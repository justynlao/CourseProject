Cam reddish got HOF clamps
Rajon Rondo and Cam Reddish with the miscommunication. Oof. You can almost see Cam Reddish's brain working it out as he glanced as Kuzma and then Caruso lmao.
"11 games into last season, Cam Reddish was averaging 5.8/3.8/1.7 on 25/19/83 in 23 mins. He ended the season on 10.5/3.7/1.5 on 38/33/80 in 27 mins. His last 11 games of the season he had 16.4/3.7/1.4 on 49/40/83 in 30 mins.   Edwards has already shown an uptick in his last 5 games and there's no reason to suggest his numbers won't be substantially better at the end of the season."
yup. cam reddish was supposed to go
cam reddish was soooooo lost on defence down the stretch in the 4q. shortly after this he got busted on a backdoor as well.
Deandre Hunter and hopefully Cam Reddish may be those wings they need.
Hawks fans... is Cam Reddish basically a clone of guys like Tony Allen?
"I honestly can‚Äôt be mad at this L. Huge shoutout to cam for playing Lebron probably as well as one can in the regular season. I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be as close without Dre, it just seems like when you don‚Äôt have one of him or reddish our depth is so thin.   If Gallo or Rondo had played better too that‚Äôd be nice, paying them quite a bit of money to not let stuff like that stretch in the 4th happen."
I remember when we were talking about drafting Cam Reddish or Hunter a few years back.
"Buying Deandre Hunter, selling Divencenzo, holding Cam reddish"
"Him and Cam Reddish (plays ~29 mpg), since that was basically the trade"
Cam Reddish and possibly Nico Mannion
Cam reddish
"John Collins.   Half ‚ÄúSorry, but he has not shown any reason to give him a bigger contract‚Äù  Half ‚ÄúI love John Collins pay the damn man‚Äù  I‚Äôd say cam reddish but I think a lot of people love him even if he‚Äôs streaky"
Easily Cam Reddish.
Cam Reddish
"Harden wanted the switch, and he got Cam fucking Reddish good luck lmao"
"Great closeout by Cam Reddish, too bad Hardens stepbacks is ungaurdable"
CAM REDDISHüî•
"John Collins, Tony Snell, Cam reddish and 2 firsts"
Cam Reddish definitely gets extended minutes and was a plus defender straight out of the gate.  Quote me in 5 years every single one of those players besides maybe Claxton due to injury will be better than Rui.
Cam Reddish
I would put cam reddish under that same category but cam somewhat knows what he‚Äôs doing
"John Collins, Tony Snell, Cam Reddish, a couple picks"
"hawks fans aren't the ones who brought it up    p.s. it's trae and cam reddish, not just trae"
"&gt;lauded for it's depth  It's not as deep as 2018 or 2019.  2019 had Zion, Ja, De'andre Hunter, Coby White, Hachimura, Garland, Reddish, Cam Johnson, Herro, NAW, Brandon Clarke, Paschall, THT, Matisse, PJ Washington, Kevin Porter Jr"
Hey he‚Äôs no trae young plus cam reddish
"The extra pick isn‚Äôt even worth talking about. Looking at the trade in a vacuum just isn‚Äôt how the NBA works. Guys like Cam are all over the NBA. The Mavs know they can sign plenty of FAs that get Cams production. He‚Äôs not even valuable to a winning franchise until he‚Äôs had time to get better and by then he‚Äôs off his rookie deal. Anytime a Hawks fan brings up that draft pick they are completely missing the point (not saying you are). You take the superstar every time. If Reddish had been some hidden mid-round gem that yall hit on, it may be a different convo..  but that‚Äôs clearly not the case."
I‚Äôm ready to drop a diss track on anyone who says cam reddish
"That if Cam Reddish was white he wouldn‚Äôt have made the NBA, because scouts only said he‚Äôs good because he‚Äôs attractive."

"&gt;reddish will be the guy for atlanta, not trae  Is this a serious take? I get that Trae is still a pretty flawed player at this point in his career, but what about Cam makes you think he projects even as an all star?"
Hoyt shit I forgot about the existence of Cam Reddish
"Beal for John Collins, Kevin Huerter, Cam Reddish and 2022 first. If you don't think that's enough then swap Hunter for Huerter or add another first."
Cam Reddish
"That‚Äôs a big upgrade over a rookie Cam Reddish, rookie Deandre Hunter, and 2nd year Kevin Huerter"
yeah if atlanta wanted a klay they wouldnt have taken cam reddish over tyler herro
"Hunter is looking like a long term piece that will be getting paid and Cam isn‚Äôt looking too good right now, but they have Trae and Hunter and or Reddish in back to back years."
Cam reddish is the only guy I‚Äôve seen Danny take successfully off the dribble and he misses the layup ü§¶üèª
"I'd argue it's worse right now. Solomon Hill is our 7th man right now, and he's filling in for center at times. 2nd year Cam Reddish is our 6th. Not sure who's up behind them. Brandon Goodwin? Bruno Fernando? one of our 2-ways?   Last season, we at least had Teague and Dedmon as 6th and 7th guys."

Wow you got cam reddish too? LOL
that‚Äôs why you should draft traits and not stats   some of these mofo‚Äôs would have taken dougie mcbuckets at 1 and Cam Reddish would went un drafted  tyrese was the most creative finisher with either hand in the draft and his shot was super legit. listen to one interview and you hear how smart he is too. crazy he dropped to 21
"Why would the Sixers ever trade Shake Milton? He's making 10 million less per year than Kennard.   I could see the Hawks trading Rondo, but definitely not for Luke Kennard when they already have...  * Trae Young * Bogdan Bogdanovic  * Kevin Huerter * Cam Reddish  * De'Andre Hunter * Kris Dunn  * Brandon Goodwin   ...to fill out their their ball-handling wing role. Also Rondo makes 10 million less per year as well."
You also have to consider Cam Reddish for MVP too üî• üî•üî•
Ah so more playing time for the bust Cam Reddish who an unusually high number of people love.
In his career Cam Reddish has missed over 42% of the dunks he has attempted.
Quite a battle [for that last spot between reddish and devonte Graham can cam reddish average more made FGs off drives than TOs](https://go.nba.com/wx4j) stay tuned
"Cam reddish, hope he gets it together tho"
Gotta throw in Cam Reddish
Hawk fans are trying to argue that they won the trade because they got Cam Reddish lol
Cam Reddish would look great in purple and orange
"Cam Reddish: ""Am I a joke to you?"""
"Trae Young, John Collins, Cam Reddish, Deandre Hunter and Clint Capela for Gordon Hayward who says no here?"
I‚Äôm fine with Cam Reddish not being on here but I think that he‚Äôs real close
TIL Anthony Edwards acquired Cam Reddish
"I'm a Hawks fan and I think now would be a solid time to jump on board.  Trae Young, Cam Reddish, Hunter -- they have a solid young core and hopefully can draw some free agents in the coming years."
Cam Reddish.
"The funny thing is that the Trae stans aren‚Äôt even active in our sub. I see more Trae stans in r/nba than I ever do over there, which is wierd. r/AtlantaHawks belongs to the Cam Reddish stans tbh"
De'Andre Hunter  He‚Äôs not going to continue shooting this well. Cam Reddish already fell back to earth.  Good luck Hawks fans. Be humble next time.
Great win but why the fuck is Cam Reddish getting almost twice as many minutes as Bogdan
Immanuel Quickley and Austin Rivers put the clamps on Trae Young and Cam Reddish.  Are the Atlanta Hawks still playoff locks even though they won 20 games last season? We will find out if they make the playoffs in 4 months.   Stay delusional Atlanta Hawks fans.
Way too much Cam Reddish lmao
cam reddish couldn‚Äôt hit water if he jumped off a boat
**94 LaMelo Ball**  **149 Michael Porter Jr**  **211 Cam Reddish**  &amp;#x200B;  did u pick these randomly lmao? this might actually be the worst post iv seen in this sub.
Not sure about Luka but I can see a good chance that the following superstars stay:  * Trae Young * De'Andre Hunter * Cam Reddish * Bruno Fernando * Brandon Knight * Kevin Heurter * John Collins
Hawk fans were memeing it. r/AtlantaHawks always makes over top comparisons like Cam Reddish is better than KD and Giannis will come to the hawks to a bench role.
"Those already started this offseason. I also saw one of those bullshit trade articles on ‚Äònbadraftanalysis.net‚Äô (thank you Google app) titled ‚ÄúThis Hawks-Lakers trade includes an intriguing young wing:  Hawks receive: Kyle Kuzma, Talen Horton Tucker   Lakers receive: Cam Reddish and a 2nd round pick‚Äù  Like, fuck no, the hawks aren‚Äôt trading their highest upside young wing for kuzma amd THT."
They were speaking of Cam reddish
"Don't forget the 2019 1st round pick, which turned into Cam Reddish. Trading down like the Hawks did is believing that Luka is going to wind up the better player (correct), but not by more than the difference between Reddish and a replacement-level player (bit early to say, but looking unlikely).  That kind of mistake is *way* smaller than what the Kings did."
Worst thing about being a young and upcoming team is that statwatching casuals come in and say nonsense like Cam Reddish is a bust. These people can't evaluate defense at all.
"Hm. Cam Reddish, De'Andre Hunter, Colin Sexton, Darius Garland, Nikola Vucevic and Markelle Fultz, respectively?"
Cam reddish equipped HOF clamps üî•
"I love Cam Reddish, I think if he gets traded he‚Äôll really have a chance to shine even more"
Everyone will say the obvious:   Ima go with Darius Garland and Cam Reddish
"As long he gets meaningful playing time this season he has a chance to improve his sophomore season. Last year Darius Garland, Jaret Culver, De'Andre Hunter, and Cam Reddish were bad. This year they have positive impact on their team."
"Hunter and Reddish are both 3 and D 6'8"" defensive specialists who can also get their own shot.  They can then funnel guys into Capela.  As CR and DH go into their third yr, they will become even better.  The Atlanta Hawks are LOADED.  Add JC, Trae, Bogdan, Gallo, Okungwu, Rondo, Dunn.  DEEP and talented.  The funny thing is, nobody wanted Cam Reddish, instead they wanted Zion and Barrett.  Both are good but Cam's ceiling is higher."
"Probably, but better than Trae and Cam Reddish? Don‚Äôt think so"
Did you see how Cam Reddish fathered KD last night?
"I remember thinking their GM was insane for all the shit he's pulled the past 3 seasons. Trading down for Trae, calling Huerter and Young the next great PG, drafting Cam Reddish and Hunter in the same draft. But fuck man Omari Spell man has been his only bad pick."
&gt; with so much Luka slander in between  This sub acted like Cam Reddish was worth trading him for
Cam Reddish isn't very good yet. Definitely not a solid starter at this point in his career
Kyrie Irving is unguardable. De‚ÄôAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish didn‚Äôt lock him up. Embarrassing takes. Probably the same people that think Kevin Love locked up Wardell Stephen Curry II in the Finals.  Bad shooting night from Kyrie Irving.... it happens in the regular season. Thank god it doesn‚Äôt happen in the Finals like Wardell Stephen Curry II.
Cam Reddish + DeAndre Hunter = WingStop
can you believe all we did to get cam reddish was give the mavs some fat european?
Hey we‚Äôre in garbage time because Cam Reddish and DeAndre Hunter put the clamps on Kyrie AGAIN. I ain‚Äôt mad.
Watching DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish locking up Kyrie and KD (as much as anyone can) makes me so optimistic about the future.
That‚Äôs Cam ‚ÄúLiterally worst player in NBA history‚Äù Reddish to you bub
Cam Reddish is not afraid of Durant. I hope he works hard in the offseason cause he could become a star
Cam Reddish stock skyrocketing
Why do trae young and cam reddish get more respect from the refs than kyrie and Durant. Durant clearly gets fouled there.
Mavs ended up with Luka from that draft despite having only the 5th pick so it's a win for them.   Hawks got Trae with the 3rd pick plus a good prospect in Cam Reddish so it's a win from them.
"The Hawks.  Trae Young is a better player than Luka Donƒçiƒá. Trae Young will also have a better career than Luka Donƒçiƒá. Cam Reddish is a decent player, but he is not a Kyrie Irving stopper."
"I think Romeo Langford can be a really solid player in the future. If cam reddish fixes his efficiency issues he will be a problem. Also JJJ, dude can be a beast"
"Cam Reddish, he will have a good second half of the season.   Not really flying under the radar, but DeAndre Hunter will surprise people again when he gets back from injury in a couple of weeks."
Cam Reddish. He wasn‚Äôt good at Duke and still was a lottery pick. Now he‚Äôs also not good in the NBA.
"I don't think many people deny that. I would just argue that the Trae pick has turned out about as well as you could've expected and it's unfair that people blame him for the trade being lopsided. It's Cam Reddish that's not evening out.  If he were like year 2/3 Otto Porter, people would say the trade is a lot more even."
Luka for Trae and Cam Reddish. Who says no?
Shouldn't Cam Reddish be on the list? 26% from three point shooting and 82% FT.
"Cam Reddish. Weird to say since he‚Äôs been pretty bad but he is a really good defender and can be streaky around the rim with his forgotten size. Points, Boards, Assists, Steals  He‚Äôd no doubt follow it up with a -15"
Cam Reddish. My man is a roller coaster of emotions
Man I really wish the hawks could put it all together. Cam Reddish/Clint Capela/Trae Young/DeAndre Hunter/John Collins would be a really good frontcourt. Hopefully we can see it in the 2nd half
Cam Reddish is the best player in the league against the Nets tho wtf
People aren‚Äôt taking victory laps about him being bad it‚Äôs just highlighting how on the totality of his career the following are his shooting splits   57% from the rim  33% from 3-10 feet   31% from 10-16 feet   36% from 16-22 ft   31% from 3  His defense is fine but he clearly has yet to show he can score from any level of the court with any kind of consistency. For a guy repeatedly comp‚Äôd to Paul George and labeled this ‚Äúuntouchable asset‚Äù. It all just highlights what a massive curve fans grade young players on and how devoid from reality it often can be. In the backdrop of all this is people overhyping Reddish because of his connection to the Doncic trade There are many many ex beyond Cam Reddish where people do this every year
Cam Reddish is a career 55% shooter on dunks.
People took so many victory laps on cam reddish because of some 20 game sample size late last season
Man i‚Äôd take Cam Reddish
Holy shit Cam Reddish
Is there something I‚Äôm missing here about cam reddish.  He‚Äôs shooting 36.5% from the fields that‚Äôs garbage
"If it‚Äôs got nothing to do with criticism or being picked on it‚Äôs probably not what I‚Äôm referencing. I think rotational issues, bad plays, and friction with Trae and saying he hates his play style are all reasonable complaints. Like I said, the cam reddish example is one that stood out to me and I‚Äôd be interested to see other players gripes in more detail. Like Collins for example, he was suspended a large portion of last season and he‚Äôs still complaining about the role he has even though it sounded like they were trying to trade him. I just think it‚Äôs weird to complain to reporters about little shit that any player could say about any coach. ‚ÄúHe picks on me‚Äù yeah whatever"
T[Trae young speaking to JC Cam reddish and Clint Capea in the Hawks locker room ](https://youtu.be/Bflkr8_cocM)
Atlanta hoping that Cam Reddish will flourish under McMillan is typical Atlanta behavior.
"Yes we'll never really know, we can only make assumptions. But imo Collins' complaint seemed fair. Reddish meanwhile complaining about being ""picked on"" just feels off to me. In my experience, people that think they're exclusively being targeted and picked on are usually problematic themselves. I doubt Pierce just had it out for Cam for some wild reason.  But you're right, there's no way of truly knowing"
"Idk, I think being young and getting upset because your coach is hard on you is a bad attitude but hey that‚Äôs just me. That Cam Reddish example of getting ‚Äúpicked on‚Äù is the one that jumps out to me"
"&gt; Cam Reddish was among those, sources said, who also had an issue with Pierce‚Äôs coaching. Sources said Reddish felt like he was being ‚Äúpicked on‚Äù behind the scenes when it came to mistakes the second-year player made  I like his game but he sounds like a brat tbh. Just accept criticism and get better  &gt; Pierce took the tough love approach with Young from Day 1, opting to push him hard as a way of maximizing his celebrated talent. But Young, who had inspired so much hype during his time coming up in (and at) Oklahoma, often pushed back against Pierce‚Äôs style.  Seems like it worked? He became an All-Star starter his second season"
At one point in the article they said people on the team believed Cam Reddish could be the best on the team.
he was holding Cam Reddish back
"Reading the article, it sounds like Pierce lost not just Trae's support but most of the team, including John Collins, Cam Reddish, and others.. Just sounds like communication and trust was gone."
"Check his stats, he struggle in early January. Besides that he is actually pretty consistent. Bogan only played 9 game, their second best player Hunter already missed 12 game, cam reddish regressed and injuries. Rondo missed half of the season. That not really fair to evaluate a team isn‚Äôt it?"
"also Cam Reddish, who is ATL's best defender on the perimeter. I remember reading that in the 3 games against ATL, KD shot 6-21-24 against him, (dont remember the actual number but it began w 2)"
"Right in high school he was the number two recruit.  So were Austin Rivers, Cam Reddish, Shabazz Muhammed, Skal, Mudiay, and Giles.  So he got hurt in college and the reddit consensus was that he was still as talented as Ayton/Doncic/Bagley when he would have had plenty of opportunity to play himself down the rankings as a tweener that can't defend and had zero IQ at the time.  He's turning out pretty good but there's little evidence that he'd be significantly better had he avoided injury despite this sub thinking that"
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9. Keldon Johnson (#29)   Other players that outperformed their picks include Brandon Clarke (#21), Grant Williams (#22) and Kendrick Nunn (undrafted).  Players that dropped out of my top 10: Darius Garland, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, but all of them would probably be in the 11-20 range"
Cam reddish special
I was finna say Mavs won the trade but I forgot Hawks got Cam Reddish out of it.... :/
"Repeat from a similar post a few weeks back:  Kris Dunn over Hield and Jamal Murray hurts  Trading #19 (which was Kevin Huerter) for Adreien Payne and then taking Okogie at 20 (the back end of that draft was mediocre to be fair)  The Butler trade was a year too early and he clearly didn‚Äôt fit with Wiggins/KAT personality-wise  Some bad luck (missed out on Bam by two picks) compounded by bad decisions (taking Justin Patton with OG and Jarrett Allen on the board, drafting Culver with Rui and Cam Reddish available, could have stayed at 11 and had Herro/PJ Washington/Cam Johnson).  Missing out on two top-10 picks inside of 4 years will hurt any franchise. Add in poor player development and the ‚Äúwe‚Äôve gotta make the playoffs!‚Äù mentality, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for a disaster. The Wiggins trade was just another cherry on top"
"No, if you actually watch our games (as painful as that is) you'll see that getting open perimeter shots aren't generally our problem on offense. Danilo Gallinari and Cam Reddish have been shooting bricks the whole month. We are missing our second and fourth best offensive players and it is showing."
WingStop - De‚ÄôAndre Hunter &amp; Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish
"Darius Bazley, Cam Reddish, and Dillon Brooks come to mind."
"Cam Reddish, tho he had a great game last night and still at worst has elite defense"
"Cam ""Fuck Lloyd Pierce"" Reddish"
"Cam Reddish went 10th too, and Tre Young went 41st the next year. That starting lineup was absurdly stacked.   But they didn't have Cassius Winston."
Realistically what would it take to get cam reddish
It was odd seeing Young so passive. People will knock the foul baiting but he didn't even try it after it was working all game. He did generate some open shots but imo I'd rather Trae do whatever than give Cam Reddish  3s his shot looked *bad* tonight
Cam Reddish and Kevin Huerter really wanted to lose this game
Looks like I can exhale. Randle was amazing. Noel was great. but I'm glad Huerter had an off night and Cam Reddish was the one who shot 8 3s.
I‚Äôm not sure what Cam Reddish is good at
Honestly AD is done tbh. We‚Äôll take him off your hands for cam reddish and cash considerations. I‚Äôm willing to take the bullet for a fellow basketball fan.
"How is it any more special than last years‚Äôs draft or the year before‚Äôs?  Last year‚Äôs draft had Zion, Ja, RJ, Hunter, Garland, Coby White, Cam Reddish, Cam Johnson, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro  And that‚Äôs all just the lottery guys. Lot of other gems outside of it too"
"Cam Reddish was quietly kind of a turd at Duke. 35% shooting overall, 33% from 3pt.  On low volume, on relatively easy shots, on a team with very strong drive-and-kick game.  Averaged 1.9 AST to 2.7 TO.  Reddish went under the radar as a fairly terrible player while he was there."
"Haven't been right, period, can't go 2 weeks without a starter being out for 6-8 weeks but even then Cam Reddish is total ass, Young is back to being swarmed every play because he's the only guy doing anything, and John Collins is about to get offered a max contract by some dumbass team despite zero evidence he can do anything outside the post"
A Mavs/Hawks trade? maybe they can throw in Cam Reddish to complete the loop
"yeah if you think Zion Williamson, Cam Reddish, Barrett, and Tre Jones when they were in college could compete with Real Madrid or Olympiacos I can't help you"
"You just gave a great example... That Duke team with Zion Williamson, Cam Reddish, Barrett, and Tre Jones couldn't compete with a top Euro-league team? I'm not talking about Euro League Team featuring Gasol or an extreme outlier in Luka.  Remember LaMelo Ball with his ragtag group was playing 2nd Div in Lithuania.  They were doing just fine. Yea they struggled against 1st division competition.  But it wasn't to the level of being non-competitive.  I literally gave you instance of 4 teams 2012 UK, 1998 UK, 2001 Duke, you can throw in 1999 UConn. Then you have 2009 UNC,2007 Florida that were college teams loaded with above-average NBA talent, and were above average as soon at they took the floor the following year. Thats 6 teams in 22 years that just won the NCAA Championship.  That excludes Teams like Zion's Duke Team, or Wall/Cousin's UK Team, or the UCLA Team with Love, Westbrook, Memphis who had D-Rose, CDR, and Joey Dorsey who didn't win the title.  You are trying to argue, that a team who's BEST player is at best a rotational player in the NBA can beat a college team with multiple players who are capable of being rotational players or starters.  Look at those roster's of the teams I provided, and look what they did in their NBA careers within 3 years of being in the NBA.  Now overlay that Euroleague Teams and their Rosters.  I personally wouldn't bet my life savings on that game.  I'm saying I wouldn't take a bet on who would win that game.  Because I know how 'high-end' talent works in the Basketball.  Its not that crazy.  Its no different than saying a top 4x400 USA College Team could make the an Olympic Finals or WC Finals.  Now its very easy to measure because we have a stop watch.  Why is it possible? Because again, they may have 3 guys who are 'Good' who can run low 46s and high 45s.  But they prob all have a absolute workhorse Michael Norman who can compete individually on the world stage. Running 44s and lower."
"I'm a little disappointed at home Cam Reddish has been playing. Was a fan of his out of Duke and was hoping to see some good stuff out of him this year. He's had good moments, but I feel like a see more games like tonight from him than not."
"Hunter loss is brutal, because you know damn well that Cam Reddish ain't stepping up for the Hawks."
"Cam Reddish is hyped because he played for Duke, but he‚Äôs not all that."
Nope. They got Cam Reddish.
"I still have to disagree with you on the free throw part. The turn of the new year was when Trae started his horrible slump, which lasted til the 15th. In that stretch, he was  only attempting 5.6 per game, which is totally buoyed by one game where he took 15. But since he broke out of it, he‚Äôs taken at least 11 free throws in all but 2 games. 11.9 per game over the last 10 games, only *slightly* down from his pace of 15.5 to start the year. It‚Äôs really important to note that Trae was not playing like his normal self whatsoever during that slump, he was really stinking it the fuck up. It looks like he‚Äôs gonna keep drawing double digit attempts a game for a while.  I do have to agree that he is a serial flopper though. A lot of it is just genuinely smart plays that punish guys for guarding him so closely - which you have to because of his range and his deadly floater game. But yeah he does flop his ass off.  I think that we should go all-in for Oladipo this off-season and let Collins walk. Love the guy, he‚Äôs an awesome player, but he turned down 90+ mil so he can go fuck himself. Hunter as the long-term 4 is very ideal, and if Cam Reddish can ever be remotely consistent offensively he‚Äôs gonna be an absolute stud. He‚Äôs already getting close to the tier of the best perimeter defenders in the league. I think with that roster setup, we‚Äôre gonna see Trae around 25 points and 10 assists per game and one of the best offenses in the league, especially with a bench unit featuring Huerter, Bogi, Gallo, Okongwu, and hopefully a good point guard. The defense would also be awesome on that starting five. There‚Äôs a lot that needs to go right but I really think this team is one piece and some development (and *maybe* a better coach) away from true title contention. I really wanna make the playoffs this year to get the experience under our belts"
Send Drew's number to my boi Cam Reddish
not just Bogi and Gallo but Hunter and Cam Reddish have been out for the majority of the year as well. In the last month especially Trae has really upped his game
1. Cam Reddish will be an all star or superstar. Baby harden left hand great size just needs opportunity. 2. Lamelo will be better than doncic  3. After the nets 3 peat Kyrie will be considered better than Curry  4. Dejaun Wagner jr will be better than or around dame lillard level.
"You're not looking at WHO we've been missing. De'Andre Hunter, Cam Reddish, and Kris Dunn have not played in months except for two games Hunter came back for. Those are our three best perimeter defenders. When we had Hunter and Reddish both healthy and playing we were a top ten defense. Since then we were like 22nd or something the last time I checked. You made the point that you hide a poor defender by surrounding him with good defenders. Well, we have done that. They've just been injured for months lmao."
"The Hawks have been missing Cam Reddish, DeAndre Hunter, Okongwu for the first 20 games, now we are missing John Collins, before we had Capela go down, then Bogdanovic and then Gallo.  Heck, when we had Rondo, he barely played and we STILL haven't played a single minute with Dunn.  Every club has injuries.  Even the Lakers and even the Celtics.  The core of the team is Tatum first and then Brown.  When you have those two all-stars, most teams don't need more than that.  The problem with the Celtics is that they are top heavy.  After Tatum and Brown, you don't have any starter caliber players.   Fournier is not a star.  The Magic with him, Ross, Gordon and Nikola Vucevic still looked bad.  Then IMHO, they trade for Fournier but should have traded for Vucevic.  The problem is your GM, Danny Ainge.  Outside of Tatum and Brown, nothing.  Could have had James Harden."
"The second pick was part of how the Hawks drafted Cam Reddish. Reddish still has some time to maybe develop into a solid piece, but anyone who ways that Dallas didn't win the trade outright is just homering it up."
It also means their trade value is alot lower than taking a 19-20 yr old if they end up disappointing. Cam Reddish for example would still be a great trade piece. If he were 24-25? You're looking at Delon Wright who was traded for two 2nd picks.
It could be worse... You could have cam reddish instead
I was told it‚Äôs idiotic to say Hayes is a better prospect than trade asset Cam Reddish as recently as two weeks ago
"I can't laugh - like I said, I haven't watched him. The one game he played against the Sixers, he was matched up with Dakota Mathias due to the Sixers missing most of their roster due to COVID protocol. Mathias is, as far as I can tell, completely out of the league after getting cut by the Sixers in January.  I've actually written a lot about the Age 23 Leap. [This](http://www.busterducks.com/2017/reference-series-age/) is from 2017 and it's been updated a bit by various other articles I wrote, but that's probably still the most succinct breakdowns of it. Hunter was one of the worst players in the league as a 22 year old and may have morphed into a decent or better player as a 23 year old. Such is the power of the Age 23 Leap.  I always make it clear that ultimately, draft projection is just that - projection. I hit on about 60% of my projections, which puts me above literally every national analyst (and most NBA teams), but also means that I miss on about 40% of my projections. A lot of fans think projection is a lot more predictable it is, but there's nothing predictable about it. If I asked you, right now: Will Cam Reddish develop a 3P shot by the time he turns 25? You can make an educated guess, but it's just a guess, and being right about it doesn't make anybody smart or dumb, it's basically just a 50/50 chance right now. If he develops a 3P shot, he's a good or better 3-and-D wing who should be starting. If he doesn't, he's an end of the bench guy. I've found that most fans don't like to accept that there's more random chance involved on a lot of these guys than some sort of magical foresight.  As a result, I have some beautiful hits - I had Moses Brown as a first rounder, when nobody else had him as draftable. I also have some hilarious misses - I had Jeremiah Martin as a first rounder, when nobody else had him as draftable. But the fact that there's ""consensus"" on more than a handful of players is always wild to me, because so much of the draft is pure guesswork that there really shouldn't be agreement on most players."
The Hawks were able to get Cam Reddish and De‚ÄôAndre Hunter with the extra pick otherwise they only would‚Äôve gotten of one them.
"&gt;For tonight‚Äôs game at New Orleans: John Collins (left ankle sprain) is out. Danilo Gallinari (left Achilles soreness) is out. De‚ÄôAndre Hunter (right knee soreness) is out.

I dare you to make a 3  PG: Ben Simmons SG: Cam Reddish SF: Josh Jackson PF: Giannis C: Rudy Gobert
Cam Reddish against the Nets
"A Duke reunion would be fun, too bad the pel GM took Jaxon Hayes over Cam Reddish"
Hawks don‚Äôt have kriss dunn deandre hunter okongwu capela and cam reddish
"Are you high?  What is a WNBA player going to do to Cam Reddish? Except get murdered?  Cmon you sound stupid, the average WNBA player is 5'9 the average NBA player is 6'7 216 pounds.  It's like playing against a kid. I shouldn't even respond to you, because anyone who believes that bullshit you said knows nothing about basketball."
"Ah yes Moses Brown, the guy who, for some reason, lead my 2025 Spurs to a title along with Wendell Carter Jr and Cam Reddish, in NBA 2K16... it wasn't always pretty but it worked."
Dudley just got injured so maybe him.  Isn‚Äôt Cam Reddish in a walking boot right now too? Probably him
Cam Reddish a lockdown artist but he can have some bad defensive games that kill some of his defensive metrics.
Ah yes. Defensive legend Cam Reddish
" Just to see what the results would be, I checked this websites advanced defensive metric to see what each would score and how they stack up. (For reference Gobert is top of the league with +4.32 and Anfernee Simons is bottom of the league with -2.71)  1) Lu Dort   \-1.03  2) Dillon Brooks   \+0.57  3) Gary Harris   \-0.49  4) Mikal Bridges   \+0.39  5) Royce O'Neale   \+1.11  6) Lonzo Ball   \-0.68  7) Pat Beverley   \+1.70  8) Cam Reddish   \-0.56  9) Derrick Jones Jr.   \+0.68  10) Josh Okogie   \+0.17"
"Nope, RJ was the unanimous #1 recruit coming out of high school. Most places had Zion in the 3-5 range behind Nassir Little and Cam Reddish. It was kinda BS because Zion stayed local and didn‚Äôt really play much in some of the big tournaments for high school players like RJ did, which is why he got rated lower   Most people could tell Zion would be better but technically RJ was the higher rated recruit"
"While true the teams the hawks have beaten in this stretch were injured, the hawks are missing a couple players who typically get big minutes in Deandre Hunter and Cam Reddish.  Bogdonavic just came back from injury and is getting back into the swing of things.   And honestly, to win 4 straight immediately after transitioning head coaches is pretty impressive in and of itself"
Cam Reddish?
"Hes more of a veteran savvy kind of guy. Dunn, Reddish, and Hunter are legit clamps. Hunter and Cam don‚Äôt have a reputation right now, but when they were healthy alongside Capela the Hawks were a top 8 defense."
"The Hawks only wing defenders are all out.  Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish, Kris Dunn. Not as sever as the Raps, but still not full strength."
"Non catch and shoot shots including cuts...   And those are LOW frequency for any young scorer. Compare that to even lower tier scoring young player in our league today. That frequency literally rivals that of fucking Deandre Hunter, a guy who Hawks fans would STILL say has less superstar potential than even Cam Reddish.   He‚Äôs averaging 17.2. 33.5 catch and shoot frequency. 45.3 0 dribbles frequency. Those are nearly identical to Kawhis. Like do you not realize how low those are for some of the young scorers in the league? Do you not see why those aren‚Äôt enough flashes for him to be firmly put above someone like Wiggins ?  Hunters numbers rival 2015 Kawhis. Anthony Edwards numbers are MUCH worse than rookie year Wiggins. Yet most people would still say Antman has more SUPERSTAR potential than Hunter.   Doesn‚Äôt even matter here, Zion clearly is a different breed."
"Missing DeAndre Hunter, Cam Reddish and Dunn still, so our entire perimeter defense  We‚Äôve also been putrid on offense this second half"
Don't be silly. He had a bad half so we should trade him for Cam Reddish.
What most people forget/dont know is the Hawks also got the pick that turned into Cam Reddish...Now while he hardly has looked like a stud there is no denying his potential and even though his offence has been sketchy he has been a damn good defender...lets revisit trade in another year or two.
Maybe. Still too early to tell. He and Cam Reddish have just barely even played 82 total games yet. I hope one of them is the answer because otherwise idk where that player is coming from
"Would still 100% rather have Luka, but Trae and Cam Reddish is a pretty great combo to have too."
\+ Cam Reddish
"The only major player who's out for us right now is Cam Reddish, other than that, Hunter returned last game and will probably be good to go come playoffs."
Cam Reddish lol...
"Give Cam Reddish the Skill boost; dude becomes PG-13  Give Trae the size boost; defense improves probably   Give Hunter the athleticism boost; let him yam, beat people off the dribble, and jump out the gym even more"
Rockets/Hawks  Height boost: Trae and Jae Sean tate    Skill boost: Cam reddish and Kenyon Martin jr   Athleticism boost: Trae or Gallo and Christian Wood
"Height boost: Trae Young. 6‚Äô4 Trae with his skill would be the best offensive guard in the league, easy  Athleticism boost: bogdan bogdanovic, if he had a great first step and dunk-in-traffic ability he and Trae in this scenario are the most potent backcourt in the league, up there with prime Steph and Klay  Skill boost: Cam reddish. He is the one player on the roster with all the tools: height, natural talent, length, instincts: if his actual skill level catches up to his body he‚Äôs a top two way player in the league easily   Sigh, if only this were real"
"He's been amazing, but this prob isn't true  Garland, Coby White, Cam Johnson, Herro, then other borderline guys like Goga, KPJ, Deandre Hunter, Reddish, PJ Washington who Barrett is prob beating out but not by that much"
I think cam reddish can still be an all star
* Cam Reddish will never be a good NBA player. Those who saw him in college know this. Reddish had a small fragment last season where he wasn't hot-garbage and Hawks fans thought he had turned a corner.  * Anfernee Simmons could carve out a very decent role on a solid team. His 3pt shot % increase may be unsustainable though.  * Mo Bamba needs to switch teams.  * Bol Bol I have absolutely 0 clue what you do with him if you give him big minutes.  Kevin Knox is a garbage NBA player. Wendell Carter I think can still become a good center one day.
Wiggins/Ayton/Michael Beasley/Kevin Knox/Cam Reddish/ insert any ‚Äúall the tools‚Äù guys
Reminds me of the time Cam Reddish got yelled at by HC assistant last year
Cam Reddish and Trae Young. Cam had some big games when Trae was out last year.
"Probably had something to do with that meniscus tear he had lol, not everything's a conspiracy bro. Things like Cam Reddish missing 3/4 of and eventually being shut down for the season over achilles ""soreness"" and whatever is going on with KD this year are way fishier as far as injury report/load management fuckery goes than a non-playoff team keeping a 19 year old coming of knee surgery in his first NBA season on a minutes restriction."
Cam Reddish
Either Deandre Hunter or Cam Reddish.
"&gt;no idea how they got blown out by the Pistons though the night after  half the team is injured.   Trae Young, Lou Williams, DeAndre Hunter, Cam Reddish, Tony Snell were all out and Kevin Huerter and Brandon Goodwill both left the game injured."
Jaylen Brown  Jalen Green  Coby White  Michael Redd  Tarik Black  Aaron Gray  Derek Rose  Hassan Whiteside  Cam Reddish  Red Robbins
Desperately needed bench reinforcements at the right time. Now if Reddish and Cam could come back I think we could be in good position to possibly take that 4 seed back.
Here's a more accurate depth chart  PG: Trae Young/ Lou Williams/ Kris Dunn / Brandon Goodwin  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic/ Kevin Huerter  SF: Deandre Hunter/ Tony Snell/ Cam Reddish  PF: John Collins/ Danilo Gallinari/ Solomon Hill  C: Clint Capela/ Onyeka Okungwu/ Nathan Knight  Imo Tony Snell has taken the backup SF from Cam this season. But there's still some basketball left to be played and he could take it back if he returns from injury.
Someone destroyed me in MyTeam by making fadeaway threes with his OP Cam Reddish the whole game so yea lol
The fact you think Reddish was some player blocking Bogdan this year tells me you haven't watched the hawks enough.  Cam started and played 3 games better than Bogdan to start the year.  Then Bogdan got hurt and came back in game 35.  Cam played until game 31 and has been out since.
"&gt;h of the first half of the season...because bogdanovic was injured and not playing  He was healthy for a part of it but was trash due to LP being an idiot. Before we fired LP, Cam Reddish had our 5th highest WAR at 0.1. Kevin had a -0.2 and Bogi had a -0.6. Gallo was at 0.0. Everyone else but Trae, Capela, JC, Hunter had a negative who had enough mins played. Now look at it, Kevin and Bogi's play has been great since LP was fired. Everyone took a jump who played after LP was fired."
"Deandre Hunter (our second leading scorer this season), Kris Dunn, Cam Reddish, Tony Snell."
"I am not a Hawks fan but I really believe in Cam Reddish. He will put it together and be an great role player as his floor. Some of his best moments are show how insane his natural skill level is and he is super long, super tall. I think he has grown in height and strength a lot since draft combine. He looks massive compared to other wings to me. Floor of Trevor Ariza, ceiling of someone like current Jaylen Brown as an absolute reach if everything comes together for him."
These duke boys are really likable. Hey hawks fans how Cam Reddish doing? Im sure he is gonna show up out of nowhere at some point as well.
"Seems like the consensus among the advanced and impact metrics say Luka's about 2-4 wins better than Trae right now. Now that's ignoring fit and team building so who knows, but they'd likely be close to the 3 seed. The problem for Atlanta is really Reddish, sure you'd take Doncic now obviously, but they still got a very good player in Trae. Adding the 10th pick could have been enough to make the value pretty darn close, say they drafted Cam Johnson instead, or Brandon Clarke, but Reddish has been a negative so far."
Cam Reddish fucking sucks
"Hawks gotta be up there. You're losing Trae, Clint, and JC.  LouWill, Bogi, Gallo, De'Andre Hunter, Nathan ""The Dark"" Knight, Kevin ""So Big It Might"" Huerter, Cam Reddish, Tony Snell, Okongwu all left over. Pick your poison"
"Even after we‚Äôve added Fournier? How, and why?  And are you going to play Cam Reddish and D‚ÄôAndre Hunter nearly 40 mins a game like the other guy is saying?"
"Ok, say McMillan says ‚ÄúCam, we are going to play you every minute (about 36) that Jaylen Brown is on the floor. Your sole purpose is to guard him. If you can limit him to 20, that‚Äôs going to be great‚Äù.  Cam can limit Jaylen to 20, whilst giving you 8 of his own, on even WORSE shooting than what Jaylen is putting up. Jaylen Brown‚Äôs shooting efficiency is .593 TS% so you‚Äôre telling jokes if you think he‚Äôs an inefficient chucker.   What happens when somebody needs to double Tatum? Is Cam excluded from that play? What if Cam is switched onto Kemba in a PNR situation and Trae is switched onto Jaylen. Do you send Cam to double Jaylen and leave Kemba wide open?  Or you‚Äôre ok with living with a 4 on 5 scenario with Jayson Tatum on the floor?  Who will be sent for the help defense? Will it be Capela? Cause Capela is such a versatile, switchable defender like Siakam and Bam are.  No I forgot, D‚ÄôAndre Hunter is going to slow him down.  The entire game is going to consist of 1 on 1 matchups between Tatum/Hunter and Jaylen/Reddish, and Atlanta are going to win the +/- of those matchups lmao."
"Jaylen Brown averaged 19.5ppg on 18/48 shooting against us with Cam has his primary defender. Is he:   A) An inefficient chucker   B) Able to be affected and slowed down by Cam Reddish and that's why he shot 18/48   It literally has to be one of these, which is it? And you've really devolved to insults, like immediately. So funny"
"he almost single handedly lifts hawks defense to around top 15, which is really really good considering your players. hawks would be soo fun to watch if u guys didnt battle with injuries this much. deandre hunter and cam reddish were amazing in the beginning of the season, specially hunter :/ but still, after getting bogdan and gallo and mcmillan, hawks are pretty fun to watch"
22.Ayton Desmond bane Jimmy Butler Richaun Holmes Caris LeVert Khris Middleton Larry Nance Otto Porter Cam Reddish Matisse Thybulle Andrew Wiggins not many stars but good ass players
PG - Russell Westbrook SG - Rodney Hood SF - Cam Reddish PF - Carmelo Anthony C - James Wiseman Bench - Hassan Whiteside Bench - Marcus Morris Bench - Derrick Jones Bench - Nerlens Noel Bench - Torrey Craig Bench - Eric Bledsoe Bench - Kelly Oubre  This team is a a disaster defensively and the stagnation offensively would be atrocious.
"Trae along with Cam Reddish, Bluish, and Brownish don‚Äôt make up for one Luka."
"And John Collins, DeAndre Hunter, Cam Reddish and Kris Dunn"
You said RJ carried him which is a top 5 casual fan comment I‚Äôve read on here . RJ was an inefficient chucker and Cam Reddish was ass. Zion was the only player on Duke who dominated nightly. It‚Äôs also weird how every time Zion plays the Grizzlies it‚Äôs a Pels blowout win. Very strange that this happens since Ja is just so much better.
Don't forget him saying Cam Reddish dropped 50 on him in a high school game
They drafted Cam Reddish who's currently injured. Jury is still out on his potential.
Is cam reddish a bust?
"From an outsiders perspective‚Ä¶. Luka on the Hawks makes them better.    But if I were a Hawks fan‚Ä¶. I wouldn‚Äôt stress the deal either. Something about Trae‚Äôs personality works for Atlanta.    And if Cam Reddish can get it all together, that makes it a win for Atlanta too"
Please Cam Reddish come back for us!!!
"Thing is you are comparing him to the picks before him...aka Luka. It's because that trade was seen negatively at the time. What people forget is ATL also got a protect first round pick, which turned in to cam reddish. I always thought Trae young was the truth because I loved the fact that him and Baker Mayfield were the star players for Oklahoma. But yeah. The reason people think what you're saying is because Trae and Luka will forever be intertwined in comparisons."
Yea but apparantly we would have taken Reddish at 4 so Hunter is the guy we got extra  Either way Cam is gonna be special too I believe it  Also fuck your username Go Gators baby :)
Let's be honest Cam Reddish being out is prolly good for y'all
And Cam Reddish and Kris Dunn
I'm not sure they did if you also account for cam reddish
Cam Reddish
hawks need cam reddish
"Losing sucks. But hopefully this run can lure a star to come team up with Trae Young. At the very least, being fully healthy next year in the playoffs with DeAndre Hunter and Cam reddish would be nice to see."
Please just put Cam Reddish in. I don't want to see Solomon Hill play basketball
"They got cam reddish, don't they?"
You left out that the Hawk's medical staff has fully cleared Cam Reddish. :)
Deandre Hunter? Cam Reddish are two best perimeter defenders. The Deandre Hunter that guarded Randle and shut him down?
"Yeah you‚Äôre right rj barret, Nasir little, and cam reddish were much better at 17"
"Trae Young, Cam Reddish, Deandre Hunter, and Hawks legends Carmelo Anthony."
"Sure but the excuse is weak as hell when every other team is missing key guys on top of role players being injured. If everyone else was healthy then maybe it would matter but that's not the case. Th Bucks are the ONLY team left in the playoffs without an injury to a top 3 guy aside from the Hawks (who are missing 2 key role players).   Jazz: Conley out, Mitchell hobbled  Clippers: Kawhi out, Ibaka out for the playoffs  Suns: CP3 Covid?  Nets: Harden missed 4 games and is still injured, Kyrie inured, Jeff Green missed time, Dinwiddie injured, LMA retired.  Hawks: Cam Reddish and Deandre Hunter are out 76ers: Embiid is playing injured.   It's pretty clear why Donte being out shouldn't matter considering they're supposed to be a contender and every other team is missing someone or has an injury to someone of more importance.   Lakers, Nuggets, and Celtics were missing their 2nd best player as well this playoffs. If you aren't missing a top 3 guy you have no excuse.   You don't see Clippers fans saying ""Ibaka is injured! He's very important to our team!"" Because it doesn't matter, if you have your top guys you have to get it done when EVERYONE is missing players."
"First team all-hospital:  CP3, Kyrie, Kawhi, AD, Embiid  Second team all-hospital:  Conley, Murray, Harden, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams  Honorable mentions: Kemba, Cam Reddish, Donte Divincenzo, Jeff Green, Jayson Tatum for like half of game 2"
"Hawks also don‚Äôt have DeAndre Hunter or Cam Reddish, two of our best perimeter defenders."
The Bucks and the Suns are the least injured so it is their championship to lose:   Bucks   * DiVincenzo out  * Bud brain damaged    Nets   * Kyrie sprained ankle  * Harden bad hamstring    Hawks   * De'Andre Hunter out  * Cam Reddish achilles issue  * Trae Young shoulder issue    76ers   * Embiid meniscus  * Simmons shooting stroke     Suns   * CP covid (hopefully he will be out of the protocol by the time they play the next round)    Clippers   * Kawhi knee issue    Jazz   * Conley bad hamstring  * Mitchell bad ankle
"Man management - LP is a terrible man manager. Everyone of his players hated him. He lobbied to other coaches that Trae shouldn't make the all-star game. Told Trae to wait his turn when it comes to representing the U.S after Pop chose Derrick White over him. Publicly complained about how Trae draws fouls. It come out after his firing that Cam Reddish felt that he was being bullied by LP. John Collins asked for a bigger role in the offense and LP called him selfish. Players said he was unapproachable and regularly lobbied for change through his assistants.    Terrible rotations - For some reason he had a hard on for giving Bruno Fernando minutes even though everyone could see Bruno Fernando is a bonafide scrub and we have a Okongwu our 1st round pick who is 10x the player he is just sitting on the bench. Regularly ran out trash lineups for far too long. We'd be up big with 4 minutes left in the 3rd and down double digits with 8 minutes left in the 4th.    No schemes - He literally doesn't have an offensive or defensive scheme. His scheme was hope Trae puts up 40pts and 15asts.    Also Bogi's injury came back ahead of schedule after LP was fired. Take that for what you will. LP is a terrible coach and I hope any eastern team takes him and gives us free wins next season. We had 11 blown 4th quarter leads with LP and became the best 4th quarter team in the league with McMillan. LP doesn't know when to call timeouts, doesn't ever hold himself accountable and I genuinely can't think of one positive thing when it comes to LP's coaching."
Hawks would win it all if Cam Reddish wasnt hurt. Cant prove me wrong. Thats how dumb you sound.
Not necessarily. We lost DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish.
So the people who record the data think Trae is a better defender then Cam Reddish got it let's put Trae on Tobi from now on
we're still missing deandre hunter/cam reddish and trae has a mysterious shoulder issue (that he admittedly played through in game 4)
Isnt def RTG based off stats and shot pct And HEAVILY Decided by who you guard stats can be misleading especially if Cam Reddish is Guarding Tobias Harris and Trae is Guarding Shake Milton :/  Put Cams DRTG around other wing defenders and actually watch some film and make a Informed decision
Hill already didn't play in game 4 and Snell only played 7 minutes. The smaller the rotation the better in the playoffs.  I didn't realize Hawks fans actually liked Cam Reddish.
"Cam Reddish being out is addition by subtraction, he's horrible.   Hunter is an actual blow though"
Cam reddish and Deandre Hunter would like to have a word with you
"Yes you are kinda half right.  Anyone team trading away Luka 2018 draft night loses the trade. You are right. Luka is miles better than any player in the draft, and losing him for Trae Young, Cam and a later pick is *still* a lost trade. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a failure, but yes you still lost the trade.   You didn‚Äôt trade the pick at the right price, that‚Äôs my point. Luka is once in a generation type player, his value right now is way above Reddish, Trae, and a first rounder"
"I mean the team is WAY better, but I do think that part of the trade was acknowledging that they were both high upside, championship caliber guys so it looks pretty savvy to get Trae + Reddish. I know he‚Äôs not playing now but recognising that your star guy has some flaws and grabbing a perfect complements to those flaws (in Cam with that pick but also Hunter) was super smart.  Watching KP fail to box guys half his size out and then watching Capela own the glass makes me not want to compare them though. It‚Äôs too early in their careers and they‚Äôre in such different situations.  That said ‚Äúmore palatable‚Äù is an understatement. Schlenk looks great right now. He saw a guy he could build an elite team around and now that team has arrived, probably ahead of schedule."
"Hawks fans are happy with Trae and Mavs fans are happy with Luka. That Cam Reddish pick has been a huge bust though. Herro, Cam Johnson and PJ Washington were the next 3 picks and all would have been better selections."
&gt;Save   &gt;   &gt;1 more reply  Fingers crossed Cam Reddish starts ballin out
Pretty good coach. Always had bad injury luck in the postseason until now (and even then De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish are out).
Lmao hunter gets the same injury and they rule him out but keep embiid going even though it could lead to an acl tear  This is such a dumbass comment cause you explained it right there that he‚Äôs playing through an injury but not all meniscus tears are the same there‚Äôs like 6 different meniscus tears I think  Y‚Äôall got cam reddish sitting for months at 21 cause his heel is sore but talk shit like this lmao
"Yeah he also campaigned against Trae's foul drawing behind his back saying he hated it. Even if it's true it's bad obviously from a chemistry standpoint with your star player but also it impacts your ability to win games which should be your goal.   On top of that he was reportedly hard to approach by players and was unreasonably hard on Cam Reddish which might have contributed to his poor season preinjury. Reddish was actually better than Hunter last year.   Overall Pierce comes across like an egomaniac who cared about how the rest of the league viewed him rather than his own team.  Most coaches when they get fired it's like yeah they're disappointing, or maybe they don't fit the FO philosophy, or it's wrong place wrong time, so I never really have hard feelings but with Lloyd Pierce I almost want him to never have a job again. He's young so he might turn it around like a lot of other coaches do but it's just hard to shake how negative he was to a young roster, and it's not like he was ""right"" to justify such methods.  Like it's telling when Vince Carter as an announcer or legit end of bench players like Nathan Knight are talking about how the difference between McMillan and Pierce is night and day."
"We would have still been a lottery team, but being where we were the past 2 seasons only *slightly* better would have likely meant no DeAndre Hunter, no Cam Reddish, no Onyeka Okongwu, and probably no Clint Capela since that deal hinged on our draft capital."
I still remember people overhyping Cam Reddish because of that one interview with Anthony Edwards and a bunch of other players about Cam in AAU ball. Has he even played this series?
They gonna unleash Cam Reddish or what?
"I‚Äôm looking at Darius Garland in Cleveland. I think along with Michael Porter, people sleep on them because of their injuries. Porter has broke out a bit and I expect Garland to be the next one.  I‚Äôm also looking at Cam Reddish to breakthrough in Atlanta. He has all the talent and has improved each year"
Throw in Cam Reddish and you got a deal!
"I mean Cam Reddish and Brandon Goodwin haven‚Äôt played in months, it‚Äôs really ‚ÄúEmbiid is the same, Hunter‚Äôs done for the year, Harris is good to go.‚Äù"
Cam Reddish being injured is a net positive
Sixers if Cam Reddish comes back and plays like 2019 Playoff Kawhi
Cam Reddish
"I‚Äôm not saying we‚Äôre a real contender, but we‚Äôre better than people think, and the team is still super young. So you‚Äôre gonna get games were everybody plays to their potential and we dominate for a stretch at least and we‚Äôre never really out of the game. We‚Äôre playing without Deandre Hunter and Cam Reddish right now as well, and game 1 was our first game without Deandre Hunter and sixers had to gameplan like he would be out there which is why they started off with Danny Green on Trae."
"Start Gallinari and bring Embiid out of the paint.  Mix up the looks Embiid sees. If you bring a double on one possession, on the next possession try something else. Make him think about what he needs to do on that possession. He has become so comfortable passing out of the double that if you bring that type of look every type he has the ball, you‚Äôre giving up an open look somewhere or you‚Äôre hoping for a clean rotation.   Hope that Cam Reddish can give you some solid minutes off the bench even though he is coming back from injury."
Trust me if we hade DeAndre hunter and Cam Reddish we would never see that man on the court unless it's a blowout.
Same. His knees did him dirty this year but it happens. Cam reddish might comeback next game so you might see something new on Sunday or Monday. Beats watching Solomon hill stand around most of the game and foul somebody
"Philly too much for hawks.   Hawks missing Cam and more importantly Hunter.  Hunter would‚Äôve been able to really harass tobias who‚Äôs been pretty much getting what he wanted. And also provide some shot making.  I think next season, with the expected growth of trae, reddish, hunter, and the lack of development by Ben the hawks will be favored over Philly."
Hawks put a trade kicker in his contract that would have fucked the Kings if they tried to match &amp; trade him elsewhere. Obviously the Hawks have no interest in trading Bogi and he should be the starting SG/splitting with Cam Reddish maybe for the rest of his contract.
I think Cam Reddish still has a chance to play.
"Imagine how much better the Hawks would be with Cam Reddish and DeAndre Hunter.  Both are 6'8"" two-way stars.  Most don't know this but Bogi started the yr on the bench.  The Hawks are two starters down and still made it to the 2nd rd."
Cam Reddish can not shoot a basketball to  save his life but I can see Deandre being that guy for us. Sucks to not have him in these games.
For sure. You‚Äôll be a top contender without a doubt. Cam Reddish or Deandre Hunter blowing up to be stars could be in the horizon.
When we get Deandre Hunter and cam reddish üòà
Hawks fans what‚Äôs going on with cam reddish health wise ?
Bahhgawd that's Cam Reddish music
"Let cam reddish 1v1 each player on the nets. He won‚Äôt score a point, but they won‚Äôt score more than 5"
"I though Cam Reddish was going to take the leap DeAndre Hunter did this year. He was trending up before the shutdown happened, then there was the article about the team doing some scrims with KD and some other players where they said Reddish was the most impressive player out there. Then this season he comes out shooting horrendously and then is sidelined indefinitely for ‚ÄúAchilles soreness‚Äù  Hindsight it makes sense that his best games were against the nets after reading that article lol but he needs to make that type of play translate to the other 29 teams in the league"
unless Cam Reddish becomes like a perennial all star I can‚Äôt see how you would think you won the trade
We gave up the pick that became Cam Reddish to get Luka. I think we easily won the trade with the Hawks.   We lost the KP trade though.
I mean that ‚Äúimportant asset‚Äù is Cam Reddish and he‚Äôs not contributing right now idk how that‚Äôs really an argument you can make. Capela and Bogdanovic are the moves that turned the franchise around more than anything.
"This is some revisionist history not to mention you are equating luck with front office strategy. The Mavs did tank in the Luka draft and got unlucky getting the 5th pick when they had the 3rd best odds. That cost them their 2019 pick to get Luka. Not that I give a shit about having Cam Reddish on the roster, but they had the same odds as the Pels at getting Zion."
His own coach was telling other coaches no to vote for Trae. So glad that Lloyd Pierce got showed the door. His treatment of Trae may have been part of the reason for the dismissal but it seems that he treated Cam Reddish even worse.
"Cam Reddish is coming back eventually though if we play long enough, he‚Äôs at the end of his recovery time."
"Hawks FO sabotaged the he'll out of the team in Trae's sophomore year to make sure they could get more help on the right timeline. You moved decent players like Tauren Prince for a pick, let go of useful vets like Len and Dedmon who was really good in Trae's first season and rolled out guys like Chandler Parsons, Jabari Parker, Evan Turner, Jeff Teague and the corpse of Vince Carter and that landed you Deandre Hunter who's a perfect fit and on the right timeline. Okwongu was also a result of it this season even if he's a work in progress. Patience and cap space meant you got Clint Capela for pennies, the Trae trade got you Cam Reddish and all those salary dumps absorbed gave you space for the offseason signings. There's intentionality and patience in the Hawks strategy even if there's been one or two misses along the way even if it looks like luck from the outside."
I would hope that Cam Reddish could come back should both teams advance to the ECF. He's the only one I'd want to even look in Harden's direction. We have nobody else.
Trae Young and Cam Reddish/s
"That was a joke. Similar to this joke:  ""Hawks without Cam Reddish"""
Non-Hawks fans are completely forgetting about Cam Reddish
"And they still took that L lmao, deandre hunter and cam reddish didn‚Äôt play game 1 and both could be back by game 2-3"
Hawks without Cam Reddish. Can you edit that into your post please?
Cam Reddish.
"Just curious, is Cam Reddish any good?"
Vince Carter was teammates with both Dell Curry and Cam Reddish. teammates with Charles Oakley and Kevin Willis too.
Hawks were also without DeAndre Hunter this game. He's the Hawks go-to defender and can drop 15+ easily in a game if he's hot. Cam Reddish is also an above average defender. He has been participating in full practice and 5v5 live scrimmages.
Yeah Cam Reddish
Is Cam Reddish out for the season?
deandre hunter and cam reddish both hurt
I miss the years of Trae slicing and dicing defenses and throwing out to wide open guys and throwing up air balls.  Half the team from LAST YEAR aren't even in the league anymore and Deandre and Cam Reddish were rooks.  Capela was injured and OO wasn't drafted.  What a difference a yr makes.
Hawks also got Cam Reddish.  Need to factor than in too!
"Cam Reddish, also of the Luca Doncic trade for those of you only comparing trae and Luca straight up"
Cam reddish did that move but he was 6‚Äô8/9 in college lol so ur point still stands
Cam Reddish?
giving up 2 bench players + cam reddish for a borderline all-star starter is not getting scammed
Lol that‚Äôs not how you motivate a player. Also Cam Reddish had an awful relationship with LP he was accused of bullying. And he lost the locker room really quickly.
"Cam Reddish said he felt like he was getting bullied by Lp, like I've never heard a young player say that about their coach before. Lp must've lost the locker room real bad"
Anthony Edwards and Cam Reddish
"Our two sophomores Hunter and Reddish are are primary/best wing defenders but unfortunately both of them were injured for over half the season, cam is still out and probably wont be back until next season. Jc also defends on the perimeter and can be good but also is a bit prone to mistakes, def improving though but not as good as the other two. Bogi and Kev also obviously play out there and kev has actually been looking pretty good but still not on the level of hunter or cam. Solo and Snell are used situationally/as needed. I think I remember that sixers game and if I do it was in that period of time where we had like 60% of our team injured but obviously yall were also dealing w injuries. I hope Embiid is healthy for this series and that we can make it competitive but both teams fully healthy I expect yall to win"
What ever happened to Cam Reddish?
"I was playing ball last night with some buddies and brought up if Cam Reddish can become like a top 75 player, that draft day trade might start to favour Atlanta. Obviously if I have to take Trae or Luka, I'm taking Luka, but I honestly believe Luka is a better individual player but Trae brings out the best versions of the majority of his teammates."
Deandre Hunter was looking like that partner till he got injured. Cam Reddish could also be a partner if his offense catches up to his defense.
"The Hunter &amp; Reddish teases of taking the big step forward have been absurd, they both have shown the legit flashes then injuries.   I've been so excited about how Hunter has come back late this season. His defense is always absurd and you can see his offense getting way more comfortable each game he plays.   If Cam can get a real full season under his belt I really think he can do the same, he's so young."
Plus we got Cam Reddish ü§û
"Yeah he‚Äôs amazing. I think hawks have been saying like ‚Äúwe KNOW Trae is a defensive liability but look at our players, weve drafted and traded FOR Trae‚Äù and we‚Äôve seen that pay off. Like if Cam reddish actually shows up after the off season we‚Äôre really almost there to having a real contender"
I wanna see RJ succeed because I want him Zion and Cam Reddish to ball out.
"The Hawks didn't skip him, they technically drafted him and traded and got Cam Reddish also"
Rui Hachimura or cam reddish are my picks
Cam Reddish  Malik Monk  ‚Ä¶..kuzma
Keldon Johnson  Kevin Porter Jr  Cam Reddish
"https://www.nbadraft.net/2018-nba-draft-combine-measurements/   https://www.nbadraft.net/2019-nba-draft-combine-measurements/  Oh wow, look at all those percentages in the 4-6% range from the 2018 NBA COMBINE.  Oh, and the 2019 Combine.  Wow.  Bruce Brown 3.75  Grayson Allen 5.5  Kostas Antetok~~~ 5.0  Shai Gilchrist Alexander - 3.0  Landry Shamat 4.8  Nic Claxton 4.5  Cam Reddish 4.7  &gt;**Tako Fall 6.8**  Trae Young 5.4"
"&gt; You guys   I'm a Celtics fan.   &gt;I thought it wasn‚Äôt teammates so much as the head coach?  The Hawks 2nd best player was Jabari Parker through John Collins' suspension lol. Cam Reddish shot 38%, Deandre Hunter 41%, Vince Carter was playing legit minutes for them, etc.   Their team was awful last year, legit contender for worst in the league, and easily worst in the league for the 25 games Collins was suspended."
"Trae Young, John Collins, Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish and 7 firsts"
"You're dumb bro. They made a deal with Dallas to get their 2 first round picks for trading the 3rd overall pick. So instead of drafting Trae 3rd overall, they drafted Luka and traded him to Dallas for the 5th overall pick and they used the other pick to get Cam Reddish. So the Hawks got 2 good players for simply dropping 2 spots in the draft"
Cam Reddish üò§
"I'm a long time Cavs fan but even I know that Garland has no way to be a top 2 player in that draft. How do you expect a slight, averagely-athletic undersized PG to be better than a 6'7"" prime Shaq-like player or a taller/lankier prime-DRose-like player in Ja? Like Chris Paul is an outlier but usually the rule is players with Garland's body type cant be a superstar in a league with the Giannis, AD's, SGA, PG, Doncic of the world.    Not only that but arguably not only with those two shining above the rest but some of the player pool of the likes of RJ, De'Andre, Reddish, Cam Johnson and especially Tyler Herro are likely to outshine DG because he can't do some of the things the bigger guys can do. But hey the Cavs could have drafted worse, so DG will be key in the rebuild."
"‚ÄúCam Reddish was among those, sources said, who also had an issue with Pierce‚Äôs coaching,‚Äù wrote Chris Kirschner, Sam Amick and David Aldridge of¬†The Athletic. ‚ÄúSources said Reddish felt like he was being ‚Äòpicked on‚Äô behind the scenes when it came to mistakes the second-year player made. There are a few players on the Hawks‚Äô roster who feel like Reddish‚Äôs potential is higher than anyone on the roster but that Pierce‚Äôs input was stunting his development.‚Äù"
"gotchu fam [https://theathletic.com/2421465/2021/03/02/behind-the-scenes-failed-lloyd-pierce-era-why-atlanta-hawks-eager-for-new-voice/](https://theathletic.com/2421465/2021/03/02/behind-the-scenes-failed-lloyd-pierce-era-why-atlanta-hawks-eager-for-new-voice/)  tl;dr Lloyd Pierce negged the entire team into sucking ass. He's a ""player's coach"" that bullied Cam Reddish and consistently played down Trae Young both in person and in public. I've personally experienced this type of ""coaching"" before and unless you're all psycho Kobe types it's absolute pure cancer. It's baffling he's on team USA and in a just world anything less than a gold would send this clown down to AAU"
He also bullied Cam Reddish
"The hawks went from the worst 4th quarter team in the league to the best in point differential and went from high in the lottery to the best record since Nate McMillan got hired. Plus apparently Pierce was an asshole and all the players on the team hated him, Cam reddish cane out and said it was good to have a coach that actually supported him (talking about Nate) and there‚Äôs an article also talking about how Pierce lobbied for Trae not to be on the all star team because he didn‚Äôt deserve it"
Cam Reddish was a bad college player who turned into a bad rookie and then a bad sophomore. Pattern recognition my man
"You‚Äôll note I didn‚Äôt comment on Langford at all because I don‚Äôt know him as a player particularly well. I‚Äôm pointing out that the commenter I‚Äôm replying to using Cam‚Äôs regular season games this season as representative of his ability as a player is silly. They mention the team being 10-16 with Cam playing, and 31-15 without him, not mentioning that that is the same stretch where the hawks in general were shitting the bed, specifically the stretch to start the season where we were still being coached by Lloyd Pierce.  I don‚Äôt really know Romeo, but to say Cam Reddish isn‚Äôt a solid rotational player is silly and stinks of someone who doesn‚Äôt actually pay much attention to the hawks"
"Actually you are wrong about high school, and you dont recall correctly, but I digress. Its true shooting isn't why he was drafted in the lottery to begin with, it was his defensive capability that was so touted. The hope was that he could eventually learn more offensive skills a la kawhi or Paul george. Again, going back to the playoffs, hawks don't dominate the bucks as soundly as they did game 4 if not for cam reddish leading the charge off the bench, and haeks probably get blown out by 30 if not for cam reddish dropping 21  The fact he shot as well as he did may end up being a flash in the pan sure, but this guy is going into his 3rd season next year. He has a ton of time to improve, and he performed at the highest level where it matters most. What the fuck has Romeo Langford done in the NBA that even compares to reddish?  I'm not even a hawks fan and I can see reddish has a future in this league while langford could be out as soon as his contract expires. I'm beginning to think its just pride making you sustain this argument that.cam reddish is shit when he clearly isnt"
"&gt; This isnt really the luka for trae young and cam reddish where reddish is showing signs of being a solid rotation player  Really? I'd make that exact comparison because Reddish has been terrible and was literally helping ruin their season before he got injured. They went 10-16 with Reddish and 31-15 without him, and that's not a coincidence with how bad his offense is."
agreed. cant really call it a steal when essentially so far the trade was a 1 for 1 trade where both teams got the guy they want. This isnt really the luka for trae young and cam reddish where reddish is showing signs of being a solid rotation player
Philadelphia:  Kyle Lowry - Cam Reddish - DeAndre Hunter Morris twins
"It depends on who the Cam Reddish is in this scenario. If you‚Äôre trading down, ideally you‚Äôre getting at least *two* serviceable players right?"
"Thing is: If you trade back, feasibly you get two bites at the apple instead of one and the possibility arises where you can get two impact guys.  Like ""we missed Lebron"" there's not even a Lebron in every draft. And if you get a Lebron, with no one else you're just stuck in the middle suddenly.  i get the risk involved but I don't understand why Detroit stays at 1 if they get someone else's pick atop theirs. Go get a ""lesser liked"" prospect and then get after it again, you might get better faster. Idk, I could be wrong. Cade could be ""generational.""  Like Atlanta turned Doncic into Trae Young and Cam Reddish. If Cam Reddish is a good, starter quality guy that means they got exceeded the value to Doncic, even if he's an MVP guy. Most would generally want two high level guys to 1."
A lot of people saying Cam Reddish but I swear it‚Äôs gonna be Deandre Hunter.   Fall off: Julius Randle
"Breakout: Nicolas Claxton, Cam Reddish, Darius Garland(if they trade Sexton)  Fall off: Julius Randle, Lebron(injuries and old age are piling on him) and Klay Thompson(if his injuries zap his full star power)"
Breakout: Cam Reddish  Fall off: Ben Simmons  @me. I'll fuck with it
"Yeah? Pretty easily honestly lol. The Hawks under McMillan were on a top 3 record pace in the East. That was without Cam Reddish or DeAndre Hunter and with some of the worst injury luck in the NBA.   If they are a top 3 seed in the East with Trae as the lone All-Star on the team, I dunno how he isn't above at least a handful of those guys."
Cam reddish
Cam reddish
I'm going to say Cam Reddish under McMillian. He'll take on a more of a lead role in the 2nd unit. He showed flashes of him breaking out for next season. Confident Cam Reddish is going to be a big trouble for the rest of NBA.
Cam reddish
Anthony Edwards and Cam Reddish
!remindme 1 year  Cam reddish is not that good
They are. This goof just wants to talk about Cam Reddish
I feel like you added on Reddish.   People are saying they shouldn‚Äôt max Collins because it will handicap them going forward. Not specifically to save Cam reddish lol
"Cam Reddish shot 2/8 in that game and they lost by one point, that's how  Turns out the team wasn't that stacked because Reddish was not that good"
"Pretty much what Dallas did to get Luka. Obviously it worked for both sides, but if Atlanta is confident that Luka is gonna be a star is the pick that turns into Cam Reddish worth it?  Cade is gonna be a stud. Everyone else has a big question mark and I'm not sure that a pick that is likely to be in the 6-12 range is worth the risk. But I'd make a shit GM so don't listen to me."
"Cam Reddish will be a solid 3 and D wing with elite defense, he could be Mikal Bridges or Paul George 2.0."
"Cam Payne isnt gonna be as good in a starting role, he is the Suns' 2018 Terry Rozier.  Collins, Huerter, Okongwu and Cam Reddish are all players I didnt even mention.  Jalen Smith? The guy who cant even get minutes over Kaminsky? Lol"
"Close but I would say Suns currently. Booker/Ayton/Bridges is stacked. I‚Äôm a huge fan of De‚ÄôAndre Hunter, however, so I might switch answers if Cam Reddish looks like a stud (I haven‚Äôt seen enough of him to know)"
"Yeah it's kind of similar to Devin Booker coming into the draft with how people were too focused on the fact that they weren't lengthy superathletes like other wings in their draft (Justise Winslow, Cam Reddish) to the point where they underrated their athleticism and shooting talent. So a lot of credit to the Suns for recognizing that."
Cam Reddish in a year
"But he isnt worth as much as OO or Cam Reddish. But yes, super homer take you're right. I like the team we have rn I see no reason to trade the guys we drafted and have been developing, right at this moment. I acknowledge JB could potentially put us over the hump. I still wanna see what's up with our boys and I wanna see em succeed in ATL with us, since we been building via the draft"
"Apparently Cam Reddish is now 6'10"" without any evidence whatsoever and I don't believe it at all"
&gt; Jaylen Brown for Cam Reddish and Onyeka Okongwu and the **hawks** say no
"Atlanta says no, even though I'd love for Jaylen to come home. OO is our center of the future as we probably will not retain Capela past his contract expiry &amp; the entire org is very very high on Cam Reddish, and Cam is the perfect fit next to Trae while we can be more flexible with our contracts as well.  OO just played a key role in our ECF run as a rookie, I'd be downright shocked at this.  Someone said Hunter and Hawks absolutely say no, hes our 4 if JC ever leaves and also looking like our future 2nd scorer. He shut down Randle and scored many important buckets in a ton of different ways for us."
"I really think we could challenge the Nets if we‚Äôre healthy too. I know it‚Äôs regular season, but all 3 of our games with the Nets this year went down to the wire. KD and Kyrie played all 3 while Harden missed 2, but we were banged up too and still had Pierce coaching all 3 of those games.   Also Cam always goes off against the Nets for some reason, like he‚Äôs Middleton against the Celtics or something. It‚Äôs crazy that we went this far in the playoffs with our 2 best wings missing significant time, Bogi playing hobbled, and eventually falling out only once our superstar got injured.   Our defense should be much improved next year given that Hunter, Reddish, and even Dunn are expected to be healthy going into the season. That‚Äôs not to mention growth from our young guys, especially Okongwu."
"And just imagine if Cam Reddish (who was also part of that trade) blossoms into the star that we all know he can be. Due to unfortunate injuries, covid season, etc. we haven‚Äôt seen it yet but the potential is there. In game 6, Cam Reddish joined only Kobe Bryant as players 22 years old or younger to make 6+ 3 pointers in a conference final game. This was only Reddish‚Äôs 3rd game back from injury which sidelined him since February. Not saying ATL won the trade, because it‚Äôs so early in their careers but I‚Äôm just saying.. This hawks team is dangerous and is not going away anytime soon. And then you got Hunter, and even OO too but that‚Äôs for another conversation."
"There were reports from unnamed sources (of course) that he was particularly rough and perhaps confidence shattering on Cam Reddish, asked other coaches around the league not to vote for Trae to be an all-star this year, and calling Collins a selfish player.  The actual evidence was in the post game pressers after we blew a bunch of games in the fourth quarter and he almost never took any responsibility for the collapses. ""The players didn't execute"" was a common LP phrase."
They should be able to keep this core for another year at least. John Collins is a RFA so if we don't come to an agreement to a contract here and he finds a contract elsewhere we'll have to match it.   After Trae gets his Max tho then it'll get interesting.   Kevin Heurter will get between $15-20 mil a year. While he has been great in the playoffs his regular season numbers are okay not all star-esque so I think we can sign him to a Bogi style deal.   Cam reddish and DeAndre Hunter are in the same boat as well. They haven't had a crazy season to warrant a max.   Only guy who warrants a max is Trae......maybe John Collins.   The evolution of Onyeka Okungwu will determine what happens to JC or Clint.   Tbh we need bulkier PF/C so I hope Onyeka Okungwu grows and bulks up.
I can see Cam Reddish or Deandre Hunter being all stars before CC or JC
They‚Äôre hella scary. Cam reddish is taking a leap next year and Hunter is gonna improve and continue to be a problem. The top 5 teams in the east next season is hella stacked.
Cam Reddish does the same thing they just don't call fouls on him for some reason
Zion Williamson - 28/10 on 62/30/72 shooting  DeAndre Hunter - 15/4 on 45/35/85  RJ Barrett - 18/6/4 on 45/37/77  Ja Morant - 21/4/8 on 43/32/74  Mikal Bridges - 13/5 on 50/40/85  Cam Reddish - 10/5 on 38/31/80  Kevin Porter Jr. - 18/3/7 on 41/30/76  Anthony Edwards - 22/4/4 on 43/35/80  LaMelo Ball - 16/7/8 on 44/37/78  James Wiseman - 14/9 on 55/33/70  Patrick Williams - 11/6 on 46/37/72  Onyeka Okongwu - 7/7 on 60/-/60  Tyrese Halliburton - 14/4/6 on 45/40/85  Killian Hayes - 11/3/6 on 37/34/80
Zion: 29/8/5  Hunter: 18/6/2  RJ Barett: 19/7/4  Ja Morant: 24/3/10  I don't feel like doing the rest  Edit: Cam Reddish will win MIP
i don't believe you about Cam Reddish everyone was shitting on him before the year.  Herro sure i bet that happened but yeah i'm gonna doubt the reddish thing was a wide spread opinion.
i looked up ‚Äúrj barrett or cam reddish‚Äù threads and every single one has majority people taking rj cam was never a consensus lol
"Cam Reddish is not good, he's like a Presti wing who can't shoot  1. Barrett  2. Herro  3. Reddish"
"1. Mikal Bridges 2. KJ 3. Hunter\* 4. Cam Reddish  &gt;Who might have the highest ceiling  I think Hunter and Reddish both have the highest, although Hunter may become something special man. I'm still not convinced Bridges or Johnson cannot add more parts to their game to become more fully rounded."
Bridges Keldon Hunter Reddish. Cam could easily move up next year he really balled out in the games he played last two weeks
Cam Reddish - Paul George   DeAndre Hunter - Kawhi Leonard lite  Michael Porter Jr - Brandon Ingram  Patrick Williams - Jimmy Butler  Onyeka Okongwu - Lanky Serge Ibaka  RJ Barrett - Danny Granger  Kevin Porter Jr - Dollar Store Harden
Cam Reddish
"Trae Young (22), Kevin Huerter (22), Cam Reddish (21), DeAndre Hunter (23),   John Collins (23), Onyeka Okongwu (20).  Got to be up there for best young cores in the league, especially with how they've almost all proven themselves in these playoffs."
"Cam Reddish was a legendary high school prospect, and if he didn't have to go to college probably would've been the #1 overall pick. Everyone who played with or against him in high school spoke of him with what I can only describe as awe and reverence.  Then he got to Duke and Coach K jammed him into a system that just didn't work, and it shattered his confidence being the first time he didn't easily succeed on the court.  Then he got drafted by Atlanta, and Lloyd Pierce treated him like shit (not in particular, he just treated everyone like shit).  These handful of games under Nate McMillan were, IMO, the first real glance at the type of player Cam can be.  None of us are joking when we say his ceiling is league MVP."
For Trae Young and Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish
"&gt; John Collins suspended for 25 games   &gt; Cam Reddish, one of the worst players in the league last season, averaged 27 MPG    &gt; Team improves immensely when Young plays and actually had a respectable offence   ""Trae Young is an empty stats player!!!""  I can't believe some people were stupid enough to watch him put up 30 PPG/9 APG on 60% TS and claim he wasn't good lmao."
And the correct answer for ATL was apparently to feed Cam fucking Reddish
"Reggie Jackson, Cam Reddish, and John Collins are the only ones who ""raised their stock""  The rest of those guys were gonna end up getting max contracts anyway if they want"
"Reddish went off in the bucks series but capela and collins were our core pieces all season, even when cam was healthy. If you mean young and controlled, I agree completely"
Cam Reddish gives me Joe Johnson vibes
Cam reddish is Kobe DeAndre Hunter is kawhi and onyeka okongwu is obviously shaq. No bias at all
"So was Lonzo, so was Blake Griffin but both of them really got better at shooting three's.  At 21, he can drastically improve.  Don't forget this was his first games under Nate, the entire team did horribly with Pierce.  Oh yeah, Russell Westbrook is 32 and again, Cam Reddish is 21 but you can believe what you want to."
Cam Payne Cam Reddish
"The Hawks also received a draft pick which they used to draft Cam Reddish. However, it's still too early to decide who won this trade."
Good young players and Cam Reddish.
Cam Reddish played great D on him and stuck on him like glue. He still drew a foul though and got to the line
"As a kawhi fan, happy they made it so far and that PG showed up to the level that he did. But I‚Äôm salty as hell knowing that the clippers missing the best playoff performer in years and 2 starters and even with all that took who is most likely going to win it all to 6 games.   No offense to suns or bucks fans, but I sure as hell think the suns lose in 4-5 if kawhi is healthy and maybe 6 for the bucks, Giannis is great but Middleton just got outplayed by cam reddish the bucks don‚Äôt scare me"
"Trae, Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish &gt; JC and Huerter lmao"
I know cam reddish was good last night but them no longer having to play what was one of the worst starters in the nba 30 min a night once he got hurt was a big part of why that team took off if were being blunt

"They played a Hawks team without Trae Young and the 2nd best player DeAndre Hunter.  Cam Reddish wasn't fully back, Capela was hurt, etc.  The Bucks were fully healthy with the exception of Giannis and Donte, but Donte isn't a starter."
Give credit to Cam Reddish for that.
"CAM REDDISH, BE READY FOR HIM NEXT YEAR !"
Well there is future 4x MVP Cam Reddish.
"Watch Cam Reddish become their best player. Such a deep group.  Trae, Huerter, Cam, Hunter, Okongwu as the starters going forward. With Bogdan and Collins off the bench. All so young with so much potential."
"Congrats Bucks, good luck in the Finals!  Couple thoughts:  What is the point of the Conference Champions gear (shirts etc.)? Unless you win the title nobody gives a damn about just winning your conference.  Why did Atlanta stop feeding Cam Reddish down the stretch? That was still a very winnable game and they threw it away by Trae trying to play hero ball while being injured and gassed."
Cam Reddish and Deandre Hunter were injured too.
"That‚Äôs the future first round pick we traded with Trae for Luka, Atlanta picked Cam Reddish with it.   Basically we traded Trae and Reddish for Luka, I‚Äôd still do it knowing that.   Would do you guys do it??"
I don‚Äôt think the 0 makes is as damning as the 13 attempts here. His injury was clearly affecting his shot. He should have let some of the other guys shoot more down the stretch. Cam Reddish was 6/7 from deep and they just stopped looking for him at the end of the game.
"True. In a dream world, we're healthy, JC improves on his defense and post game, Reddish shows out next year, and we have a Trae, Cam, Hunter, JC, and Capela starting 5 with Bogi, Huerter, Lou Will, Gallo, and OO off the bench. But ig we'll have to see what happens in the offseason."
Mah boi Cam Reddish showing flashes
"Cam Reddish was going nuclear too, the Hawks should've give him more shots."
"People are going to sleep on how impressive Cam Reddish looked in this game because of Trae being hobbled and Khris going nuclear in the 3rd, but if he can bring that energy moving forward he can easily find a spot on this roster for a long time to come."
Called Cam Reddish Giannis on one of his shots
"Damn, Bucks really did it. Been a few years coming, and it's great to see them get into the finals, even if it's without Giannis.  Obviously disappointing to get 2-0'd by the Bucks without Giannis, but still an unbelievably exciting time for the Hawks. Cam Reddish popped the fuck off tonight, and Reddish+Hunter developing next year is frightening when you see what the Hawks already did this year. Not to mention further development of Okongwu/Huerter.  While players like Bogey/Galo are some of the most skilled offensive players in the world, the defensive athleticism of Hunter/Reddish/Okongwu is scary, combined with Capela as the anchor and Collins who is solid too. The Hawks are going to have so many options, assuming Hunter can stay healthy (he looked amazing before going out again) and Reddish further develops.  I don't believe in ""unofficial asterisks"" when it comes to championships. Unless there's an actual, official reason that changed the way a championship is earned, I think that shit is stupid to even talk about. Last year the bubble, this year injuries, it's still 16 teams playing bo7's after regular seasons longer than the strike season.  With that out of the way, I just want to highlight how insane the blood-soaked path is for the Suns. First round, they play the Lakers and AD gets (re)injured, Lebron not 100%. Second round, Nuggets with no Jamal Murray or Dozier, Barton still working his way back. Conference finals, Clippers without Kawhi or Ibaka, and Zubac out the last two games.  That's not like a few random injuries to decent players. That's AD/Lebron, Jamal Murray, Kawhi Leonard, and Giannis. MVP's and finals MVP's out the ass. Pretty insane.  I'm really happy that my two favorite teams to watch this year (pls come back Sonics) are into the finals. Just hoping Giannis is able to come back at some point, even if it's 3-0 and doomed. Suns have easily been my favorite this year, but I've been rooting hard for the Bucks these last couple years, so I guess I won't know who I want to win until they start playing."
"""Cam Reddish on the Bucks with the foul"""
"Yeah. I think that's what it came down to. I think if Hawks went on that fourth quarter Cam Reddish-led run against the Bucks of, like, 2018 or whenever, then they would've folded. It was a vicious run that easily could've turned the game around.  But they didn't even break a sweat. Khris and Jrue were like ""been here before"", stayed cool, and just drained bucket after bucket in response.  They've been up against some really tough teams. The Raptors, Celtics, and Heat prepared them for this moment."
"As far as I'm concerned in this moment, Cam Reddish is the second coming of Jesus Christ (of basketball)."
I think the number one thing the hawks do is give cam reddish more minutes
Cam Reddish will be the best player from that trade.
WE did it but holy shit cam reddish gave me nightmares
Cam Reddish
"Hmm?  what is with defining a prospect only around being a high level athlete?  Beyond that he actually *does* have some high level physical traits: he's 6'8"" and has a 7ft wingspan, that's almost exactly the same dimensions as cam reddish.  He should be able to play the post as he fleshed out.  That's a great profile for a modern wing.    He moves well, he seems like he *could* develop in all of shooting, ball handling, passing, and defense.  Any player who can put that together doesn't need to be some nuclear athlete to be extremely effective.   You also don't need to put everything together before you can legally drink in order to be considered a guy worth investing time and effort into developing.  You just need to flash, which he has done.  Too early to be completely out on this particular guy, doubly so considering Cade and Bey just got to town.  He's at minimum worth kicking the tires on for the life of the rookie deal, unless there's some barnburner return for him."
I don‚Äôt know why people keep forgetting the hawks were one of the most injured teams in the regular season and trae got injured against the bucks. They beat the sixers without deandre hunter and cam reddish and bogdanovic was playing poorly through a knee injury. Plus we‚Äôre a young team so I would expect hunter okongwu and some other players to make significant jumps.
"Vince being teammates with Kevin Willis (born 1963) and Charles Oakley (born 1964) in his rookie year, then Trae Young and Cam Reddish in his final year (Reddish was born after Vince's rookie year) is pretty amazing."
Cam Reddish
It‚Äôs hard to say last year was a fluke with how injured the Hawks were in the the playoffs.  We don‚Äôt even know how good they are because we haven‚Äôt seen them healthy.  Ever.  Starting line up played 5 games together all of last season.  Cam Reddish and Deandre Hunter haven‚Äôt played together since January.   If the Hawks were healthy there is no way the 76ers series goes 7 games.
"If we are playing the injury card, Trae had a hurt shoulder and no Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish, and Bogi was on one knee shooting 5 - 17 every game. We had to start Solomon Hill‚Ä¶."
"Prolly Cam Reddish, but the Hawks have like 8 role players the subreddit fuckin loves it's amazing.  Huerter, Reddish, Sharife Cooper are probably the most loved rn."
Tacko Fall almost beat that Duke team with Zion RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish though.
"I despise Coach K, but this is a bad take.  Anybody can lose in a single tournament game at any time - that's what makes March Madness arguably the most exciting event in sports.    But college Cam Reddish sucked - major disappointment."
"Coach K lost in the Elite 8 with Zion, RJ Barrett, and Cam Reddish."
"Funny you mention Brandon Roy when  another international bust was drafted before Roy and the year before that Bogut was draft and that's another international player undeserving of a high pick based off nothing but projection instead of a combo of projection and results. When you're drafting a player it should be off of projection and skill but also how are they performing in front of the best comp. Cam Reddish had all the talent at Duke, but he shot like shit in College but was still drafted high. Guess what? He still shoots like shit."
Can the kings get 1 cam reddish pls? Well give you a slightly used but expiring contract in marvin bagley
Cam Reddish was snubbed smh he asked not to play
"If you were an owner, you would be Cam Reddish"
pretty sure Cam Reddish is 7'0 by now.
If I was owner with flexibility I would go for Cam Reddish..If I was owner with minimal flexibility I would go for Cam Reddish.
If I'm any team in the league I'm trying to get cam reddish asap. Dude showed tons of promise in the playoffs
Cam Reddish is already the goat imo. Mavs/Hawks trade? The Hawks would've won that without Trae  /s
&gt;Coby and Cam have both shown flashes of being a star.   Is that why your FO is actively shopping Reddish? and ask Bulls fans what they think of Coby lol.
Culver was mocked in the top 10 so it wasn't a reach also Cam Reddish and Coby White are 2 very broken players also. We need players who can contribute now not project picks.
"You could‚Äôve had someone like Cam Reddish, Coby White, Keldon Johnson or Kevin Porter Jr and went with Culver thats hilarious LMFAO"
One Cam Reddish please!
think with cam reddish it's more a sell high type of thing. They can't pay everyone. Got the problem that the nuggets had where they just drafted too good and can't keep everyone
"Got lucky with injuries? What are you talking about? We were missing DeAndre Hunter for the entire postseason after the first series, Cam Reddish didn‚Äôt play until the ECF, Bogdanovic was clearly hurt from the second round onward, and Trae got hurt in the ECF. Sixers were only missing Danny Green and the Bucks didn‚Äôt lose Giannis until after Trae had already gone down. We made it to the ECF despite our injuries, not because of injuries on other teams"
Future mvp cam reddish???
Cam Reddish? The untouchable trade asset whom they couldnt even get Indiana to swap 13 for 20 with?  Somebody should trade for Thad Young who was the leagues best player to be eligible for 6MOTY last yr. Kyle Anderson would also be a good get Memphis aint serious about looking to win. TJ Warren good buy low if he can be had for a reasonable price.
Didn't realize.   Some rookies do skip summer league at times. Like I didn't DeAndre Hunter or Cam Reddish in the Hawks summer their rookie year. I dunno if both were injured or what.    I did get to see Jalen Johnson and Sharife Cooper ballin out this summer league tho
"I learned cursive and I only use it for my signature these days, but that alone is worth it. You see tons of basketball players who sign initials (or you could be Cam Reddish and sign a single diagonal line and call it an autograph)"
"If you gotta pay premium for both, who would you rather have; Reddish or Huerter?  I go Cam. I think he can unlock the true potential of the Hawks."
Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish
"Huerter will probably sign an extension before this season starts. Also cam and Reddish are the same person, you probably meant hunter and Reddish. Hunter will definitely get signed to one next year, but idk what Cams value is. Idk if anyone knows really.  Huerters deal would kick in after this season if he signs an extension, and then Hunter and Reddish would kick in after two seasons from now."
&gt;  both Cam and Reddish
It would but Huerter is do for a new contract next year then the following year both Cam and Reddish
&gt;Cam Reddish wants to be traded to the Lakers   FTFY
Cam Reddish.  SUPERSTARRRRRR
"I'm not even a hawks fan, but I really want to see De'Andre Hunter (I'm a uva fan) or Cam Reddish break out. Atlanta needs one of their wings to really step up if they want more playoff success, Trae can only do so much. Cam had some really nice moments in this year's playoffs, taking over some points in crucial moments. There's no reason to think he can't make that a normal thing, and if he can then he'd be on a great trajectory for top 10. The hawks core also certainly has the position clearly carved out, just someone needs to step up and fill it"
Cam Reddish.
"Cam Reddish for me. The talent is there, the consistency and health are what's next."
"It‚Äôd be interesting to see Luka still on the Hawks because I do believe they‚Äôre a better team overall. As a Hawks fan, I‚Äôm happy with Trae. I think he‚Äôs a better fit for Atlanta culturally and whatever. I could see Trae being an Atlanta Hawk for life, and I can‚Äôt say I would have felt the same with Luka. And I‚Äôm really happy to have Cam Reddish on the team, which wouldn‚Äôt have happened if Luka stayed.   Luka has way more potential on defense, you‚Äôre right. But he‚Äôs a lot lazier than Trae. It‚Äôs not even that Luka is clumsy on defense the way Trae can look, he‚Äôs just lazy on it, which I don‚Äôt know how to fix that exactly."
"Cam Reddish, ppl sleeping on him b/c he got injured this year, him and malik beasley are secret superstars."
Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish
Cam reddish I still believe in the homie
Cam Reddish
Cam reddish. He‚Äôs there defensively and he‚Äôs getting there slowly on offense. If everything comes together oh lord
Cam Reddish
cam reddish
Cam Reddish
"Yeah I mean the nature of these threads is despite what we will say the odds of any of these guys becoming actual stars nonetheless superstars are quite low. So your just looking for what possible path is there to reaching such a level and is it completely implausible. I would say probably so for being like a top 12ish player for DeJounte Murray but if I had to nominate someone for this he's a better candidate than a number of names Ive seen here like Cam Reddish or whatever. And by ""better"" candidate its like a 3% chance vs 1% or whatever.   Someone else nominated Devin Vassell on here which if you made San Antonio pick which guy would you keep the next 5-10 yrs Vassell or DeJounte that's an interesting question. I bet they might say Vassell"
Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish
"Keldon Johnson (not sure if that counts with his USA team status now), Coby White, Cam Reddish"
"This is the prove-it year for Cam.  The Hawks are incredibly deep, but they are probably going to need one more all-star level player in order to really contend.  Deandre Hunter is going to be a really steady, solid player, but he doesn‚Äôt have the limitless potential of Reddish.  If Cam takes his big leap this season, the Hawks could win a title."
Cam Reddish
"Cam Reddish , he seems unfazed by big moments and has the skillset required to make the leap. Hope he has a great career."
Kevin Porter Jr and Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish and Rui
Cam reddish. I promise
He might not be top 5 but I think cam reddish is gonna be basically like Paul George
Cam Reddish is gonna be a star in this league
MVP: Jayson Tatum  DPOY: Bam Adebayo  ROY: Cade Cunningham  6MOY: Cam Reddish  MIP: Jaren Jackson Jr  COY: Nate McMillan
Well if Cam Reddish continues playing how he played in the playoffs he has it locked in
"Statistically Garry Harris was the best last season, followed by cam reddish. (Sorting by percentile) the stats are posted below   https://www.nba.com/stats/players/cut/?sort=PERCENTILE&amp;dir=1"
I thought reddish was the better one ? Cam looks like he is 6‚Äô10 jackd wing out there
He comp'd Cam Reddish and Nassir Little to Randy Moss and Rob Gronkowski Ive never seen anything like it lol
"1. The Atlanta Hawks will be the 1st seed in the NBA.  2. Cam Reddish will have a breakout year and PT is the only thing that will show if he's MIP.  3. Miami will not meet Vegas expectations but Boston will.  4. Their is a Laker who no one is chatting about outside of LA fans who will breakout and help LA become the #1 seed in the West. 5. Utah will be back, watch out LA. Same for PHX, watch out LA. 6. There is a Laker who no one is chatting about outside of LA fans who will breakout and help LA become the #1 seed in the West. 7. One of these teams will do better than expected: (Orl, Det, Hou, Okc, Cle) 8. Okc and Hou will stink in 2021-22 but in 22-23, one of them will be play in teams and vastly improve.  9. Don't sleep on the Knicks. They might not be an eye candy team but they gel well and they get more out of their players than most will get out of their players. Kemba/Rose mix will really help the two PGs as well as McBride playing a key role as well.  10. My top 10 breakout kids are in no order: O. Toppin, C. Reddish, A. Edwards, L. Ball, Tre Jones, T. Maxey, I. Quickley, Rui, and K. Johnson. 11. The Spurs surprise people and be a play-in team.  12. Players people are expecting to breakout but likely won't is: K. Kuzma, R.J. Barrett, D. Hunter, M. Robinson, J. Allen, C. Sexton, C. Anthony, B. Ingram, D. Graham, and P. Achuiwa.  13. I have no clue who will win it all, it will come down to luck and health. If healthy, the Lakers should win it all but easier said than done."
PG: Kemba ($10)  SG: NAW ($3)  SF: KD ($42)  PF: Giannis ($40)  C: Brooke Lopez ($16)  BENCH  Lou Will ($3)  Cam Reddish ($4)  Boogie Cousins ($2)
It‚Äôs not like he was the main drivee of that success. Would you say Cam Reddish was more successful than RJ?
Those raptors teams lacked a game changer at wing our roster has potentially two of those in deandre Hunter and cam reddish esp Hunter he flashed great two way talent
Cam Reddish will be the best of the Duke big 3 (RJ Barret and Zion being the other two). I said this before the draft and I‚Äôm not backing down
"I coulda swore it was Cam Reddish who y'all got with our #10 pick, but don't worry I actually really like Trae and it was so much fun watching him play the villain role this postseason. I also really like how Trae and Luka are good friends with each other too"
It depends on how good does Cam Reddish does IMO. Luka is better than Trae by a slight gap so we need to see if Reddish is good enough to cover that gap
"I'm not disputing the fact that they had great offseasons. All of those teams got better, but so did we.   We were one of the most injured teams in the league last year. Honestly we should probably be talking about how we added De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish to our roster. Hunter played 23 games and Cam played 26. Even Bogi only played 44 games. We're also coming into the season with much better options at the backup 1 spot. Whatever positives Rondo brought to our team off the court, he was absolutely abysmal on the court. Staring the season with Sweet Lou and Delon Wright coming off the bench is a huge improvement for us.   Also, as others have pointed out we might as well be a completely different team with Nate coaching. I get that you can't just throw out our record under LP, but what we did in the playoffs proved that our regular season record under Nate wasn't some fluke."
"Cam Reddish  Romeo Langford or Aaron Nesmith (probably just one of those 2)  Darius Garland (maybe he's too good or obvious for that list)  PJ Dozier  Malik Monk  Jaren Jackson Jr. (think this is the year he turns it around)  Tyrese Maxey  Kira Lewis or Nickeil Alexander Walker (same as the Boston guys, not sure they can both breakout at the same time)  Malachi Flynn"
"He shows something once every 3 weeks and has been living off this hype since then. If he has ""good defensive instincts"" so does most of the league, he's western conference Cam Reddish its hilarious the degree to which people are still confident in his skill set and preface everything by ""If you dont believe in him or think he's good it means you dont watch him"". Portland traded up for this dude spent yrs hyping him up and developing him and had no interest in bringing him back."
"Cam Reddish could drastically improve at any moment, I firmly believe that"
did i hear you say cam reddish?
"Cam Reddish, Nassir Little, Romeo Langford are a couple from the last few years."
Cam Reddish
Reddish is Cam Bucket
We did not make big moves in the FA but we will now have a healthy DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish with a full off season to learn Nate Mcmillan's system.  Also this is a young team that just got plenty of playoff experience. So it's tough to say that we didn't get significantly better.
Bye Bye Cam Reddish tho
Each day we stray away from the path of Cam Reddish all-star.
If cam reddish becomes a borderline all star in the future I think it would be justified
Cam reddish. Gonna average 15 ppg with good shooting splits and make an all-defense team
"I have no idea... bias makes me wanna pick Caruso if he develops an even better shot? Maybe Cam Reddish. Maybe Deandre Ayton if he can improve on his handles, maybe that's most likely with him continuing to grow with Booker and CP3. Maybe DeAngelo Russell thrives with KAT and has an awesome season..."
Hawks the deepest imo  Trae Young  Lou Williams  Kevin Huerter  Bogdan Bogdonavich  Cam Reddish  DeAndre Hunter  Sharife Cooper  Danilo Gallinari  Jalen Johnson  John Collins  Onyeka Okongwu  Clint Capela
How are De‚ÄôAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish not on this list
I‚Äôm sorry but Cam Reddish has not proved anything YET to be brought up so often by Hawks fans as some difference maker. Potential is there without a doubt but he isn‚Äôt there yet
"The Hawks didn't have De'Andre Hunter or Cam Reddish at all, Trae had a shoulder injury, and Bogi had a knee injury that progressed the the point that he could barely play."
"Higher on Cam Reddish than most I think. I'll just paste a comment I made a few days ago about his FG%  &gt;I don't think it is though. He shot 46% from 2P% this year, Covington for example shot 45.1.%. Danny Green shot 43.8%.  KCP also shot 46%.   &gt;The main reaosn his FG% is so low is because his 3PT shot is in the low 30's wheras the other guys are in the 40% range, and also, he's taking 5 2PA's a game while the other guys are taking 2.   &gt;His archtype is a very switchable 6'8 wing. He just needs to shoot 3s and defend. As long as he ups his 3P% while also cutting out some of those non-3's he'll be fine. I would 100% take him on my team no questions asked. He's still big, has great lateral quickness, and is a good ball handler for his size.  Also probably higher on Poeltl. I think he legit needs to be in DPOY discussions and hope he plays 30+ mins this year.   Way lower on John Collins than most. I think his archtype no longer has any place in the NBA. Pure 4 who can't guard the perimeter or play the 5 defensively. To me these players will always be negative players no matter what their offense look like because they can't guard anybody."
I'm high on Obi Toppin. I think he is going to carve out a nice role in the NBA and having practically no offseason and then the calf injury set him back a bunch.   &amp;#x200B;  Lower on Cam Reddish than a lot seem to be. There were some hawks fans saying he's better than RJ which I just don't see.
"Guys Im lower on than the general consensus: Jaren Jackson, Cam Reddish, Brandon Ingram(to a lesser extent than the other ones he's obviously still good), Myles Turner   Guys Im higher on than the general consensus: Jonas Valanciunas, Isaiah Stewart, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Derrick White,"
"*cough* Cam Reddish *cough*   Don't get me wrong,  still can be a good player but some kids develop at different rates."
Or the fact that KD is turning 33 year and Harden is turning 32 this month.or that Kyrie can't stay healthy last two years.   Or the fact that DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish were injured for the most of the year. And obviously their growth too
"Nets Hawks Bucks 76ers Heat Bulls    That‚Äôs how I rank the top 6 in the east.  It is my opinion that if the Hawks were as healthy as the Bucks or Suns and had Cam Reddish and Deandre Hunter in the line up at the same time they would be champs.  Here‚Äôs my thinking:   - The Hawks were statistically a top 10 defense in the regular season while Cam Reddish, Deandre Hunter, and and Clint Capela were all healthy.  Then injuries happened.   - The Hawks young core was underdeveloped under a terrible coach (LP) and did not have any continuity with 1 covid shortened season and no bubble as well as no offseason program and really no pre season.   -  As soon as a good coach came to the organization the Hawks had the best record in the East from March-July as well as the best 4th quarter point differential in the East.  This all happened while facing one of the toughest second half schedules in the league and without their starting 5 starting a game together until round 1 of the playoffs.  They were I believe the 3rd most injured team during the regular season.  - With an almost full off season and pre season with a good coach, as well as the progress that you would expect hard working players under 25 to make, 3/4ths of Atlanta‚Äôs team could theoretically play better than they did last season.  I‚Äôm a Hawks fan so call me a homer if you will, but we‚Äôre in the golden age of Atlanta Hawks basketball and I‚Äôm expecting the best stretch our franchise has ever had over the next 5-10 years.  Last year was already the best team in our history and our core is all under 25."
* John Collins -23 * Kevin Huerter-22 * De'Andre Hunter-23 * Cam Reddish-21 * Trae Young-22 * Onyeka Okongwu-20 * Jalen Johnson (R)-19 * Sharife Cooper (R)-20 * Skylar Mays (2-Way)-23  Hawks have 9
Cam Reddish
"I think talent-wise the hawks did not upgrade that much compared to the other teams. It‚Äôs no disrespect, the Hawks did a fantastic job last season but other teams bolstered their rosters significantly while the hawks just kept their team intact. Sure they‚Äôll get cam reddish back but is that enough? I personally don‚Äôt think so"
"JC or Capela, Cam Reddish, could throw in Huerter or hell even Okongwu and a slew of picks I suppose."
"Hawks don‚Äôt have the pieces to make this trade, unless the Wolves are willing to accept pieces that probably are at best secondary role players (I‚Äôm sorry r/nba but no Cam Reddish will not be a superstar)"
2023-2024 Cam Reddish
yea what tf are these guys talking about üòÇ who are the hawks gonna trade for simmons? cam reddish and salary filler?
Cam Reddish is incredibly gifted athletically and is smooth on the court. He plays great on ball defense which is also adds to the eye test.  But of course his stats have been horrible. Every time he scores you‚Äôre like man he‚Äôs good. All the misses disappear
Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish or De‚ÄôAndre Hunter will win MIP
"He has to be the favorite for MIP right?  I could also see Wendell Carter, Spencer Dinwiddie, Miles Bridges, and Cam Reddish winning."
Yo can anyone tell me anything about DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen either one of them play a game after college.
"Throw in John Collins, Cam Reddish and some Frp's and I'll consider Capela"
Trae before this playoffs run. Cam reddish now
"I like to see Cam Reddish do well this year. He was okay/good during the playoffs against the Bucks.   De'Andre Hunter too, hope he gets well."
"0 quotes in the article or the ones linked from Schlenk or anyone from the Hawks org. They know just as much as we do whether they were drafting for fit or BPA. Imo if they were drafting for fit, they would‚Äôve drafted a centre instead of Cam Reddish as they didn‚Äôt have Capela then."
"Jerry West used to work for Memphis as well. He made the Gasol trade.   A few other teams have done things similar to this.   The front office guy from one place came from another situation (franchise) and is still working with that front office to help the initial franchise win.   The Spurs made a trade with The Hawks a few years ago that benefitted both, but more for The Spurs.   Recently, I thought this was going to be the case with The Hawks and Golden State. Especially when I saw Cam Reddish in the gym working out with Steph a while back. Just looked funny."
This could be fun if it‚Äôs unproven/flashes potential:   RJ Barrett/Cam Reddish/Anthony Edwards/Lamelo/Cade
"Huerter is really good too and I was gonna say Trae and Huerter but someone else already said it lol. A lot of us are really high on cam and Hunter over huerter but he‚Äôs shown a lot more improvement than cam has. What‚Äôs crazy is that of all the guys in our roster the dude with the highest ceiling is Cam reddish, when he plays great he plays amazing and has superstar potential but unfortunately he hasn‚Äôt been consistent yet. There‚Äôs a lot of Paul George and kawhi hype for cam and Hunter while huerter gets more elite role player to above avg role player comparisons"
Give it a few seasons but a fully developed Cam Reddish and Deandre Hunter would be absolutely nasty
"I like this one too, been thinking the same thing:   * They'll have a full season with McMillan, which will help them gel a bit more. Not only that, but they won 68.4% of their games with Nate last year, that's 56 win pace in a full, 82-game season.  * De'Andre Hunter will be back and healthy, people forget they were missing a starter who played like one of the best 3&amp;D wings to start the season.  * They brought back LouWill, who was a nice bench spark plug last year, drafted Sharife Cooper to give them some backup playmaking, picked up Gorgui Dieng (who's a reliable backup C) and Delon Wright (a really solid defensive guard), and they have a ton of high-potential guys like Cam Reddish/Jalen Johnson/Onkeya Okongwu who could break out."
Cam Reddish is going to be a problem too. Give him a couple years.
Cam Reddish was really good in high school though. He was a point guard in HS who could pass/defend/dribble/shoot at 6‚Äô8/6‚Äô9. Still has lots of promise imo
Cam Reddish??? What draft site was that?
RJ Barrett &amp; Cam Reddish were ranked higher than Zion on some recruiting sites LOL c'mon now.
A lot of people still dying on the hill of Cam Reddish turning into Paul George at some point.
"PG: Trae Young  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF: De‚ÄôAndre Hunter  PF: John Collins  C: Clint Capela   Reserves: Delon Wright, Kevin Huerter, Cam Reddish, Danilo Gallinari, Onyeka Okongwu."
"Reddish‚Äôs peaks have been really promising, but his consistency is a real issue. I hope that ECF Reddish is the real guy, but I just haven‚Äôt seen enough of that sort of play from him. Sometimes he makes Kawhi reads, but more often than not, Cam reminds me of Jabari Parker. He plays downhill with one move and hands of stone."
Exactly. How is cam reddish any different than the wolves just adding mcdaniels?
"&gt;You can‚Äôt trade away Ben Simmons for cam reddish and huerter lol.  You're right, the salary cap numbers don't work out"
I‚Äôm gonna high jack your comment to put forth a hot take trade proposal:  Minnesota gets: Ben Simmons  Philly gets: Cam Reddish Bogdon  Beasley 2025 first Pick swaps  ATL gets: Jaden McDaniels 2023 first  2027 first Pat Bev  Idk this actually looks bad lol
You can‚Äôt trade away Ben Simmons for cam reddish and huerter lol.   I doubt atlanta throws in hunter given that he‚Äôs their best chance at a second star for trae.
"Yeah he‚Äôs just an incomplete at this point.  As a Hawks fan, I can say it‚Äôs nice that our team isn‚Äôt COUNTING on him to break out. Team is crazy deep no matter how he does.  But the flashes we‚Äôve seen (like how he played against the Bucks in the ECF) has kept the hype train running.  We‚Äôll see if he can stay healthy.  His numbers won‚Äôt jump off the page, as long as Bogi, Huerter, and Hunter are also playing wings.  The thought of Reddish and Hunter starting at 3 and 4, playing lockdown defense and Cam slashing to the basket while Hunter does his thing as a shooter who can get his own shot‚Ä¶it‚Äôs the makings of a championship team."
"yep yep.   zion in high school played the top of a 1-3-1 where he had free reign to go for steals and blocks. in college, Cam Reddish took Wing 1, RJ Wing 2, Jones/Goldwire the guards, and Delaurier and Bolden took the best bigs. they stuck Zion on the worst guy and he was able to sag off and make those crazy blocks   you can watch Luke Maye absolutely dust Zion in college.   Zion doesn‚Äôt have the lateral quickness"
"Probably Cam reddish, the way other NBA players talk about him you would think he‚Äôs like a monster every game and his offensive game is so raw"
Do people still think Cam Reddish will breakout some day?
"It's possible. Prior to last season, we kept getting reports that Cam Reddish was getting taller. Now, he's around 7'9""."
"Reddish is a all over the place that's why. But the flashes are already there, if he could be more consistent this season and we can extend him next off-season for a reasonable cost we'd be better off moving with Cam, Hunter, and Huerter as our core wings. This is assuming Cam improves though."
"For sure I def get it and you cant just let talent like that go. But like the originally post that extra star internally needs to happen fast because you have extensions hitting fast. Hunter will get a max, Huerter and Cam will get decent deals as well. I think they should consildate Collins, Reddish, and picks for a second star to go along with Trae like Pascal Siakam or Jaylen Brown"
"$23m is fairly high for a role player/trade piece ‚Äî especially when they already had him locked at $18 till 22/23  By 24/25, the cap will be tight when they are paying Trae &amp; Collins a combined $60m and at least one of the rookie contracts: OO, Cam Reddish, DeAndre Hunter, Kevin Huerter. What if Capella becomes injury prone again?"
i hope the Hawks don‚Äôt give up on Cam Reddish
"No, there are other agents that represent Trae Young, Cam Reddish, Aaron Gordon, Ant Edwards etc. But Rich Paul has clients on 4 west playoff teams not counting the Lakers."
"Trae, Ant, and Cam Reddish are represented by Omar Wilkes not Rich Paul."
"I honestly think the best package for both parties would be CJ McCollum and Nance for Simmons and Thybulle/Maxey. It would be bittersweet for both teams, but this is the closest of a middle ground that I can think for any team in the NBA. Portland gets a lockdown defender (which he is. Simmons is a perennial DPOY candidate) 1-4 and a prospect, Philly gets an all-around shooter and a plug and play PF.   Morey won't be able to trade him for Dame or Beal, but he should not accept a package around Cam Reddish."
"I guess I‚Äôm just annoyed at the fact that we don‚Äôt get credit for beating them when Trae was injured, we had no Deandre Hunter, no Cam Reddish, and an injured Bogi who shot around 15 - 20 % every game because his knee was noticeably injured. To add to it Seth Curry averaged 21 on 79% true shooting and Joel still averaged 30ppg and it‚Äôs like damn, we deserve some fucking respect you know? All I hear are oh well 6ers lost to themselves and it‚Äôs like no, you lost to the Hawks without 3 starters and an injured Trae."
Cam reddish.
"Think it's a combination of both tbh. Like if you saw Khris Middleton's turnovers, oftentimes they're just him getting stripped by the likes of Cam Reddish or Kevin Huerter, so you can credit that to the defense a majority of the time.  In the case of Embiid, not only does he have a loose handle, dude doesn't know where to throw the ball, and in some horrible instances, he threw it straight to the defense (see some of those transition passes). So while K'Von and Gallinari were very smart in how they doubled Embiid (and incredibly effective), there's also the factor Embiid passes like he's drummond"
Cam reddish norristown
"1) KAT is technically a fringe all-star, so that's the easy answer.  2) Dark horse - Nikiel Alexander-Walker. He's finally starting this year. As a starter last year, he averaged like 20 pts a game. Add that to not having Stan Van Gundy as the coach, and 2 other all-star teammates, I think the Pelicans compete for the playoffs this year.  3) Super dark horse - Killa Cam Reddish...(not a homer pick)"
Yeah and Cam reddish has potential to be MVP
Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish
Killer Cam Reddish
"Cam reddish , although I think he‚Äôll have to be traded for it to happen"
Cam Reddish üò™  I still believe in him tho
"If we assume Ben Simmons is traded before All-Star weekend, I think it's someone from the east. My gut says LaMelo probably has a good shot, or maybe Cam Reddish finally breaks out?"
"Cam Reddish, Tyler Herro, PG13  Perimeter oriented streaky scorers with consistency issues"
"lol more like the Hawks beat you despite the fact they were missing their second best player that year in Deandre Hunter, had injuries to Bogdan and Trae, and were also missing a useful wing defender in Cam Reddish. So no, I don‚Äôt think your guys win 10/10 in your fictional scenario."
Guards and wings aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.   Zach Lavine is a guard and a wing.   Cam Reddish is a guard and a wing  Anthony Edwards is a guard and a wing
"Horford and Kanter are upgrades over what they had in the front court and JRich and Schroder can be useful role players, but everyone else that you listed is pretty unproven as of right now. I could see Pritchard and Time Lord making jumps but that happening is far from a given.  As for how they match up with the Hawks, I think the obvious solution for them to slow down Brown and Tatum would be to put DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish on them. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd shut them down but I also think those two combined with good rim protection from Clint Capela would at least cause some problems for the Celtics. I also don‚Äôt think the Celtics would be able to slow Trae down. He went against three top defenses in the post season and averaged 28 points and 9 assists"
"hmm maybe if Hayward can be healthy this season they can trade him for a younger asset? (Maybe if ATL is looking to make a real playoff push, Cam Reddish?)"
"Atlanta is a poor example here. Capela did elevate us from last year and the year before when we had the likes of jabari Parker and Alex Len playing in the middle, but to say that our wing defense was soft is not that accurate. Deandre Hunter, until he got hurt against Philly, was shaping up to be one of the premier wing defenders in the league. He‚Äôs a guy you can put on the other team‚Äôs best player and forget about it. Same with cam reddish, except he was out the second half of the year and only played ECF last few games. Bogi and K‚Äôvon both solid team wing defenders. The biggest weak spots on the hawks D are Trae Young against the opposing ball handler, and John Collins against bigger PF and Cs."
"Nah he reps Trae Young, Jalen Johnson and Cam Reddish so at the moment all my homies love Rich Paul"
  Just let me spread my Cam Reddish agenda in peace pls
This.  Those two and Cam Reddish look like stars when they are on.
Cam Reddish 100%
"Id say the Suns over the Hawks. Trae and Booker cancel each other out. Ayton, Bridges, Cam Johnson over Reddish, Huerter, and Hunter (who I really like)"
"Zion, RJ and Cam Reddish gonna team up to avenge their disappointing march madness campaign with duke"
"Up until last night, Cam reddish has looked that way. He didn‚Äôt look bad; he missed a couple wide open looks and the team never went back to him. He‚Äôs a rhythm player and can‚Äôt be left to stand in the corner every possession. He did so well the first few games because he actually touched the ball every possession. Now that Gallo is back, the offense runs through him on the second unit. We‚Äôll see how that goes for Cam."
"Cam Reddish, Saddiq Bey. Jordan Poole I'm not that sold yet, hope it was not just preseason fluke. Desmond Bane. Jordan Nwora. Mo Bamba. Tyrese Maxey. Keldon Johnson."
I got him. Cam Reddish. Nd Tyler Herro as 6moty rn
As someone that was sitting in the Tucker Civic Center when Cam Reddish hit the three pointer with less than 5 seconds left to put Duke up 2 on FSU‚Ä¶never again. Never wanna be there for a heartbreaking loss that arena was silent as we all filed out
"cole anthony is gonna be in the mix for most improved.   cam reddish in the mix, jordan poole and rj barrett slipping a bit."

Cam Reddish masterclass incoming
Because Cam Reddish is an elite two way wing
Cam Reddish is an elite two-way wing
Cam Reddish is an elite two-way wing.
"There were rumors that ATL was looking to move Cam Reddish in the offseason and at that time I would say Reddish and White's value were comparable and I'd even give the edge to White. But since the season started, Reddish has been playing like Paul George so I doubt ATL would want to move him at all anymore."
If I could trade him for cam reddish &amp; our Portland pick I would do it.
"Cam Reddish, Alperen Sengun, Amir Coffey and Caleb Martin are getting to the line more frequently per game. Damn."
cam reddish will have the best nba career of the 3 dukies
"Cam is gunning but I like it. Bogi is still more valuable as the starter but we'll see how things develop.  Hunter is good, honestly the better he gets the more worried I get about managing our depth of talent.  Collins needs to be featured more, he's already good at doing all the little stuff.  We've got good depth at PG, really all over and Dieng gives another option even when Okongwu comes back.  A little less Solo, a little more Jalen Johnson please, especially if we're playing bad teams.  Long term - wondering what Reddish/Galinari trade package could get us...."
"I want Timothe Luwawu Carrabot to be better than he is, I feel like he looks like Cam Reddish did last year. Hes trying to do too much with his limited opportunities, hes rushing his jumper and his drives, and his handle looks sloppy from how much he is jumping the gun. Hope he can provide a bit more in his minutes as the season goes o  and he settles into his role."

Cam Reddish for MIP
Yo is cam reddish really here woahhhhh
"Luka is much easier to build around. Cam Reddish did not make a difference for the Hawks in the playoffs, that's what the Hawks got from the trade."
"The Hawks ""won"" the trade insofar as they were actually able to put a proper team around their player, with or without Cam Reddish."
CAM  REDDISH
Cam Reddish goat?
"Cam ""Bust"" Reddish"
Cam Reddish masterclass incoming üòà
"Cam Reddish MVP and Hunter DPOY, who says no?"
Misspelled Cam Reddish
Damn I guess Deandre Hunter and Cam Reddish just didn't play last night
Was it Kidd or was it DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish?
There is no recency bias. All year I‚Äôve said Hunter is our second best player and that doesn‚Äôt change just because Bogi was solid while he was hurt. When Bogis shot isn‚Äôt falling he‚Äôs pretty much a non factor offensively.  It‚Äôs not the same for Deandre. Hunter can score from all parts of the floor. The only part of his game that needs improvement is hitting the 3 at a higher clip.    If Cam Reddish develops which is the context of my comment he would literally be the same as Hunter with a better ability to get to the rack. He would also be 100x better than Bogi on defense. It would be a no brainer to move Bogi. But again this is only if cam develops and shows he‚Äôs a consistent offensive threat.    You can disagree but to suggest I don‚Äôt know basketball Is a joke
Did you watch the game last night? Cam Reddish looks great.
Cam Reddish is about to take a leap forward this year. He looked amazing last night. Sixth Man of the Year watch.
"If Hunter and Cam go off and stay healthy‚Ä¶they stay. The decision probably becomes Kevin vs Bogi‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs probably Bogi who goes even though he‚Äôs the better player. Highly hypothetical and I‚Äôm no GM, but Reddish and Hunter covering Trae on defense was the plan all along, Reddish was inconsistent/hurt, and Hunter was flat out hurt."
"Idk why everyone keeps comparing Trae and Luka, we traded the Mavs so we could pick up cam reddish, trae was a throw in"
"But projecting 28 year old Anthony Davis and 31 year old Dame Lillard is not the same as projecting 20 year old cam reddish. These are proven players who produce year after year, not much 'potential' involved because their in their primes"
"this has more to do with Cam Reddish, DeAndre Hunter, and Clint Capela tbh"
Hawks also got an extra 1st..which was Cam Reddish. If he plays like he did tonight all year. Hawks win that trade easy.
"Yeah Atlanta never been as behind the Hawks as they are now. We are like 11 or 12 deep no joke. I can speak for the fanbase that we are all salivating at thought of a healthy season from Hunter &amp; Cam and crew, because those too specifically have Kawhi/PG13 levels of potential (dont expect HOF like Kawhi but Hunter plays a lot like.him and that's his closest comp, probably not as high a ceiling.) We at r/atlantahawks are also super pro Reddish with an unshakable belief he will be a monster once he puts it together. Welcome to the Cam Fam  B)"

"Besides Pat Williams, your starting lineup is weak defensively. The Hawks have two players starting who can make all defensive team. Then John Collins who isn't shabby himself. Oh and Cam reddish and Onyeka on the bench. Thats just defensively. Your starting line up is pretty good but im talking about the entire team."
"Yup, I agree. The amount of young talent they have is astounding. We could use one slightly used Cam Reddish though."
Common Misconception: Cam Reddish is *not* on the Mavs:  Though he might have been if not for a Draft Night trade with Atlanta!

Imagine getting Cam Reddish plus some kid from the midwest
getting Cam Reddish and Hunter in the same draft gotta be illegal

Hey guys I just checked and Cam Reddish is not north of 300 pounds not even close
Imagine being guarded by Hunter for 15 mins then Hunter goes off so you think you have a break but a fresh Cam Reddish comes in.

"In the NBA, a dollar is worth more than four quarters. That is, a guy who puts up 24/8/8 is worth *way more* than four times what four guys putting up 7/2/2 are worth.   Luka puts up 26/8/8 with average defense.   Trae puts up 24/4/9 with bad defense. Cam Reddish (part of the trade) puts up 11/4/1 with good defense.   Luka is the dollar to Trae 50-cent coin and Cam's quarter, but it's closer than people think imo. If Luka becomes an MVP putting up 32/9/9 on good efficiency and decent defense at his peak, but Trae becomes a top 3 PG putting up 28/2/10 on better efficiency, and Cam becomes a solid starting quality player, it's more like ninety cents to Luka's dollar. But in the end, I think the Mavs are on top.   As an analogy -- would a team rather have peak Lebron, or peak Lillard and peak Robert Covington? I think 30 out of 30 teams take Lebron."
Imagine being guarded by Hunter for 15 mins then Hunter goes off so you think you have a break but a fresh Cam Reddish comes in.

A good defender is rarely ever a negative for the team.  Hunter is also a good defender and can shoot, but he doesn't have the attitude. He doesn't try to take over games. He is okay just being a cog in the machine. When you have multiple stars, a guy like that is valuable. We don't have that luxery. Great players aren't exactly lining up to come to Atlanta, and Trae  just doesn't feel the same this year. If we want to compete for a championship, we probably need a current player to emerge as a star.  Reddish is literally the only option. I hope that happens."
Cam Reddish is an elite two-way wing.
Cam Reddish is an elite two-way wing.
Cam Reddish is an elite two-way wing.
Cam Reddish is an elite two-way wing.
Cam Reddish is an elite two-way wing.
Cam Reddish is coming üòà
"Say it with me r/nba, Cam Reddish is an elite two-way wing."
Same but with Cam Reddish lmao
Boston and Zaire were this year's edition of the Cam Reddish 'Absolutely Sucked in College but have the NBA body/High School Resume' draft archetype.
Cam Reddish trash
"Our core is set pretty much, the consensus is we're missing a 3 and D wing ala Mikal Bridges/Cam Reddish. We're hoping Okoro develops into one."
"True I evaluate players differently too. That's why I'd rather have Cam Reddish on my team rather than Kevin Durant lol   Also that whole narrative of Lonzo not being a half court playmaker is so dumb. If you look at his AST% with under 15 sec on the shot clock, it's still near the top of the league."
"Well 12 states don't have mandated vaccines. Kyrie value did go down but is still talented to take a risk.   The notable names are Utah and Georgia. I don't see kyrie fitting with Luca in Texas and Miami has Lowry. Arizona has cp3.   A sign and trade for Mike Conley, and jordan Clarkson might work.    Atlanta Bogdan, cam reddish and lots of picks  or hueter, Bogdan and like 2 picks"
Someone like a Cam Reddish is probably getting pretty close to the end of his grace period. He'd want to make some progress by the end of year 3.
We look better with Kev as a starter. Also Cam reddish is an enigma. He‚Äôs either awful or great. Tonight he was great
Cam reddish is that guy
Cam reddish would‚Äôve been a sure fire number one pick
Cam Reddish will have a more successful career than Zion and RJ
Cam reddish will play one game a month where he looks like he finally learned when to shoot and put all the pieces together. And then he misses 17 straight shots across 3 games
"I'll take one Cam Reddish. DFS and a lottery protected FRP, eh? Good, eh?"
Cam Reddish actively trying to prove something is generally gonna lead to bad results. Hopefully he proves that he can move the ball and find open teammates.
Big prove it stretch for Cam Reddish
"Cam Reddish for Lebron James, straight up"
"Cam Reddish is actually GOD, but he disguises it  source: trust me"
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12.

Alperen Sengun 24. Matisse Thybulle 25. Tyrese Haliburton 26. Rui Hachimura 27. Chris Duarte 28. Deni Avdija 29. Immanuel Quickley 30. Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
"I think it's a 3 guard, small ball unit with;  Jalen Brunson Tyler Herro Alex Caruso Cam Reddish Precious Achiuwa (now that he's coming off the bench)   Most of these guys could start on many teams and have shown that. They also play as closers frequently.   As a Spurs fan I had to stop myself from putting Devin Vassell in there for either Brunson or Caruso (although he might play his way in soon at this rate)."
"Literally no one not named Trae Young or John Collins has been playing well. Defensive effort and execution has been piss poor across the board, and Huerter/Gallinari/Hunter have all been cold from the field for the most part.   We also have several players who have seemingly forgotten how to pass the basketball (Hunter, reddish, gallinari) and are ruining any semblance of ball movement that the offense should have (Hunter‚Äôs assist rate is 3% which is absurdly terrible). Cam Reddish had a handful of good games to start the season and has been complete trash on both ends since then."
"If you don't think Trae is going to make a massive jump, why would you think fucking Cam Reddish will? It's just easier to illustrate with Trae since we all watch top players. But Cam is likely already who he is, same with the rest of their 22ish-year-old players. Why would we assume they are going to make the jump to the next level instead of just staying?"
"they need to trade one while they can  i don‚Äôt know if either will turn into what they‚Äôre hoped to be and i say that as someone who has a ton of De‚ÄôAndre Hunter stock   Cam Reddish is just an inconsistent shooter who can‚Äôt dribble or pass and has horrible decision making‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not a surprise they were trying to trade him this past offseason and considering he‚Äôs up for contract, i highly doubt he‚Äôs on the team after the deadline"
"Rashad phillips is the worst account on twitter lol. But yeah, even somewhat reputable people have been drooling over him. It's amazing how easily people confuse a hot shooting stretch with a ""leap"". I think it was KOC who was like ""cam reddish is finally putting it all together"" meanwhile he has like 5 assists on the year and still cant make a layup."
Bench units led by untouchable trade asset cam reddish are getting destroyed
"how good would the all-color team be  Jaylen Brown  Jeff Green  Draymond Green  Derrick White  Bruce Brown  Bench:  Danny Green  Cam Reddish  Derrick Rose   What if you added LeBrown James, Kelly Ochre Jr. and Bradley Teal"
"Personally I want more minutes for cam. He is a great defender and is energetic on offense. He isn't very consistent, but additional playing time will help.  Hunter and Collins are bother much better defenders than Towns, but neither one can score consistently outside of Collins catching lobs. Capella and reddish can cover up a lot of the defensive issues KAT and Trae create.  Hunter has been inconsistent and injured pretty often. I know he hasn't been in the league very long, but I'm willing to risk losing him for Towns.  It will also help Trae to have another guy on the court that can draw a double team.  I think a starting lineup of Trae, KAT, Capella, cam, and bogdonavic (if he can remember how to shoot) with huerter, delon Wright /Lou, gallinari, onyeka (when he comes back) and anyone but Solomon hill is a pretty solid roster.  Also I would include Solomon hill in trade because he sucks ass."
Cam reddish is the answer
Cam reddish. Other teams should give the hawks several first round picks for the chance to have him
"The Hawks have so many young forwards with very high potential. Cam Reddish, Deandre Hunter, Jalen Johnson. I doubt you can develop all those guys while also having John Collins"
"Jalen Brunson: on a team where he isn't forced to play off the ball/come off the bench he could put up some great numbers - I think he is so much better than his stats indicate and is being held back in Dallas.  Moses Moody: one of my favourites from this draft class, can't really get on the court because Warriors.  Malik Beasley: Really talented shooter/scorer, has had a very slow start but they've cut his role/minutes/usage. Kinda sucks because he was in a bad situation (in terms of available minutes) in Denver, and has now been kind of pushed to the side in Minnesota after playing so well for them last year.  Devin Vassell: He's gonna be a star, but in traditional Pop fashion he's being brought along very slowly. He's gonna get minutes eventually there and I know they love him but still wish he was given a bit more leash like he would on another team.  Aaron Nesmith: Talented kid, confidence I think has been an issue for him and don't think Boston for numerous reasons is the best place for him to flourish.  Cam Reddish: Begging to break out, but Atlanta has so many wings that his minutes are capped and inconsistent.  Patrick Williams: He's hurt right now, but I feel like they went into win-now so fast that he's kind of been left behind. He looked amazing in summer league and then barely got shots on the actual team - granted he didn't deserve shots over their other guys but still he has so much potential and I think he would reach it much faster on another team on a better suited timeline for him.  Jordan Nwora: Really talented scorer and showed out a bit with a lot of people hurt, and probably earned a rotation spot - but when everyone is healthy that role gets smaller and smaller. I wonder how he'd do on another team.  Marcus Garrett: Less of a 'free him' and more of a name to watch, he's a crazy defender and I think will be one of those Heat rotation players that comes out of nowhere in a year or two.  Paul Reed: I want to see what he can do as a starting center with big minutes, dude can really play but he's behind Embiid and Drummond (and probably their PFs too)"
Cam reddish i feel like he can do more with a starting role
"I just don‚Äôt get why Trae Young isn‚Äôt in when Curry‚Äôs in. Like in the 3rd quarter: Not for defense obviously, but Trae elevates the Hawks offense and it was needed to match the momentum of Curry‚Äôs 3rd quarter. Instead, Trae and Collins on the bench as the warriors go up 20. Huerter is initiating the offense and had the ball stolen like twice. Makes no sense. Also, is it me or did Danilo Gallinari regress or is being used wrong? Couldn‚Äôt post up nor could he shoot. And Hawks fans: who‚Äôs better? Deandre hunter or Cam reddish?"
Im a knicks fan but purely talent wise Cam Reddish is more talented than RJ. He isn‚Äôt as good a player but just raw talent he has him beat.   JR Smith is also more talented than a guy like Kyle Lowry but talent only takes you so far.
He‚Äôs gonna say cam reddish üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"I think that with that win, we had 6% to draft Zion instead of having 8 or 9%. The problem was that neither teams (dallas or memphis) wanted to win that game, but Mejri turned into prime shaq. And because we didn‚Äôt get the top 5 pick we had to give the pick to atlanta (10 pick-cam reddish)"
They traded the draft rights to Cam Reddish sadly
Patty Mills  Kemba? Or is he more of a #2 ?  For the hawks it alternates between cam reddish and DeAndre Hunter lol
"It wont happen but Atlanta should do it. Hawks fans will scream about this being too much but then a few yrs from now when they see the ECF in 2021 was the furtherest theyll ever get to with this core theyll regret not offering Capela/Hunter/picks. Throw in untouchable trade asset Cam Reddish, still wont change the fact they should do it."
Maybe I‚Äôm biased but it‚Äôs an Absolute sham that Jarrett Allen or Garland isn‚Äôt on this list but cam reddish is
Cam Reddish off the bench is better than prime Paul George
&gt;#####A new season means new players stepping to the forefront. Here are a handful who look like they could make a leap two weeks into 2021-22.  --- Included players:  &gt;* Miles Bridges {CHA} * Ja Morant {MEM} * Tyler Herro {MIA} * OG Anunoby {TOR} * Cole Anthony {ORL} * Harrison Barnes {SAC} * Desmond Bane {MEM} * Jakob Poeltl {SAS} * Cam Reddish {ATL} * Mo Bamba {ORL}
Trae doesn‚Äôt win the ‚Äúabsolutely atrocious‚Äù award for the Hawks tonight - that steaming pile goes to Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish might be a double agent.
Cam Reddish single handedly bringing down the Hawks
Ngl I was burned by Josh Jackson being a bust and Cam Reddish being in that archetype spooked me. Hope he does end up being really good.
CAM REDDISH MASTERCLASS INCOMINGüî•
Hawks get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Robert Williams  * Juancho Hernangomez (filler)  Celtics get:   * Bogdan Bogdanovic  * John Collins  * Cam Reddish  Hawks end up with the best player overall. Celtics turn two really good players into three really good players.   Hawks run Trae/Brown/Huerter/Hunter/Capela  Celtics run Smart/Bogdanovic/Tatum/Collins/Horford with Cam Reddish off the bench
Worked for Cam Reddish
"Trae still looks like Trae and might lead the league in assists this year so that‚Äôs cool. John Collins looks like he might get some All-Star votes and has improved his ball handling/passing. Cam Reddish looks like he is our 3rd best player which is really exciting but also kinda bad at the same time lol. Hunter doesn‚Äôt look to good, Bogi started shooting again I feel good about this team and think we can finish as a top 3 seed in the east. We have a lot of picks and young talent so there‚Äôs always a chance we make a move for a star at the deadline so that‚Äôs exciting as well."
Cam reddish
mmmmm gimme Cam Reddish
"Trae, Cam Reddish"
Cam Reddish and Deandre Hunter
I'm starting to think this cam reddish guy is pretty good
I was gonna fall to my knees and throw up if that Cam Reddish free throw at the end fell out
Cam Reddish
"I can see Ziaire being one who takes 2 or 3 years and then really starts to show how good he can be, sort of like Cam Reddish is doing this season."
"If anything Duke wasted Cam Reddish. He had bad games but also 0 confidence due to how coach K used him, 0 rhythm."
Cam reddish will run away with the award after his six 65 point games in a row
Cam Reddish looked really good vs the sixers. I see why hawks fans like him
Cam reddish
The Celtics aren't on shit. And Jayson Tatum is closer to the Devin Booker/Trae Young tier than Jimmy Butler and Paul George  Zion's gonna come back healthy and make a big mid-season push for the Pels.  Cam Reddish is going to establish himself as the 3rd best player from his class.  The Bulls are going to run through the regular season but get trounced in the 1st round.
"You‚Äôre just comparing stats of a 6 game sample.  Nice work.  Literally does nothing to explain the ‚Äúlack of confidence and aggression in RJ‚Äù.  How about we go to the off-season where trainers were telling Cam Reddish how they wanted him to play more like RJ, who after missing a shot comes right back down and takes another shot."
Thinking directly of Cam reddish reading this
"Gud ebening, Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks is one of the best passers in the game. The offense is potent when everyone is healthy, and De‚ÄôAndre Hunter and Clint Capela are some of the anchors on defense. Cam Reddish is as well, but he is injured currently."
I don‚Äôt think Cam Reddish will be anything more than a role player. It‚Äôs too streaky and oft-injured
As a Hawks fan I am legally required to remind you that Luka Doncic was drafted by the Atlanta Hawks and then traded for Trae Young and the pick that became Cam Reddish.
"I am glad we got Trae, and if cam reddish turns out to be good I think it‚Äôll make even more sense. Luka is cool tho ig"
We got Cam Reddish too..
"The Bigger Picture:  Rj Barrett is a bust.  Randle is good but when double-teamed he can't produce and he's not a good passer either.  For the ATL - Trae Young is an All-Star, Bogi is a Star, D Hunter is a Star.  Still have Cam Reddish too."
"Umm yes, in fact, I think that Cam Reddish is a better pick."
Now imagine if Cam Reddish was good
"You will take Cam Reddish, 2 first rounders and Gallo and you will like it good sir"
He didn't have the yips he just sucks. He shot 35% from the field at Duke under coach k you gonna tell me he was a trash coach too?  Hunter looked good under Pierce. Trae looked good. Weird how only Cam Reddish looks like garbage no matter where he plays (and I live in Atlanta and catch hella Hawks games - Cam Reddish was never good).
They wasted that pick on scrub ass Cam Reddish though.
it's luka vs trae + cam reddish
Cam Reddish &gt; RJ Barrett
"He‚Äôs been dealing with injuries over the season tbf, but cam reddish has been the least improved player"
"Mavs had a three way coin flip between getting Zion, Ja, or sending the 10th pick (Cam Reddish) to Atlanta. What could have been..."
If cam reddish can be any sorts of serviceable for the hawks in his career you really can't argue the hawks lost the trade anymore
"If you ask all 30 GMs in the NBA whether they'd have Luka or Trae Young + Cam Reddish, 29 of them are taking Luka."
It was Trae and Cam Reddish so I seriously doubt Dallas doesn't win the trade considering the way Reddish's career is going
Wasnt it cam reddish you got with the pick?  Hunter was the hawks own pick
Trae is very good; but Luka is a transcendent generational superstar. An extra pick (Cam Reddish) doesn‚Äôt make up for that.
"It was a win-win trade  Mavs got a generational talent  Hawks got a superstar, and a pick which they used to get another young talent in Cam Reddish"
"Cam Reddish is a funny player. I swear every time I watch him I'm like 'uh oh this kid is starting to look really good' then he'll have a sequence where he'll inexplicably miss an open dunk, travel on the next possession, and get caught on a backdoor."
"1. Gallo help defense  2. Cam Reddish drives to the basket  3. Capela misses point-blank layup.  though capela does usually rebound it, then make the 2nd one."
Cam Reddish
cam reddish hasnt helped a team win since high school
"Honestly I‚Äôm just happy to be in the playoffs, but after that game I am just super hyped on this team. Our oldest starter is Bodgan at 28 but we‚Äôre playing without Cam Reddish. Trae is only 22, and John Collins is 23. There‚Äôs not been a brighter moment in Hawks basketball that I can remember."
I want this timeline. Heavy feature on RJ Barrett v Cam Reddish too.
"&gt; but if Cam Reddish pans out.  Yeah, idk about that one...  But frankly it's not worth getting hung up on, I think we're just all in on enjoying Trae now."
I fuck with Cam Reddish but he will not be the difference maker in the trade unless he turns into Klay Thompson or something lol
Ehh. We got Cam Reddish out of the trade as well who is a really solid player in only his second year. Time will tell but for now it‚Äôs too early.
"Kid showed no fear in his debut. Trae might not be Luka, but if Cam Reddish pans out... the Hawks didn't lose that trade"
"If you squint, you might see Cam Reddish"
Cam reddish blows them both out of the water on defense.
"Depends.      Right now, it looks like Dallas scored big. However both have played just 3 seasons. Both were All-Rookie 1st selections. The variable here is Cam Reddish, and if he develops into (*maybe*) a solid 3 &amp; D then I would suggest Atlanta did just as well as Dallas."
And Cam Reddish.
Cam reddish is bad
"I don‚Äôt get it with him. He was bad at Duke, still got drafted in lottery, he‚Äôs been bad his first two years in the NBA. I just don‚Äôt see how there‚Äôs any evidence Cam Reddish being good at basketball"
Cam reddish. please.
"For the Hawks it‚Äôd likely be:  Protected:  * Trae, Capela, Collins, Hunter, Huerter, Bogi, Okongwu, Reddish  Draft Eligible:  * Gallo, Goodwin, Bruno Fernando, Mays and Knight  Lou and Snell are FAs this year. I went back and forth between Gallo and Cam for the last spot of protected because outside of his defense, Cam was bad this year. But his rookie contract and team control outweighed Gallo‚Äôs offensive production and current contract, given that its short term after this season (next season is guaranteed, then $5M guaranteed in the last year) and would free up cap space in the short-term."
CAM REDDISH! PLEASE!
Remember last season when Jordan Poole was generationally bad in terms of fg% along with Cam Reddish? Things changed fast in one season lol
"And missing their best perimeter defender in Hunter, and Cam Reddish. Suns had been lucky with injuries until this series."
It‚Äôs a terrible take for that reason and because the Hawks would be in almost the exact position they‚Äôre in now if they drafted Trae at 3 instead of trading back to 5. They drafted Cam Reddish with the pick they acquired in 2019 who‚Äôs been out most of the year and hasn‚Äôt been very good when he‚Äôs played.
It doesn‚Äôt matter how many words you write. Comparing Deandre Hunter and Cam Reddish to James Harden and Kyrie Irving is laughable. Take off those homer goggles.
"This is kinda dumb. The Hawks traded down so they could get the pick that becomes Cam Reddish. Unless Reddish becomes something, it was a pointless trade."
Even if they had a 6‚Äô8 Cam Reddish they‚Äôd still be insane
I think I see the cam reddish comparisons now to Paul George. He plays like playoff p except for the whole season.
Imagine this team with a healthy Hunter and a healthy 6‚Äô10 Cam Reddish
The most annoying part to me is they forgot about Cam Reddish who I see getting to at least Hunter‚Äôs level
"Trae was stuck on a really really bad Hawks team for the last few years. Between Collins and Huerter developing, the signing of Gallinari and Bogdanovic, and the trade for Capela, he finally has a team around him that allows him to be the elite playmaker that he is. With a healthy De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish, this team should be a contender for years to come."
"We will see! Cam Reddish is a complete wild card, but some reports are now saying he is closer to 6'10"". But yeah he cannot stay healthy and plays completely out of control"
"Listened/watched every game and the Hawks never got any recognition. Currently, they‚Äôre missing Deandre Hunter (starter), Cam Reddish and Bogdanovic is injured. Only way from here is up as everyone is super young."
"‚ÄúReddish didn‚Äôt do anything‚Äù  Bro he hasn‚Äôt even played a whole season yet. He‚Äôs 21 lmao. Cam has plenty of time to develop, he was already our best defender by far and showed some flashes of offensive talent. Just needs to get healthy and more consistent"
"Yeah. Cam Reddish has been out for 4 months, but he's back in the lineup. Hawks aren't ready to play him yet, as it'll be a lot of pressure on him. Hunter had a meniscus tear after the Knick's series, so they opted to perform surgery on it, and he's out for the remainder of the Playoffs. Just like Reddish, Dunn hasn't played for the majority of the season due to injury. They're holding him out of the rotation out of fear being off sync.  If the Hawks even had at least two of those guys ready to play, and if Bogdanovic wasn't wobbled, Milwaukee would be in serious trouble."
"Is Cam Reddish, DeAndre Hunter, and Kriss Dunn hurt? I thought they were too banged up but the baby point God keeps proving everybody wrong"
Cam Reddish
And we got cam reddish too.
Any idea when Cam Reddish will be back?
You debased yourself by calling Cam Reddish a potential all star. I didn't really think that was popping off but just showing your ass.
"Literally every team has had some injury issues these playoffs.  The Hawks, supposedly a worse team, are missing Cam Reddish *and* Deandre Hunter *and* Bogi is playing on one leg.  Kawhi out, CP3 out for the first few games in the west.    Every team is playing hurt.  It isn't ""sad"" not many people mention it, it just is reality because your opponent is just as banged up, if not moreso.  So it would be a pretty dumb thing to mention.  Y'all are the *heavy* favorites, it's just a bad excuse.  Don't get me wrong, you are better with Donte, but you should still 100% win the series on paper."
The Hawks also got Cam Reddish which is important to remember.
"You right, but let‚Äôs stop pretending like cam reddish is relevant."
"Bogdanovic at this point is basically a non factor, the Hawks could really use Cam Reddish for the rest of the games"
"Trae‚Äôs the 2nd best Point guard in the NBA. If the Hawks are smart, they build a team around him that kind of has a resemblance to the Warriors when they were winning. Make Cam Reddish &amp; Hunter become lock down defensive wings that can shoot anywhere on the court. Hawks do that &amp; that‚Äôs a championship core."
Hawks are 1-0 in playoff games that cam reddish is available to play
"We frankly don't know if Hawks pick up Hunter, without the Reddish pick, so it's not a clean Luka for Trae + Cam"
Cam Reddish.
cam reddish iis useless
Is Cam Reddish getting any playing time?
What happened with cam reddish?
7'6 Cam reddish on the bench and wont play him tf
Free cam reddish
solo needs to be cam reddish
So can rusty Cam Reddish help this Hawks team or not?
"I may be reactionary, but I‚Äôd rather see Cam Reddish over Bogi rn. He‚Äôs just not effective on that bad knee."
If they fucking play cam reddish their defense would be fine
Cam Reddish can't be worse than Solomon Hill right? Is it cause Reddish is a sophomore and might foul too much or make defensive lapses?
Is cam reddish active yet? Throw him in for bogi maybe?
How much playing time do we think Cam Reddish is getting tonight?
TONIGHT WE WITNESS THE RISE OF CAM REDDISH! STAY TUNEDüòà
Cam Reddish about to score 20
At first I read this as in Cam Reddish should be available for trade lol sorry guys already in F5 mode
"Hawks draft picks in top 15 since 2016:  1. Trae Young  * Starter. All-Star. 2. Cam Reddish  * 26 games, 21 starts this season. 0 playoff games. 3. Deandre Hunter  * 23 games, 19 starts this season. 5 playoff games played (Knicks series, 0 in Philly series) 4. Onyeka Okongwu  * Rookie. Backup center. 50 games, 4 starts this season. Played every games in the playoffs.   Yes, the other two are injured, but they didn't have a huge impact on how this playoff run is going."
Yeah they don't need to play KD anymore but 7'0 Cam Reddish just came off injury reserve so there's that
"When the only real argument you can have about the players that you drafted are, ""Well they aren't (other guy)."" I would say that they are pretty good draft picks.  If Cam Reddish can be saved and become a good player you could argue that the Hawks made a good trade...but sadly I never see that happening at this point."
Suns need Cam Reddish for the Cam trifecta
"Cam Reddish is on the Hawks, so it's not a complete monopoly."
"Great analysis, hoping Cam Reddish can provide some minutes at SF in this upcoming series, as Middleton is a bit more mobile than Harris. Props to Gallo for his defense though"
"I think you are too close to see it dude. It'd be like me as a Bulls fan arguing that Coby White is a potential all star because of a few awesome games and only being two years into his career. Yeah, theoretically, it's possible but just because its possible doesn't mean there's a great potential for it with a 12 point PER.   Making an all star is very hard and it's even harder to do it after showing very little in the first two years. Less than 1% of the league make an all star team. Cam Reddish's jumped in PER from 9.03 in his rookie to...9.36 in his second year. That's not the typical growth you'd see from a future all star. If Hunter comes back healthy, Reddish might not even be a starter on his own team next year because Bogdanovic and Huerter have shown way more than him. How's Reddish ever making it as an all star if he is a bench player with a 10-13 PER in year three?  It's easy to have confidence when something is overwhelmingly likely."
Oh man‚Ä¶. Imagine being this low on Cam Reddish. Shows you have no idea how he‚Äôs played for us when he wasn‚Äôt hurt. Dude is 20 years old and you think you know his fate after his rookie year on a lackluster team. Your confidence on this subject is baffling
"But the thing is Deandre hunter is not a bum on offense, cam reddish will not be a bum on offense under Nate McMillan. Both are players capable of creating there own shots. Comparing those two players who are both in there second year to thabo and Robertson is insane.  As for beating the sixers in 7 I guarantee you we beat them in 6 with hunter healthy"
"I am hung on Jabari Parker because it's an example of the General Manager not maximizing everything at his disposal to make the team as good as possible. When you are arguing someone is the best GM in the league you are putting them in a tier with people who make the possible decision time and time again and maximize assets. They didn't do that last season.  They didn't do that when they hired Lloyd Pierce. He even made mistakes this season, not critical ones but still stuff that people at the time knew was bad.  The Hawks are having a great year and are a fun team with tons of toughness shown. You can enjoy the ride and not lose your head and become state run media.   And Cam Reddish all-nba defense? Oh man, just ludicrous."
Also sometimes he literally wears Cam Reddish as a hat
I expect Cam Reddish to develop really well under Nate McMillan especially since LP was fucking bullying himüòÇ
"It's all spaced out pretty evenly, a problem will arise if every last one of the young guys deserves a max, it pains me even more now after that game 7 but I think Huerter will be the guy that will be the hardest to hold onto, someone's probably going to make him an offer he can't refuse that will be substantially more than the Hawks can offer.  All that assumes Cam Reddish isn't a bust, which is still up in the air"
If Deandre Hunter &amp; Cam Reddish stay healthy &amp; flourish the Hawks will have a dynasty for a long time &amp; he really will go down as an all time great.
Very clear you haven't watched any Hawks games if you think Cam Reddish isn't a potential all star LMAO
Praying on that cam reddish MIP campaign
Cam Reddish is a potential all-star? That's such a ridiculous statement that it makes it hard to think you are in a position to look at Schlenk's tenor fairly if you think Reddish has a chance at ever being an all star. I guess in your world that Schlenk hire Lloyd Pierce still has a chance at being named Coach of the Year for the Hawks.  I am not hating by saying someone isn't a best general manager which was the thesis of the post. You clearly can't exist in a place beyond hyperbole.
"I'm so tired of hearing Luka would do this and that in the east. You are speculating. Plus, Cam Reddish has been nice when he has been healthy. Also, a part of that deal.  Yep, he signed Rondo. And yep he flipped him for a better player and better team fit in Lou Will.  'The rest of the league didnt have cap space' is about the dumbest argument I ever heard in regards to his FA signings.  He is clearly one of the best GMs in the league. He drafted John Collins and Kevin Huerter at 19. He drafted/traded for  a superstar in Trae. He drafted potential all-stars in DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish and traded for a top 5 NBA center for literally nothing.  You are hating so hard."
"Cam Reddish with Currys shooting, don‚Äôt need a second one"
No disrespect to OP but man I hate the Luka / Trae comparisons. Luka supporters will always back him &amp; Trae backers will always back him. I think more of the debate is from non ATL/Mavs fans as both fanbases are happy. My biggest pet peeve is if you‚Äôre going to compare them then talk about the trade. Cam Reddish is only 21 years old and needs time to develop but in his almost 26 mins per game when healthy showed flashes and is a good defender. Can‚Äôt rate just part of a trade. Anyways Go HOX!!!
"It‚Äôs too early to say that. There seems to be a lot of drama surrounding Luka, and cam reddish could develop into a star. If hawks win the championship this year, then not a single person in Atlanta regrets this trade. Not to mention that Trae young pretty much put up 30 points and 10 assists a game his sophomore year"
Yes we will. I just don‚Äôt think cam reddish is the lynchpin defensive difference maker you‚Äôre making him out to be.
"Luka has lost 2 years in a row in the first round. The Mavs front office is in disarray. There are reports that Luka is very unhappy and he is being called a diva. I'm his 3rd year, Trae Young has led his team to the conference finals. Despite reports seems to have the respect of his entire team and coaching staff. Doesn't complain about teammates, does his best to make them better. Played with an aged Vince Carter and didn't complain publicly. Just went out and put on a show. Absolutely the toughest guy on the team at 6'1 180 lbs. Trae Young is looking like a Hawks lifer. Luka may very well leave. I haven't even mentioned Cam Reddish yet. With everything said here...3 years in...we're still ok saying Dallas won the trade so far off of stats and potential? Yall enjoy those stats and potential while I watch the Hawks in the ECF."
"Serious question: Does Luka not make this Atlanta team even more of a contender minus Trae Young and Cam Reddish? I legitimately like Trae, but I don't see how the trade made Atlanta better. They have a good squad around Trae, and I don't think that includes Reddish, but maybe I'm wrong."
Cam Reddish too
"Cam reddish is awful, stop it lmao"
"These Hawks are missing their 2nd best player, and no one ever mentions Cam Reddish, who was playing solid defense and dropping 20 fairly often early in the season."
"I‚Äôm not even slandering anything the Hawks have done. Idk why you‚Äôre sounding off on me, clearly they‚Äôve done alot to surround Trae with help to make this ECF possible. I just don‚Äôt think Cam Reddish who hasn‚Äôt been much of a factor yet pushes the Luka/Trae trade to the Hawks side. I think the trade has been pretty even so far. If Cam takes off, so be it."
cam reddish might be traded eventually since there gonna need to pay alot of pppppl
Cam Reddish will atleast one MVP. Y'all will see.
Hawks didn‚Äôt have Deandre Hunter or cam reddish tho
Cam reddish is a bum
Also nets seriously banged up without kyrie and harden a shell of himself.   Credit to the bucks but there is no comparison in that series. You‚Äôre the 1 seed going against an inferior opponent on paper and you lost. Hawks are even missing key players in Deandre hunter and cam reddish
"If Suns win next game then once CP3 comes back it's game over.   I think Suns have to be favorites. I mean no one trusts Coach Bud and the Bucks.  The Hawks are a very young team hobbled with injuries to key players like DeAndre Hunter, Cam Reddish, and now Bogi Bogdonovic. So it would be a miracle if they can even win a game against Bucks. I just don't know if PG can do it alone without Kawhi.   Suns would be healthiest team outside of Chris Paul obviously. So it has to Sun right?"
Okongwu on Giannis?   Cam Reddish?? Do you watch the hawks?
"And the hawks are still limited.  Hunter being out hurts, cam reddish is a solid piece, bogi‚Äôs knee is compromised.  The post season is tough on the body"
Hunter is our second best player easily. He can create his own shot and is a great defender. We are also missing Cam Reddish
We might have Cam Reddish at least
AND the hawks are missing their two best wing defenders in Cam Reddish and DeAndre Hunter to injuries
Deandre hunter and Cam reddish. Would probably help the outbreak of scoring that isn‚Äôt embiid
"DeAndre Hunter, Cam Reddish, and Brandon Goodwin are hurt. Bruno Fernando was Suspended. If Bruno was able to go, it would be a blowout."
"Man I love this Hawks team. And they probably have TOO many young pieces when healthy. They‚Äôre loaded   Porzingis for Deandre Hunter/Cam Reddish, Okongwu, and Clint Capela. Who says no?"
"I guess I was grouping cam reddish in there too, a year too late. Yea I mean not stellar picks but not horrible"
Trae PLUS whoever they would have drafted with the extra FRP. Cam Reddish AND Trae Young and a ring &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Luka
A sixers team with a Joel Embiid at 80% at best and a broken Ben Simmons?   You really think that team stands a better chance than the Hawks who may be getting Cam Reddish back in the line up soon should we win tonight
Cam Reddish also wins a ring so the Mavs lose the trade twice
i don't get the trae inclusion at all. cam reddish runs the show in ATL
I mean trae is a really good offensive player but no one in their right might would trade Luka for him and cam reddish right now‚Ä¶
"Hawks are another the team to challenge the Nets depending on health, skills, and mental improvement from Cam Reddish and DeAndre Hunter. Those 2 wings are vital in slowing down Harden, Kyrie, and KD in ISO situation. They are vital in rotation to shooters with their size, length, and speed."
Game 7 Cam Reddish&gt;
ITS TIME TO UNLEASH CAM REDDISH. his time has comeüòà
ITS TIME TO UNLEASH CAM REDDISH. his time has comeüòà
ITS TIME TO UNLEASH CAM REDDISH. his time has comeüòà
Considering these refs this will probably end up being a flagrant 2 on Cam Reddish or some shit
"If Cam Reddish can even get to a point where he averages 15 with his already amazing defense, I think we‚Äôre really really scary"
Cam reddish and Jarrett Culver
I‚Äôd say the difference is slight (about Cam Reddish size.)
"this is sounding less and less like a hot take, but people saying the mavs won that trade for doncic may have been premature. even if cam reddish isnt quite the rotation player yet, given the turmoil going on in dallas seemingly because of doncic and the dominance trae is showing as a showtime star, its becoming a toss up whether you would rather have trae and cam reddish or luka"
Yeah but Trae Young and Cam Reddish are bringing them to a super championship
"Literal larry tweeted . Cam reddish didnt shoot  in last 4 min of the play ,what was nate thinking"
Fr. Cam Reddish didn't play the entire year and was the best player tonight. Hunter was arguably the second best player on this team before this injury and turned a 2nd team all-NBA player who feasted on us during the regular season into a scrub before he got injured.  The Hawks need to run it back and sell high on whoever they can as they transition from a young team from a team with max salaries on their cap
Cam Reddish was a stand-out tonight. Halted a lot of the Bucks 2nd half momentum with all of those 3 pointers
Lol I was looking at jerseys for you and found [this gem](https://www.lewanoshop.com/products/future-x-atlanta-hawks-cam-reddish-22-limited-edition-jersey?variant=1000004938446565&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwlYCHBhAQEiwA4K21m11NRdFIpxhGx0-Q7YPnKZkbgXyfzH5sg86MJorC5NYCNcrs6WprDBoC_xsQAvD_BwE)
"Cam Reddish and Hunter are gonna be legit af next year with trae, as long as they stay healthy and get a backup point -- they will be top 3 in the east."
"Last I heard, Cam Reddish was supposed to be the worst draft pick in years, now the Hawks look like they're set for a while at basically every position."
"that 3rd quarter was something but the 4th quarter with cam reddish made me feel things like ""kevin garnett anything is possible"" type things"
I think they are 1 star away from being a legit title contender. I think Cam Reddish can become something special. John Collins has been great but if they can flip him for a star player i'd take that risk. They already have great depth
"cam ""trae young"" reddish, dude was 6/7 from deep lmao"
Man Cam Reddish is going to be so nasty with a full offseason and this chip on his shoulder. I'm sure he won tons of fans in the last 2 games.
"Tough game for Atlanta &amp; Congrats to Bucks to making it to the finals.  Bright side for Atlanta is y‚Äôall have a nice squad in the making. Cam Reddish was great tonight, Nate MicMillan is a great coach &amp; you‚Äôll have Deandre Hunters defense when he‚Äôs heathy next year.    A lot of folks thought this squad wasn‚Äôt even a playoff team coming into season. The future is bright for Atlanta."
Now they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish is a STUD.
If trae young or cam reddish were looking for the opportunity to be Reggie Miller. How would be that time
"cam ""trae young"" reddish"
Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish going crazy...let's give it to the guy with a bum ankle every possession
Cam Reddish lead the comeback and he hasn‚Äôt touched it in like 6 possessions lol.
why not let cam reddish take more 3's?
Cam Reddish tried his best to make this a game
Trae needs to stop shooting give it to Cam Reddish
honestly feel like cam reddish should be the only one shooting for the hawks
Look at Cam Reddish so inspirational
"this one is the cam reddish game, that guy has been locked in"
I‚Äôm just happy for Cam Reddish
Cam reddish is a dog
Cam Reddish has been punching Khris every possession go cry me a river
Cam reddish bro you‚Äôre sick
I am officially a Cam Reddish fan
Give us game 7 Cam Reddish pls
Who would have ever thought that Cam Reddish would get further in the playoffs before Zion and RJ
Cam Reddish‚Ä¶puttin da Hawks on his back‚Ä¶.for Madden
Bucks fans crying about refs after not even an hour ago whining about Hawks fans  Maybe dont blow a 20+ point lead to 21 year old Cam Reddish bud
"cam reddish gonna be a legit pg13 successor down the line...once those handles go to another level, my god"
cam reddish randomly decided to be klay thompson tonight
BRO CAM REDDISH HACKS 10 TIMES PER FUCKING POSSESION ON DEFENSE.  Even from compeltely behind Middleton hes reaching around. Where the fucking call?
Cam Reddish is officially on my radar
Cam  Reddish  Iso
Where the hell did this Cam reddish game come from??!
Cam Reddish 6/7 from 3
Cam Reddish of all people is the only one showing up for the Hawks lol
"Cam Reddish, please fuck off with that"
Cam Reddish... my goodness
This is a Cam Reddish Stan account now
Cam Reddish channeling his inner Steph Curry. Damn.
"Alright Alright, how did Cam Reddish, the All Defense Weak Offense player, come back from injury so much better!"
Cam Reddish the only Hawk trynna stay in the playoffs
Wtf did cam reddish do pregame
CAM FUCKING REDDISH IS THE OFFENSE
Is cam reddish the next Kobe?
Not sure of his relationship status but Cam Reddish is definitely getting laid tonight
"This is legit their one shot. You got John ""KG/TD"" Collins from middie, and Cam ""Is he the 3rd Splash Bro?"" Reddish on fire from deep. Just have Trae do his one leg Harden thing by setting them up and let Gallo and Bogie do their thing when they get the rock."
Forgive me Hawks fans for all the Cam Reddish slander.
Cam Reddish about to be in a rap song
"And just like that, Cam Reddish is the high man for the Hawks"
Is this the cam reddish game
Cam Reddish came to play I will say
damn cam reddish is seeing red huh
Cam Reddish just died
"Nah, just point out stupid comments when I see them.  Meanwhile, Bud got rest for Middleton and the rest of the team that had been cooking for a long time without a break, and we kept on making shots (other than PJ Tucker) and kept on winning, even with Cam Reddish randomly putting on his Middleton impression.  But stupid Bud, amirite?  Clearly you know better."
"he has clearly adapted this series and the last, starting with the cam reddish switch from solomon hill and playing the capela/collins/gallo lineup less. we just have less talent than the bucks without deandre hunter and healthy trae, even with giannis out"
"On the bright side of things for the Hawks, Cam Reddish has been looking good all series. He's gonna be good."
I think Cam Reddish was the only one who realized this was an elimination game and came to play.   Shots sometimes don't fall but rebounding this badly is just poor effort. Very disappointed in my team's effort.
Omg Jrue just sent Cam Reddish to cancun
"Cam Reddish nice af, he's gonna be so good"
"Who needs Giannis and Trae when you have Khris ""Michael Jordan"" Middleton and Cam ""Kobe Bryant"" Reddish"
Cam Reddish needs to learn some perspective. Imagine talking shit when you are about to get sent packing.     Just another PatBev but without the tragic haircut.
Where were you when Khris Middleton and Cam Reddish had their epic duel of the century
"I love that Cam Reddish acts like he's just too cool for school out there. Pimping while down 15. Good for you, dude. Fuck reality."
cam reddish flairs won't be faded regardless what happens tonight
Cam Reddish putting the team on his back wow
welcome to the cam reddish show   its the season premier and also the season finale at the same time
"""*I am the offense.*"" - Cam Reddish"
Everyone know a fiend that look like Cam Reddish lol
Cam Reddish carrying the Hawks is an unexpected development.
Cam Reddish vs the Bucks.
We'll miss 1 (one) if you make Cam Reddish stop
Cam Reddish is hoopin
BRO STOP LETTING CAM FUCKING REDDISH JUST HACK US YOU FUCKS.  You cant call it soft for random players.  He reaches and then reaches after the blow by.
"Cam Reddish looks good for the Hawks, Middleton looks better for the Bucks, Trae looks like a man playing with an injury, Hawks are playing sloppy."
Is Cam Reddish a long lost son of Eazy-E?
I think everyone is curious to see what cam reddish is going to be as a player. He‚Äôs an unknown entity. We‚Äôve seen Middleton go off a few times this playoffs so I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs why
I mean‚Ä¶why y‚Äôall dissin cam reddish. Dude has been out injured for months and comes back in his first playoff series-ECF because the hawks need bodies. Hitting random 3s. Let the man live. It‚Äôs kinda nice to see and good for the hawks going into next season  (not a hawks supporter at all)
Bucks up 14 and they‚Äôre showing Cam Reddish going into break LOLOLOLOLOLOL
Middleton went nuclear outscoring the entire hawks team this quarter so far and TNT decides to show cam reddish making wide open threes.  Yup I wonder who they favor....
My Cam Reddish rookie cards are very horny at the moment
Cam Reddish is now the first option for the hawks
"Cam Reddish calm down youngin‚Äô, you can‚Äôt even dribble"
cam newton or cam reddish
Is Cam Reddish shooting threes a new thing?  Love to see his development
"Cam Reddish is such a clown. Barely plays, hits a couple shots and is out here stunting down double digits.  Okay, guy."
"Cam Reddish wakes up the crowd, but then there's Lopez"
So...Cam Reddish is a talker lmfao
Cam Reddish using these playoffs to say I WAS THE OTHER PLAYER IN THE LUKA TRADE BITCH
Cam Reddish is playing really good so far
Someone get Cam Reddish a trophy
"Cam reddish, forever underatted"
Kevin Huerter does not deserve to be playing over cam reddish or someone else. Bringing the hawks down with all his bricks.
Cam Reddish needs to take Kevin‚Äôs spot right now.
It‚Äôs a coin toss between the Nets and Hawks.  Both teams had multiple starters miss multiple games.  The Hawks had more injured players but the Nets had the two best players injured.   The fact that Cam Reddish and Deandre Hunter never played a game together completely crippled the Hawks perimeter defense and is the only reason the 76ers series went 7 games.
"- Cam Reddish wasn‚Äôt healthy enough to play until the last two games of the ECF, then lit it up.   - Deandre Hunter only played the first 5 games of the post season   (Those two are bunched together because ATL was a top 10 defense for the first 20 games of the season before they were injured and not having them in the line up together drastically changes the Hawks defensive identity)   - Bogi was injured and effectively a decoy for the final 4 games of the Philly series and first 2 games of the ECF.  If it were the regular season, he wouldn‚Äôt have played.   - Trae young battled a shoulder injury against Philly and obviously the ankle injury against the Bucks    That‚Äôs 4 out of their 6 or 7 most important players that missed time or were reduced to decoy status because of injury this post season."
"The Hawks statistically had a top 10 defense before Cam and Deandre were injured last year.  If the Hawks are able to consistently roll out line ups with Cam Reddish, Deandre Hunter and Clint Capela in the line up together they will be top 10 offensively and defensively."
If Cam Reddish and Deandre Hunter are on the floor together during the playoffs next year you won‚Äôt be able to attack any part of their defense.
"Yeah old vets like Jamal Murray, divincenzo, deandre hunter, cam reddish, and Donovan Mitchell missing games really hurt those teams that rely on older players"
From what i saw from Reddish i agree. Cam might have a big year next season.
To be honest a healthy Cam Reddish and Deandre Hunter for the Hawks is a bigger upgrade than what the Heat have done.
No lol. Doncic is better than Young and Cam Reddish is not good.
Cam Reddish on trading block.
"If Bulls had put a 1st pick in with Lauri, he'd have been gone at deadline.  Same for if Cam Reddish/1st had been offered."
Celtics getting Cam Reddish
Trae Young   De‚ÄôAndre Hunter   Cam Reddish  John Collins   Jalen Johnson
"It‚Äôs possible to cobble together $9,235,734 of salary filler with Mulder, Paschal, Payton, Smailigic, Lee. The number goes up to $17,976,386 if you include Looney and Moody. Warriors should probably target lower level salary guys who teams don‚Äôt want to extend like Cam Reddish and Aaron Holiday."
If Trae wins 3 rings and Cam Reddish gets hit by a bus ATL won the trade.
If Cam Reddish wins Finals MVP it would be very sad since it means 95% of the NBA would have been lost tragically in some awful natural disaster / cosmic event.
"I think Reddish can improve. I've not dismissed it at all. It is just irrelevant to cite CJ McCollum as a reason this improvement will happen. CJ McCollum grew 2 inches, developed in college, and improved his shooting. Because of this, Cam Reddish, a 6'8"", top prospect, that has been terrible offensively in college and in the pros, will improve? See the false equivalence? I just don't get it, but anyway, I appreciate the discussion!"
"It is rather disingenuous to cite CJ's shooting splits and subsequent improvement in college when he entered as 6'1"" 155 pound 3 star prospect as a reason Cam Reddish will continue to improve. It is just a terrible argument.  Of course Reddish can improve, but his situation is completely different from that of a Lowry or McCollum."
"I don't think comparing Cam to small developmental guards like Lowry or CJ is really accurate. Reddish's shooting numbers are just so terrible, especially for his size and athleticism and he has been awful offensively since college. Ross could at least muster 40% fg his rookie season.   I still think Reddish has potential, but a Ross-like trajectory would be a good outcome for him at this point."
"OP was making the point that shooting poorly pre-NBA is clear evidence they wont shoot well in the NBA. Just because they shot poorly pre-NBA doesnt mean they cant develop a shot in the NBA and came off with the tone that ""it should be obvious.""  For example, Kyle Lowry shot 36% from the field his rookie season (yes I understand Lowry also wasn't a Reddish style HS recruit)  I'm not saying Cam is going to live up to his HS hype of being a future star or anything, but I think there are solid reasonings many people think he'll be a solid NBA player beyond the current struggles or why he shouldnt immediately be written off.  Terrence Ross is another example - he wasn't as highly rated as Reddish was, but by all accounts he was a top 30 HS recruit, had a bad freshman year in college, was a top 10 pick in the draft, and had a pretty terrible first couple years in the NBA. But most people consider him a solid NBA role player at the moment."
"I love how this is upvoted but it feels like a ton of people on this sub reduce guys like Westbrook to strictly TS%. Obv not the same people but it‚Äôs kinda funny watching the sub flip flop between extremes depending on whatever posts get seen.   I think in general many people on this sub didn‚Äôt play at any kind of level, like I‚Äôd wager most guys didn‚Äôt even play in high school. As such this sub is fairly awful at understanding any of the more nuanced things going down. Imo there‚Äôs a reason everyone harps on efficiency and that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the easiest thing to quantitate, however for a lot of the more intangible stuff that just isn‚Äôt possible yet, so people chalk things up to chemistry or something similar and call it a day.  I think Cam Reddish could be great eventually and that Russ is better than his stats for similar (but not the same) reasons, both do things on the court that are harder to directly highlight (defense for Reddish/rebounding+transition play+leadership for Westbrook)."
"It's pretty damned that Cam was a top prospect, bigger, stronger, and more athletic than the vast majority of college players, surrounded by NBA talent and an all-time great coach, and still shot 35% at Duke. I don't think it is appropriate to compare CJ McCollum, a low ranked and undersized 2 guard that needed time to develop at Lehigh, to Cam Reddish. CJ wa 6'1, 155 when he entered college. Cam was supposed to be NBA ready since high school."
I have watched almost every Cam Reddish game since he was 17.  In high school he was unstoppable. He was the lead ball handler and could seriously just get whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. His shot creation was otherworldly. His game was/is just unbelievably smooth.  In college the ball was taken out of his hands and he had a rough time figuring out how to be an off ball player. This is something he still struggles with. He became a very inconsistent shooter but hit some really big shots. He was the best shooter on that Duke team and therefore got used in a C&amp;S role. They were running him off pin downs and he was doing things he's never done and shooting off of brand new actions.   In the NBA Cam has been horribly inconsistent but he has shown some elite flashes. He was incredible for the last couple of months of his rookie year. He fell off the cliff again this past year but returned in the playoffs with some great performances.   It is rumored that Cam is still growing and that could be the source of some of his struggles. He is a 6'9+ wing with a 7'+ wingspan. He is an elite point of attack defender and is only 21 years old. If he can ever get the shot consistent then he is one he'll of a player.
I don't watch enough Cam Reddish to know.
"&gt;already having 1 player makes us better than most teams  Yeah I totally agree, I guess I kind of misinterpreted the point that OP was trying to make. Trae is the distinguishing factor, watching the Hawks' playoff run made that pretty clear. You can't consider your young core on par with theirs until you have a superstar at that level.  That being said, I think the rest of the young talent on the Hornets is at least comparable to the Hawks. Miles Bridges/PJ Washington are similar tier prospects to DeAndre Hunter/Cam Reddish, John Collins is a tier above right now but tbh I have faith that Miles can reach that level of production next season. Possible we lose one of them this summer but Devonte Graham/Malik Monk is a similar level to Kevin Huerter. We're kind of just banking on LaMelo having Trae Young-type progression through his 2nd/3rd season to try and be as competitive as they were but obviously there's no guarantee in that happening."
"As a hawks fan Cam Reddish maybe he played great in the playoffs, Hunter his teammate already was arguably a star before his injury.     I haven't seen many people calling Sexton a star even though he just averaged 25 I think that will change next season but hes a 4th year player.     I can also see Pat Williams breaking out next season but he's still 19 tho so idk"
Cam reddish
"Taking a wild swing and saying Cassius Stanley, but I‚Äôm not sure if he can on the Pacers.  Out of more popular names I say Kevin Porter Jr and Cam Reddish."
lets see if cam reddish can become an actual starting level player then we can talk
"I love this team man. The only thing they need is Trae to adapt. He doesn‚Äôt need to score 27 a game anymore he should be a 22/23 Pof guy and he could literally average 12+ assists per game.   The other thing is cam reddish needs to have a leap. He needs to show them a definitive sign. If he legit puts it all together man that  lineup üò≠   Trae-Hunter-Reddish-Collins-Capela. With Bogi, Huerter, Lou, Gallo, and Okongwu off the bench. Arguably the best starting 5 AND best bench in the league"
Cam Reddish
That‚Äôs what I thought. What about Cam Reddish. I feel like it very well could‚Äôve been him
"Collins is very much attainable for the Spurs imho.  Atlanta is scheduled to pay *a lot* of good young guys the next 3 years they have to pace themselves. They were trying to move Cam Reddish for a younger piece so they could spread the hit to their books out more. If they get hit with a 25-30 million bill for Collins they may decide thats too much since they still need to pay Trae, and Huerter, and Hunter, etc."
**He‚Äôs exactly Mark Jackson 2.0**  - Looks like a nice guy community wise but a bad coach at first  - Created friction between his players(Trae and John) where there was none  - Belittled and bullies Cam Reddish  - Calling John Collins selfish - Telling other coaches to not vote for Trae   He actively held the team back because he was a bad coach plus he created problems when there were none
"It's more to see who is tradable between him, Cam Reddish, oneyka Okungwu, maybe DeAndre Hunter idk.   It may also help them trade away Gallinari in a year or two. Maybe trade away Clint Capela.   To be honest the only guy who is worth the Max is Trae. John Collins is really good but I'm not sure about Max. While Kevin Heurter had a great playoff run he's not Max either. DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish haven't shown themes to top players yet. Well maybe Hunter, but not Cam. Cams been too injured so we've only seen flashes.   We don't know anything about Oneyka Okungwu yet. So it gives options"
I feel like Cooper is going to replace Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish and Knox weren‚Äôt ‚Äòathletic‚Äô tho. Reddish was known as a shooter and Knox an iso scorer. Neither pops off athletically.
"Raw athletic wing players? Off the top of my head: Patrick Williams, Jaylen Brown, Cam Reddish, Kevin Knox."
This kid gonna be good and they can flip cam reddish for future picks depending on how shit goes this year.
Jalen Johnson/ Cam Reddish fight for duke wing
No wonder Hawks want to trade Cam Reddish they basically just got his carbon copy
Sounds a lot like cam reddish who turned out well
cam reddish might be traded
Hawks fans breathe a sigh of relief as it seems that Cam Reddish isn‚Äôt getting traded tonight
I hope we trade back to 20 to get Cam Reddish
"I‚Äôll cheer for whatever wins my team games, idgaf about any emotional attachment some random fan could have to one multimillionaire athlete over another multimillionaire athlete. Unless it‚Äôs cam reddish I have to lose from my team, then I draw a line"
"Hawks fans be like      You trade a potential top 10 player of all time, I can live with that but if you touch Cam Reddish, I'm fucking done with your ass."
Would you possibly consider a Trae Young and Cam Reddish package? I've heard that's fairly valuable.
Trading Cam Reddish to move up a few picks
 I thought Cam Reddish was improving?
Ben Simmons value is closer to Cam Reddish and 20 than the shit Morey‚Äôs asking for üòÇ
"Not who you replied to, but Hawks rumors right now are that they‚Äôre shopping Cam Reddish. I doubt Sixers go for that though. They‚Äôll want more for sure. Maybe Cam and a 2022 2nd round pick?"
"Spurs getting 20,22 Kuzma and Cam Reddish would be ideal for me."
"Honestly the question that makes it difficult is who is the matching salary. You need to be able to send out 30 million bucks worth of dude for Ben Simmons without completely screwing your team post-trade.  For us the matching salary would have to be Aaron Gordon and Will Barton, but like, IDK if I even want to do that trade straight-up, Barton is our starting 2-guard and Aaron Gordon is like 85% of Ben Simmons for 60% of the money. Maybe if the concept is Gordon / JaMychal Green / Zeke Nnaji? IDK, still not even that stoked.  So you kind of have to be like ... who has 30 million bucks worth of slightly overpaid role player that would help the Sixers. Porzingis from Dallas? Cam Reddish and two of (Capela / Gallo / Bogdanovic - who has a trade kicker btw) from Atlanta? Bagley and one of Barnes / Hield from SAC? Hayward from CHA?"
"Yeah I meant after his contract expires, not saying move capela now.  This won‚Äôt fly with hawks fans but I‚Äôd look move bog after this season and essentially pay reddish to replace bog‚Äôs salary. He‚Äôs much older than the core and will be looking for another long term contract in his 30‚Äôs. You could probably get cheaper vets signed long term and a pick for him. Build around Young, KH, Cam, and Collins"
What are the chances the Hawks trade Cam Reddish to move up? If they move up who are they eyeing?
What are the chances the Hawks trade Cam Reddish to move up? If they move up who are they eyeing?
I feel like cam reddish is much better than the average late lottery player so I'm not confident about this trade for the hawks.
"I feel like it is a long, long leap to say Cam Reddish is ""pretty damn good""."
One first. Became Cam Reddish.
I wonder if the Lakers were trying to trade up to get into the lottery so they can flip it for Cam Reddish and 20.
"I think your front office‚Äôs counter argument to that would be something along the lines of that within the next 3 off seasons (counting this current one), all of your key players will be hitting free agency and outside of Gallo will be likely making as much if not more.   Your lineup is currently making X amount and in parentheses is a rough estimate of what the new contracts will be:  Young: $8M ($30M/year on next contract)  Collins: $5M ($30M/year)   Huerter: $4M ($15M/year)  Bog: $18M ($20M-$25M/year)   Hunter: $10M ($30M/year - I legit think he may already be your second best player and if teams are going to toss max offers at Collins, hunter will assuredly face the same issue)   Capela: $20M ($20M/year)  Gallo: $20M ($12M-$15M/year)  Reddish: $5M ($15M-$20M/year, I think he‚Äôll get a Duncan Robinson/Joe Harris type of offer in RFA).  On the low end, if you kept all your current players I think you could see a payroll expand to $170M. It‚Äôs tough trying to sell off players that are about to hit RFA and I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll get full value for a guy like Huerter because teams will be scared into matching high offer sheets. If you draft another center that pans out I think between that guy and OO you could replace most of capela‚Äôs production with 2 rookie scale contracts over the next few years. Gallo is probably the guy that you can afford to let walk in a year or two. And trading cam takes another looming RFA contract off the table. This could get the payroll to a more manageable number over the next few years."
"We should trade cam reddish and the 20th pick to Golden state for klsy Thompsons, straight up. Probably be worth it for the warriors since klay hasn't played basketball in 2 years."
So will Cam reddish be a hawk still by the end of the night?
"This was the blurb under our selection in KOC‚Äôs mock draft:  &gt; ‚ÄúLeague sources say the Hawks have offered the 20th pick with Cam Reddish to teams drafting in the late lottery. The expectation around the league is that Sharpe, a tough big with small-ball 5 potential, would be the target if they make a trade.‚Äù  Hoping he‚Äôs as wrong about this as he was with the ‚ÄúTimberwolves declined an offer of Collins for Beasley and a first round pick‚Äù he put out before the trade deadline"
If you are the Warriors do you trade 14 for Cam Reddish
"Cam Reddish of this class, people marvel at the physical tools when he's trash on offense"
Ben Simmons for cam reddish and Kevin huerter
https://theathletic.com/1040366/2019/06/21/if-anything-he-loves-the-game-too-much-cam-reddish-is-here-for-a-reason/  &amp; my friends seen him at MJQ all the time. If you want you could prolly go right now n see him there. Employees will all tell you he always there
"I don't think anyone's writing him off, but you have to remember that NBA teams don't really have players, they have contracts (at least from the team building perspective, which is what we're talking about here).  Reddish is on a rookie deal now where his pay exceeds his production and is likely to continue to do so, but he has immense athletic potential, which is why he was drafted where he was despite being terrible at Duke.  He's going to be up for an extension soon, likely before he even gets a chance to meet his potential (injuries, which you use as an excuse, are a red flag... hurt for 3 years?).  Reddish's next contract will likely exceed his production because guys with his pedigree tend to get overpaid - Harrison Barnes, Andrew Wiggins, Markelle Fultz, etc... - and therefore he's a good candidate to continue to be a bad contract.  Atlanta has a lot of dudes about to get paid, and they have to have some value contracts.  Value contracts tend to be market distortions from superstars (max salary) and rookies that make positive contributions on rookie deals (salary scale).  The Hawks don't need to jump on any offer, but they'd be smart to gauge his value and get some current/future picks that have a chance to turn into contributors on rookie deals like Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges or Halliburton or similarly lower upside guys who can help a team that has its stars.  Another team in a different position might value Reddish's potential more."
Cam reddish just screams Houston Rockets to me  I dont know why. Team full of ‚Äúhoopers‚Äù
well i‚Äôm not a Thunder fan but probably not‚Ä¶ i also wouldn‚Äôt trade Cam Reddish for a late first doesn‚Äôt really make any sense now   but acting like his value is *more* than that is insane
"Are you suggesting my roster of;   PG - Cole Anthony  SG - Cam Reddish  SF - Josh Jackson  PF - Marvin Bagley  C - Skal Labissiere  Isn‚Äôt going to win 5 straight titles?   But yeah in all reality, so many guys that are just athletic 6‚Äô7 or taller guys are dominant high school players because no one can match their size/speed. Once they play higher level and everyone is that fast/big it‚Äôs more based on their skills, so how good they were compared to other 16-17 year olds doesn‚Äôt matter."
What assets do you expect Cam Reddish to be worth if he can‚Äôt even make the rotation of the team he‚Äôs on? It‚Äôs called ‚Äúbuy low‚Äù
Houston rockets get on it  KPJ Jalen green Cam reddish  Pf  Christian wood  All hype beast team would be fun to see
"Nobody gets people to freak out over him whenever he drops 15 points in a game like Cam Reddish. Will never get the fetishizing. People who say he's young and can improve alot youre right.....him improving alot would mean him just being an ok middle of the pack player. Because he was one of the worst starters in the NBA last yr, hasnt been good since high school and gets hurt a fair bit."
Cam Reddish
Both teams made out fine but Young has super star potential when Luka already is a super star. I'm not sure a Cam Reddish throw in makes up that much ground
"Minnesota Draft History since timberpups era began with a solid vet lineup  2020: Ant -1  2019: Culver - 6 (next SG/SF picks: Cam Reddish, Cam Johnson, Tyler Herro)  2018: Okogie - 20  2017: Justin Patton - 16 *had KAT (next SF/PF picks: Leaf, Collins, OG, DJ Wilson but that was even dumber)  2016: Dunn - 5 *had Rubio (next SG picks: Buddy, Murray) ... but also thibs kept trying to play LaVine at PG too  2015: KAT -1  2014: LaVine - 13, Wiggins - 1 *traded for Love  vets: Rubio, KG, Kevin Martin, Andre Miller, Tayshaun Prince, Pek  pups: Shabazz Muhammad, Dieng"
or the hawks giving away luka for trae young and cam reddish.
"Hawks fans are high on Cam Reddish because he's what they got for Luka. If he's a zero, they have to admit they lost the Luka for Trae Young swap."
"Players drafted after Culver that may be better than Culver :   Coby White, Hachimura, Cam Johnson, Cam Reddish, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro, NAW, Okeke, Sekou, Goga, Bazley, Poole, Keldon Johnson, KPJ, Paschall, THT"
Cam Reddish. He sucks. Like he‚Äôs not a good player. He had 1 great playoff game. I don‚Äôt care about the narrative that Lloyd Pierce was ‚Äúbullying‚Äù him. I first of all don‚Äôt think that happened and it also indicates that Reddish has a fragile ego. Nobody should be trading a top 14 pick for Reddish.
"Lol Bamba, WCJ, Sexton, and Knox were the 6th-9th picks. I maintain, that would've been a bad trade at the time, and a horrendous trade now. The Hawks got crucified on draft night for trading down to Trae Young (and Cam Reddish eventually). It would've been a lot worse."
Cam Reddish is the promised land to Hawks fans.  If he reaches what hes shown flashes of then the Hawks literally drafted a championship.
I wasn't ready for Hawks fans to still be this high on Cam Reddish  Pistons fans seem pretty high on Killian Hayes when I'm not even sure he's an NBA player
Cam Reddish üò§
"What has Cam Reddish shown to be worthy of being traded for a lottery pick in this year‚Äôs draft? 1 great playoff game? I would prefer whoever is the top 14 in this draft over Cam Reddish. Reddish has shown to be even more raw than people anticipated coming out of college. He‚Äôs tools with very little results. I think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect he‚Äôll be a better 3 point shooter in the future but the results are what they are right now, and they are not pretty."
"It's amazing to me that we have literal official NBA combine measurements for 95% of players in the NBA and people still overexaggerate the shit out of heights and wingspans. Cam Reddish is 6'8 WITH shoes (6'6.5 without).  I hear it frequently on podcasts too, especially when people are talking about the draft. ""XYZ player has good length, 6'6, etc."" Go to their measurements - 6'4 with a 6'5 wingspan. Like why do people talk out of their asses so much? lol"
"Pels would have Zion, NAW, Jaxson Hayes and Reddish all come up for extensions at the same time. I don‚Äôt think the Pels with go after Cam for that reason."
Tell me you know nothing about Cam Reddish without telling me you know nothing about Cam Reddish
Hi I‚Äôd like a cam reddish please
Cam Reddish
"Eric Gordon plus a first for a sign and trade for Oubre - also heard maybe Cam Reddish or Deandre Hunter plus picks for a sign and trade.  Could also see Cleveland going for Paschall plus 14 for Sexton, as they don‚Äôt want to give him the max and would want a pick to continue rebuilding. They would get a low return but may view it as better than letting him walk in free agency. This is a dream trade"
He‚Äôs like Cam Reddish. The talent is there but is inconsistent and makes mental mistakes. Also both are very young.
We snagged KPJ  If we can somehow snag Cam Reddish for some picks
"Send Reddish to Phoenix so when they refer to the bench they can just say ""Cam"""
Really?  Do people hate him.  He seemed pretty decent if not inconsistent due to injuries and better guys ahead of him.  He‚Äôs much worth it to take a flyer on.  Like I‚Äôd gladly give up the 8th pick for a Cam Reddish because at least I know he‚Äôs a low end starting wing.
"no shit lmao we sure could use a cam reddish right about now, as that's exactly the player archetype we're specifically missing. high upside 6'8"" with good defense. sure that's what everyone wants but we don't even have Rudy gay anymore lol"
"Damn, some of y'all really in your feelings about Cam Reddish lmao"
"Cam Reddish is the most overrated youngster in the NBA, the prime example of people thinking that potential plays  Potential doesn't play games"
Cam Reddish either has the biggest dick in the world or he is worse than Mike Bibby. There is no middle ground.
"At least the Hawks got a good player out of it, but yeah, Mavs probably couldn't believe their luck to leverage a number 5 pick plus whatever else they traded to move up and ending up with Luka (looked it up, it was the future pick that eventually became Cam Reddish, lmao, even funnier)."
"nah celtics fucked it, had all those picks and mismangaged the assets. Celtics wont be a top team, yeah you got jaylen and tatum but other than that you aint shit else coming up. Suns not really cp3 is old a.f whos going to replace that, nets are the present will KD be injury free for the next 3-4 years? Only one i agree with is the Nuggets Jokic,Murray, and MpJ are pretty young and still on the comeup. They draft well and have a good good of talented players. The other two teams are Atlanta and Memphis, Atlanta has alot of young talent proably the most in the league, high draft picks, they had the 6th pick in 2019, year before that they got cam reddish, if he can be a 15ppg player on like 43-45% efficancy that would make it pretty tough to deal with."
Development of Cam Reddish.  He's entering his 3rd year and his progress/development this year is going to be a big tell on whether we keep him long term or look else where. We know his potential but we need to see him get some consistency going more than anything else.
Deandre Hunter Cam reddish
And also Cam Reddish not being good basically gave him more minutes to shine
Jordan Poole Patrick Williams RJ Barrett Cam Reddish Jaren Jackson
"Hawks fan. Not really.  Bogi has a player option next year so that's 19 mil in cap space and I get a strong feeling he's going to decline because he's got one or two more paydays left. If cam shows that he's worth 15 or 16 mil a year, that makes bogi a luxury. If cam doesn't figure it out, he's not worth 6 mil to the hawks and likely needs a change of scenery. Reddish is a solid defensive wing that can't really shoot and seems to want to drive without a plan too often. That's a bad player. The hawks need to see some improvement from him in terms of being willing to accept the 3 and d role when he's out with the starters, and playing in control otherwise. He's also 21 and has guys like steph in his corner saying he's awesome so we're hopeful he figures it out."
With this contract extension.   This team is going to be same team for three straight years before guys are moved.   For the sake of the cap I can see Schlenk potentially postpone Deandre Hunter and Cam Reddish contract talks till the following year to handle Bogi and Gallo's contract before having to break up this roster.   So there solid year of consistent play and team chemistry.
Cam Reddish gone right?
Very young players only  Davion Mitchell Lu Dort Cam Reddish Scottie Barnes Evan Mobley
All fun and games till cam reddish and deandre hunter start creating their own shot
"Under Nate McMillan, they went 27-11 with the same roster that Pierce went 14-20 with. So I think 50 wins is not unlikely.  Also, McMillan should have been coach of the year on that record disparity alone. On top of it, he didn't even have Cam Reddish or De'Andre Hunter."
Cam Reddish didn‚Äôt get hurt
So did Cam Reddish
You mean cam reddish isn't the next Paul George?
Can will have a decent game once every 5 games and the top comment in each of those threads will be    ‚Äúlmao where are the Cam Reddish doubters now‚Äù  and then he‚Äôll be terrible the next 4 games until the cycle repeats itself
People think cam reddish will be good based on what? He‚Äôs been legitimately awful since high school
Hot take but cam reddish will be closer to being out of the rotation by January than he will be some breakout candidate
"The Hawks are ridiculously deep. They have players like Lou Williams, Kevin Huerter, and Danilo Gallinari off the bench who would get quality/starter mins and usage on some other teams. I‚Äôm not even including everyone‚Äôs favorite prospect Cam Reddish."
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"Dude don‚Äôt even start with this, no team can complain to the Hawks about injuries.  Against the 76ers the Hawks didn‚Äôt have Cam Reddish or Deandre Hunter, their only two good perimeter defenders.  That is the only reason this series went 7 games.   Bogi was so injured that he was a complete decoy.  All he good do was take up space.  Even though he didn‚Äôt miss any of the games, Trae was also having a lot of issues with his shoulder.     The Hawks post season run cannot be discredited because of injuries.  They were arguably more injured than any team in the playoffs."
Cam Reddish anyone?
Cam Reddish
Really we using DG as an escuse? How about the fact the hawks didn‚Äôt have deandre hunter or cam reddish for the whole series?
"Hunter is better than Danny Green and missed the entire series. A 1 seed being down their 5th best player losing to a 5 seed being down their 2nd or 3rd best player is still very embarrassing.  Also cam reddish missed the whole series, not that he is amazing, but he's the guy who should've taken Hunter's minutes. Instead we played Gallinari at the 3 and somehow won lol"
No cam reddish?  Are you delusional?!
"Cam Reddish, Malik Monk, Justice Winslow, Kris Dunn, Mo Bamba, Lonnie Walker, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr., and Kyle Kuzma. I think Kuzma is going to be at least mentioned in all-star considerations being Washginton's second option.  There's the obvious choices that everyone won't shut up about like OG, Poole, and Herro, and their fanbases are being so obnoxious about then that I kinda want them to fail. Less Herro than the other two since he already had his hype a year ago."
Cam Reddish
"I know im a hawks fan but I think we might take the cake.  Our 2nd unit will be some combo of:  PG: Delon Wright/lou Williams  SG: Kevin huerter  SF: Cam Reddish  PF: Gallo  C: OO/Gorgui Deing  Then we have Jalen johnson, Solomon hill and sharife cooper to back those guys up"
"Almost as if Cam Reddish so far hasn't looked good at all, so including him in the equation doesn't have any impact on the outcome"
Well i woulda said Okongwu but he‚Äôll be out for a while :(   The answer is definitely Cam Reddish
"Nah this is absurd.   Firstly, salary cap is a thing. But in this instance its two things. Both in that we have to match and then have $38m/yr of rotting Bum Simmons on the team.  Cam is shooting 72.7% from 3 his entire time under McMillan. People are waking up to the value/potential that Reddish really has offensively, and not many realize he's been Hawks best perimeter defender for 3 years now  ... at the very least its Delon, Cam, Gallo and 1 protected 1st or we need to start demanding they throw Thybulle too.  The opportunity cost of fleshing out Reddish's career under a coach that doesn't literally hate him is too great"
"without a doubt. i mean.. cmon now, we have Cam (the goat) reddish"
What do ya‚Äôll think of cam reddish
Cam Reddish
On the Hawks sub? That place of extremely serious basketball discourse? The only thing surprising is that no one ranked him as 7th behind Cam Reddish 6X.
"Not in terms of potential, he wasn‚Äôt. He was hyped in terms of flashiness with dunks and athleticism. RJ Barrett was seen as the best player in the 2018 high school class and Cam Reddish and Zion were seen as interchangeable on a lot of recruiting rankings."
"This reminds me of Zion's Duke dunk when Cam Reddish threw the lob too high, but Zion caught it anyways.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_c8mmoSls4s"

"Other teams will cower in fear as an 8'1"" Cam Reddish walks out of the locker room, supercharged after his 19th dose of the Moderna shot."
"Embiid, Trae, Cade, Duncan Robinson, Cam Reddish"
"I agree the depth of the Sixers is better, but a lot of those Sixers team was mostly comprised of G-Leaguers that aren‚Äôt in the NBA anymore either so it might not be a huge difference. Especially with a team like 2019 Duke,  it‚Äôs possible the star power could win out. Like that team had Grayson Allen, Zion, Cam Reddish, and RJ Barrett. Even though the bench sucks, they could definitely compete with those Sixers teams."
"Damian Lillard $5   Duncan Robinson $2   Cam Reddish $1   OG Anunoby $2    Anthony Davis $5     Pretty simple- if you are building for a championship window, you need to plan for playoff basketball.  Prioritizing a spread PnR with a stout defense and a dominant offensive engine guard and defensive anchor big.  The Lillard/AD two man game would be unstoppable, with shooters on the wing who can help without too many touches on offense, being pluses on the other end."
"Cam Reddish. I feel like this is his year to shine. If he does have his break out year, then he stays and maybe makes it to the starting 5, and hopefully achieves his potential. If he disappoints, I hate to say it, but he might get traded."

"Nikeil Alexander Walker, Killian Hayes, Deangelo Russell (people know he‚Äôs good but he‚Äôs been passed around a lot because no one thinks they can win with him), Cam Reddish, Tyler Herro, Colin Sexton, Markelle Fultz."

Cam Reddish dropped 20 against the champs and NBA fans decided he was better almost immediately üò≠ the way RJ gets disrespected is sickening
"I mean besides Trae and Cam Reddish, it has looked like no one on our team gives a flying fuck about any facet of the game."
Wanted for double homicide on cam reddish. Those 2 blocks were nba jam like
"I think I saw Matisse Thybulle toss the ball 5 or 6 rows in the stands and he wasn‚Äôt ejected.   But I won‚Äôt mention that, cuz I don‚Äôt want to embarrass the league (or Cam Reddish)"
I have a feeling I will be kicking myself for not putting my actual hard earned dollars on Cam Reddish for MIP. What a promising player!
"And cam reddish, and deandre hunter and OG, and batum... the list is long if you are out of shape (comming from a slovene) and uninterested."
"Uh, Kristaps didn't even play tonight and Luka still got clamped by Gordon. His poor condition and insistence of running Iso is becoming more predictable in his 4th season. Luka is too crafty for this to completely shut him out of games, but when he gets tired or frustrated and been facing good defenders all day like Gordon or Cam and Reddish on opening day then the Mavs offense becomes stagnant and the others making half of their shots aren't going to fix that especially against a good team."
"2017 - John Collins  2018 - Trae Young, Kevin Huerter  2019 - Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish  2020 - Onyeka Okongwu  2021 - Jalen Johnson, Sharife Cooper  &amp;#x200B;  Obviously I'm biased but I'd say the Hawks have drafted better. Every single one of the guys on this list has starter level upside (if they haven't realized it yet) and are going to cause a money squeeze on the Hawks because of how good they all are. The Grizz probably have picked guys better equipped to be rotation and role guys but the Hawks seem to have a lot of guys who would be on a lot of team's starting lineups"
I may or may not be biased because I was a De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish stan when they were coming out of the draft and they've looked great to start the season.
"The reason why Hawks are shooting terribly is because they are shooting a huge amount of off balanced and contested jumpers, not even 3s but just twos. Like why is Cam Reddish shooting fadeaways breh"
cam reddish of the bucks?
this is hard to listen to. This marv albert guy has made three major errors while commentating so far. He just explained how Cam Reddish of the Milwaukee Bucks deflected the ball out of bounds.
Bucks legend Cam Reddish
Marv needs to go‚Ä¶. he just said Cam Reddish is on the Bucks lol
"I think the only SF who could possibly be in a position to win FMPV is Middleton.  Neither the Hawks nor the Suns rely much on their SFs.  So that seems likely, unless Cam Reddish ascends to the title of GOAT in the finals suddenly."
Cam Reddish finals mvp season
"I would play Okongwu, the guy that's clearly been their best big man literally every single time they put him on the floor.   Okongwu and Cam Reddish are the most mind-numbingly underplayed guys on that team. I know Reddish supposedly has a minutes restriction or whatever, but those two instantaneously make a massive impact every time they touch the floor. Okongwu was the same way in the 6ers series."
Maybe Trae Young and Cam Reddish for Luka
I never bought into Cam Reddish but he‚Äôs starting to show me some great signs
I don't know how Cam Reddish got that reputation already but he's been grabbing guys all over the place with no foul calls.
i don‚Äôt wanna hate but cam reddish is a very frustrating player to watch. he should not be getting minutes in this series. he‚Äôs playing atrociously.
Minute restrictions in the WCF is so stupid. Play Cam Reddish the rest of the game.
Bro cam reddish is becoming a star
Cam Reddish is my dad
"You might be thinking of R.J. Barrett, Cam Reddish‚Äô teammate at Duke. But Barrett looked pretty good this year for the Knicks imo."
So how good is Cam Reddish?  Was LP holding him back that much?  It's like he's a totally different player now.
John Collins has a shorter wingspan than Cam Reddish.
I still believe in Cam Reddish
I love Cam Reddish
Lol some idiot both teams are missing their stars. Cam reddish is right there smh
Trust me cam reddish is gonna be a top 15 nba player soon
Cam Reddish is a gem
Cam ‚ÄúPaul George‚Äù Reddish
I love Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish is nice
nice to see cam reddish contributing. he had a lot of hype out of highschool has not lived up to it so far.
"Bobby Portis, Bryn Forbes, Pat Connaughton, and Thanasis all on the floor for Milwaukee while Atlanta has Solomon Hill, Okongwu, Kris Dunn, and Cam Reddish to close the quarter (while already down 15)  These are the best playoffs ever, I love when the conference finals feel like a preseason game!"
"It wasn't a case of talent, it was a case of the worst spacing you've ever seen. You could've added some random guy who only sits in the corner and shoots threes and they would've been a better team. Instead they had Cam Reddish who sat in the corner and only missed threes"
Cam reddish got the handles of a 5th grader
a hawks fan told me that cam reddish would be the third best player on the lakers lmao
Prediction: Cam Reddish and OO will have the best games of their careers tonight.
CAM REDDISH MASTERCLASS PART 2!
Only reason I‚Äôm watching tonight is for Cam Reddish vs the world
If you think he‚Äôs good at player relationships you haven‚Äôt been paying attention  Instigated beef between Trae and Collins Advocated against Trae to be an All Star Bullied Cam Reddish at practice Consistently sat Okongwu for Fernando  And that‚Äôs just the stuff that has come out
Cam Reddish will shut CP3 down. Hawks in four.
It's going to get Cam Reddish a huge contract when he blocks Paul ten times in the finals.
Cam Reddish watching CP3 tape tonight. Be afraid.
Cam Reddish
"It's nuts how deep the Suns roster is. They have great flexibility across positions and can withstand missing key contributors if needed. They had 9 players play major minutes this off-season so far: Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Crowder, CP3, Payne, Cam Johnson, Craig, and Saric. And even beyond that, they have guys who could act as a solid stopgaps, with Nader returning halfway through the off-season, E'Twaun Moore, Kaminsky, and Jevon Carter (surprised he didn't get more time). The only real role they don't have redundancy is at center, where Saric (and maybe Crowder) could play small ball 5 but it's better if he doesn't do it for too long. Luckily, Ayton's been healthy and great in the playoffs. Payne has filled in for CP3 decently, Booker's scoring could be covered piecemeal (with drawbacks of course), and they have solid defenders across the board, especially at the wing.  I think this is a big difference between the Suns and Hawks roster construction with say, the Jazz or the Bucks. Bucks sacrificed their depth for Holiday and losing Donte (and now, Giannis) hurt them a disproportionate amount. Losing a role player (or even a star) in this injury-filled playoffs impacts a deep team a lot less, and teams with players on great contracts (both the Suns and Hawks have most of their important players on rookie contracts) can take more blows to their roster. For the Jazz, the top 8 played great but Niang and below couldn't be trusted and there wasn't lineup flexibility (no viable small ball 5, much less playmaking once Conley got hurt, worse scoring by quite a bit if Mitchell sits). Even the Clippers, who lost Ibaka before the playoffs started, Kawhi halfway through, and finally Zubac, played hard and stayed competitive up until they lost too many players because they had a really deep roster, too (and Mann stepped up).  Getting solid performers for cheap also helps a lot. The Suns got Torrey Craig for literally just cash and a TPE. Decent end of bench options are all on mins (or close to it): Payne, Nader, Moore, Galloway, Kaminsky, and Craig. Ayton's still on his rookie contract. Crowder at &lt;$10M/yr is a steal.   For the Hawks, Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Collins, Huerter, and Okongwu are all looking great and on rookie contracts, giving them plenty of cap to sign decent vets  like Gallo, Bogdan, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. (Also, that's 11 solid options most teams would be happy to have in a playoff rotation, hence why they could weather injuries to Trae, Hunter, Reddish, and Bogdanovic so far.)  For both these teams, they have very few wasted roster spots. The Suns' worst player at the moment is probably Jalen Smith, while the Hawks have Bruno Fernando and Brandon Goodwin. (Heck, Mays and Knight are solid.) Still, they take up very little cap. Goes to show how far prudent cap management can go.   TL;DR: James Jones and Travis Schlenk did a great job with these rosters."
"Sorry Hawks, Trae Young, Cam Reddish, Kevin Huerter, John Collins, other young players I can't remember; they've all peaked. The only way is down from here."
"Cam reddish is better than Beverly I promise, plus we can actually make shots better than the clippers and have a better all around team if Trae is healthy"
Cam Reddish will lock up those frauds
It‚Äôll depend heavily on what Middleton can contribute and Cam Reddish guarding him might give him some headaches. Perimeter defense has been the Hawks‚Äô weakness the whole postseason and Reddish returning solves a lot of those problems. I still expect a close one though.
Hawks with a Cam Reddish 35 piece
Hawks led by Cam Reddish
Had the best record in the East under Nate mcmillian and that was with missing deandre hunter and cam reddish. Deandre hunter was arguably the hawks best player early in the season and was carrying them to wins when Trae started off slow
can't leave out that cam reddish smile
Khris Middleton will be a major factor but I think it‚Äôs worrisome for the Bucks that Cam Reddish is back now because he has the ability to keep Middleton‚Äôs offense in check. The Hawks‚Äô biggest weakness this postseason has been perimeter defense and Reddish being back in the mix is a huge boost for them.
"Cam Reddish being in the game solves the Hawks biggest weakness the last two series: perimeter defense.   He has guarded KD, Lebron, Kyrie and others effectively this year and will be able to limit Middletons effectiveness. The Hawks need good offensive production from some combination of Bogi, Lou, Heurter and Gallo.  Any offense they get from Cam is a bonus.  Capela is also questionable.  But honestly Onyeka has arguably been playing better than him the last few games.  But most importantly the Hawks are more mentally tough than the Bucks and they don‚Äôt lose close games.  The Bucks won‚Äôt be blowing them out without Giannis so I say Hawks in 6."
Cam Reddish
LP ruining the development of a young player?! He would never‚Ä¶*looks at Cam Reddish*
Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish isnt even getting started.   Deandre Hunter isnt even gettin started.  Huerter hasnt unlocked his final form  Bogi is only 28  Capela is only 27  This is a dynasty
Cam Reddish
Implying Cam Reddish isn't a top 10 player üôÑ
Cam Reddish??
Lol I keep seeing people say this.  There is no chance in hell the Bucks win this series now.  They won‚Äôt win another game much less the series.  Even without Trae.  Cam Reddish coming back and being a foil for Middleton and Bogi saying his leg felt better and then showing that he can drop 20 on any given night again spells the end for the Bucks.
Cam Reddish FMVP  Cam Reddish FMVP  Cam Reddish FMVP
"Underrated is Cam reddish, i see his haircut on barber shop pages all the time."
"Here's the scary thing.  Cam Reddish is back, Bogi is back and Trae Young will most likely be back and now Giannis is out.  If Giannis is out for the rest of the series or only at 70% the Bucks might be heading for a vacation."
"Well, let's put this into perspective.  Bogi is new, Gallo has always been a plus player.  John Collins is versatile but not dominant at any one thing.  Cam Reddish and Hunter are in their 2nd yrs.  Add to that with no national exposure and you have the current recipe of talent with no recognition.  Four weeks ago, people were laughing at Trae Young being called a star.  To put it in prospective, even Ja Morant didn't make the teams.  Young players normally don't get proper recognition."
At this rate we‚Äôre going to watch cam reddish hold up the finals MVP
"Suns if Cam Payne keeps playing at this level, Hawks if Cam Reddish makes a leap in scoring."
Was Cam Reddish the throw in player (draft pick) in the Luka trade?
"They have Bogdan who can create and space the floor. The Hawks need DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish to stay healthy, improve their skills, and earn the trust of the next coach."
In the ballislife universe Cam Reddish is absolutely the best player on this Hawks team lol. I still hope he turns it on in the league man.
Even though he's playing now. You could also maybe add Cam Reddish to the list. He was out the first two series.
Are you assuming that Cam Reddish isn't our best player?
Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish
"I can tell you didn‚Äôt watch the game. The reason the defense was amazing last night was because Coach Nate finally played Cam Reddish who is an elite defender in this league, and he played OO more minutes who is our best defender against Giannis. You really think Lou Williams is any better at defense that Trae lmao?"
"You do realize that Trae Young was out this game right?  Cam Reddish and Deandre Hunter have been out and they were both starters at the start of the season?  but you wouldn't know that since your just making excuses.    If the Bucks had won this game, they would be going to the finals."
Cam Reddish and De'andre Hunter are without a doubt the best players in the 2019 draft and it's not even close
We got Cam and Reddish out there? How the fuck are opposing teams scoring
Cam reddish tryna catch a federal charge listening to Young Boy while working out
"Cam Reddish is a boom or bust type of guy with questionable shot selection but insane physical tools and very good defense. Hawks fans are overall way too high on him.   Kevin Huerter is a younger bogdan essentially with worse defense at this point in his career. Decent playmaking/shot creation potential, and already a knockdown shooter."
What is your opinion of Huerter and Cam Reddish?
Don‚Äôt forget C-C-CAM REDDISH!
Cam Reddish future GOAT confirmed
"The Hawks hit gold in the 2017-2019 drafts.  * John Collins (2017, 19th pick) * Trae Young (2018, 5th pick) * Kevin Huerter (2018, 19th pick) * De'Andre Hunter (2019, 4th pick, moved up by trading up with New Orleans) * Cam Reddish (2019, 10th pick, obtained from Luka Traed) * Onyeka Okongwu (2020, 6th pick, TBD how valuable of a contributor he can be)  Getting Taurean Prince (12th pick) and De'Andre Bembry (21st pick) in 2016 could have gone worse, too. Real minefield in that draft, with Papagiannis (13th), Yabusele (16th), Baldwin (17th), Ellenson (18th), Malachi Richardson (22nd), Zizic (23rd), Brice Johnson (25th) lurking. That doesn't even include Dragan Bender (4th), Kris Dunn (5th), Marquese Chriss (8th), and Thon Maker (10th). Bruno Fernando has been a letdown, but he was the 34th pick, so expectations can't be too high.  And somehow, they have positive draft capital moving forward (i.e. didn't sacrifice their picks unnecessarily).  Having all these guys on rookie deals means they were able to sign or acquire a bunch of vets to fill in their roster holes: Gallinari, Bogdanovic, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. Their cap also allowed them to act as cap relief for other teams. Schlenk has done wonders for this team since his 2017 arrival. He apparently also scouted Draymond when he was working for the Warriors."
"What a misconception of the media. This analyst watches every team because it's their job. He consulted with his colleague John Hollinger who lives in Atlanta and frequently attends Hawks games and is pretty pro Hawks, as well as coaches and executives from around the league. And the only reason I mentioned the media is that you disagree with my initial position and said no one would share it, which is obviously wrong at its face.   Media and scouts didn't give Cam Reddish his 9.36 PER. He earned that by playing like ass. The media didn't make him shoot 36.5% which is almost difficult to fathom. Who has Cam Reddish proven wrong except the foolish players who once called him most talented?  Perhaps you the Atlanta Hawks homer is wrong and me, legions of NBA scouts tracking this and the inconvertible numbers are right. You are such a homer that you are advocating for an impossibility for the one Hawks player who has shown basically zero growth this year. That's how homer-ish you are. You can't even admit to yourself that Reddish was a massive disappointment this year before he got injured.  It's brutally hard to make the all star team. Trae should have made it this year over Simmons and Sabonis, but didn't. In most years, he would have. But either way, a player as talented and productive as Trae is fighting for spots 8 through 12. Cam Reddish is like six levels below Trae. Cam Reddish would have to make a leap that no player in NBA history has made to make it to an all star team.  You are just being an idiot, go back to watching youtube mix tapes and stop with this goo goo ga ga shit. 36.5% shooting in his second year has no shot. Zero."
"0 for 2, Lou Will is not a difference maker vs Trae. Cam reddish was vs Solomon Hill..."
"Hawks take is absolutely not sensible, Lou Williams is the exact same.  Cam Reddish playing tonight was the difference."
Reddish who? Cam Johnson all day baby.
not even the best Cam in the series honestly.  [Reddish Hype]
"The Cam Reddish, Kevin Huerter disrespect üò§"
"Hawks did the luka trade for cam reddish, trae just came on the side"
"With Cam Reddish back on the floor, their defense drastically increased"
"So trae is SLANDERED on his defense, it really has improved from last year but you will never hear it mentioned. He gets steals, and even doubles centers well (see embiid a few times). he also hawks passing lanes to make up for lack of size. BUT despite all this, the hawks scheme a defense entirely around trae in making sure he‚Äôs hidden in the corner guarding the ‚Äúpj tuckers‚Äù of the world so he can‚Äôt really be taken advantage of. So the lack of having to scheme trae into the defense empowers the other hawk defenders to play a simplified man defense where some of them really shine, see Kevin huerter, cam reddish, Clint capela, and deandre hunter (when he gets a new knee). This obviously helps the hawks defend especially against star players like giannis. The clippers part is just stupid and doesn‚Äôt even dignify a response. Sorry bro"
9'10 Cam Reddish is a scary sight indeed...
"John Collins, Kevin Huerter, and Cam Reddish outworked the entire Bucks team tonight. Bogi and Lou Will provided much needed buckets. OO is the best Giannis defender in NBA? HAWKS IN SIX!"
Cam Reddish is on that Tony Tony Chopper 3 Rumble Ball ish
"Imagine you‚Äôre an eastern conference GM. After 12 years of Lebron just murdering any Hope you have of doing anything, you finally catch a break when he goes to the Lakers. Then, two years later, you watch in horror as you realize that an 8‚Äô4‚Äù Cam Reddish is going to own the East for the next decade."
"On paper, Jrue and Middleton are the best players on the floor but a healthier Bogi, more active Capela and a blossoming Cam Reddish playing major minutes are things that they didn't have to deal with early on in the series. I think it's pretty evenly matched"
MAVS LOST THE CAM REDDISH TRADE
The hawks 2nd best player (Hunter) and best premiter defender has missed the last two rounds.  Cam reddish just returned after missing the first 2 rounds bogdanovic is playing hurt and trae just missed a game.  No its not.
It'll be Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish
OG Anunoby great 3&amp;D wing who fits perfectly in the Nuggets timeline   And the 2nd I‚Äôd go with Cam Reddish 1 because I think he‚Äôs going to be a ridiculously good 3&amp;D guy in a year maybe 2 and I said during the draft he would be the best player from his class by the time all their careers are said and done 2. he‚Äôs one of my favorite players in the NBA
Cam reddish for sure lmao *clamp reddish
Cam Reddish
"I mean, there's always the DAL vs ATL scenario which plays out where both players end up being great. Hawks were confident in Trae Young and were able to draft him while getting another young piece in Cam Reddish."
"Second half of the lottery probably?   Zion, Ja, Barrett, and Garland would be top 4.  The rest of the lottery would probably be (in some order): DeAndre Hunter, Coby White, Tyler Herro, PJ Washington, Matisse Thybulle, Cam Johnson, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr., Jordan Poole, Rui Hachimura. Maybe throw in Gafford or Clarke or Reddish or someone else instead.  Pretty weak draft so far, looking back on it."
The price of the brick is goin up. Trae hasn‚Äôt got his max deal yet. Cam reddish looked like a created player out there. He‚Äôs like 6‚Äô10 now he‚Äôs a max player soon. Deandre Hunter is looking like Kawhi lite he‚Äôs gonna be a near max player. They‚Äôre gonna near-max John Collins. Shooters get paid Huerter is gonna command big money. Bogi locked in 3 more years. They HAVE TO  start making trades that‚Äôs not even debatable. Bogi already said it. It either true or let guys walk. So their motivation would be to get ahead of it
"The Hawks aren't blowing up their team for Bradley Beal. They're especially not trading De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish, who both have star potential"
"Cam Reddish will average 36 points, 8 steals, 5 blocks, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists in an MVP+FMVP season. Book it and take that bet to Vegas"
"Keeping in Willis territory, there is an even bigger age difference between Willis (9/6/62) and Cam Reddish (9/1/99).  Both of them played with Vince Carter."
Trae was injured and DeAndre hunter and cam reddish
"You really left out rj barrett in the 2019 class like he didn‚Äôt just put up 18, 5,3 as the second guy on a 4th seed. I genuinely wanna know what was going through your head when you put Tyler hero and cam reddish over rj?"
"The crazy thing for us is Huerter Gallo and Lou aren't even our 5-7 best players they are 6-8 or 7-9 depending on how you view Cam Reddish.  Both Reddish and Hunter had multiple fantastic games this season, but didn't quite make the list due to injury."
"Nah no way hawks are letting go of cam reddish lol. guy just had a good playoff game, just basically showed what he's capable of. no way they let go of him"
"If we could trade 10 &amp; Bledsoe, and then like 10 2nd rd picks to get Cam Reddish, I'm fine keeping the rest of the team from last season."
"There will be tons of shitty trades with shit draft picks for some of the Hawks bright young talent.   For instance, The athletic talked about a trade with \#10 pick with the pelicans being used to trade for Cam reddish.   While our city maybe cursed sports wise. We aren't that fucking dumb. If you want players like Cam or JC or Huerter then post actual legit traded involving multiple unprotected draft picks even tho likely scenario is that we won't trade them unless needed."
"As a Knicks fan, I would like to log a complaint:   * RJ Barrett needs to replace Cam Reddish on the '19 team  Aside from that, great job OP. This is really good creative post"
Dukes Young Core  Cam Reddish  RJ Barrett  Jayson Tatum  Zion Williamson  Wendell Carter Jr
Cam Reddish
"""He gonna be a star""  -KD on Cam Reddish"
"Lol what. Trae???, bogdan knee, cam reddish coming back from injury , deandre hunter their best defender not even playing the entire series"
"I'm drafting top 10 in a deep draft. It's not like I don't have a draft pick and have to go searching for veterans as my only option.    I have Zion who's 21 and can create his own shot. Brandon Ingram who's 23 and can create his own shot. NAW who is getting better and better as a combo guard with starting or 6th man potential who can also get his own shot and is 22. Already have a future big in Jaxson Hayes. Also have Lonzo and Josh Hart who are RFAs we can resign. I have no need to draft a guy with a high potential like a Moses Moody or a Keon Johnson or someone one &amp; done that will sit on the bench because he can't utilize a discernible skill right away to get on the court next to Zion or BI or over Hart/NAW/Hayes/Zo.   I'm drafting the highest star role player type I can get. Someone who knows they are a compliment piece to Zion/BI. Someone who's gonna play hard offensively and defensively. Someone who has a discernible skill like shooting or defense to get on the court as soon as possible. If that's Kispert, I go for it. Might be Trey Murphy, might be Franz Wagner.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why are you banking on a rookie being a quality role player?  I'm banking on Kispert to be a quality role player because he's shown 4 years of shooting 40.8% from 3 and the last two being 43.8% and 44% with 5.4 and 6.5 attempts per game. These are going to translate into the NBA right away unless he goes Markelle Fultz on us.   He's been asked to play his role in the NBA for 4 years at Gonzaga already. Court is getting bigger, defense is getting lazier in the regular season, pace is getting faster (not that Gonzaga wasn't already fast af), shooting is a bigger emphasize compared to college.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Build the rest of the roster with vets who have proven they can play in those spots.  Sure you can ALSO do that but I still have a draft pick in the top 10 now. I'll only trade that for Dame or another star player like Bradley Beal.   Phoenix did this same idea with Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson when ""draft experts"" thought there were better players available still. But they ended up getting their guys they wanted to build around Booker and Ayton. Atlanta as well with building around Trae Young with Hunter, Reddish, Huerter, and then went to spend money on Bogdanovic and somewhat overspent on Gallo.   There's no problem with spending on vets. But I still have to utilize this pick for my roster somehow.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There‚Äôs already been reports about Zion‚Äôs family not wanting him outta New Orleans. If those are true, then next year has to be the year Zion and his team see some kind of progression within the organization.   Relax those are bluffs. He's literally 21. The probably with the Pelicans isn't the teams talent on the floor but more with ownership and market size. If he wants out after his rookie contract so be it. I think the last time someone led their team to a championship on a rookie contract was Tim Duncan. These things take time to build.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why would you give 23 mins a game to someone like Kispert when you can just Inquire about an Eric Gordon type to play the same role but better?  Because I have a draft pick and need to use it and should get someone to fit into the roster I have already constructed. Everyone is young still. I can go get vets but I still need to draft a player baring a superstar trade like Dame or Beal."
Man you forgot De‚ÄôAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish
Cam Reddish probably hasn‚Äôt seen the movie Flubber
I kinda want the Thunder to get their hands on Cam Reddish somehow.
Cam Reddish  Bagley
The Hawks had their own injuries though. Cam Reddish missed the entire Knicks and Sixers series. De'Andre Hunter has missed the whole playoffs.
At this rate Cam Reddish will grow to 7'3 so I'll take him on the MLE
"Still early in his career but Cam Reddish. He just plays with a bunch of other wings, Atlanta prob still likes him. Another player who‚Äôs a FA we dont need to trade is Malik Monk..  he has potential as a 6man scorer, Hornets gotta pick between him or Graham to re-sign"
My answer would be Cam Reddish
"Well, that went out the window so long ago‚Ä¶ De‚ÄôAndre Hunter, Godwin, Cam Reddish and now Trae?"
Lol I‚Äôm sorry I gotta take issue with ‚Äúhealthy hawks team‚Äù they haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù cam reddish is just coming back up Bogi is hurt Trae now is hurt and we don‚Äôt have Hunter are second best player ..not at all ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù bucks are winning and will probably win the series but to call the hawks healthy is bs
"I really wish we had put in Cam Reddish to try to slow him down, Middleton was a flamethrower and hit a ton of contested looks over Bogi/Gallo. Felt like the only way to stop him would be to force him to give up the ball"
"kris dunn, tony snell, and cam reddish had zero minutes tonight. a big lineup of both OO and capela could also be a thought.  their are options, even if it‚Äôs for just a few minutes so that someone shooting 3/16 isn‚Äôt playing 36 minutes"
Imagine leaving off Cam Reddish
"That‚Äôs Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish, Bogdanovic and now Trae Young all injured"
Why not give a chance to Cam Reddish for one game maybe? See what happens
Imagine how good the Hawks would be if Hunter was healthy and Cam Reddish was a lot better.
THE STREETS NEED CAM REDDISH
PUT IN CAM REDDISH OR WE RIOT
Cam Reddish 38/6/4   5/9 from three
I got this game as being the ‚ÄúCam Reddish‚Äù game. Got his feet wet last game to break off the rust. I see him being a big swing piece this game! Mark it Down!
Shouldn't have even traded for Luka imo.  They lost too much in Cam Reddish just to get him.
10 assists. Also I doubt he plays this horrible again.   The only excuse I can come up with is that Cam Reddish was truly the last remain of the Lloyd Pierce era as he‚Äôs been injured ever since Nate took over and seeing him come on the floor for the first time in 5 months gave Trae PTSD from that
You might be thinking Cam Reddish. Came back and played in game 2 for the first time since well before the playoffs.
Cam Reddish says no
"Yes I meant Bogdonovic's leg injury, Cam Reddish just returning from injury (idk if he looked like himself I don't watch a lot of Hawks games) and the fact that Hunter is out. Bogdonovic's injury is the second most important injury in this series imo (first being Divencenzo being out completely) as his scoring would be key to putting pressure on the Bucks offense. To me the Bucks seem very happy with what the Hawks are running and are glad to be in their regular drop defense for the most part."
"Can you back that up in any way besides your feelings? Because stats and other players disagree.  Tatum is incredibly clutch. He made the most field goals when tied or behind in a 1 possession game in the last minute going 10/17 on 68.2% ts with 28 points. Dame who is known for his clutchness also had 28 points but made 3 less field goals on a still incredible 65.8% ts. Trae went 1 for 7 from the field ending up with 6 points in all (free throws) on a 36.1% ts while also having a worse win percentage than Tatum.  Tatum averaged the most 4th quarter points in the league in the regular season and did it on 61.2% ts while Trae was 14th with a lower ts. Tatum is third in 4th quarter ppg for the playoffs (not counting Cam Reddish currently because he played one game) with 8.3 and while Trae and KD both average 8.4, they both do it on worse efficiency. He also averaged 1 rebound, 1.5 assists with 0.5 turnovers, .3 steals and .5 blocks. Trae is averaging 0.7 rebounds, 1.9 assists with 1.1 turnovers and 0 steals or blocks.  I‚Äôve seen Tatum lead the team to a 32 point comeback by being the first player in league history to score 60 points with no turnovers but multiple assists (he had 5). That also made him the youngest player ever to score 60 in a win (Booker had more at a younger age but in a loss). He‚Äôs the third youngest player in league history after Rick Barry and Michael Jordan to get 50 in a playoffs game. Maybe you don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs someone to be feared as a scorer in close games, but Lebron and KD both do and I‚Äôll take their opinion over yours."
Valuable minutes to get cam reddish in and see him play.
I‚Äôm suprised putting an ice cole Cam Reddish during the middle of this run didn‚Äôt stop it
Real question is cam reddish supposed to be good. Like I understand he was a high draft pick but his stats are kinda garbage?   Also not judging him on tonight as it was his first game in forever and there was garbage time stuff
With John Collins in the playoffs still you taking him over Zion? Taking Cam Reddish over Anthony Edwards?
"r/nba children:  ""After this one game, Luka is clearly better than Trae. The Mavs won the trade!""  ""Nuh uh! After this other game, Trae is clearly better than Luka! The Hawks won the trade!""  Me, the only adult here:  ""Luka and Trae are both scrubs. Cam Reddish is the next king of the NBA. You might think this means the Hawks won the trade, but in 2 years Cam Reddish will clone himself and make a super team of all Reddish and dominate the NBA for all time."""
Y‚Äôall see a loss but I see Cam Reddish with 11 points. So was it really a hawks loss?
No because a Cam Reddish dive probably won‚Äôt take out Lebrons ankles
"I mean, he was trash during the reg season too.  and Hawks fans weren't even arguing he'd be awesome, they just said ""any Cam Reddish is better than Solomon Hill"" which yanno.. doesn't say much?"
Lalalalala I'm not listening Cam Reddish 2022 MVP here we come baby
"RJ, Zion, Cam, Tre Jones. Summer 2023 all sign with the knicks. The knicks immediately trade Cam reddish and tre Jones for a late second round pick and draft me. Make this happen Knicks!!!!!!!!!"
Did you guys see Cam Reddish though
Cam Reddish is back? Was he any good?
"If Cam Reddish has the potential to be an all star, literally anyone in the league can be called that. It would be a meaningless designation. Yes, he's breathing and a professional basketball player so I guess he has a theoretical chance some day.     But the odds are infinitesimal because his growth curve sucks. A few good games in your first two years mean nothing when you have a 9.03 PER rookie year, have eight months off to get better, and then put up a 9.36 PER. He is an inefficient player who actually found a way to shoot worse in his second year than his first.  And not just about anybody who actually watches him play would agree with you.   Here's The Athletic's ranking of the top 50 players on their rookie deals from February: https://theathletic.com/2375978/2021/02/25/zion-williamson-luka-doncic-trae-young-nba-young-talent-rankings-top-10/  Where is Cam Reddish listed? 46th behind ""potential"" all star Marvin Bagley Jr!  There's probably no player in NBA history who has had as two bad of seasons as Cam Reddish and made an all star team. So labeling him the way you do just shows a complete lack of perspective.  Cam Reddish will never be in the top one precent of active basketball players. Seems like so glaringly obvious of a statement but feel free to keep arguing because he was once a minus three in the supposed game of his life against one of the worst defenses in the league. That's definitely enough.   Coby White scored thirty in three straight games once and I would call anyone who said he was a potential all star a moron."
Any traction on nicknaming Cam Reddish as Cam Reddit?
getting blown out just to get Cam Reddish back into game shape is massive dick energy
Still no cam reddish in the 2nd halfüòì
At least let Cam Reddish find some rhythm instead of playing Bogi on one leg
"Probably a better time than ever to pull the starters and just let Brandon Goodwin and Cam Reddish play their way back in form, it's going to be like 15 minutes of garbage time anyway"
"Nah Mavs did win the trade but its not because of Trae its because the second part of the trade, Cam Reddish, didn't pan out. Atleast not yet"
Cam Reddish was probably the test subject during the trabsporter's trials
Cam Reddish looks like he doesn't where the he is beamed down too
Cam Reddish 3 minutes played and -14 OMG
That Cam Reddish +/- though
CAM REDDISH HAS COME INTO THE GAME! THIS IS TRULY INSPIRATIONAL
Cam Reddish?!!
I knew I wasn‚Äôt crazy. Cam reddish is real
CAM REDDISH
CAM REDDISH
Cam Reddish is in!
CAM REDDISH üòÄ
Cam Reddish sighting!
At this point you gotta see what Cam Reddish can give you over playing Solomon Hill.
Cam Reddish
"And we got Cam Reddish, the real MVP of that trade"
the hawks don‚Äôt have deandre or cam reddish. ik losing danny green hurts the sixers but it‚Äôs not an excuse to lose the series when the hawks have their own injury issues as well.
I mean do they have the better talent? I think it‚Äôs too early to say with how many young guys we have if this is a fluke or our coming out party. We also are missing Deandre Hunter and Cam Reddish currently.
Its not Trae for Luka tho is it? The Mavs also gave up their first round pick in 2019 (ultimately became Cam Reddish) and people seem to forget that
"No, Luka is the decisive reason the Mavs won the Trae/Luka trade. Any improvement Trae (or Reddish) continues to make, just means the Hawks didn't get robbed *quite* so bad.  I mean c'mon, Luka is an MVP-caliber player at age 22 (!!!), that means the Mavs won the trade hands down regardless of Cam Reddish or Trae or any other factor."
"&gt; This is false. Dallas made two lottery picks - DSJ and Luka. Hawks selected Trae, Reddish, Hunter, Okongwu all in the top 10.  Maybe that was because you traded one of your lottery picks (who ended up being Cam Reddish, the entire subject of this post) to us to actually get Doncic? What kind of logic is this..."
"I remember seeing a video posted a while ago that was Anthony Edwards hanging out with a bunch of other top recruits around his age and the interviewer asked who was the toughest guy he faced in high school, Ant said Cam Reddish and all the guys in the room agreed immediately. The guy‚Äôs got all the tools in the world to be great but I have no idea why he isn‚Äôt yet and why he wasn‚Äôt at Duke"
"I don't think it pushes Atlanta into ""winning the trade"" but I think it makes it less bad.   Luka is a top 5 NBA player. That's worth more than a top 25 player in Trae. Even if Trae becomes the 10th best NBA player, that's not as valuable as a top 5 player/MVP. If Cam Reddish turns out to be a borderline all-star, that still doesn't move the trade in Atlanta's favor imo. In the NBA, a dollar is worth more than four quarters.   As an analogy. Would a team trade Lebron's career for Dame and CJ's careers? No. But having CJ on top of Dame makes it much less of a bad trade."
Is cam reddish good? He used to brick shots at duke from what I recall
"cam reddish isn't the deciding factor of anything, ever, for any reason."
No because Dallas will not feel like they lost the trade outside potential injury issues to Luka. Atlanta I‚Äôm sure has 0 qualms about Trae and truly feel he‚Äôs better. Both teams have already won so Cam reddish doesn‚Äôt really change anything unless he becomes a superstar
"Agreed, they are both historically great young players. Luka obviously has more of the accolades, awards, and the man was ridiculous in his first playoff series. Trae has that underdog mentality and it just fits with this team. I wouldn't reverse the trade if I could, it's still too early to tell on Cam Reddish and he's shown flashes of brilliance."
last year his third scoring option was Jabari Parker..until the trade lol and Atlanta had a 43 year old Vince Carter on the floor with Trae Young sometimes. DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish were rookies and weren't they running DeWayne Dedmon/Alex Len for center? it's almost like..you put a true superstar floor general with a real roster and suddenly things like this start happening. Last years Hawks didn't even play a minute of Clint Capela after the trade
Not really... it was Luka for Trae and the pick that became Cam Reddish. Two players didn‚Äôt make the roster the way it is LOL
"The X-Factor is what Cam Reddish turns out to be. A year ago it was looking like he was going to be a 2 way monster, but he was bad this season. Lloyd Pierce didn‚Äôt do him any favors by bullying him lmao."
"While this trade does seem like a win-win it's hard for me to call this the most win-win ever, for it to be a win-win you almost have to think about how would Dallas be with Trae Young and Cam Reddish and how would Atlanta be with Luka Doncic. If both teams are worse then yes it is a win-win trade however I think Atlanta gets better and Dallas gets worse. I know Trae Young is really hot right now and is having a great playoffs and is leading his team incredibly right now but if I'm Atlanta and Dallas offered me Luka straight up for Trae Young and Cam Reddish that's an instant accept"
"Man, imagine if after all of the hyperanalysis of Trae and Luka, the determinant of who won the trade (or, if you're a 'they can both win!!!' kinda person, who won the trade more), is Cam Reddish"
I don't see a world where he plays again with Cam Reddish being healthy so basically hawks in 6 then hawks in 4 ez.
"Are you saying Lou Williams, who took Trae's minutes, is a better defender than Trae?  Or do you think that maybe Cam Reddish taking Solo Hill's minutes has a bigger impact (positively) on the defense?"
Cam Reddish is the greatest basketball player of all time
#CAM REDDISH
"molten-hot take: we won the Trae &lt;-&gt; Luka trade, but only because Cam Reddish is the best out of all three players."
"First and foremost, what happened to Giannis sucked. Hopefully both he and Trae can go in game 5.  I'm so proud of and impressed with the Hawks effort from tip off tonight. They played with an intensity that Milwaukee didn't match, particularly defensively. It's amazing that Cam Reddish hadn't played 5 on 5 basketball since February until game 2 and came out and really gave the team a boost.  It sucks when a star gets hurt, but you can't stop playing and the Hawks put their foot on the gas and put the game away then. Who the hell knows what's going to happen next. I'm so proud of these Atlanta Hawks."

the cam reddish game
WE FUCKING LOVE CAM REDDISH
honestly if cam reddish wasn't out there we would be getting blown out
Cam Reddish has been no bueno so far.
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
I really believe cam reddish will be all nba defense at some point in his career
Cam reddish is Fuckin stupid on both ends of the court in opposite ways
