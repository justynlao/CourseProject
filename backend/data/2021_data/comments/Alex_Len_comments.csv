What you talking about? Obviously this decade belongs to Alex Len
"The Wizards need to sign a Centre. Robin Lopez has been ass and I believe they just signed Alex Len who is a rotation player. Without a starting centre that can protect the rim and drop 15 pts a game, it‚Äôs going to be a long year for the Wizards and Beal‚Äôs frustration will only grow."
"üíñ Facts I love about Trae ü•µüíñ :   2017: He's way to short he's never gonna be good in the NBA. Just because he plays like Curry doesn't mean he should be a lottery pick. We're watching the next bust of the NBA everyone.  2018 (Trae Young gets drafted): Nice so every small point guard that can shoot 3s is automatically Steph Curry? So glad my team didn't draft him. Don't cry if he's a bust when I told you so.  2018-19 season 1st half: He can't shoot he's just a confident shooter. His efficiency is so bad and he's not a good scorer. 2018-19 season 2nd half: He's a ball hawk he should pass more to his teammates. And he's also playing bad teams right now. He's gonna be out of the league soon, never gonna be an all-star  2019-20 season 1st half: He's putting up empty stats he can't play defense. He's can't carry his team to wins. His defense is gonna be a problem. Hawks should trade him for my team for a few picks and a mediocre player because he can't play defense and his efficiency is garbage. 2019-20 season 2nd half: He shouldn't have been an All-Star with one of the worst records in the East. He hasn't even proven he can win. He's only proven that he can lose.  2020-21 season currently: He needs to stop foul baiting. It's not fun to watch and he is ruining the game with it. He can't win without shooting free throws. Once he's in the playoffs he's gonna average 19 points. He can't score on hard defense. Beal should be an All-Star starter over him because he clearly isn't averaging empty stats and also #FreeBeal even though he chose to be on that bad Wizards team and plays to win not to score.  How many times does Trae have to prove you guys wrong again? It's always been popular to hate on him. People are so mad that he isn't a bust that they find every way to hate on him.  Of Course he's not gonna be able to win in his second season. You're drafted into a rebuilding team. Almost no one can carry their team to winning in his first or second season. The Hawks literally had a g-league roster. John was out for 25 games so Jabari Parker was their second player for 25 games. Cam, Huerter, Hunter were all too young to be impactful. Alex Len isn't a starting caliber center and wouldn't even get minutes on most teams. Of Course he can't win with that team. Even Luka can't.  Also people who used empty stats last year have clearly died or something. I hear absolutely no one calling Beal Mr. Empty stats. Even though he is in his 8th season and still can't win. His usage% is also the highest in the league right now and he doesn't pass a lot. #FreeBeal is stupid and idiotic. He chose to be on a bad team and score a lot. Keep the same energy with Beal as you all did with Lavine, Young, Booker and every young guy. And he just said he want to stay with the wizards. Beal is clearly doing it to break scoring records. He doesn't want to win he just wants to score.   Steve Nash: ""That's not basketball"". Also Steve Nash 2 years ago: We're as similar as players from different eras can be."
I am here for the Alex Len group therapy session.
Bro I watched Trae play with Alex Len and Kent Bazemore.
"As a Suns fan who went through the same thing with Booker, I cannot stress how much I disliked the Alex Len experience. Worst hands I have ever seen on a big man"
"Better. Our roster the past 2 seasons have been awful, Alex Len was the starting center for many of those games and half the players on those teams aren‚Äôt even in the league anymore."
My guy saw Alex Len get waived and woke up
I think you are right and I think the reason we waived Alex Len was to make room for Yuta
hey did Alex Len get injured?
Wagner making an impact.  Alex Len should never get another minute ever again.
Alex Len would be better than Perry for the Nets lol
"oh yeah, I forgot about that but still, Alex Len is legitimately terrible"
Wagner should be playing way more than Alex Len
Things started going downhill for us as soon as we cut Alex Len.
"&gt;Also just because Alex Len is taller than Harrell doesn't make him better or ""more of a center"".  Yeah, it actually does.  Josh Hart is one of the best rebounding guards in the whole league -- averaging almost 8 per game -- for example, but he's not a center because he just is not tall enough.  &gt;Len was waived for a reason.  Obviously this is true.  He was also picked up by Washington, who was very early in the waiver order, for a reason.  And he also posted 9/9 in half a game for them two days ago.  He was also once a #5 overall pick, so it's not like he's just some guy from a local Y.  The best coach that Len ever played more than 10 games for might be Luke Walton -- and while I like Walton as a coach, that's damning with pretty faint praise.  Of course he's a reclamation project, but that's about all the Lakers have the option to acquire, at the moment, so a probably-undercoached guy with physical tools is probably as high as their sights can be set.  A couple months ago, most people thought Harrell was an awful defender.  Turns out, he's at least competent -- with proper coaching, and matched up against players he can handle.  &gt;I'm pretty sure if we signed him you'd be complaining on threads about how shit he is too, just like you are with Harrell/Gasol right now.  It would behoove you to learn how to read.  I never said Gasol or Harrell are shit.  They both have played fairly well -- but one is not an NBA center, and the other can only play about 15 effective minutes a game, and only against some specific matchups.  Gasol is also 36 years old, and the list of guys his size who were not injury risks at that age, is very short.  What if Gasol, say, sprains an ankle, and loses another step once he recovers?  Who can he guard then?  He's already averaging just 4.4 rebounds, and more than twice as many turnovers as assists."
"Also just because Alex Len is taller than Harrell doesn't make him better or ""more of a center"". Len was waived for a reason. I'm pretty sure if we signed him you'd be complaining on threads about how shit he is too, just like you are with Harrell/Gasol right now."
"Probably the best option they could've actually acquired was Alex Len, but Washington snagged him off the waiver wire.  Not particularly skilled, but big, and mobile.  Good enough to back up Gasol for 15 minutes a night and start in emergencies if Gasol is unavailable, and to let Davis continue to play against the forwards who cannot handle him.  I wonder if Washington would trade him for a completely-used-up Wesley Matthews or a second round pick or something?  Maybe a project Antetokounmpo?"
"In the regular season, attitude.  Which shouldn't matter much, unless you think home-court is valuable in the playoffs.  In the playoffs, they have an issue with their big depth.  They really only have Gasol and Davis -- one doesn't want to be a center, and the other only has about 20 minutes to offer,  at best, and those are only plausible in specific matchups.  I'd love to see them pick up a guy like Alex Len from the Wizards, and I bet they would have if he made it that far down the waiver wire a couple weeks ago.  Not particularly skilled, but big and mobile, just as insurance.  Otherwise, as long as they are healthy-enough to keep Matthews parked on the bench where he belongs, their roster doesn't have much in the way of holes."
"Let‚Äôs not go quite there yet, man. Alex Len was the bane of my existence when he had his stint with the Suns. He lived rent free in my head for years and fuck you for bringing that back up!"
"Here was my state of mind as that draft pick happened  ‚ÄúNerlens Noel dropped to 5?? We gonna pick Nerlens!‚Äù  Stern: With the 5th pick of the NBA draft, the Phoenix suns select...  ‚ÄúWelcome to the team Nerlens‚Äù  ...Alex Len  ‚Äú*MOTHERFUCK*‚Äù"
"Man, 11 games of the Alex Len experience was excruciating, I don't know how you guys put up with it for so long."
Ayton has Alex Len hands
"lol so you think Porzingis and Parker are essentially the same player. You‚Äôve told me all I need to know about your basketball IQ. ‚ÄúEveryone knows Trae had a better supporting cast in Parker, 2 rookies, and Alex Len!‚Äù lol ok"
"... Did you not see our team when Trae was in a slump? What kind of shit ass take is this? Since you‚Äôre such a stat nerd, look up the rest of his teams shooting, scoring, and defensive ratings. He had no team and the only other decent player last year was suspended for like a third of the season. We were STARTING Alex Len. A center who is now like third string for the WIZARDS..... WE STARTED HIM"

Just noticed Alex Len was on the wizardsüòÇ feels great not seeing him in a hawks jersey
League down bad for big men... Alex Len getting signed
"&gt; Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len  oh my fucking god"
"I agree with a lot of what you're saying, but the blame shouldn't be on Beal. They're a bad team. Westbrook has looked awful (I believe he will figure out though) and injured. Bryant is their third best player (where would he rank in the league? Maybe top 100) is hurt.  Ish Smith, Jerome Robinson, and Garrison Matthews are in their top 10 for minutes, How many teams would have these guys in their top MPG? 19 players have stepped onto the court for them already this season. What is Beal supposed to do? He is surrounded by a struggling Westbrook, injured players, and a bunch of 10-13th men. Do you want Westbrook, Jerome Robinson, Bertans, and Alex Len taking more shots? You think that solves the problem?   I agree Beal's 35/5/5 (on great efficiency) is inflated, but that's like all-time great season. He's putting up runaway MVP numbers. If Beal was putting up Lavine numbers then your overall point has some legs, but he's putting up insane numbers. Very few players can have a season that Beal is having no matter how bad their team is. So no, he isn't ""35/5/5 good"" but he's a top 15 player and shouldn't even be questioned for all-star/All NBA."
"We missing like 6 key guys lol ... Beal was playing with a bunch of bad players who shot worse than him.   Like do you want Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len taking those shots instead?  Neto, Lopez, and Matthews are probably the only players there that may get playing time if the team is healthy."
&gt; Alex Len  That‚Äôs a really low bar
"Alex Len might have been the 2nd best player yesterday, idk how you can blame Beal"
"All their good players are out..Bryant, Westbrook (lol), Deni, Rui. Alex Len might have been the 2nd best player on the court today"
"It‚Äôs almost as if we lost Gasol as well who was our most important defensive piece, replaced him with Alex Len who we then wavied &amp; didn‚Äôt think it was necessary to replace.   It‚Äôs almost as if we lost our big rotation &amp; replaced them with lesser parts."
Alex Len
Russ always trash talked. It was usually just with bigs. Was common to see him talk trash with bigs from Alex Len to Embiid.  But yea after KD left the microscope was on and every PG he stood up against would make the Frontpage of this sub.
"We spent the past while with Alex Len, Cousins wouldn't have been much worse and him having a good game at the same time as boucher would probably have flipped our record."
I wish somebody would give Thon Maker a chance ....wiz shouldve signed him instead of Alex Len
Alex Len and Jordan Bell are our last hope to fade for Cade
"But I was told he was Nerlens Noel who got to catch lobs from James Harden / no better than Alex Len?  Just kidding, all my homies hate lardbiscuits"
"Nets fans and media keep saying everything will be cool once the team gels and they get solid pieces in the buyout market.  Like... what is the buyout market going to even look like?   If players like Whiteside or Ariza are considered solid in the buyout market... or that Alex Len had multiple suitors after being waived by the Raptors a couple days ago... I don't think the buyout market is going to look particularly great.  Also they can't combine the DPE of $5.7M they got for Dinwiddie. You can divide that amongst several players, but you can combine that with, say, your vet MLE of $5.7M to spread $11.4M  any way you wish. (And you can only sign players on last year of contract w/ DPE money.)"
Oh yes Alex Len and sometimes Vince carter.
"Pretty much their entire team? Hawks had to run VC at PF for significant minutes lmao. Jabari Parker was our 2nd best player, and Alex Len was our best C over the entire year, and he *just* found a job.   But anyways I‚Äôm not gonna argue this point with you anymore cuz your either trolling or you just don‚Äôt get it lol"
They should have picked up Alex Len /s
I watched Alex Len start at center last year.
Brooklyn shouldve picked up Alex Len lol
if you need depth in the frontcourt Alex Len is not for you
Id draft a wooden chair over Alex Len ngl
"Harry Giles is 22 tho.  Alex Len is 27.  Idk, more power to him if ""minutes"" is the reason, but at this stage in his career I think teams know what they're getting with Len.  He's probably not going to play his way into a bigger contract.  I suppose he could just want to play, even on a bad team and knowing he probably isn't going to be improving his future earnings either way.  Hoopers hoop I guess lol."
You know who else has 0 talent at center? Alex Len
"Tucker could get Houston an asset, they‚Äôd be dumb to buy him out. I don‚Äôt see Javale just getting let go either, Cavs are decent and he‚Äôs decent.   Ed Davis is a good candidate. I don‚Äôt know about his defense but Alex Len just got waived and might be worth a shot."
Alex Len
Alex Len and Vince carter??????
We just waived Alex Len. But yeah that‚Äôs not helping anyone. They can have Baynes for a pack of Doritos.
"Alex Len ain't it, when you get cut by a team desperate at your position it's very telling."
"The Nets need to go grab Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Alex Len, just NBA bodies to throw out there. Right now they only have about 7 competent players"
"Hey now, Damian Jones is actually on a team, which is more than can be said for Alex Len and Dewayne Dedmoney."
"Alex Len, elite center"
Welcome Alex Len to the Brooklyn Nets
The Raptors have waived Alex Len.
Sources tell me that the Cavs are signing Len to play PG.      Cavs starting lineup:  PG: Alex Len  SG: Kevin Love  SF: Jarrett Allen  PF: Javale Mcgee  C: Andre Drummond
"I love Alex Len as a human, but basketball is paying him a once in a lifetime salary and he just isn't very good at the sport. Last season I got to see a lot of great examples."
That's Ex Terp Alex Len to you filthy fucking casuals.
Alex Len is available for the Nets. Not sure if they go for that
Future Portland trailblazer big man Alex Len.
"Alex Len isn't good.  For real, if the Raptors are still trying to contend this year, I'd like to see the Raptors acquire Nikola Vucevic.  Not sure how though, since I imagine FVV and OG are untouchable.  The alternative could be Andre Drummond, but he doesn't fit the Raptors style-of-play at all."
"Seriously, is Alex Len thread worthy?"
Upvoted for having Alex Len and Serious in your title.
I sat courtside at a Spurs vs Hawks game two years ago and Alex Len looks like a straight up medieval mythical giant  Dude is an enormous human being and would be extremely physically draining for someone like KD
Top 5 pick Alex Len
Not speaking on alex len but i want to push back a little to say that effort is vastly underrated in this sub generally.   Its the real difference a lot of nights in this league tbh.
In my Kevin Malone voice: it‚Äôs bad. It‚Äôs real bad  Alex Len is pizza by Alfredo
"Okay, but what Big is on the market who would fit our defensive scheme? We *need* someone who can rebound and score at the basket like Drummond, yes he has defensive shortcomings, but are you telling me Aron Baynes and Alex Len right now don't?"
Rather take RHJ and use him as a small-ball center again than Alex Len.  And boy did I hate those experimental lineups Kenny used......
I‚Äôm surprised Wizards front office didn‚Äôt jump on Len when we needed a center in the off season. Maybe Alex Len didn‚Äôt even want to sign with us lol
"if Alex Len is on ur roster and getting minutes, you are signaling to the league that are you are no longer trying to win games lmaoüò≠üíÄ  Good move for the Raptors"
I was referring to war heroes. Has Alex Len served in the military before?
Alex Len is probably a better veterinarian than he is a basketball player if that's what you're asking
I still think of Alex Len as being young but he's on his 8th year in the NBA and 27 years old now
watching Alex Len last season was torture. Felt really bad when the Raps signed him
Future mvp Alex Len
Warriors want vet bigs to mentor wiseman. Is Alex Len a good vet?
[Alex Len](https://d1tjohjvimcqgl.cloudfront.net/category/136965_n.jpg) looks like the default 2k character
i heard the raps waived Alex Len
Nah that's Alex Len (since they similar)
May I introduce you to Alex Len.
You'd think the Raptors would have a more equitable distribution when they put Alex *Len in.*
That's what I'm saying he was literally the only one who could score the ball at all. If he even 'just' had 50 they would have been absolutely annihilated.  I looked up the box score and the 2 next best scorers for the Suns were Barbosa and Alex Len with 11 lmao. The game would never have been close because the rest of the team was just so bad that game
"And Some Mock Drafts had players like Otto Porter Jr, Alex Len and Ben McLemore going 1st"
"&gt;He makes no money..impossible to trade for anyone significant.  That's not quite true.  I'm not saying that this is a sensible trade, but just for example, he could be traded for 2 years of Donte DiVincenzo straight up.  Or Matisse Thybulle and 3 years of his contract.  His salary would fit with trading for Alex Len, if the Lakers decided they do need an actual backup center.  There aren't many players making sub $3M, but there are a few interesting ones -- Caruso included."
"Listen, I will always root for the Raptors to win the game I'm watching. But there's tons of upside to losing this season as well.   First of all, this is a fake ass season. Half the league has covid, the Raptors are playing 72 road games essentially, and there's so much shit going on that I really don't think this season matters. Asterisk season. If there's a year to bottom out and just chalk it up to external circumstances, it's this one.  Second, I'm tired of always having to develop guys. I love that our team is filled with underdog guys who were drafted late and worked their way to starring roles for this franchise are great stories, but our only lottery picks on the roster are Stanley Johnson and Alex Len. For once can we just have a naturally gifted talent to build around? Can we get a Ja Morant or a Jayson Tatum. Even RJ Barrett would be a great type of player to take and develop under an organization that has proven to get the best out of its draft picks. Why not? This year's draft class is supposed to be stacked, this is the year to have a top pick. We have never signed a star free agent, we could trade for one, but we have no real trade pieces without gutting this roster for it to be even worth it. The easiest way to inject star potential talent is with a top 5 pick. We have the pieces to go, FVV/OG/Siakam, and you pair that up with a Cade/Mobley and we're off. It's just one season."
Aaron Baynes and Alex Len for Drummond straight up for Toronto
"I'll state out front that this is an active debate among Raptors fans, but there is a growing number of us that believe in doing a 2019-2020 Warriors style rebuild, where we suck for one year to grab a talented young player.  We have 2 lottery picks on our team: Stanley Johnson and Alex Len. A lot of our players are really good (OG, Fred, Siakam, Kyle) but we don't have a #1 option and ultimately that puts a cap on our ceiling.  We're playing in f*cking Tampa Bay during a pandemic, where every game is an away game, we got off to a terrible start and have a team with fundamental flaws (e.g. our centers are unplayable, except Boucher who isn't a center), and we're probably looking at a competitive 2nd round series at best right now.  If we can dip into the lottery, grab a top 5 guy in this stacked draft, and then go back to being perennially competitive, I think it's a great move."
"No, we‚Äôre starting Alex Len and you will like it. #FadeForCade"
"How is that any different than Anthony Bennett, Jarrett Culver, Mo Bamba, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Alex Len, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, or Thomas Robinson being set up to fail, or failed by their teams?"
Deandre Jordan is still like 40x better than Aron Baynes and Alex Len. At least he has functioning hands and a vertical more than 15 inches
Trade for Alex Len or Baynes
"Don't forget an old banged up Baynes, and Alex ""Stole all the sunshine"" Len"
Are 11 2nd rounders worth enough?  u/LAClippers get:  Bradley Beal  Alex Len  u/WashWizards get:  Lou Williams  Marcus Morris Sr.  Luke Kennard  Patrick Patterson  2022 - RD 2  2022 - RD 2  2023 - RD 2  2023 - RD 2  2024 - RD 2  2024 - RD 2  2025 - RD 2  2025 - RD 2  2026 - RD 2  2026 - RD 2  2027 - RD 2  https://tradenba.com/trades/Oe3lbVZ00

Where exactly are you seeing the level of support on this post from NBA players? I see Alex Len and Quentin Richardson that's it. Tell me please.
you guys don't see to need KD that much. Hows about you trade him to us for a lil bit of depth.  KD for Alex Len and Troy Brown Jr? Can't see a reason you guys don't do it. Solves your depths problem by adding a net 1 player
"Bismack Biyombo, Lucas Nogueira, Ian Mahinmi, Alex Len and Cole Aldrich"
"Wym he was playing with bonafide NBA superstars like Marquese Chriss, Alex Len and Jared Dudley. How much more help did Booker need"
"Suns starting lineup that game was Tyler Ulis, Book, Derrick Jones Jr (who I like a lot but he was very raw back then), Marquese Chriss (who I don't like a lot but was also incredibly raw) and Alex Len. 3 guys off the bench who got minutes were the corpses of Leandro Barbosa and Jared Dudley + Big Sauce (Alan Williams, my guy!)"
Oh god the Alex Len ptsd
Alex Len was better than him. If he want to know he bad he is.
"1 on 1, but it scrubs vs former MVPs  Like Cody Martin vs Micheal Jordan  Or Alex Len vs Shaq  Or Dennis smith jr vs Steve nash"
They have an open spot after dropping Alex Len early this year
9. Aaron Baynes  10. Alex Len
Suns legend Alex len. When did the wiz sign len? I must have missed it
"They haven't been as good as last year, but you think that has anything to do with losing our entire centre rotation? Replacing Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka with Baynes and Alex Len? And even with that, the Raptors are 7th in the league in defensive efficiency, and of current playoff teams they're in the 7th-9th range of defensive rating (adjusted or unadjusted). Again, this is a team regularly giving minutes to Aron Baynes at center. How is that terrible defense by any metric?  Sources:  https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/defensive-efficiency  https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/defensive-efficiency"
former lottery pick/raptors legend alex len is gonna feast tonight
We sacrificed Alex Len for this
"I mean even Alex Len is shooting 32% on 3's at 1 attempt per game this season and is generally considered a non-shooter you leave open. Point is, very few players are absolute non-shooters (cough cough Ben Simmons).  We can likely ease 3 in the Key to 5 in the Key on both offense and defense to give some variety to defensive strategies and even more variety to offensive winning strategies in a few years.   I'm all for this change given how well teams shoot nowadays as most offenses look similar in their 3-or-layup schemes; every  team is running pin downs to either get a wing 3/ triple threat or a back-cut predicated on the threat of a wing 3/ triple threat play.  Having Embiid camp in the lane and occupying 2+ defenders while teammates drive/ swing the ball around would be quite a juxtaposed strategy to watch."
"2-3 weren't his fault. One of his passes literally bounced off Alex Len because the dude just wasn't there mentally,  it was hilarious."
Alex Len
"Thats literally right up there with Zach LaVine on Alex Len, LeBron on Nurkic, Vince Carter on that french dude.. jesus christ, thats a legit poster none of that side dunk shit, he faced him and dunked on his fucking head"
never thought I'd say this but I'm confused as to why Alex len is not in to close this game
"Wizards Alex Len is decent, not sure what Raptors fans were going through"
Alternative title: Westbrook with the perfect pass for Alex Len
Good for Alex Len to keep his NBA career going this long..
Saw the title. Thought the joke was Alex Len missing an easy look. You got me OP.
He's better than Alex Len

"as a German I followed Wagners development quite a bit, nice to see something positive about him.      Not clear to me why they signed Alex Len when they still had Wagner and Lopez even after their starting C had the season ending injury     Scott brooks seems to get a lot of criticism on here but when a player who just got cut by another team which has huge problems on that role gets to start on his new team, I really think that the Wizards shouldn't let this coach still train these guys"
"This is compared to Robin Lopez and Alex Len.  Mo Wagner is a way better defender than those 2. You want to compare him to Bam, sure he is weak.  I'm just saying Wagner is the clear cut best center for the Wiz."
"Unfortunately, shit hurts. Lots of young guys that are too hesitant, can't create on their own.  Beal is great but we need more defense and he needs to involve his team more to get them going. They're better with westbrook on the floor from the eye test but he's not enough to carry anyone. Definitely regressing in places. Bertans is literally only good for 3s but didn't make enough.  And holy shit they keep doing this run along side the ball carrier thing with their hands up to not foul but still somehow run into the shooter with their bodies and still commit a foul.  Robin lopez at least looks a bit better on offense but that s a minimal upgrade from where he was. Alex fuckin len, idk even know. Like 1/20 of what Steven adams is.  And yes all of this is scott brooks fault"
"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."
Behind Aron Baynes and Alex Len
"Suns FO has been turned around by James Jones.  He made moves that were and are still unpopular (cash for TJ Warren), he did them to improve the entire team, and now they are here.     I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to compare Dragan Bender draft to Ayton.  Bender and Chriss were chosen in the same draft top 10 and it was widely considered a good draft because at least one of them would work out... right?  I think it‚Äôs more fair to compare moves like the Bender draft with the Alex Len pick which was horrible.   Meanwhile Ayton is a walking 18/10 and is finally getting mean on the court.  Idk how Doncic would have fit in in Phx lineup.  Obviously he‚Äôs a fantastic talent, but by fit I mean the role and position he plays.  Could‚Äôve been interesting, but the more time goes on the more I like Ayton and how the rest of the team was built out around him and Booker"
"Fair points and I actually agree that the Butler trade was a poor one in hindsight. Lavine/Markannen/KAT would be a promising core. That said, I just want to touch on one point.  &gt;The Suns, meanwhile, drafted Booker and then made some bad picks in the next few drafts (e.g. Dragan Bender; picking Ayton over Doncic).  You understand that there is a very real possibility this happens to the Hawks as well? Even the top of the draft can be an absolute crap shoot. It‚Äôs entirely possible they just kick another season away to draft the next Dragan Bender or Alex Len."
Alex Len
Your all good. It‚Äôs because Russ needs to attack the rim but Lopez sticks in the paint which gives him no space. Instead he should be paired with Moe Wagner or Alex Len because they can shoot threes and provide some spacing
The Alex Len revenge game.
One player on the wizards in the positives on +/- Raptors legend Alex Len
"Alex ""Wait, im starting? Wow, the depth must be in trouble..."" Len"
Lmao Alex Len
"among active players, those with most rs games ando yet zero playoffs experience are:  1. Alex Len, 484 games 2. Elfrid Payton, 413 3. Julius Randle, 401 4. Zach LaVine, 376 5. Wilie Cauley-Stein, 372  **6) Devin Booker, 361**"
"Honestly if I was compiling a tier list of great defender it goes like this:   Elite: luka doncic, trae young, Alex Len, Rudy gobert, and AD  Good: jimmy butler, jokic, KP, Bradley Beal.  Bad: LeBron, dort, isiah Thomas, lamelo balls, London balls, and Kyle Korber.   Just my opinion tho."
"I am hoping that Pelinka is calling Tommy Shephard every day and offering a second-round pick or something to re-acquire Mo Wagner, actually.  I mean, the Scotty Brooks refuses to play the kid, so why not send him back?  Or, Alex Len -- whichever one Washington decides not to keep.  Hell, I'd send them Wesley Matthews if they want him, even after his first useful game of the year tonight."
Lol 3pt shooting is part of embiids game but thats not even what makes him great. So in that sense Alex len should at least avg 20-10
Time to hide my Alex Len hate mail from the feds
Oh no I am so scared of Alex Len
oh shit alex len finna pop off next game 5 points 6 rebounds
nobody cares enough about alex len to tweet about him
nobody talks about Alex Len
You don‚Äôt want to make an enemy out of Alex Len
I'd rather blow a wide open layup than get embarrassed by Hawks Legend Alex Len
i love how nobody knew who alex len was until we decided to waive him and now he's a meme
I'll put Alex Len on Jokic anytime. He was so good in that Nuggets Blazers series 2019.
Great to see Alex Len unleashed finally
That's Raptors legend Alex Len to you.
alex len more like awex wen
Imagine losing to Alex Len
"But when it counted, Alex Len held it down"
Cannot for the life of me believe Alex Len just made a game-saving play
"&gt;The struggle is real for the Raptors at the 5 this year.  Meanwhile, the guy they waived -- Alex Len -- has 5 boards in 12 minutes tonight against Chicago.  Also has 8 points and 2 blocks."
Should have kept Alex Len around a little longer so we could pull off this swap
"Brooklyn scared they won't be able to beat the Wizards and their elite center rotation of Moe Wagner, Robin Lopez, and Alex Len"
have you not seen Chris getting bullied by other centres throughout the season? Alex freaking Len manhandled him.  Baynes sucks but he‚Äôs less likely to be thrown around.
Wizards put out Jerome Robinson and Alex Len out with westbrook for extended minutes and people come to the conclusion Westbrook is the problem on the court. Scott brooks puts out a small 3 guard lineup that can‚Äôt shoot and people come to the conclusion that‚Äôs it‚Äôs Westbrook.
"Tbf most of the team during this last stretch has been trash.  Like look back at the last 6 games,  who are these people? Bertans is either hurt or streaky.  Deni i guess needs to develop more,  in not sure what his role is. Robin looks better on offense but can't defend or even attempt to rebound.  Alex len is a big,  that's it nothing to add to that.  Neto is scrappy which is great but to small to defend.  Matthew can shoot 3s but his defense is either a foul or getting a charge.  Then we got gafford who seems to be a great pick and roll guy for westbrook but if course he gets hurt. Ish Smith doesn't fit at all, he passes up shots way too much. The rest are just bodies they throw in there.  Now i think westbrook has been trying to turn it up with beal and rui out but you're right, the during isnt exactly the same. And he's always been pretty inefficient but his free throws are terrible and he is taking alot of questionable shots. But ultimately i enjoy how he plays so idk why people always trip"
"from what i've seen of him, his pick and roll game with alex len seem to be pretty good"
We would‚Äôve been better off keeping Alex Len lol
And for less than a $1m cap hit instead of nearly $25m on top of it. Dude has less of a cap hit than fucking Alex Len
Alex Len is at 63% and DeAndre is almost at 80%
He's been trash all year. I have up on him when I saw Alex Len feasting on him. He made Len look like an all-star
Hes gonna get bodied by drummond and Gasol. Alex Len ate him alive last game
We have nobody to guard raptors legend Alex Len!
JC played a lot at 4 next to Alex Len and Dedmon from his rookie year until this season. He started games at the 5 because Lloyd Pierce's thing was talent development and he felt like handing all the young guys starting jobs over vets without earning them was a good thing for their development.
"Would have still been an improvement from last year's bigs lol.  Alex Len Damian Jones Jabari Parker, occasionally"
"Alex Len! Jk. I don‚Äôt know if his ceiling was really that high.  Probably marquise Chriss. He showed flashes of being a super athletic 4, who could rim run, block shots, and even shoot. He just couldn‚Äôt put it together."
"Alex Len, Garrison Matthews and Chandler Hutchinson played a combined 50+ mins and scored grand total of 0 LOL."
"Without looking at Google or the comments, can you name which player came from where?  #Wizards  * Rui Hachimura * Deni Avdija * Davis Bertans  * Robin Lopez * Raul Neto * Issac Bonga * Alex Len  #Mavs  * Luka Doncic * Tingus Pingus * Boban * Maxi Kleber * Willie Cauley-Stien * Dwight Powell * Nicolo Melli * Josh Green"
Remember that this is comparing to Alex Len that was 3rd string for the Raptors and was cut.  This is also comparing against Robin Lopez who barely saw the court in last few seasons backing up his bro.
PER 36 is fucking unrealistic. It's not an equalizer. It gives players this magical level of stamina that they simply do not fucking have. On top of that it acts as though with those tired ass legs that they would somehow play at the same pace as they played at 20 minutes. It's a fucking joke of a statistic and only ever used by people trying to make incredibly weak statements about basketball. It's not that he won't get those additional 10 minutes. It's that he would play MUCH worse in those 10 minutes. PER 36 is the notorious stat that had Alex Len as the best PER 36 C in the year for a year.
"I think our FO underestimated the retooling they did. After losing Ibaka and Gasol, we signed Alex Len and Baynes. At first, signing didn't look too bad but it was evident when we were 2-8.   We had a decent run mid season and then covid happened. The team is trying to pull through after recovering from covis but the season is just a write off at this point. I want to see how we do in the lottery and hope we can land top 3 pick and just move onto the next season like this one never happened."
Alex Len competes for balls with the ferocity of a dead marmot.
"It may be league average but he‚Äôs putting up 18.2ppg and taking 14.4 shots a game, takes tough shots, and fits the warriors offense very well. Plus TS is skewed by centers who take most of their shots around the rim. Alex Len 67.%, deandre Jordan 76.8%, Wendell carter jr 86.7% yet I don‚Äôt think anybody would call them better scorers than Wiggins.   You‚Äôre also underrating his defense. He guards the teams best wing and sometimes guards and should probably at least make all defense 3rd team."
"Well, we havent always drafted well but were finally able to cut out losses with the guys that didnt pan out.  Remember we drafted juggernauts like Alex Len, Marquees Chris and Josh Jackson."
Alex Len might be better?
"Aron Baynes is actually worse than Alex Len at rebounding, wow."
"‚ÄúA student of the game‚Äù lmaooooooo get your big head ass outta here. Complaining about having Wiggins, Oubre and a HOFer in Draymond on the squad and then thinking a team starting Jerome Robinson, Alex Len and Deni is comparable"
"You sure? The only non-bust of the top 5 picks was Oladipo and even he‚Äôd be disappointing as a number one overall pick. Next all star was Giannis at 15, the entire first half of the draft was complete shit. Cavs managed to somehow take the stinkiest of all the shit but they‚Äôre still getting mocked years later if they take Alex Len, Otto Porter, or Cody Zeller."
"And just to be clear on those teammates, he had:  - Tyler Ulis (2nd round rookie, now out of the NBA)  - Derrick Jones Jr. (undrafted rookie who had started 4 games to that point)  - Alex Len  - Marquese Chriss (rookie)  - Leandro Barbosa (last game of his career)  - Jared Dudley   - Alan Williams (undrafted second year player, now out of the NBA)"
Alex Len also looked like an NBA player for us
Alex Len would average 200 rebounds without Westbrook
"&gt;Thomas Bryant went down, which was a blow, but one would have expected Westbrook to elevate the wins column more than he has.  You're underrating this a lot. We've been playing a rotation of RoLo and Alex Len.   We've also been without Bertans for a lot of the season, and when he has been playing, he's looked out of shape and his shots been off in at least half the game's he's played. He was scoring 15ppg last season, to go along with TB's 13, that's a lot of fucking points!   The defense on this team has been bad, and while Russ doesn't necessarily help in that regard he's not the reason that it is bad. On the other hand he's been ridiculously good on offense as of late, it just hasn't translated to wins.    He started the season unhealthy and we just got through a brutal stretch against some strong teams, we didn't just lose a to a bunch of lottery teams or something. There's still a very strong chance this team makes the play in games, and if everyone's still healthy by then anything is possible."
"Poor Alex Len, he had to box out for Westbrook and ended up with only 5 rebounds..."
"21 assist with guys like Alex Len, Jerome Robinson, Robin Lopez, Chandler Hutchinson lol"
"Worst of it all was y‚Äôall looked straight up lazy all game. No emotion, no effort, no rotations. Looked like they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to try. I see why the rumors of the players turning on bjorken could be true. 74 points in the paint to a team starting Alex Len is just so bad."
Alex Len isnt bad. Hes a serviceable big man.
"Alex Len is terrible at defense, all he does is swipe his arms at people that have already gone past him"
"hey now, this same alex len scored 20 points, 9 rebs, 2 blks on the nets this season."
"The Raptors paid more money for Alex Len who played 76 minutes with the Raptors this season than the Nets did for Griffin/Aldridge.   So when you compare his talent to people with the same cap hit as him, they won‚Äôt say he sucks."
Stealing rebounds from whom? Alex Len? Daniel Gafford? Absolutely brain dead take
Alex Len.
No center. Alex Len isn‚Äôt even good enough to be a backup and he‚Äôs getting starter minutes
"Alex Len was a 3rd string center that got cut by the 17-22 Raptors. NBA is the best league in the world, and there is no reason to be playing centers that either should be retired ""Slopez"" or Slolex Len who should be playing ni Europe."
"&gt;Robin and Alex are such a defensive liability that it does not make sense at all.   Just for the record and all, Len has the best defensive rating on the Wizards.  You might be painting with a brush that's a little too wide, there."
All Alex Len does is get stuffed and yammed on
Exactly. And they cut Alex Len because he sucks.
"Yeahhhh, but i also dont know what you can do with this team. Watching lopez trying to guard bobby portis let alone giannis was straight pain. Alex len aint helping. Deni is averaging like 3 fouls a game. Neto is scrappy but small.  Mathews is cool tho. Beal is looking aight for now too. Please send in recommendations to brooks lol"
Who else are you gonna put on him? Alex Len?
It would be wise to stick to digital but I would still consider the advantages of AR/VR nonetheless. Energy consumption should dwindle eventually too.  Plain cards though in today's digital age is akin to kodak cameras in the 90s. Yes the ones that are valuable now will increase in value as they always do but nobody is gonna put up for an Alex Len card.
Where do you see Alex Len? All I see is a traffic cone.
"If Alex Len is the ""defender"", is it really a highlight?"
ah Alex Len our first bust
Bucks are playing Alex Len for a fool.  and he‚Äôs very foolish
Alex Len also [did this shit to Zion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZzKKM4xtLE) Fans were about to kill Len for it.
Was probaly mad Giannis took all the letters for his name and left barley any for Alex Len
Alex Len blew a 12 point lead
Remind me to look into NBA clips these really help to dissect the game way easier!  Brooks needs to go. Even if you didn't feel comfortable with playing Wagner for anymore time (he had 22 minutes btw) you could've put in Alex Len who only had 2 MINUTES OF PT  I will cheer for the day Brooks is gone. So many winnable games lost because of his incompetency
"Not to mention JC was out 20+ games, injury and suspension Traea first two years. Like come on people this is ridiculous. WE WERE STARTING ALEX LEN AND DAMIAN JONES"
"I don't disagree but can you actually get good centres that easily on the market? Look at the raptors and the Celtics struggling, or the wizards running old ass RoLo and Alex Len"
Maybe this is why Alex Len got cut by the Raptors. We even took Baynes over him.
"This is a whole lot of content for something that‚Äôs really simple. When I saw Alex Len in the game, I knew it was a wrap. Dude is one of the worst centers in the league idc what the numbers say. Fascinates me how Scott Brooks continues to find work."
"He‚Äôd still be a 2x Scoring Champ, 3x Assist champ, and one of the best playmakers of all time even with his reckless drives and fumbles. He‚Äôs averaging 11.6 APG to Alex Len and Ish Smith. Between this season and 18/19 he‚Äôs put up two of the highest potential assist tallies of this generation. No one here is acting like he‚Äôs a good scorer, especially not in the Steph era post 16/17 and *especially* not with his FT% this year but he‚Äôs still a great player with an equally great amount of flaws."
"Damn, Westbrook has had too much help and instead decides to ignorantly play ‚ÄúWestball.‚Äù  The Wizards have so many weapons in their starting lineup like  Raul Neto Garrison Matthews Rui Hachimura Alex Len"
"I don't watch the Wizards, but I wonder how much of their below average defense is due to Brooks and how much is due to personnel. Beal/Westbrook is not a good defensive backcourt, and last year they were rolling with washed Isaiah Thomas of all guards for 20+ mpg.   They're also starting Alex Len at center and Avdija as a rookie for most of this year. Not saying that Brooks is good, but it's not like he has Gobert and Kawhi and somehow can't figure out how to stop the other team lol"
Alex Len got cut by the raptors. That‚Äôs all I need to say .
"This whole sequence is perfect to be honest.  Alex len looking like an uncoordinated toddler... Capela, who we got from the Rockets to make room for Russ, blocks Russ in a clutch play, Trae embracing the role of a ""pure PG""... Bogi, who is arguably the hottest shooter in the league unselfishly pointing to open trailing Heurter... and then JC knocking down the 3 (unfathomable his rookie year but he's improved so much of his game, including perimeter shooting) that lands us in the playoffs after suffering through 3 straight awful losing seasons..."
Alex Len killed us a couple weeks back lmao.
"I mean Alex Len still plays in the league so he for sure isn‚Äôt the worst. Drummond is a fine player and on what they are paying he is good value, but he isn‚Äôt exactly a world beater either"

Alex Len is hot garbage and watching him be even paid by someone else is hilarious for me as a Hawks fan who endured him
alex len falling alone lmao I think he's still a hawk
Alex Len should not be in the rotation when they have Gafford and RoLo
Alex Len tripped. Him not getting back on defense led to Collins being wide open. Hawks had to deal with that type of bullshit all last year.
"Jabari Parker isos, Vince Carter heat checks, Evan Turner spins, Chandler Parsons existing, Miles Plumlee being a worse Alex Len. good times."
"Entire Atlanta team sure did pop their eyes when they saw Alex Len, former Hawk, will be closing the game  Your players were probably like ""lmao thank god for Scott Brooks we got this shit"" at the 5 min mark in the 4th"
Secret Hawks agent Alex Len.  JC was wide open cause Len fell down from the other side of the court lmao
Daniel Gafford was giving us the nastiest beat down ever in the 3rd. Eyes were popping out and kidneys were exploding and then Alex Len took all the rest of his minutes in the 4th it just doesn't make sense
hence why the last two years our defense was so bad was that Alex Len lead the line for large swaths while we tanked.  Defense is way better now with someone competent there
"I watched almost every single game of our rebuild. The emergence of John Collins, Dedmon learning how to shoot threes, the unrivaled athleticism of Alex Poythress, Ben Simmons talking about how bad we are while playing fortnite and then proceeding to absolutely shit on us, Alex Len batting Traes' lobs directly out of bounds with his cinder block hands... It wasn't always fun but I'm so glad I stuck it out, I love watching this team. Happy to be back!"
Alex Len was on the floor. Thankfully not for us.
"Playing Alex Len was the nail in the coffin, Gafford was killing us"
Yeah I have no idea how you beat the dreaded 3 point guard  + Alex Len combo
Alex len is so bad offensively.. hafford had it rolling and u take him out for len..smh.
If only we had a center better than Alex Len... might help idk
Our coach leaves our 2nd and 3rd best players on the bench and closes out the game with Ish Smith &amp; Alex Len üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉ
You have Gafford and Lopez and decide to play... Alex Len. Fire brooks
We got James fucking Harden out here playing off the bench while Scott Brooks insists that Alex Len is an NBA level starter lol Wiz fans should be storming the arena rn
Alex Len is so bad and Gafford should be getting way more minutes
Scott. Brooks. Rui and Gafford sit while ish and Alex FUCKING Len finish the game. Can‚Äôt remember the last time I was this heated after a loss
Alex Len üòÇüòÇ
"Alex Len shouldnt of been on the floor closing the game , this man always and i mean always mistimes his jumps."
"Daniel Gafford goes 8/11 from the field in 16 min, yet Brooks plays Alex Len and his stone hands down the stretch"
Alex Len is 7ft tall and just bats the ball like a dumb cat instead of just grabbing the rebound
Scott Brooks really gonna close with Alex Len huh
He's legit been great with us. Huge step above Robin Lopez and Alex Len.
They have him as the 3rd center behind alex Len and robin lopez lol
I'm half convinced Alex Len only has 3 fingers total
"They were a terrible defensive team without russ last year too. Any team giving Alex Len any amount of minutes is going to have not so great defense, hawks fans should know this."
Alex Len has returned to state farm arena üòÇ
and he (22 years old) is gonna have less minutes than robin lopez (33) and alex len (27) for some reason
Making Alex Len look competent is a top 5 Russ accomplishment.
Yeah this is always the case for the guards with high rebounds numbers.  Just collecting a ton of uncontested rebounds but people love seeing that big number in the box line!  Derrick Favors and Westbrook average the same amount of contested boards a game.  Favors averages 5.5 rebounds.  Westbrook averages 11.6.  Alex Len averages the the same amount of contested boards as Luka.  Per game he averages half the rebounds Luka does.
With alex len and raul neto starting üíÄ
Imagine if we had thomas bryant instead of alex len or robin lopez lol.
There are many players better than he is who are ringless. And he def ain‚Äôt winning one on a squad where Alex Len logs 15 minutes a night.
"Embiid and KAT were incredibly skilled players in college and they were big time defensive prospects (weird how that turned out for KAT) while Ayton and Bagley were defensive liabilities as big men. Dwight is definitely what a lot of people hope for they draft guys like Wiseman for sure.  If you look at old drafts and see what kind of players are busts, it is more likely an athletic big who don't know how to play basketball (Alex Len or Thomas Robinson) or an athletic wing who can't shoot or dribble (Wesley Johnson or Wiggins). Very skilled or very smart prospects are rarely busts (and they are likely big men like Okafor or Kanter).  Obviously, many smart or skilled players don't reach their potential but that is no different from athletic prospects. Yet, athletic prospects are always drafted higher even when they don't show any skill or BBIQ."
Wizards swept most of top west teams therefore Alex Len &gt; Kawhi + Lebron
You think Alex Len and RoLo are gonna contain embiid at all?
Look at the stats he's literally using. Embiid is a worse rim protector then Alex Len
Embiid is a worse defender than Alex Len and Daniel Gafford
I think he would have been serviceable yeah. A better version of Alex Len is the more appropriate comp
"I don't know if I buy that premise. The Raptors have managed to cobble together a decent defense with the corpse of Aaron Baynes and the stone feet of Alex Len guarding the paint. The Blazers have been absolute trash on defense this year with less excuses.  The Blazers duo is dynamic on offense, but if you watched them get absolutely blown up on screens and blown by on the perimeter, you would appreciate the point of attack defense that Lowry and VanVleet provide."
"Refuses to play off ball? Let's be honest, he SHOULDN'T play off ball. That's why he doesn't. Even as a Russ ""Stan"" it's easy to admit he's a bad shooter and a lazy cutter (like most stars) so him being off ball doesn't make sense. It's more that he needs to be on ball then he refuses to be.   Yes a guy who's lead the league in assists 3 times is a ball hog, yupp.   He demands to get every free throw? Once again, it's by design FROM THE COACH. You see that pass he had off a rebound the other day? The kind of passes Jokic and KLove (in his prime) do all the time? If Alex Len gets the rebound no way in hell they get those points.   The issues with Dame and Rubio are definitely valid and infuriating as a fan of his but your on court criticisms are bs."
"We're losing in style, honestly with all our injuries we've been pretty competetive in some of these games. Looking forward to next year, after watching Alex Len and Aaron Baynes all year , I appreciate having birch so damn much lmao"
And Alex Len
&gt;Robin Lopez and Alex Len are not better rebounding centers.  No they are not but they were better against Brook Lopez tonight.  &gt;If we don't play Gafford in those last seven minutes we don't even have a chance to win the game.  You were lucky because Brook had his 5th foul and was benched. Otherwise he would've dominated Gafford.
Robin Lopez and Alex Len are not better rebounding centers. If we don't play Gafford in those last seven minutes we don't even have a chance to win the game.
Alex Len should have grabbed the board and initiate the fastbreak.
high level role player is still a pretty fruitful career...i just found out last night that alex len is still in the league...
Raptors legend Alex Len.
LOL no way.  ALEX LEN?!??!?
"1. Thanks for pointing out how good Ayton is at guarding Giannis, always good to see someone talking about how much of a beast our Ayton is on defense.   2. As a Suns fan I find it very hard to believe that the solution to Giannis is to put Robin L√≥pez and Alex Len on him. I may be biased, but that strikes me a disaster in the making."
"Alex Len dropped 18 and 9 on him, not sure how Vogel didn't realize how much of a defensive liability he is after that game"
alex len
I just don't understand why Alex Len is not rebounding that and passing it to Russ who is streaking ahead. Ball is faster than man is what I was told once in school when I was 5.   /s
"Yes, I'm not disagreeing with the upside potential of a guard grabbing the rebound. I'm merely joking about your example of Alex Len getting the rebound considering his hands of stone."
"They aren't but the Wizards still start Raul Neto and Alex Len. I'm not shitting on the Wizards. They just don't have a great roster outside of Russ, Rui and Beal.  We both know this."
"&gt;Imagine if Alex Len got the rebound  I'm having trouble just picturing this. I can see the ball ricocheting off his hands half a dozen ways, but actually gathering it in? can't do it."
High-jacking this to state that this is why you let your PG grab rebounds. Imagine if Alex Len got the rebound then gave it to Russ.  Does anyone think Beal would still be open by the time Russ got it?
If im the wizards I ran far more of that lol. Do you know how much easier it would be for russ and beal if they ran a 5 out offense? Spacing is the name of the game not having a guy like robin lopez or alex len in at the final moments. Granted I really like Gafford but it is incredibly hard for russ and beal to do what they do best when bigs are clogging the paint like theyve done all season. Why do you think russ's efficiency/scoring is down this season?
"Alex Len, Josh Jackson, Marquise Chris. I have to believe McDonough just got lucky with Booker and Warren."
"let's be realer. you can come up with pros and cons for every draft pick. the teams just don't know for the vast majority of players. the suns chose markieff morris at 13 instead of kawhi at 15, and alex len at 5 instead of giannis at 15."
If those stats are good enough for Alex Len then goddammit they're good enough for Bruce Brown
Really more than Alex Len?
"I mean, you can dowplay Alex Len..."
LMFAO  Alex Len
Since when does Alex Len get brought up in these stats
both per36 stats and Alex Len suck
"Not going to go blow by blow, but   &gt;Drummond was voted on to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in 2013 by the NBA coaches.  First team was Anthony Davis. Other rookie centers in 2013: Meyers Leonard, Alex Len, Tyler Zeller, Fab Melo, Miles Plumlee, and Festus Ezeli.  I don't know if being better than Fab Melo necessarily indicates you're a good player. Also, that was nearly a decade ago."
"I think you are understating just how important having Camby protecting the rim instead of Alex Len, even if Camby missed games. The Nuggets were better when Carmelo was off the court.  Amar‚Äôe‚Äôs TS in 2005 and 2007 dropped by 4% in the reg season and 11% in the playoffs without Nash not to mention his defensive deficiencies has a big men have a much greater impact then Beal‚Äôs as a guard."
"He doesnt box out, letting dudes like Alex Len look like stars on the glass. Like Trez had a bad rep for boxing out too, but hes definitely put in the work this year &amp; gotten better thru the year. When ball handlers drive into the paint on iso or PnR, Trez is better at staying out of the way &amp; slipping into space to finish, unlike Drummond who just gets in the way too often. Drummond doesn't run the floor hard offensively or defensively, which is unfortunategiven how agile he is for a man his size. Im pretty sure Vogel will cut his minutes in the playoffs, hopefully hes willing to play with more energy in decreased minutes."
"&gt;Russ averaged 22 on 36% in the playoffs against Dame, while Dame had 33 on 46%  Yeah but Russ also averaged 9 rebounds and 11 assists. Him being able to get his teammates involved is why he didn't get swept, unlike Dame against the freaking Pelicans.  &gt;Or the fact that Dame ts% is 60 this season while Russ is 50%  Westbrook is shooting 43.7% on FGs this year, Lillard is shooting 43.3%. You're just cherrypicking true shooting because it favors players who jack up a bunch of 3s.  &gt;Dame 20-11 in clutch games, Russ 14-14.  Well Westbrook has to play with Raul Neto, Alex Len, and Davis Bertans as role players. Lillard gets Powell, Covington, and Nurkic as role players so obviously he's gonna have a better record."
Alex Len
"Get what you're saying, but lets not act like Booker not making the playoffs was his own doing....he's had teams starting Alex len and Tyler fucking Ulis lol."
"Yes, many teams nowadays don't even start a 7 footer and if they do, he plays low minutes, Russ's own team does this with Alex Len.  Len plays 15 minutes a game and is their ""starting center"", but most of the time the tallest guy on the court for the Wizards is 6-8 Rui Hachimura. Even in OKC when that wasn't the case, Steven Adams didn't focus as much on defensive rebounding as big mens traditionally do and you can see that by his very low defensive rebounding averages in that span for a guy his size.  With that said, Russ is probably the only player in NBA history that can do what he's been doing, maybe the Big O could do the same in today's game, but it's almost impossible to predict what a guy that played 60 years ago could do now. Neither could average a triple double in the 90s and early 2000s though."
"Goran Dragic requesting a trade. Eric Bledsoe not wanting to be here. Kieff fighting Hornacek on the bench. Drafting Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, and Josh Jackson. Getting robbed by Trevor Ariza for $15 million. Watching Tyson Chandler rot away. Seeing Alex Len drop another pass. Yoga and layup lines with Earl Watson. Bringing 38 year old Jamal Crawford off the bench. Starting point guards Tyler Ulis, Mike James, Elfrid Payton, Tyler Johnson, Isaiah Canaan, and rookies Elie Okobo and De'Anthony Melton.    And here we are."
Alex Len probably has the nudes of every nba GM. He should‚Äôve been out of the league after that one clusterfuck of a game he had with the Hawks.
Rim protector Alex Len
Why the fuck do we want to verse the nuggets if Alex Len and Lopez and taj gibson and Dwight Powell and any random C in the league are cooking us?
Alex Len getting superstar calls
Why the fuck are we starting Alex Len?
Alex len*
"We‚Äôll never be able to really tell when he plays next to Alex Len, Ish Smith, Garrison Matthews and Raul Neto.   Currently there‚Äôs no way to tell his value as a first or second option because the Wizards haven‚Äôt put a decent roster around him."
"Or Raul Neto, Garrison Matthews, Ish Smith, Alex Len  By the way, 2 of these players start for the Wizards and the other 2 play rotation minutes for the Wizards"
8% of the total 3s were made by Alex Len
Alex Len and Anthony Gill are a combined 13/15 for 28 points. They've both hit a 3 despite both of them being 24% shooters
Alex Len. Look up the YT compilations.
"Yeah, I thought this year was a wrap when we replaced the most versatile center rotation in the league with Aaron Baynes and Alex Len."
u forgot about alex len
Nobody shuts down Biyombo or Alex Len better
French Alex Len
Kelly Oubre and Alex Len
"Ok man, your team should hire him then. Hope you enjoy 3 guard lineups, Alex Len starting over Gafford and Lopez consistently, and having your playmaking rookie SF rot in the corner as a spot shooter"
"Suns draft josh Jackson, Alex Len and dragon bender top 5, finally make the playoffs and don‚Äôt know how to act"
Nobody can shut down Alex Len and Bismack Biyombo like Rudy Gobert I will give you that
"With all due respect, as someone that has watched every game since the trade. No one was gonna get those teams to the playoffs. Alex Len was our best 3pt shooter at the end of the 18-19 season."
"Homie, the Suns suited up a total of 8 players for that game and the starting lineup consisted of Derrick Jones Jr, Alex Len, Marquese Chriss, and Tyler Ulis lol. I think Chriss was like 1/10 that game too. Nobody on the team could put the ball in the basket. Booker shot over 50% in that game. He was playing winning basketball, but the clowns around him couldn't do shit that game"
I have an Alex Len jersey. Worth it somehow
He never signed my pizza box when I saw him and Alex Len after a Denver game at Grand Ave Pizza. I'm still mad at him for that. Shout out to Alex for the pic tho!
Don't forget Alex Len
"Dont forget Marquise Chriss, Alex Len, Isaiah Canaan and Mike James"
I hope he starts Alex Len
What will yall do if Brooks continues to play Alex Len over Daniel Gafford?
"I'm not so sure. The Suns didn't seem inclined to invest very heavily into Stixx this year. Saric was injured a good deal this year and he still played more than 5 times as many minutes as Stixx (Jalen Smith had the third fewest minutes logged out of anyone on the team and was healthy all season).   It seems like the Suns are trying to avoid the mistakes of previous Suns teams in how we heavily invested in our first round draft picks despite poor play: Dragan Bender, Marquis Chriss, Alex Len, Josh Jackson. Since Monty and James Jones have taken over they've prioritized the current value of a player over their potential as a lot of time has been wasted hoping for players to develop.   I could be wrong, It's entirely possible the organization sees Stixx growing into a productive player but he hasn't shown much thus far."
Alex Len loves playing with ‚Äúempty stats‚Äù guys like Trae and Booker
Alex Len loves playing with ‚Äúempty stats‚Äù guys like Trae and Booker
"""first of all, alex len....ehhhmmm whats that kids name....meyers leonard is the best terminator. we all know that"""
"This city will be diehards if our teams are even 8 seeds. We are realistic though. The Josh Jackson, Alex Len Suns didn‚Äôt give us much to cheer about outside of Booker. This is a Suns town, they just need to give us something to look forward to."
Smith was the 9th pick and looks like another Dragon Bender or Alex Len type of pick
"And Justin Jackson, And Marquise Criss, and the Morris twins‚Ä¶ Oh yeah and Alex Len, the man didn‚Äôt have a chance"
"Mavs fans loved to say Trae couldn‚Äôt play winning basketball when he had Jabari Parker, 2 rookies, and Alex Len as his supporting cast. So I guess it has a little to do with that. Apparently supporting casts only matter for one of them."
"And ends up drafting Anthony Bennett, Victor Oladipo, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len with the top 5 picks"
Starting five all average   Bryn forbes  Lonnie Walker  James ennis  Mike Scott  Alex Len
mavs gona sign Alex Len and Davis Bertans this offseason
We were starting Alex Len and had 40 year old Vince Carter playing starter minutes.
NBA media is the worst major sports media IMO. A lot of these shows are only good for hot takes to get views and engagement with an argument and not actually use context for a discussion. Using the Trae example these talking-heads knew very well that until this year he was not surrounded by talent(Damian Jones and Alex Len were starters ü§¢).
Hawks fans have no issue with mavericks fans. Hawks fans have issues with luka stans who have constantly be invading subs and talking shit about trae since the day he was drafted. What luka has done is impressive but he gets no where near the criticisms trae gets. Prior to the knicks series people had trae as the 16th best player under 25 and spouted the foul baiting narrative. Luka Stan‚Äôs have been saying for years shit like trae is not a winning player when his roster employed Alex Len Jabari Parker and Evan turner
"Random question. How popular Kristaps is in Latvia? Like amongst regular folk. Here in Ukraine average citisen has no idea who Svi or Alex Len are, but Latvia is more of a bbal country, so he should be big there, right?"
"The starting lineup when he dropped 70 in Boston included Marquese Chriss, Alex Len, Derrick Jones Jr, and Tyler Ulis. They also only had 3 bench players available for that game as well.    This dude has been on some of the worst rosters ever. It was seriously a revolving door of g-league talent with coach firings every season.    I'm so happy he's getting the respect he deserves as a star in this league."
"Bro Alex Caruso wouldn't do this. In fact he literally didn't do this, he was playing hard all game despite not being able to significantly impact the game on his own. Even verified bums like Alex Len and Aaron Holiday played with a lot of effort in elimination games"
Alex Len still playing right?
Alex Len syndrome
"unclear.  He seems to be well liked by players &amp; media and is a hard working guy so I am sure that gets you pretty far.  It could also be that he's good at managing relationships &amp; communicating with players, generally that stuff is harder to see during games on TV, whereas insisting on playing Alex Len is glaringly obvious"
"Book won't sniff 70 again because he'll never be in that dire of a situation where he was the only person who could put the ball through the hoop in that fateful day in Boston where the Suns rolled out 8 total players and the starting lineup included Marquese Chriss, Derrick Jones Jr., Tyler Ulis, and Alex Len lol    Teammates are too good and Suns have multiple scoring options and competent players and coaches now"
I think his draft stock was seriously hurt by the number of euro busts we had in the few years before Luka was drafted. Alex Len and Dragon Bender both flopped hard.   It's also difficult to translate Euroleague success to the NBA. Jan Vesely just won Euroleague MVP and he was also a huge flop in the NBA. Anthony Parker and Juan Carlos Navarro also have Euroleague MVPs but were just quality role players in the NBA. LeMelo didn't play particularly well in the NBL but immediately translated perfectly to the NBA.
"Fuck, Alex Len haha don‚Äôt remind me"
Nah man he is trash. Couldn‚Äôt even make the playoffs with Alex Len at center.
Progressively better throughout the year. He's put on a good bit of muscle and has incredible hands for a big man. He's sorta like the anti Alex Len. I don't think I've seen him fumble many touches/loose balls for the last couple of months.   If he develops a shot he has the potential to be a bona-fide star and his FT% shows that he can probably pull that off.
I'd rather put Tobias Harris on Alex Len to be honest
COUGH COUGH Alex len and Raul Neto
"Can‚Äôt believe Booker didn‚Äôt carry the Suns to the playoffs when he had Dragan Bender, Alex Len and Isaiah Canaan starting next to him"
To think some people called him ‚Äúempty stats‚Äù because he couldn‚Äôt carry Dragan Bender and Alex Len to the playoffs in the west.
Alex Len
"Even without embiid I dont see the wiz taking more than 1 game off the sixers, they are just loaded top to bottom and play some of the best defense in the league  Its not like washington has great center depth either, they have gafford then a massive dropoff to alex len  Sixers are just bigger and they have much better shooters and defenders  If the wiz manage to turn this series around and win without embiid philly is going to give serious serious consideration to trading ben simmons"
"Wiz fans hate him because of his mind-numbing ‚Äúrotations‚Äù and ‚Äúadjustments‚Äù. For example, once we got Gaff it was clear he was the best center on our team and we should start him; even from the eyes of casual fans and analysts were calling for him to start too.  Scott Brook‚Äôs answer? Start Alex Len and give Gaff only 8-12 minutes of play time, while Len‚Äôs playtime was in the 20‚Äôs (where, as expected, he was mostly shit).  Opposing team goes on a 10-0 run or it‚Äôs a 1 possession game in crunch time? Don‚Äôt call a timeout, sub anyone,draw up a play, or tell the team to run a set. Just let the players ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù (spoiler, unless Brad or Russ work magic, they don‚Äôt figure it out).   Lengthy 76ers team where we should probably try and match length for defensive purposes? Nah, run a 3 guard lineup of 6‚Äô1‚Äù-6‚Äô3‚Äù guards. That‚Äôll definitely stop Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris. Go down 3-0 before he even THINKS about starting Gaff and when he did he does amazing.  Dude is so inept at his job, and the ONLY reason he still has a job is because for some reason he keeps getting lucky having superstars and MVPs play for him. Also, his defensive scheme is cheeks. He literally just has players switch on every play creating terrible mismatches on people like Ish and Davis, and it cost us so many games. He also doesn‚Äôt wanna run any plays for the 16M a year sharpshooter and instead wants him to shoot all his shots either contested, or flying off the dribble from a pick.  TLDR; Scott Brooks is trash."
"Gafford is the best of the bunch but all your centers are getting outplayed badly by Embiid, I don't think it's too egregious to try and maximize gaffords minutes while embiid sits  you start gafford and he gets eaten by embiid on both ends, if you have to throw up a sacrificial lamb alex len seems like the best option"
"People jump to really exaggerated conclusions based on the two things (lineups and in-game playcalling) that are most visible and that we feel like we know enough to opine on. Of course, a whole staff of professionals working full time on this have already thought through when/why you might start Alex Len over Gafford, but it feels dumb watching it as a casual fan so we call Brooks an idiot and say he needs to be fired."
More Alex Len
"Yup pretty much this plus the rotations are fucking terrible, especially at the 5.  Most agree that Alex Len is the worst of the three we have right not but Scott insisted on starting him until last game.  Also that three guard lineup makes me wanna commit crimes"
"Marv Albert would've been like ""... *slurp slurp* ... *mumble* ... and that was ... *exhale* ... alex len out of wichita state"""
"For the Wizards:  - No Alex Len, less Raul Neto minutes - No more Wizards 3 guard bullshit in the lineup - Hitting threes   - Better Westbrook shot selection - Bradley Beal shows up - More hack-a-Ben  For the Sixers: - Embiid out for series - Sixers cannot replace production of Embiid (see Tobias Harris chuck fest tonight) - Doc Rivers plays Mike Scott more than Dwight - Big men foul trouble - Lakers Danny Green reincarnates  - Ben Simmons continues to go 1-2 from the line every trip  Think I covered everything. This series is over in 5, maybe 6 if the Wizards get lucky."
Lol you do know Gafford has been the only net positive center?  Alex Len will be out of the league
Alex Len isnt any better lol
Definitely helps when you're playing against a team coached by Scott Brooks and Alex Len as the starting C
The alex Len effect
"Very true, but we started Alex Len and Jabari Parker last season. Allen Crabbe was our sixth man. It's like night and day."
"Or Alex Len and Damian Jones, like it was for the Hawks for 2 years."
Homie really said what‚Äôs the difference between Alex Len and Anthony Davis and got upvoted lol.
The disrespect to Alex len
It is symbolic. Alex Len is 77
"That‚Äôs easy to do when Alex Len, Daniel Gafford and Robin Lopez are playing defense on you"
Alex Len - Ukraine
"""Man Alex Len played Embiid best of anyone on this team, and teams historically are best when they double and triple Embiid... let's put Rui on Embiid and call it a night"""
"Wizards are terrible outside of Beal and Russ, Russ has been bad this series but I'm kinda sick of haters putting this on him when Davis Bertans is a starter and they have Rolo and Alex Len guarding the MVP Runner-up. Russ isn't like he used to be, but some of y'all spend so much energy hating him"
"Unless Alex Len Turns into Bill Russell-Ben Wallace hybrid, they have no chance."
Alex Len is a joke. Honestly pisses me off to watch him
"Jokic still better, prolly not best to gauge Embiid performance when he‚Äôs up against Alex Len and gafford üòÇ"
Alex Len must be Gafford‚Äôs favorite player in the league. Gafford gets front row seats to watch that chump add on to his minutes and his next contract
Alex Len is so bad. I‚Äôll never stop arguing Trae had the worst center rotation in recent nba history easily
Alex Len is straight up a scrub
How is Alex Len in the league? No way you should miss that open shot then follow it up with a stupid foul. He‚Äôs ass every time I watch him play
Alex Len highkey stupid
Alex Len u fucking donkey
"You are Scott Brooks. 2 games down, needing a change. You switch up your starting lineup. You keep Alex Len starting. You are somehow still a coach"
"Bullock really isn't that bad. He's a good defender and an accurate three-point shooter. Alex Len, Ariza, Austin Rivers (even if he was good yesterday) are all worse in my opinion"
Alex Len
Gotta be Alex Len for me
"Alex Len has been pretty ridiculous in the Sixers - Wizards series. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen him set one clean screen all series (to be fair, he‚Äôs gonna foul out quick anyway; this would just be flat out mean)  Worst player I‚Äôve ever seen with illegal screens is Horford. Dude has done it for years. So much movement, holding, elbowing, etc. i"
"Who needs a center?  Here are some potential free agents.   Drummond, Gorgui Dieng, Cody Zeller, Kelly Olynyk, Meyers Leonard, Ibaka (PO), Montrez Harrell (PO), PJ Tucker, Robin Lopez, Ed Davis, Enes Kanter, Richaun Holmes, Theis, Noel, Biyombo, McGee, Alex Len, Khem Birch, Boogie, Dwight, Whiteside.   Noel might have to sign for the mid-level again."
"To expand on this, the Suns signed him using the non-taxpayer mid-level exception, which is the main way for over-the-cap playoff teams to add role players in free agency.  The Suns used theirs on Crowder, Portland used theirs on Derrick Jones Jr, we split ours across JaMychal Green (7.5) and Bol Bol (2-ish), Utah used theirs on Derrick Favors, Boston on Tristan Thompson, Toronto split theirs across Aron Baynes (7) and Alex Len (2-ish) and Washington used some of theirs to give Robin Lopez 7.2  Just looking at what other teams did with their MLE last year, I would bet Crowder had other bidders and Phoenix had to go the 3 years to bring him in."
lmao you're acting like brooks will make any adjustments at all... we'll continue to start raul neto on tobias harris and alex len on joel embiid.
He starts Neto. He starts Alex Len.  He puts his superstar offensive player on the other teams primary ball handler as if Beal was that dude.
"If they played the Nets, he might have better numbers but they still get swept lmfao   They get swept no matter who they play. They start Alex Len and Raul Neto."
"Bruh what. How is this the take you get from this? As a wizards fan too smh. Dude has Alex Len as his starting center and you guys are in the playoffs, show some respect"
"Welcome back homie, you got to miss out on Alex Len"
"Ben Simmons posting up and Beal has to guard him. Joel is the best player  in the series and the other team has to play Alex Len against him, Jesus this is such a mismatch"
Bro Alex Len started in the same lineup as him today (No disrespect to Alex Len)  *Edit well I guess a little disrespect
"Just doing the playoffs teams, some players are pretty random:  Jazz: Donovan Mitchell  Memphis: Marc Gasol/Conley  Clippers: Griffin  Mavs: Dirk  Denver: Murray  Portland: Lillard  Phoenix: Nash  Lakers: Kobe  Philly: MCW  Washington: Wall  Knicks: Me7oooo  Atlanta: Alex Len  Bucks: Giannis  Miami: LeBron  Nets: Brook Lopez or Deron Williams  Celtics: Kevin Garnett"
"in all honesty though, Scott Brooks using Alex Len to feel out refs and then swapping RoLo and Daniel Gafford based on team needs is actually very good coaching. Anyone who's watched DC this year has been graced with the spectacle that is RoLo's signature KAJ impersonation hook shot which has been actually one of DC's secret offensive weapons this year. Between that and Gafford's unreal energy balancing their minutes with the absorption role Alex Len plays by picking up fouls and getting the dirty work done he's made the 3 headed center beast work out pretty well in DC."
He must think Alex Len is Shaq incarnate
The Wizards atart Alex Len
Alex Len can at least get 4-6 points a game. Elfird literally hasn‚Äôt scored 1 point in like the past 5 games
Alex Len starts
As if a Russell Westbrook 3 and Alex Len are the only options the team has.
Ur right he should give up his shots to Alex Len
Bro why don't you run full speed into a screen set by Alex Len or get bumped midair by Robert Williams lmk how it feels
Alex Len somewhat has value as a big body to use on Embiid and absorb fouls that Gafford or Lopez could have picked up.
Alex Len?
Gotta add Alex Len in there to complete the trio of  players who absolutely shouldn't be starting
Can we stop saying that the big is dead? We're just at a point where bigs like Alex Len just don't cut it anymore. A lot is being asked of the modern day center and with players like Ayton it's getting recognized.
Trade that garbage called Alex Len he can‚Äôt make a layup
Suns fan since I watched Alex Len and Archie Goodwin play. Hats off to the bucks for playing awesome these last three games. They have all been heartbreaking but I am also happily surprised the suns are here and i hope the bucks fans can feel the same. Looking forward to game 6 and hopefully 7
This logic makes sense until you realize he averaged the same amount of assists last season with Alex Len and Damian Jones as his big men.  Trae is just a better passer
"Lol yes I meant brogdon. Damn autocorrect. But for sure Brogdon/Sexton, Ant, Brown is a solid perimeter lineup. I‚Äôd be worried about the front court though after getting through the Alex Len/Damian Jones/Dwayne Dedmon years"

"Kidd: Ja Morant (Obviously J Kidd didn't have the athleticism, but pace and poor shooting) Kmart: Jon Collins Van Horn: Kelly O Kittles: Reggie Bullock RJ: Mikal Bridges MaCCullough: Alex Len"
It wasn‚Äôt a great pick but I mean there wasn‚Äôt a consensus guy at the top. I mean the next couple dudes were Oladipo Porter Zeller and Alex Len so granted Bennett stunk but it‚Äôs not like there were studs to be had in that draft. It was like a huge collection of shit to be sorted through.
I‚Äôm gonna list a group of players and you let me know if you‚Äôd consider them at young core  20 year old Devon Booker  19 year old Marquese Chriss  23 year old Alex Len  19 year old Dragan Bender  21 year old Tyler Ulis
"no, because you‚Äôre starting Alex Len at the 5"
Let‚Äôs be honest... Alex Len was the true king of PHX centers
Okay but is Alex Len a top 300 Sun of all time?
"The narrative was it was Coach Westbrook and assistant Brooks that led to the wins.  His line ups were pretty funky (3 PG is just weird even if it works sometimes)  Dude keeps trying to fit Alex Len in a starter role despite having 2 servicable big men in rotation. He kept it up until the elimination game of the playoffs. Like the team might tolerate it, but it just didnt work the majority of the games"
"Put it this way. Embiid is just as big of a flopper as any of the other tier 1 floppers. I‚Äôm sure he shot more free throws that series. Not even mentioning the fact that both Embiid and Trae get legitimately fouled a lot. Some rule change causing Embiid to shoot 2-3 less free throws a game is not going to turn him into Alex Len, he brings so much else to the table like rebounding, defense, shooting, being the focal point of the offense, etc.  Trae is the same way, take away 2 free throws and dude will still be averaging 25points 10assists and drawing defenders out to the logo to create opportunities for his team. He shot like shit in the Sixers series, probably due to the two all-defense guards, but he was still very effective and aggressive."
Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
"They saw him putting up 29-9 while playing with Alex Len, a washed up DeWayne Dedmon, and a 75 year old Vince Carter, and assumed Trae was the reason they couldn't win"
"Trae has zero allstars on his supporting cast and his second and third options were hurt. Before Trae‚Äôs injury the hawks would‚Äôve been up 2-1 against the Bucks with Giannis. It‚Äôs just funny to me Luka stans loved talking about ‚Äúwinning basketball‚Äù last year when Trae had 2 rookies, Alex Len, and Jabari Parker as teammates and now all of a sudden team talent is important. Weird how that works. Either way, it looks like the hawks are in a better position after making the trade than the mavs are. Especially given Reddish‚Äôs performance game 6."
This man had to play with Alex Len and washed up Vince Carter and people were wondering why the Hawks weren‚Äôt in the playoffs lol
He was dubbed ‚Äúbaby kawhi‚Äù by none other than Alex Len
"They were bad last year but I think they dealt with the most or close to the most covid disruptions than any other team in the league and it wasn't until they made their run at the end of the year where they finally had a consistent run with their main guys all there. They also lost Thomas Bryant who was their starting center a couple games into the season which force them to play a lot of Alex Len and Robin Lopez before they got Gafford.    I think they'll probably convince themselves that with more health luck, getting Bryant back and maybe making a couple depth acquisitions on the wing that they could be higher up maybe like the 5 or 6 seed which maybe isn't great but for them might be worth just running it back with Beal and Russ."
"Others also projected Otto Porter Jr, Alex Len and Ben McLemore at Number 1"
"For real though. That box score brings me back to darker days. A starting lineup of Booker, Tyler Ulis, Derrick Jones, Alex Len, and Marquese Chriss. Dudley, Barbosa, and Big Sauce off the bench. Ain't nobody else was gonna score.   70/8/6 with 3 steals is still pretty impressive for a 20yo. Luckily we've seen him have huge performances to win games in the postseason now."
"With all nba players such as: 42 year old VC, Jeremy Lin, Jeff Teague, Alex Len, Damion Jones, Miles Plumlee, Jabari Parker, Deandre Bembry, etc"
With 10 assists passing to fucking Alex Len and Vince Carter‚Äôs corpse
"He lead the NCAA in scoring an assists as a freshman. Hell, he averaged nearly 30 and 10 last year on a team that was giving heavy minutes to Alex Len, DeAndre Bembry, Jabari Parker, and 43 year old VC.   Yes, he would still be a great player wherever he went."
Suns know exactly where starting Alex Len gets you lol!
"I mean we believe you here. We got told every day that for two years Trae was empty stays because he couldn‚Äôt win starting Alex Len, Deandre Bembry, unpolished rookie Kevin Huerter, 42 year old Vince carter got SIGNIFICANT minutes, starting at the 4 quite a bit for us. I repeat, Vince Carter was our starting 4 and JC missed 25+ games both of Traes first two years in the league. We had 90+ MILLION DOLLARS in salary dedicated to Chandler parsons who played 9 minutes the entire season for us, Allen Crabbe who averaged 3 points on almost 20 minutes a game, and Evan fucking Turner. We had 3 of the worst 5 contracts in the entire league and this sub still laughed because Trae wasn‚Äôt winning averaging 30 and 10. That‚Äôs when I realized this sub does not look at context what so ever."
You think CP3 will bring us to the finals? Last time I checked we had Baynes and Alex Len as centers instead of Ayton. And who's our Booker?
"Yall tanked and your gm made stupid decisions with the picks yall ended up with, that isn't a contradiction that is the truth.   Josh jackson, Alex Len, dragon bender, marquess chriss  And don't get me started on the coaching hires, earl Watson, Igor kokoskov.  McDonough was an idiot, be glad Sarver finally decided to clear house and become more hands off"
Don't forget Josh Jackson also with the 4th overall pick. Or Marquise Chriss or Alex Len or... Well you get the point
"Alex Len, a little help bro"
"Yes, Trae‚Äôs team of zero allstars. It‚Äôs hilarious that Luka fans suddenly care about team talent. Never remember hearing it when Trae had 2 rookies, Jabari Parker, and Alex Len as his supporting cast."
Alex Len hurt you that much huh
chuck getting alex len flashbacks lol
"He got thrown into some serious minutes right away at the start of his career. Especially the last two years, he was essentially the PG when Trae was out. Decision making really improved with reps. Became a very good defender this year which gets very overlooked. Just no one ever paid attention because the Hawks were rolling out deandre bembry and alex len out there"
By far my least favorite player until the Alex Len/Aron Baynes debacle   He had literally no skill or ability   I would get mad anytime he came onto the court
"Lakers fans on the Suns wagon has felt weird since the start. Were they not alive when [Raja Bell was cheap-shotting Kobe?](https://youtu.be/vOktw0GbWN4)  Or when [Alex Len was cheap-shotting Nick Young?](https://youtu.be/SwOTGCaO-fQ)  The Clippers putting up some cringe billboards isn't really comparable.  Heck, [the Suns consider clotheslining Kobe a franchise **highlight**.](https://youtu.be/6qQ53iB6jhU) Imagine celebrating a cheap shot."
"Yeah my top 3 Cs is something like Kareem, Zubac, and then between Bill Russell and Alex Len for number 3. I go back and forth on that one."
Yeah Kanter is better than Alex Len or Robin Lopez
"Ya thats his only knock but it's gotten way better, at least he's not like our old center trampoline hands, Alex Len"
"its because players like luka, larry, alex len, gordon hayward, kyle singler, and nowitzki play with class according to bill simmons"
How he was averaging 10 assists having to give the ball to Alex Len and DeAndre Bembry I will never know
"In that sense, do you think Alex Len and Dragan Bender can be considered busts?"
imo capela was a bigger deal. holy shit was alex len awful
What? No he didn't. Alex Len always looked bad.
This. Trae used to make Alex Len look good
Dont forget the goat Alex Len
"You think he built a team with 2 rookies playing about 30 mpg (Hunter and Reddish), Jabari Parker, DeWayne Dedmon, DeAndre Bembry, Jeff Teague, Allen Crabbe, Alex Len, Vince Carter, and Even Turner....And was seriously attempting to win basketball games? That's what you call tanking buddy."
"they aren't a middle aged vince carter, alex len and whatever else lol. Trae makes his team better but he's not a magician."
"First of all, false. Second of all, where were all the people comparing rosters when the Hawks were starting Alex Len, Taurean Prince, and DeWayne Dedmon?"
Holding a banner in Atlien and Phonexian saying THANK YOU ALEX LEN
"It honestly isn't the same though. Yeah the Mavs team is bad but Trae was playing with Dedmon, Alex Len, and a 96 year old Vince Carter.   I agree Luka has elevated that Mavs team far above where thy should be though."
"We have like the 2nd or 3rd best record in the league since Nate became our coach and have a deep, talented roster but people are acting like we are still the 2019 hawks starting 42 year old Vince and Damian Jones/Alex Len at center lol"
"&gt; If Luka was in the East he would have been in the finals **last year**.  This is peak /r/NBA right here.  I'm betting you have absolutely no idea who was on the Hawks roster last year.  Luka would not have made the playoffs in the East with that roster.  &amp;nbsp;  The center rotations were Dedmon, Bruno Fernando, Alex Len, and Damian Jones.  None of those guys can even get minutes today.  We also started 2 rookies, Reddish and Hunter.  Hunter was bad last year, Reddish was bad to mediocre at times.  Heurter was our starting SG, good for about 12 ppg on terrible efficiency.  Our most seasoned player, 3rd year Collins, was suspended for 25 games.  &amp;nbsp;  Round off our rotation with Jabari Parker, Bembry, and Vince Carter chucking his way into retirement and you think that Luka instead of Trae is going to the finals lmfao this sub really never misses"
"Hate to be captain hindsight here but the rise of Trae was not completely surprising I don't think considering how much McMillain reigned in his game after taking over. Having actual good teammates instead of retirement age Vince Carter and Alex Len to pass to definitely helps as well, Bogdan returning from injury was huge"
"I don‚Äôt remember any Luka fan talking about team talent last year when Trae had 2 rookies, Jabari Parker, and Alex Len, yet they loved to talk about Trae not making the playoffs and Luka making it."
"Haha, I had to check to make sure Huerter was post-ACC (he was, he was a freshman in Year 3 of B1G Maryland).    Tbf to your point, I credit Alex Len as a ""B1G Alum"" which isn't strictly true: he played college basketball at a current B1G school, so I'm counting it, but he technically came and went prior to Maryland's move to the B1G (Len was a freshman in Maryland's third-to-last ACC year, and went to the NBA following his sophomore season)."
"His average over the last 3 years would probably be 1 assist higher if he wasn't passing to the all-NBA center rotation of Alex Len, Bruno Fernando, and Dewayne Dedmon"
"Lukas supporting cast beat the 1 seed bucks with Giannis last year.  Trae had 41 year old vince Carter playing 15 minutes per game. His centers were Damian Jones, Alex Len and dewayne dedmon.   But Luka was heralded and Trae was called an empty stats player.  (Not saying luka is an empty stats player just saying the goalposts seem to shift an awful lot.)  Trae‚Äôs shooting splits don‚Äôt tell the whole story because he still got his team involved with his passing and kept an all nba defender attached to him at all times."
"I thought about it, but wanted to keep the table in the OP a little cleaner. That said, here's that data:  &amp;#x200B;  |(1) Kevin Huerter|Maryland|139 pts (12 games)| |:-|:-|:-| |(2) Tim Hardaway Jr.|Michigan |119 pts (7 games)| |(T3) Bryn Forbes|Michigan State|92 pts (11 games)| |(T3) Mike Conley|Ohio State|92 pts (6 games)| |(5) Jaren Jackson Jr.|Michigan State|68 pts (5 games)| |(T6) Kendrick Nunn|Illinois|41 pts (4 games)| |(T6) Duncan Robinson|Michigan|41 pts (4 games)| |(8) Romeo Langford|Indiana|36 pts (4 games)| |(9) Alex Len|Maryland|20 pts (5 games)| |(10) E'Twaun Moore|Purdue|11 pts (3 games)| |(11) Frank Kaminsky|Wisconsin|10 pts (6 games)| |(T12) Amir Coffey|Minnesota|5 pts (7 games)| |(T12) Carsen Edwards|Purdue|5 pts (2 games)| |(14) Daniel Oturu|Minnesota|4 pts (5 games)| |(15) Jalen Smith|Maryland|3 pts (3 games)| |(T16) Yogi Ferrell|Indiana|2 pts (6 games)| |(T16) Bruno Fernando|Maryland|2 pts (2 games)| |(T16) Cassius Winston|Michigan State|2 pts (1 game)| |(T16) Xavier Tillman Sr.|Michigan State|2 pts (3 games)| |(20) Trey Burke|Michigan |1 pt (2 games)|"
Bro you‚Äôre crazy. I didn‚Äôt see Jabari Parker or Alex Len put up Capela numbers.
"Yeah i didnt know how he was going to translate to the nba, and was pleasantly surprised when he was an assist monster. Maryland always putting out some decent players. Except for alex len. My god alex len lmao"
I‚Äôd say wait to see what your current set up can do first. They lost Thomas Bryant early and had Alex Len starting a lot of the year so that‚Äôs pretty terrible. And Deni missed some time. Get a healthy year of the triple double king and one of the best scorers in the NBA with some good help and see first before blowing it up.
We'll even throw in Alex Len! Absolute steal.
"I hate the empty stat narrative because he's always done his thing at or above the league average efficiency. He carved through defenses with, at most three or four other NBA caliber players at any given time. He handled double and triple teams when his starting five included such hits as: Tyler Ulis, Alex Len, and *the incomparable* Dragan Bender. He's handled his shit in the dark, dragging teams that would have won less than 10 games out of the historically bad, year after year.   You could see it all in his post game interview after the Denver series. He's been under-appreciated for far too long; even this season people are giving most of the credit to Paul, avoiding giving Booker his due. He's still shocking people with these games and he's not done."
Alex Len.
Here‚Äôs what Gobert can‚Äôt do: *writes 14 paragraphs*  Here‚Äôs what Gobert can do: shut down Bismack Biyombo and Alex Len üò§
He‚Äôs making Capela look like Alex Len. Bucks won‚Äôt put up much of a fight against him either
My nan can drop 30 against gafford and Alex Len
French Alex Len
Gobert is just a french Alex Len. Pretender trash
Dont disrespect Alex Len like that. He knows how to grab an offensive rebound
Hey leave Alex Len outta this
Lmao French Alex Len got me real good
"Give them to Draymond, Embiid, Giannis, I don't care. Anybody besides French Alex Len deserves them"
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs overhyped. He‚Äôs ~~Julius Randle~~ Alex Len with hops.‚Äù
"Word after 2 years of watching us trot out Jabari Parker, Alex len, Damian Jones 43 year old VC, DeAndre Bemrby, Bruno Fernando and a bunch of rookies I don't want to hear shit about bad supporting casts lol."
"He‚Äôs averaged more assists every year. Luka had a better team year 1 and 2 and Trae still averaged more assists. It‚Äôs crazy to me team talent suddenly matters for Luka fans. They never mentioned it at all when Trae had 2 rookies, Jabari Parker, and Alex Len as his supporting cast."
"After he had 18 assists in  Game 4, Bill said that the Trae of last year would never have done that. Like yeah no shit the lob game and the PnR game don't work as well when you've got Alex Len and Bembry instead of Clint, Trae didn't go up a level as a playmaker he just has guys like Clint, Gallo and Bogdanovic now who he can trust to actually do something with the passes he feeds them."
"I replied to another person with this but;   Trae Young‚Äôs team mates by minutes played with  1.	‚Å†Hunter - Rookie 2.	‚Å†Huerter - 21 years old in year 2. Younger than Hunter 3.	‚Å†Reddish - Rookie 4.	‚Å†Collins - 22 years old, year 3 5.	‚Å†Jabari Parker - 24 years old, guy that doesn‚Äôt play defence and barley has a role in the league 6.	‚Å†Damion Jones - 24 years old - 3rd string Center caliber player 7.	‚Å†DeAndre Bembry - 25 years old, almost no offence. 10th man on most playoff teams 8.	‚Å†Alex Len - 26 years old. Was cut from the Raptors despite their biggest hole being the 5 9.	‚Å†Vince Carter - quite literally the oldest player in the history of the NBA this season 10.	‚Å†Bruno Fernando - Rookie  Trae had probably the worst supporting cast in the league last year."
last year his third scoring option was Jabari Parker..until the trade lol and Atlanta had a 43 year old Vince Carter on the floor with Trae Young sometimes. DeAndre Hunter and Cam Reddish were rookies and weren't they running DeWayne Dedmon/Alex Len for center? it's almost like..you put a true superstar floor general with a real roster and suddenly things like this start happening. Last years Hawks didn't even play a minute of Clint Capela after the trade
"Trae Young‚Äôs team mates by minutes played with  1. Hunter - Rookie  2. Huerter - 21 years old in year 2. Younger than Hunter  3. Reddish - Rookie  4. Collins - 22 years old, year 3  5. Jabari Parker - 24 years old, guy that doesn‚Äôt play defence and barley has a role in the league  6. Damion Jones - 24 years old - 3rd string Center caliber player  7. DeAndre Bembry - 25 years old, almost no offence. 10th man on most playoff teams  8. Alex Len - 26 years old. Was cut from the Raptors despite their biggest hole being the 5  9. Vince Carter - quite literally the oldest player in the history of the NBA this season  10. Bruno Fernando - Rookie   It was literally him playing with a bunch of young/inexperienced players and almost no vets. The vets they did have were either guys fighting for roster spots that have been bouncing around teams, and 43 year old Vince Carter."
"I think younger players are starting to get tired of being really good and then being underrated or straight disrespected for not making the playoffs or winning a series. Your team is a prime example of this, Devin Booker getting snubbed constantly because he couldn't drag  Alex Len and Isaiah Canaan to the playoffs."
"\*Toronto Raptors fan weighs in\*   Actually, finding a competent big man is NOT that easy, it turns out. \*gestures wildly at Aron Baynes and Alex Len\*"
"Trae had Jabari Parker, Alex Len, and 2 rookies in 2020‚Ä¶"
Trae should have had one all nba for this year or last year If Lloyd pierce wasn‚Äôt sabatoging the team in the 4th or destroying players confidence. He put up 30 and 10 with Damian Jones and Alex Len catching his passes.
Alex Len. Kings overpaid him tho
"The '1' part is the hard part- easy to get 0-82! Need at least 1 or 2 dudes that can get crazy hot but will let you down most of the time. No good team players- want some jerks who are gonna get there own shot but not build chemistry, and then someone who screws you on defending corner 3s most games because he can't get out there in time:  JR Smith, Lou Williams, Nick Young, Gilbert Arenas, Alex Len"
My strategy would be to have a team of only lumbering centres. They will lose almost every game but there‚Äôs gonna be one night where a team doesn‚Äôt have the big bodies it needs and just gets beat up enough to lose.  PG: Mason Plumlee SG: Alex Len SF: Boogie PF: Robin Lopez C: DeAndre Jordan
Cody Zeller and Alex Len would be a great duo.  Charlotte Hornets wet dream
"It already feels like they have that rep. Guys like RHJ, Stanley Johnson, Alex Len, DeAndre Bembry all signed here to try and turn their careers around.  Even during the Draft interview process, you had Mobley, Suggs and Barnes all speaking highly about the ""Raptors development system""."
"Trae averaged 8.2 APG his rookie year with a big rotation of Dewayne Dedmond, Alex Len, 2nd year John Collins, and Omari Spellman. Averaged 9.3 APG his second year with a big rotation of Bruno Fernando, John Collins, Jabari Parker, Damien Jones, and Alex Len. He's a better passer than Luka. Luka is still a better overall player, but passing in particular Trae is better."
"What player could‚Äôve taken a squad of Alex Len, Jabari parker, and two rookies to the playoffs?"
"Trae could also create these looks for KP, Powell and Kleber.  He did for Alex Len and Damian Jones, they just couldn't finish them."
i mean he had similar assist numbers when he had alex len and damian jones playing center.
"Because Toronto is not trying to compete. Center depth was a need just so it‚Äôs not a complete disaster but the Raps would rather go young hence also getting Precious from the Heat.   They already acquired a serviceable vet at center in Khem Birch at the deadline last year who played well and brought him back. So they already have a vet that can be a low end starter.  If Dwight Powell is included in the trade, there‚Äôs another quality vet big that can eat minutes.  And then they‚Äôll have Precious who will have an opportunity to compete for minutes and develop as well as Brown.   And Boucher will be situational and matchup dependent as I‚Äôm sure Precious and Dwight would be.   The Raptors problem was their big rotation to start last year was Baynes and Alex Len who both sucked. Bringing in Khem Birch who was serviceable and played well basically solved their problem. Now they can have him start and play 25 minutes a night and have young guys develop behind him"
"No point making comments like that when you don't watch the team.    The team lacked depth last year. We were starting players like Raul Neto (at SF) and Alex Len in the playoffs ... we actually had 0 playable SFs after Avdija got injured.    Didn't acquire stars, but got much needed quality depth  - Not a fan of Dinwiddie ... but he led a much worse Nets roster to the playoffs.  - KCP/Kuzma still played important roles on the Lakers championship team ... they're solid role players  - Harrell is 1 year away from winning 6th man of the year ... he was part of the Clippers team that made the playoffs with no stars."
"Trae‚Äôs had better assist stats since they got drafted. Even when he was playing with Jabari Parker, Damian Jones, Alex Len and Kent Bazemore."
"I think they should put in Alex Len, I think Alex Len could really help them in the interior, protecting the basket."
Last year? As in the roster with Alex Len and Bembry? Yeah this is why I don't take r/nba seriously
"That's true, and some people do that better than others. Capela's probably the premier example of that and he makes like 15M a year.  You can get a guy like Hassan Whiteside or Alex Len on a bargain-bin contract that can do the same things, but they're only going to be good for soaking up regular season minutes because they'll be exploited in the playoffs.   If you want a center that won't be trash in the playoffs, you'll have to pay more than bottom-of-the-barrel."
I hate that Suns management so much. They were one good center away from being a solid playoff team (they had Alex Len and one of the Lopez brothers) and they decided to go after Isaiah Thomas. WHEN THEY ALREADY HAD 2 POINT GUARDS
alex len is a big man
"Alex Len, Trae Young, and Vince Carter were all picked fifth"
"Trae sped the rebuild up. Should‚Äôve been even faster, his second year was wasted by trying to throw oops to Alex Len and picking n popping with 43 year old Vince carter"
*Alex Len and Damian Jones has left the chat*
And the most underrated poster dunk is Ryan Anderson on Alex Len. Shits nasty.
"I don‚Äôt really think the Kings need a centre  They got Holmes back, signed Alex Len, traded T. Thompson.  They got plenty of Centre.  (Unless Cousins can play SF, lol)"
"Pretty shocking, some mock drafts had Alex Len at 1"
"Plus right now our centers are Holmes, TT now, and Alex Len with Quentas (2nd round draft pick) projected to be more of a project."
I know Alex Len also has the same agent.
I think Alex Len had the longest playoff drought but that ended this past playoffs.
How did Bum get a max with hands like Alex Len?
If we only have started Alex Len and Baynes we could have got the 2nd pick.
"We'll see, and I'm open to being wrong. But Kings fans thought the exact same thing last offseason - just need a big body on a one-year deal to eat some minutes against opposing bigs. Whiteside was miles worse than that. He was a fucking saboteur who actually made the team worse every time he stepped on the court. The only reason he got any minutes at all was because the Kings didn't have another 7 footer on the roster until the trade deadline, when Whiteside was immediately benched for fucking Damian Jones.  I really think Jazz would have been better off with any other cheap vet at that position: Alex Len, Robin Lopez, Gorgui Dieng, whoever. But I guess it might not matter, because there's zero chance he plays a single second in the playoffs."
We also aren‚Äôt playing Terence Davis or Alex Len  Bench is going to be in a way better spot

alex len
Bum might have worse hands than Alex Len.
Besides Tony Snell and Alex Len? Nique
"How are they trending the right way? They literally have the same team, that can‚Äôt even make it to the playoffs? In fact not even close to the playoffs. I don‚Äôt even want to sound like a hater, but one rookie and Alex Len aren‚Äôt exactly a big additions to the team"
We just picked up Alex Len too. Market is growing thin
Who is at better value ?  Gorgu or Alex Len ?
As soon as we drafted Alex Len we needed a center
As soon as they lost Alex Len they needed a backup center
It's only fitting that the Kangs re-signed Alex Len lol
"This should be a lesson for the people who said ‚Äúlet your big man walk and pay some dude whatever‚Äù at the Jarret Allen news. If Sac FO really think Alex Len can replace Holmes production, they gonna have another long ass season."
Alex Len really out here still getting cheques? Gotta respect the ability to finesse these teams with his height.
Well from my POV:  -	Didn‚Äôt fire Luke Walton despite one of the deepest coaching pools in recent memory -	Failed to trade Buddy for decent assets (so far) but missed a good opportunity  -	Failed to trade Bagley (so far) -	Drafted a 23 year old PG that‚Äôs 6‚Äô0 tall with the 9th pick when our 2 best players can‚Äôt play the 3 position.  -	Signed Mo Harkless and Alex Len
"I really do think the kings have a 2021 knicks level season coming soon, so I guess Alex Len is gonna be the next cam Payne huh?"
Is Alex Len working for free? exposure maybe
Alex Len lol
Kings dumb af. Neemias Queta &gt; Alex Len and Tristan Thompson
&gt; Alex Len     &gt; SAC     I'm sorry Kings fans
Alex Len getting a multi year contract this offseason is the comeback story of the century
‚ÄúFree agent Alex‚Äù oh fuck fuck  ‚ÄúLen‚Äù  oh ok.
Alex Len wizards legend
I‚Äôm thinking of putting Alex Len more on the joker
Raptors legend alex len
"Yeah like Westbrook put up nearly 12 apg last year feeding Daniel Gafford, Robin Lopez, and Alex Len. People saying he won‚Äôt help or even will hurt one of the best big men in the league are lunatics"
"Pretty sure when I caught wizard games where the wizards played Russ with Ish smith, Chandler Hutchinson, Rui, and Alex Len on the floor if thats not the worst spacing you've seen you shouldnt complain about the type of spacing the lakers will have this season."
*Alex Len has entered the chat*
A guy who really overdoes it is Alex Len bias
his ceiling is Alex Len without the touch.
"Idk, he hasn't lived up to being #4 but this thing is a crap shoot. 2013 was Anthony Bennett/Victor Oladipo/Otto Porter/Cody Zeller. 2014 was Andrew Wiggins/Jabari Parker/Joel Embiid/Aaron Gordon. Alex Len and Dante Exum were the #5s those years. You obviously hope to get a franchise-altering guy in the top 10 (especially top 4), but really you're praying to avoid a bust. An above average role player historically isn't bad for a Top-10 pick."
He's Alex Len without the upside.
"Damn, him and Alex Len didn't have good PnR numbers? I'm shocked"
He‚Äôd also average way more assists if he wasn‚Äôt passing to alex Len on pick and rolls
it is when the other starters Alex Len and Garrison Matthews  Daniel Gafford barely got burn w the Bulls and then was one of the best players for Washington   Wizards are ass man
"The Suns are pretty bad outside of Booker.  Josh Jackson, Alex Len, Dragan Bender, etc  Could've taken Luka over Ayton too."
"I mean, it is the one thing that really changed roster-wise between the 2019-20 Toronto Raptors who went 53-19 and the 2020-21 Toronto Raptors who went 27-45. The two biggest pieces we lost in between those two seasons was, coincidently, our two centres in Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol. We also lost Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, O'Shae Brissett, Dewan Hernandez and Malcolm Miller but they were marginal bench pieces who we replaced with DeAndre Bembre, Malachi Flynn &amp; Yuta Watanbe as well as increased role for Northman Powell + Gary Trent Junya. Roster-wise, the only difference of consequence is going from two centres who were both able to start for us and going to two unplayable centres in Aron Baynes who is just washed af and Alex Len. So yeah, if we had playable centres, I think that would be the solution to what is the only roster we have.  Obligatory Fuck Tampa Bay as well."
1. Nerlens Noel  2. Victor Oladipo  3. Otto Porter  4. Ben Mclemore  5. Alex Len  It was a shit class in general lol
Kevin huerter did well in the playoffs and alex len is on the wizards. A bunch if other young players not getting much playing time but hopefully they do well
"I think the Deni Avdija, Alex Len, Rui Hachimura frontcourt from the wizards was comparable"
"&gt;Swapping Simmons for Westbrook is probably a lateral move.   I used to think that but the more I delve into it, the fit becomes apparent.  Wizards' rotation of bigs (Robin Lopez, Gafford, and Alex Len) together were collectively the best in the league, outright dropping buckets at high efficiency. Russ really could get Embiid the ball and give him more space to operate than Simmons could. He was averaging close to 15 assists for the 2nd half of the year.  Russ is also from a cultural standpoint a great locker room and community presence - the opposite of Simmons, who likes to disappear and act aloof unless someone asked him if he should be RoY/DPOY. Russ goes hard in practice and would mesh well with Embiid who is self-accountable.   Simmons acting aloof and using his status as franchise player to avoid listening to coach Brown (who was begging him to shoot a bit more) really, really, rubbed me the wrong way."
"Lets put it this way if they play the sixers again fully healthy (and embiid doesnt miss those games) the sixers sweep the wizards. Thomas Bryant is a terrible defender, and russ and beal playing healthy wouldnt make a difference besides one maybe just maybe 2 games thats being generous. Sure playing alex len hurts but none of there centers can check him and they have no defensive philosophy either.   Against the hawks they are not nearly capable of checking them in a 7 game series, trae pick and rolls will destroy them so thats 4 teams right there. They are not being a defensive team like the knicks who will only get better and not to mention the heat and celtics werent fully healthy (no brown for celtics) theyre both better teams especially the celtics when healthy who they played in the playin and let tatum score 50. There team isnt good at all they have 2 stars, 2 good role players but the rest arent cut out to be on a playoff team."
"Assuming everyone is healthy, against the Bucks/ Nets, Wiz go home 1st round. Against everyone else, (depending on what Sixers do), they can compete. Lots of games were lost with too much Alex Len, too much Russ-Ish-Neto lineups, Thomas Bryant injury, Russ and Beal playing hurt, COVID."
Jaylen took a step slightly back defensively with his offensive involvement increase.  They were pretty much even in steals/blocks/ defensive rating and defensive win shares. I have a hard time comparing Dbpm when brown has timelord covering for him vs Alex Len (need more gafford).  Browns defense is overrated imo. Especially as his offensive role has increased.    Brown better than the (almost) league scoring champ?   You realize that brown commits as many turnovers as Beal handling the ball way less and doesn‚Äôt create nearly as many assists despite playing on a better team.   Who says that Brown with even more usage and more fga can sustain the same efficiency?   Brown also hasn‚Äôt proven consistently to score like this as Beal has. Beal just had back to back 30+ ppg seasons
"The Hawks ""process"" was to introduce veteran talent 2/3 years into most guys rookie deals because that's the most financially viable option.   The team was ass, but that's more because of the veteran's we replaced with actual NBA quality players rather than our young talent underperforming across the board.   Yeah, Hunter/Huerter both took a major step this year, but they were always the plan.   Replacing Alex Len with Clint Capela makes any team better."
"Anthony Bennet, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller, Alex Len, Nerlins Noel, Ben McLemore for Luka. You still game? You would need the top 27 picks of the 13 draft to have a playoff team."
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
"gasol looked washed but russ can make him look pretty good for the reg season at least and then in playoffs just play ad at the 5 and even if drummond leaves russ would make whoever they sign, trezz/alex len or lopez or sum look like really good as long as they catch the ball"
Book lost his composure. That game 6 against the clippers he was locked in and tonight not so much. Its ok. He's only 24 and he'll keep getting better. First playoffs for him and the young suns and they showed out!! I'm proud of them but we got outplayed by Giannis. We should of drafted him. Where the hell is Alex len???
"Giannis went 15th and Gobert 27th in 2013. The top 5 picks that year were Anthony Bennet, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller and Alex Len. The FO is doing proper due diligence."
I'm sure it would be a massive benefit to Alex Len if he carried his team to a championship and won FMVP lol
Most draft mocks the month leading into the draft had Alex Len going 1st overall so the pick was fucked regardless.
"People overrate how big of a reach he was.  The top like 6-8 players were all viewed as interchangeable more or less.  The closest thing to consensus 1 was Nerlens and he even fell to #6.  Dipo was viewed as a ‚Äúsafe-ish‚Äù top 3 pick with higher floor and low ceiling.   On paper his upside is intriguing.  Elite rebounder who can stretch the floor.  Bennett, Oladipo, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller, Alex Len, Nerlens Noel, Ben McLemore was your top 7  Basically everyone high lottery was fucked in some way"
"It's easy to be a draft savant when you have hindsight on your side.  I am looking at the drafts now in fact. Look at the top 5's:  2013: Bennett, Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr, Cody Zeller, Alex Len   2014: Wiggins, Jabari, Embiid, Gordon, Dante Exum   2 out of 10 players ended up being great. If anything it makes the Cavs look better for trading while the guys still had high value.  The guys still available when they drafted Waiters were Thomas Robinson, Lillard, Harrison Barnes, Terrence Ross, Andre Drummond, Austin Rivers, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lamb, Kendall Marshall, John Henson, etc. So in all these scenarios there's one really great player that they missed (and 4-5 other teams passed on as well). If they took Giannis #1 in 2013 the GM would've been fired on the spot.   The Bennett pick is bad and one of the worst of all-time. But even that the likely alternative would've still been considered one of the biggest busts ever (unless they took Oladipo). I remember the hype leading up to the draft Alex Len was the most common projected #1. The other picks range from average to pretty good. They took TT over Jan Vesely, Biyombo, Knight, etc. Kyrie over Derrick Williams."
Not random at all. Alex Len is a poster machine. Everybody bodies that dude.
"It was a horrible draft pick obviously but that draft was notoriously bad. There was no clear number 1, if I recall before the draft most had Nerlens Noel going 1st but he tore his acl so his stock dropped. People like Otto Porter Jr, Alex Len and Cody Zeller were in the top 5.   To me, what‚Äôs worse is when you have a strong draft and you passed on an obvious option to take a guy you thought had more potential, like Bagley or Flynn"
‚ÄòFacial on Alex Len‚Äô lmaoo
‚ÄúAnderson gets to the rim‚Ä¶And a facial on Alex Len!‚Äù
"Russ played with Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford last year. All three of those guys benefited from Russ's play. The idea that he Russ doesn't gel with big men is very wrong. His interior passing and rim running passes are how he gets a ton of assists."
"Noel, the supposed favorite to go 1st, dropped out of the top 5 altogether (so it's not like only CLE skipped on him). Burke, McCollum, McLemore, Carter-Williams, and Muhammad were all picked later than they were supposed to according to those mock drafts. There were even players picked outside of the lottery like Schroeder and Mason Plumlee that were apparently likely to be picked earlier. And to a smaller extent Oladipo's just good enough for 4th at best, and not as the 2nd overall. The only thing that was somewhat correct in the mocks among the top picks were Otto Porter and Alex Len.  But somehow Bennett dropping to 19th (if we're starting from the ""top 10, maybe top 5"" starting point) is ""bullshit"". In the same draft that had its ""consensus 1st"" leave the top 5. lol"
"Booker didn‚Äôt play this game so HOLY SHIT the guys on the floor for the Suns:  Dragan Bender 38 Minutes 15 points (now out of the league)  Daniel House Jr 40 minutes 16 points (hanging on with Houston)  Alex Len 27 minutes 18 points (barely hanging on in the league)  Shaq Harrison 36 minutes 18 points (just finished a 2 way contract with the nuggets basically out of the league)  Jared Dudley 32 minutes 5 points, 250 lbs (now out of the league)  Tyler Ulis 28 minutes 14 points (now out of the league)  Alec Peters the GOD 28 minutes 36 points (now out of the league)  The shit Booker had to play with in those days was just putrid."
"Rubio's not bad, I can understand drafting someone who balled out against team USA as a teenager. Even now he's about what you usually expect from a 5th pick.   For reference, other 5th picks from 2005-2015: Hezonja, Exum, Alex Len, Thomas Robinson, Valanciunas, Cousins, Love, Jeff Green, Shelden Williams, and Raymond Felton.  Flynn was a mistake though."
I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôm just an average nba player in this situation About 540 players got minutes at some point last year so I‚Äôm figuring I‚Äôm like guy 270 so like maybe like Alex Len/Brad Wannamaker  And so I‚Äôm signing anywhere I can get minutes so I can hopefully drag out this career as long as possible
"Kings: starting Buddy &amp; Bagley to keep their trade value up.   Starters: Fox, Buddy, Barns, Bagley, Holmes.   Bench: Davion, Haliburton, Terrance Davis, MO Harkless, Tristan Thompson/Alex Len.   Closing: Fox, Haliburton, Davion, Barns, Holmes.  (Maybe Buddy for Davion)."
And since Gasol is always out/always hurt?  Now the Lakers have a guy who can come in and run a little bit with Russ in a way like Alex Len or Steven Adams used to do.
"Does Bryant shoot? I thought he was a more of a capella-lite with a better post game. Cuz that‚Äôs why embiid was always shooting 3s. You can‚Äôt have two non-shooting players on the floor in today‚Äôs nba. Ben also prob isn‚Äôt gonna play at center which is really his best position.  I think the sixers role players are head and shoulders above anything the wiz have: Danny green, Seth curry, shake Milton, thybulle. They also had George hill last year and Dwight Howard.  The wiz had: Raul Neto, Deni advija, Bertans, rui, robin lopez, Alex Len? Ish smith?  You could conceivably win games with the 76ers deep bench. You‚Äôre not gonna get that with the wiz. Simmons on the wiz needs like a clarkson or two to be a functional team."
"Probably from 2015 or maybe 2016 until 2020.  The 2011-2013 years were pretty damn bad but 2016-2019 was an all time low outside of Booker, legitimately our only highlight of 3+ years was an 18 year old find his rhythm. From Sarver, to Mcdonough to the players he drafted. The alex len years, the josh jackson years, the dragan bender years...   2019 we got bridges+ayton and Igor who wasn't the best coach but he was definitely a step up and a step in the right direction from the revolving door of coaches we had before."
Ahhhh Raptors legend Alex Len and Racist Myers Leonard.
Shaq‚Äôs look when he kept saying Alex Len is perfect. Lol. Dude took up all his time and got it wrong at that.
"May have been true in 2019 when his squad consisted of Alex Len, Jabari Parker, and 2 rookies. He shot considerably less 3‚Äôs per game last season when he wasn‚Äôt Atlanta‚Äôs only offensive threat."
"Wasn‚Äôt saying that his point was incorrect, just that Atlanta was a poor example of why. The impact Capela has made on our defense was immeasurable. He didn‚Äôt play a game for us after we traded for him in 19/20, and our defense was awful that year with scrubs at C. Last year he led the league in rebounding (which I lump in with defensive impact) and was light years ahead of the impact we got from Alex Len in 19/20."
"Honestly - you saw him at the bottom 19/20 because that year he had Jabari Parker, Vince Carter and Alex Len behind him.  Now with Hunter, JC and Capela hes a lot closer to league average than most people think"
"Westbrook was the reason we made the playoffs, but he also did play us out of games.  People also underestimate depth ... last year were starting players like Mo Wagner, Alex Len, Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga, and Jerome Robinson...       Trading Beal would have been the better option imo... because I don't think you have much room to make the roster better once Beal is making close to 50M a year..."
I was telling everyone who would listen that Alex Len would be a star because he cooked Noel on college. Turns out I know less then nothing
Man took until game 4 of the playoffs to realize Alex Len should not touch an nba court outside of garbage time
"Trae was averaging 9,3 assists the year before with John Collins suspended for 25 games at the start of the season with Alex Len, Damian Jones and Bruno Fernando as his bigs.  Basically the type of bigs he has is irrelevant to how good of a passer he is"
* Dante Exum * Nik Stauskas * Solomon Hill * Aleksej Pokusevski * Alex Len
"I agree with every word. This Wizard team will definitely be slept on throughout the season, and it looks like Beal and Spence are good friends that could form a strong back court. Also, SCOTT BROOKS IS GONE I forgot about him being out which some of those line ups he put out there in meaningful games wanted me to turn off the tv. Alex Len got way too many minutes and him being off the squad will make a huge difference (he blew at least 4 games for you last year)"
"Atlanta is a poor example here. Capela did elevate us from last year and the year before when we had the likes of jabari Parker and Alex Len playing in the middle, but to say that our wing defense was soft is not that accurate. Deandre Hunter, until he got hurt against Philly, was shaping up to be one of the premier wing defenders in the league. He‚Äôs a guy you can put on the other team‚Äôs best player and forget about it. Same with cam reddish, except he was out the second half of the year and only played ECF last few games. Bogi and K‚Äôvon both solid team wing defenders. The biggest weak spots on the hawks D are Trae Young against the opposing ball handler, and John Collins against bigger PF and Cs."
"Ya. Crazy Trae didn‚Äôt carry a team of jabari Parker, Alex Len, and 2 rookies to the playoffs. lol what a take.  To be fair, Tatum had brown and Kemba and he carried the Celtics to the bubble lulz"
"Falcon and the Winter Solider ""Alex Len"" he only guy that look like Buckey."
Alex Len jumper was wet lolll
"I mean I think we a have a legit 7-8 man rotation. By legit I mean everyone in it has a serviceable NBA skill. Just going by guards we have Halliburton, Fox, Hield, and Davion. We‚Äôre admittedly thin on the wing and terrence davis is not helping at all so far, but Harkless has been solid and Barnes is playing out of his mind. Inside Holmes has been great but gets in foul trouble, so Alex Len has been great for us so far. But yeah we are a Harrison Barnes or Holmes injury away from being in big trouble."
"Fair enough but still, fox can‚Äôt a 3 for his life. Even Alex Len was hitting them 3s lol"
"Time for our yearly, ""What is Alex Len doing right now?"""
"I've got one. On draft day of the 2016 NBA draft:  Phoenix receives Sacramento's 2016 first round pick (#8)  Sacramento receives two 2016 firsts (#13 and #28), a 2020 2nd round pick, and the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic.  It's not lopsided by any means. I think it would have been a wash if Bogdanovic never came to the league. However, the picks ended up just being a whole lot of bleh.  That 8th pick was Marquese Chriss, who has flashed potential on the Warriors fairly recently, but got pretty badly injured and hasn't played in a while.  That 13th pick was Georgios Papagiannis. We know how that one ended up.  The 28th pick was Skal Labissiere, who was almost projected for the lottery, but kept falling, and apparently for good reason. He's not on a team anymore.  The 2020 second round pick was eventually traded to Memphis on draft day 2020, and became Xavier Tillman (traded for Robert Woodard and a 2022 second rounder). Tillman's a solid rotation player.  -------------  Out of anything, the pick of Georgios Papagiannis is the biggest headscratcher out of this whole trade. Obviously, this isn't at the magnitude of picking Bagley over Luka, and that 2016 draft was kind of crap in the late lottery and mid first round. Honestly this was just a lose-lose for everyone. Both teams had been gunning to find their next solid big man. In recent history, the Suns used major draft capital to select Alex Len (2013), Dragan Bender (2016), Marquese Chriss (2016), and finally Deandre Ayton (2018), while the Kings had picked Thomas Robinson (2012), Willie Cauley-Stein (2015), Papagiannis (2016), and most recently, Marvin Bagley (2019). House SunKings indeed."
You have no idea how much I suck though.  I'm basically Alex Len in a unathletic Trae Youngs body
Westbrook made Gafford look like an All Star after Coach Brooks had them stuck in Alex Len prison for half the season.
"Man, Alex Len played for Phoenix for years, and I *wish* I could forget his name."
"Sorry Jazz fans, I guess we're rivals now. Alex Len is going to kill you, and Joe Ingles will be sent to prison, where he belongs"
"Lol bro Wizards are just a deep team man with Spencer Dinwiddie, Kuzma, Harrell, etc.  Westbrook was starting with Raul Neto at SF and Alex Len at Center.   Gafford was an extremely late acquisition that didn't even start.  I'd say the Wiz now have a real team with depth where the starting 5 are pretty legit.   Wizards didn't need guys like John Wall and Westbrook taking up $45 million of salary. Spreading it across Kuzma, Harrell, Dinwiddie were the right moves."
"I believe Trae and the hawks also beat the #1 seed sixers, right? The sixers had 3 all nba defensive selections compared to the Clippers 1. Luka stans said roster talent didn‚Äôt matter when Trae‚Äôs squad was Alex Len, Jabari Parker, and 2 rookies. Weird how it‚Äôs the only thing that matters once Trae gets a comparable roster."
"That's our third center.  Two years ago our center rotation was Alex Len, Damian Jones and ""Vince, you played center in the 90s?"""
They have TT and Alex Len on the team‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd be surprised if he couldn‚Äôt beat them out lol. He just wants out
He couldn't beat out Tristan Thompson's n and Alex len
"I'm fairly certain the idea is that a 36 year old lebron cannot be your primary ballhandler and playmaker for what you hope to be 100+ games this year, regular season and playoffs.   Yeah, he is bionic or whatever, but even cybernetics have limitations.   So you bring in Russ, who just spend a year making Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford look like an above average center rotation, and have him be your playmaker for the regular season. Or at least large stretches of it. LeBron still going to take over late in any close games.   LeBron can rest a bit playing off ball more, AD should feast on the PnR with him, they have some decent shooting to spread around him.   They'll cruise to the playoffs, and then LeBron takes over once he is back in his natural habitat. And hopefully by then they'd have figured out how to make russ fit into the lebron offense.     What is concerning is that I didnt see like any of that yesterday, it was the LeBron/AD show all game long.  And if that's the plan this season, lebron still as like the primary ballhandler and playmaker when he is on the floor... I dont know how they are going to make it work."
"if you listen to McDonough every good pick was McDonough's idea and every bust was Sarver's idea. He's quick to point out that he drafted Booker and Ayton but is pretty quiet about Alex Len, Tyler Ennis, Dragan Bender, trading up with Bogdan Bogdanovic for Marquese Chriss, Tyler Ulis, Josh Jackson, and Elie Okobo. McD was even sniping the Mikal Bridges pick saying he wanted to get Sahi instead when bridges had his shooting hitch but now is suddenly all in on Mikal now that hes proven to be one of the best 2 way wings in the league. You cant trust anything this guy says about the suns  His tenure oversaw the absolute worst period of history for a franchise that had never been a bottom dweller but if you listen to the guy on twitter youd think hes a genius. Its pretty damning that the team was turned into a finals contender two years after he was fired with 80% roster turnover."
You're talking about not trading Bagley in the past which is fine. But DNPs aren't going to turn 2nd round offers into something better and Alex Len isn't getting the Kings into the playoffs.  Sucks but this is another case of Sacramento FO having no clue
"If that's true then the Kings should be moving Bagley while his value is highest now, not tanking it further. Unless they feel they are in win-now mode and those minutes going to Alex Len are going to get them over the hump..."
If he's getting outplayed by Alex Len he should be brought behind the barn.  Len is possibly the worst center in the league.
"I remember the few games Alex Len played for us in 2020, he looked like a more positive impact player than Bagley. Bagley‚Äôs mentality of everything having to revolve around him is so cancerous and won‚Äôt work on any team"
"Luke said they‚Äôre typically gonna run with an 8-9 man rotation, most likely:  PG: Fox, Davion  SG: Haliburton, Buddy   SF: Harrison Barnes, Terrence Davis  PF: Mo Harkless (with various players rotating in to the 4 like Barnes, Thompson, or whatever the matchup allows for)  C: Holmes, Thompson  Based on the preseason these were the guys that gelled really well and Harkless has really surprised us as a role player since the end of last season. I think more often you‚Äôll see lineups with Harkless and Barnes at the 4 because of the defensive versatility to guard perimeter players, which is likely why Bagley is out of the rotation. No room at Center either, Bagley isn‚Äôt strong enough on defense and Alex Len is our 3rd string C"
If he‚Äôs getting outplayed by Alex Len he should be out the league.
"Because the context is Marvin Bagley. In a vacuum sure, Jeff is not a wackadoo. But congratulations about not caring about or not wanting to talk about Marvin Bagley in a thread about Marvin Bagley from Marvin Bagley's agent.   How is it contradictory. The team tried all of last season to build up his value and he instead got hurt a bunch and was generally not good. This off-season he came into camp and got out played by Alex Len and Tristan Thompson so they decided just to shut it down because they understand sunk cost and aren't wasting their time anymore on him. A good trade never materialized and Marvin Bagley never really impressed anyone with his play."
You joke but the Kings added a lot of big men in the offseason and if he's getting outplayed by Tristan Thompson and Alex Len then he should be out of the rotation.
"i meaaan, to be fair... unless team is tanking, which by all accounts theyre not, at best he's 9th guy in the rotation. A bit surprising he's not expected to get minutes over some combination of Alex Len/Terrence Davis/Louis King, but if the 3 guard lineups that have been getting talked up are legitimately going to eat up a lot of minutes, easy to see how he's not in the initial rotation since he's not a viable small ball center."
"It's not Jeff's job to care if Bagley is bad and been outplayed by a mix of Tristan Thompson and Alex Len in training camp. It's not Jeff's job to be fair and realize he's on the bench for a reason. It's also not Jeff's job to care what kind of trade offers were on the table for Bagley and if they were worth it for the team or not. Jeff is doing his job, but that also doesn't mean the Kings necessarily are wrong either."
"He did look decent last season, before he got hurt, so we probably wanted his potential over a couple of 2nds or whatever that was offered (plus he made like 10m last season). But then he literally came into this preseason looking worse than Alex Len. At this point we can keep him as an injury backup, and let him fuck off next season. And if anyone offers anything for him, then we trade him. Us as a fanbase have been wanting to offload his ass for the longest time"
"You pick up the next years team option the year before, so we picked it up last year (like weeks into Monte's first days) expecting him to get better. He looked decent, and he got hurt again, so he didn't play for a long time again. Then after this offseason, when you expect your young players to develop, he looked like a complete shitter in our preseason games. He looked worse than Alex Fucking Len. Who the fuck is going to trade anything worth anything for a Marvin fucking Bagley that is making 11m. The fuck"
"He should play better and outplay Alex Len and maybe he‚Äôd get some playing time. He obviously hasn‚Äôt earned it and they aren‚Äôt going to force giving him time just because he was a #2 pick. They have a chance at the play in, it‚Äôs an indictment on Bagley he isn‚Äôt playing."
Wizards are free from Alex Len prison and Prison guard Scott Brooks
"It‚Äôs not that I think he‚Äôs gonna play super amazing, as much as he almost can‚Äôt be worse than Willie Caullie-Stein or guys like Alex Len, who we‚Äôve been stuck with since Cousins left.    We got the starter position locked in with Richaun for now, but at least when he needs rest we won‚Äôt get bodied as hard now. Plus he‚Äôs had a bunch of clips posted behind the scenes, pumping up the guys or just being a solid teammate. It‚Äôs not all about his on court production haha."
"I don't know why there is a prevailing myth of you can just sign any bargain bin free agent center for less than 10 mil and be fine defensively. People point to Golden State but Draymond is their true crunch time center, what do you think they'll be if you replace Draymond with Willie Cauley-Stein or Alex Len?   Almost every playoff series we see a big man who's getting played off the floor because either he's too slow or too small, now finally you got a guy like Ayton who's got size and elite movement skills on defense, and his team is nickle and diming him like they can just easily replace him with the WCS or Tristan Thompsons of the world."
"I know it was hard to watch lol. Russ needs shooters to be a great player and we gave him Robin Lopez, Alex Len, and Ish Smith, often on the floor the same time"
"I can‚Äôt say about the actual stats, but he was running with Robin Lopez and Alex Len as his big men, with two of Neto, ish Smith, and Beal. It‚Äôs expected that they wouldn‚Äôt push the pace that well. Irregardless his rebounds easily helped the team get easy baskets. You could always count on Rui getting an easy 2 points every game just off of leaking out and catching a near full court pass from Westbrook."
I finally saw Sacramento last night.    They added Tristan and Alex Len.     9th pick and 39th pick.     Will that be enough to get them to the play-in?
I still think Alex Len had worse hands. Even Kyle couldn't save him.
"Top 5? He was consensus top 10 at most.  But truth be told, outside of Oladipo and Nerlens pre injury, there was no consensus for the top 10. They were being mock drafted all over the place.  Like before the draft happened, blog bois were saying Cleveland would pick Alex Len lmao.  My point is more that, Giannis had incredible upside and no one looked like an obvious pick. So if you were going to take a chance on Bennett, why not go for a guy with even more upside but just less guaranteed success? It was a shitty draft, so there was no point picking one of the ""guaranteed"" guys because all you were getting was a role player at their best.  I felt like this for the entire top 15 outside of Dipo. I still don't get why some guys got picked over Giannis, they looked more raw and had way less upside. McLemore, Trey Burke, Adams all looked worse than Giannis did at the draft.  &gt;Even from a purely athletics standpoint there was quite literally no reason to pick Giannis over Bennett.  Someone hasn't watched pre NBA Giannis. Anthony Bennett is one of the least spectacular prospects athletically that I've seen. Giannis is one of the most, his athleticism even without Basketball skills would make him a fringe NBA player/high end D league player."
"If mitch and book swapped, and book was on utah all these years instead of with the bottom of the barrel players in phoenix he would have made the playoffs more too. You guys had multi DPOY in rudy. Phoenix had alex len, chriss, broken down tyson chander, aaron baynes. And I‚Äôm only naming the big men.  So using playoff appearances isn‚Äôt fair way to compare."
"Gafford is more of a PF playing up size. Their franchise cornerstone centre, Thomas Bryant, tore his ACL at the start of last season.  They were playing Alex Len and Robin Lopez as their centres... I mean I had no doubt Russ was gonna take them to the playoffs. But... holy sht I had my doubts for a while xD"
"I‚Äôm only using the same metric Luka stans used the year prior. When Trae was surrounded by 2 rookies, Alex Len, and Jabari Parker winning basketball was the only thing that mattered and they propped up Luka‚Äôs playoff appearance. Trae then gets a comparable supporting cast and goes to the ECF and now all of a sudden it‚Äôs all about team talent."
"Ed Davis is unsigned, Alex Len is pretty bad but he‚Äôs at least playable, and Drummond was way overpaid but he‚Äôs at least decent on a near-minimum contract. Meyers Leonard was riding the bench and on the way out before creating controversy. If you‚Äôre an end of the bench guy, you gotta do everything right off the court or you‚Äôre not worth keeping around"
"Nah he got canceled. If guys  like Drummond or Alex Len, Ed Davis, etc can have a roster spot then so can Myers."
"It‚Äôs hilarious how much Luka stans have flip flopped. Weird how team talent meant nothing when Trae had Alex Len, 2 rookies, and Jabari Parker to meaning everything as soon as trae took a comparable squad to the conference finals."
There was a different play where davion absolutely smothered him with help from alex len and PG just pivots and hits a ridiculous fadeaway
alex len lol
"That take is fucking ridiculous.  Please look at our team two years ago.  Outside of guys on rookie contracts we had 42 year old Vince getting 20mpg, Alex Len and Damian Jones playing basically all center minutes and DeAndre Bembry getting starter minutes.  It was legit painful to watch that team outside of Trae and JC (who was banned for 25 games)"
"Hi I‚Äôve been drinking a lot of purple kool-aid these past few weeks  The Kings are gonna make a big jump. I‚Äôm not even exaggerating when I say they can even get up to 6th seed, but that‚Äôs assuming a lot goes wrong for other teams, like the blazers, clippers, warriors, and Mavs‚Äî and of course all the other potential play-in teams like minny, nola, and San Antonio  Of course I‚Äôm expecting us somewhere around 9-10. BUT kings have a few things working for us  Fox is a beast, and if he improves even more, like he has pretty much every season, he‚Äôs at an all star level. Tyrese Haliburton kicks ass and is going to be solid no matter what. Harrison Barnes is underrated af and at least league average. Richaun Holmes has like 95% accurate hook shot and can play great defense, and is a great roller on offense.   Our bench is the deepest it‚Äôs been in like 10 years. Yeah, it‚Äôs not the best, but now with guys like Buddy off the bench, Bagley if he makes a double jump- in terms of defense and health (he can be a walking 18/8), Alex Len to give us some size, Terence Davis for extra shooting and some defense, Harkless and TT for the vet presence, and potential up-and-comers like Chimezie Metu (ask Spurs fans) and our boy Davion MITCHELL to round it out  Obviously last year we had one of the statistically worst defenses ever, but we saw it get better to the end of the season. We got a couple new defensively minded assistant coaches in Doug Christie and Longabardi, we got some grittier players in our rookie Davion Mitchell AKA Off-Night, Terence Davis, Mo Harkless, Alex Len, and hopefully we embrace the chip on our shoulder of not being in the playoffs for so long  So, yeah I could go on and on about why I think we‚Äôll be better. Even with Luke Walton, even with our shitty defense last season, even with our lack of traditional forwards. The kings are making a jump this year, into the play-in at least and hopefully right into the playoffs  I know the Kings are the joke of the league and have been for a long time but it ends this season. From Sacramento we‚Äôre gonna see a jump like the Knicks, hawks, and Suns had last year.   When all the media and you motherfuckers look back at the end of the season and go ‚Äúwow we had no idea they were gonna be so good‚Äù I want you to look back at posts like these cause goddamn it some of us knew it was coming"
For players still in the league that get signifcant minutes who is the:  * *Best player purely by size/physique*  * *Best player purely by skill/that can't rely on physique*  * *Worst player purely by size/physique*  * *Worst player purely by skill/that can't rely on physique*  IMO I think it's  Rudy Gobert  Steph Curry  Bismack Biyombo or Alex Len  Anfernee Simons
"Lemme throw in my experiences seeing NBA players up close:  Basically anyone around the 7 ft range (I've seen Drew Eubanks, David Robinson, Alex Len and Dexter Pittman up close), I still cannot comprehend how someone can be that tall, let alone *extremely athletic*  PJ Tucker, Eric Bledsoe and Justin Anderson look like powerlifters more than hoopers, those dudes are chiseled   Trae Young looks exactly how you expect.  Bryn Forbes is insanely short for a NBA player  Rudy Gay is the only person I've seen where their wingspan blew me away, I never saw him as long on TV but apparently he was a 7'3"" wingspan."
"my god this subreddit is filled with 12 year olds. you could not make it more clear that you literally did not watch a single wizards game last year  my guy, westbrook dragged a team that started Alex fucking Len at Center to the playoffs. i swear you're fucking braindead"
dragged the wizards who voluntarily started Alex Len at C to the playoffs wtf are you talking about?  this subreddit is filled with 12 year olds isn't it
"People already went by that logic when Trae was playing with guys like Alex Len, Damian Jones, Kent Bazemore, Jabari Parker etc.   I think Luka will be fine though."
"Assuming a 1+1 and wild mass guessing:   2019-20    \- Danny would be the big question mark on whether he would have been offered a contract to re-sign or would sign based on the amount.   \- The summer we probably wouldn't have signed picked up half the players we did end up with (even bigger what if is this was Cam Payne's last chance before his exile to China)    \- To choose between Davis, Thomas, RHJ, Johnson, I'll guess Johnson and Davis.   \- I don't think players would have progressed in the way they did; OG would probably be the biggest sacrifice as he would have been on the bench.    \- Norm probably would have been the starting two, as FVV would fill the same role as the year prior. I don't think Nurse would have used Davis of Mccaw to act as Lowry's primary backup.     \- Pascal would have probably received an extension similar to FVV's current contract; wouldn't have exploded the way he did or gotten those accolades    \- Kawhi and Lowry probably would be the ASG reps   \- We honestly would have coasted but assuming seeding persists due to laziness, we would have probably beaten Boston. Miami was an anomaly but if I were to gamble I'd go Raptors going all the way.  &amp;#x200B;  2021-22, the bigger question mark:   \- FVV would have received money akin to GTJ did now   \- Boucher would have never received his contract; I don't even think Brissett or Watson would have even been in the squad last year   \- Ibaka would have been the starting center, and if Gasol didn't return we'd probably still end up with someone like Alex Len, or Ellenson from the 905   \- Since COVID hit every team, there were a ton of games at the start of the season where they were just one possession away from winning. Assume they win those and it wouldn't have taken til the All Star Break to reach .500   \- I don't think they beat the Bucks or the Nets.     If Kawhi still gets his injury, there may be a chance for job security he would have signed again. Otherwise, I'm sure the Lakers or Clippers would have picked his ass up the moment blood was in the water."
"I wonder if its Vogel insisting on playing DeAndre Jordan and the spacing is getting to him. I really think you guys need a stretch 5 like Muscala (he's very good now) or Lopez to pull off that roster. AD seems really hellbent on not playing the 5 in the regular season, so you need a guy who will bang for him down in the post defensively but stretch the offense enough to give ad space to work. Russ has been a good enough shooter to move to the corner now, so its helped a little bit, but I really do feel like DJ is fucking it up for everyone. You can say what you want about russ but that guy is a center whisperer. He made Alex Len look like a starting quality center in Washington. If he cant make DJ look good he's a lost cause."
Bruv Alex Len got a foul call and free throws for jamming the ball into the bottom of the backboard.  Refs just call shit for the sake of it
"You‚Äôre a absolutely right. AD had that one great shooting stretch in the playoffs and now he thinks he‚Äôs Dirk. Every time he settles for a jumper the defense is relieved but not only that, if he had more drive and a sense of urgency he‚Äôd be a sure fire top 5 player. As for LeBron, he‚Äôs settling for more 3s too and he‚Äôs struggling to get by guys like Alex Len and Al Horford. Now that could be either injury related, because I think he came back early, or age related. Either way both of these guys aren‚Äôt playing with enough effort."
Alex Len can log 35+ min and AD can‚Äôt even dominate the game.. guy has no motivation
Dude I agree with this so much I swear no one watches or understands D they just see someone making a layup over AD  The rest of the team are fucking always getting blown by or losing their man which forces AD to try and help but it‚Äôs late since it‚Äôs not his man  I saw bron lose buddy and Davis or whatever so many times on D as well as melo have 0 idea where his defender went cause he‚Äôs ball watching then the rest try to rotate but it‚Äôs late  They had Alex Len guarding AD and they did 0 lobs or PnR in OT so embarrassing
"Late screen, Alex Len was supposed to cut to the basket after the pick to draw in Melo so Fox could kick it to Bagley in the corner. Instead the top got crowded. 100% caused by late screen and failure to roll, not on Fox."
Alex Len is 5/10 from 3 this year
Alex Len made a shot???  Maybe he's better now but when he was with us I had more confidence in Trae hitting a shot blindfolded from the rafters than Alex putting it in from 5 feet away
Alex Len made a 3? Jesus what was going on
Is AD playing hurt? He should be dominating vs any team playing Alex Len 35+ min
Now I just imagine AD claiming Buddy Hield is using an aimbot and telling Alex Len he fucked his mom.
How Alex Len does still have NBA Job?
"When you help, you're giving up presence on the glass. Would have to watch the game to know whether AD was covering for a leaky perimeter or getting owned by Alex Len on the boards."
"Harkless. He started the game but left after 8 minutes with an injury so the Lakers got dad dicked by the future HoF duo of Alex Len and Marvin ""Don't call me a bagel"" Bagley"
"The rebounding was pathetic from the Lakers, made Alex Len look like freaking Wilt Chamberlain out there"
you spelled alex len wrong
you can‚Äôt spell All-NBA without Alex Len
no it‚Äôs not for one reason. 3 aging perennial allstars had to play an average of 50 minutes just to lose to Alex Len
Yep those Mid range shots he lissed late in the 4th killed all momentum he was allergic  to  Alex fucking Len disgusting performance
"Look, LeBron and Anthony Davis are HoF players and have seen it all. Seen it all...except for Alex Len and Marvin Bagley"
Alex Len really did well against Davis and Bron.
Alex Len played 37 minutes in this game.
"We were missing literally our entire starting front court for almost all of this game. We ran a Marvin Bagley/Alex Len combo for most of crunch time. We had Chimezie Metu and Terence Davis guarding LeBron at times. This is the gutsiest win I can remember, but the Lakers should be ashamed"
LeBron gets a Kings fan named Alex Len ejected from the game
Russ boxing out Alex Len lol
Fox trying to blame Alex Len? He waited until 6 seconds to start dribbling beyond the 3pt line
"He had him beat off the dribble, but then he saw elite rim protector Alex Len staring him down"
Alex Len rebounding like Prime Rodman is something
alex len was making sure he touched both of AD's arms
Alex Len really locked down Bron üíÄ
Alex Len confirmed not a bust?
Lol. Alex fucking Len showing out.
Alex Len is a beast
Westbrook wishes he could shoot like Alex Len
"You can't stop Alex len, you can only hope to contain him"
Lakers really selling to alex len
SUNS LEGEND ALEX LEN
Alex len is sooo bad
Alex Len can‚Äôt finish lol
Alex len is so bad
"Even when he has no one around him he averaged 30 and 10, throwing lobs to Alex Len and Damian Jones, the pieces-around-him argument is so bullshit. And Trae's only physical limitation is size (which he often uses to his advantage). He has insane speed/quickness and body control. Just because Ja almost dunks on people doesn't mean that Trae isn't more explosive, its just lateral explosion. Only argument is defense, but its not like Ja is a plus defender so it isn't really a argument breaker"
"Aye I feel you lol. For a while Alex Len was our starting center, shit was painful."
I'll take Alex Len at this point
But I saw some Kings fans arguing that Bagley does not deserve playing time over Alex Len.
"As someone who has watched most kings games over the past five years, I can say definitively that Alex Len, Tristan Thompson, and Mo Harkless are better basketball players right now than Marvin Bagley will ever be. He is in his fourth year in the league and has shown zero improvement or desire to help the team. He is objectively the worst defensive big man in the league and he is a black hole on offense who cannot score effectively. He is like if Jahlil Okafor had no post game. He is that bad. Anyone who thinks he can contribute at all to winning at the NBA level either has not watched him play or is delusional."
I‚Äôm sorry to burst your bubble but Alex Len probably is better than Marvin Bagley  But ya they should just cut him. I wonder if a team would even give up a second round pick for him
"Here's something I wrote for a different Kings post (after the Luke Walton firing).  ---------  As far as roster goes, I think everyone's movable at the right price. However, the biggest issue is the lack of decent players at every non-PG position. Peep their depth chart.  PG: Fox | Davion Mitchell | Jah'mius Ramsey  SG: Haliburton (also PG) | Terence Davis | Robert Woodard II  SF: Barnes | Hield | Mo Harkless  PF: Metu | Bagley  C: Holmes | Len | TT | Damian Jones  Let's get the first issue out of the way. Their roster stinks. They have maybe 5 rotation-level players (Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Holmes/Hield). But then what?  Davion Mitchell is an all-D, no-O rookie for now. Terence Davis has some scoring ability, but is rightfully stuck behind three decent guards and D Mitchell.  Mo Harkless has been a body at his recent stops. They've started Mo Harkless in 11 games. They started Chimezie Metu recently. Not saying either is bad bad, but would either even be getting playing time on most teams?  Alex Len has been hanging on in the league by a thread for a few years now and wouldn't be able to play onto most contenders' rosters. TT is washed (partially because of the direction the NBA took) and is a walking trade chip at this point.  Ramsey and Woodard would be two-ways at best on most teams. I don't think Damian Jones has ever been good, even when he was on the Warriors. And Bagley hardly plays.  You look at other mediocre rosters and they all either are clearly developmental (Rockets, Thunder) or they have at least 8-10 NBA level players on the roster, if not more.  The Warriors, Phoenix, Utah, Wizards, Nets, Bulls, Heat, Cavs, Bucks, 76ers, Hawks, Trail Blazers, Grizzlies, and Knicks all have a decent list of players who they can play who aren't complete liabilities (that's half the league, at least). Even for the 4-11 Spurs, you can point to 8 guys who should be on a contender's 10 man rotation (depending on positional excess). The Kings pretty much only have five rotation-quality players, and no amount of coaching will salvage that.  -----------  Their roster is talent-dry AND they don't enough have any assets worth a damn. They have +2 second rounders in total. That's it."
Do not disrespect future Suns statue subject Alex Len
"Alex Len and TT can play center, and Harkless can play defence. Bagley can't do either"
"I said that active team without Booker, and I honestly question your basketball knowledge if you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible. That team was rookie Tyler Ulis, Rookie Marquesse Chriss, rookie Dragan bender, Alex Len, rookie 2-way Derrick Jones Jr, 34 year old last season Barbosa, Jared Dudley, and 2-way Alan Williams.   There are less legit NBA players on that team than 3-4 college teams the last few years, including the Kentucky team DBook was on just two years before. The second best player outside of Booker might‚Äôve unironically been Jared Dudley. Half of them didn‚Äôt deserve an NBA spot, and have since clearly proven that.   College teams wouldn‚Äôt beat an NBA team, but that wasn‚Äôt an NBA team outside of Booker."
"This is a fucking brain dead take. Take off those extra free throws at the end of the game, he scored 64/8/6 as a 20 year old against the #1 seed in the East with his best teammate that game being Alex Len"
"Rest of the Suns scored 50 points on 39%, including an 11 point, 4-5 shooting performance from Alex Len"
"&gt;Sacramento then made obvious defensive-minded personnel moves in the offseason, such as drafting Davion Mitchell at No. 9, and acquiring Tristan Thompson, Maurice Harkless, Alex Len and Terence Davis  Lol"
"&gt;Sacramento then made obvious defensive-minded personnel moves in the offseason, such as drafting Davion Mitchell at No. 9, and acquiring Tristan Thompson, Maurice Harkless, Alex Len and Terence Davis  Lol"
"No, he went to Maryland after Wisconsin was coming off back to back Final Four runs. And his reasoning was because Mark Tergeron developed Alex Len. Like Kaminsky wasn‚Äôt a thing."
Put some respect on Flyin Ryan‚Äôs name. Man dunked on Kobe and the great Alex Len.
"Honestly, being good enough to be considered an All Star snub is a decent outcome for a 5th overall pick. There was a five-year span when the fifth picks were Thomas Robinson, Alex Len, Dante Exum, Mario Hezonja, and Kris Dunn.   I agree about Wagner though. He‚Äôs gonna go really high in re-drafts of a draft that will produce a ton of really good players."
"We are better than losing games to the Thunder, Spurs, and Timberwolves. No offense to those teams, but we really do have better personnel. I think you are underrating what we've got on our team: several great supporting pieces with no real star. Fox has been in a slump lately, but I've been very happy with the play of Hield, Holmes, Barnes, Haliburton, and Mitchell, and we've gotten more out of guys like Metu, Len, and Harkless than I've expected. Really the only rotation guys I'm disappointed in are Bagley, Davis, and Thompson (and TT is supposed to be the vet on the team and in the locker room, which he seems to be doing well).  Luke has had some atrocious rotations in the past, like pitifully bad. He's doing marginally better this year but I think he's still making poor decisions with our guards -- while Buddy off the bench is a good start, he needs to stagger Fox and Haliburton more. His big usage is okay but not ideal at times -- there are quite a few times when we are facing a big center and he chooses not to switch Len in when our smaller bigs are getting bullied, and I know Alex Len is not great but he has proven he can defend bigger centers for some time. (Also this may just be a me thing, but I have no idea why Damian Jones gets minutes. Every other big on our roster has a more defined role than him.) The offense has slowed down significantly under Walton, and under Joerger we were the fastest offense in the league, which also helped our defense out by tiring out opposing offenses. Joerger's defensive schemes also did a way better job than Walton's at masking our weaknesses on defense. I don't expect us to be great, but we certainly should've been better than last (or near last, I can't remember) last year with the personnel on hand. There's not one specific thing he does that I don't like, and I'm not a coach myself, but it was clear that Joerger's defensive schemes just worked better overall. The ideal position for us would be keeping up a similar level of offense (5thish in the league) while going to about league average in defense, with better defensive schemes and rotations being the solution to that. I'm not one to hate on every coach we've had, but I knew this one was a bad signing from the start.  And for the record, a lot of fans were still upset with Vlade over the Bagley pick. Any excitement was due to the fact that Bagley actually looked decent after year one, and that there was room to grow further. I know there are also some ride-or-dies that I won't make fun of for supporting a good season (by our standards) and having hope for the future is not a bad thing. I'm already much happier with McNair, even if the bar was near the floor. He's picked BPA in drafts and it's paid off, and has made a few shrewd trades and signings for our bench. I'd love to give him a few more years at the least to tinker with the roster a bit more heavily, but even with the roster we have I expect more out of it.  TL;DR I really dislike Luke Walton in particular for specific reasons and want him gone."
"Let's just say out of Alex Len, Hassan Whiteside, Damian Jones, and Chimezie Metu, he's easily the worst"
Bruh the Hawks had a tribute to Alex Len last year.
"Powell is averaging 7/4/1 with an average 17.9 PER this year and for his career. Damien Jones is career averaging 4/3/1 with a 14.4 PER. Alex Len is averaging 7/6/0 on 15.4 PER for his career.     So yes, Damien Jones was significantly worse than Powell, and he and Alex Len are about equals"
"lukas teammates end up becoming spot up shooters because thats who they are.  KP and THJ are spot shooters, KP especially hates going to the rim unless its wide open.   look how much better and smoother their offense looks with a secondary creator like brunson sharing the floor with luka  are you trying to tell me alex len and damian jones are worse than dwight powell?  that man cannot jump. he calls for lobs and teammates ignore him because nobody trusts him to finish them.  you think luka can't run a PNR with collins when he has one of the best PNR games in the league?  and they still dont have a real center, KP can't play center.  they only have boban who can barely play any minutes.  if KP tries to play center he will probably get hurt again"
Luka is so ball dominant his teammates end up becoming spot up shooters.   Whereas Trae gets his points while also involving his teammates in the flow of the offense. Collins and Capela would not thrive nearly as much under Luka as they do Trae. Trae was averaging 29 and 9 throwing lobs to fucking Alex Len and Damian Jones ffs
"Lmao when we were running rotations of Bruno Fernando, Alex Len and Dewayne Dedmon Trae averaged 30-10. Trae can get lobs up to anyone even porzingis"
"Russ was doing too much, but let's go over what he was working with outside of Beal:  Bryant: played 10 games  Rui: credited Russ with improving, literally your third best player as a second year player that isn't playing at all this year  Bertans: injured and played awful, was meant to be one of your key pieces  Deni Avdija: was one of your better players even though he didn't get much playing time. This is sad, he was a rookie that mostly brought defensive help.  Ish Smith: Ish is a solid backup PG, isn't meant to be more.  Alex Len: god awful  Robin Lopez: He's washed at this stage  Garrison Matthews: Started 24 games, played in 64, and is now in the G-league.   Gafford came in late into the year and they were winning.   Covid and injuries were not the cherry on top, your team was garbage.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/WAS/2021.html  You can go through your own team and tell me how I'm wrong.  Outside of Beal you guys basically have none of your core players from last year and the majority of your core players from last year sucked. You replaced Russ with quality depth, adding in 3 new players, Gafford became a starter, you signed Dinwiddie, and Bertans isn't expected to be one of your best players anymore opposed to a damn 10th man even though he's being paid 17 million.  Russ and beal both played hero ball as your team was trash, quite literally.  Lakers this year, without Lebron, are again not really the best team because we went in on 3 guys and old players and the inconsistency to start the season is massive. Russ isn't a superstar anymore, but the problems go far deeper than him."
"- I mean we were 17-6 after we acquired Gafford last year. Much better than running Mo Wagner, Robin Lopez, and Alex Len.  - Westbrook lost us at least 5 games at the beginning of the season, and Scott Brooks probably lost us another 5-10 with his poor lineup managed, inability to coach in the last few minutes, and pure incompetence.  - We added Dinwiddie, KCP, Kuzma, Harrell ... in place of Westbrook, Matthews, Bonga/Hutchison, and Lopez/Len. Big boost in quality role players.   - We still haven't seen Thomas Bryant or Rui Hachimura this year.   - Bertans has been out awhile  - Beal has actually been playing like ass, we should get better when he's on form again."
"We've had to see Ayton show off a post move every 20 games and then previous to that the likes of Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, Tyson Chandler, and Alex Len.  Kaminsky showing his post moves for us is like cavemen discovering fire."
Alex Len (or Svi) vs. Mozgov a few years ago   Ukraine and Russia have been at war since 2014.
"Bam‚Äôs big weakness is big centers like Jokic, Lopez, even Alex Len played well against Bam  He just can‚Äôt defend them and he shrivels up when going against bigger guys"
I love how Alex Len thinks it goes down after the first spin or two and just starts running back on defense
"We had Aron Baynes and Alex Len who were both trash, we ended up giving Boucher a lot more time at the 5 but he's undersized and doesn't really have the BBIQ for it - despite people assuming he's a defense prodigy because he gets cool blocks once in awhile. We got Khem Birch late in the season and he looked like a god in comparison but he's a backup level talent, and he's also undersized.  Now we have Precious who is also undersized as a 5. Our 4/5 depth is Pascal, Precious, Boucher, and Khem. Khem and Precious are the only ones who should play C and only as backups"
Alex Len- Most Improved Player
"Besides drafting Booker, Ayton (obvious number 1 pick), and Bridges. He also drafted Marquess Chriss, Alex Len, papagiannis, and Bender. Also traded both morris brothers for nothing. I'm sure the owner did play a factor but his resume is average I think"
And signing Alex Len.
Dame was a 5th pick that year. Even if they had the exact same record and had the same 5th pick it doesn‚Äôt guarantee a superstar. The next 4 draftees at #5 are Alex Len 2013. Dante Exum 2014. Mario Henzonja 2015. Kris Dunn 2016. Plenty of other too picks are misses as well.   That‚Äôs assuming they never improve and are able to pick 5th every year. It‚Äôs more than losing games and getting high picks. Just gotta hit when you do. And pick up quality free agents.   Obviously they could‚Äôve picked different players but the point stands that having high picks isn‚Äôt the problem as much as hitting the picks like they did with McCollum. Tanking doesn‚Äôt guarantee you anything.   I‚Äôd rather win 50 games and try to trade or get free agents to join me. That‚Äôs Portlands biggest issue. Warriors were a 50 win team then they picked up Iggy. Lakers MO is free agency. Bucks traded for Jrue Holiday. Raptors traded for Kawhi. Portland sucks at getting Dame help through other means.
"this game felt like last year's Kings on defense. we won because the Pels didn't have their best guys, and because we blew up in the fourth quarter for once. Fox and Haliburton both looked good at the same time for the first time all year.  kinda scared to say it but I might like Alex Len?"
"You know what? You're right, the Alex Len signing might be what really blew his cover, hence the waive"
He wanted to show Canada that a Ukrainian could actually be good at basketball after Alex Len left a poor taste in our mouths
"Low key Masai intentionally did that shit before the season. Alex Len, Baynes, Stanimal, Matt Thomas and Bembry were in the rotation"
Trae was lobbing it to Alex Len and Damian Jones when the Hawks were tanking and his assist numbers were still better than Luka's.  Atleast do research before making claims.
"Last year we beat them in a game where Alex Len hit 3 corner 3s, it was time for the bullshit pendulum to swing the other way."
"I always think that you need to evaluate a pick relative to the players who could have been picked in that spot. There's always going to be someone better taken way deeper in the draft, but the point is usually that NOBODY saw that guy coming.  Most of the time teams are, in practice, choosing between 3-5 players. So the question is, was the guy taken better than the next 3-5 guys taken?  So with Kendall Marshall, both John Henson and Mo Harkless had better careers, and they were the next two picks. That makes it a clear bad pick. (IN fact, four of the next five picks had better careers. Oof.)  On the other hand, Alex Len - you look at the next few picks, and they're not clearly better than Alex Len by a large margin until you get to CJ McColumn. So you say he wasn't worthy of the #5 pick but that's actually fairly typical return for a #5 pick: solid rotation guy, nothing special. So that's not a bad pick.   TJ Warren went two picks ahead of Nurkic, but was better than the other guys around there. Solid pick.  Devin Booker was picked ahead of a bunch of other decent players, which makes that pick look ever better. Lots of plausible picks and they got the best one!  Dragan Bender, OTOH, is an awful pick. The guys taken after him (Dunn, Hield, Murray, Chriss, Poetl) are all better.   And Josh Jackson is more borderline than I think you're giving them credit for. D'Aaron Fox, Johnathan Issac, Lauri Markinnen, Frank Nkitolina, Dennis Smith, Jr? Josh is neither the best nor the worst of those players. Going to the G-league as a rookie isn't a bit deal for a young guy. He look to have the makings of a serviceable backup big.  2018 obviously they should have taken Luka.   2019 since they must have drafted for the trade, hard to evaluate based on thee quality of the player.   And with Smith they could have had Haliburton ... and now they declined his option? Wow. Yeah. Huge mistake.  So there are a couple of howlers there, but also some of those picks aren't as bad as they look."
"That face when Alex Len is 100x more valuable than the 4 other top-10 picks (Jalen Smith \[10\], Josh Jackson \[4\], Dragan Bender \[4\], Marquese Chriss \[7\]) in the past 15 years the Suns have had combined.  Apparently the Suns just need to draft in the low-teens from now on.  * Cam Johnson -- 11th pick 2019 * Devin Booker -- 13th pick 2015 * TJ Warren -- 14th pick 2014 * Kendall Marshall -- 13th pick 2012  (Fucking eww, never knew why we did this) * Markieff Morris -- 13th pick 2011 (Even with him being a dickhead, he's still a serviceable NBA player) * Earl Clark -- 14th pick 2009 (We held out hope for so long on him) * Robin Lopez -- 15th pick 2008 (We bitched about him so much until we lost him and had Len as a starter, who we bitched about until we lost him and had continuous garbage as starters until Ayton)"
Something about Alex Len being a top 5 pick cracked me up
&gt; He was pretty loved at Maryland  So was 4th pick Alex Len...
"I want to point out that Alex Len made two 3s against the Suns last game, after only making 1 for his whole Kings tenure. Alex Len revenge game."
Alex Len is not pleased at all X_X
That's Kings legend Alex Len to you! Dude is inexplicably good on a Luke Walton team lol
Give Russ some credit though. Look at his supporting cast from last year.  He had to rely on players like Alex Len lmao
"Could I, perhaps, interest you in 16 minutes of Alex Len, 16 minutes of Robin Lopez, and 16 minutes of Daniel Gafford?"
"I mean you also have to look at the fact that we have :  KCP, Kuzma, and Harrell replacing .... Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga/Chandler Hutchison, and Alex Len/Robin Lopez  And WUJ replacing Scott Brooks ..."
Alex Len used to be good for us kings
Cause we played the ghost of Aron Baynes and his crime partner the ghost of NBA past Alex Len who have contributed in less than 0 ways somehow. Lost 4 games by a total of 15 points and very easily could've been 4-6. Raptors aren't the 2-8 they've started at and I'm sure by the end of January well see than trend back to where they should be.
Can we interest you in an Alex Len or an Aron Baynes?
"People were clowning Alex Len when he dubbed him baby Kawhi, but it‚Äôs not looking quite so far off if you‚Äôre comparing him to early SA Kawhi. Doesn‚Äôt do too much on offense and gives tremendous effort on defense. Plays with a ton of confidence but also isn‚Äôt the loudest voice in the locker room.  For as much hype as reddish gets, Hunter is clearly better right now"
Thought it was Lou Williams randomly deciding to shit on Aron Baynes and Alex Len for a second lol
Maybe if we had a center who wasn't complete garbage then we could win a game.  Fucking Aaron Baynes.   Alex Len we knew would be terrible.
Isn't that what you guys were hyping Alex Len for lmao
How to cut Alex Len on a road trip? Asking for a friend
"We lost Kawhi, Danny Green, Ibaka and Gasol, and replaced them with Stanley Johnson, Alex Len and Aron Baynes."
Alex Len: hello
No but I did expect better centers than Alex Len and Aron Baynes to replace Ibaka and Gasol
Alex Len with a triple zero üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤
Alex Len couldn't box out RoCo on a free throw.
Alex Len is class player lmao   cant get the rebound foul again
Holy shit. Fuck Alex Len.
Alex Len just out there running suicides
Alex Len? No pls
He's already more NBA caliber than Alex Len at this stage of the season
Ukrainian mamba Alex Len is pretty fast for a big man
Alex Len is so bad positionally on the defensive end. Raptor fans were spoiled by Gasol and Ibaka.
Alex Len isn't just bad. He actively does things to piss me off. Clear Path Fouls. Technical Fouls. OFFENSIVE GOALTENDING.
"We just dont have enough guys that can play winning basketball and those that can, have started slow. Like this is our Championship rotation players:  Kyle Lowry - Still plays at a high level  Danny Green - Went to LA  Kawhi Leonard - Went to LA  Pascal Siakam - Plays at a high level. Had a slow start and has picked it back up, but his regression is completely exaggerated because of the bubble.   Marc Gasol - Went to LA  Fred VanVleet - Still plays at a high level but is sometimes inconsistent in scoring due to his size.  Norman Powell - Has looked like a shell of himself so far and his BBIQ looks like GoDaddy curse Norm from [year 3](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/powelno01.html).  OG Anunoby - His defense is good, but his shot has been off so far. We were hoping he would take a leap in the scoring department after the bubble, but he still can't create buckets for himself.  Serge Ibaka - Went to LA  So last season, we lost Kawhi and Danny but we were still able to compete at a high level because we had 7 solid players. Our depth wasnt the best which is why Nurse would heavily rely on the likes of our 7 Championship vets. [Look at the MPG for the playoffs last season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2020.html)  While we played well, our two biggest weaknesses were rebounding and halfcourt offense, none of which were addressed in the offseason.  We also lost Gasol and Ibaka, who while looked like they were past their primes, provided solid defense at the rim and good offense. Marc couldnt score, but his passing was phenomenal, and Ibaka was able to get buckets consistently from midrange and 3. They both also brought a veteran poise and IQ to the team.  They were replaced with Alex Len and Aron Baynes. Baynes has struggling on offense, he cant even make open layups, and Alex Len, is a bonafide scrub.  So our bench mob became our starters and our bench is thin and full of gleaguers. Terrence Davis hasnt played much and is struggling a bit. Boucher has been great but he lack size.  So were a small team and a lot of our talent has been stripped. Our key vets have had some off games early and that can be attributed to getting adjusted with a new team as well as offcourt things like having to be in Tampa and essentially every game being a road one."
"We went from one of the best center rotations in the league to Alex Len and Aron Baynes, with both of them falling out of our rotation already. That‚Äôs pretty bad on its own.          Pascal has been playing better, but there is also lack of scoring talent on that team. Fred, Kyle, Pascal and Chris Boucher are the only reliable scorers in the entire squad.           I think Raptors will be in lottery this year."
"&gt;We have no big men,  What's wrong with Alex Len?  He's been a decent backup center in the league for several years."
"And not only that, but we replaced them with Aaron Baynes and Alex Len...sad times"
Aron Baynes and Alex Len*  Chris Boucher has actually been legit
"They lost Gasol AND Ibaka. Meanwhile, those two have become the primary centers for both LA teams. Boucher has stepped up impressively (still mad we let him walk away from SeaDubs without a contract, along with Devonte Graham and Kendrick Nunn), but their only true center Aron Baynes understandably pails in comparison this far.  The reason Wiseman only played like 10 minutes is because the Raptors didn‚Äôt play an actual center the entire second half.  EDIT: they also gave Alex Len, both he and Baynes received a DNP-CD ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Yeah but alex len doesn‚Äôt contribute either, whiteside at least will grab 12 rebounds a game which is something we desperately need, we‚Äôre literally the worst rebounding team in the league."
They will take Alex Len and they will like it.
"how r u saying that bc a countries elections have had accusations of frauds that the players must be easily fudging their ages lol?  Ukraine has also had widespread accusations of election fraud, for example, but I'm not out here saying Alex Len is lying about his age lol  &gt;I know enough about Africa (and speak an African language)   lmao"
"They had us in the first quarter, not gonna lie lmao. Kings couldn't miss to start the game, got open layups and threes whenever they wanted, and nearly put up 50 in a quarter. Haliburton is not a fucking rookie out there; he has the poise and composure of a seasoned vet, and creates so many good looks for his teammates.   However, Raps hunkered down defensively once they subbed out the corpse of Alex Len for Boucher, and ran with their length and athleticism. The bench finally had a great game, moving the ball and spacing the floor, with Siakam generating a ton of good looks with his improved passing out of double teams and the post. Malachi Flynn continues to earn more minutes with his play on both ends, and he's gaining more and more rhythm and confidence with each passing game. This was a great preview into a future Raptors backcourt post-Lowry, with FVV bombing away from deep and converting tough finishes at the rim, and Malachi orchestrating the P/R with great passing reads!   The first feel-good win of the season for the Raps, hopefully they can build off this and return to their winning ways!"
Today's lesson: release Aron Baynes and Alex Len immediately.
Based on tonight's result: Alex Len and Aron Baynes.
"Today's lesson, never let Aron Baynes or Alex Len play again."
Aron Baynes and Alex Len are making a combined 10 mil this year.  They have 1 combined point the last 3 games. One.
Alex len for a double double. Calling it right now
Poor Alex Len isn‚Äôt even another player? :(
Alex Butter Fingers Len
"Mainly there for the size and fouls, frustratingly. At 27, there's not much development/skill squeeze to prune out of Len.  Rebounding + lobs + simple hookshot. That's the best Alex Len offense you can get."
Alex Len managed to be tied for a team low -10 in just 11 minutes should tell you all you need to know.
"I‚Äôm honestly depressed now, who would‚Äôve guessed that starting Alex Len for all of those games was going to derail our 2021 season üòî"
"He's trash, that's why denver should trade him to Raptors for Alex Len and a pick"
Can confirm. We have Stanley Johnson and Alex Len.
Sooo terrible. I cringe everytime the ball heads in his direction. No difference between him and Alex Len. At times Len is better.
"&gt; They got Baynes, Thomas, Alex Len, Stanley Johnson, Terrance Davis, Bembry, RHJ, Flynn  So basically no one."
"holly hell he's been bad compared to last year.  can't shoot anymore, is slower on D, and can't finish his bunnies.  he's going to lose minutes to Alex Len pretty soon"
"No one really.   They got Baynes, Thomas, Alex Len, Stanley Johnson, Terrance Davis, Bembry, RHJ, Flynn  Like some decent players where some could potentially carve out roles in a playoff rotation. But downgrades compared to Kawhi, Green, Ibaka, Gasol."
"Baynes is not a perennial loser, he‚Äôs just not a center you can rely on playing starter minutes. He can play solid D, set good screens, and fight under the basket to tip the board. He would also botch simple put backs or have a pass/rebound slip through his hands. I‚Äôve never seen Alex Len do anything positive going back to his Phoenix days"
"Nah bro, Rockets would be lucky to get Alex Len and a 2027 2nd rounder for that bum Harden."
"""alex len bad""  *Raptors: C Alex Len scores 101 points vs. Kings*"
Any team that signs Alex Len is bound to be trash. It‚Äôs the way of lifeüòÇ
alex len?
"My god. I just want somebody to hold our ""centers"" accountable. Yea this team right now isn't doing too well but Aron Baynes and Alex Len are absolute trash. Really shows the impact Marc and Serge had"
"The lack of a reliable C who can play big, consistent minutes should not be underrated as a limiting factor on team success. Baynes is limited and can‚Äôt survive a big role (though I still like him), and Alex Len isn‚Äôt reliable."
"Feeling this, but also feeling like the Raptors are not so good. The lack of a reliable C who can play big, consistent minutes should not be underrated as a limiting factor on team success. Baynes is limited and can‚Äôt survive a big role, and Alex Len isn‚Äôt reliable."
"they went from a marc/ibaka center rotation to baynes/alex len, siakam has regressed/been figured out, and they lost the best player from that warriors beating core"
"pretty clearly a good call, FVV was out of bounds, acording to the rules Alex Len was right.  &amp;#x200B;  [https://prnt.sc/wgeoqv](https://prnt.sc/wgeoqv)"
Bobby filled this team with bums.  Terrence Davis  Stanley Johnson  Aaron Baynes  Alex Len  DeAndre Bembry   And we couldnt even bring back RHJ who was solid defensively and hustled his ass off????
Why is Alex Len posting up lmaoo
Alex Len is JV without Direct TV
honestly surprised Alex Len is still in the league
This is the Alex Len experience summed up
Yep that‚Äôs Alex Len for you
What's wrong with Alex Len?  at least  he's way more agile than baynes and can actually dunk from 1 foot
"The Toronto Raptors are currently ranked 28th in offensive rating (103). Is this a small sample size or is the offensive slippage a cause for concern?  Without Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol, they've inserted Aaron Baynes and Alex Len into their lineups. I would've thought that removing Gasol would've made the defense suffer, but in terms of DRTG, they've basically been chugging along fine (currently at a 105, good for fifth place in the league)."
You guys have Alex Len the biggest bust in nba history playing rotational minutes. Plus Baynes is not a starter anymore. He‚Äôs a bench guy at best especially at his age.  Y‚Äôall still make the playoffs though but you got significant worse than last year losing your bigs.
Calling Alex Len average is generous
It‚Äôs especially refreshing cuz we don‚Äôt have to watch Damian Jones and Alex Len anymoreüòÇ
"Alex Len, Stanley Johnson and a top protected 1st rounder  for  James Harden, PJ Tucker and 2 lotto protected first rounders, 2nd rounder (conditional)"
Alex Len is trash
"here's another one for you op ""masai isn't getting enough criticism for waiving alex len"""
"i haven't seen the Wiz on this win streak, but are they seriously winning with a starting lineup of Alex Len, Anthony Gill, and Raul Neto?"
"Alex Len. He must have the worst hands in the league, trae would feed him a wide open look under the basket and len would fumble the pass every fuckin time"
He averaged nearly 10 assist last year with Alex Len and Damian Jones as the Big men with lights out shooters like 42 year old Vince Carter and Bembry on the perimeter
"Currently, Bruno Fernado suckos.    Former, Old Vince Carter was pretty bad, but also Alex Len was bad too. Stone hands."
"and how is he ignoring the team success? has he not led an empty OKC team to the playoffs? he is now taking the fucking Washington Wizards with players like Garrison Matthews, Raul Neto and Alex Len to the playoffs  everybody is talking about Curry winning MVP when GSW has 4 more wins on the season than Wizards. nobody is talking about Westbrook because he made triple doubles the new everyday normal, he is that ridiculous  &gt;he would just benefit greatly from better shot selection.  it aint that bad, it's just a narrative constantly being thrown around from casuals and haters. man is leading the league in clutch fg%"
"With Alex Len and Raul Neto in the starting 5, no less"
"You started well then injuries derailed your season. I know Nate is doing well with injuries. Still though, this was the first competent roster LP had. I think he was put on the clock unfairly when Chandler Parsons, Evan Turner, Alex Len, Dedmon, Vince Carter and Jabari Parker all played a lot of minutes last season, some of them even playing starter minutes for extended periods. Almost all those guys are effectively retired now (VC and Evan Turner are literally retired). Once you lose the locker room like Lloyd Pierce clearly did there's no turning back no matter the circumstances. He was fired the moment Nate Mcmillan was hired as his assistant."
"\5. The little bumps and jabs of Robin Lopez Break up the Wiz! Washington has won eight of nine to pull ahead of the Chicago Bulls and Toronto Raptors in the slap-fight for the last Eastern Conference play-in spot. Chicago and Toronto own head-to-head tiebreakers over Washington, but the Wiz have one of the league's easiest remaining schedules. They also have two games left against the wobbling Indiana Pacers, now just two games ahead at No. 9. (Washington is 1-0 against Indiana, so a split gives them that tiebreaker.)  The Wiz look more like the team a lot of us expected before the virus upended their season. Russell Westbrook has been a net positive over the past month, and he's 36-of-63 in the last five minutes of close games. Bradley Beal is scorching after a brief injury absence. Davis Bertans found his jumper. Their defense, once laughable, has stiffened.  The Wiz are getting two-way production from their old-school three-headed center rotation of Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford. I have no idea how that's a thing in the year of our basketball gods 2021, but it is. Len is fine as token starter. Gafford has been a rim-running, shot-blocking revelation since the Wiz acquired him from Chicago in an exchange of players so random it reads like some NBA geek's trade deadline Mad Libs.  Lopez is averaging 9.7 points on 69% shooting since March 1. He has cracked 15 points in seven of his past 13 games. For a selfless bruiser, that represents an explosion. Lopez has been money with his floor-scraping, ice-cream-scoop hook shot. The Wiz have scored 1.17 points per possession when Lopez shoots from the post or passes to a teammate who launches -- sixth (!) among 80 players with at least 50 post touches, per Second Spectrum data.  Lopez remains a devoted box-out maestro, and an expert at getting teammates open. He's always nudging and jostling defenders to pry open space for Washington's shooters.  Watch the little shoulder check he lays on poor De'Anthony Melton in the left corner, unlocking a layup for Bertans: https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/Lopez_2gif.mp4  Lopez strolls in Melton's general area before veering into him. He looks like some high school punk deliberately bumping someone in the hallway to start a fight."
"&gt; I)  The subtle magic of Stephen Curry  How do you get open when all five defenders are focused on you? We know the common methods. Curry can roast his guy one-on-one, leveraging the threat of the most accurate jumper in league history. He can use a screen from Draymond Green, rumbling into open space more often now with James Wiseman injured -- and the Warriors playing more with Green at center.  Those two make such magic together. What they have is really why we follow basketball. It is what every player searches for, but few find: a hoops soulmate who amplifies your game, sees the floor through your eyes, and reads your intentions the moment you do. Some of their greatest mutual highlights are the product of improvisation -- tweaking some tried-and-true action at the last second because of something only they visualize.  But one of my favorite Steph-isms, on full brilliant display during this incandescent month, is the game of hide-and-seek Curry plays in the chaos of transition.  He seems disinterested, casual. Then he stops and turns his back to the rim. What? Is he setting a back screen? It looks that way. That's not it, though. Curry spies Alex Len loitering near the paint -- far from his man (Kevon Looney). What Curry is really doing is waiting for Looney. Once Looney arrives, Curry slips behind him.  Curry sprints diagonally, and right into Jayson Tatum. As he makes contact, Curry motions for Andrew Wiggins to pop out -- as if that's the plan. Nope. Wiggins cuts to the rim, and both defenders follow him. Green finishes the con job with a glance at Wiggins before shoveling to Curry.  Curry is one of one. The league has never seen this level of on-ball potency and off-ball relentlessness in the same player. Most churning off-ball rovers run around the way they do because they can't do much with the ball. They need to catch it at the right angle, with the right amount of space, to get their shots off. Curry can contort himself into a triple from anywhere, anytime. There are no boundaries to his creativity.  That is so calculated. Curry goes right around that first Green pick. Green is open. The pass is there. But Curry senses that by reversing course, he can drag Davis Bertans a few extra feet from Kent Bazemore -- and craft an easier shot.  Curry probably isn't winning MVP if the Warriors finish around .500, but he has planted himself in the conversation. As of now, I would guess the three names to appear on the most ballots would be Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Curry.  But Curry's magnificent season is more important for what it portends. He has reestablished himself as a first-team All-NBA-level player. He is already something beyond a franchise icon. Golden State owes Curry an honest effort at chasing championships over the next three seasons.  The biggest question in the league -- the one the Warriors must ask themselves each day -- is how close they are with Green, Curry, and Klay Thompson returning from two devastating injuries, and their current supporting cast. The answer depends in part on external variables: Who might rise and fall in the West? But factoring in age-related decline for all three stars and rust for Thompson, the safest assumption is the Warriors need something else to pop.  It might not have to be something huge -- the addition of another star via some megatrade that would involve one or both of Wiseman and the shiny Minnesota Timberwolves pick Golden State owns. It could be internal growth from a couple of key guys, including Wiseman making a huge leap soon.  Regardless: This Curry -- this destroyer -- demands prioritizing the immediate future."
"Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm wrong, but he doesn‚Äôt Seem bad to me. Might be because our center rotation last year was Alex Len Damian Jones and Bruno fernando"
"It wasn‚Äôt even that we replaced our bigs with replacement level players, it was that we swapped them with literally nothing. Baynes and Alex Len, both trash. Siakam, OG and Boucher, all wings, had to play C. Now that we have average C‚Äôs again we‚Äôre looking like a playoff team at the very least."
"if you dont think alex len and josh jackson are enough to make the playoffs in the west, idk what to tell you     thats clearly enough to get it done if book was that guy"
Hawks fans said the same thing about Trae and Alex Len. Good to know he still has brick hands.
Imagine how many assists he would have if he weren‚Äôt throwing passes to Avdija and Alex Len
"Yes. Westbrook while pretty inefficient is a FORCE going to the rim. RoLo has some very nice post moves, Hachimura is a good mid range shooter and finisher, Alex Len while not amazing does his role as a center, etc. etc."
"As if getting self made buckets off the dribble is all there is to basketball. This team was 20-47 last season because we didn‚Äôt have a center like Clint who could defend the paint against anyone AND grab the rebound off the miss almost every time. Literally, going from Damian Jones and Alex Len to Capela and a rookie has gotten us at least 8 extra wins. Trae is not worth that many wins himself. We would be where the Bulls are without him. Without Trae, we‚Äôd be hovering where the Hornets are. He‚Äôs actually been bad for most games this season"
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
Clint may not be our best player but he‚Äôs probably our second most important player. Going from Alex fucking Len to Clint is crazy.
"33% from 3 isn‚Äôt elite efficiency. Also, you‚Äôre severely underestimating how bad brooks is. Put harden out there with ish Smith and Neto they are not taking the league by storm. Pair him with Lopez and Alex Len for the season. There are only a couple of nba level players on that team. Len couldn‚Äôt even cut it as the 3rd center for the raptors and he starts for the wizards. He‚Äôs even gotten some 15-20 pt nights just off Westbrook. He‚Äôs literally the reason some of these guys even deserve to play. Gafford wasn‚Äôt even playing for the bulls and he just had a career night off of feeding off Westbrook"
"&gt;	How exactly is a 14-6 run and beating Milwaukee, Philly, and Brooklyn delusional?   Kings also went on a 10-5 run with wins over Lakers, GSW, San Antonio and Boston.            This at at its best was barely above 500, with an easy schedule.            Also, comparing this team to the 2019/2020 is very foolish. Pascal was playing at a very high level until his injury. He was literally in MVP discussion for a while. He is still good but not close to that. And it‚Äôs very evident that we need a closer that he was that season.              Also, Raptors went from one of the best center rotations in the league to Alex Len and Aaron Baynes. I literally called it out in preseason that it is going to be a rough year with this center rotation. That shouldn‚Äôt have been a hottake either."
"You asked what a competent big would add to the team, my comment was implying that it will add a significant replacement over Alex Len"
"&gt; Alex Len  That's not really an answer to my post, I'm assuming."
You haven't seen Alex Len play im assuming
Robin Lopez and Alex Len don‚Äôt have much mobility. If they contest a shot or have to box out a center they‚Äôre likely not getting the board. Usually either Russ or deni get the rebound. I would say deni has better positioning but Russ gets up for most of his boards and chases them
Imagine if it was Thomas Bryant with Gafford and Rolo off the bench instead of fucking Alex Len starting.
wizards still got better than Alex Len.
Robin Lopez and Alex Len\*
"Ayton has that Greg oden 40 year old man vibe but man he‚Äôs good. I‚Äôd love a player like that on the kings, we haven‚Äôt had a strong inside defensive presence since boogie. Alex Len was okay for us but I‚Äôd love someone to clog the paint (whiteside could be that guy, but he puts in no effort)"
"Playing with Alex Len isn‚Äôt a reason to not try and be better on defense.  Westbrook is at 1.02 points per transition possession, which is 30.1th percentile. No LeBron and Giannis are not the only two players shooting better than 58% in transition and other players are are more efficient transition shooter despite having a lower FG% because they also shoot 3s in transition, and turning the ball over isn‚Äôt better than missing a shot. Westbrook also didn‚Äôt need to average 10+ RPG last season to be a league leader in transition possessions used.  It‚Äôs possible to have a good defense without any one player getting double digit rebounds. Adams pretty much alone though would have been enough that defensive rebounding wasn‚Äôt going to be a problem, and the Thunder were not gaining any benefit from having Adams avoid grabbing rebounds he easily could have gotten so Westbrook could get a few more than he was getting prior to his first triple double season. Getting rid of Capala allowed Westbrook to have by far his best stretch of games since 2017, and despite rebounding being a weakness of that Rockets Westbrook was not asked to try and grab 10+ RPG. And him getting a triple double now doesn‚Äôt make him a star when he is the second best player on a team on pace to win low 30 wins in a normal 82 game season."
"&gt;Part of the problem here is those other stats don't actually measure anything well. Individual defense rebounding is extremely overrated as a stat.  I agree with rebounding to some extent but he's on a team where he's clearly the best rebounder so they need that from him. If this was a team with great rebounders then I'd say that it matters less. Also, the counterpoint to this would be PACE. Every team he's been on has been at least (off the top of my head) top 7 in PACE. At some point, we have to admit that his rebounding directly affects the team's pace. This year, the Wizards are 1st in PACE so it means more transition oppurtunities. I agree with you still with individual defensive rebounding being extremely overrated but I think with the context I've provided (the fact that he's their best rebounder and transition oppurutinties), it has to hold at least SOME value here.  &gt;The underrated aspect I think is the scoring component of playmaking. This is something that prime Westbrook was brilliant at, the pressure he put on the rim creating opportunities for his teammates and thus contributed to his playmaking.  Post-ASB, this is Russ. I think he really needed that. I'm not going to say he's as good as he was in his prime this year but I see a lot of similarities. The amount of pressure he has created post-ASB on the rim is ridiculous. It honestly feels like I'm watching MVP Russ again outside of the 3pt%.   The assists are kinda valuable on this team too. Only Beal can create his own shot and Rui is kinda getting there but it isn't completely reliable yet. But guys like Alex Len, Deni, Bertans, Gafford, Lopez need that. I would even argue that a guy like Beal needs Russ to set him up for easy buckets as well."
"&gt;And the Wizards are 26th in defensive rating.  My guy, the Wizards have started Alex Len at center for a while now. Do you think any team would have a top 25 DRTG starting Alex Len?  &gt;I don‚Äôt get why we need to be so precious about Westbrook‚Äôs transition opportunities when he isn‚Äôt even efficient in transition.  His FG% in transition is 58%. That's 4% less than Giannis. That's higher than Fox, Harden, KD, Booker, Curry, Kyrie, Mitchell... the list goes on. The only players with high who are more efficient are LeBron/Giannis.  &gt;He has played with good rebounders post Durant who had their lowest amount of defensive rebounds per possession of their careers playing with Westbrook chasing triple doubles.  Literally only Steven Adams and Harden. Capela for a short time."
"1) he‚Äôs actually playing above average defense this year   2) who the fuck is gonna throw him an outlet pass? Alex Len?   3) before 2016-2017, he had great rebounded next to him. He had KD who‚Äôd grab 7 and Ibaka who‚Äôd grab 7. Go look at this roster and try to find a player capable of averaging 7 rebounds.   If you don‚Äôt watch the Wizards or are knowledgeable about the roster, I would suggest that you refrain from commenting because it‚Äôs not a particularly good look to come off as ignorant."
Capela is 100% worth it and has proven this season to have separated himself from those similar type players. The difference from Alex Len and Damian Jones to Clint Capela is night and day and the biggest reason the Hawks started winning.
"well the implication was that Washington would try to help their own team, not pay to offload him lol  though now you mention OKC, maybe Horford for Bertans has some merit? They're both clear negative contracts and Washington's been trotting out Robin Lopez and Alex Len at C all year lol"
"It's kinda incredible how bad that Wizards roster is.   They surround Russ and Beal by starting Raul Neto and Alex Len.. Like why does Len even play when they have Robin Lopez and Daniel Gafford?   Ish Smith, who has played for 11 teams, was their best player off the bench.  Rui is okay but they could have had Herro, Thybulle, PJ Washington, or Brandon Clarke.  They drafted Deni Avdjia last year when they probably should have picked Haliburton since he fell.   I guess they're hoping Thomas Bryant and Deni come back.."
"1. Why did Len play? 2. Beal is clearly injured and did more bad than good. Let Tatum get going on him, forced up too many shots and killed the offense. 3. Why is Alex Len starting?  4. Why isn‚Äôt the big rotation only Lopez and Gafford? Clear going to lopez on the block or gafford on the roll or drop was the only play the celtics had trouble defending. 5. Scott Brooks secrit plays strike again. They need to fire him and try to hire Becky Hammon or one of the spurs/ raps assistant coaches"
"Alex Len only played 11 minutes, why ppl use him as a scapegoat?"
When i saw that Alex Len and Raul Neto were starting i knew it would end up in a disaster
Beal is playing on one leg and they're starting Alex Len at C. With Ish Smith and Raul Neto spacing the floor
Alex Len doesn't even belong on the team let alone on the floor
"Ish Smith was 6-8, Hachimura was 4-5, Gafford was 6-7.   Yet, the role-players who took the most shots were Alex Len (2-8) and Bertans (1-8). Alex Len somehow managed to take 8 shots in 12 minutes of play time.  Brooks needs to learn to make adjustments."
Alex Len is a zero on offense and a stiff defensively I don't understand how he's the starter
i would rather have 45 yr old tim duncan then alex len.
Scott Brooks is an embarrassment. There is no reason Alex Len should be on an NBA roster much less playing in a playoff game. I get Gafford was in foul trouble but can‚Äôt you roll with Lopez for a bit?
"Giving Alex Len minutes is a pretty big head scratcher. Gafford and Lopez are just better than him and in a very important game like this, you should really tighten up your rotations."
Imagine playing Alex Len above 3 minutes in a competitive game
I‚Äôm not sure whether I want the wizards to just put me out of my misery on Thursday because I don‚Äôt know if I want to watch Alex Len attempt to play defense on Joel Embiid for 4 games
Is there a reason why Alex Len was allowed to touch the floor today?
I'm offended that you think Alex Len deserves any rebounds on his box score
damn westbrook really tanked this team's lottery odds only to disappear in    the play-in. always has been a stat-padding fraud and always will be. nephews impressed with stealing rebounds from alex len will downvote.
Wizards fans on their way to blame Alex Len for Westbrook's shitty shot selection
Mo Wagner &gt; Alex Len
All my homies hate Alex Len
Brooks shouldn't have made a play for Alex fucking Len coming out of the first timeout. He really put his best foot forward on that one...
I don‚Äôt understand why Lopez isn‚Äôt being utilized especially over alex len...
Alex Len is tall.
So if the Wizards lose and get the 8 seed over the Pacers does Alex Len have to guard Embiid?
"Alex Len, that guys was the hawks center last year. One of the worst basketball players in the NBA."
I swear Alex Len is useless
TIL Alex Len is Ukrainian
Alex Len got cut from the lottery Raptors so why on earth does Scott Brooks think Alex Len is a plus player against a playoff side??
Alex Len is so bad.
Alex Len is a walking stiff.
Watching Alex Len pretend to play basketball is painful
Why is that bum Alex Len getting so many mins???
"If Scott Brooks want to keep his job, he better not play Alex Len anymore. How do you not box out on a defensive rebound?"
As a Maryland alum it pains me to say but Alex Len is straight trash
Alex Len needed that
That was good. Alex Len needs a smack to get his head in the game
Alex Len minutes got me lookin at this bleach different.
LMAO Alex Len got doubled smacked for good measure. I love Westbrook.
Alex len lmfao
"If Alex Len is getting buckets against you, you're gonna have a bad time"
Why alex len in the game
"Wow, Robin Lopez is way better than Alex Len. Who knew?"
That‚Äôs Phoenix suns legend Alex Len! SMH Also I just realized that he and robin lopez were both drafted by the suns.
I called it. Time Lord is so good man. Alex Len just a straight up bum.
Imagine having an athletic big who plays hard and saying nah Alex Len is better
"Seriously cannot believe Alex Len is considered starter material, especially in playoffs.I know Brooks is a complete doofus, but holy"
Alex Len really just be out there
"Just remember, the Wizards are doing this with Alex Len on their team"
I don‚Äôt get the idea Alex Len is a very good NBA player
Is there a bigger waste of height than Alex Len ?
Good to see Alex Len hasn't changed
Scott Brooks really has Alex Len starting over Lopez in such an important game??
Alex Len is such a bum bro
Not fair. Celtics have celtics and wiz got alex len for covid reasons just to fill the roster
Y'all starting Alex Len when Robin Lopez is right there smfh I need my damn FANTASY POINTS I PICKED LOPEZ
Still going with Alex Len as the starter huh
"Alex Len fucking sucks, sucked in Maryland too"
Raptors legend Alex Len draws first blood üòà
"Oh hey, that's where Alex Len wound up."
Alex Len would be the best center on Charlotte
How dare you speak so poorly of Alex len
"Suns only had 4 top-5 picks over the last decade.  2013: Alex Len (5) 2016: Dragan Bender (4) 2017: Josh Jackson (4) 2018: Deandre Ayton (1)  The Suns have actually had a lot more draft hits in the back half of the lottery than the front half: Booker (13), Bridges (10), Cam Johnson (12), and even TJ Warren (14)."
I was pretty sold on Alex Len. :/
"Arguably no team drafted worse than Phoenix in the past 10 years. Alex Len, Dragan Bender and Marquisse Chriss were all Top 5 selections by the Suns. They just made terrible talent evaluation decisions over and over again. A bunch of big men who don't play defense and are fringe fits with the modern NBA.  I'm happy they finally have a good core with Booker, Bridges and Ayton but this was a delayed rebuild that could have happened a lot faster with more intelligent decision making in the lottery."
Sometimes centers can‚Äôt catch the hall when they can get a east bucket after a pass from their point guard. Take Alex Len for example. Russ (and past point guard teammates) are handing it off for a relatively easy shot and he can‚Äôt catch it so it screws up that great opportunity
Alex Len prevented Trae from averaging 10 assist.
I mean Russ had Alex Len as his starting center and Ish Smith as his backup PG
People forget that you all waived Alex Len because he was so bad - the Raptors need a center but they need a serviceable one first and foremost.
it's not Alex Len?
His performance just last week against the hawks proves the wizards win in spite of him. Who tf plays ish Smith and Alex Len over Rui hachimora and Gafford for the final 8 minutes of a game when they‚Äôre both playing like trash?
spoken like a man who hasn't seen alex len try to rebound lol
Alex Len is the worst defender ive seen
It‚Äôs kinda funny to imagine Beal sending an email begging Scott not to play Alex Len anymore
"Yes. He has the worst rotations of any coach. Beal has been out with injury and in the last game vs the Hawks Brooks pulled Rui Hachimura (the 3rd best player on the team) for the final 6 minutes while the team gave up a 19-9 run. He also refused to play our best center, Daniel Gafford, in favor of playing Alex Len during that run. (and that's a regular thing)  He doesn't coach an offense, and his defense only got better after we added Daniel Gafford (who again, he refuses to play regular minutes). He doesn't hold players like Russ accountable, but he'll bench a guy for multiple games in a row if he thinks he fouled too much or something. (Garrison Matthews needs more playing time, especially without Beal)"
And they were shit fouls. AND they were treating Alex Len like he's the damn MVP candidate.
"dude, your posts are always cool. Scott Brooks has to fucking go. He isn't making any changes. At best, he'd start Alex Len at the SG."
Wizard fans cries tears of joy as they won't need to deal with Alex Len fumbling the ball anymore
"What the hell, I didn't even recognize him at first. I was like 'when did the Hawks bring in Alex Len or Marcin Gortat or whoever that is'"
Playing Alex Len 0 minutes a game would instantly make them more competitive. Lopez and Gafford is a good center rotation.
"There is no worse team than one that gives heavy minutes to Evan Turner (out of the league), Vince Carter (retired), Allen Crabbe (out of the league), Damian Jones (3 teams in one season), and Alex Len (3 teams in one season)."
you dont like Alex Len being the focal point of the offense in the first 5 mintutes?
"Imagine trying to double Booker when hes been double/tripled team since his rookie year due to being teamed with bums like Alex Len, Dragon Bender, and too many to list."
"Hawks fan here, Alex Len is not pretty good in the slightest. The fact that Westbrook and Beal drug a team w him as the starting center to the 8th seed is a massive W. Wiz would be so much better if Bryant didn‚Äôt get hurt"
I watched Alex Len at the line today and god damn it was embarassing
"Alex Len is pretty good. He does most things passably. He can hang. He just doesn‚Äôt make the big play. Gafford makes the big play, but he doesn‚Äôt consistently do the things required by starting centers. Look back at his time in Chicago. It‚Äôs the same way that guys like Jordan Clarkson or even at times KCP have been great, elite 6th men that you don‚Äôt wanna start because they‚Äôre not going to properly run your offense. It‚Äôs the big man version of that."
amazing that it wasn't alex len but drummond found a way
Alex Len or Drummond?  Tony Bradley or Drummond?  Dwight Howard (lol) or Drummond?
"Who would you rather have on your team, Andre Drummond or Alex Len"
Alex Len....oh Myers Leonard
If they get a HC that doesn‚Äôt decided to start Alex Len they‚Äôll likely turn it around next season
And yet Alex Len played 50% more minutes...
Alex Len
Can Alex Len guard Perk right now?
"That doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense, if he‚Äôs their best center he needs to start. Maybe you‚Äôre right about his role but who gives a fuck when your current starter is Alex Len"
"someone said on a game thread before that Alex Len this season is Scott Brooks' Kendrick Perkins, which is probably the best way to describe it lol"
"oh wow Embiid could overcome Alex Len and Robin Lopez, guess he is better than Kareem now"
"Wow, he played well against Daniel Gafford and Alex Len. Truly the stuff of legend"
He lays bricks and turns the ball over but at least he takes rebounds from Alex Len
This would be terrible for the game lol. You want the highest quality players on the court more not less. No one wants to watch the Alex Len show
Alex Len is -16  Daniel Gafford is +25  Why does Len START??
‚ÄúIs Alex Len better than Embiid?‚Äù
no alex len hating today
Even? The best player in the NBA was taken out of the game with awful calls in the first half. How is it even because Alex Len also got 1 or 2 fouls?
I say Alex Len
Alex Len is getting the superstar treatment and is unguardable per the refs. Embiid with 2 fouls in like 6 minutes and then 1 more four minutes into the second.  Also known as refs suck
Alex Len and Bertans of all people
everyone predicted that Alex Len would get Embiid into early foul trouble
we‚Äôre playing 5 on 8. The refs are treating alex len like a superstar
Terrible foul calls to the soon to be finals MVP Alex Len
Alex Len out here getting superstar calls
alex len getting superstar calls today
Apparently all the calls go to superstar Alex Len.
Thanks refs I was really looking forward to watching Embiid in the playoffs but you bums have been giving Alex Len of all people the superstar treatment game 1 so far.
"Yeah, there‚Äôs an international big man dominating this series as we expected, Alex Len."
Why are the Sixers getting destroyed by Alex Len of all people? üòÇ
The Tobias Harris vs Alex Len game we all expected
Alex Len
Alex Len the face of the league we didn‚Äôt know we needed and we definitely don‚Äôt deserve
Alex Len.
Alex Len next Hakeem ?
Alex Len game
Alex ‚ÄúHarden‚Äù Len
Alex Len is confusing
Alex Len getting a superstar whistle right now lol
Just got out of prison after 23 yrs. Is Alex Len the greatest since Shaq?
Alex Len = God
Alex Len has been the Wizards best player. Playoff Westbrick is holding them back
Congrats to Alex Len on becoming the new Joel Embiid
Alex Len has drawn 3 or 4 fouls just from being uncoordinated
ALEX LEN WITH THE 2.25 POINT PLAY
"James Harden, Jimmy Butler, Alex Len. Elite at drawing free throws"
Prime dwight  would never. Alex len? Bruh
Why is Alex Len getting superstar calls this is insane
Alex Len out here playing like the high draft pick he was. Ages ago
Alex Len just turned into prime Lebron. Scott Brooks proved us wrong the entire season
why tf are the refs treating alex len like prime shaq
Why is Alex Len getting a superstar whistle? Lmfao
How are they still letting Alex Len on the court holy fuck      These calls ain't helping stop letting this clown shoot FTs
What the fuck lmao. the Alex Len game
Yeah that‚Äôs Alex Len alright
Man Alex Len blows and wtf was that foul on Embiid for? Garbage call.
Alex Len is so bad Jesus
Alex Len is so SHIT
How does Alex Len constantly find staring jobs lol
omg Ben Simmons &gt; Alex Len at free throws
I fucking HATE Alex Len
Alex Len a god damn bum
"The Wizards are oddly well equipped to line up a Shaq like foul rotation among their centers.   * Robin Lopez: 3 fouls, 3 minutes * Alex Len: 2 fouls, 7 minutes * Daniel Gafford: 2 fouls, 4 minutes"
"If we lose a game where ish smith, Raul Neto, and Alex Len are getting playoff minutes imma be pissed"
"robin lopez, alex len and dan gafford... all guys on 2k that i fill my roster with.   eeek"
If I was Scott Brooks I would simply not play Alex Len and then have a much better chance at winning basketball games
Alex Len
Why the fuck is Alex Len still in this 7 minutes into the first quarter. You‚Äôre killing me BrooksüôÉüòî
"When your rotation includes Alex Len and Raul Neto, your best wing defender is chandler hutchison, and you often run three guard lineups versus the biggest team in the league, you‚Äôre probably gonna lose every game"
Alex Len is going to lose them this game by himself
Alex Len being in this game reminds me of when chuck took shaqs minute in that one clip of Shaq getting butthurt lmao
"*technically* alex len is holding embiid to 1-4 shooting, DPOY?"
man imagine thinking that you're going to lose this series b/c of Alex Len is jacking up every shot
Alex Len hit the weight room pussy
"am i tripping or did marv albert just say ""joel embiid played by danny green"", while joel embiid was posting up alex len. lol"
‚ÄúLooks like Shaq in ‚Äò01 against Dikembe‚Äù is something no human should say when Joel Embiid backs down Alex Len
"I forgot this game was on this early did anything remarkable happen yet other than the Wizards, in the fucking playoffs, still STARTING ALEX FUCKING LEN????"
Alex Len Bro just stop
Alex Len shouldnt be playing minutes and certainly not getting looks.
the wizards gotta get daniel gafford in. joel is gonna kill alex len
I don‚Äôt get how people can watch russ play and think he‚Äôs selfish. A majority of the time he feeds these fuckers they just do dumb shit. Alex Len needs to be benched
Alex Len cookin early
alex len gonna win this series
Alex Len game !
Alex Len lol
If alex len score a point then the wiz will win. Guaranteed.
Alex Len really starting üò≠ üò≠
lol wizards are starting Alex Len against Embiid.....
They really starting Alex Len against Embiid... Jesus Christ
is scott brooks still starting alex len?
Hurr during I'm going to throw Alex len at Joel Embiid because I'm incompetent hurr durr
Are you arguing that Alex Len might not be able to handle Embiid?  I‚Äôm seen some crazy tales on here but...
They start Alex Len btw
&gt; this game he was in foul trouble so he didn‚Äôt get to get into rhythm nearly as much as Tillman  This has become a trend for him though. He has lead the league in fouls per game both his rookie and sophomore year. People point to Draymond and Gobert who fouled a lot but got better but Jaren fouled even worse than them and didn't improve at all from year 1 to year 2. For every Draymond and Gobert there is an Alex Len and Hasheem Thabeet who also foul at a super high rate and don't improve at it their whole career.  He is still super young but it should be a little bit concerning and something to keep an eye on these next couple years.
Alex Len is barely a center
"I remember being happy they signed Baynes. Was solid in Boston. Was starting to drain 3s in Phoenix. Age didn't matter to me because he was never athletic to begin with.  How the hell, is he that bad. I was actually blown away. (Same goes for Alex Len too)"
"Bro don‚Äôt you fucking dare mention Zaza‚Äôs name like that, we don‚Äôt need Alex Len to hurt anybody. Fuck Zaza!"
Alex Len snubbed
"yea it's all fun and games until Lopez fouls out, Gafford is at 5 fouls and gassed, and Alex Len is trying to defend Embiid on the perimeter while he's hitting stepback threes and fade aways from the midrange..."
"When people make the argument that centers can be had for cheap, they're talking about Alex Len. That's his ceiling unfortunately.  Remember though that Alex Len was so ass that the Raptors, who have struggled so bad at the 5 for most of the season, waived him."
Turns out Alex Len isn‚Äôt the ideal defensive matchup for Embiid lol
"I can understand why, in general, a coach would be reluctant to just hand over starter minutes to a guy who was a throwaway piece in a trade a couple months ago...but the guys Gafford are competing with are Robin Lopez (solid but unspectacular vet) and Alex Len (certifiable scrub).  Gafford was awesome last night and he should be on the floor 30 minutes, especially when Westbrook is on the court and can toss him lobs.  I don't know what is keeping Brooks from realizing this."
"Some team may give him a chance.  Maybe it has to do more with the Raptors than with Baynes.  Alex Len, who the Raptors waived earlier in the season, is actually putting up decent numbers with the Wizards."
Robin Lopez should be starting and Alex Len should be left in a locker
Embiid sees Alex Len in his nightmares
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. ‚Äî Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn‚Äôs Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown‚Äôs defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. ‚Äî Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we‚Äôve created. ‚Äî James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox‚Äôs ability to put pressure on the rim ‚Äî as well as finish when he gets there ‚Äî would open up more room for Miami‚Äôs shooters. ‚Äî Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he‚Äôs inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. ‚Äî Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard ‚Äî it‚Äôs their greatest position of need ‚Äî and Lowry is the best available. He‚Äôd slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton‚Äôs minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn‚Äôt long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. ‚Äî Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I‚Äôm just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn‚Äôt have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He‚Äôll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That‚Äôs fierce. ‚Äî Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he‚Äôd fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. ‚Äî Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? ‚Äî Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet‚Äôs efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he‚Äôs still a bad man. He‚Äôd fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they‚Äôd be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. ‚Äî Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who‚Äôs their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. ‚Äî Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray‚Äôs absence somehow and although Rozier isn‚Äôt the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that‚Äôll play alongside Nikola Jokic. ‚Äî Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don‚Äôt really have weaknesses, so it‚Äôd be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. ‚Äî Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that‚Äôs what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  ‚Äî Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns‚Äô biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there‚Äôs no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. ‚Äî Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I‚Äôm not sure, which is why I‚Äôm bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I‚Äôm going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
Alex len robin lopez and daniel gafford will attempt to stop embiid sixers in 5 lol
"No. Gafford is going to be in foul trouble for the entire series and Alex Len is basically made of Porcelain.   It's too difficult to win games in a series ""Outside-in"" when you're getting beaten inside on a nightly basis. Wiz could take a game, if the stars align maybe it goes 6, but I would wager on the consistency of Philly's game over.the shooting of Washington."
Obviously the answer is Alex len
"So you wanna see Alex Len be dirty against one of the more injury prone guys in the league, in 1-8 series. Ok bro"
Alex Len should be in 3rd at the Center rotation behind Robin Lopez but you know just Scott Brooks things
Alex Len revenge game coming
Alex Len is going to be in a playoff game before Devin Booker (by 2.5 hours). Really proves how great a pick Len was by McDonough!
Especially when one of those bodies is Alex Len
alex len is going to dominate ayton in the finals
Alex Len is lucky to be in the league
LOL he called Anthony Gill Alex Len
"And called Anthony Gill,  Alex Len.  Which is even worse"
alex len will son embiid and redeem his career
"Agreed. Even in a winning game he's still making bad decisions (Alex Len, really??)"
Any center not named alex len
"Come to think about it, maybe Scott Brooks should *actually* play Alex Len the entire 2nd half and let Gafford get some rest for Embiid lol"
Alex Len vs Jojo the matchup we all needed
What is this Alex Len holding his own on defense that I'm seeing?
Hope your ready for him to go back to the bench in the 2nd half so Brooks can make sure Alex Len gets his minutes.
Somebody on Twitter said Alex Len is Scott Brooks‚Äô new Kendrick Perkins and I don‚Äôt anyone could‚Äôve put it more perfectly
Gafford with more court time than Robin Lopez and Alex Len combined so far. All is right in Oz.
Remember guys Brooks starts Alex Len over Gafford
Yeah Alex Len should probably never see the floor again for the Wiz
Alex Len should never start over Gafford
Does alex len start so the wizards can go down 15?
Wizards 16 nothing run coincides with Lopez being on court? WHY IS ALEX LEN GETTING ANY MINUTES
I see Brooks doesn't make adjustments and still is playing useless Alex Len instead of going with Lopez.
" yayy marv albert     Wizards by 6, it'd be more if they STOPPED STARTING ALEX FUCKING LEN"
I know but something about that comment was just TOO reckless. I just watched Alex Len play for the Wizards
"Alex Len and Damian Jones are crap though. Can't just put anyone tall in there, scouting department still needs to be able to find the lobs and blocks bargain, but they are out there."
