"&gt; Oubre's expiring contract may not be their biggest problem.  No, it's probably spending 120 million dollars on three years of 30-something Klay Thompson after missing two straight seasons with devastating lower body injuries.  Remember, Klay's rep as a defender has been infinitely better than any stat has seen him as a defender for years. Now you've got shitty mobility mixed in.   It is very likely that, over the course of a contract paying him about 190 million dollars, he provides league-average or lower play, and plays about half the games.  It might be the worst contract in NBA history."
Sheesh ... imagine if they had a guy like Klay Thompson or something
"if Klay thompson played in game 3, he would added atleast 19 points to curry’s 47. which would have them a fighting chance."
"&gt; PG is getting more than one free throw attempt in any given game   I'm not so sure about that, dude isn't that effective any more as a driver, he's become much more like Klay Thompson.   &gt; Oh, and would everyone stop trying to post up James Harden? I get that you are supposed to attack him on defense but not there. That's the one spot he can actually defend.  Kawhi is honestly not the right type of player to attack Harden. Harden's weakness is speed, and Kawhi doesn't really have that. And we saw that Kawhi couldn't move Harden.   TBH it was kind of surprising how the Clippers didn't try any Lou Will/Kawhi actions to force Kyrie onto Kawhi and attack him on defense."
Klay Thompson?
Klay Thompson

Hot Klay Thompson is the greatest basketball player of all time.
"Yeah, you’d think a company like Tissot with them being an official sponsor of the NBA would wanna sign someone like Dame. instead they have like Klay Thompson, and few others I can’t remember. I guess you could say Klay is equally deserving of a watch company endorsement if they were trying to sign him for the 4:20 memes lol"

Imagine spending money for buying klay thompson shoes
"I really hope this was just because NYK were on a back to back. The next game will go to show.  I thought the Bulls played really well, they clearly understood the correct defensive scheme to play against us. I honestly did not expect the Bulls defense to be this good, even given how shitty our offensive personnel is, but Young and Temple can really bring it on that end apparently.  Randle letting Markkanen go off is a bad sign, perimeter defense is just as important as iso defense. However, I don't know what you can do against a catch and shoot guy like that. I could see him being a Klay Thompson type player given his tools, although Randle bullied him on defense as well.  Ultimately the Knicks need to hit shots to win these games, and they need to win these games to make the playoffs. 20% from 3 is atrocious. If that picks up next game I expect to see a different result, but if Bulls are smart they'll force us to shoot above the break or just let Payton and Barrett take the shots. The only way we win the next game with just defense is if we can stop Markkanen... I think we have the personnel to contain Lavine. It will be up to Randle to close out on him better.  Also, refs did NYK a lot of favors last night, even though we only shot 6 extra free throws."
"From up to 15-17 feet and from that side angle it's an extremely easy and reproduceable shot. Obviously it's still possible to bank shots in from farther than that and from other angles but it becomes much harder/less consistent.  As for why more players don't use it's cause for mid to long 2s and considering the caliber of shooters NBA players are it's already easy enough to just swish it consistently without the backboard, and the bank is also only open from certain angles and distances. From closer ranges like 7 to 15 feet most elite scoring guards and wings like Devin Booker or Klay Thompson etc know how to use the backboard for buckets whether 2 handed or 1 handed scoop, turnarounds, fades, don't matter. They just don't use glass for the deeper 15-23 foot midrange jumpers like Westbrook or Duncan cause they don't need to a regular jumper is still like a layup from that range.  There's also another type of shot that you don't see a lot in the NBA which is like driving the same angle as a layup and using the same footwork and technique but just releasing the ball from farther away from the basket like a hook or one legged runner. Probably cause the nba is full of crazy tall, crazy long, guys who are crazy fast and bouncy and would volleyball those shots into the stands. But you see it in youth basketball my old teammate was a pg who was good at it and Xavier Simpson at Michigan was a master at that shot."
You klay simps are embarrassing. Klay Thompson is an asshole and an overrated player. Simp him harder. The guy is going to suck next year. His time is done.
"I couldn’t give less of a shit. I care as much about you being my friend as I do about klay Thompson tearing his Achilles. That is to say, zero."
"Fuck klay Thompson. Guy is a fucking asshole, and always has been, but piece of shit warriors fans have been defending him for years and see no problem with him punching down and saying Rodney will be out of the league soon. He‘s also massively overrated, and wouldn’t be looked at anywhere nearly as positively if he didn’t have the good fortune to play with steph. Enjoy paying all that money for klay to sit on the bench and say stupid shit on the warriors broadcast."
"If you were Steph Curry, would you:  A. Pass it to Kevin Durant, a career 38% 3pt shooter  B. Pass it to Klay Thompson, a career 42% 3pt shooter  Or   C. Pass it to Draymond, a career 32% shooter"
"people said the same thing about KD. people said the same thing about John Wall.  you are delusional if you think a fucking 34 year old *GLEN DAVIS* is better than Klay Thompson, even if he's at 50%."
how about klay thompson and steph curry?
"Lots of #2 guys are on max contracts. Klay Thompson, Khris Middleton, CJ McCollum..."
Fuck Klay Thompson
"Did Klay Thompson-Steph Curry work? Did Steph walk when Klay joined the Dubs? Did Steph AND Klay ask to be traded when KD signed with the team? Great teams know how to distribute the ball, and great players know how to make it work. For Book to say he wanted Ayton instead of Luka isn’t a sign Book is a great player, AllNBA player, imo."
"My point was that Klay is a great player, but how great is up for legitimate questioning in my mind.   Saying, “Steph creates great opportunities for teammates, but it’s up to teammates to hit shots,” is like saying, “Money doesn’t buy happiness.” Yes, it’s literally true, but money puts you in a much better position to achieve happiness. Similarly, will Kelly Oubre suddenly become an all-time great shooter playing with Steph? No. But could somebody like Duncan Robinson? Ray Allen? Absolutely.  My point has always been the same. Klay is tremendously talented in a very specific way. If he was the first option on a team like Charlotte, or New York, do you see that team making the playoffs? You can argue that Klay is smart for being focused on what’s best for the team, for sticking with a contender as a second option rather than being first option on a lottery team, etc. Those are all valid arguments to make, but not really the topic of discussion. My point is that I think if he weren’t the beneficiary of the player who literally changed the way basketball is played, Klay Thompson would have a very different (and worse) career."
"&gt; Do fans want trash talk, or not? &gt;  &gt; I'm very confused right now.  Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are the bully fake-popular kids with the megaphones. McGruder is an under-the-radar hustle player who has managed to carve out roles on some quality teams in his career so far."
"&gt; Was it funny as hell and true? sure  Definitely not funny, or true. I don't even understand what you're saying. McGruder is a quality player who has been a rotation player on some good teams in his short NBA career, and has had to work hard to prove himself. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are the bully popular kids with the megaphones. McGruder is an under-the-radar hustle player type."
Bet if Harden or Paul George said this shit you and all the other GSW fans would be singing a different tune but because it's /r/nba golden boy Klay Thompson it's a completely different attitude.
"&gt;halloween cookies  Writing “RIP Steph Curry and Klay Thompson” on cookies is a pretty valid reason to be upset. That’s an extremely weird and gross thing to do. Random trash talk during a game, not so much."
Are we sure that isn’t Klay Thompson out there?
"&gt;Klay isn't the type to talk shit for no reason  Klay is constantly talking shit, and then whining when anyone talks shit back.

That's only two more than Klay Thompson made by himself in his 37 point quarter.
"Yeah it's kind of annoying that our biggest weaknesses this year are 3pt shooting and rebounding, and our two season ending injuries are to Klay Thompson and to arguably our best rebounder in Chriss."
3 pointers (that you aren't even allowed to properly defend anymore because of the Klay Thompson incident) make scoring so much easier.
"I’ve been saying klay Thompson wasn’t classy for a long time now, but he’s this subs golden boy so not many think that."
"the answer to this is that they shouldn't have put klay thompson, known asshole, on a mic lmao."
"When steph outperform harden with no KD? You mean that 2018 series where harden averaged 35/7/7 on 60% TS? Steph outperformed him? Or we talking about the game where Steph had 0 in a half and was still in the game because Klay Thompson went nuclear. Don’t get me wrong Steph had a fantastic game, but you switch and have harden score 0 in a half and the rockets are blown out, not still in the game until harden decides he wants to explode."
"It's not generational or a modern thing. Individual accolades a lot of times go to superstars. Dame Lillard is a superstar over Klay. So is Paul George. No one would've called Klay a superstar back in the day. You're probably in the vast minority of people that have definition of a superstar in which Klay Thompson fits. You think you know what a superstar is, but you actually just don't know. Who's been as good a two way player as Klay? What does that have to do with him being a superstar? I'm genuinely confused as to what you think a superstar is."
This back and forth was hilarious to read. Someone thinking Klay Thompson qualifies as a superstar is a first for me. You should make a post about it and see how many people agree with you. Then you two can settle the debate.
"Klay Thompson isn't funny or very interesting, just a guy who always had the easier defender then steph and can't really dribble or make plays. Plays some solid D tho"
Klay “it’s man’s league” Thompson is simply horrible with words
"Ok, you're either Klay Thompson or you wanna suck his dick. Which one?"
Who would win in a (Twitter) fight? Clay Thompson or Klay Travis
What’s your point? That klay Thompson is better than Kelly oubre? Have you called the sports media to inform them of this? The Wiggins thing supports my point. He’s shooting a career best from 3 because of how often steph is doubled.
"Danny Green's foul on Klay Thompson put him out for a year and it wasn't remotely dirty.  TJ Ford's career was nearly ended twice by non-dirty fouls (Mark Madsen and Al Horford).  What Lowry did was reckless, but the hate boner this sub has for him is absolutely ridiculous."
The Klay hate in here is honestly news to me lol. Who tf hates Klay Thompson? This thread is full of *he can’t keep getting away with this!!!!!* like he’s been Patrick Beverly in disguise his whole career.
Klay Thompson straight comedy love him
Steph gets hate because he’s better. People hate steph for beating their team. Klay Thompson isn’t beating anyone by himself.
"[he's actually quoted as being against recreational use](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/klay-thompson-no-recreational-marijuana/), dude's always been a narc bitch"
Mychal and Klay Thompson deserve at least an honorable mention here. Mychal was a former #1 overall pick and was a very good starting center on Portland before he became a role player for the showtime Lakers.
Klay Thompson is biggest douchebag out of the bunch. Mychal Thompson always had this stuck up better than people personality and the apple doesn't seem to have fallen far from the tree.
"True story: my buddy’s wife worked as a cart girl at a course in Washington. She had no idea who klay Thompson was.   Somehow it was found out that they brought beer with them on the course. She told him they wouldn’t be able to drink their own beer and they could buy some from the cart she was on and they would give theirs back at the end of the round. Apparently he did the whole “do you know who I am?” Bit. I’m pretty sure it was after their 2nd chip, she said “nope.” And proceeded to confiscate all of their bud light limes.  They bought beer from the cart and didn’t tip her at all 😂."
"Lmao, did you just fabricate the entire comment to protect Klay Thompson 😐😐  **The real situation:**   **Draymond** was playing dirty and calling LBJ names in the middle of the Game.  Klay Thompson at a post-game conference stated that saying the NBA is a ""man's league"".  But, back in Klay's G3 post-game he was complaining to the media about how he thought Timofey Mozgov setting a screen in front of the key was ""dirty"".  The irony of this is that he'll complain about a regular screen albeit weirdly placed, but then effectively call LBJ soft for not putting up with Draymond's bullshit.  &gt;How many games has lebron just fled to the locker room after losing (note he's done it multiple times)  To my recollection, never have I seen LBJ do so in the finals except in 2018 game 4."
"&gt;Bro has anybody in league history ever fallen off harder than the Warriors dynasty?  Yes wtf. Dear god, yes. This question is shocking to me honestly lmao. Do people around here not know basketball history?   Like, you've heard of the Chicago Bulls yeah? Led by MJ? After he left, they were last in their division for four years, averaging a win rate of .227.  The fact the Warriors lost a top 5 player in the league and managed to snag a very solid key player in Wiggins along with a solid bench and keep performing middle of the pack is pretty impressive all things considered. And this is without Klay Thompson. Not to mention a number two overall pick up and potential for lottery pick next year if not then year after. The Warriors are not in some awful place, even though they aren't currently contenting.   Sure, the fall from 2019 to 2020 was massive. But we all know what happened, the two superstars of the team were injured. It's not like the Warriors have entered into some lottery build with no reason to watch. They still have Stephen Curry, who's averaging 28 5 and 6, and who's shooting % are rising each game. They've made huge comebacks against two of the top teams in the league. They're not bottom of barrel trash despite inconsistencies.   Surprisingly, we could be in much worse of a position after KD's departure. This is not a bad place to be at the end of a dynasty."
"We don't need another point guard, especially one who will play no defense and likes to dribble the air out of the ball.  What we need is Klay Thompson who'll be back next year."

Joe Harris really is a bootleg Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson
"As someone who is actually a decent 3pt shooter you can learn to shoot threes in like a month. You don’t even need to care about form or mechanics or anything.   Just go out there and chuck like 50-100 threes every day and have fun. At some point you will get the feel for it and after a month you can shoot like 4/10, 5/10 from 3 if you are unguarded.   It doesn’t matter if you are Shawn Marioning it or trying to have Klay Thompson perfect form, you just need to shoot to get better.   Since I am from Europe I never ever played baseball, but I think that hitting a fast ball is sure as hell harder than shooting 3s."
"I’m sorry but I’ve never heard another man as egotistical and full of himself than Klay Thompson.  Some people might find it funny.  I find it cringe and annoying.  Constantly propping himself up, saying how great he is at broadcasting and every sport known to man.  I was a fan before he showed his true dark side in this one."
Klay Thompson is the epitome of classless.  He showed his ass in those 12 minutes
How To with Klay Thompson

"FreeDawkins has Klay's ""full game"" reporting highlights up already  [enjoy](https://www.freedawkins.com/klay-thompson-20210131/)"
"It's a hard argument to make Klay Thompson the 2nd best shooter.  I think if he had played most of his career with an assist oriented point guard and without Curry on his team, he probably would be averaging more shots per game overall, although I'm not sure how much more he'd get as the Warriors offense definitely rewards movement and back screens better than most others because of the great distribution.      I would put Nowitzki above Thompson for example because his mid-range game was probably the best in history(between 10-23) although his three point percentage is just 38% - although for his playing time that is very good number, just not all time great.  I think if someone had just told him earlier in his career to take more threes than two, his numbers would be even better as he was really a beast from just inside the line, and no one really blocked his shot consistently with his volume.  But, volume-wise and for almost his whole long career, Nowitzki was a sniper.  Klay has gotten screwed with these back to back injuries during his prime, so he'll probably never pile up numbers like Allen, Nowitzki, Miller, Curry or even guys like Lilliard from all spots.  Also, Klay's numbers from 3-10 feet aren't great either while some of these greats shot 40%+ from every distance which for me is pretty amazing and consistent.      You should check out r/nbadiscussion as they do like to delve into this subject a bunch more and look at different types of shooting prowess [like this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/ky8388/steph_curry_off_the_dribble_some_context/)."

Kings fans always lament that we could have had Klay Thompson or Kawhi Leonard, but the truth is there is a high likelihood their development would have been stunted by Keith fucking Smart and the rest of the trash coaches we've had the past couple of years.   This is the same as the corporate world; good managers and leaders are the most valuable commodity of any company. If you find an org that maximizes your skills and you're able to grow into something better long-term, you stick with that."
Simple fix just keep shooting till you become a Walmart Klay Thompson
"Nah, not really. Bc of 2 reasons. 1) Kyrie and harden are redundant. 2) Harden doesn’t move without the ball.   So Kyrie and KD is great. Harden and Kyrie is great. KD and harden is great.   But when you put all 3 together, it’s not like you just multiply their scoring and they’re as goos as the sum of their parts. There’s a point of diminishing returns. Someone’s gonna get phased out every night, bc their isn’t any differing styles or elite off ball players, ie Klay Thompson was a perfect 3rd option.  All 3 of them together isn’t that much better , if at all, than 2 of them together with a supporting cast and depth."

So he still had an all world Klay Thompson and soon to be finals MVP Iguodala. Wow that must have been so hard winning with those players.   Green can prove me wrong this year by dominating with only a former MVP in Curry. But if last night is any indication that's too much to ask.

"Yeah and one day you will learn that playing with the two greatest shooters of all time made his life 1000 times easier than Kobe who played with 57 year old Steve Nash and injuried Dwight Howard.  Imagine actually ignoring that Steph UNDERPERFORMING still puts up 24 ppg while Kobe's second best player in 2013 shot under 50% from the FREE THROW LINE.  KD had it easier, plain and simple. Put 2013 Kobe in that Warriors squad and they win the championship with record numbers. Imagine not being able to double Kobe freaking Bryant every possession because he plays with Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, that's what KD had."
"&gt;Steph AVERAGED 25-7-5 on 71% TS in that series, 71%  cute  kd started slow and then averaged 41.5 PPG through games 3 to 6. they lost one of those games by 8 when KD put up 45 with a 72% TS%.  &gt;Steph underperformed so much that when KD went down he carried Golden State to back to back wins and a 4-2 victory.  using a one half sample size. yikes. that's embarassing. KD averaged 33.2 PPG, steph put up 23.8 PPG on below league avg efficiency. there's really no discussion about it. if that's not underperforming then you have very low standards for steph, which is saying something. he was the 3rd best player in the series. pretty simple.  &gt;KD was the best player on a team that without him still went to the Finals and was a Klay Thompson injury away from beating the Raptors  yes of course the warriors were a great team. good job  &gt;to act like there was no comparison between his 2019 version and Kobe in 2013, it is laughable  there just isnt. lol. kobe had a great season.

AFAIK they still have the Klay [$9.3m trade exception.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-granted-9-3-million-disabled-player-exception-after-injury-to-klay-thompson-per-report/) Not completely sure how that works but could they possibly use that exception towards Oladipo's contract so they would *only* need $11m?
Klay Thompson has a smooth shooting stance.
"Most of what you have to say has to do with Ball Handling as opposed to shooting. Klay wouldn't move around the doubles screens as well as Dame, or get the separation he does, but when it comes to shooting he would still be great. Klay has such a perfect, high release form, that hands in his face rarely bother him as well.   Im also talking about right now, which is why i did not mention anything about dame prior. Klay Thompson has been doing the same shit every season, so his career 3 point percentage is indicative of his play. Klay was at 44% on 7 attempts per game in 2018. Dame this year was at 38% on 11 attempts per game.   Also, Klay Thompson maintains his shooting efficiency in the playoffs which dame traditionally has not. But we'll look at their last two playoffs since that's when Dame became the elite shooter. 3.6 makes at 37.7% for Dame versus 3.3 makes at 43.5% for Klay."
"&gt; Like I think there's a very real argument to be made that Dame, cj, and Kyrie are all better shooters than Klay. They have a massive edge in off the dribble shooting and only a minor drop off in spot up shooting.      There is literally no argument that any of them are better shooters than Thompson."
Wood's career trajectory would deserve a 30 for 30 if he went from untouchable locker room cancer to prospect worth trading Klay Thompson away from the bay for
Klay Thompson because he's a national treasure. But seriously Sabonis because his smile so infectious.
"What percentage of Ray/Reggie is Klay Thompson? We've never seen Klay lead a team on his own, but imagine the warriors decide that Curry's ankles werent worth it and dealt him instead of Monta. Cut forward a few years and Monta has fallen off the face of the earth and you got Klaymond Warriors."
I will die on the hill that draymond is more important than Klay Thompson in any season since 2015.
Klay Thompson the better shooter. 60 point game with 11 dribbles
"You just brought me back to the Klay Thompson trade rumors. That whole offseason was honestly incredible, I was in 8th grade at the time I think but remember it totally got me into nba free agency."
"Yeah damm shame warriors front office, couldn’t pair him up with another amazing shooter. All they could get is that bum Klay Thompson dude"
Imagine Steph driving and kicking out to Klay Thompson for the catch and shoot
"Worldwide, Klay Thompson is a bigger star than Kevin Love"
"Idk why, but I’m missing Klay Thompson a lot this season"
The only people who don’t watch the games are people who think Klay Thompson is an elite defender lol
"Reminder, this guy played on the same team as Kevin Durant.  ...and Klay Thompson."
"Klay Thompson went 9-for-9 from 3-Point range in a single quarter, the Warriors won the game, Klay scored the most points for the Warriors in the win, and the Warriors went on to win the NBA championship that year.  The above confluence of events is still etched in my memory as to being my favourite NBA (and maybe all of sports) moment. That 2014-2015 Dubs season was magical."
http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/klay-thompson-of-the-golden-state-warriors-poses-for-a-portrait-with-picture-id477393980
"Curry's second MVP was a no brainer. The team won 73 games and Curry broke the NBA record for threes by 116, and second in the league was Klay with 126 fewer. The gap between Curry and Klay was the same as Klay and...Hollis Thompson.   And he did that shooting 50/45/91."
Yeah so if Wayne Ellington could not sink 8 3s and if Rodney McGruder could be who Klay Thompson thinks he is that’d be great. We’re trying to lose around here.
"He isn't even top ten man. Jordan, Kobe, Wade , drexler, Iverson, ray allen, jerry west, reggie miller, t-mac , early the pearl, shit even klay thompson. That's not a set order but they've all accomplished more. There's prolly more than that list too , that's just off the top of my head. Hes top five scorers maaayyybe, but there's no way he's top five in general."
have you heard of this guy named Klay Thompson
"Dude, are you dense? No one knew how good they would be until after the fact. You are obviously looking at their career in hindsight. Pippen was garbage when he was DRAFTED and got better. Phil Jackson was an UNKNOWN coach with 0 rings. Jesus.  A superteam is an ALREADY KNOWN super star like Lebron James joining a super star like Dwayne Wade and all star like Chris Bosh by signing with Miami. A superteam is superstar Kevin fucking Durant joining the 73-9 GSW with Unanimous MVP Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. This isn't Rocket science."
Klay thompson is in it thooo
More of going for the Joe Harris/ Klay Thompson comparison but ok...
This mans really said Tobi on Kevin freaking Durant. And Tisse on ky when he dropped 40 on prime Klay Thompson?    Idk about that chief
"It’s really insane tbh. Him and LeBron have eerily similar shot selections this season (with Zach opting for more threes than midrange 2s cuz analytics), but he has the midrange shooting ability of a legit SG like prime Kobe, and the knockdown 3-ball shooting of Klay Thompson.   Before the start of the season, i was hoping that Zach would make an even further jump on his game, but holy shit, he went from 45/38/80 shooting splits last season to 52/43/85 this season. Now if he could just make better passes, he’d be a truly elite offensive option. His vision is getting there, but he still makes lazy passes every game."
"Jesus.   Minnesota just keeps getting fucked by Golden State.   Tim Hardaway, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, the failed Klay trade, Andrew Wiggins, and now a first rounder in either 2021 or 2022.   I honestly feel really bad for the Wolves. Fuck you, Glen Taylor."
"The Warriors are just bad luck for the TWolves come draft time.   1989: Wolves select Point Guard Pooh Richardson with their first ever draft pick. This allows Golden State to select another Point Guard by the name of TIM HARDAWAY. Shawn Kemp and Vlade Divac were also available.   2009: Wolves use two First Round picks on Point Guards: Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn. Unfortunately, this paves the way for Golden State to pick up a PG of their own: STEPHEN CURRY. DeMar DeRozan and Jrue Holiday were also ripe for the taking.   2011: Timberwolves draft Derrick Williams at 2nd overall. A total bust. Not like the guy that went to Golden State at Pick Number 11: KLAY THOMPSON. They also missed out on Kemba Walker and Kawhi Leonard. Woof."
"Klay Thompson, your toaster is a dick"
I miss Klay Thompson
"I don’t think anyone thinks someone would take Rodney over Draymond. The reason this was posted is because a couple weeks ago Draymond and Klay Thompson were saying that Rodney was about to be out of the league, and now he had a really nice game."
And Klay has gone even longer without a 20 point game. McGruder&gt;Green and Thompson confirmed?
bogdan gives me klay thompson vibes
Playoff bubble Jamal Murray man hit some of the nastiest jumpers in those couple 50 pieces he dropped.  But Klay Thompson when he destroyed the Indiana Pacers and had 60 something. I believe he broke the 3’s in a game record that game if I’m not mistaking but it was pretty incredible to watch.
"Then why not play him at the 2? Oh right, he can’t defend shooting guards and Klay Thompson is a better player"
"yes they were.  The concept the of 'driving' and kicking' with shooters relocating on dribble drives we use to do in a drill called '4-spot' shooting back in the Late 90s. I literally could watch GSW watch how Klay Thompson, Green, Curry, etc relocate on dribble drive action, just like how we drilled 20 years ago.  And relocate based on positioning of defenders and dribbles being 'push' or 'pull' actions.  Bob Knight and Coach K use to have instructional videos about that in terms of Motion Offense.  I'm pretty sure they are out there on YouTube  Yes we weren't great shooters but 2 guys were excellent shooters.  You put a team together of 3 shooters of 3 slashers and and 2 guys who can do a little of both, you have the concept.    Yes on the NBA level is extreme because of the technical ability, the athletic ability etc.    Take something like 'Horns'.  Okay when it comes down to its still a pick-roll two-man game, and pick-roll 3-man game (typically with a player on the wing or Short-corner).  Yes, there are tons of things NBA level talent and skill can do out of it, but the actions, concepts are still the same.  Its similar to football secondary coverages.  Cover 3 and Man-Free behave the same and Cover 4 and Cover 2 behave the same."
Klay Thompson on like 8 dribbles
"I don't really agree.  Kid has all star potential and you want him to be a role player.  Kings aren't contenders with Luke Walton at the helm or even close to it.  Let Bagley make mistakes.  Jason Kidd had Giannis running point and it wasn't because he was all that skilled, the Bucks sucked, but it developed his game.  Same thing happened with Dirk in dallas, seattle had KD running at the point and at the 2 so he developed his handle and passing instead of just becoming a 6'11 klay thompson.    Fox and Bagley are the two highest ceiling dudes on the Kings.  Limiting either of them on a bad team is dumb as hell."
"The worst thing LeBron ever did was not commit to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Had he done so instead of sign one or two year contracts, we would have had the promise of some stability when recruiting free agents and coaches. Instead, the best we could ever do before 2015 was sign guys like Larry Hughes and Mo Williams. Had he stuck to his guns and said we’re playing for MY team, Dwyane Wade and either Bosh or Chris Paul would have joined instead of them going to miami and we sleepwalk the East for the next 15 years. The biggest question mark is whether we draft Kyrie Irving with the Clippers’ number one overall in 2011 and with Chris Paul and D Wade I don’t know that we do. At that point was the fo smart enough to avoid the mine field that separated 2 and 9? Best case scenario we draft Valanciunas as the heir apparent to Z but could have very well ended up with Derrick Williams, Enes Kanter, Jan Vesely, or Brandon Knight. On the other hand, maybe we look to add a sharp-shooting backup 2 guard with great defense and championship pedigree in Klay Thompson. Another question is whether David Griffen takes over the GM role? He made some brilliant moves that played a big part in our championship but would we have had a player like Kevin Love in 2015? Would his partnership with AD have started years earlier? Would peak Boogie Cousins or Lamarcus Aldridge have joined up? Would a real coach have come to Cleveland instead of the clown car of HCs we have had?  Safe to say he would have rings. Possible he would enjoy two long spells of consecutive championships broken up by a bad matchup here or there or its not outside the realm of possibility he wins a dozen or more rings"
"Bearded Jokic and Egyptian Klay Thompson, apparently"
Kyle guy turned into klay thompson against the warriors
Random? No. He was beaten by Joe Harris and Klay Thompson. Both amazing 3 point shooters.
PG: Lillard: (6'1)  SG: Steph: (6'3)  SF: MJ: (6'6)  PF: Klay Thompson (6'6)  C: Lebron James (6'8)  Peak small ball. Deal with it.
"If Klay Thompson was fit, probably him"
Nah not always true that players stick with players. For example Klay Thompson doesn’t support Rodney McGruder
"DeRozan and Thompson? Klay is a pure shooter and tough defender who rarely draws fouls or creates for others, Demar is a slasher and poor defender who often draws fouls and is great at creating for others."
He is having a nice year shooting.  Let’s see him maintain this for awhile before we declare a new Klay Thompson
"What type of logic is this?  Are we forgetting Klay Thompson got hurt as well?   I’m not talking about whats “more impressive.”  I’m saying the notion that KD can’t lead a team to a championship like Leonard is false, especially when you add context."
He’s basically worse Klay Thompson at 3 and D but with more dimes.
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"Worst fan take:  *After 1-3 bad games that an all star/MVP level player is trash/overhated/washed/exposed (aka those weird Facebook people that create accounts just to hate on like one player)  Worst YouTube Take: Lonzo Ball is Steph Curry with a 40 inch vertical  Worst Media/NBA Award: 2016 All NBA  Deandre Jordan being voted 1st team All NBA tied with James Harden not making any All NBA team (Kyle Lowry, CP3, Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook and Damien Lillard) being guards who made it over him"
"Honestly if you look at the 14-15 through 18-19 run of amazing basketball compared to the last couple seasons of absolute crap and now slightly-better-than-mediocre play, the single difference is obvious and the conclusion you can draw is clear: Klay Thompson carried those Warriors teams."
"Oh he must not realize that there were more players on the W’s than Durant and Steph. Believe it or not, Steph had help from some other pretty “okay” players. Guys like Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, David West, Andrew Bogut, Andre Iguodala, and Javale McGee. I guess he just isn’t familiar with any of those players."
Curry lebron would be great but I don't think curry could be a third option  I would need a new shooting guard possibly klay Thompson.
"What do you think that record in those two seasons is without Klay Thompson? At best they barely make the playoffs without him.   Klay Thompson is the whole fucking point of this argument. Steph is alone now without much help and now Green isn't helping much. Green can make a good team great but his impact on a bad team is basically nil, see last year. Green is a multiplicator but 5 times  0 is still zero.    But what is the impact of Curry? Can he drag them to the playoffs like CP3 and Westbrook did separately with OKC? Like Kobe in the past in the season he tore his achilles?"
"&gt; when you can trade for Paul George, you do so  By that logic, the Warriors totally should have traded Klay Thompson, because when you can trade for 2014 Kevin Love, you do so."
"Ok, well think of any player you consider roughly as good as Klay Thompson except instead of a catch and shoot guy they specialize in creating their own shot.  If i am on a good team I’d be more likely to pick Klay.  On a bad team I’d be more likely to pick the guy that specializes in making their own shot."
I think my meaning is pretty clear. You’d probably get a better sense of how good James Harden was on a bad team than Klay Thompson.
But can he do it without Klay Thompson though?
"That's a weird position to take on the Warriors. Oubre and Wiggins weren't even on the ESPN top 100. Not that that is the gospel bur it does provide some context. Wiseman is a rookie still with much to learn. That's why he got benched recently. Not to mention he just missed a whole month.  Their bench is literally made up of mostly g league players.   And don't even get me started on the salary cap point. Klay Thompson is out. And Andrew wiggins is universally recognized as the worst contract in the league.    I'll say it this way. If Steph wins more with his Roster than Lebron does with his while AD out, that will tell you all you need to know."
THJ just caught that and shot it without ever moving his arms basically that was some klay Thompson shit
Klay Thompson to the Timberwolves for Kevin Love  Steph Curry to the Bucks for Bogut
This guy just compared the career 31% three point shooter on .5 makes per game to klay thompson
"Klay Thompson shooting a jumper.  I don't like the idea of having an iconic player doing an iconic move being the logo. An every day move seems more appropriate, and what's more pure basketball essence than shooting a jumper?  Klay has textbook form so that's why I'd pick him, but other guys like Ray Allen, Carmelo, Lover, KD all have nice looking jumpers so if they were the model that would be great too."
"Boban and Steve with guest appearances from Jimmy Butler, Anthony Edwards and Klay Thompson."
40 in 3 quarters?    Klay Thompson has entered the chat.
Klay Thompson
klay thompson
"My guy... do you not understand that for a sign and trade to work BOTH sides have to approve of it? Not Kawhi and the Warriors, *the Clippers* and the Warriors. And since the Warriors are literally $80M into the luxury tax they can't sign Kawhi outright. So, contrary to a scenario where Kawhi would want to join the Hornets really really badly and Kawhi could leave for his preferred destination at a moment's notice forcing the Clippers would have to accept anything they can get before Kawhi leaves for nothing, the Clippers don't have to accept the Warriors' scraps in this deal.  In fact, the moment Kawhi's preferred destination is a place without the cap space to sign him that'll immediately drive the asking price up for that team, gives the Clippers more leverage, and lowers it for all the other teams forcing the destination to give up even more for him.   If Kawhi says ""I want to sign with the Warriors and no one else"" and they don't have the cap space to do so the asking price becomes Klay Thompson, James Wiseman, the Minnesota pick, every other pick from then to 2026, and pick swaps. Unless Kawhi is suddenly okay with taking a 1yr/$868K deal lol  *""This superstar wants to play with you and no one else so either you pay the superstar price or he's gonna be forced to re-sign with us or go play somewhere that has no realistic chance of winning a championship.""*"

Those lean post-Shaq years weren't great, but it actually looks like his last 3 seasons sunk him the most. Same story for Pierce, although for him it actually looks more like his early Celtics years sunk him."
"Except when Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are on the other team. Which in this case, they are."
"The Hampton 5 has  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Iggy  KD  Draymond  3 of them shoots 40% from 3  Bro are you just looking for excuses to say ""lol r/NBA jerks off LeBron?"" No one in their right mind takes Lebron"
"I would take prime, healthy Paul George over prime, healthy Klay Thompson"
Klay Thompson won a ring averaging 15.0 PPG on 50.7% TS for an entire playoff run. He got to play next to two of the greatest offensive players ever for 2.5 of his playoff runs. Paul George would've made the Warriors even better than they already were in Thompson's place.
"To be fair that's what a lot of people (including me) thought in this past draft. The Warriors FO doesn't often get the chance to draft a top fifteen pick, and they really crave it. The last top 15 picks they used since 2009 netted them James Wiseman, Harrison Barnes, Klay Thompson, Epke Udoh (hard miss), and Stephen Curry. They haven't missed much in the last eleven years when given a good chance."
"If Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant come back in time for the playoffs, Warriors could have a shot."
"Klay Thompson scoring 60 with 11 dribbles was pretty damn impressive, but I'm going Kobe dropping 81.. RIP mamba."
"&gt; what year are you talking about?   In 2016.  29-6-8 on 60% TS and he missed all 3 all-nba teams.   And keep in mind those numbers were even more impressive back then.   Klay Thompson finished on 3rd team with 22-4-2 on 57%TS lol.  Kyle Lowry finished ahead of him with 21-5-6. He had a great argument to be 1st team all-nba.  No one with anything CLOSE to those numbers have ever missed all-nba teams.     &gt;  there's some weird stuff that goes on with all nba and all defensive teams. several dpoy's have missed defensive first team  There's some weird stuff that happens with defensive awards, not all-nba and MVP.  And that's because defense is extremely hard to measure."
"I will give you this. I am much more swayed towards your side with the argument that you laid out.   If you look at this year the advanced metrics are less kind to Booker. Like you can lay out the statistical argument that points towards Zion and Demar having more efficient/higher impact years.   And I’m not going to act like I’m a WS/box plus minus guru over here. But I think the main driver of some of Booker’s advanced metrics being down is that he’s on a better team now. His metrics compare favorably to Klay Thompson once KD joined their team, for example.  It gives players like Zion and Demar an advantage because they have less good players on the team. Someone please let me know if I’m drawing a misleading correlation here lol"
2012. Harden was the worst superstar in 2015. I feel he’d mesh well with Kawhi/LMA taking most of the shots and Parker feeding him and Duncan. I think he’d have evolved into a Manu/Klay Thompson hybrid if coached under Pop
Every website comes out with their own version of an advanced stat that is just a slightly different formula based on box score data. They generally overrate the same kind of players and underrate the same ones.  For example high volume players like Hasan Whiteside and Luka get lots of credit for them. However players like Klay Thompson or Dennis Rodman get underrated.
LMAO wasn't no more reckless than what Danny Green did to Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson.   Raw stats mean nothing when one is a 1st option on a garbage team and the other is the 2nd option on the best team in the league.
he reminds me of like klay thompson in demeanour. just kind of laid back and fun.
Middleton should have been a lock.  Shooting the ball almost as well Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson
"Ah yes gotta love the ""Are you new here?"" argument. My favorite next to ""You never play basketball.""  If that's a flagrant the likes of Myles Turner and Giannis will be tossed out three times per game.  Were you calling for flagrants when Danny Green did this to Klay Thompson?"
&gt; not to mention danny green caused klay to tear his ACL  This is 10x the foul that Danny Green committed on Klay Thompson. Danny Green legit got ball and Klay just had an unlucky landing. If you're blaming him for the ACL tear you're absolutely delusional
"How do you feel about Klay Thompson with a Chinese shoe deal, who has also never spoken up against violence against Asians, or about Chinese politics?"
"I understand what he's saying lol, my point is that coaches don't use that reductive two-step process of comparing W-L records and then two lines of stats like the guy above me did. Did you ever consider that the NBA coaching community simply thought that Klay Thompson was a better player?"
I think people are looking too much at box scores and a few games and standings.  Middleton is the only snub I think and his offense has been spectacular and I feel like his shooting and off-ball attention he gets on defense is getting to Klay Thompson levels of ridiculousness.  He's been excellent as a playmaker and solid on defense too.  He's definitely the biggest snub in the East IMO and definitely over Sabonis.
"No, not really. Klay Thompson dropped 35 in a fucking quarter against us. Nothing will ever top that."
Because I think that Klay Thompson was better than Devin Booker?
The one that was Klay Thompson lmao. Are we really doing this blind stat line game
"Fan votes actually don't mean shit. Klay Thompson, who has played exactly 0 minutes in the NBA this season got more than 200k and was 8th in the Western Conference frontcourt. Melo and Derrick Rose both got more votes than CP3. Players can't tell the difference between Kostas and Giannis, 10% of them think Kobe is the undisputed GOAT.  Fans are fucking idiots, and players aren't much better."
Klay Thompson
KAT shot Klay Thompson 3 point numbers last season
"And don't forget let's open up our wing rotation for next season which is... Klay Thompson coming off of two years of injuries, Damion Lee, and Jordan Poole."
Yes 1 klay Thompson pls
"Scott Brooks is a fair criticism, but they had some serious injury trouble for a long stretch, and then when they all got healthy and put it all together, they were one Klay Thompson all-time-shooting-performance away from probably beating the Cavs and taking home the championship.  It's not like they were squandering the talent and never in contention.  Want to blame someone for that timeframe, blame Patrick Beverly, I know I do."
"Yikes, idk where to even start with this. Derozan averaging 30? In a slightly slower paced era that allowed hand checking and scoring was harder? Idk about that one. And middys and post ups are only bad shots if you’re bad at them. Embiid is making a living doing both. Kawhi basically won an entire series eating from the midrange. Reggie Miller an MVP candidate? Why? Because he could shoot 3s before it was cool? Is Klay Thompson an MVP candidate? The game isn’t just shooting 3s."
Ray Allen and Reggie Miller definitely belong in the conversation with Klay.  Allen shooting 43% in 2001-2002 as the primary scorer on the Bucks is more impressive than any Klay Thompson year. That was before entire offenses were designed for three point shooters too.
"They were only famous for it because the argument was ""every team does illegal screens but not every team has Steph Curry and Klay Thompson to take advantage of them so it's unfair"". It was a ridiculous argument and was based on salt."
"Honestly, I don't understand how anyone takes the two finals losses to the Warriors seriously. Nobody on earth was beating a team with prime Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, with good coaching to boot."
"The ability to create your own shot is only important if you’re the best player on your team though imo. Especially if you rely on it.  Give me a Beal/Klay to play off of a Curry/LeBron moreso than another ball dominant player.  Obviously pairings like Kyrie/LeBron are still amazing, and I think it’s nice to have multiple creators, but it becomes more an more redundant.  It is especially noticeable in the lower tier of scorers, for example D’Lo is a great shot creator, but on a contender he’s not really going to be able to get the touches to do that (as he’s at best a 3rd option on a team like that).  The Nets would also likely be much better with a Klay Thompson or even Bradley Beal type of player as their 3rd option, but obviously it’s never a BAD thing, it’s just a redundancy and you can likely get a better defensive player in that spot."
That season was a complete fluke. There’s no way you put that roster together now and they win that many games. They had Demarre Carroll out there looking like Klay Thompson. You cannot convince me that that season was not a fluke 😂
"U.S.-China tensions, human rights and business are once again meeting uncomfortably on the basketball court.  In China, local brands are prospering from a consumer backlash against Nike, H&amp;M and other foreign brands over their refusal to use Chinese cotton made by forced labor. Chinese brands have publicly embraced the cotton from the Xinjiang region, leading to big sales to patriotic shoppers and praise from the Beijing-controlled media.  In the United States, two of those same Chinese brands, Li-Ning and Anta, adorn the feet of N.B.A. players — and those players are being rewarded handsomely for it. Two players reached endorsement deals with Anta in February. Another signed on this week. Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors already had a shoe deal with Anta that has been widely reported to be valued at up to $80 million.  Dwyane Wade, the three-time N.B.A. champion and retired Miami Heat player, has a clothing line with Li-Ning that is so successful he has recruited young players for the brand.  Like the foreign brands in China, the league and its players could soon feel themselves squeezed between Washington and Beijing. Western companies are being pressured by American officials and lawmakers to respond to accusations of genocide in Xinjiang. But they face a consumer-driven backlash in China, where celebrities have severed ties with brands like Burberry and patriotic citizens have burned their Nike shoes on social media.  The N.B.A. and its athletes are familiar with the challenges of trying to stand up to China and maintain access to its nearly 1.4 billion consumers. Just two years ago, China exiled the N.B.A. from state media channels after the general manager of the Houston Rockets supported pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.  The league has so far avoided the latest round of controversy. That may not last for long.  “It’s hard to imagine celebrities and brand ambassadors being able to walk this line between those negative views of China in their home countries and the increasingly clear demands in China to publicly demonstrate the use of products made in Xinjiang,” said Natasha Hassam, director of the Public Opinion and Foreign Policy Program at the Lowy Institute in Australia.   The Chinese companies themselves are unlikely to take a significant hit. The United States banned imports of products made from Xinjiang cotton in January, but neither Li-Ning nor Anta sells large numbers of shoes there. (They are available online, however.) Still, their full-throated support of Xinjiang could have reputational consequences for the American athletes.  “It is a simpler proposition for a Chinese celebrity to say I’m going to end my ties with X European company and probably be rewarded domestically for it,” Ms. Hassam said. “Americans looking to profit off China’s market find themselves in a much more challenging place.”       After Li-Ning and Anta published positive statements on Xinjiang cotton last week, investors in China sent the share price of both companies soaring. Chinese state media was quick to fuel the show of patriotism. At one point, a pair of Li-Ning shoes under Mr. Wade’s Way of Wade line traded for nearly $7,500.  But the statements could invite regulatory scrutiny on future business operations in the United States, said Brian J. Fleming, a lawyer specializing in sanctions at Miller &amp; Chevalier Chartered.  “By speaking out, Anta and Li Ning are simultaneously supporting the Chinese government and thumbing their noses at U.S. restrictions, which is a combination unlikely to be greeted warmly by U.S. authorities,” Mr. Fleming said.  Anta and Li-Ning did not respond to requests for comment.  Mr. Thompson, one of the N.B.A.’s biggest stars, is known as “China Klay” to his Chinese fans and once said he wanted to be the Michael Jordan of Anta. His teammate James Wiseman, as well as Alex Caruso of the Los Angeles Lakers, signed with Anta earlier this year, according to the sportswear brand’s social media account. Precious Achiuwa of the Heat announced this week that he was joining Anta.  Requests for comment from Mr. Thompson and other N.B.A. players also went unanswered.  Outside China, Xinjiang has become synonymous with repression. Reports suggest as many as one million Uyghurs and other largely Muslim ethnic minorities have been held in detention camps. In March, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken accused China of continuing to “commit genocide and crimes against humanity” in the far northwestern region.  The N.B.A. has powerful reasons to keep quiet on China. When Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets, voiced his support for the Hong Kong protests on Twitter in 2019, Li-Ning and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Credit Card Center paused their partnerships with the team. The Chinese Basketball Association, whose president is the former Rockets player Yao Ming, also suspended its cooperation with the Rockets.  Mr. Morey deleted the message.  Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, later said that the Chinese government had asked the league to fire Mr. Morey, a claim that the Chinese Foreign Ministry quickly denied. But the incident left a scar on the N.B.A.’s reputation for supporting free speech and severely limited its access to the Chinese market.  China Central Television, the state-run television network, stopped broadcasting N.B.A. games after Mr. Morey’s message on Twitter. Late last year, it briefly resumed coverage for Games 5 and 6 of the N.B.A. finals. A week later, Mr. Morey stepped down as general manager.  In a radio interview this week, Mr. Silver said that CCTV had stopped airing N.B.A. games again, but that fans could stream them through Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate. He said that the N.B.A.’s partnership with China was “complicated,” but that “doesn’t mean we don’t speak up about what we see are, you know, things in China that are inconsistent with our values.”  A spokesman for the league declined to comment for this article.   Money and a large China fan base are at stake for players like Mr. Thompson and the dozens of other American athletes who have been heavily promoted by Anta and Li-Ning. Mr. Thompson has had a partnership with Anta since 2014 that has given him a popular shoe line and sponsored tours in China.  More recent deals between the companies and N.B.A. players could face questions in coming weeks as tensions between the United States and China escalate. Jimmy Butler, a five-time all-star who plays for the Heat, and the Toronto Raptors guard Fred VanVleet signed on with Li-Ning in November. Mr. Wade, the retired Heat player, helped CJ McCollum and D’Angelo Russell, two star guards, secure deals with Li-Ning through his sportswear line.  “My decision 7 years ago to sign with Li-Ning was to show the next generation that it’s not just one way of doing things,” Mr. Wade wrote on Twitter when he announced Mr. Russell’s contract in November 2019. “I had a chance to build a Global platform that gives future athletes a canvas to create and be expressive.”"
"Steph Curry has been extremely blessed with a team around him that simply could never be matched. While he is the greatest shooter of all time, he also has been blessed to have a teammate in Klay Thompson who is the 2nd greatest shooter of all time, a defensive player of the year in Draymond Green, and an MVP winner and all-time scoring titan in Kevin Durant. Curry has been able to avoid double-teams most of his career, he's had Klay and Draymond to defend the opposing team's best players, and he's been free to soak up all the fame that comes with the accolades that a perfect team accumulates and project his face into the reason it happened."
"&gt; I mean there wasn't really a gameplan to stop KD+GS but a few years worth of tape people pick up on things.  also when you finish a five-year deep finals run where you've hit ""capped out"" because you had to pay your superstars and the bench isn't as deep as it was and then you have two seasons in a row without Klay Thompson and also a big chunk of one of those seasons Steph Curry's hand got turned into tetris pieces and then you've got a bunch of young guys who aren't super great and don't know how to play with a star like Curry and your offensive system is kinda built around having *two* Splash Brothers it's gonna take some time to ""adapt"" to your ""constantly changing personnel"""
And Klay Thompson driving no where and getting stuck in the air went down too!
A better Klay Thompson. His shooting is only slightly worse and is a much better defender than Klay was at 22
"Probably not, just think about the players that were on that Golden State team that year. Prime Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, a great defensive year Klay Thompson, Andre Iguadala before he got old, Draymond Green, Clyde Drexler, rookie Michael Jordan, James Naismith's ghost, 2 clones of LeBron, dream team Christian Laettner, and the football player from The Last Boy Scout that pulls out a gun on the field. I just don't see CP3 making a huge difference that series."
"Exactly this.  Ball dominant means you hold the ball a lot on the offensive end of the floor (think CP3, Westbrook).  High usage rate means you end a possession often (with shots or turnovers).  Klay Thompson can have a decently high usage rate, but is the opposite of ball dominant because he doesn't dribble much, just gets open and shoots."
"If Nick Kerr, Klay Thompson, and Bob Myers jumped Curry two times a week he would still be a Warriors lifer"
"You mean the team with Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, and Andrew Bogut?"
"Klay Thompson, if not in a situation where he won so many titles, could've been one of the most valuable players in the nba, because of the fact that he can fit on literally any team. However because he's on golden State he never wanted to leave but say he went to the kings. In restricted free agency he could've had like 20+ teams chasing him"
Curry beat the goat before KD joined. KD choked against Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson is a much better player than Kuzma I don't think this is a great comp lol
It’s true. You have a not dumb player who can’t great but doesn’t do dumb shit all the time. I’d take him over a dumbass player any day. Like you give me the option of idk klay Thompson presently vs somebody like Kuzma? I’ll take Klay Thompson bc at least you can’t be stupid when you’re not in the game like Kuzma. My gosh Kuzma is so dumb fuck
"People always underrated it because he got attacked almost nonstop in the first couple years of them being good, but in reality he was just an around league average defender sharing the court with Andre Igoudala, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Bogut. So that’s 2 of the top 15(IMO) non big defensive players of all time; one of the best two way shooting guards of the last 15 years; a 2nd team all defense level Rim protector; and an above wing Defender with a lot of versatility. It’s hard to not to look bad when other team exclusively scheme to attack you."
"What team would be the same after replacing Kevin Durant, Iguodala, and Livingston with Andrew Wiggins, Jordan Poole, and Nico Mannion?  Not to mention Kelly Oubre replacing Klay Thompson"
The best 3 and D player of all time. Klay Thompson.
Citing True Shooting as if it an all-encompassing stats lets me know someone doesn't hoop/actually like the sport;  Jaren Jackson Jr. plays like Klay Thompson
Paul pierce career wise is better than Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson
"Golden State's salary structure is so bad that the trading Wiseman for a Star talk really doesn't make sense because they would have to move the Andrew Wiggins contract and it would probably cost them an additional asset or two to move it given the salary compared to the play. Just do the mirror test: if you are a Golden State fan, are you really letting go of Steph Curry for James Wiseman and Andrew Wiggins at 60 million over 2 years? Chances are you're not, which means that a hypothetical trade for Karl Anthony towns or kawhi Leonard or Bradley Beal probably ain't happening with the assets the warriors have available.   If the warriors get Thompson back healthy, there's a good chance that they can be a competitive team again and if they can't get him back healthy, there's a good chance that they aren't going to be a competitive team again and that's relatively independent of other factors.  The best case scenario for them is that the Minnesota pick conveys to them and then they get Klay back next year and can make a run with their big three while developing their younger players in meaningful games."

I do not like Aron Baynes no matter how bad he is solely on the fact that he became prime Klay Thompson against the sixers in that one playoff series
&gt; Klay Thompson lead his team in scoring for half the season.  can you elaborate on how you came to this conclusion
"He can be better than Thompson - he's supposed to be, which is why I bring up Klay outscoring him - but he wasn't better than Harden that regular season.   Look how wild people are going when Curry gets close to an 8 seed this season. Harden took a worse team to the 2 seed.  Anything to dismiss the dude I guess. So many years of people using the entire Warriors roster success over Harden, only to now freak out when Curry has a .500 winning % the first time he doesn't have allstar teammates lol."
Klay Thompson lead his team in scoring for half the season. Curry averaged 24 ppg.  He shouldn't of won this one.
I think there’s merit to the idea that Jokic improves the TS% of players around him but not as much as this guy is implying. MPJ still has elite shooting talent and has been Klay Thompson esque in his ability to get his offense without needing to dribble
I don't follow NBA all that much. I know that Klay Thompson is injured and Kevin Durant left. But still: How come they suck so hard now when they dominated just 3 years ago?
"Well, because 1/3 of our cap goes to Steph, 1/3 goes to defense in Draymond, and 1/3 goes to the bench in the form of Klay Thompson.  Our $20m over tax for Oubre turns into another $40m of taxes, which leaves a bag of Doritos to pay for everyone else that isn't on rookie contracts."
Only time I want a full arena is when Klay Thompson plays his first NBA game again
Klay Thompson will be back but I’m sure a different superstar will be out for the season. Has there ever been a season with no stars out for a whole season
Somebody like Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant. But that would just be silly.
"Naw, it's Klay Thompson on a hot night easily. Imagine if those guys played together."
"Assume no superstars its most likely klay Thompson, he provides everything you need in a nba player. Including superstars its LeBron and its not close lol"
Steph Curry  Michael Jordan  Kobe Bryant  Kevin Durant  Klay Thompson  Draymond Green  DeMar DeRozan  Dirk Nowitzki  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Andre Iguodala
Klay Thompson
The answer is always Klay Thompson
I do miss watching klay Thompson play. One of my favorite players to watch
Yeah Klay Thompson.
"I mean, if you’re looking for the 5th best guy on a team he does fit that role better than Trae. That doesn’t really qualify him as a better player. Klay Thompson isn’t better than LeBron James because he fits better off ball with Curry."
"Kobe, AI, Nick van exel, klay Thompson, dame time, Tmac, Melo, bron, Kareem, magic"
Probably Klay Thompson. Everyone needs a 3 and D player and he can be the first option for the team if needed. Also is super clutch in the playoffs and raises the ceiling of any team
Klay Thompson if we're not including superstars
Klay Thompson also exist
"1-10  Steph Curry, D Rose, Joakim Noah, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, Scottie Pippen, Michael Jordan,  Zach Lavine,  Russel Westbrook, Dennis Rodman"
Marcus Camby Scottie Pippen Chris Paul Manu Ginobli Andre Miller Baron Davis  Klay Thompson Hedo Turkoglu Kevin Johnson Shai Gilgeous Alexander
"Healthy Klay Thompson is the best 3-and-D player ever imo. He has a few more dimensions to his game (very good at cutting) than the average 3-and-D player, and he's obviously very elite at both shooting from range and defense."
"It is a populated position and yet it isn't, because there aren't many players who fit squarely into the 3&amp;D mold.  They can't be too good on offense or they will be more than just 3&amp;D.  Kawhi Leonard started his career as a 3&amp;D player, but now is a bonafide superstar.  Is Klay Thompson a 3&amp;D player?  Some would say he's too good for that as well.  If he's still a 3&amp;D player, he's the best when healthy -- but maybe he's too good.  But they also have to balance excellent and frequent three point shooting with excellent defense, and not be too much of one or the other. The problem is that three point shooting can be volatile.  Robert Covington has always been considered a premier 3&amp;D player, but last year his three point shooting deserted him, as he only hit 33.5% of his threes.  Yet this year he's back near 40%.  The other problem is that catch-and-shoot three point shooters may not score much.  Despite his good three point shooting percentage this year, Covington is mostly a great defender who scores 9 points a game.  He makes one assist and one turnover per game.  So his real contribution on offense is small. How much does a 3&amp;D player have to score to be considered an offensive asset, and if he scores 20 points per game like Klay Thompson is he too good to be called a 3&amp;D player?  I'm just saying it's not easy to define whether someone is a true 3&amp;D players, yet not a star.  Lots of players are loosely placed in that category, but most of them have strengths and weaknesses that makes the classification suspect."
Two good example of 3 and D player's in the NBA would be Klay Thompson and Danny Green.
Shout out to that Youtuber that said he was just a worse version of Klay Thompson.
The Warriors get klay thompson back.  Their core is fine
"The real answer here (for guys that are actually role players, not Klay Thompson) is Joe Ingles"
No better role player then klay thompson
The Warriors just need Klay Thompson to not die by next season.
"Luka, dame and harden are locks. Steph too assuming he doesn’t miss any more games, if he plays 60+ he’s in, maybe even 1st team still.  That leaves two spots for Booker, Paul, Mitchell, LaVine (probably won’t get it based on record) Beal (same as LaVine) Kyrie (who has missed 15 games) and despite not making an all star team Trae Young could be in there if his team makes a top 5 seed in the east.   It’s crazy, for how deep the west was at guard just a couple years ago, between injuries to guys like CJ, Klay, and Westbrook declining, plus young guys like Ja, SGA, Fox, and maybe Trae not quite being ready yet, guard is not quite as deep as it was when Steph, dame, Westbrook, Kyrie, CP3, and Harden were all arguably top 12 players in the league with 6 guard spots, plus Lowry, Thompson etc etc"
"Robinson blows all those guys out of the water in terms of moving off ball and shooting off the catch. He's close to prime Korver, Redick, Klay Thompson types as shooter than anyone you mentioned. Not saying he won't be overpaid but you're underselling his game a lot."
The forearm on his side is a common defensive move used by the best defensive players like Klay Thompson. Its a harden type move because the referees are pretty 50/50 on whether or not its a foul in most if not all games. Either the ref calls it as a check or they don't.
"TL;DR: He’s a fucking rookie and a big piece of the Warriors is injured, chill out  I’m glad redditors aren’t GMs. To anyone reading this post, notice how OP didn’t once mention Klay Thompson.   In the last paragraph you say that the Warriors would be better off not signing Oubre or drafting Wiseman. How can you make these claims when the whole point of signing Oubre was an attempt to stop the bleeding from a lack of Klay or that the Warriors are in semi-rebuild mode since they have the Minnesota pick? If they didn’t sign Oubre, then who do you think they should have signed? It was a gamble, they got burned, but at least they tried and took a risk. Taking Wiseman gave them a better opportunity to land a great future player and the Minnesota pick will continue to provide them an opportunity to build for the future.  You argue LaMelo &gt; Wiseman but neither one was definitively better than the other pre-draft without 20/20 hindsight on an incredibly small sample size.  The Warriors system relies on Klay getting buckets. Dray is completely unlocked when Steph and Klay are sky fucking. More importantly, the Warriors cannot expect to compete without Klay or a Klay equivalent so why are we completely writing off a rookie during a throwaway season? The only key take away should be how absurd Steph is and Reddit needs to learn patience during unconventional times."
Klay “Savage Badass” Thompson  Dude has a dog named Rocco and smoked formerly illegal drugs!!!!
"What Klay Thompson comment, I’m so curious now lol"
This up there with that klay Thompson comment all the way back on levels of unfunniness
"I don’t feel persecuted in any way, I was simply trying to discuss why you think Kelly Oubre is worthy of starting over Klay Thompson. It looks like rather than make a legitimate argument you resulted to making fun of me, so it looks like that won’t be happening any time soon."
"I'm a fan of the team, go put on a klay thompson flair"
"Dude, *I'm* qualified to be a starter, because the only qualifications to start in the NBA are things like ""you have to be over 19 and a year out of high school"".  I'm not *good enough*, but that's a different question.  Kelly Oubre is not good enough to take a starting spot from Klay Thompson, and it's a problem that he thinks he's too good to come off the bench. He's not better than Andre Iguodala. He's also not better than Manu Ginobili was, when he started coming off the bench.  Given the degree to which the biggest problem with his play is BBIQ, it's a real problem that he's apparently *not smart enough to come off the bench*."
Klay Thompson is coming off a torn ACL *and* torn achilles
The human bong ended up on the same team as Klay Thompson. Coincidence? I think not.
"Yeah, the Warriors weren’t exactly expecting Klay Thompson to tear his Achilles the day after the draft. This revisionist history is so fucking stupid."
"Imagine going to bat this hard for a role player shooting 43.6% fg and 30.5% from 3 on the season. Outliers you say? Career 43.2% from the field, 32.5% from 3. I’m not saying he’s the worst player in the NBA, but if Klay Thompson is on your team he is definitely the more attractive option to start lmao"
"Sorry m8, hope a 32 year old Klay Thompson coming off of two season ending injuries shows up and is able to turn a bad 10th seed into an 8th seed.  But I won't hold my breath."
"More like Oubre needs to perform better to guarantee he won't come off the bench.  He is not starting over Klay freakin' Thompson, and even Andrew Wiggins is making a case for the starting 3 going forward."
Mate look at videos of Dwight Howard practicing 3's. He looks like Klay Thompson. He can hit even corner 3's.
Of course silly me. Obviously Oubre belongs in the same playing field as Klay fucking Thompson.
"The Warriors are not fucked at all, the post KD era has actually been orchestrated beautifully for the most part. Replacing Durant leaving with a valuable DLo Russell.   Trading DLo for Wiggins was a huge risk but the potential from it could be massive especially if the Warriors get their pick in the upcoming stacked draft. Wiggins has shown a ton of upside during his stay on the Warriors, he will probably stay on the Warriors for the rest of his contract unless he becomes so good that he's considered worth the money at which point they could sell high on him.   It isn't the GMs fault that Klay Thompson gets injured AGAIN after a bad injury in the finals already. $35.6 million dollars going to waste sucks. I mean are you forgetting this BIG factor? Thompson is the second option on this team. The Warriors just don't have money to spend for good rotation pieces. At best they could downgrade Wiggins to a few guys on smaller contracts (maybe a Grizzlies trade for JV and Kyle Anderson). They could consider dangling that Minnesota pick in there too. The Grizzlies have a ton of great rotation pieces to give out.   This year sucks, it sucks to watch Curry in his prime waste a year. It happened to LeBron in his last year on the Cavs and his first on the Lakers. It's pretty much unavoidable though, especially with Klay out. Next year the Warriors should be looking very interesting. They'll be off Oubre and might be able to bring in someone else, hopefully they'll have a good draft selection, and the new guys will have had time to build chemistry. The 2021 Warriors could be viewed as comparable to the 2019 Lakers where there's a ton of potential but it isn't moving quick enough but one good move could be on the horizon to turn them into a team comparable to the 2020 Lakers."
"If we’re being real, this warriors team is not that bad and is severely underperforming. They should not be as low as their are now, just a couple games ahead of okc. They are essentially only missing klay Thompson, the addition of whom supposedly makes them a title contender. Also Harden has the ability to basically become the offensive on any team he is on. Curry either does not want to do that or cannot."
"Plus klay thompson injury fucked them hard. If I remember right, that’s why they traded for oubre which has panned out well"
is mpj just gonna be the second coming of klay thompson one day
Nah he is really a 6'10 version of Klay Thompson
"Ray would have been fun to watch if he was able to chuck like players now, but he never had an elite handle like Curry. The more interesting argument would be if you'd rather have prime Ray Allen or Klay Thompson behind him."
It’s the natural result of having effectively 1/4 of our payroll not on the floor. We’ve lost so many close games where a Klay Thompson would’ve entirely made the difference.
Don’t forget Klay Thompson
"Your franchise was a klay Thompson ACL away from fading into irrelevancy  Actually fuck it, they have faded into irrelevancy   God bless"
"I will give you answer from my experience in playing organized basketball.    Controlling the pace or dictating the tempo of the offensive play is done by the player who handles the ball. With the ball in his hands he decides what will he do once the attack gets going.   First fundamental thing you need to have is dribbling / not being stripped, and also not being cornered which makes you lose the ball. That's why it's so hard for big forwards and centers to be playmakers, they can't be safe with the ball at all times. Of course guys like Giannis, Durant and Jokic are exceptions.   Second fundamental thing you need is shot creation for yourself. Being able to drive at opportunity, shoot when necessary and attack on isolation. This is what many great 3andD guard guys lack, for example Klay Thompson is a better player than many first options in this league but there is not a team which will give Klay Thompson a position of first option player of the franchise. If you can't create points without being spoon fed the ball, your team will get found out on nightly basis. Second and first fundamental thing go hand in hand.   Third fundamental thing you need to have is passing ability, no matter how good of a shooter or offensive threat you are you need to be able to see open guys and pass to them. Jordan Clarkson can score 40 points a night and he still is not a good pace controller or play maker.   And the last thing that separates great playmakers from others is game experience and BBIQ. Knowing when to attack fast, knowing when to set a play and use as much of 24 seconds as possible and still score and things like that. For example when your team is down 10 points, and there is 3 minutes left on the clock, you can't really waste 24 seconds and you will try to get easy points as much as possible. Or for example when you are chasing a comeback you need rhythm and fast points, on the other side when you are leading and opponents are catching up, you use as much clock as possible to try to kill the momentum.   Now I'm sure that any NBA level playmaker knows all this and more, and what separates the guys you mentioned is that they are exceptional in one of the fundamentals.   LeBron is such a big offensive threat that he must be guarded by multiple guys, you must clogg the paint or else he will score 40 points just by layups,  you must also have one guy guard him in shooting areas since he can shoot and on top of all that he can dish it out to anyone. This gives him so much freedom and base to try to control and decide what's going to happen in offense.   Same as CP3, yes he can score, and he won't lose the ball, but also his passing and vision is legendary so the defenders can't do much but abide by his decisions on offense, which makes him great pace controller.   Luka and Harden fall in same category, great shooters who are great at driving and at passing. So the offense is set up in way for them to ISO, and find open man/kick out when they get doubled. That's a great tool for controlling the pace, am I going to shoot a stepback five seconds in, am I going to dribble in one spot for 20 seconds and just drive/get free throws, am I going to call for PnR and alley oop. There is equal chance of me doing all of this and it will all punish you if needed, that's why you can't commit to stopping one you need to think about all of it which makes my decision control the game pace."
"He’s not over 30, first off.   Secondly, max contracts change year to year, so you can’t use the actual numbers as comparison. That’s not how it works.  Anyway...  Chris Paul got a max over 30. Dame Lillard got a **supermax** at 30. Klay Thompson got a max at 30. Kyle Lowry got a max at 30.  If we bump it down to just one year younger...  Westbrook got a **supermax** at 29. John Wall got a **supermax** at 29. Kemba got a max at 29. Steph Curry got a max at 29. Jimmy Butler got a max at 29. Mike Conley got a max at 29.  Should I keep going?"
He kind of looks like Klay Thompson.
"Duncan Robinson ( 453 3P) is also older than Wiggins (641 3P) by a year. Duncan is also closer in age to Klay Thompson (4year, 2.5 months) than Trae (4year, 5 months) or Luka (4year, 10 months). That's what happens when you enter the league at 24, instead of 19 like some of the high profile guys."
He needs guys like Klay Thompson
"pretty sure the whole ""most skilled"" lamelo-wiseman thing was just people misunderstanding the tagline -- thompson/kawakami (cant remember who wrote it) said that it was only some people in the f.o. who thought that lamelo was more talented, and that the majority still wanted wisemen.  i do agree, that you don't necessarily BPA when you have a narrow window, but that's probably the most valid criticism of the Wiseman pick too -- centers take a bunch of time to develop, and we don't have that luxury w/ Steph Klay and Dray. still, though, he could easily take a leap -- kevon went from looking absolutely not like an nba player in his 2nd year to someone with a veteran game (despite being sapped by injuries) in his 4th."
"As a pacers fan I like to think that Reggie Miller would’ve been like Klay Thompson with lesser defensive ability, but slightly greater shot creation ability (for himself not necessarily others), running his own team. Would be damn fun to be able to watch him hoist up 12 3’s a game in this era"
How is Klay Thompson overrated?
Hornets announcers are third. Zu and Alaa are second. Announcer Klay Thompson is #1
"This is incorrect.  It's at least 17, and I swore it's 18:  https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2018/10/29/18040904/2018-nba-golden-state-warriors-set-nba-record-17-threes-in-a-half-klay-thompson-steph-curry"
 It’s klay thompson
"No, not enough to sign anyone that would contribute more than even a 60% Klay Thompson. We currently have the biggest payroll in the league.  We have Wiggins 30M, Dray 22M, Curry 40M on the books.  Our best option is Klay coming back healthy, making any drastic moves like this before that wouldn’t be risk assessment, it would be a terrible use of assets.  The positive is, KD has looked pretty good coming back from a similar injury, and Wall’s issues have mostly been due to his reliance on athleticism. Klay is a pure shooter, even if his defense is limited by the injuries, he will be better than whatever 10M we can free up to go after someone in FA."
Klay Thompson
"&gt;Warriors were without one of their greatest weapons  That's right, all they had were Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston. I can't see a team with those players really achieving much. No idea how the Blazers couldnt beat that team"
Ironically the 4 biggest playoff declinerd (from their regular season stats) are Curry and Harden in box score +Efficiency . And in impact metrics it is CP3 and Klay Thompson.  Even then a lot of those decrease in stats for curry harden and CP3 can be explained by their injuries.  Whilst I wouldn't describe them as chokers it isn't as if their overall reputations are unfounded in regards to the playoffs. Especially since they have all run into very very good defensive teams who focus entirely on taking their offence away and forcing their teammates to beat them.
&gt; Klay Thompson is ‘Wet-Fire’  They did Klay *dirty*. Why didn’t they just call him ‘Splash Brother’?
"Honest to god, teams fucked Draymond up when they just said ""make as many as you like, you're not Steph Curry or Klay Thompson so we're leaving you open"".  Seems ridiculous to think that a player would just go hot and cold like that, but Dray is such an emotional player.  Add on that, I think he started practicing a bit less when KD joined."
"Love Justinian's game, he's easily the Hawks best player and scored easier and defended better than Ball did when he was on the team. I get it, completely different players but Justinian's style of play is tailor made for the Warriors. He really looks like Klay Thompson out there without the early career Klay-ups"
"&gt;Yes and he also needs to log minutes to even get paid for this season or something like that.   All NBA contracts are guaranteed. Klay Thompson, for example, is getting paid 100% of his salary this year."
They both went to the conference finals and nearly to the finals.  And Klay Thompson beat others when it mattered is he a superstar?
"G- Jason Kidd  G- Klay Thompson  F-  Kawhi Leonard  F- LeBron James  C - Pau Gasol  Good passing, shooting, at-rim finishing and point of attack defense. You have the option to orchestrate from any point on the floor with Kidd, LeBron &amp; Pau. It's also a reasonably mobile and switchable lineup."

"See the reality is kids of superstars almost never live up to the hype. Now kids of role players? I’m looking at Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Devin Booker, Damontas Sabonjs. Oh yeah let me get some Joe Ingles and mash it up with a little Matysse Thybulle hmmm"
Cp3   Klay thompson ( if healthy if not give me CJ McCollum)  Brandon Ingram   KD   AD
Could I have a [GSW] Klay Thompson flair please :)
Someone hasn't watched much Klay Thompson...  He was great as the first option back in 2016 when Steph went down.
Big klay thompson.  MPJ has very little in the way of guard skills.  Could develope some but it's rare to do.
"""There's one ball. Guess what we'll do -- we'll put it in the hoop""  -Klay Thompson when he was asked about this stupid logic"
"People love the KD comp, but Porter should seek to be a taller Klay Thompson. With Jokic and a hopefully healthy Murray, the Nuggets don't need an additional ball handler. Instead Porter should continue to improve his off-ball movement, pass and relocate, and cutting skills. Jokic doesn't even like to score so I could see Porter averaging 30+ if he perfects that skillset."
The Celtics have a Klay Thompson
Idk who wins the title but Klay Thompson probably doesn't tear his ACL and then his achilles a year later while rehabbing the previous injury
"We have Oubre's bird rights.If I recall 17 teams are capped out meaning that if he wanted to the majority of teams, it would need to be a sign and trade for him to get high value. So either we keep him since we can pay him or we get something for him.   The teams with space, if I'm correct, are the Pacers, Magic, Hawks, Rockets, Pelicans, Cavs, Pistons, Bulls, Mavs, Grizzlies, Heat, Hornets, Raptors, Spurs, Thunder   A lot of those teams have their own players (for example Robinson) that will need paying. Not many hot markets for him to want to go to. It's clear that we will be setting our sights on a mid playoff spot next year at minimum.    The Wolves pick is very likely ours and I think we keep it. If nothing else because it's a cheap player.    Our best bet is to move Paschall and Smiley, sign Chriss or some other center, and hope 1-2 vets want to join us.   We also have NBL legend Justinian ""Klay Thompson"" Jessup coming."
"Yeah I usually think of players like that, because what they’re capable of is what can often be expected in the playoffs/ when it matters. I know what Paul George can do defensively, he may not show it much this regular season but he’s still got it. Kinda like with Klay Thompson, hasn’t played a minute this year, I can expect him to come in an shoot 40% from 3 whenever he comes back"
It's weird. The only way I see Lebron making it is because he's Lebron.  If that was Klay Thompson (insert random player here - I just chose one who didn't play this year) with the exact same stats but missed 28 games of 72? He wouldn't make it the All-NBA team.   The precedent is there for Lebron to make it though. Curry made 3rd team in 2018 playing in 62% of the games. Lebron will likely play in 61%.
"He has a better 3pt % than any Klay Thompson season with 2.8 makes a game. Not to mention since the All-Star break, he is making 3.2 makes a game on 47.3% from 3.   It’s crazy how much potential he has. With his size, athleticism, and shooting touch he could easily become a 1st team All-NBA guy."
"&gt;it isn’t an opinion. It’s an absolute fact.  Well no, facts are something that can be empirically proven. What you’re providing is absolutely an opinion in every sense of the word.  &gt;3 and D players are the easiest to find in the league  They actually aren’t at all. 3&amp;D players are by far the most coveted type of player there is next to all stars, and they don’t grow on trees whatsoever.   And that’s not even mentioning that reducing Klay to simply a 3&amp;D player is misleading. OG Anunoby is a 3&amp;D player. Klay Thompson is the second best 3 point shooter to ever exist.  So yeah, totally an opinion and not a fact whatsoever. Sorry."
"He lived up to it today.  And that's enough, because the Warriors have Steph Curry and are going to get Klay Thompson back, and if Andrew Wiggins is a rock-solid defender who makes a decent contribution on O... except when the team really needs him and then he *steps the fuck up* like this?  He's worth it.  Not that he wouldn't be anyway, because *the Warriors are capped anyway* and Wiggins is a perfect fit. There is no way the Warriors could replace him with a better player, there just isn't."
Imagine if Klay Thompson was back.
THT would be a scrub on the Kings.  Put a Laker uniform on him turns this random guy into Klay Thompson
"Klay Thompson, you may have heard of him.  Oubre, Paschall, Lee, and Wiseman too.  ""Some pieces"" my ass"
"Klay's help defensive and general IQ are waaaaaaay more than adequate. You just compared him to literal defensive savants, which I think is a little unfair. There was a point when Klay Thompson was the second worst defender on a lineup (the Hamptons death lineup or whatever it's called) That's what's really nuts."
Well let's start with Klay Thompson...
"If you really want to argue who was missing more, we haven’t had Klay Thompson all year."
"Just call him Reggie ""Klay Thompson"" Bullock please"
"&gt;These are all suggestions that are not the auction. “Aside from the auction \[the NBA\] can adopt some of there several other policies”  How is your proposed reset going to work without an auction?  How will you redistribute all the players?  &gt;You can have multiple schools in the same city, but if there were academies they can easily get enough talent / players who couldn’t get into the NY or LA ones.  Great, so the small market teams get to pick from the leftovers who couldn't even get into the better academies.  That sounds like a recipe for competitive imbalance.  That'd be like restricting the small market teams to only drafting D2 and D3 players today -- which would of course cause them to fold in no time.  &gt;Football is a team sport and many players get shuffled around constantly.  American football players do not.  &gt;These plug in play players get paid well in the NBA too (Danny Green got $15 mil a year for being a 3 and D. Klay got a max etc.)  Klay Thompson is a Warrior lifer, so far.  Maybe you were thinking of someone else.  Danny Green struggled to one of his worst career seasons when ""plugged in"" to the Lakers last year, after his best season in Toronto.  &gt;Having a rental player is also how a finals team has been built since 2011.  No.  Not single-season rentals, first of all, only Toronto did that.  And the '14 Spurs, '15 Warriors, '16 Cavaliers Champs were not led by any rentals.  Arguably, the '20 Lakers were not led by Davis, either.  Among Finals losers, the '20 Heat rented no one, and neither did various other Cleveland teams, or the '13 Spurs.  &gt;Look at basically every Lebron team where is the ultimate plug and play star and basically surround him with decently capable players on short contracts while he’s there  Wade was nearly a Miami lifer.  Bosh only played for two teams in his career.  Irving was not rented by Cleveland.  Love has only played for two teams in his career.  I don't think you have any idea what you are saying.  &gt;Again just to emphasize no auction. \[snip\] Every 10 years or so there’s a big reset where everyone becomes available.  See first question above, again.  You are missing something critical here."
"Nah, Klay Thompson is the Scottie Pippen to Curry's Jordan. The Warriors were a notable dynasty (still could be, depending on next year). Just because he's a quiet second option doesn't mean he'll be forgotten."
"I say this as a big Klay fan, but Klay Thompson is a bit the same in living in Steph's shadow. I'm sure he won't be as forgotten as much as a lot of the other names listed here, but he's constantly being the guy next to Steph. That along with his quiet personality. I can see in 20 years GOAT talks about Steph, Draymond on TV, and Klay just quietly chilling on the beach kind of all forgotten."
C: Wilt Chamberlain  PF: Dirk Nowitzki  SF: Larry Bird  SG: Reggie Miller  PG: Steph Curry  Bench  Bill Russell  Ray Allen  Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant  Pete Maravich  Bobi  Tobi
"Klay Thompson is the 4th best SG of all time, behind only MJ, Kobe, and Wade. He's better than Harden, AI, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Clyde Drexler, Iceman, all those dudes."
"Kawhi will be largely forgotten in America. Klay Thompson is another one despite being a better all-around player than Steph  I think its easier to say who WILL be talked about in 20 years, thats LeBron, KD, Curry, maybe Giannis. The streets will never forget Dame unless he ring chases"
"The advanced and counting stats point is true, but it still doesn't account for the context of how the Cavs were defending Golden State. The Cavs sold out to attempt to stop Curry and Klay and basically sent no help to KD, even on switches. The end result was seeing KD score a ton of his buckets one-on-one against guys like JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, and George Hill, which wouldn't have been possible without Curry as his PG. Obviously KD gets credit for having a great offensive series, but the situation that lead to his success was partially dependent on Curry.   IMO Durant still deserved FMVP both times, but it's not as clear cut as you'd think just based on the offensive numbers."
"you'd be naive to think Klay Thompson, the second greatest shooter in the history of the NBA is not gonna be able to shoot anymore. sure his defense might be not be great anymore, but he's gonna be a dangerous shooter. look at KD who came back from an achilles this year and he's having his greatest shooting season yet. Klay will be fine, his game wasn't built around athleticism like a Blake Griffin or Derek Rose.   second, simple man, you're assuming the rookies are gonna be 19 years old. they could draft seniors for all you know or the 19 year olds could be ready to make an impact like Lonzo Ball. that's besides the point because the Warriors wont be giving the rookies anything more than 10-15 mins a game and even less in the playoffs. they're just gonna be providing some depth on the bench.   not too mention this is the first year playing together for the majority of these guys without an offseason to practice. they're gonna have way more chemistry next year and be a lot more comfortable in the system.   you're naive as a banana brain if you think the Warriors are gonna be an 8th seed again next year. you're gonna be the first one who says it's not fair that the Warriors are getting a lotto pick because they're team has too much talent when the Wolves pick conveys lol.  stupid lebron stan."
"Neither was Klay, but it was still an important component of Golden State's defense, and Harden is one of the few guards in the NBA who can somewhat replicate Klay Thompson in that regard."
"Everyone is going to focus on the offensive side of this (obviously and understandably) but Harden is a fantastic post defender too, which also helps mitigate the Klay Thompson injury. They could beat anybody, and would go as far as their shooting will take them."
"you can win a championship while developing players lol. the Warriors are the 8th seed without their second best player and also had a bunch of new players this year without a real offseason to build chemistry.   with Klay Thompson back next year, the rest of the squad having more chemistry from playing together and potentially two first round picks to add to the bench's depth the Warriors should easily be championship contenders. just as long as Klay is able to come back and be atleast 85% of what he was before he left. which he should be able to do, I have suspicions about his defense, but his 3 point shooting will still be elite."
Klay “He’s just mad he’s gonna be outta the league in a few years” Thompson😂  Klay’s ruthless   https://youtu.be/53weJEtZGlY
klay thompson effect
Same.  Cries in Klay Thompson  Cries in James Wiseman  Cries in Kelly Oubre
"&gt; A healthy Klay Thompspn brings all time great shooting and good perimeter defense to a team. You could plug him into any dynamic duo, and he will seamlessly fit in as the third wheel. He does not need to be ball dominant. He can get hot quickly. Tremendous off ball movement and great hustle.  Yeah, a healthy Klay Thompson would be an ideal 3rd option (and he's shown it). But he's also been a 2nd option before, so I don't know if he qualifies."
draymond steph pick n rolls are such a cheat code when you have KLAY THOMPSON spotting up on the weak side
Klay Thompson has been injured the whole year.
Klay Thompson
"they were all good players that were instrumental to the run, if you take them off the team to just replace with “shooters” then they don’t go as far. Just watch the 2016 series against the warriors. The players you listed totally threw the warriors offensive scheme for a loop. Yeah if you could replace Andre Roberson with klay thompson or an elite 3 and D guy then they would’ve gone further but that’s not realistic is it?"
That thing went down how a Klay Thompson shot goes down.
"You can’t discount genes.  Steph’s dad, brother, and him, all being elite NBA shooters is genuinely incredible.  Like, Mychal Thompson was great, but not in the same way Klay is great!  Makes me think we might be waiting a while."
These types of posts should be bannable offenses. I could bet everything i own and ever will own that Robinson will never be better than Klay Thompson
He’s more jj redick than klay Thompson lol
"&gt;	I was talking to my nephew during Mother’s Day and he said Duncan will be a better shooter than Klay Thompson.  Oh he’s a nephew alright, that’s for sure"
Chill bro he on a different level than klay Kit Kat Thompson
Why the hell did bullock turn into klay Thompson today
I guess Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are scrubs. The rare self burn lmao
Klay Thompson in Game 6 vs OKC was one of the most unreal performances I've seen
Like a Klay Thompson...
"Who has been injured for Golden State? And dont go around mentioning Klay Thompson because he got injured before the season even started.  It really takes a certain level of delusion to believe the quality of the league is higher and tougher in a season that didnt even have a summer camp, has been an anomaly as far as injuries go, has had multiple players per team quarantine for weeks?  Okay dude lmao. Reasoning isnt your strongest suit so I wont argue further"
Just imagine how trashed that dude Klay Thompson is now that he’s had two injuries I’ve been out for two years he’s going to come back and average five points per game
"I want to see them give him a full Klay Thompson-style ""just fucking shoot it"" game."
"Steph Curry is the MVP.  This team he is leading to wins is insane.  If Curry had the talent (even just Klay Thompson) around him this year that Jokic has the Warriors would be a better team.   He is bending the NBA.   Jokic puts up fine numbers every night, but WAAaay too much emphasis is being placed on seed and team record.   How many Gleaguera playing minutes on the Warriors?"
"&gt; anyone remember that all time player draft tnt did like 10 years ago? I feel like you could actually make a good argument for Steph as the first pick in that scenario.  Only cause Charles dumb enough to take AI first.  I dont think you can realistically make those statements about Steph in my opinion.   No one would take him over a prime MJ or LBJ.   I mean Steph is the greatest shooter but he also is a huge liability on defense compared to all those guys and they're all gonna be relatively the same in terms of offensive impact.  He may space the floor better because his shooting but I could honestly argue Klay Thompson ahead of if your building a perfect team.  Spaces just as well, can let a better pure PG run the offense and is above average on defense.     Give someone 2 players to build around and 1 *has* to be MJ.  If you're not picking the best player ever to build around you're just flat out wrong.  So then it leaves 1 slot to find who would complement MJ and the team the most.  Steph is in the running no doubt but I think there are a few people you could advocate for.  Obviously LBJ, Shaq, Kareem, Hakeem, Kobe, Bird, Magic, Wilt, Durant, etc.  Not to say Steph is a wrong choice but I dont think hes a unanimous selection as top 2 player to build best team ever around.  In an ideal team he might be one of the starting 5, I just dont think he would be the 2nd most important."
I feel like Klay Thompson hasn’t played in NBA since 2013
"He would play that defense when he upped his intensity. Especially showed up in the playoffs as he'd be so effective and disruptive to guys like Tim Duncan, both Gasol brothers, Klay Thompson, Serge Ibaka, Dwight Howard, etc. It's really flourished ever since his last year with the Clippers then on to the Pistons and now the Nets, he plays so physical and with a high motor that just frustrates guys."
Did you forget that the Warriors don't have their elite bench anymore? Or Klay Thompson for that matter?
Haven't seen steph go that hot in a while. some straight up klay thompson vibes there.
"""Klay Thompson is 2nd in ranking for most games with 10 three pointers with 5. This player is first with 22.""  -Alex"
ESPN: Is Klay Thompson paying Steve Kerr to help preserve his shooting record?
"Compared to similar lists that have been posted to r/NBA, this one is not bad at all. The criteria is interesting and it clearly takes work and dedication to do something so indepth, so kudos! Personally, I have a few main points of disagreement:  1) I feel like Anthony Davis is way too high. 52nd best player of all time? C'mon. He's an incredible player that can certainly get to that level, but putting him above Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dominique Wilkins, and almost 50 spots up on current players like Joel Embiid, Klay Thompson, and Nikola Jokic is bonkers.   2) Carmelo is *way* too low. 10th (about to be 9th) all time scorer, 10 all star appearances, a scoring title, 12 playoff appearances, and 6 all nba selections -- that is an insane career. Putting players such as Dwight Howard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, and Tracy McGrady above him makes no sense -- at least not statistically.   3) Why isn't Luka on the players too young right now? You have Devin Booker (age 24), Ben Simmons (age 24), and Jayson Tatum (age 23) on that list -- how is Luka's career someone more definable at 22? Simmons and Tatum have 2 and 3 playoff appearances respectively, Luka has 1. Could Luka be a top 10 player of all time in 10 years? Absolutely! But if you're looking at longevity and accolades, why is he above Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, and Demar Derozen?  Anyway -- cool list! I had a good time looking over it."
Add klay Thompson to current lakers team
"Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudmire, Shawn Marion, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Nikola Jokic, Manu Ginobilli, Tony Parker, Scottie Pippen, Paul George, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Joakhim Noah, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady...  That should be about 30 player drafted after the top 3 (which is the goal of tanking) and most of them have been late lottery picks, even some second rounder.  All these players let your franchise be a contender, or at least compete for the second round.  Sure you could nitpick on guys like Shawn Marion, AK47 or even Dray and Manu, but all these players are a product of clever drafting over mindless tanking for the first pick."
"If all-time greats are supposed to dominate in any era, is this thread admitting that Klay Thompson isn’t an all-time great?"
"Lmao,ask Klay Thompson about what it's like guarding Kyrie."
There's bad shooters like Draymond and Westbrook and then there's literal non shooters like Simmons. Nobody expected him to be Klay Thompson but expecting him to at least be a Draymond Green level shooter was apparently too much. The guy is just straight up scared to shoot
Huh that’s weird the last 9 plays just say klay Thompson contested 3 make.
"Y’all dumbasses can talk about health all you want. Did you forget this is a sport? Which also includes injuries? This isn’t 2K where you can just turn the settings off. There’s no point putting asteriks on things because someone couldn’t stay healthy. There’s also no point creating fake ass scenarios that didn’t happen. The Raptors load managed Kawhi for a reason, like it or not. That converted into a championship. The Warriors clearly didn’t manage their players enough that season, resulting in an injury. Maybe the Warriors shouldn’t have needed to spend all their energy beating a CP3less Rockets? Do I need to remind you of the series the Raptors went through to get their Chip? It’s not just about the Finals it’s also about how you got there. Sometimes these things (injuries) can be avoided with the proper measures in place. No one wants to talk about how Kawhi was having a historic post season on a bad leg? How many games did Klay actually miss? Count them. Everyone loves talking about how OP Kevin durant to the Warriors was, the Raptors beat a KDless team and all of a sudden the Raps had the advantage and the Warriors sucked? Klay Thompson played 32+ minutes in 5/6 games of the 2019 NBA Finals. Now tell me, with that information, why do NBA fans want to make it sound like he missed the whole series? Enough with the hypothetical bullshit. The Raptors won that year and they’re in the history books."
"Nah man, we know Klay Thompson has this award on lock."
google klay thompson
Why does that not work both ways though?  “If I could swap out Russell Westbrook and Andre Roberson for Steph Curry and Klay Thompson id be a fool not to try”  They both wanted to play with each other because it gave them a better chance at winning. Both players wanted to stack the deck.
"Yes, you can.  Because they just lost their second best player and are playing at the same level.  We have evidence of what the Warriors look like without Steph *or* Klay.  The Nuggets lost their Klay Thompson and are still mowing down everybody because of Jokic."
Klay Thompson
Best I can do is one used Klay Thompson
"The more I read what you're writing, the more I start to question how well you understand how individual skills and performance add up to wins and losses and championships.  I'm not saying that to antagonize you.  Promise I'm not.  But when you say things like ""If X and Y he would still average over 20ppg"" the alarm bells go off.     That sounds suspiciously like last century thinking.  The goal of the game is not to score 20 points.  The goal is to win.     And then there's this:   &gt;""But he's a top 10 passer, top 15 finisher, top 5 defender, and top 5 downhilll/fastbreak player.  So, l'm sure you can understand my position as well.""   I understand but I don't agree with the premise.  Leaving aside whether I would actually rank him in those spots (I wouldn't), the problem is some of these skills cannot be separated from each other.     In particular, passing is inextricable from scoring threat, which is inextricable from shooting threat.  You may functionally be a good passer, in terms of ability to see passes and make passes, but if you cannot shoot the ball the defense can choose to take away angles while giving up the shot that you cannot make.  No one does this consistently in the regular season but EVERYONE does it consistently in the postseason, which is why players like Simmons and Westbrook and others never have the kind of postseason impact you would expect based on their reputation.       Even Giannis, whom I do consider to be a tier or two above Simmons in terms of physical tools, and certainly an elite player, always looks far more flawed in the playoffs.  Poor shooting also makes everything that teammates try to do more difficult.  A non-shooter is just a massive liability when he doesn't have the ball, and there's only one of those to share among 5 players.  Meanwhile a great shooter makes everything the other players do easier just by existing on the court.       You also have to ask yourself questions of scalability.   E.g., how does this player limit your options for roster construction.  When you have a player like Simmons, it's really REALLY difficult to put him on the floor with other guys who are not shooters, and shooting is the most expensive skill on the market.  (How much did Bertans get as basically a 1-tool player... like $80m or something?  Joe Harris too.  That's the new normal.).   It's much easier and more affordable to have a quality shooter who lacks in other areas as the centerpiece such as Harden, and then fill in his problems with role players (the main one being his lack of lateral defensive quickness).  Another good counterexample is (hypothetically healthy) Klay Thompson, who is basically infinitely scaleable:  30/30 nba teams would take him and he would fit like a glove from day 1.     So when I say Simmons not top 40, this is what I'm talking about.  Imagine an alternate reality where all nba players went back into a pool and the 30 nba teams had to redraft, and the plan was to repeat this draft each season so as not to make decisions based on potential and youth and whatnot.  Under this scenario I would not have Simmons anywhere close to the top of my board because there are too many potential pitfalls with him."
"Presidents are puppets and have no idea what they are talking about BUT, they are people's representatives.  Klay hompson is not and as such should abstain to tell people what to do with their own bodies.  I am not getting vaccinated because i got COVID and i have immunity for a while.  Vaccination does not prevent infection nor does it prevent the spread of the virus. It does greatly prevents harsher consequences.  Knowing this, if COVID was, to me, a 2 days little bother way weaker than many colds  i got along the years, why the f. would i get vaccinated with a rushed product who has already caused hundreds of dead due to it's secondary effects around the world?  You see, Klay Thompson has no clue what he is talking about. He is a puppet repeating what people tells him to.  I would be 100% for the vaccination even with the problems developing in a small minority of people if it would be actually efficient in stopping the infection. But it doesn't. This is established. It only stops most of the bad cases of COVID.  As far as i know i do not need this. My body is young and i am fit. As such, i am not injecting myself and fake immunity when my body still can take care of itself."

You talking about Klay Thompson the kayaker?
Klay Thompson pro air hockey player
Reposting this as an original instead of a reply: One of the most underrated demoralizing shots is Game 6 of the 2016 WCF between Golden State and OKC: Klay Thompson pulling that insane top of the key 3 w/ Russell Westbrook defending him while the Warriors were down and 5 minutes left in the game... that was when he got the playoff record for most 3s in a single game and it is still crazy to watch now
"I don't think why the Warriors suffer in a world with 90's rules. You can't go zone or send super hard doubles against KD or Steph. Now Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Shaun Livingston all get to handcheck on the perimeter? You have to keep in mind as well that KD/Klay/Andre are all very big relative to their position in the 90's."
You think Klay Thompson is a golfer or something?
Klay Thompson DESTROYS Lebron James.
Recovery from injury isn’t PR unless you think he’s faking it. Klay Thompson isn’t giving his publicist a raise because he’s out this year.
we out here doing the klay thompson FT animation every time
"I agree with that. Scoring records =/= championships and Wilt only has 2 of them. I don't think saying that is as nonsensical as you're implying.  &amp;#x200B;  I will admit the generational difference and change in play style, but I will also bring up the fact that the reason for this change in play style is because of Steph Curry himself. Now, its value in this argument relies heavily upon whether you find that important or not, but regardless it is still a factor that needs to be brought up. Additionally, I would argue that this change in play style wouldn't matter at all. Players these days are becoming better and better shooters, and sports technology has also made huge leaps. Honestly I would genuinely argue that he has no ""true competition"" at all. Even his own teammate Klay Thompson who benefits from Steph's gravity ""only"" has 5 such games with 10 or more threes, good for second all time. Steph Curry has 21. Basically what I'm trying to say is: regardless of how good a shooter you were even in the 2000s, even with all the advancements in technology we have now and the shift in emphasis to shooting nowadays, you would still shoot relatively similar to a Joe Harris, Klay Thompson, or Buddy Hield. Nothing to scoff at, for sure: those guys are incredible 3 point shooters. But the bottomline is still there: you will never be Steph Curry."
"If you want to break it down as simple as guys that can shoot, tall guy that score, and big man that plays defense I guess you're squinting your eyeballs out.  Even the warriors system was so simple to recreate every team would try but it isn't.   Seth is a lot closer to a shorter klay thompson without defense than he is to his brother.   Embiid's and Bogut's roles, styles of play, and ability aren't really comparable. Bogut was a solid passing big that played great defense. Embiid is a great defensive big, improving passer, but one of the best scorers in the league.  This also already ignores the fact that the swap doesn't do anything positive for the sixers but replace their non shooting PG for a mediocre shooting pf. He's not going to provide more offense than Ben because that's not his game and never has been. Teams aren't going to stop double teaming Embiid just because Draymond '27% from 3' Green is open the same way they treat him on the warriors now. He isn't a scorer either.  He doesn't improve their defense because it just takes away their best perimeter who also just might be the best perimeter and most versatile defender in the league.   And the playmaking is a wash. Ben is already one of the best playmakers in the league especially in regards to getting his teammates 3pt shots. He was even assisting on more threes than Draymond was on the KD warriors.  All that ignoring age gap and contracts. But go on, please parrot this sentiment that Dray somehow is a better fit and helps this team win this series and the next one."
"Jazz are a fake #1 seed, their entire offense is predicated around the three point shot. Unfortunately there is no Steph Curry or Klay Thompson on that squad to justify the tactic because you guys are gonna lose to LA without Kawhi."
Because he had Klay thompson Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant on his team?
"An athletic Draymond Green just not as strong mentally as Draymond Green in the playoffs. Draymond Green was  in perfect situation with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson with their shooting to provide space for Draymond to set screens over and over (at their peak some said moving screens), rebound, pass the ball, and maybe score to yell ""AND 1"". The scoring is provided by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and later Kevin Durant on offense. In playoffs most of teams are good at finding other team weaknesses and exploiting them until the team can make adjustments. Draymond Green isn't a good scorer, and Warriors were able hide that weakness most of the time where it wouldn't be detrimental."
It's not the posters fault that Jeff Green absorbed Joe Harris's powers and turn into Game 6 Klay Thompson. It was hard to see that coming.

Rondo played an entire quarter on a torn ACL. Klay Thompson was running up and down the court and doing jumping jacks after tearing his.
Watch Ben start shooting like Klay Thompson.
&gt; Klay Thompson is the greatest toasted
"I don't get the circle jerk around hating on AD. Are you mad that he helped Lebron win a ring? Very petty and toxic of you.  All these ""it's a normal basketball play"" arguments are really stupid. For one you fail to mention that players will be less durable playing more games in a condensed schedule with a shorter offseason. So the same harmful plays will be more damaging to players.  You also ignore the fact that having some stars injured increases the work load of the other players on the team, increasing their chance of injury as well. With AD out, Lebron had to play more minutes on the court, putting more of a load on his body, and increasing the odds of him ending up in a dangerous play because he has to do more on the court. Lebron couldn't afford to load manage with AD out, dumbass.  Look at the 2019 Finals, with KD out, the Warriors tried to ball out without him, and Klay Thompson ends up tearing his ACL.  You seem to be happy af about players being injured, especially AD, you're very, very wack my friend."
"Also casual fans think Booker can run an effective offense in crunch time when in reality he struggles a ton doing so. He’s essentially a Klay Thompson type player (instead of threes, Booker does mid range jumpers) who excels at getting the ball in movement and then either attacking the rim or taking a jumper. Booker is not a point guard and cannot be trusted to run an offense in crunch time."
Klay Thompson is the greatest toaster handler of all time
Klay Thompson tore his Achilles before the season started. Considering they almost made it to the playoffs I'd count that injury as well.
"If it is a confirmed tear that requires surgery to repair it, he'll probably miss next season, right? [Klay Thompson had surgery to repair his torn ACL on July 2nd of 2019](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1146171073358127104?s=19) and he missed the whole next season recovering from it."
klay thompson got a double whammy too.

"Yeah Klay Thompson was a freak accident, quite literally. He took his time and hurt himself in the process of coming back testing himself in a scrimmage, seems unfair to bring up."
&gt;	We saw what happened with Klay Thompson. If you try to rush him back he will most likely re-injure himself.  ???
"How does wade on a team that wasnt making the playoffs + bosh compare to a 2time MVP, soon-to-be-dpoy in draymond, klay fucking thompson, and a 73-9 team that has made two finals + a chip in experience??? Think bro"
Okay clown continue to watch this playoffs. When it's all said and done KD will have 3+ FMVP's and in 10 years nobody is going to give a crap if he played with Klay Thompson LOL
"CP3 spits in Rondo's face, then proceeds to destroy KD in the finals. Harden pulls a Klay Thompson. Sub hails CP3 as the new basketball god.  GUARANTEED"
"2017 Warriors are the GOAT NBA team. Kevin Durant is over there, maybe the best 1v1 scorer in NBA history. You stopped him? Okay. There's Steph Curry running around, the best shooter in NBA history, the most dangerous off-ball player in NBA history, and an elite 1v1 creator off the dribble. The two best pure scorers of the 2010s. Pick your poison. You somehow locked them both down? Okay, cool. There's Klay Thompson, the best catch-and-shooter in NBA history, sitting on the elbow, waiting for the pass. And on the other end he's locking you down with Iguodala and Draymond Green, a DPOY/serial 1st-team All-Defense.   Just an absurd, all-time great, totally unfair team."
"You might not think it, but pre-injury Klay Thompson would probably be problematic for KD. Excellent lateral movement, and smart BBIQ"
Jeff green turned into klay Thompson
I didn't see Harden playing to give them another ballhandler &amp; Jeff Green morphing into Klay Thompson.
im more mad at bud for keeping brook in when Jeff Green turned into Klay mother fucking Thompson
"Did not get the job done? What do you want him to do, drop 100 points like Wilt? It's not his fault that Bud let KD destroy Lopez a million straight plays. It's not his fault Jeff Green turned into Klay Thompson. He dropped 34/14/4 and played great help defense. That's about as much as you can ask out of anyone."
trade giannis for klay thompson
"did you miss the part when he said when on fire? i disagree though, klay thompson is my on fire GOAT"
"Jeff ""Klay Thompson"" Green"
Blowing a 17 point lead + Jeff Green turning into a better Klay Thompson is gonna be one of the worst playoff losses in recent memory  The part where KD is carrying hard isn't as bad
Jeff green clearly being possessed by the spirit of klay thompson
Joe Harris went from Klay Thompson to Grayson Allen real quick when he was asked to be the 3rd option
Still can’t believe KD compared Joe Harris to Klay Thompson.
I never want to hear Harris mentioned in the same sentence as Klay Thompson again
A loss might end the Bucks franchise not sure you recover from losing because Jeff Green turns into Klay Thompson
"I have a fresh plate of cookies for the person who said Joe Harris is like Klay Thompson, come and get them!!"

Bruh. Green looking like Klay Thompson out here.
I thought he was the next Klay Thompson?
"Yeah, Klay Thompson syndrome. Where he misses part of a series so people just pretend he never existed at all. Had a whole big thing, you must have missed it."
WHITE KLAY THOMPSON COME ON BABY
"As weird as this may sound, I'll never be sad if klay ""the god"" Thompson does well. He's by far my favorite player in the league, (mad slept on by casuals) and I would want nothing but to see him succeed."
and harden had a far better season than klay thompson in 2016 but was snubbed because people dont like him

The second person they threw out was Klay Thompson. I think they care a little too much about championships.
"I might get castrated by the fan base for this, but maybe you take a gamble and do Embiid and Danny Green for Klay Thompson, James Wiseman, Minny 1st this year (probably 4th overall) and the Warriors pick (probably 14th overall)?"
He plays more like a Klay Thompson on both ends
“I’m sweating a little bit coach. Gonna have to rely on Steph Curry and Klay Thompson for a bit here.”
LeBron did nothing of the sort. Love lost weight and was never the same player like he was in Minnesota. Dude couldn't even post up Klay Thompson lmao  And what were Bosh's and Love's stats when he left? Surely they should have returned their former selves if he was holding them back
Terrible idea. Wasn't it a hamstring injury that Klay Thompson had which caused him to blow his ACL playing on it? Hamstring is one of the main muscles that protects the ACL.
"Andre Iguodala said Utah can “lull you to sleep” and make you think, “Man, let's just get out of here. '” Matt Barnes said “There's no nightlife in Utah.”  When asked about those comments later Klay Thompson said ""Boring people get bored."""
"&gt;He cheated on his ex girlfriend who was Doc Rivers daughter, got a stripper pregnant, wanted an abortion, didn’t get it, so he ended up tying the knot.  Yet there's murals of Kobe painted all over LA. I'm sure that must be because of his spotless personal life, right?  Anyone wanna guess how Magic got HIV but his wife didn't?   Barkley got caught with a prostitute, is he hated for that? Is Wade hated for having a kid with another woman while he was married?  Klay Thompson got caught in bed with another woman, but ""weed toaster lol.""  &gt; was apart of many horrendous losses, including the infamous 3-1 comeback from the nuggets. Which PG shot a corner 3 that hit nothing but the side of the backboard.   Curry gave up a 3-1 lead after winning unanimous MVP, and got locked up by Kevin Love. He must be hated by r/NBA for that, I'm sure.  And Luka just gave up a 2-0 lead to ""Playoff P."" I'm sure he's now hated too."
"Harris needs to play like Klay Thompson, Blake needs to lock up Giannis."

"The problem is that it doesn't selectively apply to any year, but is a recurring theme, so it needs to be discounted. There have been major injuries changing the playoff landscape in most recent years.   * 2020 Lakers - Bam, Jimmy, and Dragic all get injured in the first half of game 1.  * 2019 Raptors - Kevin Durant plays 12 minutes in the finals before his Achilles explodes. Klay Thompson misses time an eventually loses his ACL in game 6. Joel Embiid also has a mysterious illness in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals. * 2018 Warriors - Chris Paul's hamstring explodes in the Western Conference finals. * 2017 Warriors - The Warriors zaza Kawhi after getting blownout in game 1 of the WCF. * 2016 Cavs - Draymond gets suspended for caressing LeBron's testicle zone and Andrew Bogut breaks his leg. * 2015 Warriors - Kyrie Irving's knee cap breaks in game 1 of the finals and Kelly Olynyk breaks Kevin Love's shoulder. * 2014 Spurs - Our last real champions."
"The man who said there’s a Klay Thompson every draft night, and that Kevin Love is a once in a generation player has power over Carlisle?"
Ginger Klay Thompson
What am I reading? Klay Thompson averages only 3ppg less over his career but is much more efficient and plays better defence than Devin could dream of. Steph is an underrated defender but a Booker/Steph back court would be a defensively liability. Klay’s ability to give u an efficient 20ppg without needing the ball and play both ends at an elite levels meshes with Curry way better than D book would.
"why not add in Klay Thompson and Draymond Green while youre at it? But why stop there!? Let's fill out our bench with Jrue, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, AD, and Valencunias?"
Is it really that much different from the Raptors ring? KD didn’t play and Klay Thompson got hurt as well
Why? Because the Clippers you *clearly* dislike so much might win it all? Does the Raptors championship deserve an asterisk over it too cause Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson got injured?
"After what happened to Klay Thompson, why in the world would the Nets put any of their Big Three at risk?"
"You'lll have a bunch of people coming in to hear themselves talk for the sake of disagreeing, but you are very correct, forcing teams to win a perimeter game with a center is what you want to do.  Dare Simmons and Embiid to shoot all day while giving Curry the Klay Thompson treatment."
Then you get guys like klay Thompson born as son of nba player who had it easy : I mean it’s not always hardest road and that’s fine.
"why do people have the need to automatically stick negative labels on players in bad situations the moment they get any attention?    to me, it's lazy analysis and lazy media. the pure analytics people who only look at numbers all day to make their narratives because it's faster VS the people who are willing to look at film and numbers so that they understand the context and impact.    As for Monta, I think GSW did him a disservice with the teams they built around him. Also, most of the shit he got was because his numbers dipped a little when he went to a worse Milwaukee team with no spacing while GSW got better when one of the greatest shooters of all time was forced to take more shots and rookie klay Thompson got the opportunity to play through his mistakes and show what he can do.    If Monta was traded to a team that fit him better like to the Grizzlies as a SG or the Clippers as a backup guard, his reputation would be completely different. And it's the same for Booker. The dude had over 5 coaches and 120+ different teammates in 5 years. Out of all those teammates there's maybe 10 that are still in the league and none of them are doing great.    If someone makes a reasonable negative take on a player on my team, that's fine. but when it's clearly just lazy analysis that they spent maybe 5 minutes on, that's what gets me heated."
Its a weird year. You had the top heavy Nets and the injured ass lakers and the rest of the contenders are all pretty evenly matched. I just imagine what Klay Thompson would have meant to GS this year.
"What a pointless exercise. This list is only good for one day, it would change after tonight’s games.  LeBron is 7th so one assumes Bill is judging on health, since a healthy Lebron should be higher. But then he goes ahead and ranks Klay Thompson 29?  This is just so classic 2021 Extreme Hot Take Ringer Bill. Dude changes his opinion every 5 minutes. The only way to enjoy the Sportish Guy anymore is to roast his takes hard, which is what we do over at r/billsimmons (and how I found this).  OP, good job by you!"
"Well even looking at the list.   Kemba at 9 - he was coming off a great NCAA career but was a very undersized player for the NBA  Klay Thompson - great shooter/3&amp;D wing but this was before the 3 point explosion. Was tough to predict his value exploding like it did. Also a 3 year college player   Kawhi - played at a small school and couldn’t shoot really. Improved an insane amount in the NBA  Jimmy Butler - went from being a PF in college to a skilled guard in the NBA. Came into the NBA as a raw hustle player. Had multiple MIP caliber seasons after he was drafted.   Vuc - 3 year player. Was a seen as a decent pick, but there were younger bigs who looked more promising (Kanter, JV, Biyombo, Thompson).  Hindsight makes evaluating players a lot easier, but at the time a lot of these guys had reasons for not being considered better, and some of it was related to the league changing, some was related to players improving a lot after they made the league."
"It was literally just two years ago the Toronto Raptors went up against a Golden State team with Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson injured out of the series. Two years ago. Nowadays, no one really brings up that injury fact besides Warrior fans.  At the end of the day, trolls who will harp on these things, bringing up asterisks will just move because they'll notice people stop caring and harp about the next bullshit they can go off about that day."
Watch me stan:  Golden State:  Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson is the definition of a star role player.
Davis [also said](https://twitter.com/ClutchPointsApp/status/1356395613940715520) that Klay Thompson getting hurt was karma.  He's always been a [piece of shit](https://streamable.com/ox9j60).

Jackson fought with his assistants, terrible relationship with the front office, tried pitying players against each other “to create motivation”. No hyperbole, people just never watched the warriors team with Jackson as coach and let the media narrative dictate it since he’s good friends with ABC execs and other talking heads ."
"&gt;I don’t think they come close to winning that title without AD.  You're wrong.  &gt;None of them are good enough to be the second best player on a championship team in lebrons window  James has won with less.  &gt;Those kids the Lakers traded aren’t Steph and Klay.  That was just one of many such examples.  The point which just zoomed over your head is that if you trade every young player because they haven't accomplished anything yet, you will be sorry.  That said, the next time Thompson averages more points per game than Ingram has the past two seasons, will be the first.  &gt;IMO you are overrating BI,Ball and Hart. They are (currently) not the players to bring you a title.  Again, James has won with less.  More to the point, you are typically uninformed, as I suspected, even though I invited you to do some research before making a dumb reply.  You are failing to consider the breadth of that trade, and the other options.  Since I've had to explain this to dozens of similarly-ignorant people, I will just cut-and-paste here.  James/Ball/Ingram/Kuzma/Zubac with Hart, Caldwell-Pope, Caruso, Green, Howard, McGee, Rondo, Hunter, and Wagner is by-far the deepest team last year, and would've had a very good chance to win. Certainly no one in the West beats them. Miami would've had a chance.      Not only that, but they could've traded for, say, Jimmy Butler instead of Davis. Butler was traded for peanuts, in comparison, and James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac and some of that bench wins easily in 2020.  In this case, the Lakers retain substantially all of the assets they spent to rent Davis.      With Bradley during the regular season, that Laker bench alone is a playoff team in the East, and James has won titles with far less than the team they'd have had without Davis."
"NBA guys can shoot the lights out, literally. Theres a great sports science video of Klay Thompson shooting threes in the dark. These guys shoot off of muscle memory, blocking their vision when they’ve already started shooting won’t do much.  A quality nba contest will change the shot motion, either by rushing it or forcing the offensive player to shoot around or above the contest. Anything else at that level is just cosmetic."
Y’all ever heard of klay Thompson
This is his problem he needs to stay aggressive. A lot of nights he just turns into another 3&amp;D guy out there and for what he is making you need him to Klay Thompson for it to be worth it.
"Ok so I see a lot of people here thinking ""why don't they try and block shot"" or, ""cover their eyes so they cant see the rim"" like OP. First and foremost, contesting a shot at any level at it's core is not to block eyesight or block their shot, it's to alter their shot. These are guys who have practiced shooting millions of times, at different angles and with different pressure on them. A hand in the face is not going to do anything to the likes of klay thompson, steph or any other shooter. They know their release point, they know where the basket is, it's all about feel at this level in the game. You need to contest the shot where you feel they have to adjust or alter their shot. If they do this, then you've did your job as a defender.  See Bruce Bowen, his main way of contesting was making shooters think about where to put their feet after a shot less they get a career ending injury..."

"You're not addressing 2016 at all. Westbrook played like shit games 5-7, but KD had multiple opportunities to close out the series and solidify himself.    A 2017 Cavs-Warriors rematch would've been near even. The Cavs lacked defense, and they wouldn't have blown out the Warriors if they didn't have KD. OKC would've had the same assets to make a trade for Oladipo/Sabonis and flip for PG AND get Al Horford. A lineup up Westbrook/KD/PG/Adams/Horford would absolutely be a contender. 2019 would've been won if Klay Thompson didn't get injured at all even with KD out. 30 points in 30 minutes in game 6 about to force a game 7? Come on, how are you going to call yourself a Warriors fan when you don't even give credit to your own team."
Steph Curry. Can't get his team to the playoffs himself. An All Star but no superstar top 5 player the league makes him out to be. I would take Klay Thompson over him. More well rounded player.

"&gt; Why y'all sleeping on Klay Thompson?  Nobody's sleeping on Klay, it's the NBA finals, we don't care right now"
what do you want people to say or do different from what they're doing now? Threads about Klay Thompson probably getting to play next season when this year's Finals isn't even over? foh
Did Klay Thompson die?  He was the best sg in the NBA before he got injured. The disrespect on this sub is outrageous.
Klay Thompson and Draymond Green can shut him down on a double team
You're Klay Thompson?
"Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Donavan Mitchell, Kwahi Leonard, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, Joel Embiid, Trae Young, Jaylon Brown, Kemba Walker, James Harden, Kyrie Irving"
"It does to some extent. Speaking as someone who has only torn their ACL, there are three things impacted. The third one is often neglected post clearance or not often noticed if it isn't obvious.   * Muscle strength - Getting the quad, hamstring, hips, glutes, etc. to their original level.  * Flexibility - Same as above.  * Mechanics - How you walk, run, bend your knees. Making sure everything is in sync.  That third point...if you don't pay attention to and don't do it right can result in either side of your body having to rely on certain muscles or tendons to compensate. For me, because my left leg was initially weaker after surgery, I started leaning more on my right leg, causing one hip to drop more than the other. That led to my upper body leaning one way when I sit, resulting in my left side tightening up from my core to my hips. My left glute was also not activating as much, which is meant to help stabilize every step you take, resulting in more muscle weakness and risk of injury.   So even though he was ""medically"" cleared, that simply means that the ACL graft is structurally sound and the surrounding muscles are strong enough to withstand intense pressure from the sport. Assuming he was cleared by a MD, they wouldn't look at your walking pattern or gait. That's something a PT would assess and a lot of PTs do miss that bit, because these changes can be really small. Everything from how your foot lands with each step, if your knee is straight with your toes, if you're using your hips to take the stress off the knee with each step, etc. etc.  This is all speculation, but given how he tore his [achilles](https://thespun.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/klay-thompson-explains-torn-achilles-injury-cause) on a two dribble pull up, I imagine it was due to a mix of fatigue and over compensation from his right leg, given it's the stronger one."
"klay thompson fans are always the most lame insufferable individuals ever lmfao..  ""muh weed smonk klay"""
Ray Allen is a much better shooter because he's proven he could be a number 1 option on good teams. Klay Thompson is great but he benefits from playing next to the greatest shooter of all time.
"You could make a case for Klay Thompson, but he has had the benefit of playing next to the greatest shooter of all time in Steph Curry and his massive offball gravity.   Ray Allen could create shots better but Klay is a better catch and shoot type player."
"Ray Allen did it without Curry next to him. Ray Allen also revolutionized the spot up shooter game and is #1 currently. Teams didn't shoot as many 3s in that era also. Curry is #1 because like he blew up the NBA, Can shoot from anywhere on the court off the dribble, redefined gravity in basketball basically. With 3 pointers it's not going to be possible to compare numbers fairly very quickly. There isn't really a real answer because KD, Larry Bird, Reggie Miller, Damian Lillard, Dirk, and Pistol Pete all played in different eras and if you left them open they were knocking the shot down from 3, but like not all of those guys shot 6-8+ 3s per game, shit Pistol Pete was famous for shooting past the 3 point line well before the 3 point line, in college. Like to say that this person hit more 3s in a season in less attempts and say that's the reason that he's better than Ray Allen who started his career 25 years before Klay Thompson won his first championship leaves out the era, the defense faced, the role in the offense, who he was playing next to, the system itself."
Klay Thompson for POGCHAMPS
Cavs 3rd Star was Kevin Love. Warriors have Klay fucking Thompson. Steph Curry was a 2x MVP. Kyrie has never even been in MVP discussion ever.   What a dumbass opinion
Draymond 100% eh? But Klay Thompson is 99%?
Klay Thompson said the best or second best player of all time wasn't a man and then got beaten while up 3-1
"If this was NBA2k and we turned off injuries, the Warriors don't win the 2015 NBA finals and who knows what happens with Durant. LeBron James would have become a dynasty winning 3 out of 4 (12,13,15).  I don't understand why people say the Warriors got robbed in 2016, while ignoring 2015. Honestly, those 2 seasons couldn't have played out any better because they got Durant and 2 more rings out of that loss.  Also, Klay Thompson didn't get to sign a supermax because salty voters with Warrior's fatigue didn't put him into the all-nba team. This has yet to pay dividends, but it could starting next season. Or maybe it has already hurt the Warriors because they used the MLE and injury exception last season to try and chase another playoff run and it cost them draft position."
"so i guess he thinks jr smith is somehow comparable to klay thompson? lol.. i'll give KD this, he's excellent at trolling people"
That 2017 cavs team was really good. 2017 and 2018 warriors are up there for best team of all time though. 2 MVP’s in their prime with a DPOY and Klay freaking Thompson. And they were well coached. Insane
Let's just look at the names:  Lebron James vs Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving vs Steph Curry  Kevin Love vs Klay Thompson  JR Smith vs Draymond Green  Tristan Thompson vs Andre Iguodala   Does that look even top to bottom?
"Is there chemistry issues at Golden State??? Klay Thompson allegedly ""sick of [Draymond Green]."""
"Perfectly even matchup, top to bottom. Korver and Klay are basically the spiderman pointing meme, KD and Tristan Thompson both went to University of Texas, so they're also the same player pretty much."
"‘Similar production’ doesn’t matter, we’re just talking about which team had the better players.   Imagine how good the Cavs would’ve been if they had Draymond Green and Klay Thompson instead of Kevin freakin Love lol"
"I have the same chess set as Klay Thompson, so I got that going for me."
"Wojanrowski: Draymond Green (fractured cock) will miss the entirety of the 2021-22 NBA season. “He should’ve taken en passant,” says teammate Klay Thompson."
"I follow chess and basketball. They are my things. From everything I know, Magnus is a real cool dude on top of being and the greatest chess player to ever play. He'll crack beers while live streaming his online games. There's a documentary about him, which is worth a watch.  Relatedly, Klay Thompson seems like a super cool dude, too."
Klay Thompson  Jrue is the better defender though
Dang...Klay Thompson has an 1800 rating on [chess.com](https://chess.com)  https://www.chess.com/member/doctor\_seuss
i never used to be a klay thompson man but this shit is hilarious lolol. what is he just spending his days riding around the bay in his boat just geeking and chilling? lolol shit the bay is beautiful so if i had money like that i'd probably be doing the same.
Klay Thompson is an American treasure
"I hate to break this news to you if you weren't aware, but yeah, Klay Thompson has died (in the conversation for best backcourt). He last played a game on June 13, 2019. It is now July 2021."
We all wish we were Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson is a cool dude.
"When I grow up, I want to be Klay Thompson."
Name something this sub loves more than Klay Thompson.  Note: Shitting on Kevin Durant is excluded from this.
"Undisputed: ""Klay Thompson on his IG live claimed Draymond Green had been cheating his money. Is this a sign that the Warriors franchise is crumbling and does it mean that the Lakers have a serious chance of signing Steph Curry?"""
"Yeah, I am still a big Jimmy Butler fan. Ironically Middleton is exactly the type of player you'd want to pair him with -- someone who can score on or off ball, but doesn't need to have the ball all the time.  Middleton's skill type is rare, that's why he's so valuable. Klay Thompson, Paul George, Brad Beal -- there's not a ton of guys like that. Sometimes it's harder to find a great #2 guy than a #1."
"No, that's (in reality) Steph Curry and Klay Thompson."
"Same reason people shit on Steph Currys defense, he played with a DPOY who is able to guard 1-5, Klay Thompson who is borderline all defense second team and KD who is a 7fter that moves like a guard"
Game 1 was an in between played like healthy Klay Thompson.
Since when did Connaughton become Klay Thompson?
Tanned Klay Thompson
Yeah and Klay Thompson flaunting his boat is so funny right?  Lol you people.
Dude Middleton is so crazy. He can be absolute trash then catch fire like klay thompson.
Klay Thompson wearing 24 for the Bucks today I guess
Crowder goes from Klay Thompson to Ricky Rubio in one quarter.
"&gt;He's actually proven he is capable of creating his own shots when Steph has been out in the past. He doesn't shoot at quite the same clip, but he was still an above average shooter.  Klay Thompson in 90 games without Steph Curry averaged 18.9/3.2/2.3 on 43.8/38.7/84.5. Wonderful numbers for a max player.   &gt; He may not be able to create shots for other players off the dribble, but he is a huge threat as a shooter so you can't just leave him alone in the corner.  Not sure what him being a threat has to do with his complete lack of playmaking.  &gt;His lowest eFG in the last 4 years was in 19-20 and was 0.516. That is far from inefficient.  Klay Thompson didn't play in 19-20. And if you're talking about the 2018-2019 season, the league average EFG was 52.4%. I can't fathom how someone could be considered one of the best shooters in history, play alongside two of the greatest offensive players in history, and still have below average efficiency in shooting. Klay Thompson is by far the most overrated player in the league."
"Klay Thompson pre-injury was probably one of the 10 worst players in the NBA to have a max contract. He doesn't create his own shot, he can't create shots for other players, is a bad off ball defender, and despite playing alongside the greatest shooter of all time, has not that great efficiency. And this was before he sat out for two years from tearing his ACL and Achilles. You're delusional if you think he has positive value on that contract."
"Okay. I mean, I don't know if Lakers would actually trade Kuzma and KCP and stuff for Klay Thompson, but it's a viable opinion."
"This thread shows me how dumb this sub can really be sometimes. Klay Thompson as a negative asset, or they'd have to throw in pick 7 just to get off of his contract? Ha!  I understand that he's coming off of two potentially devastating injuries, but he's still Klay Thompson. He's not KD, but KD signed a full max and all 30 teams would've given him the same deal. 30 teams out there would pay Klay his current contract, so he clearly has value.  Now, of course his value isn't as high as it was in 2018, but to imply he's a negative asset now is asinine."
"No  Warriors will not trade Klay Thompson unless Steph Curry leaves, and Steph Curry is not leaving"
Zach LaVine and Mikal Bridges join Anthony Davis on the Lakers to form a superteam  At least one team gets relocated  Trae Young wins MVP  Kings don't make the playoffs and hit a 20 year streak  Klay Thompson retires  LaMelo becomes a top 3 PG   Embiid wins an MVP  The NBA expands by two teams  The Nets don't win a championship  *Champions:*  2021- Bucks  2022- Nuggets  2023- 76ers  2024- Lakers  2025- Lakers
We must protect Klay Thompson at all costs.
"Isn’t a super team 3+ star players? Like the Nets, or when KD was on the Warriors.  Kevin Durant + Kyrie Irving + James Harden  Stephen Curry + Klay Thompson + Kevin Durant.  I’m not referring to the Clippers here, but some 2 star player teams do give the definition a run for its money though."
His current game incorporates equal amounts of in all and offball movements. And among superstars he is one of the few that actually relocates.  who is a actually the greatest offball scorer in your mind?  Reggie Miller? Klay Thompson?
"Even back in 2013 and 2014 though, when those YouTube videos were made, he was never the worst defender. He got caught ball watching sometimes, which was a bad habit, but other guys just get bullied every possession and are worse defenders than a guy who falls asleep on the backdoor every few games. So it was still really cherry picked, it just was also a bit of an egregious issue. It wasn't like Harden was out there every play just getting diced up. On the entire night, his lapses didn't negatively affect us.  It's also important to note that McHale severly misused Harden. He wanted him to run around screens and chase Klay Thompson all game. Harden's a unique dude who can read passing lanes like a beast and can hold his own in the paint. Any decent coach can work with that, but McHale had no real concept of coaching to his player's strengths."
What's your definition of reliable scorer? I'm not saying he's Klay Thompson but Wiggins did put up 18+ ppg. That ain't too shabby.
"Gravity is the catch word, some folks on this sub swear that every shot a teammate of Steph hits, it's because of Steph's ""gravity"". They casually forget that Steph also plays with a guy that is at worst a Top 5 shooter ever and that his former teammate in Kevin Durant was also a 40% 3-PT shooter.  None of that was based in any evidence aswell, as Steph got more wide open shots in the regular season and playoffs than KD did during their run.  Steph is the greatest shooter ever, but people act like the difference between him and Klay Thompson is some gigantic shit, Klay legit beat Steph in a 3-PT contest before AND shoots almost the same percentage. Anyone that thinks that James Harden and Dame haven't been defended the same way Steph gets defended, is clueless."
"I'm not a Curry stan and I'm not going down the rabbit hole of reading whatever Twitter arguments were being made... but based solely on the headline I saw on some other post about how ""nobody faced defense like Steph Curry""... I don't think it's that outlandish to agree with that sentiment.  That's not to say that other guys like Harden haven't faced swarms of bodies or to say Steph faced harder defenses or anything like that, but I think Steph's situation was a little unique. With Harden in Houston, he didn't have a Klay Thompson-like threat playing beside him every night, so obviously teams could risk doubling Harden a little harder.  But what makes Steph so different is his constant movement off the ball. Nobody has defenses scrambling to communicate off-ball switches more than Steph (or trying to figure out ways to slow him down without the refs calling it)"
"&gt; kd joined a 73-9 team. Not solely because of steph  This skirts around the fact that Steph is the reason they were 73-9. Replace Steph with any other point guard and that's an 8th seed team. The dude averaged 30ppg on 50/45/90 and hardly played any 4th quarters. If Steph wasn't on that team literally no one would have been mad about KD joining.  It's funny to me how every other superstar in the league gets singled out in discussions about their teams success. Like ""Lebron beat the Warriors."" ""Harden led his team to 60 wins."" Russ led his team to the playoffs without KD."" Etc. But when it comes to Steph's accomplishments it's the team.   &gt;kd wasn’t also playing next to arguably the second best shooter of all time in klay Thompson.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/warriors-record-without-steph-curry-with-durant-and-klay"
Kd wasn’t allowed to be ranked above lebron because kd joined a 73-9 team. Not solely because of steph like kd wasn’t also playing next to arguably the second best shooter of all time in klay Thompson.
They don't have a Klay thompson yet. Reddish is nice though
Who's Klay Thompson on the Hawks?
Klay Thompson people really think him coming back is going to be the get to a Warriors comeback.
"I'll start with mine:  Klay Thompson, although a good player, is way more inconsistent than people tend to think and often gets a pass simply because of how good his team was   In the ENTIRE 2017 playoffs, he averaged 15 ppg on 51% TS  But because of how dominant GSW were, the games where he disappeared were always forgotten and only the games where he went off get remembered   I'll finish by saying that most casuals probably think he was/is better than Draymond on those teams, which I really just don't see"
Klay (A Movie Star) Thompson
and? KD was chillin for almost two years due to injury + pandemic and yet he got the bag. plenty of teams would kill for klay thompson injuries and all.
"Played against Klay Thompson at WSU the year before he was drafted. He would basically just walk around stoned and nail every single shot   Chill guy, but it was so frustrating to guard. He could beat anyone without even trying"
Players with 3 rings and a gold medal:  Bill Russell  KC Jones  Michael Jordan  Scottie Pippen  Kobe Bryant  Magic Johnson  Many Ginobili  Lebron James  Larry Bird  Draymond Green  Klay Thompson  Dwayne Wade  Steph Curry (if US wins gold)  Javale McGee (if US wins gold)  Javale is joining an elite club lol
It's possible Klay Thompson is the worst contract in the league. Like John wall level bad.
Klay Thompson is basically a meme at this point.
I was excited when Josh Smith went to Detroit  I actually love that both Lebron and Jordan had to beat Detroit to meet their greatness.  After an argument with a friend I think maybe he’s right that Reggie Miller &gt; Klay Thompson
"I think he's good enough, on a vet min, for any team. Especially, a team that has his childhood friend Klay Thompson"
Klay Thompson is a gift.
Klay Thompson turned out to be a much cooler dude than I thought. Can Warriors fans clarify if he just had a self realization of sorts during his injury or did he always had such a fun personality?
"I did not foresee a future in which the a global pandemic would happen, the Olympics would get delayed a year because of it, Klay Thompson would tear his Achilles after recovering and rehabbing from his ACL injury, and this would affect both the Warriors and possibly Team USA's personnel issues (both Klay and Steph would probably play in this Olympics)."
"Kobe was alway surrounded with more talent than LeBron. Remember Bron was relegated to Cleveland for 6 or 7 seasons before he was surrounded by stars. Kobe won 3 rings with SHAQUILLE ONEAL (an undeniable top 10 and arguable top 5 all time NBA talent) for many seasons. LeBron never had that caliber of teammate until Miami. So LeBron with a young Shaq or LeBron with Gasol/Fisher/ Bynum in their prime might have yielded even better results as LeBron is historically durable. Kobe had injuries that kept him out of entire seasons. That never happened with peak LeBron. Anyone expecting him to Beat curry/KD/klay Thompson without a fully healthy Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love is smoking crack. It’s not a apples to apples comparison because without Shaq, Kobe only has 2 rings. It’s not just Kobe’s mentality to netted him 5 rings he played with elite athletes and was coached by Phil jackson. 2 undeniable variables that can’t be understated and 2 factors LeBron didn’t have until year 7 or 8 in the league. That’s a long time to be losing in the playoffs by yourself. Such was not the case for Kobe."
Klay Thompson is a proud chocolate milkman. It fuels his workouts.
Waiting on my Klay Thompson flair.

"Wiggins is an *elite* defender. He was second *in the NBA* on opponent FG% and can guard 1 through 5.  Klay Thompson does actually handle the ball sometimes on the second unit, Jordan Poole is improving, and we still have both Steph and Draymond."
"We're hoping to add Klay Thompson to the roster, we think he's pretty good"
"My friend saying we should've drafted Dante Exam over Joel Embiid on draft night  My roommates dad saying three months ago we should keep Ben Simmons and trade Embiid  ESPN ranking Bam Adebayo over Joel Embiid less than a year ago  Paul Pierce saying he was a better perimeter shooter than Klay Thompson is  On r/sixers last off-season I was downvoted for saying Devin Booker is better than Ben Simmons. Their reasoning for why Ben is better was literally just that he plays defense  My GFs brother, a Mavericks fan, saying at the time of trade that they got the better player in the Josh Richardson/Seth Curry trade  My friend draft night saying that Luka Doncic was gonna bust"

"Everyone is correctly noting that the average male is 5’9 200, but you gotta take the fact that he’s 55 years old into account as well.   At that age and weight, he may well have serious mobility problems. Even if he’s only cherry-picking, he’s likely going to get too injured to cherry pick at some point just from running to get out of the players’ way. And any reasonably hard contact with an NBA player could very easily end his season. No team doctor worth his salt is going to let this obese old man on the court — physically, he’s in much worse shape than Klay Thompson was last season, for example."

"It's crazy that since then Ray Allen's record has been surpassed by Duncan Robinson, Damian Lillard (2x), Buddy Hield (3x), Klay Thompson and James Harden (2x). And then there's Steph, who's done it 6 times."
"I wouldn't say Marcus Smart making All Defense is that outlandish.  I'm gonna go off the rails and list my hot prediction takes for next season.  - 50% chance Westbrook will get traded in a blockbuster at the deadline for a 3P shooter if they're struggling during the regular season.  - The other 50% chance being the Lakers get eliminated in quarter finals again due to a combination of injuries, LeBron getting older and their lack of shooters if Westbrook doesn't get traded.  - The Bulls will make a convincing playoff run and be on the verge of eliminating a contender team in the semis, only to be reverse eliminated due to a heart breaking injury to one of DeRozan or Lavine at the worst timing possible.  - SGA will make All NBA third team.  - Kuzma will change his reputation and breakout as Washington's no 1 option. However, Washington doesn't make the playoffs.  - Klay Thompson will suffer another debilitating injury when he comes back, this time will be career threatening.  - Isaiah Thomas will be signed to a 10 day contract late in the season from a team decimated by injuries and proceed to still do nothing noteworthy.  - Jalen Suggs will emerge as the ROTY. Cade will have played better, but is ineligible due to injuries keeping him out of too many games.  - A package surrounding Ben Simmons will be eventually traded for CJ McCollum midway through the season, despite both front offices vehemently denying they're shopping either of them the entire time up to the trade.  - Donovan Mitchell will request a trade by the end of the season if the Jazz don't make it to the WCF at minimum."

yeah when they first started teams could not keep up at all and one of them always had an open shot on every possession. Klay would have like 5ft of open space. Klay Thompson shooting was your best hope. lol

It’s Klay Thompson. You also get defense.
"With minimum 100 games played, its Draymond Green and Klay Thompson - Win% 69.9, GP: 123   Minimum 150 games played, it's Dennis Rodman - Win% 68.6, GP: 169  Minimum 200 games played, it's LeBron, with Scottie Pippen also having a 65.4% win rate"
I can't see him being the player he once was after 2 of the most horrific injuries a pro basketball player can get. Hopefully he can still contribute in the league but he will most likely look like Kyle Korver then klay thompson.

"1.	Robert Covington, Klay Thompson, Joe Harris, OG Anunoby, and Mikal Bridges are both better 3 point shooters and better defenders than Lonzo 2.	He has never impacted the defense like an elite option has before. Sure, hes a good defender, but Jrue Holiday is so many tiers above him and didn’t get a defensive award in 2020. Why would the Pels get such a terrible defensive rating on the perimeter if Lonzo was actually “elite”. 3.	He is not an elite playmaker in the half court. In fact, he his below average for a point guard. There’s a reason he was relegated to 3&amp;D over fucking Eric Bledsoe. He doesn’t have handles and cannot create his own shot. He was the secondary playmaker when Jrue started as SG. 4.	please tell me how he’ll be better than Zach Lavine, DeRozan, Lowry, Kyrie, Simmons, Beal, LaMelo, Trae, Harden, Butler, Garland, Sexton, etc to get an all star vote. Especially since he’s the 4th best player on his team"

"Forward: Klay Thompson + Tacko Fall, spot up shooting with that height would break the game. Guard: Simmons + Steph. Center: KAT + Dray"
"This. Kevin Durant's return from his Achilles injury is insanity. A 31 year old suffered the worst injury a basketball player can suffer, an injury that has been the career-destroyer for so many great players, and he came back, and when he came back, he wasn't just an all-star, he was still KD, still able to do what he was able to do before on that same level.  Barring some insanity from Klay Thompson this upcoming season, it's the greatest injury comeback in NBA history. No one in the sport has ever suffered an injury that severe at such a high level of play and came back and was still at that level."
Imagine in the modern era Klay Thompson being your 4th best player
"Klay Thompson doesn’t jump you 2 spots in the west, let alone 5"
"Guard: Magic Johnson (Passing, Scoring, BBIQ) + Klay Thompson (Defense, Shooting)   Forward: Larry Bird (Passing, scoring, BBIQ) + Giannis (Size, Athleticism, Defense)  Center: Kareem (Scoring, defense) + Jokic (Passing, shooting)"
"Duncam Robinson's a role player. I said it earlier, players who have money jumpers but no dribbling or off ball skills are roleplayers. And yeah, If Klay Thompson turns into Duncan Robinson that would still be terrible news for the Warriors brass in more ways than one."
Wheelchair Klay Thompson may be better than them lol
Draymond … yup…. Klay Thompson … yup…. He high af…. Yup… splash brothers …. Yup
4 of me and Klay Thompson. He's gonna have a game 6 night at some point
"Its not even necessarily about Westbrooks poor jump shooting, its about his serious lack of off ball game that has made things harder for his co-stars. Both the Rockets and Wizards actually had stronger offensive ratings with Russ on the bench and Harden/Beal on the floor. Also despite all of the praise he gets for taking the Wizards to the playoffs the truth is that they only won 9 more games compared to last year. And that was a season where the remains of IT started 37 games. Meanwhile Draymond Greens presence in Golden State significantly improves the overall efficiency of the offense and the numbers of Steph Curry. If Russ was legitimately active off of the ball in ways that didn't involve him jacking up low efficiency shots he would probably be a very impactful offensive player who's game could effectively work alongside ball dominant stars. For example, if Draymond Green sees that a team is sagging of him and baiting the jumper then he will automatically run a hand off or set a pindown for Steph Curry or Klay Thompson because he now knows that his defender will be woefully out of position. But That's because Draymond is a very willing off ball screener and understands his limitations as a player.   If you can provide significant evidence that Westbrook is capable of making those reads and actually willing to deploy those types of counters to teams sagging off of him then you'd have a much stronger argument for this working. If you say that he will do those things more often in LA as a result of Lebron and AD's influence then fine but as of right now we have never really seen him do that consistently so until we actually see evidence to the contrary we have no reason to reject the null hypothesis"
Klay Thompson. Kings are also known to give no name players career highs.
Than a unknown klay Thompson coming off an ACL and Achilles tear?? Fucking healthy Harris
"So, do you think Joe harris is a better shooter than Klay Thompson?"
Klay Thompson is food for thot.
"He got ""revenge"" because Klay Thompson and KD suffered an ACL and Achilles tear, lmao. Raptors fans need to cope hard"
Prime Klay Thompson
Not sure that I agree Klay is a lock.  Basketball-Reference HOF Probability puts the odds at Kevin Durant 100.00% Steph Curry 99.96% Klay Thompson 51.29%
"Wiggins, Klay Thompson"
"&gt; you're just saying shit just to be saying it. Kyrie and Klay have met head-to-head in 26 games, and Klay Thompson won 18 of those games.  Kyrie and Klay didnt play one on one games. Klay has always been on the better team, even the year the Cavs won."
"&gt;you're just saying shit just to be saying it. Kyrie and Klay have met head-to-head in 26 games, and Klay Thompson won 18 of those games.  In every playoff series that Kyrie and Klay have met in Kyrie has outplayed Klay Thompson. Yes, Klay's team has won 18/26, not Klay Thompson. Curry/KD played more of a factor in these wins."
"&gt; Kyrie has outplayed Klay in every series they've played.   you're just saying shit just to be saying it. Kyrie and Klay have met head-to-head in 26 games, and Klay Thompson won 18 of those games.  &gt; Kyrie is so much better offensively than Klay.  no contest there. i never said otherwise"
Kyrie doesn't belong in the same conversation as fucking Klay Thompson? LOL
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous. First is a set of people who have never made an all-star team, next is a list of players who weren't all-stars last year.  &amp;nbsp;  **Never Been All-Stars:**  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **F:** OG Anunoby  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Deandre Ayton  **Honourable mentions:** Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Clint Capela   &amp;nbsp;  **Best Non-2021 All-Stars**  **G:** Trae Young  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **F:** Khris Middleton  **F:** Jimmy Butler  **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns  **Honourable Mentions:** Demar DeRozan, Brandon Ingram, Klay Thompson, and everyone mentioned in the list above."
Dame went under the screen for Klay fucking Thompson.
Klay Thompson single handedly proves the hot hand.
"Should just ignore that comment. If a dude doesn't know that KAT is a 7ft1 Klay Thompson, you can't argue with him."
"https://courtsidescribbles.com/blog/legend-of-klay-thompson-toaster-signing  Also, I believe /u/rdollaz is the toaster guy"
Devin Booker scoring 70 vs the Celtics.   Klay thompson shooting 37 in a quarter   KD vs the Bucks (only needed an inch off his foot damn)
Klay Thompson every Game 6
Lebron and Klay Thompson. The ultimate 3 and D player and the point forward
"In a vacuum talentwise sure.  But needing to consider the heat from the locker room, the fans, media, and especially Klay Thompson &amp; Curry in the midst of a championship run changes things.  At least a little.  But maybe not apparently some people think."
"It’s much easier to not choke and to perform well when you’re surrounded by a core that won a championship and 73 games without you…obviously he’d play better with Steph freakin Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green surrounding him"
"Goofy comparing Love to Klay Thompson. Lebron got to the finals after losing Love in the first round.   Yes at his peak Love was a great defender, will never forget him chasing steph over the last seconds in the finals. He was an ok rebounder, and a good scorer. But his peak was short, and it was never that high of a peak lmfao.   On a real playoff team, he's not your first option, ideally he's your 3rd.  Cavs have won 19, 19, and 22 games in the last 3 years.   Was Minnesota making the playoffs regularly? Were they winning more than half their games?   Youre drunk. Steph went 39-33 last year. And you're a goddamn fool who watches power rankings as gospel."
KD played only 3 seasons with the Warriors and they won the finals without him and set the wins records without him. When people argue about Steph having help they mean Klay Thompson being there considering how Steph didn't have success until the Splash Bros got it going. We are talking about offensive scoring so I'm excluding Draymond for now.     Jordan is the GOAT but when it comes strictly to scoring. Steph is the best period.

"Klay Thompson is a gentleman and a scholar………………………………. He still randomly gives out gold for positive Klay comments, right?"
Danny Green is fine but Tristan Thompson against Kareem?  Maybe give Bron Kawhi or Klay as a 3 and D guy and then a HOF Center
I'm not sure why Tony gets the most shit for this. No one ever brings up Wade cheating on Gabrielle Union. Or Paul George cheating on Austin Rivers sister and offering to give his mistress a million dollars to get an abortion. Or Klay Thompson whose girlfriend walked in on him naked in the bed with someone else. Nope. Everyone just remembers Tony lol.
"This is a clickbait headline. He is berating Kenny because he was comparing Cousins to Klay Thompson, for which Shaq says they play different positions so you can't compare them.   Kenny comes up with A jordan comparison, at which Shaq says which big was Jordan better than? After this comes the headline OP has sneakily repurposed for baiting."
Steve Kerr Starting 5:  Steve Nash  Steph Curry  Klay Thompson  Draymond Green  Kevin Durant
"&gt;  Look I think Warriors are a contender, but you don't know any of this. At all. This is all speculation  We don't know that his Achilles surgery was a success?  Um, yes we do.  Obviously we don't know what level of performance he'll come back to, but he has a much better chance than basically anyone before KD as it is a completely different surgery than people like DeMarcus Cousins, Kobe, Dominique etc got for their injuries with a much better result in professional sports.  &gt;  I'm an MD and I've watched NBA at a serious level for 12 years, and Klay is far more unique than any other situation I've seen. Temper yourself. Every landing off a jumpshot, hold your breath. Do not act so confident, because what Klay has gone through is uncharted territory, nothing is set in stone. We really know nothing about his rehab either, other than it's done and completed.  Actually he's talked pretty extensively about his rehab, as did KD.  We've seen him moving around and running at full speed and doing exercises.  He looks pretty good, although obviously not game ready.  &gt;  Klay has dealt with atrophy in both legs, starting a year apart from each other, making his rehab that much more complicated. I mean what happened to him is nuts and just so unique.  No, he hasn't dealt with atrophy, wtf.  Do you think that he just sat in a bed with a cast for 3 years?  You say you're an MD, do you not know of ways to exercise legs without risking damage to an Achilles tendon or an ACL?  Because they 100% exist.  Also, the Warriors have posted multiple videos of him doing workouts, as has Klay himself, and it's pretty clear his legs aren't atrophied.  Fragile still, sure, but not atrophied.  &gt;  I am expecting a slow incline for most of the season, starting from 20 MPG; if there is one person in the league you have to baby until playoffs, it would be Klay Thompson.  I'm expecting him to not start out at the beginning of the season, then start really slowly off of the bench about 15 games in.  I expect he will be 90% of pre injury Klay by playoff time."
"&gt; Klay’s achilles surgery was as successful as KD’s and he’s been just as careful rehabbing. It will take some time to shake off rust but he’ll be back to form or close.  Look I think Warriors are a contender, but you don't know any of this. At all. This is all speculation  I'm an MD and I've watched NBA at a serious level for 12 years, and Klay is far more unique than any other situation I've seen. Temper yourself. Every landing off a jumpshot, hold your breath. Do not act so confident, because what Klay has gone through is uncharted territory, nothing is set in stone. We really know nothing about his rehab either, other than it's done and completed.   Could it have gone well? Sure. Does that mean hes ready to perform at game speed? Who knows. We all have to see for ourselves.  Klay has dealt with atrophy in both legs, starting a year apart from each other, making his rehab that much more complicated. I mean what happened to him is nuts and just so unique.  I am expecting a slow incline for most of the season, starting from 20 MPG; if there is one person in the league you have to baby until playoffs, it would be Klay Thompson."
"Both the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 Warriors had 6  Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Demarcus Cousins/David West"
Infinitely better shooter? Idk. Both guys are 40%+ shooters with insanely difficult shots off movement and screens. I got MPJ in that duncan robinson klay thompson tier of off ball shooter honestly
"Lmao   Cp3 was not in his prime that’s just BS   Capela was not elite and struggled to stay on the floor vs some teams   Gordon lmao   Veteran elite players who can’t shoot   Warriors had Klay Thompson who was better than any player on rockets. Amazing defender and obviously shooting   Draymond also better than any Rockets player. Dpoy   Barnes better than the 3rd best rockets player. Then you have iggy, Livingston, barnosa, etc… it’s not close. The warriors 6man won finals mvp lmao   I’m not even hating on curry. Harden has just done way more with less and curry with his one real chance, this season, didn’t replicate what harden could do."

"Really? Because that Lacob interview where he's crying about the luxury tax seems to say otherwise. I wonder if an owner who thinks the roster isn't championship or bust this year would say , “If we can’t [win a title], then you should look at Joe Lacob and Bob Myers and Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins and say you weren’t good enough,” Lacob said. “You’re paying all that money you weren’t good enough."""
[brons Halloween party ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.www.complex.com/sports/2018/12/klay-thompson-calls-cavs-bums-over-halloween-cookie-troll) which included a reference to the warriors blown 3-1 lead as well as cookies with Steph and Klays tombstones. That shit is petty asf lol

"Jesus Christ.  Klay thompson and Draymond green would be the 2nd and 3rd best players on our team, even when you account for dwight. Iggy would be 5th. The warriors cast is *far* better then ours. I’m not entertaining this argument anymore when you just won’t admit when you’re wrong"

"&gt; you could've swapped half a dozen players for him in 2016  Probably true, but that doesn't mean Kyrie was *overrated*. I don't think most people considered Ky the #1 on that team, and when there are only 6 players that can replace you as a #2, you're doing pretty well for yourself.  I can name 6 guys that you can replace Klay Thompson with and the Warriors would still win all those Championships as well. Doesn't mean he's not one heck of a player."
Klay Thompson vs the Kings in January 2015  It lasted one quarter
I used to say I'd take J.R. Smith over Klay Thompson.
"2012 Derrick Rose. Great that he made it back, but there was still growth to be had from that point.  Klay Thompson. 2019 &amp; 2020. He handled the knee like a G, but this had to be the most pointless Achilles tear ever."
"&gt; That’s like saying Klay Thompson is better than Lebron because he’s a better shooter.   No, that'd be like saying Klay is better than LeBron because he's a better shooter AND equal at everything else."
"Klay Thompson is the best 2 guard in the NBA.  Mainly because he plays defense better than any 2 guards who can outscore him, as the gap between other 2 guards offense and Klays offense is not nearly as big as the gap between Klays defense and those same 2 guards' defense."
Klay Thompson year 2 playoffs: 16/3.5/3.5 on 53%TS 37MPG  MPJr year 2 playoffs: 17.4/6/1 on 60%TS 33MPG  Give MPJr more reps in the playoffs and he'll be just as good or even better than Prime Klay
You were saying he’s basically Klay Thompson on offense. The same dude who dropped 41 against the Thunder in game 6? Plus I never said he was a scrub
Basically Klay Thompson already? Didn’t see none of that during the Suns series
"Defensively, idk.  But offensively? He’s basically Klay Thompson already. 19PPG on 66%TS, with almost all of his shots come from spot-ups and cuts. I could see him getting to 25-28PPG easily, he’s so good.  Last 20 games of last season he was at 24PPG on 67%TS  Klay has never even surpassed 60%TS"
Klay Thompson for one quarter against the Kings in January 2015
Depends on what you mean.   Klay Thompson was the best player of all time for about 9:40 of a single quarter.
"This is fair  I hear Kevin Durant comps, I see a guy who's, like, somewhere between ""rich man's Ryan Anderson"" and ""poor man's Klay Thompson"".  Useful player, sure, but I just don't see him getting near that KD level."
"That’s like saying Klay Thompson is better than Lebron because he’s a better shooter. They both play completely different roles in their respective teams and they both do a hell of a job, but ones a second option to a top 20 player, and the other IS a proven top 20 player (in Jimmy’s case, more like 25 if you really hate the dude). Different roles show you different perspectives and 9 times out of 10, the 1st option is going to be better than the 2nd, especially when the 2nd has proven that he can’t be that guy."
Never let a series go to 6 games if you’re playing against Klay Thompson.
Klay Thompson
"Unless you are an NBA fan in general, most people wouldn't recognize Klay Thompson on the street.  I think about my co-workers and in a diverse, multicultural office of 40 people.  At most, I would guess only 2 of them would know what Klay Thompson looks like."
This reminds me of the Klay Thompson interview on scaffolding
Believe it or not the average person probably doesn’t know what Klay Thompson looks like especially if they don’t give a damn about sports which is a lot more people than you’d expect.
"true but klay thompson is also more famous than jordan clarkson, esp for casuals"
"i mean this type of thing has happened in a lot of places, a NY tv reporter asked klay thompson about scaffolding in NYC   this mall is 2 blocks away from the arena i give you a 1000% guarantee people in the area recognized JC, just not this reporter"
"I don't disagree but Klay Thompson solves this problem for the Warriors. Yes. Simmons can play the Draymond role but you still need a Klay Thompson. We didn't even make the playoffs last year and the Blazers did. So they will still have problems to solve. You can say a SG is easy to find but really, who?"
"I don’t expect him to play 20min. More like 10min. Bjelinka will help a lot with spacing. Porter if healthy is a steal and Wiseman was getting a lot better towards the end of the season before the injury. Also you haven’t acknowledged my point of Klay Thompson. Even if he’s 50% of himself pre injury, that’s a hell of a lot better than what we had last year. Also Jordan Poole was playing incredible last year and he’s added muscle over the offseason. Idk dude, warriors are trending up heavily and I think they’ll definitely be 4-6 seed. We’ll see though, it does seem like your mind is made up."
"Klay Thompson, I love watching him shoot, possibly the quickest release in the league and he can heat up more than almost anyone else. Plus he's a funny dude off the court. His IG Lives from his boat are hilarious sometimes lol"
"A couple of fun facts:  - Since catch-and-shoot stats were first tracked in 2013-14, only 4 times has a player recorded 10 catch &amp; shoot PPG in a season. Klay alone has done it 3 times.   - In his last 4 healthy seasons, Klay Thompson led the league in catch-and-shoot PPG in all but 2018-19, when he was 2nd in the league only behind Steph Curry by 0.1 PPG.   - Klay has 5 of the 10 highest catch-and-shoot scoring seasons since catch-and-shoot stats were first tracked. Compared to that, every other player in the top 10 in that category has just one season in which they were top 10 in that regard."
Wait did you just call Klay Thompson one of the two greatest perimeter scorers in history??
"Because somehow Moody Kuminga and Poole are more valuable. I get it. We tried to trade Klay before for KLove and we declined. It worked. Problem is Zion right now is miles better than prime KLove and will fit perfectly to the Warriors offense (which we desperately need right now). Pair Curry, Thompson, Green with a fkin Shaqmobile like Zion or Giannis, that’s a dark horse at worse"
"Drives me nuts sometimes because off-ball play is what's truly additive for the team.  If you have 5 great ball-dominant players who can iso, that's worth so much less than 5 great off-ball players who *don't* just iso, but play as a team.  People undervalue what Klay Thompson's always brought for that reason. You could plug Klay Thompson into any team in the league and that team gets better."
"I guess chucking and missing 3s aren't apart of basketball?  Yea dude a guy doesn't need to be hitting free throws to torch a team. And you don't torch a team by hitting free throws either LOL.  Klay Thompson never gets free throws, but he could be shooting over 50% from the field, over 40% from 3, but if his TS% isn't 60% he's not torching teams?   Lol Harden's last 2 playoffs xD. Yea his last one hes joined a super team where he doesn't have to see a double team ever again, and when he came back from injury he was a shell of his former shelf he couldn't even attempt shots, of course his efficiency will look good, he ain't even taking shots.  The playoffs before he was playing like dick cheese against the Thunder and even though he shot better against the Lakers, the Rockets got trashed on in 5.   Harden isn't being penalized for facing weaker teams, he quite simply, hasn't beaten a team that's as good as or better than the Clippers. He had his chance in 2017 against the Spurs and he choked that loss horribly."
"In what world are old ass Igoudola, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green better perimeter defenders than Paul George, Kawhi, and Pat Bev?  Luka literally made Pat Bev unplayable and Zubac could never see a minute on the court because of Luka.  Luka is a more efficient finisher at the basket, better mid range shooter, better post scorer, and his deep range shooting is as efficient as Harden's."
"When Steph ""playoff underperformer"" Curry, Kevin ""can't carry a team"" Durant, Draymond ""triple single"" Green and Klay ""role player"" Thompson go 16-1 in the playoffs but are apparently all trash"
"He’s just another role player. He’s not bad. But teams tend to over react to their bench talent.   Talen Horton-Tucker really is just a regular bench guy, same way Alex Caruso is, same way that Poole is. They’re not bad players and they’re not busts or anything. But they’re literally 12-15 minute a game guys and nothing more.   It’s okay to like role players but we don’t have to hype them up as way more than they really are.   Food for thought: Poole played last year. He’s probably not better than Klay Thompson and Moses Moody so I don’t know how many minutes he even gets this year on a WINNING warriors team.  Any role player can score 12 a night on a losing team"
I don’t believe any list that tells you JJ Reddick is a better shooter than Klay Thompson

You took out Pistol Pete for Chris Bosh and Klay Thompson?
Klay Thompson really took this and perfected it.   He became a master of catch-and-shooting independently of how his body is orientated. Look at his game against the Bulls where he set the record of 3PA in a game.
"Kobe 81 points, Klay Thompson 37 in one quarter, Curry OKC game winner, Jordan Cleveland game winner  These ones stick out immediately, iconic games overall."
Klay Thompson
37 point quarter for Klay Thompson. Single most amazing basketball feat I have ever seen.
*Klay Thompson likes this.*
Most people use that pause or shoot two motion for the midrange. Shooting the same shot he does for the 3 point line is too strong.   You can see the same thing with klay Thompson and Kyrie in that they have a higher set point/noticeable pause in the midrange compared to their three ball.
Also Klay Thompson apparently goes from not ranked to 57th place despite not touching the floor between last year and this year lol.
"Probably Chris Paul. I’m not sure he would win but I think he is the best combination of defense, offense, and tenacity at guard.   Love to see what Jordan-Oscar Robinson would look like.  Would love to see what Jordan would do with Dame who shoots the most best deep balls, but lacking in D.   Also a full prime Klay Thompson would be interesting to see what the era differences are between the best two way 2 guards. Same with a prime Brandon Roy."
The best supporting cast to surround bron with are spot up shooters. He’ll have an all-time great spot up shooter in his prime Klay Thompson by his side. Thats scary. But the Kd Curry pick-n-roll was so devastating when it was used that it should easily match or even outplay a Lebron-Klay combo. I think it will really come down to Draymond vs Love. Whoever’s supportng cast plays better and more efficiently will probably be the big factor in deciding who wins.
I would take Klay Thompson over Scottie Pippen
"no , im asking him to clarify that he genuinely does not believe klay Thompson is an all time great , bc he most definitely is , unless your standards for an all time great are significantly higher than most people . Klay is a top 5 historical nba shooter , one of the deadliest on fire players ever seen , and was an absolutely key part of one of the greatest championship teams ever seen"
"Probably not because they'd still be slow and not skilled at perimeter defense. Think of two big men trying to guard Steph Curry and Klay Thompson screening for each other. Seasoned perimeter defenders are better at navigating screens and keeping up with players running around off the ball.  Big men are not only slower, but also less experienced with playing perimeter defense at a high level, particularly off-ball. People often talk about defense being about effort/physical tools, but a lot of it is mental/skill based too. Like do you go over or under that screen? Is he really cutting that way, or is it just a fake to run the other way? It takes time/experience guarding certain actions to learn how you can defend them and gain the muscle memory do make those decisions really quickly. Big men largely wouldn't have that and would get torn up defensively trying to guard perimeter players who know how to move without the ball."
No this list is garbage af. Klay thompson is listed as “scrub”
"that seems like a dig at klay more than a real opinion , how do you define all time great if not klay Thompson ?"
Why not just Klay Thompson then?
"I mean if we're just talking about a style of play that best compliments his style of play, Klay Thompson"
Pre injury Klay Thompson O_o
Well you could add Butler or a 90% Klay Thompson and still fit the rules of this post and that'd be it
One that hasn't been mentioned yet - In 2014 a bunch of reports about a potential Klay Thompson for Kevin Love trade came out. Would most likely prevent the Warriors era + change the look of Lebron's second stint with the Cavs.
"In 2011, the Warriors tried trading Curry and Klay to New Orleans for Chris Paul. Dell Demps was up for it, but CP3 refused to commit to GS long-term and killed the deal.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-tried-to-trade-stephen-curry-klay-thompson-to-hornets-for-chris-paul-in-2011-report-says/"
"But construct a roster of players that are AD and players worse than AD. You could have a roster of all stars, they easily win. Ad, cp3, Klay thompson, playoff pee, and Rudy gobert fit this criteria. That team is winning a ship"
Klay Thompson.
Klay Thompson?
&gt; Kevin Durant - Borderline All-Star  &gt; Kyrie Irving - Borderline All-Star  &gt; Klay Thompson - Scrub  Algorithms are sometimes bad.
"&gt; Klay Thompson one of the best 3 point shooters of all time. “Scrub”  They factor injuries and recovery from injuries into the mix. They're not saying Klay Thomspon has been a scrub, but that he possible could be after suffering 2 of the most devastating injuries you can endure."
"Klay Thompson. Perfect shooting form, great offball movement, and elite defender. Prime Klay was a perfect player for any NBA team"
"Klay Thompson one of the best 3 point shooters of all time. “Scrub”  KD, reaching T10 most points scored all time. Multiple time all star. “Borderline all star”  These people need help"
"Yeah. Note the players that Kevin Durant are matched with. It's all players that was good, had an off/injury season, came back to more or less where they were and then dropped off. It's also worth noting that Kevin Durant is already 33. Even without injuries, you'd expect him to start dropping off now.  Also, Klay Thompson haven't played a minute of basketball in 2 seasons. Why would you assume that he's back to anywhere close to where he was?"
"Bud. KD averaged 27 a game on his highest eFG% ever in his career, including 45% from 3. That’s one year removed from injury. He’s not a borderline all-star. He’s a borderline MVP.  And Klay Thompson as a scrub is just laughable."
"&gt;More like ""their system accurately deals with missed seasons, but /r/nba has just decided that Klay Thompson and KD are both immune to aging and will never feel the effects of any of their injuries""  Missing the 2020 season would make sense as a reason to project Durant to play fewer minutes (significant downside risk of another major injury).   But it doesn't make sense as a reason to project him to play 45% more minutes than last year with far worse per/possession production.  &gt;If you want to see an actual bug in their system it's the Jimmer Fredette bug of accidently classifying old overseas players as young rookies.  This is actually part of the same problem: their system only looks at the past three seasons."
"More like ""their system accurately deals with missed seasons, but /r/nba has just decided that Klay Thompson and KD are both immune to aging and will never feel the effects of any of their injuries""  If you want to see an actual bug in their system it's the Jimmer Fredette bug of accidently classifying old overseas players as young rookies."
"yes. Trae Young === Steph Curry, Bogdonavic === Klay Thompson, and John Collins === Draymond Green. The Hawks have obviously figured out the NBA and will go 74-8 and leave LeOld James in the dust before signing Luka in 2025"
"Steph Curry, Giannis, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Clint Capela, OG Anunoby, DeAaron Fox, DeAndre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Jamal Murray, John Collins      1) Dray brings up the ball, scans for best play   2) Spams Steph + Giannis PnR, because that is literally the best hypothetical play in the NBA   3) Giannis dunk, or Steph 3   4) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), kick out to Klay/OG/MPJ/Murray for either an open 3 or a cut to the basket, as Steph, Giannis and especially Draymond are all capable passers.   5) If that somehow doesn't work (it will), Clint Capela or DeAndre Ayton gets the offensive rebound and dunks it.   6) If half-court sets are broken up by the other team, Fox and Collins go fast, score in transition like brrrrrrrrrrr"
"Although one thing is that advanced metrics for whatever reason have always absolutely hated Klay Thompson(I think because he doesn't rebound or assist at all)  This isn't necessarily a reflection of his injury, I'm pretty sure these projections kind of underrated him to begin with"
"&gt;Klay Thompson - Scrub  Finally, someone had to say it!"
Superstar = potential #1 option on champ squad.  Superstars: Giannis &amp; Steph   All stars: Donovan Mitchell &amp; Jason Tatum   Roleplayers:  * Trae Young * Jrue Holiday * Khris Middelton * DeAndre Ayton * Karl-Anthony Towns * Julius Randle * Klay Thompson  * Booker
"KD, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Javalle McGee  Andre Iguodala, Seth Curry, Harrison Barnes, Tobias Harris, Thybulle"
"people are acting like the return of klay Thompson means it's the 2015-2016 run back  The core three are 6 years older now,  and is an entirely different roster this time.  Klay comes back after the 2 worst injuries an athlete can have, I don't see how anyone thinks this team are contenders, even if klay is good"
Question is. How does it stack up to the infamous Klay Thompson/Rocco pasta?
Curry Luka Klay Thompson/Paul George og anunoby and gobert starting 5. Back ups I’ll take Dwight Josh Richardson Jordan Clarkon Marcus Morris annnnd Dort
"giannis and curry as superstars, davis may be a better fit (arguably?) but is less rekiable health wise   giannis can be a super draymond in offense as a pick and roll partner who can playmake when curry goes off ball, and curry spacing would be lethal   best inside and outside scorers in the league right now  for all stars i need shooting and wing defense  mostly   so give me paul george (if he doesnt count as superstar) who also gives me an extra ball handler which you never can have too much of   i would put klay Thompson but because of injuries i would go with middleto n. strong shooter and defender plus chemistry with giannis   and finally myles Turner, for defense mostly plus some  so-so spacing at the 5 like brook lopez does    myles Turner  giannis  middleton  George  curry   that team is fairly formidable with 4 great scorers, 3 great shooters(GOAT shooter included) plus a decent fourth shooter, and the best interior scorer   and the defense would be dominant"
"I’m going to try to also just include mainly role players.    C: Myles Turner  PF: Giannis  SF: KD  SG: Klay Thompson  PG: Jrue Holiday   Bench:  Reggie Jackson  Seth Curry  Matisse Thybulle  Robert Covington  Joe Ingles  Bobby Portis  Brook Lopez     Definitely could be better when some of the non All Star picks but without picking fringe All Stars, I like this team. Jrue was the toughest pick as I wasn’t sure if CP3, Trae, Booker among others were Superstars so I decided between Jrue and Lowry. Jrue I think fits better with a team like this personally."
"Tell that to Klay Thompson, who was forced by Mark Jackson to post up on the block several times a game for no discernible reason.  Look at that and look at how Kerr used him.  It’s a player’s league for sure, but coaching still matters."
"Not sure about 82-0, but I think this could be close:  KD, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and some role players like Andre Iguodala but younger"
"PG: Stephen Curry (All-Star)  SG: Klay Thompson (All-Star)  SF: Kawhi Leonard (Superstar)  PF: Kevin Durant (Superstar)  C: Draymond Green (Hasn’t been an All-Star in 3 years, probably never will be again)   So basically the Warriors plus Kawhi lol"
"That’s not what I’m saying at all. Thompson is amazing moving off ball. But he’s not better than Curry at it. No one is. The only thing he’s maaaaybe better at (and it’s debatable) is pure spot up shooting, which is why I said that’s the only area where it might be arguable. But Steph is the GOAT off ball and it’s not close - not with Klay or any other player ever. If you don’t see that we’re not going to get anywhere, so have a good one."
no I'm talking about danny green unnecessarily comtesting Klay Thompson resulting in an acl tear. Klay was lava hot when he got hurt and no doubt in my mind theres a game 7 with Klay.
"You gotta split LeBron’s career in 2 main pieces:   •Spurs (Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard) Tim Duncan caused the most damage offensively, so I would consider Tim Duncan to be his greatest rival from 07-14.  •Warriors (Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala) Stephen Curry has played longer than KD on the warriors and has had a leader role for almost his  whole career, thats why I believe Stephen Curry is LeBron’s greatest rival from 2015 to now."
"And they still kind of messed up drafting after he left and they sucked again. The only good pick they did was Kyrie and that was the easiest #1 pick in that era besides AD. In 2011 if they draft Kyrie &amp; Klay that’s amazing back court that would provide some of the most spacing ever and with Klay being the greatest off ball shooter he wouldn’t get in the way of Kyrie &amp; then eventually LeBron as well. In 2012 instead of drafting Dion Waiters, they should’ve drafted Harrison Barnes to have him play at the wing alongside Klay Thompson to make a very good defensive wing unit and keep LeBron at the 4 so the Cavs stay elite defensively and never have the drop off on the defensive end that they had in the 16-17 season. And with knowing how weak the 2013 NBA Draft is now, I think the Cavs should’ve traded the #1 pick to move down and get assets for future drafts. So in this scenario the Cavs draft CJ McCollum and have him be their 6th man off the bench with anywhere between the 5-10 pick if they traded down and instead of drafting Sergey with the 19th pick in the 2013 draft, they drafted Tony Snell who becomes another defensive wing off the bench that can shoot. Then the last move I would’ve made was trade some of those assets I got for trading the #1 pick to get Al Horford and have him play center so the team would’ve been ahead of the versatility bigs who can switch on the perimeter while stretching the floor. If the Cavs would’ve built their team like this, they could’ve been a 70 win+ team I truly believe and would’ve made those Heat teams look like amateurs."
I don't think anyone has said MPJ is currently as good of a player as peak Klay Thompson?
"Putting up a significantly more efficient shooting season at age 22 than Klay Thompson has ever had absolutely makes you a better shooting prospect, what?  Obviously, we have to see if he can sustain it, but the course that he's on projects to be substantially better than Klay's.   Saying someone's on track to do something doesn't mean it's a forgone conclusion."
Klay Thompson sucks man. He hasn’t scored 10 points in like 3 seasons
"Allen Iverson? He played 12 years of elite ball, dude was 33 when he went to Detroit and got hurt. Newton is 32 and hasn't been the same the last 3 years maybe even 4. Newton had such a short time of peak top tier football too. You gotta go with someone like John wall or arenas, Brandon Roy. Klay Thompson would be another one. Iverson though had a solid career and for the amount of punishment he took and injuries he played through, 12 years is plenty long of elite level play."
"MPJ is today, right now, the best catch and shoot wing shooter in the league. He’s already a better shooter than Klay Thompson.  I mean the stats are right there. No one can touch him as a pure shooter except for steph and KD."
"I'll start with one that seems weird given history but I believe to be true: Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson  With Curry off the court Klay often started having tunnel vision at times and they just didn't mesh well as two ""score first"" players  Statically KD/Draymond lineups were actually only like 2 points worse than with Curry on the court, but KD/Klay/Draymond lineups were actually worse than lineups with only KD and no one else"
Klay Thompson
"“Klay Thompson is also likely headed to the Hall of Fame as one of the best two-way players in the game, and he may go down as the second-best shooter behind Curry by the time both their careers end. And as a key to three title teams, Draymond Green will have a good case, too.”  -- Nick Friedell  It’s not difficult to make it into the hall of fame, nobody thinks the stats you posted are wrong you just don’t know what you’re talking about."
I swear Warriors fans are treating Klays return like he’s prime Klay times 2. These guys didn’t even make the playoffs last year and some people think half a season of MAYBE “healthy” (as healthy as you can be after two straight serious injuries back to back) Klay Thompson will make them contenders
Bigger Klay Thompson or Peja.
Wow Klay Thompson has not made 1st or 2nd team?
The strength on this guy.  Klay Thompson isn’t a small dude 👀
op is actually klay thompson
Giannis Antetokoumpo  Steve Adams Klay Thompson
KLAY THOMPSON AT WORST IS TOP 5 3 SHOOTER OF ALL TIME. WHATTAA THA FUCK ARE YOU ON ABOUT?
Sportsbooks are scratching their heads wondering why Klay Thompson MVP bets have skyrocketed in the last 12 hours.
klay thompson is the second coming of the John Wall contract. Draymond is putting up triple singles. anyone who thinks golden state is finishing in the top 4 of the west is either smoking rocks or is 12 years old
"Everybody is hating one these terms but I feel like when used properly you are essentially describing the whole point of the spear or the guy throwing it analogy. I feel like most of the it’s a poor way of describing how well someone can play with others combined with volume vs efficiency. There are exceptions to every rule but it’s almost accurate.  Take kris Middleton, klay Thompson, devin Booker, all of these guys are people I consider ceiling raisers. Guys that can’t carry your offense for an entire season but can make it elite. These guys are all pretty efficient   Compare that to Rudy gobert, Westbrook, , all guys that can carry a team but you have to scheme around some facet of their game so they need some specific pieces to be effective  Some guys can do both, Lebron, Kawhi,"
Klay Thompson is not at all a good off ball defender...
"A lot of people in this thread who don’t understand what hypothetically means.   You could prolly get about any good-excellent center but I don’t know if you could get a guard like D’aaron Fox. Not because they aren’t of comparable “goodness” rather they fill vastly different. Maybe this is a “no duh” but when comparing Gobert to wing players of similar caliber (e.g. Tatum, Butler, PG, Beal, etc.) you can kind of see what I’m getting at. Those guys are so versatile they can fill a need on any contender whereas Gobert needs to be built around. Even if you view Gobert as much worse than I do you’ll still get my point, just think of more versatile players of similar value. I think the best fit for Gobert right now is Golden State but I’m not sure if it’s worth giving up Klay Thompson or their young core."
"I know it’s easy to shit on the org, and they definitely made mistakes, but it’s also really hard to build around a #1 pick that’s an all-NBA player right out of the gate. The Mavs have the same issue with Luka. You only get these kind of guys when you’re a deep lottery team, then they come in and instantly boost your team out of the lottery. Then suddenly your picks aren’t as valuable in trades and if you keep them it’s hard to find impact players in the 20s.   If you’re not in a FA destination city, what are you supposed to do to build a contender? All-star caliber 2nd options like Khris Middleton or Klay Thompson or Kyle Lowry aren’t easily available.  The Mavs have a lot of good role players around Luka, and the Cavs did a decent job of getting role players around LeBron too. The problem is finding a true 2nd option"
"Klay Thompson is a max contact guy, who would've been offered a max contract by every team in the league with available cap space had he got free agency. He's a modern day Ray Allen, don't downplay how effective he can be."
"Giannis, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton and Paul George/Bradley Beal/Donovan Mitchell/Klay Thompson would be favorites there dude. They would have better shooting and defense pretty handily, and could play great zone with Giannis and Brook Lopez to force shots from the nets"
"Klay Thompson   Really wonder what his game would be like if he were the #1 or 2 player for a team like... Sacramento, Orlando, or Minnesota"
Mychal and Klay Thompson
"""It’s great on both side, both ah… it’s great both, both of them are great. And we getting out pushing the pace, that’s what our best.""  \- [Klay Thompson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-Payfj2P4E)"
"""I can park it anywhere just like I can pull up and shoot from anywhere"". - Klay Thompson"
whatever klay thompson said when they were up 3-1 to the the cavs lol
"What I’m saying is Klay is a player with many weaknesses in his game that he’s had the luxury of having masked by the all-time talent around him thats why I’m talking about their capabilities as a #1 bc that’s as close to a vacuum as we can get….Klay Thompson needs a Steph Curry to create for him and make up for him nights where his shot isn’t falling since he can’t get to the rim or line at a high level, he needs a Draymond/Iggy to get the ball to him and make up for his poor team defense that drags down his defensive value….also Zach Lavine can’t lead a team to a title in his current form but he’s better than Klay ever was, but I wouldn’t be surprised if many would rather have Klay as a #2…if you need a superstar and DPOTY ahead of you to be more valuable then you’re not the better player, you’re just in a better situation for your skillset."
"LMAO no he wasn't.   His best season was 2016, where he was All NBA 3rd team. Lowry in '16 was not better than: LeBron, Steph, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeMarcus Cousins or Anthony Davis, that's 10 right there and then you have guys like Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge are all IMO better and then guys like Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Millsap, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony Towns, Gordon Hayward were debatedly better.   Lowry at his peak was a top 20 player for sure, but top 10 is a huge stretch. ESPN had him at #18 following his 2016 All NBA season, Sport's Illustrated had him at #34, Washington Post at #14, Fadeaway World had him outside their top 20, CBS at #17. Lowry was never a consensus top 10 guy."
Pre-injury Klay Thompson.
Good thing Cam Redish played with them at Duke and was drafted the same year. He can fill in as a budget Klay Thompson
Because they can score and are usually more skilled to compensate for height. I'd be more scared of a wide open 6'1 shooter than a 6'7 forward on the perimeter (unless the due is Klay Thompson)  I played four years of college basketball as a starter and if I was a recruiter trying to fill out a team; you gotta add the undersized quick pg with handles that can beat people off of dribbles and hopefully uses common sense to not go head first into a 6'8+ big
"Curry fans are hands down the worst.   Followed by Klay Thompson fans.   Fantastic players, some of the best all time. Just some lovesick ass backwards jock riding stans repping their jerseys."
Idk why everyone doesn't go find a prime Klay Thompson
lmao mychal thompson so high he's responding to a fake klay account lmaooooooo
Warriors right now: A team to look out for. Warriors with full strength Klay Thompson this year: Heaven help us.....
"as much as i hate to say it, Klay Thompson deserves to be in that discussion. hasn't played at all since getting his max contract and there no way he returns as a 40m type player."
"Klay Thompson.  He's the 10th highest paid player in the league, and has missed the last two seasons due to Injury.  I hope he can return to form, but after two consecutive season ending injuries. There is no guarantees."

"Gary reminds me a lot of a young Norm tbh. He can be a really high level role player when he's on, but he's extremely inconsistent. This season alone he's had 3 games shooting below 30% and then 2 games where he was basically Klay Thompson."

my brother once said around 2016-17 that Klay Thompson was better than prime Dwyane Wade.
Klay Thompson trying to be cute and saying funny things is not funny at all and extremely annoying.
"There was a very popular thread 1-2 days back about how Draymond is a better player than Klay Thompson, which is an outrageous take"
Klay Thompson is my least favorite player in the league.
It’s probably both. Imagine the type of absolute pressure Klay Thompson smokes on
The Warriors should've traded Klay Thompson for Kevin Love. I'm very thankful they didn't!
"Just give LeBron the Klay Thompson role, running around for 3s. Hell it doesn't have to be the whole half court running, just run at the left side or something cause he's a better shooter at that side of the court"
"Klay Thompson during a visit to his middle school in Portland: “Man! Kids are so young!"""
"They need the other guy though. The Walhberg to Ferrell. The Crowe to the Gosling. My move it Klay Thompson, Cody Bellinger and Madison Bumgardner"
Klay Thompson was not snubbed from the top 75 list. I’ve seen way too many people claim he deserves to be there but he doesn’t. Dwight was the only one I believe has a legitimate case to claim he was snubbed.
"yeah but he's so good that's almost a disservice!  lavine is in that weird niche of players where, if he's your #1 everything on offense, you're fucked. but if you already have a great #1 ball-handler, playmaker, scorer, and you add lavine, you're a legit title contender. he's closer to klay thompson than kevin durant, in that regard."
Klay Thompson isn't funny.
Klay Thompson is a national treasure.
"Klay Thompson - “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.”"
"i say this elsewhere in the thread, but people don't realize lavine was only second to steph in terms of efficiency for high-usage scoring guards in the league last year.  lavine scored 27.5 ppg last year on eFG% an true shooting percentages that are literally only topped by steph curry among high-usage guards.  last year, curry scored 32 ppg (#1 in the league) on 60.5 eFG%. Lavine scored 27.5 ppg (#7) on 59.6 eFG%.  no other high usage guard in the league comes close to this. hes more efficient than kyrie, lillard, beal, booker, mitchell, murray... whatever down the line. he reminds me most of klay thompson on offense actually, but if klay was slightly worse shooter but also one of the best in-game slashers/dunkers in the league. 27.5 pph on 50/41/85 shooting splits is just absolutely insane"
That klay Thompson is a better basketball player than steph curry
Jordan Poole keeps the starting job after Klay Thompson returns.

"Sons of NBA stars rarely almost never become stars themselves. Idk why.  Klay Thompson is the closest example I can think of- his dad was really good, a #1 overall draft pick and averaged 18/9 in his prime but never an all star.   Thinking about NBA legends kids who have made the league or even come close- Patrick Ewing Jr was a nobody who had a 10-day once, Gary Payton II keeps going in and out, Wade's kid is a D-League guy now, Luke Walton had a decade long career as a scrub, John Stockton's kid maybe had some 10-days, and that's really all I can think of."
The only NBA father-son tandem that I feel were remotely on the same level was Mychal &amp; Klay Thompson. Usually it's like a Patrick Ewing Jr. thing where it's not even close. Dell Curry was a good starter and great shooter but obviously Steph is waaaaaay better.
"It's not their fault the season ended in a bubble. If that's what makes it the weakest ring then too bad. A ring though is a ring. So you can all water it down all you want but I know a lot of other franchises that woulda taken that bubble championship in a heart beat. Ffs even a curry, kd, draymond, klay thompson team could only win 2 championships. But y'all just run your mouth like its so easy.   Btw the lakers will never be irrelevant. They would have been years ago if that's the case. And all those home grown talents we tried our hands on from d'lo to lonzo, ya they got us so far. Y'all were still the same mfs shitting on them and begging for them to traded for a superstar. You guys just make me laugh tbh."
The opposite of LeBron to me would be Peja or something. In the modern game Klay Thompson (he can play SF I guess)
"Maybe. I'm not sure they should be on the list either.  There's better Golden State Warriors than Klay Thompson...Chris Mullin, Draymond Green and maybe Tim Hardaway too."
"man u r just fuckin sad. players like klay thompson, andre iguadola, josh hart, and many other wing players had to play defense with their hands tied behind their ass and they STILL got fouls called on them because of harden's bullshit. he's a disgrace to the game and i can't wait to watch him get exposed"
"This got me thinking, what if we combined Draymond Green and Klay Thompson? Greatest player of all time?"
"Klay ""77"" Thompson!"
 1. Kobe 2. DeWayne Wade 3. Reggie Miller 4. MJ 5. Ray Allen 6. Kris Middleton 7. Klay Thompson 8. DeMar Derozan 9.  Victor Oladipo 10. Jerry West
They struggled to beat the Grizzlies with Melo shooting like Klay Thompson. This Lakers team doesn’t look promising if you look at them with any objectivity. Westbrook was playmaking well early on but cancelled a lot of it out with turnovers. They can’t defend that well. Lebrun is settling for more jumpers and looks less explosive driving. AD looks elite but his health is always a concern. I don’t think they’re the runaway favorites the oddsmakers and 2K thinks they are. I wouldn’t be surprised if they don’t make it out of the West again. They look like a bunch of misfits thrown together. Great  individual talent on paper but a bad fit.
"Move Klay to the three then and take out Wiggins. At this point klay will have lost a lot of mobility and his best bet will be moving to the 3 much like Khris Middleton after his hamstring injury.   I don’t exactly know what the future for 20 year old James wiseman holds. I think he has the physical tools and the potential to become an all star one day. The thing is if he ever does reach that potential or start to reach that potential it will most likely be in a few years. A few years where curry will be fast approaching 40 and green and Thompson will be in their mid 30s. I.e when the warriors window is pretty much shut.   Instead of wiseman, who’s absolutely a net negative right now you could have Lamelo who’s not only bursting at the seams with potential, but who is also producing at or close to an all star caliber level."
"On the topic of awards, Klay Thompson is a fantastic basketball player"
"What kind of record?  It's not a record for a first quarter, because Steph had 25 the other day. There's probably others but it's easiest to point out the one that just happened that I watched happen.  It's also not the record for points in a quarter (that's 37, Klay Thompson) or points in a quarter without a miss (also 37, Klay Thompson)."
Hot take: Klay Thompson.  The Warriors have seen him in practice and know he is a diminished version of his former self. The will sell while his value is high before he plays in another game.
"I hear you, only 2 jersey I have are a D wade And Klay Thompson. I love my guy and I really think he deserves it. People forget he was a top 2 SG for almost all of the warriors run, elite defender who could pop off for 60 on 10 dribbles."
See: Klay Thompson
Gonna need a wellness check on Klay Thompson.
Anyone who thinks Klay Thompson is one of the 75th best players in NBA history is an absolute moron.
"Klay Thompson is out of his mind. Career averages of 19.5 ppg, 3.5 rpg and 2.3 apg don't make you the 75th best player in league history, and neither does playing with two actual all time greats."
“Gary Harris is going to be a better version of Klay Thompson” ooof that aged horribly
Say u don’t watch klay without saying u don’t watch klay. Count how many off dribble or just downright difficult shots he hits ur self then make sure to tell urself “I didn’t know wtf I was saying” after. [klay thompson creating ](https://youtu.be/bBIvtFZDQ28)
Yea bc Evan Fournier and klay Thompson are comparable...asinine comparison bozo try again. Klay has Fournier’s skillset x10 mentioning Fournier is just missing the point by choice.
if Dwight Howard and T Mac can’t make the list…Klay Thompson shouldn’t be anywhere near it
"holy shit, klay thompson, 6'6"" shooting guard for the golden state warriors, has a boat? how come we haven't heard more about this?"
"Klay Thompson vs Kemba Walker 2018-2019 Regular season  Klay - 21.5 ppg / 3.8 rebounds / 2.4 assists on 57.1% true shooting, 25.6% usage. 78 games played.  Kemba - 25.6 ppg / 4.4 rebounds / 5.9 assists on 55.8% ts, **31.5% usage**. **82 games played**.  Klay - 16.6 PER / 5.3 Win Shares / **-0.3 BPM** / 1.2 VORP  Kemba - 21.7 PER / 7.4 Win Shares / 4.2 BPM / 4.4 VORP  Klay was the third option on a team with 2 top 5 players. Kemba was the minutes leader on a team he dragged to 39 wins. Here was his supporting cast, in descending minutes played -    Nic Batum, in the totally checked-out part of his career   Jeremy Lamb   A 32 year old Marvin Williams   A rookie Miles Bridges   Sophomore Malik Monk   A sometimes healthy Cody Zeller   And to close it out, 8th man, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist.  You swap Klay and Kemba that season, what do you think happens? I think Kemba gets a ring, and those Hornets don't come anywhere close to 39 wins.  The only thing that's wild to me is that in 2021 people would question this all-nba selection."
Your right we need more Ben Simmons and Klay Thompson threads
"Not typical at all, no. He was a very good bench player. As a result he won the 6MOTY once, an honor he shares with legendary shooting guard JR Smith.  And neither of them are nearly as good as Klay Thompson."
bc its such an accurate summary of Klay Thompson😂
"The game is more than scoring bud, or would you rather have Bradley Beal than a healthy Klay Thompson"
Go watch the 30 for 30 Reggie Miller vs NYC. Klay Thompson is a fucking nobody compared to Reggie Miller.
"**1. So in 2016 was Steph Curry better than he is now? That’s so unfathomable with how good this dude is now and did anyone see him having mvp potential (not unanimous) before 2015?**  I think Steph's best year is still 2016, which yes is crazy because how good he is now. We knew he was gonna be a star before 2015, but nobody saw him ever reaching this level.  **2. Ive never seen Klay Thompson play, I know about his insane shooting nights and the 60 on 11 dribbles…. But how was this guy on a regular Tuesday night game like how consistent?**  He was a Top 15 player in the league throughout the Warriors' run, but in 2019, the year he got hurt, he was kinda inconsistent. But overall, he is consistent.  **3. How was Draymonds offensive prime?**  Good. In 2016 he shot the three well while also being an elite passer  **4. Why do they call Steph Curry skyfucker? 😂**  The ball goes in the sky when he shoots, hence fucking the sky."
Sub is gonna complain about a 4th draft pick playing well but is ok talking about Klay Thompson on a boat lol
"&gt; Because Pippen could be the legit number one option on a quality team unlike Klay  History disagrees with you. Pippen without Jordan didn't do shit. He went to good teams and *made them worse*.  Whereas Klay Thompson is the absolute pinnacle of the concept of the ""3&amp;D wing"". Elite 3, elite D, doesn't require the ball in his hands. Plug him in to *any team* and that team is better."
Do we need 3 klay thompson posts on the front page despite him not even playing a game this season?
Klay Thompson is seriously my favourite Sacha Baron Cohen character
"Scottie Pippen was a 10 time All-Defensive team.  Klay Thompson has 1 All-Defensive team.  Scottie Pippen MVP voting: 9th Place, 3rd Place, 7th Place, 5th Place, 11th Place, 10th Place  Klay Thompson MVP voting: 1 singular 10th place vote  Pippen was obviously more important. Almost every person seems to agree with that."
Klay Thompson wants to know if he made your top 75.
"Klay Thompson has been fined $10,000 by the NFL for unsportsmanlike conduct"
Obligatory [Klay Thompson visits Harry Potter World video.](https://youtu.be/66cMNVRU_fs)
"Klay Thompson: I don't care about that stuff alright? Look am I curious as to why I never get nominated? Sure, yeah. Do I care? Not in the slightest. It is a little bit odd i've never been nominated. At some point it becomes a little aggressive. So what is it, I don't deserve it? I'm not cool enough? If I do something you better believe its cool. If im gonna put my name on something its gonna be award worthy. I can't imagine that other people are doing what I'm doing better. It's just putting up shots. It's just upsetting. I-I'm sorry I'm getting upset. If you wanna get a nomination you gotta play the game. I don't wanna play a game to get an award that feels lame. Oh is that your ass mmmwah! Oh closer to the hole sir mmmwah. You know what's lame being around this long and never getting an award! Makes me look like an asshole. You're really like driving this home and like its upsetting, because now im getting this neck thing. I feel... I feel.. I'm getting upset. They're making me feel like an asshole. You know what, I'll play the game, I'll kiss ass. But I wanna be very clear about something. This literally means nothing to me  *Klay Thompson Tries Desperately to Win an Award*"
...Kemba walker? Kyrie Irving? Klay Thompson? /s  Too many goddamn All-Stars starting with the letter k if you ask me 🤣🤣🤣
Was Klay Thompson ever a top 10 player in any year he's played?
"I love Klay and think he’s a total stud, but let’s not be disrespectful to Reggie Miller now  Granted, regular season Reggie Miller was nothing particularly special and wouldn’t turn all that many heads. I largely blame this on him having the same issue during the regular season that John Stockton had, which was that they were both way too unselfish for their own good and really should’ve demanded the ball more considering how good they were at scoring. (Stockton was unselfish in the sense that he would almost always rather dish out an assist than score, and Reggie Miller in the sense that he would use his offball game in a way that’d create offensive opportunities for his teammates rather than for himself). It made him widely beloved among his teammates, but it DID hurt Reggie in the stats department and it might’ve even hurt his teams slightly in the long run during the regular season   But PLAYOFFS Reggie Miller??? Playoffs Reggie Miller was an absolute BEAST who was a genuine terror to play against. The undisputed GOAT shooter before Steph Curry came along and was the godfather of the current 3-point era we’re living in right now, which Steph Curry himself will attest to   Despite never having had the luxury of playing with another HOF talent (I know he played with Chris Mullins once, but Chris was 38 and a shell of his former self), Reggie still managed to force Michael Jordan’s Bulls to 7 games (only team to do that) in the ECF, and even managed to force the Kobe-Shaq Bulls to 6 games in the finals when he himself was 35. He carried his teams to the playoffs almost every single year in a ridiculously stacked East  My family lived in Chicago during the 90s, and Reggie Miller was unquestionably the player they feared the most  So while I would say that Klay Thompson is amazing, I think that we’re all going overboard in saying that he has a better resume than Reggie imo"
"We remember.   We also remember that somebody else was on that team. LeBron something something ... maybe you've heard of him?  If winning one title as the second-best player on the team is enough, then where's Kyle Lowry? Where's Klay Thompson? Where's Manu Ginobilli? Where's Kyrie? Joe Dumars?   The list - aside from halos around the '80s Lakers, '80s Celtics, and '90s Bulls - clearly puts more stock in being the #1 guy on a not-great team than it does in putting the #2 guy on a title winner.   You value what AD did more than, say, Pete Maravich? Totally. But by that metric, AD isn't a particularly egregious snub - there are several players in line ahead of him who have better accomplishments than ONE run as the second-best player on a title team.   The Clyde Drexler comparison is interesting, and gets to the challenge. We know what AD can do as the #1 guy on his team ... and it's not as good as what Clyde did. But if Clyde had been teammates with Jordan, rather than rivals (and that almost happened! Portland brass wanted to draft Jordan and were overruled by the owner, according to the rumors) Clyde would have won multiple titles."
"Bro what? Draymond is one of the keys of the Warriors offense. He's practically their quarterback. He's got Steph Curry and Klay Thompson as his receivers and he knows how to use them to their max. He's just weak as a dribbler and shooter, but as long as he doesn't try to use those things too much, his value on offense is also elite, not just his defense."
Def not Lakers. I like the warriors this year. Klay Thompson isn’t even playing and they’re already playing at a high level. I used to be a huge lebron fan but Lakers only have star power and that’s it. No real team chemistry. Just some stars so people can come watch them lose.
"Nate Archibald, Dave Cowens, Billy Cunningham, Dave DeBusschere, Jerry Lucas, Earl Monroe, Robert Parish, Bill Sharman, Wes Unseld, Lenny Wilkens.  Do you think they all deserve a spot over Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard or Klay Thompson?"
When will the Klay Thompson circlejerk stop
KLAY Thompson?
"Jrue, Rondo and Mirotic get at *least* equal credit for sweeping Portland. Jrue and Rondo were suffocating and Mirotic was looking like Klay Thompson for some reason."
And if Klay Thompson was never injured and the blood moon rose in the east during the summer solstice. Give the Suns their fucking due. Best team in the NBA rn
This felt like a Klay Thompson game
Myers about to panic and acquire Wiseman and Klay Thompson.
Yeah might have turned out differently if   ****Checks notes****  Klay Thompson and James Wiseman were healthy
Klay Thompson watching Jae Crowder: *I’m pussy?!*
If you told me Steph was 3-17 I’d assume the warriors were losing by 20. Shoutout to their depth it’s insane. Can’t believe klay Thompson is about to be added to this team
Klay USB Thompson
"As long as klay is PHYSICALLY ok then they will see an immediate boost in defense. If klay comes out shooting even half as good as before they will feast.   Why? Cuz steph has figured out how to kill even thru a permanent double team. So if the other team doesn't adjust at all and still double teams steph but leaves klay open he will find his shot and make them pay. So steph would be passing to wide open klay Thompson in the corner or wing instead of Wiggins or Poole or whoever is sitting at the 2 spot. On top of steph still doing steph things.   If they DO adjust and account for klay, a defender MUST stay home on him at all times. This essentially breaks the double team strategy any team would want to use just off Klays gravity. So now the new and improved steph gets to eat against single coverage."
&gt; Will Klay Thompson returning actually help immediately?  Yes.

Klay “Younger Toguro” Thompson
"&gt; Also guys are definitely going to testing him with Blocking fouls/Charges just to see what he can handle.  I think you are overestimating how much Klay Thompson drives into traffic.  Klay drives if you leave him an open lane, if not he shoots from outside or passes."
"I remember when half the Warriors offense was trying to iso Klay Thompson in the post against smaller guards. Love Klay but that was not his game, nor a good use of one of the most efficient spot up shooters ever."
"Teammates plural?  Our third best player is Patty Mills lol  Other title contenders' third best players are Jrue Holiday, Klay Thompson(when he comes back), and DeAndre Ayton  We have the much better #2 of course but thanks to Kyrie we pay a big price for that from #3 on down  If anything you seem to be obsessed with reiterating that the Nets are favorites just so you can clown us if we lose"
Exactly. Send him to Rio Grande Valley. Klay Thompson is willing to do it with Santa Cruz.
Imagine being in the G League and having to play against fucking Klay Thompson
"Klay Thompson, he is not."
"No. But these are g leaguers, and he's Klay Thompson. There's no possible way for them to play good enough defense to not make it easy af for him."
"We talking about PRACTICE?? In all seriousness, I am really happy for him and only want him to succeed. NBA is much better/entertaining with player like Klay Thompson playing in it."
Klay Thompson vs OKC in game 6. My favorite Klay moment.
HE'S NO KLAY THOMPSON.
I know it's close to impossible but I'm rooting for dark horse Klay Thompson
His form is still a tad wacky -- he's no Klay Thompson -- but he can fire it from wherever even if he's mostly doing it with catch-and-shoot 3's.
His form looks way better than at UCLA or early in the career but he sure as hell doesn't look like Klay Thompson. But it definitely works.
"He's no Klay Thompson, but his form has improved a lot. Definitely not shooting from the wrong side of his head anymore."
"I wouldn't say over. They are still a focal point of a team.   As long as the floor spacing and rules don't change. Pgs will continue to dominant.   The only position that took a huge swing of things was the shooting guard position. Went from Ray Allen ,Tracy McGrady , kobe, Vince Carter, dwade, Allen iverson , Reggie Miller to just   klay Thompson and James harden were the only consistent shooting guards.  As of writing this. There isn't a dominant shooting guard anymore a team is built around"
Nikola “Klay “Steph “Ray “Reggie Miller” Allen” Curry” Thompson” Vucevic
"Wagners now too. And Klay Thompson has a brother in the pros, an MLB outfielder."
"I don't think play style is as closely tied to injuries as people think. Klay Thompson has basically the safest play style in theory yet he's had two major injuries since 2019 while Russ has been relatively injury-free his whole career despite crashing into defenders at full speed like 25 times in every game.   When players get injured, people want there to be a specific reason when in reality sometimes shit just happens and you can't predict it."
Good luck trying to convice Klay Thompson to come off the bench
Never forget the media voted him 3rd team All-Pro in 2019 costing Klay Thompson $30M.  Never forget Klay....
Nah gotta be Kerr. No one had them dominating the league like this... without Klay Thompson.
Remember that Klay Thompson got snubbed because of Kemba
Steph Curry  Klay Thompson  Andre Iguodala   Kevin Durant   Draymond Green  It’s pretty obvious why they targeted Steph.

"Imagine you're in the G League, it's your first game and you have to guard Klay Thompson. lmfao"
"No mean we all get it. Harden is fat (no evidence), Klay Thompson looks amazing (no evidence), KD was instantly in shape and a superstar (ignoring he missed 60% of the season). Kawhi looks amazing (ignoring he is missing half his games because of constant load management). When people don't agree with your moronic postulations it doesn't mean ""they don't understand"" it means you can't just claim something and expect it to be true because you say so. Your claims are completely inchoherent and nonsensical.     Stop being such a little snowflake."
"Ask after Tuesday when he gets put in Mikal Jail &gt;:)  Jokes aside though, he’s just been on a new level, even by his standards. Some of the plays he was making and shots he was draining during the Clippers game were just horrifying to watch as a Suns fan(or a fan of any team the warriors face haha)  AND he’s playing like this and leading his team like this without the boating legend Klay Thompson so the defense can tune into and pay a bit more attention to Steph. AND he’s improved his defense this year? 20 games in hes certainly the MVP, but there’s a lot of basketball left to be played.  If he keeps playing even 80% of what he’s doing now he wins it unanimously though ez"
"Don't forget folks, Klay ""not top 75"" Thompson is coming back with vengence and hungry. League fucked"
"&gt; I legitimately don’t know where the narrative of him being a bad defender came from.  He used to get targeted on switches by other teams.  Notably, when the rest of the defensive lineup was Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant.  The ""no shit Steph is the weak link"" lineup. Did you know he's also a worse rim protector than Rudy Gobert?"
"I think it would have to depend on the person receiving the pass as I was saying.  If you pass to a wide open Klay Thompson on a corner 3 where he probably shoots over,50% it would count as a ""good shot"" maybe giving like .5 assist in addition to the 1.0 from making it (while still getting the .5 even if he misses).  You'd have to know the statistics of each person but I don't think that would be that hard to find with today's tech.  And on the other side, passing to a double-teamed Dwight Howard from 3 would only get you you 1.0 assist if he somehow makes it, because it's not a good shot.  Could even say that whether that shot is made or not still counts as nothing, with the players shot percentage from where they take it dictating the amount of points they get from the pass.  After typing this I have realized that I didn't take player development/slumps/ start of a season into consideration.  This is probably a lot more difficult to measure than I initially thought."
"Cavs. There's a lot of revisionism around the 2016 Warriors.  Suddenly Andrew Bogut is this DPOY defender that would've swung two blow outs and stopped LeBron's reign of terror even though he was done laterally, playing 14 minutes a night and not even closing out games for the Dubs.  And Draymond would've without question swung the game where Golden State got blown out, even though he came back next game and they still got blown out.  LeBron James was even better in the 2017, Klay Thompson was having a terrible post-season, Gimme the Cavs in 6 if they meet again."
Fully healthy Warriors? I think they'd take it. Looking at the depth charts:  Steph + Livingston &gt; Kyrie + any other Cavs guard  Klay + Barbosa &gt; Iman Shumpert + J.R. Smith   Harrison Barnes + Iguodala &lt; LeBron + Jefferson  Draymond + McAdoo = Love + Derrick Williams  Bogut + Speights/Ezeli ≥ Thompson + Channing Frye  You're relying on LeBron to make up for disadvantage at 2 or 3 other positions. I think that's too much.
"nah iirc klay thompson is an above the rim, high flying, james worthy type player   right?"
All I want for Christmas is Klay Thompson
"Realistically, Steph ’22 is even more better than Steph ’16 than it appears.  In 2016, nobody knew how to defend Steph and the Warriors.  Now, 5 full seasons later, every team in the league has had plenty of time to figure out the best way to slow him down.  …and he’s putting up even better numbers today than he was back then, even after defenses have tried to adjust, and he’s doing it without Klay Thompson on the court.  Plus his own defensive level has improved as well."
"“…the G-league record for most 3s in a game has been completely obliterated, as both teams chose to inbound the ball directly to their Thompson brother on every possession, and played zero defense all game. This was quite literally a 3-point shooting contest, in which Klay came out on top with a staggering 140 made baskets.”"

&gt; Gabe Vincent became Klay Thompson in that 4th quarter  RSBK
"Gabe Vincent became Klay Thompson in that 4th quarter. If I'm a Bulls fan, I'd be furious lmao  Felt like we were gonna crap our pants with another bad 4th Q just like we did vs Minnesota and then Gabe/Lowry went to another stratosphere. Hell of a win vs a damn good team."
"Yeah, but that doesn’t mean a good scorer can’t be a ball stopper. It means that the ball stopper shouldn’t also be the lead ballhandler.  Klay Thompson is a good example. He’s always been a ball stopper but it’s not an issue because he doesn’t handle the ball much and his average time of possession is very low. But he does shoot nearly every time he touches it."
Klay thompson &gt; Anthony Davis   It's not even close
"the defensive intensity isn't there. you've got AD thinking he's KD, got clowned by KAT in his own house. Lebron started chucking like he's channeling Klay Thompson - shit is just not fun to watch"
"Overrated! How AD got in the ‘top 75’ over Klay Thompson is complete bullshit and reeks of Lebron/lakers interference. Compare the pair AD one title which comes with an asterix (bubble) multiple all star appearances, multiple all nab teams and and all star mvp. Klay 3x titles, multiple all star appearances, multiple all defensive first and second teams, multiple all nba second teams and scored 37 in a quarter and 60 on just 11 dribbles but mainly 3 x titles compared to one with a big asterix."
"That's cool and all but ""Thompson""?  ""Klay"" is one of the most badass sounding chants I can think of."
The problem is these guys aren't playing to their strengths. Lebron shouldn't be shooting more than 6 three pointers in a game. AD and RW shouldn't be shooting more than 2 three pointers in a game. These guys should focus on points in the paint primarily and if that doesn't work then focus on the mid range game because points in the paint emphasizes their size and athleticism advantage on most matchups.    You can't shoot threes like you are Klay Thompson or Stephen Curry.  Lebron is average to decent at three point efficiency and AD and RW are god awful at three point efficiency. It's a wasted possession unless you are completely open for both AD and RW taking a three.
"This team is gonna win another cup…the signs are all there for a deep playoff run, if not win the whole thing: -	blowout wins -	deep bench -	can win without their key rotation players (like tonight with just a 10 man squad!) -	chemistry and total buy-in with everyone in the squad -	…and winning games comprehensively without Klay “77” Thompson! You add Klay to this group, and they will become even more unstoppable!!"
Marcus Thompson on Twitter said klay was getting “Thomp-son” chants from the crowd. Gonna be so loud when he gets back
are we sure that's Klay Thompson?
"There was a video in the offseason when JB was making a bunch of threes and he jokingly said ""I'm the black Klay Thompson.""   And tbh, he really is.  He's an incredible shooter and a good man defender, so that's why people value him so highly, his strengths are visceral, you *see* them."
I thought they would be contenders but I really didn't expect them to be the best team in the league without Klay Thompson.  The team just plays so well together it's insane. Steve Kerr and the coaching staff should get alot of credit for this turn around.
Oh it's definitely on them for losing that series. I just don't buy the narrative that KD couldn't possibly win with Russ when they were a Klay Thompson super quarter away from their second finals in 4 years.
And they moved Monte to get Bogut to build around Curry and Klay Thompson.  They were not looking to build around Bogut.  Again they decided to rebuild and finished outside the playoffs.  Sacramento is actively trying to make the playoffs.
"Awful post lmao  &gt;He has NEVER been considered the best player in the league, nor the 2,3,4 or 5th best.  After the bubble ring he was commonly considered the 5th best player until he had to sit out most the next year with injuries. The take was that he was a dpoy level center who could guard/play on the perimeter and was shooting 60/40/85ish from the field and 50% from midrange, which is insane efficiency.   &gt;Klay Thompson has always been better than AD.   This is not true, since at worst AD is a top 10/12 player and Klay has never been mentioned on that level. It's not true to the media/coaches because AD has more all nba teams, more all nba first teams, and more all defensive teams. Sentimentality aside, if the lakers offered a 1:1 swap of the two Kerr would be dropping Klay at the airport before the end of the day.   Plus calling AD an underperformer or inconsistent is funny af considering Klay is streaky as fuck. Sometimes he hits 14 3s or carries a game 6,but there are many playoff series and games where he was completely invisible on the offensive end."
"I agree.  Anthony Davis is the most glaring admission to the list for me.  He has always been regarded for his potential, and what he could do, or seemingly will do.  Every year, he's been ranked in the top 5 or 10 players because people think he CAN do that, but he rarely has.  He has NEVER been considered the best player in the league, nor the 2,3,4 or 5th best.  He's just always had a high ceiling, but his play and result are far from that.  Klay Thompson has always been better than AD.  AD would have been better in the 80's... but its not the 80's.    Here are the facts: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02.html"
Klay thompson
Except this sub creams itself everytime the name “Klay Thompson” comes up
"Well when Curry gets hot like that there’s nothing you can do. Even with no klay thompson, durant, and the box and one the Raptors could barely contain steph. If it went to game 7 in Oakland the Splash bros probably take it anyways"
If his movement and mobility is hindered a bit Klay Thompson could be basically like a taller + better Joe Harris which is still a valuable player who scales exceptionally well with Curry.   We’ll have too see how he’s doing when he returns but he has plenty of time to get back into true playing shape for the playoffs (considering how well Warriors have been without him)
"Since the Greek freak is a center hybrid and bron,kd,and pg can all get rebounds good enough for their positions you could replace embid for klay Thompson and not loose much defense but gain hall of fame level shooting and spacing without much need to handle the rock a lot"
"The gap between Curry and prime Harden isn’t that big and the difference between CP3 and Klay Thompson isn’t even worth discussing. Both Harden and CP3 are franchise leading players, Klay isn’t even an all-star without being on the same team as the greatest point guard of all time and the greatest playmaking PF of all time"
"Klay Thompson? Ball handler? The same Klay Thompson who famously scored 60 points on just 11 dribbles?  He's not a ball handler first and he is probably one of the best off-ball movers in the game. He doesn't need the ball in his hands to make plays, he's a catch and shoot player. He's already next to Steph who is another one of best at moving off the ball.  Put them both next to Lonzo and you have ridiculous playmaking to set up ridiculous shooters."
"Yep. That's what I noticed right away, especially when there was that whole thing of ""Curry has not scored in *x* fourth quarters in a row!"", it was like yeah and we're still winning. That never happens the last two years. What really should scare everyone though is Klay's return. Because now when you double team Steph that means you're giving up an open drive to the lane from Dray or Wiggins, or you're gonna let Klay Thompson shoot from the corner wide open."
I think if klay is just a spot up shooter he’s still effective. But he won’t be the klay Thompson we know then. He’ll be closer to joe Harris type player
Pascal if he gets back to his precovid self can be as deadly as Klay Thompson to some Steph Curry. I really want to see Pascal paired with Dame someday. This would be such a deadly combo.
"If Draymond Green is your teams key player in a finals series where Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are on the roster, your team is in trouble."
Mitch Richmond. Absolute star but didn't play for the glamour sides so his record gets overlooked but it stacks up against some absolute greats. It makes me laugh that Klay Thompson can think he's stiff missing the top 75 when blokes like this missed out.
Down by 19 to winning by 10. Just Warrior's things. Also heard this guy named Klay Thompson is coming back in 3 weeks...
"I read Slater every day you bozo:  https://theathletic.com/2707239/2021/07/19/steve-kerr-details-the-kenny-atkinson-hire-warriors-coaching-changes-and-gives-a-klay-thompson-update/  1) There is zero evidence that Bob had any direct hand in coaching staff moves -- Kerr recruited the new hires  2) Kerr has said he thinks coaching staffs need fresh blood and new energy periodically  3) All of the Arizona buddies that left, left for promotions on other teams (Luke and Gentry got HC gigs, Collins got bumped up to lead assistant in NO)"
Klay Thompson and The OneOne Ring
The one ring is named Klay Thompson.
Are we just gonna forget Klay Thompson?
I heard they still have Klay Thompson to return too
"JTA yelled, “There you go!” Andrew Wiggins gave a look of pleasant surprise. Draymond Green belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Stephen Curry hit the locker room door, injured Warriors star Klay Thompson hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"CP3, Westbrook, Rondo, and even Reddit’s beloved Klay Thompson have done it."
I like the Warriors chances. It all depends on Klay Thompson healthy because that’s enough for a Western Conference Finals loss to the Thunder.
Klay Thompson got a Bucks fan ejected for talking trash to him in 2018 lmao
"If my goal is to win a basketball game for my life I’m just choosing the best most talented players ever who can mild into just about any scheme or systems. This is gonna skew hard to modern players from within the last 30 years also it’s 2021 and this is the era of position-less basketball so I’m gonna put players at whatever position I want to       Guards- Steph Curry, Michael Jordan, Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant, Klay Thompson   Forwards- Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Larry Bird  Bigs- Hakeem Olajuwon, Tim Duncan, Giannis    Just crazy defensive versatility with this team and it’s full of shooting and elite interior scoring. Lots of players who can create a mid range and I wanted a large collection of stars who can also play well off the ball and can have impact if they aren’t touching the ball much."
"PG: Curry, Wade  SG: Jordan, Allen  SF: Klay Thompson  PF: LeBron, Bird  C: Duncan, Shaq  Tbh thats the whole rotation. Playoff teams run 9 man rotations anyways.  Curry and Thompson are very overlooked pieces for all-time lineups, given that they're two of the best off-ball players ever. Allen is just gravy from a shooting perspective  Jordan and LeBron are the two best players ever  Bird is the perfect stretch 4 for the modern NBA  Duncan brings great defense, shoots the midrange great, and can clean up around the rim as good as anyone  Shaq and Wade would make amazing use of the space provided by curry, Thompson, allen, and bird"
"Ahh yes, the Klay Thompson- Sacramento Kings rivalry. A classic."
Let me present to you the fat [Klay Thompson](https://youtu.be/zJqnpoJPDMM)
I am happy to see a resurgent Warriors team.  Mainly because they are built from the ground up through the draft and I hate LeBron's ring-chasing super-teams.  I want to see a Golden State vs Brooklyn NBA Finals with Klay Thompson and Kyrie both back playing.
I mean we don’t have klay thompson this year.
Because Lebron doesn’t also have prime Klay Thompson and Draymond Green
"The strategy is not ""concede wide open 3's"", its ""force the teams worst outside shooters to shoot from outside"". People act like they're leaving Steph Curry or Klay Thompson open in the corner 10 times a game or something like that.  Everyone always says ""if someone gets hot the defense is exposed!"" and yes thats one of the risks. But every strategy comes with risks and they have enough sample size over the past 3 seasons that it works on pretty much every team. You dont get the #1 defense over 2 whole seasons (and currently #4 this season) by simply ""conceding wide open 3s"". No matter how good a team is overall at shooting, almost every team has at least one sub-par shooter on the floor at all times and the Bucks defense is particular about funneling the shots to those guys.   Beating the defense is more about not having any bad shooters than it is about having a few elite shooters. For the most part they're at least making life difficult for those guys. It comes down to the 30% shooters shooting well enough on the wide open shots to not only punish the defense, but do it enough to outscore the Bucks perenially top 5 (this year so far #1) offense. Which is obviously doable as we've seen in the playoffs these past years but its not simply ""shooters getting hot off of wide open 3s"""
Klay Thompson
Klay Thompsons usage never decreased with Durant. Currys dipped slightly but so did durants from okc. Thompson barely sacrificed any shots. Curry sacrificed a bit from 2016
"Steph happily took a backseat but Klay ""I'm not sacrificing shit"" Thompson didn't and I'm pretty sure he lead the warriors in shots."
"The issue is, is that we're not getting steph curry and klay thompson back the next year. The core is playing and this is what they are (Siakam and FVV are actually playing well too).   If they land in a position that gets them a top 5 pick it simply means that they aren't a good team and will need to fully rebuild."
The warriors already have players called Steph Curry and Klay Thompson.
"yep, also the % of their shots that are assisted/unassisted  i mean, Klay Thompson has higher career usage rate than Chris Paul lol"
don’t take shots at the second coming of klay thompson like that Joey buckets has game
Steph still won it with Klay Thompson and Draymond on his team. Having an all star team mate doesn’t change the narrative of mvp which is usually best player on the best team.
"it wasn't common but ""there's only one ball"" was a reaction, even gobert tweeted it https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/07/nba-golden-state-warriors-kevin-durant-fits-shots-steph-curry-klay-thompson"
Fuck No Fuck No Fuck. No. Idk when you started watching nba but idk what the fuck you think kyrie Irving has done that makes him better or more valueable than Klay Thompson
"Jrue is just the perfect fit with this Nets team. Imo a third star is almost always redundant, unless said star is able to become an elite role player (Ray Allen, Klay Thompson, Chris Bosh. Counter example is Kevin Love).   Jrue just works wonders for the defense, and in offense his skills don't go to waste.  This is even without mentioning that you will get to keep Allen and/or LeVert if not more."
"Klay Thompson was the premier 3, and D guard in the league before his injury. Green has 2 DPOY.  That has nothing to do with the front office, or Kerr. That was all training from before Kerr took the job. Mark Jackson put that dog into them. You all kids hate people who are demanding, but demanding people get results. Mark, for all his crazy tactics, demanded they play tough defense. Draymond, and Klay were arguably the 2 most important defensive pieces on that team. Despite Boguts claims, he was just a token big man who's job was made easier by the outstanding team defense.   Gotta give Jackson his due. Hate on everything else, but to not give him credit for molding them into defensive players, is just silly."
Agree with you Curry was so well liked and they played conventional basketball that analysts ate up and praised.   Klay Thompson is also the least hated NBA player ever
GUYS we are about to trade for Klay Thompson also!!!
Imagine you had Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and you were calling Isos for Harrison Barnes
Dude was like Klay Thompson versus us this year
The Allen/Pierce/Garnett Big 3 was way more balanced skill-wise on both sides of the ball than a Kyrie/Harden/KD Big 3 would be. I don't know how anyone can't see the problems waiting to arise. I don't see any of those three accepting the Klay Thompson role. Kyrie and Harden will have many bad defensive nights. And they still have nothing down low to counter Anthony Davis. Basketball is not always as simple as who has more stars like you think or the Lakers would've beat the Pistons in 2004. Plus the 2010 Celtics lost to a two star Laker team.
"LeBron James, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant. He's not the only superstar"
"You got me thinking, how do you rate selflessness? No doubt Curry is selfless but so are other superstars. Take LeBron for example, he’s regularly let other players take big shots if it was the right play. Klay Thompson May not be a superstar but he’s selfless as hell. He doesn’t try to go above his role even tho he could be averaging more ppg. There’s other players that I didn’t mention like Lillard, Butler, Tatum and maybe a few more who could be viewed as selfless as well.   Just curious as to why you chose to say Curry is the most selfless player of his generation. I’m not going to argue against it I just want to know what your criteria is."
Mark jackson called steph curry and klay thompson the best shooting backcourt of all time and people laughed at him
fantastic coach? lmao damn I don’t remember this ever. I remember the warriors getting continually bounced in the second round and him setting up Iso plays for Klay Thompson lol.
Jordan today would shoot like 80% from threes during the playoffs if he played in this generation because he'd be tired of people saying klay thompson is a better shooter than him
Klay Thompson
"This is an utterly laughable list, beyond keeping Kyrie off of it. Klay Thompson as the 8th best player in the league? Giannis as number 4?? Harden as 10??? Honey."
Apparently Oubre has become Klay Thompson this game so if he keeps this up we might make it to the second round
Klay Thompson is in the building!
Damion “Klay Thompson” Lee
Players on the court this game:  - 2013 Finals Danny Green - Joel 'The Mailman' Embiid - Tyler 'Reggie Miller' Herro - Duncan 'Klay Thompson Who?' Robinson
"&gt; Are you saying that LeBrons assists are product of him being a ball hog like old rondo? Is that really the hill you want to die on? I guess LeBrons passing doesn’t help the team. It’s amazing that he’s had so much success stat padding.   I mean no one is saying that, except you. I was saying that there is no evidence to suggest that a Lebron assist is somehow more valuable for his team than any other random assist made by random player is for theirs, and by your answer i will assume that you don't have any evidence for that.      &gt; And this year he hasn’t been nearly as good defensively which is my whole point. They both average around 9 rebounds a game. Last year lebron averaged a whopping 7 more assists a game. That’s the difference in Chris Paul and Klay Thompson. Interesting.   Trying to decide who is the most valuable player on a sample size of the first 9-11 games in a shortened seasons, kind of tells me where you are with the whole concept of using stats in a structured argument.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Hakeem averaged way more points and rebounds than CP3. You are legit brain dead dude. You have no ability to think logically whatsoever by your continuous shit analogies. Find a player who scores at a very similar rate to another player but averages 7 less assists and is just as good offensively. I will wait.   Its kind of funny that you are calling me brain dead, and then asking me to find two players who scores roughly the samme but has 7 less assists, when your knock on Hakeem was that he has more rebounds than CP3, a stat that wasnt mentioned. Its like you forget what you were asking for in the time it took you too type those two lines.     Hakeem averaged 21,8 points a game for his career to CP3's 18,4, which is 3,4 points difference. CP3 also averaged 9,5 assists a game to Hakeems 2,0 which is exactly a 7 point difference. Hakeeem was a much better offensive player than Chris Paul. There is also Tim Duncan, who averaged 0,6p more than C3P and 6,5 assists less. I can find more if you are to slow to get the idea."

There are much better impact metrics like BPM, RPM, Raptor which favored Lebron.   Lebron is a much better offensive player. It’s mind blowing that you are arguing against that when they score at nearly identical rates but lebron is miles better as a passer. How exactly is AD making up for that?   Hakeem averaged way more points and rebounds than CP3. You are legit brain dead dude. You have no ability to think logically whatsoever by your continuous shit analogies. Find a player who scores at a very similar rate to another player but averages 7 less assists and is just as good offensively. I will wait."
"I think the circle jerk may be moving too far now, being the 2nd best player on a lebron-led championship team is still a MAJOR accomplishment.    Obviously not KD/Steph level, but he’s clearly got some accomplishments and it doesn’t make sense to dismiss them just because they came alongside Lebron, in the same way we don’t downplay Kevin McHale/Scottie Pippen/Klay Thompson and other great second bananas."
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"
Man I'd love to watch Klay Thompson play center.
Klay Thompson
"Damn I’m late to this! But I look just like you or you look just like me. I guess it can be the first one since you’re a sick basketball player and all, reluctantly tho. Wouldn’t it be cool if I had your jersey and I could be like that fake Klay Thompson guy but for you. Hmm damn"
"I'm 6'4"" without shoes. That means I am taller than...  - Steph Curry - Kyrie Irving - Russell Westbrook - Donovan Mitchell - John Wall - Kemba Walker - Kyle Lowry - Fred VanVleet  ... among others, and three inches or less shorter than:  - Kawhi Leonard - Jimmy Butler - DeMar DeRozan - Zach LaVine - OG Anunoby - Draymond Green  - Klay Thompson  ... yet I am the complete opposite of an athlete lol"
Article says 11 dribbles *all game*  https://www.sbnation.com/2016/12/6/13854272/klay-thompson-highlights-stats-scoring-60-points &gt; Golden State’s star guard touched the ball 52 times and took just 11 dribbles all game. His total time of possession — 90 seconds — averages out to 1.73 seconds per touch.
Klay Thompson
Kyle Korver/Steph/ Rip Hamilton / Klay Thompson
"Steph Curry - This is why. There is no team in the NBA  that when game planning against Golden State fails to mention guarding Steph on the perimeter. It is the #1 priority for every single opponent. This year it has been amplified even more this with the loss of Klay Thompson. Teams are willing to send a double the second Steph touches the ball regardless whom it leaves open. The gravity he has on the court is like no other due to the fact that he needs to be guarded the moment he passes half court. That borderline paranoia that is ingrained in the opponents carries when guarding Steph off ball. Even when he doesn’t touch the ball, defenses are not willing to help off of Steph. This makes life easier for his team mates. Steph curry standing still without the ball in his hands has more impact on the court than almost anyone to ever play the game. That being said, the man almost never stands still. He’s always moving and if he touches the ball with 1 inch of space there is like %40 chance Golden State gets 3."
"My short and no way definitive list from what I've watched in my life.  Ray Allen, Rip Hamilton, Klay Thompson, Steph Curry.  Honorable mentions to Danny Green, James Jones, and Mike Miller."
"Curry's probably     yeah, where Klay Thompson dropped 60 points"
"And he has the potential to go the curry path. Yes, he doesn't have klay Thompson or a point forward center like draymond, but he has to really good players around him that are starting to figure things out.  I would love for him to be the guy that moves around so much that teams struggle to keep up with him. I would love for him to be the guy who draws so much attention that his shooters are wide open. I want that."
What do you think about the comparisons between you and Klay Thompson? You're two of my favorite players in the league and it definitely feels like there's something there.  Cheers!
"Pretty sure I'm the only one who remembers this, but back in the memphis days one game klay thompson started to get frustrated from bumping with Gasol all game so he resulted to start pushing marc with both arms. Gasol still didn't budge"
Imagine the Warriors not having Klay Thompson and somehow still being the most entertaining basketball team to watch this season.
[here's one](https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2020/04/kevin-durant-thought-stephen-curry-klay-thompson-played-the-wrong-way-before-leaving-warriors-per-draymond-green.html)  i'd suggest watching draymond's interview on all the smoke.
"Injuries are part of the game but what im saying is the Raptors win was way luckier than the Warriors over Cavs. What are you not getting? But since you wanna talk about the Warriors luck, let's also mentioned their misfortunes during their dynasty.  2016 1st Rd vs Rockets: unanimous MVP Curry sprains his knee in the 1st round, sidelining him for a few games.   2016 Finals vs Cavs: Andrew Bogut suffers a knee injury in game 5 and is ruled out for the rest of the series.   2019 DMC tore his left quad in game 2 vs clippers   2019 Rockets/Raptors: Kevin Durant has a calf injury vs the Rockets and is sidelined for a majority of the playoffs. After the Warriors go down 3-1, KD comes back to play game 5 and promptly tears his achilles and is declared out for an entire year.  2019 Kevon Looney fractures his collar bone in game 2.  He sat out game 3 but returned for game 4.  2019 Klay Thompson misses game 3(Raptors win) due to hamstring strain but returns for game 4  2019 Klay Thompson suffers an ACL tear midway through a very close game in game 6    SOOO tell me again who's finals win was the luckiest."
Linebacker Klay Thompson.
Get Klay Thompson a bionic leg
tie between jr smith and klay thompson. my money's on jr.
"This one always comes to mind when I think of everything these 3 have been through together    https://movietvtechgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Draymond-Green-Klay-Thompson-Hold-Down-Warriors-in-Steph-Curry’s-Absence-2016-images.jpg  I especially enjoy the fact that I’m not sure if Klay is paying attention or lost, staring into the stands"
"so Klay Thompson is down a season and the Warriors are one of the worst west teams...  if Jokic was to go down, the core of Jamal Murray would not make the Nuggets a likely contender, and easily at the Bottom of the West. Ya think that’s crazy? Do you watch Basketball? Murray put up insane numbers in the bubble, but so did Jokic. Jokic is consistent, Murray is still a bit streaky."
"PG - Steph Curry  SG- Klay Thompson  SF- Kevin Durant  PF- Lebron James  C- Hakeem Olajuwon  Everyone's answers are a bit flawed because they assume their players can play together efficiently.   Steph, klay, kevin already know how to play together. Replace draymond role with Lebron and get Hakeem as your center for defense/rebounds.  They would never lose."
"Modern NBA? Too easy  PG - Steph Curry  SG- Klay Thompson  SF- Kevin Durant  PF- Lebron James  C- Hakeem Olajuwon  Everyone's answers are a bit flawed because they assume their players can play together.  Steph, klay, kevin already know how to play together. Replace draymond role with lebron and get Hakeem as your center for defense.  &amp;#x200B;  They would never lose. All unselfish, all can pass and score. all play effort defense."
"I’m not so sure about that. Most these guys have lived and breathed basketball their whole lives as kids. Whether it’s D Rose playing all day on an East Chicago court trying to steer clear of gangbangers or Klay Thompson playing at Chesterfield Manor Boys School, they were all playing all day since they were toddlers."
Lol that was with that starting lineup with Perdue and Robinson. Absolute absurdity. Duncan was curling off of screens like Klay Thompson and raining down catch and shoot 20 footers.
"What? Top 15? Are you properly out of your mind? Top 30, maybe. Top 15, you’re crazy. Klay Thompson was MAYBE a top 15 player at one point, not Draymond Green."
&gt; My 2 cents: Steph Curry is turning into Klay Thompson in front of our eyes with how icy hot and streaky he is this season  Considering this was your take from a day ago not sure your opinion matters lol
"Actually yeah that makes sense, because then we can do this:  - Bradley Beal - Jrue Holiday - Klay Thompson - DeMar DeRozan - James Harden - Zach LaVine"
SG is pretty loaded tbh  - James Harden - Bradley Beal - Klay Thompson - DeMar DeRozan - ??? - Zach LaVine  No idea who'd play the 5 though.
"Gotta agree lol THJ is the definition of a coinflip player, he either looks like the biggest chucker in the league or like Klay Thompson when he broke the record for most poins in a quarter"
Hes not and never was better than klay thompson.
Hes not and never was better than klay thompson.
He’s a smaller version of Klay Thompson
"Ayeeee what a stat OP, man listen, the bay found their Harrison Barnes, even if kell has to share that with Wiggins- even better! Steph doing gods work for that organization if they end up fighting for a spot. Buuuut same org has a Klay Thompson slow roasting in the oven for a feast of 37 year old Bron next year. Tooshay"
"Basketball Reference has Jimmy at a 43% chance right now, or 20th among active players. I'm not sure how accurate the model is, but it's interesting. It has Lamarcus Aldridge as 50%, the definition of a coinflip right now. I think this model underrates Klay Thompson- If you just looked at a guy on paper with his career resume then maybe it's reasonable, but in reality I think there's 0% chance Klay doesn't get in.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof\_prob.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html)"
"Man this season is weird, never thought I would like the warriors especially without Klay  Thompson"
"I mean there are some awful takes on this sub, but Warriors core of Curry/Klay/Green+Wiggins/Wisemen would easily be title contenders. I mean why wouldn't they? You're replacing Oubre with Klay Thompson. That's a massive difference."
By having Steph Curry and Klay Thompson
But that means the next Klay Thompson will pass Kareem in 15 years.
"Steph's peak is also much higher than Magic's peak. I don't actually care if the ball left Steph's hands as an assist, his gravity as a shooter and off-ball mover creates offense whether he touches it or not. Steph spent five years as the best player on the best five year run since the Russell Celtics--did he have help? Sure. But Klay Thompson has had a whole ass career as an all-star because he's getting to play with Steph. He's slightly better Davis Bertans who gets a bazillion open looks because teams have to show for a PnR at the logo when Steph is on the court."
"Warriors are on 🔥 right now, but I miss watching Klay Thompson light up 😕 literally no one can get as hot as him in the entire league"
Klay Thompson was all NBA third team and a borderline all star he doesn't count as a true star yet
Klay thompson doesn't exist I guess.
"Dave Lee, Klay Thompson just stop"
"Tough to put us over the Lakers this year, but we’ve been one Klay Thompson away from punching the teams we’ve faced in the mouth pretty clearly (sorry, Kelly...)"
"Watching a game like this I almost forget we're supposed to have Klay Thompson out there too, this team could have been really good this year with him out there instead of Kelly Oubre bricking shots and fucking up the offense. Hopefully Klay makes a full recovery and comes back in peak form next year, seeing KD look so good has made me more optimistic about it"
Klay Thompson. That’s all.
We are a Klay Thompson away from being a contender again
someone like klay thompson
God imagine if all these Oubre 3 bricks were Klay Thompson shots. What a tragedy.
Or Klay Thompson blacking out in Game 6.
"It's their defence. Steph isn't that bad of a defender but this narrative got started because in the playoffs he got targeted in every series, purely because he was on the floor with KD, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala and Klay Thompson."
Klay Thompson by far.
Middle Class Klay Thompson hittin them thangs
"I mean, Klay Thompson averaged only slightly more assists than that per game on slightly fewer shots for the pre-KD Warriors, and he clearly was the #2 option on those teams. Kawhi wasn't much higher in assist numbers when he was the #1 on the Spurs, either.   I agree he definitely needs to be paired with a good playmaker if you want to actually be a good team, and he probably at best ends up being a #2 unless he improves his distribution, but not being a distributor doesn't inherently cap a player at a secondary/tertiary option - they just have to have their other skills be comparatively better to make up for that."
My 2 cents: Steph Curry is turning into Klay Thompson in front of our eyes with how icy hot and streaky he is this season
Who needs Klay Thompson when you have Linsanity?
He became a Klay Thompson in the 4th and switched to Draymond in OT
Matthew Dellavedova Serge Ibaka Klay Thompson Christian Wood /s
"Klay Thompson on what he likes to watch in the NBA aside from the Warriors: ""I like watching Rick and Morty. The Rick is a lot of fun to watch. His creativeness, his inventions, his burping - it's a lot of fun to watch."""
"They're idiots.  Tony Bennet is one of best scouting coaches in CBB in terms of id'ing talent others overlook and he said Hunter had not even scratched the surface of his potential when he was drafted.  Reminder he recruited Klay Thompson, Joe Harris and Malcolm Brogdon."
Now I’m imagining ben simmons flanked by prime Steph curry and Klay Thompson. And FMVP Iguodala while we’re at it
I can atest to the Jae crowder turning into Klay Thompson 😭
Imma say Klay Thompson. Dude could score buckets in his sleep but I don’t think he’s ever averaged over 25 PPG.  Edit: I didn’t read the first option part. Imma change my answer to probably Magic then
"Yeah I much prefer him coming off screens Klay Thompson-style too, hopefully Donovan can run more sets using that Zach that way."
I think he could do most of this right now: https://mobile.twitter.com/NBATV/status/1082885393966686210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1082885393966686210%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2814797-watch-warriors-klay-thompson-drop-43-points-despite-taking-only-4-dribbles
"Jordan Poole like like he will be a legit scoring guard off the bench.   Warriors haven't started 10 players in five years either...  2015 was Looney with the 30th, he worked himself into a reliable rotation player.  2016 was Damian Jones, a raw, athletic center prone to fouling. Probably won't be in the league much longer.  2018 was Jacob Evans with the 28th pick, he never worked out.   2019 was Eric Paschall, someone who may not quite fit this roster but was a steal with the 41st pick and was all rookie first team.  That year was also when they selected Jordan Poole who looks like he will be a legit player. 28th pick.  Then of course 2020's #2, James Wiseman, who isn't very good but as a young, raw big man that's kind of expected. I believe he will be a great player.  They only had late 2nd round picks that year but Mannion already has given some ball handler minutes off the bench and Justinian Jessup is doing well in Australia.  It's rare to draft great players when you draft really low and expect for 2020 the Warriors have drafted really low. Despite that I think they've done well.  Also while Curry was a gift from the departing ownership/Larry Riley it was the new ownership and front office who drafted with better picks. Who did they select?  Klay Thompson with the 11th, Harrison Barnes with the 7th, Draymond Green with the 35th and Festus Ezeli with the 30th.  Stacked up against any other team during the last ten years I think the Warriors have drafted much better than average."
Steph curry on the detroit pistons u love to see it Klay thompson on the cavs too lmao
Heal Klay Thompson
I too am not willing to come off the bench for Klay Thompson.
"It actually is a discussion, hence why we are currently discussing it.  Like I said in the above comment that you conveniently ignored, Klay Thompson alone won’t make them a contender but Klay + whoever they get from a potential Wiseman/Minny pick trade package very likely will."
And all it took was for KD and Klay Thompson to get hurt.
Klay Thompson in: The Brave Little Toaster
"Not to forget one of the worst starting slumps from three, it was Klay Thompson level bad and it just got worse, then it got better and it got worse again. Having Wiggins and Oubre be so inconsistent on scoring is painful"
A super athletic version of Klay Thompson on offense. A bit of a downgrade defense only because he was pretty much carried so much weight offensively.
"Klay Thompson, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Draymond Green, Kyle Kuzma, Diana Taurasi, Nneka Ogwumike, Chiney Ogwumike"
Svi Mykhailiuk could become a more athletic Klay Thompson
"I mean didn't they win 2 championships after this quote though?  Plus they still have the best point guard in the league with Wiseman and some solid picks coming up, plus Klay Thompson coming back someday.  They're setup for a pretty quick rebound to contention right after one of the strongest dynasties in modern history just finished its run.  This quote just really doesn't hit THAT hard tbh."
"This khris needs to play off ball more, he turns the ball over way too much, if he could be like a klay Thompson catch and shoot guy wed be so good"
Danny Green broke Klay Thompson... Big sad.
Confirmed Klay Thompson to Brooklyn Nets.
"You say that like Beal is some seasoned playoff performer lol, MPJ has already played half as many playoff games as Beal has and has made it deeper too. He’s not Iggy or Ibaka. The drop from MPJ to old man Millsap isn’t even that much smaller than the drop from Beal to Barton. It just doesn’t improve the team enough *right now*, and MPJ by this time next year might well be better than Beal for what we need. MPJ is our Klay Thompson, we already have Murray to do what Beal does. Again he’s not Kawhi or Harden or anyone like that"
"Totally. This team’s offense is so fun rn. Jokic is point guard in a 7’0 frame, Porter plays like a 6’10 Klay Thompson, Murray is a 2 that plays the 1, Barton’s finally in his natural position after spending the past few years at the 3 and AG does a little bit of everything. I mostly say Porter is a 4 just because of defensive matchups."
"I'm beginning to suspect the Warriors aren't very good when they don't have Steph Curry, Draymond Green, or Klay Thompson available."
"&gt;No, it's way worse. The Warriors with KD playing are the greatest team of all time, the Warriors without KD are merely a superteam. The Raptors' number 1 and number 2 options playing injured is worse  No, it's not  &gt;Klay went out at the end of the 3rd in Game 6 after getting his ass kicked all but 1 quarter he played in what the fuck are you talking about you poor deluded soul  Klay literally got injured in Game 2, didn't play Game 3 and got rushed back which led to his easy ACL tear  &gt;and why don't we put in Ibaka's 2015 injury too while we're at it  An injury from a week before in the Finals or actually IN the Finals is the same as a Finals. Kawhi literally injured Looney himself in the Finals, you didn't even watch your own team's Finals games.

Klacy McThompson (Tracy McGrady and Klay Thompson blend)
He can just be our Klay Thompson on offense. Doesn’t need to be a creator at all
"&gt;Wiggins doesn’t look average though, he literally is scoring 18 on above average efficiency, and offense isn’t even his more elite area.  Being a little bit above average isn't exactly being elite  &gt;I appreciate the stats, but either way, I’d rather have Wiggins. Neither player is a good first option, but you can at least surround Wiggins with better players. If D’Lo is playing with other ball-handlers he loses a ton of value, and his shot-creation is significantly less valuable.  But you've never paired D'lo with good players before, you can't say how the fit will look with KAT and Finch has been saying he has a lot of plans for him. Especially late game since the Wolves have a creation problem where teams smother Towns and nobody else can get a bucket, D'lo's self creation is valuable.  &gt;It’s like comparing Klay Thompson and CJ McCollum. Except the defensive gap is even greater.  I mean you can't compare them at all offensively since like I said Wiggins has more than half of his shots assisted is a meh ball handler and meh passer."

"Steve Nash, Klay Thompson, Tim Duncan."
That may not be true. The 1987 Sonics went from 7th to conference finals.   Imagine if Golden State got back a full speed Klay Thompson near the playoffs and got back to 7th seed. You don't think they could make a run? It's all going to depend on relative strength and matchups.
"Kevin Durant has played one season of his NBA career without a future, present, or past MVP next to him. That was his rookie season. Since then he's either had Westbrook, Curry, or Harden on his team. When Westbrook was injured in 2013, the KD-led Thunder were up 2-0 on the Rockets in the first round of the playoffs and closed it out 4-2 before losing 1-4 to the Grizzlies the next round.  Title success in the NBA this past decade has been either you have LeBron James, ~~Klay Thompson~~ Steph Curry, or put Kawhi Leonard on a team that could make the conference finals without him."
"Offensively I just don't know dude moves off the ball like a 6'10 Klay Thompson sometimes but has on ball skills/shot creation skills that are a bit underused because he plays with an even better offensive player. So maybe a more consistent Paul George on offense.  Defensively I won't lie I haven't really focused on how he looks this year, will see in the playoffs how he holds up when teams start go at him like the Jazz did"
Steph Curry and Klay Thompson.
"He doesn’t even need to really, since Jokic/Murray/Gordon/+Barton, Monte and Campazzo are such good passers. He can just be our Klay Thompson and shoot over guys, he had 27 on four dribbles against the Sixers lol"
Klay Thompson looks like Squidward’s House
No. Defense like offense is a rhythm game. There’s players that take a good amount to get into their rhythm. Klay Thompson the last few seasons took a while to warm up from three. Are those 20ish games it took him to get in a rhythm discredit how good of a shooter he really is?
We really have our announcers talking about Terrence fucking Ross like he’s Klay Thompson
"Tbh Wiggins would be great as a 3rd option. If you replaced Kelly Oubre with a healthy Klay Thompson the spacing alone would completely transform the Warriors offense.  The other issues though are their bench depth, a reliable sixth man scorer, and growing pains with James Wiseman."
"Uncle Drew as the Ancient One and Kyrie irving as Dr. Strange.  IT as Bruce Banner and Zion as the Hulk. ""That's my secret, Captain. I'm always hungry.""  LeBron or Durant as Nick Fury recruiting everyone to team up with him. LeBron would look better than Durant with an eye patch.  Klay Thompson as Hawkeye cause he's a marksman who only shows up hot from time to time."
So Klay Thompson
"Have we already forgotten Bob Myers drafted Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, signed Steph Curry to a bargain contract allowing them to sign Kevin Durant and create maybe the best team the league has ever seen?  Not to mention found someone to take on the awful contract of Andris Biendrins in order to sign Andre Iguodala.  Not to mention managing to snag D'Lo when KD left and then flipping D'Lo for Wiggins and a pick?   Is he the best?  Idk.  But David Griffin makes your list and Bob Myers doesn't?"
There's nothing about defense that Klay Thompson does better than Paul George does. Just another part of the Klay Thompson mythology that he's some better defender than a guy like Paul George.  &gt;That means nothing to me in this scenario. I have those needs filled by other players.  Any worthwhile coach in the NBA will take a multifaceted offensive weapon who is easy to integrate over a catch and shoot weapon. Again none of this is controversial it just becomes controversial to say when one guy is a fan favorite and the other guy is Paul George.
This should be a good season for the two jays to grow as players. Right now they play like oldschool superstars (Kobe RIP). The superstars of the league are gifted playmakers shooters passers defenders. Cant just be about scoring anymore.  the two Jays could be elite defenders on level of Klay Thompson so start there. Also a major problem is the ball sticks in their hands to much. Even if they arnt getting assists they need to keep the ball moving in the flow of the offense.  &amp;#x200B;  Im expecting/hoping major improvements in those areas of the game next year
Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry and Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard and Dirk Nowitzki and JJ Barea and Jason Terry and Draymond Green and Klay Thompson and Boris Diaw and Tyson Chandler and Andre Iguodala and Tony Parker and Shaun Livingston and David West and many more all **OWN lemickey**
"Yeah, he’s more like Klay Thompson with the in between game than the likes of JJ Redick, Kyle Korver and Duncan Robinson"
on the offensive end he’s basically klay thompson with his offball movement and great catch-and-shoot ability off screens
"Yeah, I've referred to him as a PF Klay Thompson for awhile now. It's definitely the right comp. Especially if he can continue to get better defensively."
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green have shared the floor for 0 minutes this season"
The Klay Thompson special
I mean they gave him more post touches in 2017 and 2018 and he proceeded to get bodied up and blocked by Klay Thompson and DeRozan in the playoffs. He lost too much weight to be the scorer he was in Minny
"Mychal and Klay, Bill and Luke, Joe and Kobe, Dell and Steph, Rick and Brent...  I'm too young to have watched any of the fathers, but Mychal Thompson was the 1st overall pick in his draft. Was he a star?"
"Luka, Klay Thompson, Maxi Kleber, Joker, Bobi They win it all!"
Yeah it speaks to his overall value. And it's why someone like Paul George will be able to play till he's like 40 even when he cant really do anything with the ball in his hands anymore. One thing about Klay in general is he's also in a perfect ecosystem to maximize his strengths and camouflage his weaknesses. Not his fault although Orlando Magic Shooting Guard Klay Thompson would get talked about and viewed far far differently the past 10 yrs.   Tbh in the past I thought Ben's defensive reputation was a little overstated more very good than great. This year is the year where finally I think I've fully bought into his reputation defensively. But even then the DPOY talk is largely a byproduct of his uniqueness much more than him actually being the very best defender in the NBA.
"1)What surprised me the most was how raw James Wiseman is. Still has great potential.  2) Steph letting it fly and dropping multiple 50 pts games. I also love the defense when we are focused. Poutine Pippen has been pretty good. Looney has got to be one of the most mentally solid player I've seen around this year.  3) Our consistent inconsistency. Wiseman being raw. The injuries. The lack of focus and the poor spacing. Klay Thompson not playing. Paschall having a sophomore down year, and at times, Oubre. Finally, Wannamaker.  4) Hoping to finally see some wins with our schedule being easier.  5) Wiseman and Nico have been pretty alright. Both need to work. Waiting on Jessup who will play next year."
"Pos: Starter (Bench)  PG: Steph Curry (Tim Hardaway, Sleepy Floyd, Baron Davis)  SG: Klay Thompson (Mitch Richmond, Jason Richardson, Purvis Short)  SF: Kevin Durant (Chris Mullin, Paul Arizin)  PF: Rick Barry (Draymond Green)  C: Wilt Chamberlain (Nate Thurmond)"
Washington Wizards drafting Jan Vesely instead of Klay Thompson.
"&gt;but how does nuclear murray compare to nuclear Klay Thompson ?  As a Warriors fan and hardcore Murray stan, I feel like both can be demoralizing but I feel like each of their nuclear energy is a bit different. Although it can seem like they can get hot when their team needs them the most (see Klay Thompson's game 6 performance against OKC or against Houston, or Murray's game 2 performance against the Spurs, also think his game 3 performance against Portland is a good example of this too although the Nuggets lost that game thanks to CJ or his game 5 or 6 performances against the Jazz)  Klay's nuclear feels much more methodical like sometimes when Klay is hot he'll just stay that way for the entire game, also when Klay's hot it's because he's hitting a lot of three because he doesn't usually as much variety to his offense as Murray does, so if he starts to hit a few you can start to get the feeling that it's one of those games for Klay. I also feel like even when Klay's really hot he's still pretty emotionless like he doesn't do much showboating, he's like a stone-cold killer, I'd imagine it's different for opponents to watch him hot as opposed to Curry who has much more emotion and celebrates more when he's hot.  Jamal's nuclear comes in spurts and conveniently for the Nuggets seems to happen a lot in the second half/fourth quarter of games. When Jamal is hot, it just seems like he hits everything layups, mid-range, threes, Jamal makes any tough shot when he's hot the defense doesn't seem to matter (see 50 point game against Cleveland). Sometimes he stays hot for the whole game but it does seem like he likes stepping up in the fourth. A lot of the time the key for Murray to stay hot is him being aggressive when he's scoring well and playing aggressively he's super hard to stop like how he played in the bubble. Unlike Klay when Jamal's feeling good and going nuclear, you can tell because he's got a lot more emotion, trash-talking, you can just see the confidence in him rising and it feels like nothing rattles him. I've seen some comments in the Jazz and 76ers hating on Murray for getting hot and I feel like he's prone to get those comments more so than Klay when he's hot and playing with that kind of swagger in that way he reminds me of Steph and makes me think that it must feel different for opponents to play against nuclear Murray who has so much more emotion and swagger than Klay who just is emotionless even when he's hot"
"I haven't seen a game for a while, but how does nuclear murray compare to nuclear Klay Thompson ?"
"Every once in a while, I think ""Klay Thompson really put up 37 in a quarter!?"""
"Yes, but outside of the top 30 or so players in the league I think fit/defense/versatility/contract become more important than having 1 or two star qualities. Kind of like a Klay Thompson vs Zach Lavine situation, Zach is probably a better “best” player on a team, but 9/10 teams would take Klay to build their team with  Edit: Kings, Magic, Rockets, Wolves, Knicks, Spurs, maybe more maybe less"
"They got Kelly to replace Klay Thompson. Imagine if they had gotten Lamelo instead, they could be actually be competitive, and have a long term replacement lined up for when Klay/Steph age. Centers can be found anywhere and for really cheap. I’m personally just against using a top 3 pick for a C, especially for one as raw as Wiseman is. He hasn’t even been the best rookie C of the season.  Time will tell if they made the right choice however. But their choice has lead to them being non-competitive this season, vs being competitive had Lamelo been chosen."
You think it’ll take Klay Thompson a few YEARS to catch up to Kyle Lowrys 3’s?
One of my friends told me a story of Klay Thompson doing that. He was already in the NBA too. It was a small party or whatever and Klay just never missed.
Idk would you rather play with Davis and Lebron or Wiggins and Klay Thompson coming off a ACL tear and Torn achielles btb?
" KD: 35/8/5 on 70%TS  LeBron: 34/12/10 on 63%TS  LeBron did not have Klay Thompson and Steph Curry waiting for him in the corners. He also didn’t have a defensive anchor in Draymond green who is one of the best defenders of all time.  You’re saying KD did xyz, but LeBron if on that warriors team could do exactly that and more."
"I got two words for ya. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, Must See TV!"
"The Bulls really just lost to Draymond ""Klay 'Steph Curry' Thompson"" Green"
So I feel like you are making an artificial distinction between rebounding specialist and other players. No one who Is “just” good at rebounding can stay in the nba. kanter was a good scorer at the 4 and Thompson could play good switch d in that scheme.  So it’s really a matter of what else they can bring  to their one good skill just like Rubio had to learn to score and klay had to learn how to shoot layups
Klay Thompson
"&gt;Klay Thompson, Devin Booker and Steph with their baby faces.  Klay doesn't have a baby face. His face is thousands of years old, so old that scientists are still studying how and why it was created - and how it got to Bikini Bottom so Squidward could live in it."
Made me think of that Klay Thompson pic so here: https://i.imgur.com/O8uX8Cd.jpg
yeah this is a good analysis. Warriors had two shooters who you had to cover very closely off screens in thompson and curry. the nets really only have one of thoe guys in harris. Kyrie does come off screens but its not the same fervent defense youd need for klya or curry because he doesnt alwyas like to shoot that shot even tho he can. same thing with durant.   I think in terms of just pure iso/pnr tho the nets have it beat. The warriors in the pnr had green running the short roll. That let whoever was not on durant/thompson to help. when the nets run this you cant leave anyone because harris/kyrie/durant are the shooters. But the warriors were much beter when running klay/curry off screens.   nuggets are an interesting example you mention. Their core 4 of murray/barton/mpj/jokic are all great shooters. The murray/jokic pick and pop/roll is particularly difficult to defend with 2 defenders if murray is hitting the off the dribble 3. If gordon can sustain his shooting he'll be incredible. What nice about gordon is that since he can both handle the ball or play the roll man in a pnr. So if you use him as the screener than you can avoid the situation where people might ignore him on teh perimeter if his 3 isnt falling.
"So true. And the players getting the ""hot"" label are always white or lightskin. I mean sure if that's your type go off, but looked at some of these ""hottest nba players"" list bc I needed a comparison for Green and only 5 of 20 were dark skinned.   Instead they included guys like Gordon ""forgettable face"" Hayward, Danilo ""ass chin"" Gallinari or Klay Thompson, Devin Booker and Steph with their baby faces. Sure not ugly, but not really up there."
Klay Thompson?! Lol
I did read it I’m saying this post wasn’t needed. Whoever said it was an idiot so him posting it serves no purpose. Last week a homeless man said Klay Thompson is the best PG of all time. Am I going to post that too?
No one thinks Klay Thompson is better than Giannis. It’s context that matters. You can still use championships to compare great players in the right context but OP doesn’t get it.
"Ray Allen is pretty close to Klay Thompson offensively. More athleticism and ball skills for sure, but like 80% the same"
"Lol as if LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard wouldn't have also put up monster numbers. Each of those guys have had playoff runs putting up somewhat comparable numbers to Durant with the Warriors without the benefit of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green on the team. Those rings and Finals MVPs were the biggest jokes of all time."
"Maybe Klay Thompson? Klay isnt good off the dribble, but he has elite off ball movement, shooting and is usally guarding the best wing/guard.  I didnt watch too much Ray Allen, so im not sure."
PG: Chris Paul (Reserve: Stephen Curry)  SG: Kyrie Irving (Reserve: Klay Thompson)  SF: Kevin Durant (Reserve: Scottie Pippen)  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (Reserve: Kevin Garnett)  C: Nikola Jokic (Reserve: Hakeem Olajuwon)  Assistant Coach: Mike Dan Tony  Head Coach: Dick Carlisle
"The whole 2015 playoffs were a mess.   -Klay Thompson comes up small on offense in his first finals appearance. -Kyrie breaks his knee cap in game 1 of the finals.  -Clippers choke against the Rockets -Defending champ Spurs get eliminated on a Chris Paul game winner. -Noah and Gasol both get injured against the Cavs. -Cavs avoid going down 3-1 in the ECSF because the refs swallow their whistle when David Blatt calls a timeout he didn’t have.  -Kevin Love gets injured on a cheap shot from the Celtics in the first round.  -That Hawks team overachieves to the 1 seed and then gets smoked in the conference finals.  -Then the cherry on top, Steph Curry doesn’t win finals mvp despite checking all the boxes for finals mvp."
"It's actually Cle-ber,  it's not so much kla sound of ""clay"" as in Klay Thompson and more the cle sound of clever."
"I’m not saying that at all. I’m honestly baffled that’s the conclusion you came to. What I am saying is that his impact doesn’t fluctuate based on the quality of his teammates. Essentially judging players based on how well the team does doesn’t make sense since Luka on a worse team wouldn’t inherently make him a worse passer, even though the team’s *results* would vary from the one he’d hypothetically winning the chip with.  Let’s use your Luka example. Let’s say your hypothetical championship team around Luka includes Klay Thompson, OG Anunoby, Michael Porter Jr and Karl Anthony Towns. Luka balls out, plays excellent and leads the team to the best offence in the league.  Then, next season instead of those players Luka is surrounded by Terrence Ferguson, Alex Caruso, Derick Jones Jr and Steven Adams. That team is obviously going to end up having a far worse ORTG than the first team. Does that inherently make Luka a worse play maker? Or is he making the same passes, finding open teammates and they just aren’t hitting the shots that the first team was?"
"I'd say Bill Russell was clearly the most unselfish superstar ever.   Hell, Curry still led his team in Usage every year ..... even when Durant was there. Honestly, Klay Thompson is really the one who took a bigger backseat offensively to fit in KD."
Corey Kispert is 6’7” and is the third guy since ‘97 to shoot 50/40/90 in college (55/46/90 this year). His game is basically perfect for translating to the NBA. Could end up being somewhere between Joe Harris and Klay Thompson
"Trae is not better than Joe Harris lol, any more than he's better than Klay Thompson"
"There is, because you can't assume flip wouldve drafted wiggins if the wolves had the top pick in 2014.  I mention in another comment,  be was trying to get klay Thompson from the warriors, but eventually had to settle for Wiggins from Cleveland."
"I wouldnt say wiggins counts.  He was the best deal on the table for Kevin Love .  Flip wanted klay Thompson (which wouldve been the better move) but thankfully for warriors fans they didn't agree to that move.  Wiggins was not the wolves first choice really , just the best of that situation where Kevin love wanted out."
"Ok make any argument for Pippen then.   Shaq had better stats by a landslide, better MVP finishes, a scoring title, better team success as #1 option.  There is literally zero argument for Pippen over Shaq in the 90s.   17/6/6 is not better than 26/12/5.  You also taking Klay Thompson over Giannis and AD. Or do you only use this backwards logic for Pippen?"
No. There definitely isn't. Please go ahead and look at their stats and make an argument.  This is like saying Klay Thompson is a better player than Anthony Davis in the 2010s (pre Lakers).
"I fully agree with you as far as accent or tone goes, but if you are able to say 'Klay' Thompson you should also be able to say Klayber.  It is also so stupid that nobody is telling Kevin Harlan that the reigning 2 time MVP does not have a 'B' in his last name."
"Tatum: MVP &amp; 1st &amp; 2nd Team All-NBAs,  perennial All-Star   Brown: Keeps making All-Star, makes at least 1 All-NBA team  Marcus Smart: Continues making 1st Team All-Defense  Rob Williams: DPOY   Romeo Langford: 6MOY  Kemba: Hovers around pre-injury Kemba  Aaron Nesmith: Klay Thompson lite  Payton Pritchard: Better TJ McConnell  2 Championships. Break the tie with the Lakers. Beat the Lakers in the Finals"
Klay Thompson predicted the future.
He's good at randomly becoming Klay Thompson for 6 minutes once every 4 years.
"You know I'd like to see Lebron try to carry the 2017 warriors no way in hell is that team making the playoffs let alone winning it all. KD took these scrubs to the promise land: 2x mvp Steph Curry, 3 time all star Klay Thompson (who by the way hasn't even played in the nba since KD left), and fucking Draymond Green who cant really even shoot the ball, not to mention he had fucking Iguadola leading the bench."
http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/klay-thompson-of-the-golden-state-warriors-poses-for-a-portrait-with-picture-id477393980
"Durant is not and has never been in the same tier as LeBron in terms of impact relative to ultimate team success. Ultimate meaning a championship and not just regular season success. The floor was opened up for him in GSW allowing him to be the best statistical player, but anyone who watched knows Steph was the most valuable and whom the offense but built around. This isn't mentioning another 20 PPG scorer in Klay Thompson shooting 40 percent from 3 along with a versatile 1-5 DPOY who can play make better than most point guards. His first year in Brooklyn is seen by generational scorer James Harden carrying so far almost the entire regular season while he is sidelined and can walk back into one of the most complete teams in the league where the floor will again be completely open for him with sparse double teams.   Maybe this comes off as hateful, but I just view this as facts. KD is an MVP, generational talent and scorer while being a plus defender, but at no point has he been the most valuable on a team winning the championship and if the Nets win this season that will continue. And at no point has he been on a super team that could not replace him with an average league forward and still heavily compete for a championship."
"Ok but the other team also has Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond who had a 30 piece lol, so I’m sure they could’ve also found another bucket even after that too. Basketball is a game of momentum, and if you take it with 1:50 remaining in the 4th of Game 7 in the Finals, you’re in the drivers seat to win"
"I started getting interested in basketball about 2011.  I got a pirated copy of 2k11.  As a huge nephew that time, I was obsessed in 3 point shooting and sliders so I always beat up the Celtics with Steve ""GOD SERENA"" Blake  Since I like 3 point shooting, I followed closely to the GOAT shooter at that time who was Ray Allen. Wasn't really big on the Celtics or the Heat because I fucking hated LeBron so I settled with my second favorite thing in basketball which is flashy passing. Didn't help I was a huge weeb and liked Kuroko no Basuke so I was a Steve Nash/Ricky Rubio fan at that time.  About 2 years later, I discovered Steph Curry and realized ""Yeah I fuck with this dude"". That's how I invested a lot on Warriors stock. Really helped that his tag team duo was arguably the second best shooter of all time in Klay Thompson."
He plays with attitude and aggression.  I've been wanting to see Dame play alongside a Klay Thompson type guard and I think GTJ can be that guy
His ceiling is Klay Thompson I think. Can he create his own shot though? He might surpass him then. As thats one thing Klay isn’t great at.
"[Or Garnett screaming ""Anything is possible!""](https://youtu.be/1MkzF9cFs2I?t=106)  [Or Ron Artest giddy saying ""Kobe passed me the ball!""](https://youtu.be/YlY20xEgxY8?t=45)  [Or Lebron's ""This is for you Cleveland!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o_4fKmD6eo)  [Or Klay Thompson looking himself up on wikipedia after winning the title.](https://youtu.be/3352M1XmbPQ?t=108)  These moments are special and I'm never complaining as a fan that the athletes give us an opportunity to share in the crazy emotions they're going through when they win big games."
klay thompson...
"I feel like Draymond Green is Klay Thompson, compared to Pat Beverly. Thats how low he is on the totem pole"
"Jae ""Klay Thompson"" Crowder"

"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
If the Warriors traded Klay Thompson for peanuts when he was 23 years old and Steph was left with a roster that couldn’t compete he would very likely consider leaving as well. He’s had no reason to actually leave because the Warriors have been a very competent front office for basically his entire career. The idea that Steph’s loyalty is some unwavering thing that can never falter is fan fiction.
Warriors get:  * Kristaps Porzingis  Mavericks get:  * James Wiseman * 7th overall * 2022 1st * filler (Klay Thompson)  Fair trade imo.
"Curry won MVP in 2015 and 2016 and also went to the Finals in both of those seasons, winning the championship in 2015.  Durant won his first championship with the Warriors in 2017, the year after Curry won back-to-back MVP's and the Warriors went to the Finals back-to-back.  Durant may have been better than Curry in the seasons that they played together, but the Warriors were already a championship team without him, had a back-to-back MVP in his prime, a DPOY winner in Draymond, and one of the best shooters of all time in Klay Thompson, who also happened to be an All-NBA player.  There really isn't an argument for Durant as far as who had the better supporting cast. The Durant-Curry Warriors assembled more talent than probably any other team in NBA history. Having two MVP's in their prime play alongside each other is unheard of."
"As a Klay Thompson fan I feel your pain, Milwaukee. Really shitty luck. Sending big recovery vibes to Giannis"
"They missed the playoffs, but Warriors would have been an interesting playoff team had Klay Thompson not gotten hurt"
Hot take: Iso Joe &gt; Peak Klay Thompson
Warriors - Klay Thompson and Kelly Oubre.
Klay Thompson actually ran back out and shot FTs first. ACLs are weird
I don’t wanna hear anybody talk about klay Thompson
"Yep. Just for comparison's sake, [Klay Thompson tore his ACL on June 10, 2019](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201906100TOR.html) and [didn't get surgery on it until July 2nd](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1146171073358127104?s=19), some three weeks later. Klay didn't get clearance to return to full basketball activities after that for almost a full year, [not until June 21, 2020.](https://www.sportscasting.com/warriors-finally-get-the-news-they-wanted-about-klay-thompson/?amp)"
Possibly adrenaline. Klay Thompson had an ACL injury but was walking afterwards to shoot his free throws.
"If it were 90 percent of most NBA players I would be concerned, but because it is the greek freak think there is a good chance he can play game 6 after taking 1 game off. The injury looks bad in real-time, but because Giannis has longer legs he body is more resistant to tears compared to say a Klay Thompson."
Also Doesn't help that SG Klay Thompson hasn't played a Game in 2 Years.
"* 2020 - Jimmy, Bam, and Dragic get injured in the first half of the finals. * 2019 - Kevin Durant missed half the playoffs, tears his Achilles in the finals, and then Klay Thompson tears his ACL in the finals. * 2018 - Chris Paul gets injured in the Western Conference finals, swinging the series. * 2017 - Kawhi is blowing out the KD Warriors and then gets Zaza'd. * 2016 - Andrew Bogut breaks his leg in the finals and Draymond gets suspended for nut tapping LeBron. * 2015 - Kevin Love gets his arm snapped by Kelly Olynyk, Kyrie Irving's knee cap breaks in the first half of the finals, and the refs don't call a technical foul on David Blatt for calling a timeout with no timeouts left."
"They say Giannis walking on his own power was a good sign, but I remember Klay Thompson acting like he was about to come back in and jumping around when he tore his ACL, and that makes me super apprehensive"
Yo. Klay thompson walked and jogged with a blown ACL
"Game 1 went to OT and that's when Kyrie got hurt. Cavs literally had to rely on Delly to nearly kill himself to take that series to 6. It was LeBron, Delly and fucking Tristan Thompson against Steph, Klay and Draymond."
see: klay thompson shooting fts and walking off when he tore his acl
"Klay Thompson in the finals, tore it, then ran in the hallway and back on the court"
"Months before Giannis was drafted, a friend of mine showed me a few highlight clips, absolutely convinced that Giannis was going to be a superstar.  I wasn't convinced. He was so raw. I was excited and interested though, and watched him whenever I could after he joined the Bucks.  He quickly became a favorite, with how fast he developed his game, but more importantly, his awesome personality.  Seeing him so quickly become MVP and then MVP/DPOY was just insane.  I just hope this isn't a career altering injury. That was nasty looking. It was great to see him moving around and even coming back onto the bench, but I've seen Klay Thompson literally sprint down the corridor and then do full jumping knee raises on a busted acl.  Fuck these injuries this season. Trae and Giannis are two of a handful of my very favorite players in the league, and neither are playing, and Giannis looks to have suffered a potentially serious injury.  Fuck."
I think a close second  to 2019 solely because the warriors didn’t win and Klay Thompson hasn’t played since
"Witnessing that type of injury on Klay thompson, no doubt about it, it's an ACL tear"
"Yeah, scary. Reminds me of that Klay Thompson injury a few years back. He even checked back in the game only to feel the real pain and eventually finding out it's an ACL tear."
Of course he did. His knee is totally fucked.  Klay Thompson had a similar thing happen
Nope. Klay Thompson came back out for a free throw in the 2019 Finals after tearing his ACL
"that looked like a ACL tear to me, seen this with Klay thompson"
Not to be a Debbie downer but Klay Thompson *ran* back to the locker room
klay thompson walked when he tore his
"He can walk, but I've seen that same tear on Klay Thompson. Return is probably unlikely"
"If you'd told me after the 2016 Finals that Klay Thompson would co-star in a Lebron James Space Jam, I wouldn't believe it."
Bryn “basically Klay Thompson” Forbes
Jordan actually made the record for most 3's in a half in the 92 finals before Klay Thompson broke it lol. And he only did that to prove a point to people saying he couldn't shoot 3's. Hence the shoulders shrug game.
Klay Thompson is the most overrated player in the league  Gobert is not a top 5 defensive player or center  Fox is a better PG than young
"It's plausible that race factored into the selection. It's also plausible that it didn't. I have no way of knowing for sure.   But it's worth noting there were no white guys on the 2016 team (unless we're counting light-skinned, biracial Klay Thompson - I don't know how he identifies himself), or the 2004 team, so it's not like they have a consistent ""always put at least one Caucasian on the team"" rule like I keep hearing people claim they do."
"&gt; Or maybe, just maybe there is some bias/tokenism here.  It's at least plausible. I have no idea what was actually in anyone's heads. His selection is definitely surprising.  But it's worth noting there were no white guys on the 2016 team (unless we're counting light-skinned, biracial Klay Thompson - I don't know how he identifies himself), or the 2004 team, so it's not like they have a consistent ""always put a Caucasian on the team"" rule like I keep hearing people claim."
"Funny enough, Klay Thompson is known as an elite defender. And he is. His defensive +- stats has ALWAYS been negative. Analytics don't tell the whole story  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thompkl01.html"
Anyone who doesn’t believe in the hot hand has clearly never watched Klay Thompson play basketball
"If it weren’t for klay Thompson getting injured a few times - I’d say the warriors are perpetually in great shape from a roster standpoint.  They have a lot of good problems to have.  Curry, Thompson, Kelly oubre, draymond green and pascal siakam as a small ball center.  Watch out.  That team is gonna win a lot of games."
"Honestly, I support players. Being a diehard fan of a franchise can be rewarding when they are winning, but torturous otherwise. When I was a kid, I loved the Pistons because of Ben Wallace. I became a Warriors fan after Klay Thompson was drafted. Recently, I’ve become a big James Wiseman fan. I hope that he remains with the Warriors, but I doubt that he will based on how the front office talks about him. Wherever he goes, I will be a fan of that team too. Same goes for Steph and Klay."
"Uhhh hell no. Dinwiddie didn't even play and Joe Harris was doing nothing but being a brickhouse with his shots even when he was wide open. Nothing like Klay Thompson as some people were saying. If Kyrie wasn't injured, the series would have ended differently lol."
"Uhhh hell no. Dinwiddie didn't even play and Joe Harris was doing nothing but being a brickhouse with his shots even when he was wide open. Nothing like Klay Thompson as some people were saying. If Kyrie wasn't injured, the series would have ended differently lol."
"I’ve always thought his shoulder injuries is what’s made him a jumpshooter in LA rather than a dynamic driver like he used to.  Up until these past few games, hes looked so averse to driving into and absorbing contact since 2019. Even if he got the calls at the rim he looked frightened to absorb contact with those shoulders.   Especially last year in the playoffs he looked like he would be scared of driving into smaller guys; Seth Curry and Tim Hardaway scared him away from the rim.  That’s why he shoots inconsistently in the playoffs sometimes; because he plays too closely to 3&amp;D role players sometimes. He plays like a streakier 6’9” Klay Thompson. The 3 ball is an inherently more volatile scoring option, so that’s why things like the midrange are more valuable come playoff time.  Now he’s attacking more, playing in a drive &amp; kick system, is not afraid of contact, and is looking like PG again."
"so a team that made the play-in this year, plus Klay Thompson, plus PS, plus the #14 pick in this draft - isn't going to be a very good team?"
Did y’all really think Marcus Morris would continue to shoot like Klay Thompson for the entirety of this game
Marcus Morris picked a pretty opportune time to become Klay Thompson.
"Klay isn't an elite perimeter creator though, so teams sometimes just swarm Curry and slow down the Warriors' offense a bunch. The idea of stretching the defense so that swarming gets more difficult isn't bad.  Getting a perimeter or wing creator or someone with more gravity inside to free up Curry is a lot more difficult that hanging to a player hoping he'll play 3 and D.  Siakam has definitely shown more than Wiggins and he'll help a ton on defense too (provided Thompson returns to form they'll have a lineup of at least 3 excellent defenders).  But you've got to consider Siakam, Oubre and Dray all being bad shooters. Curry and Thompson can drain points but they'll have to work a lot more for it and in the playoffs it gets dicey. Same reason why Barnes's and Iggy's shooting slumps were a dread for the Warriors before going full Megazord with Durant."
"I think where ever he ends up will play a factor as well.  Imagine getting traded to Sacramento or Minnesota as back up to KAT, he'll most likely fall out of the league in less then 5 years.  He needs a team that can develop him .  If he ended in Toronto as per the rumored deal along with GSW's 7th pick and Klay Thompson, I can see him spending next season in the G-League playing heavy minutes to refine his game along with some of our other young talent."
"Honestly why is nobody mentioning Klay? Coming off back to back major injuries, I'd be very surprised if he comes back as half the player he was. To get siacam or even Lillard for him is so much more of an upgrade than having to get rid of Wiggins to salary match.  I'd go as far as to say that Wiggins is a more important player to this roster than Thompson will be"
Klay Thompson is third option to Steph and KD. That's it. In the entire league.   To think Klay &lt; Siakim on any end of the floor is forgetting who Klay Thompson is. I'm insulted by your comment and I'm not even Klay Thompson.
I mean the Warriors already have the highest paid salary in the league (granted that's with Oubre filling in on the Klay Thompson injury exception) but still. The Klay injury before the start of the 2020 season just threw everything for a loop.
"According to Malcolm gladwell he’s Nigerian, along with klay Thompson"
"He's way overrating Klay Thompson. Draymond is the Robin to Steph's batman, and Klay will be coming off more than 850 days without playing an NBA game and two devastating injuries."
"Yep I'm very proud of them, even now this series has felt winnable, until last night's 4th qtr. I still anticipate that they'll make it tough for Milwaukee, it's still 2-1, but I don't know if we can go the distance (although if any team can shock me in that department it's this one). After what Trae has shown this playoffs I truly think this exact team, if healthy, could have won the title this year, which is obviously a great position to be in going into the next couple of seasons.   That said I'd be happy to see the Bucks go to the finals if that's what happens, I love that team and love Giannis and Khris ""37 point quarter Klay Thompson"" Middleton."
"that’s why the KD Warriors are the best team in basketball period. Not only do you have arguably the greatest scorer of all time in Kevin “you know who I am” Durant, but you added him to the best regular season team of all time led by Stephen Curry whose offensive +/- the past 7 healthy seasons has been number 1 in the league.   Steph also has an argument for greatest scorer of all time and has the most influential gravity the game has ever seen, on par with shaq. We witnessed that this past season, and he led the league in points and ppg on league best efficiency on whatever minimum shot attempts (Kevin “you know who I am” Durant actually led it but he had too few games to be in contention).  Then you had Klay “Game 6“ Thompson, who can get BUCKETS with the best of em. No one is hotter than Klay Thompson when they get hot, he has the NBA records to prove that. 6’7’ SG who was at one time the best two way player in the entire league. The ultimate SG you’d want on a 5 man rotation. There are levels to catch and shoot. And he guarded the opposing team’s best perimeter player most nights.  This is rounded out by Draymond Green, the modern era’s best defender period.  We took for granted that it wasn’t just all stars joining forces, it was literally two Top 15 players of ALL TIME, and 2 (3 if you think Iguodala gets in) other Hall of Famers. Yeah, watching what Steph and KD did individually this past season was spectacular to watch as a fan. Here’s hoping that Klay, too, makes us remember how fucking badass he is. The game will feel robbed if he doesn’t"
"I’ve never seen an article talking about how Siakam and FanVleet were All-Defensive snubs. And did you watch the Jazz series. It wasn’t Goeberts fault that the wings couldn’t guard a nose bleed so he was forced to defend the paint and perimeter. The Jazz’s defensive scheme was exposed. Klay Thompson is a 6’6 guard, he is a very good defensive player considering everyone he guards is usually smaller. And again you continue to show you don’t know what you’re talking about. Kobe’s last All-NBA defensive appearance was in 2012…"
"Fan vote is for the starters. The coaches and media aren't picking him for reserves either. I've never seen an article talking about how CJ McCollum was an all star snub.   You're correct , it is my opinion at the end of the day. Do you really think late career Kobe was a top 10 defender when he's making those teams?  I really don't think Marcus Smart , Klay Thompson, and Eric Bledsoe are top 10 defenders either. As well, you're discounting that all defence is a regular season award. That raptors team was built for the highest levels of playoff defence which is almost a completely different game. E.g. DPOY Gobert is not holding up in that series."
"Shawn Marion and Draymond were never top 3 salaries for a championship team.  Klay Thompson/ Steph Curry were also getting ripped off for most of GS’s championship run, so I don’t think he is even a good example.          Draymond has shown the last two years he can’t be your best or 2nd best player, and Ayton is going to be getting significantly more (cap % wise) than he ever did."
"Lmao you dense... you been watching, or you new to the NBA?    Nets lost Kyrie and Harden, Lakers lost AD, Clippers lost Kawhi, and Warriors were missing Klay Thompson this year. Those are the 4 best teams.   5th best is debatable but Mavericks lost to a full strength Clippers team, Jazz were missing Conley, and Nuggets lost Murray awhile back. Those teams are on the level of the Bucks and Suns."
Idk when KD tore his Achilles and klay Thompson tore his ACL in back to back playoff games I thought that was pretty bad too
Middleton looking like klay Thompson out there
Klay Thompson a superstar? Lol. Even Kyrie isn't a superstar. That term is reserved for like the top ~5-10 players in the league.
I’m not a LeBron fan but no Klay Thompson after a torn ACL and Achilles does not in fact turn a team who missed the playoffs into a contender
"If Dell Curry didn't exist, Klay Thompson would be the greatest shooter of all time, Sixers would have been swept by the Hawks. Damion Lee wouldn't have a wife, and Austin Rivers would be the best active basketball player in his family."
"Yep. Just for comparison's sake, [Klay Thompson tore his ACL on June 10, 2019](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201906100TOR.html) and [didn't get surgery on it until July 2nd](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1146171073358127104?s=19), some three weeks later.

"It's not totally unusual to wait a couple weeks for the swelling to go down before getting surgery to repair an ACL injury.

"&gt;the entire point of the grading system is to distinguish between the grades of injury because they have entirely different outcomes and treatment protocols.   That's a fair point, but AFAIK the Clippers still haven't provided the results of his MRI or told us the grade/severity of his injury. We've been going under the assumption that he's day to day so it must not be that bad, but that could just be gamesmanship by the Clippers to keep the Suns off balance by thinking he might come back any game. Which he might, I don't know. But we shouldn't just assume it's so minor it'll heal on its own.   As for it healing on its own, [this doctor](https://youtu.be/d2iDnKPyxvw?t=3m39s) said that even with minor ACL injuries most times they do surgery just because if the ligament heals in a stretched out or elongated position it can destabilize the knee. And while this is OK for average people, it's not good for professional athletes who continually put stress on their knees. We are not out of the woods yet with this. [Klay Thompson tore his ACL on June 10, 2019](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201906100TOR.html) and [didn't get surgery on it until July 2nd](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1146171073358127104?s=19), some three weeks later.

Until they say he's either been cleared to resume full basketball activities or that he's getting surgery we shouldn't jump to any conclusions."
I don’t watch Minny basketball because I believe KAT &gt; Ayton is a popular opinion? Lol ok  I know how good KAT is. He’s probably the best shooting centre of all time and has without exaggeration put up Klay Thompson shooting numbers for large stretches.
"Is Klay Thompson, was Chris Bosh?"
"1 wiseman was a rookie last year who played 3 games as a freshman in Memphis before his season ended.  2 IMO, Bigs like wiseman don’t fit well in what GS likes to do offensively. So judging him off of those factors are premature to say he’s not going to end up as a good NBA player  3 What do Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Giannis, Julius Randle, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Damontas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Donovan Mitchell, Collin Sexton and MPJ all have in common?  Don’t act like later round lottery draft picks don’t turn into all-star caliber, even MVP caliber nba players"
"If they play great defense and score those 20 points very efficiently, then they absolutely can be. Klay Thompson was averaging around 20-22 ppg before injury, and he was absolutely worth a max because of how his game elevated the rest of the team. It’s all about context"
Richard Jefferson on Klay Thompson

"I guess they’re saying Lebron is more of a risk taker when it comes to passing. He is better at making the hardest passes but is not as efficient making the routine passes. Perhaps like Lillard and Klay at shooting, Dame is better at lower efficiency off the dribble long range 3s, while klay thompson could probably be a top 2 catch and shoot shooter,but doesn’t attempt many flamboyant long range shots."
"It has a chance, but right now it’s gotta be 2011. Kawhi, Kyrie, Butler, Klay, Kemba, Bogdanovic, Vucevik, Reggie Jackson, Tristan Thompson, etc."
2019 NBA champions: Toronto Raptors* Asterisk reason: Kevin Durant ruptured his Achilles tendon in Game 5 and Klay Thompson tore his ACL in Game 6. Kawhi Leonard rested all season and a timely gust of wind at the end of Game 7 against Philadelphia 76ers nudged the ball just enough to fall in the basket. Unfair.
Reggie jackson turned into fucking......shit klay Thompson he hitting all 3s lmao
"I think Draymond could be at least a decent 3pt shooter. He is shooting a career 31.6% from 3pt and had a seasons in which he shot 33.3, 33.7, and 38.8 respectively. He also happens to be around literally 3 of the greatest 3pt shooters of all time in Steve Kerr, Steph Curry, and Klay Thompson. Draymond doesn't have to be a great 3pt shooter either, he just has to be able to hit wide open looks so defenders can't sag completely off him at the perimeter."
"Klay Thompson NBA Finals.. dude was on for a 60 piece mcnugget, was about to beat them on his own smfh"

"Unless Golden State gives up Klay Thompson or has a third team to join, I don't see how it's possible."
Klay Thompson
"In the same sense that Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are role players, sure."
"yeah never seen him with hair, he seems whiter than klay thompson in general"
"Klay Thompson and Luka are incredibly skilled and are not in the league entirely because of their height. They would still be in the league if they were shorter, like you said. Embiid and Jokic would not be able to do anything at 6'8"
"Would be pretty cool to see Simmons bring up the ball as another ball handler to see the floor act as the point guard once in a while and then have Curry and Klay run off ball screens to get wide open shots and then Simmons could drive into the paint and as the defense collapses on him so he doesn’t score he could kick it out to an open Klay or Curry, and if they don’t collapse on him he can take it to the rim and score, and what other better way to work on your shot other then being on the same team and learning from the greatest shooter of all time Steph Curry every day, AND Klay Thompson ! I feel like it would be a great fit"

"Would be interesting to see Simmons with curry And Klay, put him at the 3 let curry and klay play off ball let Simmons gather the attention by driving in the paint then kicking out to an open curry or Thompson, could be lit lowkey"
"I mean no shit. You wouldn't even need to take anywhere close to that much height off. Even being a few inches shorter would put a lot of NBA players out of the league.   But you could say that about any player not just bigs. You take a 6'8"" 3-and-D wing and make him 6'4"" and he becomes a mediocre guard. You take a 6'2"" PG and make him 5'10"" and you have a G-leaguer.  Sure a 6'8"" Embiid or Jokic wouldn't be too impressive, but Klay Thompson at 6'2"" is a slower JJ Redick. Luka Doncic at 6' 3"" is a slower Jose Calderon. Trae Young at 5'9"" would never get his shot off."
"Has nothing to do with this post but Klay Thompson has such an aesthetic free throw routine. Quick, efficient, accurate, repeatable. Miss him."
"Some players work better as sidekicks.   Example. D Wade is a better player than Klay Thompson, if you need to build a franchise you’d go with Wade. But if you already have your franchise player, Klay is probably the better sidekick, his skill set makes him a perfect #2.    Idk where Pippen would rank tho. He was amazing without MJ but it’s hard to say how high he’d be"
Booker’s obvious weakness on offense is iso ball beyond the three. Booker excels at getting the ball in movement like Klay Thompson. His weakness is huge in the playoffs bc he can’t reliably run the offense in crunch time.
"&gt;Mortgaging our future for 2 years of a maybe above average center would be beyond dumb.   Christian Wood is a well above average centre. I don’t believe you’ve watched him very much.  Either way, with that mindset you’re resigning yourself to being okay with not winning anything for the remainder of Steph’s prime. You may be okay with that as a fan but I’d be very surprised if the front office shared your sentiment.   &gt;Wood is not putting us over the hump.   But that’s just it, you aren’t even anywhere near the hump. You were the 8 seed this year. You guys aren’t close to contention relatively speaking. You need all the help you can get.   &gt;Klay coming back and looking at least 70% of what he used to is what puts us back into contention.   I really don’t think it does. Even a 100% Klay Thompson isn’t enough to turn an 8 seed into a contender, let alone a Klay Thompson coming off both an ACL tear *and* an Achilles tear.  It seems you’re falling into the trap of both heavily overrating your young player and being overly optimistic about the level of your player returning from injury. I’m not trying to be a dick at all but believing you’re a contender next year with just Klay coming back and small moves here and there is a downright fantasy."
"...we supposed to pretend like nothing world shaking has happened since **2016** in regards to racists becoming emboldened in America?   &gt; Who was the token white guy in 2016, klay Thompson? 🤣🤣  Lmao I'm done you're absolutely ridiculous trying to explain this away when you can't and unable to read even the simplest statement that I don't actually think this is the reason"
"I mean, even with Beal out, we still have three ultra ball dominant guys in KD, Tatum, and Dame. Unless Booker is going to become Klay Thompson overnight, he solves none of our problems."
So like a klay Thompson or Michael redd. I’d give max contract. Scoring is the most important aspect of the game. 30 on elite efficiency is definitely worth it
"He played with LeBron and Kobe in 2008, LeBron and Durant in 2012, and Durant, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, and Paul George in 2016.   But sure, let's give Carmelo all the credit! He's the greatest Olympic Basketballer!"
Reggie averaged like 7 FTA per game while playing like Klay Thompson (who averages like 3-4). Dude was flopping like hell.

The most basketball we’ve seen from Klay Thompson this year is from Space Jam.
Jae Crowder is impersonating Klay Thompson because Klay has been hurt and he didn't want to be in a league without Klay
"The 2021 warriors have a bad supporting cast and no klay Thompson. The 2016 warriors had a great supporting cast and klay Thompson.  The warriors supporting cast was elite, that’s undeniable. But they weren’t an OP team, every champion team has either had more/the same top level talent than the warriors (in terms of # of guys) or incredible supporting casts too.  2011 Mavs: 1 superstar, amazing supporting cast comparable to the warriors 2014 spurs: incredible supporting cast, debatable on superstars at that point in their careers but def stars 2019 raps: 1 superstar, amazing supporting cast.   These are 3 examples in the past 10 years of teams having amazing supporting casts. That’s what a great team is built like when they don’t have multiple all nba players. The 2015-16 warriors were that OP because steph curry is just that elite. Any organization that could have put the right pieces around him in his prime would have made a contender."
Crowder or Klay Thompson?
No person in their right mind will draw any parallels between Klay Thompson and Shaq. Stop it.
"I’ve always said it and I’ll say it again, Klay Thompson is the better 3 point shooter. Curry is obviously the most ridiculous and influential 3 point shooter ever, but Klay’s buttery form, ability to pull up from anywhere at any point in front of any defense, and the fact that he doesn’t have other insane abilities (curry’s handles, creation and such) that defenders have to worry about, make him the better 3 point sniper."
"Unguarded, like in practice?  Steph has done like 115 or something. I don't know what Klay's record is but it probably ended at ""he was getting bored"".  I know when people did a thing of having Klay Thompson shooting in total darkness he went 8/10."
"I said years ago Klay Thompson on fire is more nuclear than anyone else in the league, he doesn’t get hot he goes nuclear and no one not Durant not Steph not harden can shoot better when he’s hot and to top it off he can be a spectacular defender as well   It’s not that those guys or Lebron aren’t scary when they get hot I just feel like like Klay can’t miss from anywhere on the floor when he gets going it’s not even about spots he’ll kill you in all ranges and then chase down your best player"
"Klay is slightly more flammable. Steph has the better handle, which allows him to be a bit more creative. But. I don't know that I'd bet against Thompson even if Steph is involved."
"Jenny: ""On an interview yesterday, Klay Thompson said LeBron can't beat Bugs Bunny in basketball. Shannon, what do you make of it?""  Shannon: ""Skip, I disagree with Klay here. LeBron is 6'8 250 lbs and Bugs Bunny is a rabbit, you really think that a rabbit can beat a fully grown man? Stop it, Skip.""  Skip: ""My turn!!! I was there when Bugs Bunny teamed up with Jordan to beat The Monstars. You better believe that Bugs can beat LeBron. Even though he's smaller than LeBron, but he can jump out of the gym. And most importantly he can shoot FTs, unlike your man LeBron James."""
"You have to understand that ""cleared to resume on court activities"" does not mean ""playing in your first game.""

As this doctor explained literally the day after the injury occurred, [even mild ACL sprains usually require full surgery to repair.](https://youtu.be/d2iDnKPyxvw?t=3m39s) The reason is because if the ACL heals in a stretched out or elongated position it can lead to further instability.

In a perfect world we would have our best players representing team USA.  C Anthony Davis  F LeBron James  F Kevin Durant  G Klay Thompson  G Steph Curry    Perfectly balanced lineup that would be unstoppable.
Klay “Data Driven” Thompson
You forgot Game 6 Klay Thompson
"Unfortunately for the Bahamanians, Klay played for Team USA in the 2016 Olympics in Rio, which should render him ineligible to represent any other nation. There are some exceptions in the FIBA bylaws that could be pursued, the one that seems most likely to apply would be:  &gt; ...in exceptional circumstances the Secretary General may authorise such a player [who has represented another nation at the senior level after his 17th birthday] to play for the national team of his country of origin if he is ineligible to play for such country according to this article 3-23 and if this is in the interest of the development of basketball in this country.  I could see the argument that adding a player like Klay to their National Team roster could contribute to the development of basketball in The Bahamas. Having said that, it's not actually Klay's ""country of origin."" Mychal Thompson is the one from The Bahamas. Klay was born in LA and grew up back and forth between there and Oregon. So it's kind of a stretch.  But the Bahamas could still field a roster with Buddy Hield, Deandre Ayton, and some of the lesser Thompsons."
"Really bad roster building. Team USA miss another bigman to sub in to Bam in case of faul trouble and/or injury. They miss shooters, they have scorer but not a Klay Thompson kind of guy (who was present in 2016, but also Melo played that role the whole time).  Team USA had the same mentality of 1992, of just brig in the best they can have and they should win, but the World is catching up, they lost two against good team but not even medal threatening teams like Spain or France (which had beaten Team USA in the World cup)."
"Too many ball-dominant,  ISO guys.   Someone like Klay Thompson would have been perfect for this team if he was healthy. Mostly moves without the ball and plays defense."
&gt;  everyone on this sub has completely forgotten Klay Thompson was the best player on that team before he got injured  ???????????? steph??????????
Giannis is basically Klay Thompson from 3 compared to Ben Simmons lol
Klay Thompson  2019-2020  2020-2021
"Klay is one of the best perimeter defenders in the last 10 years. Also never forget he holds the NBA record for 37 points in a quarter. A quick rundown of his records was recently published on NBA.com, “14 made 3-pointers. 60 points in less than 30 minutes. 10 straight 3s. 37 points in a single quarter. You can't tell the story of Klay Thompson without these historic performances.” Dude is a beast and anyone who says otherwise is pulling some Skip Bayless bullshit."
"No. He's an incredible shooter who can get wherever he needs to be on offense, doesn't need the ball in his hands, and is an elite perimeter defender. You pointed out that when Steph sits (thus making him obviously the best shooter on the floor for his team) he averages 38% from three. For reference (no disrespect) Dame Lillard is a career 37.5% 3point shooter and Harden has topped 38 once in his career (in OKC). He definitely doesn't have the ego of a max player, but if we ever decided he wasn't worth the max, teams would line up willing to pay and no one would blame them, would you if your team somehow ended up in the Klay Thompson sweepstakes? I'd be so upset to see him go, but honestly a little curious to see what he could do with his own team."
"&gt;  The Warriors frequently closed games with Steph Curry/Jarrett Jack/Klay Thompson/Carl Landry/David Lee lineups.  Oh man I remember Jarrett Jack playing some great playoff basketball during this time. He made so many tough buckets, it looked like he couldn't miss at times with some very clutch and timely buckets sprinkled in as well. He looked like a real leader out there. I loved the Nuggets that year because I loved the Gallinari/Iguodala combo and vividly remember Jack closing out games."
"Fair, there's a lot of faux earnest troll posts here that come up so I was unnecessarily snappy.  To give some more context, Jackson actually did a good job in 2012-13. But in retrospect, it's clear some of the things he did very well were not necessarily intentional. If anything, I'm actually more critical of Jackson's coaching job that season than I used to be.  On the second game of the year, Brandon Rush tore his ACL. Rush's career never recovered. But before that point, he was a very solid 3+D wing who figured to peak as a Danny Green type. Harrison Barnes was already slotted in as the starting SF, but he then got thrust in 25-30 minutes a game. Andrew Bogut, who was acquired the season before while he was recovering from an ankle surgery, played the first games of the season, and then didn't play again until February or so.  So only 5 games into the season, the Warriors' were down two of their top 6-7 players. Under those circumstances, Jackson was forced to make adjustments and he actually made some really smart ones. Draymond Green got rotation minutes as a rookie, even though he was an even more horrific shooter than he is now. He was very useful even though he shot badly AND he was playing the 3 with Richard Jefferson at the 2 (mind you, RJeff killed the Warriors in the playoffs 3 years later at the 4). The Warriors frequently closed games with Steph Curry/Jarrett Jack/Klay Thompson/Carl Landry/David Lee lineups. Back in 2012-13, those teams had more spacing than other NBA teams and Lee's defensive shortcomings were masked with him at the 5. The Warriors surprised a lot of teams that year and Steph Curry really turned it up to end the season after being snubbed for what should have been his first All-Start appearance.  In the first game of the 2013 playoffs, David Lee tore his hamstring off the bone. The next game, Jackson went small with Barnes at the 4 and Jarrett Jack at the 2 and the Warriors quickly took control of the series. Steph had spacing around him and with Bogut setting screens, he tore apart the Nuggets and upset them as the sixth seed.  The Warriors then faced the Spurs, who they hadn't beat in San Antonio in nearly 15 years. The Warriors came within a possession of taking game 1 in overtime and Steph Curry had 42 points. There was a defensive breakdown at the end of the game that fucked things up, but it was clear the Warriors were not a fluke. They beat the Spurs decisively in game 2 when Klay Thompson got very hot. It looked like the Warriors might actually win that series, but Steph hurt his ankle and played decoy in the final two games of the series, and Bogut also reinjured his ankle and was very limited in the end of the series.   But in the final games of the series, Greg Popovich figured outsmarted Jackson in a way that later seemed prophetic. He put Tony Parker on Harrison Barnes and because the Warriors had a perceived mismatch, they fed Barnes in the post over and over again and Barnes had high volume scoring performances in the final games of that series. But the problem with a Barnes-centric offense is that it takes the ball out of the hands of Steph Curry and Klay Thompson. The Spurs won the math battle in those final games of the series and Popovic figured out a very exploitable flaw in Jackson's philosophy, which is that Jackson will attack ""mismatches"" whenever he sees them."
He absolutely is not. Its unbelievable how everyone on this sub has completely forgotten Klay Thompson was the best player on that team before he got injured
"If you have to ask, you weren't watching those Warriors teams.  Jackson had the Warriors passing less than almost any team in the NBA. Opposing teams could goad Jackson into calling ISO post-ups for pretty much any player on the roster so long as the other team put a smaller defender on a Warrior player. Jermaine O'Neal, Klay Thompson, and Harrison Barnes post-ups were a fundamental part of the 2013-14 Warriors' offense. Harrison Barnes played shooting guard in many bench lineups that year. Draymond Green was a 3 for much of the season, until Jackson finally started using him in closing lineups at the 4 next to Andrew Bogut. The Jermaine O'Neal/Mo Speights frontcourt was a thing. Kent Bazemore played the back-up point guard role. It was an absolute mess."
"Breakout: Nicolas Claxton, Cam Reddish, Darius Garland(if they trade Sexton)  Fall off: Julius Randle, Lebron(injuries and old age are piling on him) and Klay Thompson(if his injuries zap his full star power)"
"This is a complicated question with a complicated answer - eye test consensus paints klay thompson as a top 15-20 player in his prime.  Advanced metrics (BPM, on/off, RTG) paint him as a top 40-50 player.  This discrepancy exists for a complicated reason.  Klay Thompson's strengths: -Shooting (all time 3 point shooter) / spacing -On ball defense  Klay Thompson's weaknesses: -Playmaking -Help Defense (sometimes not his role, but nonetheless rarely breaks up plays)  In 2016,   the best shooter was Curry, who could increase his usage when Klay was off the floor. the best playmaker was Draymond, who is almost always on the floor with Steph in lineups for the past half decade. the best on-ball defender and transition player was Iguodala, who was better than Thompson when playing with the other 4 starters.  So what happened?  Klay Thompson benefits from playmaking, except Draymond is always playing with Steph.  Klay Thompson is an excellent 3 point shooter, but Curry just increases his volume when Klay is out.  Klay Thompson is a strong wing defender, but Iguodala was an on-ball juggernaut who was better in transition, creating more positive value when he was on the floor over Thompson.  So what was the logical decision for coaching?  Play Thompson in the second unit.  Unfortunately for him, his motion heavy style of play in the golden state system without strong ancillary ball handlers led to highly contested shots from 3, and plays were run to get him open on long 2s that were not run for Steph, which lowered his efficiency further.  This made him look very pedestrian on golden state's second unit, and it was partially a coaching and front office problem.  So, in summary, on a team with Lebron James, who plays like a GOAT version of Andre Iguodala, I think he would be more valuable.  But ultimately I think playing with Steph makes him somewhat redundant and less valuable than the eye test would suggest."
"Combine that with elite level defense, that’s Klay Thompson but maybe better"
honestly? The San Fran curse will continue and Klay Thompson will get lost to the sea while on his boat. He will take over as the next Davey Jones and guide lost souls to their watery home.
I don't understand why you'd trade Wiggins for salary filler when the corpse of Klay Thompson is available for 30 million per year
They’d have to trade klay Thompson. Not going to happen
True but he’s also elite at defense. More comparable would be who is more valuable Klay Thompson or Ben Simmons.   Or maybe Ricky Rubio vs Duncan Robinson.
Darius Garland will break out and Klay Thompson might not be considered a fall off but I think the injuries are really gonna affect him
"Here's a fact about Klay Thompson that pretty much sums up his impact as a player:  Of the all-time top-50 players in 3pt% (coincidentally, everyone above 40%), only three players have made an All-Defensive team: Raja Bell, Danny Green, and Klay Thompson. Here are their stats:  • Raja Bell: 10ppg, 40.6% from deep  • Danny Green: 9 ppg, 40.1% from deep  • Klay Thompson: **19.5** ppg, **41.9%** from deep"
"He got 2nd team all-NBA defense in 2019. I've watched most of his prime. He's a very good defender. Probably hasn't gotten enough credit for that in terms of attention/accolades. When people hear the name Klay Thompson, they immediately think of his shooting. There's a whole other dimension to his game. Being an off-ball player on offense allows him to conserve most of his energy for defense, where he's often tasked with guarding the other team's #1 option.   I don't know if all fans really understand how unique it is to have a player who's possibly the all-time great catch-and-shoot threat in league history AND good enough defensively to handle the other team's #1 option. Usually these shooters are specialists like Korver, Kerr, and Reddick who present liabilities on the other end. With Klay you are getting a 2-for-1 type of value: elite spot shooting and elite defense.  That's part of why this dude has won so many basketball games. If you actually want to win games, you want Klay Thompson in your lineup.   However, iso 1v1 scoring is the only way some people understand basketball, so *he couldn't lead a team as the #1 option* becomes the lens through which they evaluate players. That's a really limited understanding of team basketball. Larry Hughes and Ricky Davis would be better as a #1 option than Dennis Rodman or Ben Wallace. Who won championships? Who is in the Hall of Fame? This game is not all about 1v1 scoring with the ball in your hands."
You really threw Klay Thompson in there? Klay has never been close to a top 10 player and D Wade was top 10 for like 7 years
"&gt; Klay is the ultimate #2 option  No he isn't lmao. You'd ideally want your second option to be a high level self-creator or passer as well. Thompson is neither of those. He's a highly dependent offensive player. Also, ""lockdown defender"" is hilarious."
"There aren’t going to be better offers than an overpaid role player, a project, and a bunch of late firsts huh?  Well, I should know to just listen to GSW fans on this type of thing, they also told me that Kelly Oubre was going to do a great job filling in for Klay Thompson."
"Be as good as he was? Definitely a gamble. ""Be able to still play in the NBA"" is not that big of a gamble lol it's Klay Thompson, even as a spot up shooter with bad mobility he could still be incredibly valuable on offense. I think a trade for Dame would be, in part, injury insurance on Klay as well"
Breakout: John Collins  Fall off: Klay Thompson
Los Angeles Lakers: Damian Lillard/Bradley Beal/LeBron James/Anthony Davis/Nikola Jokic  LA Clippers: Trae Young/Paul George/Kawhi Leonard/Zion Williamson/Joel Embiid  New York Knicks: Luka Dončić/Devin Booker/Jimmy Butler/Julius Randle/Karl-Anthony Towns  Brooklyn Nets: James Harden/Kyrie Irving/Kevin Durant/Giannis Antetokumpo/Rudy Gobert  Golden State Warriors: Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson/Jayson Tatum/Draymond Green/Deandre Ayton
"I think there’s better offers than what the Warriors could give unless Klay Thompson is involved.   OKC could give them Shai and all the picks  Denver could give something involving Jamal Murray  Pelicans could probably try something like Bledsoe and Ingram for Dame  Knicks have Barrett, Quickley, Toppin, Knox they could use in a possible deal  Nets could always offer a Kyrie swap  If the Heat believes in Precious, they could always move Bam"

"&gt;That ""injured team"" is regarded by the community as the core reason Kawhi is in the ""top 5"" category.   That isn’t true whatsoever. He was universally regarded as a top 5 player before he ever put in a Raptors jersey. You either started watching basketball that year or you’re practicing revisionist history. Go make a post asking if Kawhi was considered top 5 on the Spurs and the overwhelming majority of people will say yes.  &gt;Whether it's fair or not, people talk about the finals FAR, FAR, FAR more than the rest of the run.   No they don’t, wtf? The 76ers and Bucks series are widely regarded as his playoff masterpiece and what enforced that top 5 status.   &gt;People talk about Kawhi being a 2x Champion and 2x FVMP, not a Champion and FMVP and ECF Champion, y'know?  Lmao…you’re making this into a weirdo Warriors fan thing as opposed to an actual discussion about Kawhi  &gt;Yes, Steph was still on the Warriors team, but you guys literally used a high school defensive tactic JUST to stop Curry and Curry alone because his supporting cast couldn't punish it.  To say it was just to stop Curry *alone* is something Warriors fans have convinced themselves and not at all reflective of reality.  The actual answer is that Klay Thompson played the vast majority of that series putting up 26 ppg on **70.6 TS%**. Yes, he got injured but **he played far more often than he didn’t** and to say Curry was alone *the entire time* is factually untrue.   By the way, you lost 11 out of 14 quarters with Klay in the game.  Also, Kawhi was hobbled on one leg and not even remotely 100%   Also, we were missing our best wing defender for 100% of the series. Pretty sure OG missing 6 games balances out Klay missing 1.5  &gt;Also, who were the 2 all stars?  Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.  &gt;Bucks were just as injured in the ECF as the Hawks were, as they were missing Donte.  This comment is way too stupid to warrant a serious response."
"Aren't those just normal finals shooting percentages?  This isn't the regular season, teams are massively scheming defensively.  Middleton isn't getting shit (from what I have seen) for his poor shooting, it's for his lack of play. The first 2 games by him, it was like he wasn't even on the court most of the time. Hardly shooting, hardly play-making, hardly ball handling.  As opposed to Book, who was ball dominant, play making, and putting up points on a winning team. Yeah he shot 45% across those 2 games, but I'd expect a drop in shooting when an excellent team like the Bucks is trying their heart out to stop you.  Like for example, in the finals in 2016:  2016 Unanimous MVP Steph Curry shot - 40.3% from the field.  Klay Thompson, a career 43% 3pt shooter shot - 35% from the field."
"If Klay Thompson was a Laker, he'd fit the name. Dude always on a boat at a lake or something."
"I hope you’re right about me underrating him, but don’t feel that finding shooters for him is a realistic option.   When you look at the top 50 shooters in the league very few of them are positive defenders. That’s why Klay Thompson was so special for the Warriors, because he was a top level shooter at volume and a top level defender, every other player requires some sort of trade off.   Fox’s skillset is inherently one of a big man, since he requires paint penetration or the threat of paint penetration to be effective, other star guards bring that threat out to above the 3pt line. But I love his leadership and hope we can make it work, I don’t want to detract from that."
Klay Thompson
Booker looks like steph curry and klay Thompson had a baby
Hey remind me how much trouble Klay Thompson gave you? ;)
Yeah people trying to crown him the next Kobe have the same energy as those that crowned Wiggins the next LeBron. Booker isn’t even a current Klay Thompson
"Scott Foster turned Jrue Holiday into Klay Thompson, when will Chris Paul catch a break???"
Jae crowder is Klay Thompson when he’s not on Lebron’s team 😂
"Lol just stop. Klay Thompson was a two way player and a much better offensive player than Draymond. Defense isn’t as important as you’re making it out to be either. Tony Allen was one of the best defensive players of his generations. You can’t build a team around Draymond Green.  Offense, in particular scoring, has always been more valuable than defense when it comes to assessing individual players. Kawhi didn’t make an all star until he started scoring like one.   Averaging 23+ for multiple seasons and getting 25 a game is nothing to sneeze at. 6x all star as well. Draymond has never dominated in any major category. Perimeter defense is not a major category when assessing star players either. He’s honestly lucky he even made 4 all stars. Had he been playing for any other team other than the Warriors I doubt he would have been selected"
Shooting wise?  Klay Thompson
"A lot of people are stating opinions about who was better at what, who had the most well-rounded game, listing a bunch of GOATs, etc. but if we're talking about ""aesthetically pleasing"" as in ""god damn, what he does is on the regular just beautiful"" then I feel the need to nominate Klay Thompson for consideration. He has a very specific skill set, and good god is it pretty to watch.  Also I'd like to nominate Kawhi, especially his midrange shot. Thing of beauty and almost automatic."
Klay Thompson.
"I’m leaning on second, because we got second. And we beat the first place team three times. And have the best record against 0.500+ teams.  It’s so funny watching people unable to comprehend how good we are. 😎  Also the Lakers had an easy path without facing Klay Thompson so can we even say they should have been in the playoffs? 🧐"
Damn how much trouble did Klay Thompson give you tho
"He is the antithesis of an ideal modern day shooting guard. Mediocre defense, can’t shoot the three ball. Literally opposite Klay Thompson"
"gotta be Klay Thompson for me, just doesn’t waste a dribble and his shooting form"
Klay Thompson.
Made for Fit and in the Modern NBA? I'm assuming everyone is Healthy and In their Primes.  PG: Stephen Curry SG: Klay Thompson SF: Kawhi Leonard PF: Kevin Durant C: Tim Duncan  Coach By Pop.  If the Opposition goes big to body them up they run their shooters off screens and play the pick and roll with Steph and Timmy (who's a fantastic passer off the short roll as well); If they try to go small to keep up Tim gets fed in the post all game surrounded by shooters he'll makes the right play out of doubles and then they can swing like the Spurs from 2014. Everybody's Clutch and they can all shoot and score from all 3 levels (4/5 can post up too on mismatches).  Defensively they'd be great with two elite wings on ball and Tim Duncan giving orders from the backline. There isn't anyone they opponents could pick on except maybe Steph but then they'd have to hit a tough shot over Duncan or KD or pass out with Klay and Kawhi ball hawking.  These are all guys who are proven to like each other and play well together we've seen it work already for 8 Chips in this century. Pop can manage egos and The Big Fundamental will lead them on court.
"This probably isn’t the best ever, I just built one around Magic.  PG: Magic Johnson  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Larry Bird  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Allows Magic to distribute the ball to Bird, KD, or Kareem based on their matchup with Klay being more of a 5th option, catch and shoot kind of guy. Could’ve put a number of centers there instead of Kareem but we already know they are able to dominate together. Add in three of the most efficient scorers of all time, who all play good defense, and I think that team could compete with any others."
Yeah hes a great player somewhat like klay thompson but he isn't THAT guy
I think they’re about equal. Both are really hard to guard for different reasons. Steph can hit a fadeaway 3 from half court while triple teamed but Jokic is one of the best playmakers. Jokic with Klay Thompson as his wingman is a scary thing to think about. Imagine he was passing to someone who could hit that jump shot instead of MPJ or Mr 50.
I have noticed you saying the same thing three times now lol. Steph efficiency remains same without dray. Quit being so biased.  And Steph also plays on-ball. He is not Joe Harris or Klay thompson who can't create his shots off the dribble.
"Yeah he definitely could completely flop. I think the defense will remain great but assumedly come back to earth a bit(because 38% oFG% is just unrealistic to sustain) and his shooting might drop to league average.  I think he'll bump up to 20 ppg though and improve his ft%. He'll get a ton of easy drives to the basket when help defenders can't say off of Michael Mulder in the corner anymore, because instead klay Thompson will be right there."
"Kyrie’s got some serious Klay Thompson syndrome going on, where he only played part of the series so people pretend he wasn’t there at all.  Yeah the Nets series went to 7, 2 of their 3 wins were at home with Kyrie. We won our only home game where he was fully healthy and went 3-1 in the others, and that 1 loss was both the best game of Kevin Durant’s career and *by far* the best shooting performance of Jeff Green’s career to eek out a 6 point win.  If you want to talk about the Nets without “both their stars” (because KD doesn’t exist I guess) you shouldn’t be counting the first three games."
"Yea I’ll be Klay Thompson, thanks."
"And evidence of that is where??? He's been the main guy on Boston once and the team failed miserably. He can't be the main guy or the hero, but he can be a stellar second guy, just like klay thompson. Writing is hard."
"Actually other sports have done it.  But this guy explains why Lebron deserved the Finals MVP way better than I could:  *LeBron James is fighting an army by himself. He's probably going to lose, but he's not dying easily.*  James' average line in these NBA Finals is 36.6 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 8.4 assists per game.  **Only Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal and James Worthy** have managed to do that **in a single NBA Finals game** since 1986. **James is doing it every game.** *James is the only person to have 35 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in that time frame ... and he's done it three times in this series.*  *His 40-point triple-double in Game 5 was the first in decades. James had 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists by halftime, something nobody has done in any game -- finals, postseason or regular season -- since James entered the league.*  James is the Cavaliers' offense. He scored or assisted 16 of their 17 first half baskets, including every one in the second quarter. He ended up scoring or assisting 26 of their 32 field goals.  **He's doing this out of necessity. When James is on the court, the Cavaliers score 97.2 points per 100 possessions. When he is off the court, they score 54.6 points per 100 possessions. THAT IS VERY BAD.**  With Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love injured, the Cavs are down their second- and third-best players. None of LeBron's remaining teammates can create his own shots.  J.R. Smith loves trying, but he is woefully inefficient in doing so. Tristan Thompson can score on offensive rebounds, but isn't a great post-up player. Timofey Mozgov works best in the pick-and-roll, which needs James to act as ball-handler. There was one possession in Game 5 where Matthew Dellavedova tried going one-on-one with his defender. It looked like an escaped zoo animal trying to break out of a lasso after being hit with a tranquilizer dart.  There is no course of action for the Cavaliers besides just giving the ball to LeBron over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Against the NBA's best defense, this should end disastrously. But it hasn't been a complete disaster. It's been kind of close.  The Warriors are winning because they're a great team with several great players. Sometimes Stephen Curry is great! Sometimes Klay Thompson is great! Sometimes Andre Iguodala is great! Everybody's great! The Cavaliers have won two games and made two others close solely because LeBron James is playing like a demigod.   By the literal definition of the term, James has been the most valuable player in the NBA Finals.  But if the Cavaliers lose, don't bet on James receiving the award that goes to the most valuable player.  Once upon a time, it was reasonably common for players who put up astounding performances for losing teams to receive championship event MVP trophies, but sometime in the past 40 years or so, that trend fell out of style.  In the NBA, a losing player has only received the MVP once, when Jerry West won the award in 1969, the very first year an award was given. His was as preposterous as LeBron's. He averaged 38 points per game in a seven-game defeat to the Celtics and had a 42-point triple-double in Game 7, the only triple-double with a higher point total in finals history than James' Game 5.  The MLB and NFL have also given out MVP's to losing players just once, and both were a long time ago. The only losing World Series MVP was Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson in 1960. If that series were played now, the trophy would almost certainly go to Bill Mazeroski, who hit a walkoff home run in Game 7. The only losing Super Bowl MVP was Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley way back in Super Bowl V, in 1971.  Hockey players who lose the Stanley Cup are still kind of in the running for the Conn Smythe Trophy, but that's a bit more understandable because it's meant to reward the player with the best overall postseason performance, not merely the best performance in the decisive series. It's been given to losing players five times, with four being goaltenders. But this too is becoming increasingly rare. After two defeated players received the trophy in the first four years it was awarded, only one has gotten it in the past 25 years: Jean-Sebastian Giguere in 2003.  Whether the move away from rewarding losing players is a conscious effort on the part of leagues, a change in the voting procedures or thought processes for participating media or merely a coincidence is unclear. But it is clear that nobody is particularly interested in making an incredibly awkward moment happen.  Picture the scenario of the Warriors winning and James winning the MVP. The confetti-covered Warriors are celebrating their team's first championship in 40 years. It's the photo opportunity of a lifetime, a moment Warriors fans will cherish for decades to come.  And now Adam Silver has to speak into a microphone and tell everybody that none of them was good enough to win MVP. They have to stand aside as somebody goes searching for LeBron. Is he in the locker room? Does he come out, despite being devastated by defeat, to receive the trophy on stage? Does somebody go quietly bring it to him backstage? Does he even want the dang thing? Everybody involved hates it. The LeBron-hating contingent would go apoplectic, convinced once and for all that people will go to great lengths to praise James in spite of his consistent failures.  For these reasons, James will almost certainly need to will the Cavaliers to a win in Game 7 in order to be the NBA Finals MVP. If he doesn't, somebody on the Warriors -- probably Curry, perhaps Iguodala or somebody else depending on what happens in the future -- will get the award.  But let's not forget what James is doing against incredible odds.*"
"Honestly it does mostly depend on the rest of my squad. If I were building a team around one of those players, I would take Klay Thompson in case I need him at the three instead of the two. Not to mention he is a very good defender and excellent at the catch and shoot."
"**Klay Thompson**  He’s an All-Defense level defender while Beal doesn’t defend   Klay can fit in seamlessly in any system on any team and would work  Beal needs the ball to really score but you can’t win with him as your best player   If Klay was on a worse team, his numbers would be better too. This is the Durant situation all over again. A guy misses some time and everyone freaks out writing him off"
"Klay Thompson because without him the Warriors are a mediocre team at best (yes I know Steph Curry exists and even though he is on a division rival, I still love his game). Kyrie Irving is a big part of the Nets but when the Cavs didn’t have him, they still made the Finals. Nets didn’t have Kyrie and couldn’t take out the Bucks. I understand that the Cavs had LeBron but the Nets had both Harden and KD to help them. When the Warriors has Klay Thompson, they could have won 5 consecutive Finals."
"Klay Thompson is so overrated, no way he is a Top 20 guy let alone better than guys like Beal &amp; KAT."
"1.  Overrated doesn't mean ""negative value"".  You can be a positive player just not as positive as a lot of people think, hence ""overrated"". 2. Offensive flaws like Simmons' lack of shooting can be mitigated to some extent through roster construction and scheme, and the 76ers have done a decent job of that this season, but this doesn't excuse the flaw of the player.  If you transfer Simmons onto a random team there's a pretty good chance he's going to conflict with the strengths and weaknesses of that team and necessitate a reshuffle of some kind, whereas a player like for example (healthy) Klay Thompson you can just drop onto any team and he automatically makes them better."
This game needs Kristaps to come in and play like Klay Thompson in flip flops
"To be fair, one minute JR is Klay Thompson then the next he’s doing behind the back passes to someone sitting in the 3rd row"
"What can you do when Bobby ""Klay Thompson"" Portis and Khris "" Kevin Durant"" Middleton show up?"
Portis or Klay Thompson?
Klay Thompson should be the mvp. He hasn’t missed a single shot this year!
"Let's be real, 2012 Knicks were OP in 2k13. Like better than the Lakers. Melo was the 2nd best player in the game, Jason Kidd was still great. STAT was great, Chandler was great, and then you had the real MVP and 1st best player in the game Steve Novak.   I used to spank the Heat against my friends with that team. No one expected Steve Novak. Plus you had 2K god JR Smith there too and Iman ""Klay Thompson"" Shumpert"
"Fortunately, ~~Aang~~ Klay Thompson Will come out of his iceberg shortly"
Ok so what you are saying is if you added Klay Thompson to any of Allens teams and made the focus of the team creating open 3 point looks then his percentage would not have changed from what it is now?
"Not really, they’re just both 6’10 scoring forwards. That’s where the comparisons end. Beasley was like a 6’10 Melo/ old Blake Griffin combo he could beat guys off the dribble, take them to the post and back them down, or just shoot over them. MPJ is more like a 6’10 Klay Thompson who can just rise up and shoot over anyone. I dont see it"
"Playstyle wise is not even close. Michael Beasley is honestly one of the most skilled forwards of this era. Insane handles, footwork, and finishing ability. Just abysmal shot selection and effort. MPJ is just a flat out sniper. He's a taller Klay Thompson with better rebounding"
"Klay Alexander Thompson would never shoot like Steph ""Bum"" Curry"
You act as is Klay Thompson doesn't exist lol.
"Then you have Russell. A lotta people start Shaq, or have Duncan at C, or have Kareem, or have Wilt. I chose Russell because in a team like this, perhaps the most valuable ability is not requiring the ball so much and being able to pass. You already know his purpose. Provide intangibles like leadership and heart, dominate the rim, pass at an elite level, catch lobs, be a defensive beast. There isn't so much to talk about in his role, but that's precisely why I chose him. I don't want a ball dominant guy to dribble the clock for 20 seconds and throw up some fadeaway. I need my center to anchor a defense, protect the rim, switch and pass. Russell does all of that in spades, as the GOAT defender. Russell's ability to both floor and ceiling raise is the reason he had the most successful dynasty of all time. Do you think it's a coincidence Russell, a defense focused player with minimal offense led the greatest defensive dynasty of all time with minimal offense? Those Celtics teams were Russell, through and through. His attributes such as defense was the reason they were so successful. Speaking of defense.....  What you might have noticed is the balance of the team. 4/5 of this team is elite defensively, 4/5 of this team can shoot reliably, 4/5 of this team is elite offensively in general, 4/5 of this team has elite BBIQ, 4/5 of this team has ridiculous athleticism, 4/5 of this team can rebound great and 5/5 of this team can pass the ball. There won't be a confliction because everybody here can congeal and work as a team. MJ/Kobe/Harden/Wilt/Dirk might seem like a cool team but in reality it won't fit together. This team has essentially no weaknesses. For every Kevin Garnett offensive rebound, there will be a Steph dragging 2 defenders across the field leaving Jordan open for half a second. For every miss, there will be a Russell rebounding to Lebron to pass to the relocated Steph or layup by Russell. For every Bill Russell blocked shot, there will be a clutch MJ basket saving the game. The team works really nicely.  Next, the bench. Now, the bench isn't a lineup but it's players who will be played in certain lineups. Instantly, you have the king of facilitation, Magic. Showtime can slot into any non Lebron lineup as the main ballhandler and will be the engine of that lineup. As they conflict so much, I decided to not have them be on the same starting team. Having Lebron and Magic share the court might seem like the no brainer choice to many, but you soon realize how ineffective it would be. Lebron is going to be the ballhandler of any lineup he's in which leaves breadcrumbs for Magic. Having Magic as the bench player essentially assures the bench of leadership and flow, making sure his team has better synergy than the opposition. It's not like it's in his character to oppose it either, as he was willing to play second fiddle to Kareem for a few years. Magic with his height is able to shake things up in a way Steph can't as the backup PG. He can post up or pass from anywhere, and is similar to Lebron where his uncanny court vision assures you that he will make the right choice. His ridiculous build and height can offer a new vitality to the team which is super useful.  Then you have Klay Thompson. Personally, I can't believe this guy isn't on all time lineups more. He's so perfect for this kind of team. With so many faces who need the ball, you WANT a guy who doesn't even dribble, who shoots at an all time level after catching and goes right back to hunting his defensive assignment. He can pass, won't conflict with egos and stretch the floor when a certain lineup needs it. As a cherry on top, he can guard any guard or wing and do a damn good job.  Then you have Bird. I was originally going to have Durant there but I changed my mind. He's the 2nd clutchest player ever, so having him in non-MJ scenarios would be preferred, it would take some creative lineups to fulfill his potential. Able to stretch the floor like Steph and pass like Lebron, he has elite court vision and can be a leader at any time. His incredible array of moves means he is another player that can get you a bucket when needed. He's essentially ambidextrous to make up for his lack of athleticism and has a fantastic ability to manipulate defenses to free up opportunities to score and especially playmake. Against tougher defenses Birds offensive role inside will be minimized since it doesn't suit him, so Pop and Phill would play to his other skills like passing. Yet another guy who can pass the ball well, noticing a pattern? He will need the ball a bit so having so many passers on this team is great. A lineup of Steph/Klay/Bird/Duncan/Shaq might be a killer when you need offense.  Then, we have Duncan. You know, he's the last person I talked about and I had to add him in at the end because I forgot about him. That says alot about his style. Quiet, not flashy, but he gets the job done. He, like Garnett will focus on defense, any kind of defense. I trust him to get the job done. He's the little thing king. So much of what he does doesn't appear on the stat sheet. If this team ever happened, and they played a game, you'd probably look at the box score and think ""Huh, Duncan, meh performance... Disappointing..."" You wouldn't see the leadership and selflessness he displayed when the team was down 17, inspiring the team. You wouldn't see the rim protection, the pass leading to a pass, or the team play. In fact, I don't think he cares about those stats. For another video, I'd reccomend Thinking Basketballs Tim Duncan video or Clayton Crowleys video on Duncan. As I said before, I value BBIQ and passing, and with Duncan playing for Pop for 15 years, he certainly has those attributes. With so many superstars, it's nice to have a consistent guy like Duncan who can't really be gameplanned against that much.  Now, Shaq. Perhaps the most risky part of this team, he makes or breaks it. If he doesn't get along with the team, I'd just replace him with Hakeem or Kareem. But, if he DOES get along, what he offers can't be matched. With Curry like gravity, he's going to be essentially unstoppable. ""The most dominant player of all time."" That's his nickname, and it's earned. His ridiculous physique allowed him to bully his way into any position into the post and from there, he used his shocking finesse to get the bucket. Or he dunks over them. Either works. Players like Shaq and MJ are the reason this team has so many passers and floor stretchers. The less Klay has the ball while still stretching the floor, the greater Shaq will be. Imagine a lineup of Steph/Klay/Bird/Durant/Shaq. 4 out, 1 in, feasting. It'd be so damn nuts. He can rebound, defend and protect the rim, and is perhaps the most reliable and consistent bucket getter on the team. Pass to him and you have a 70% chance of 2 points. If he gets tripled, you have Bird or Klay ready to shoot. And if they are guarded, you probably have a high IQ player like Lebron ready to warp the defense to exploit the triple team, resulting in the most efficient shot. See Shaqs upside? All of that was possible thanks to him simply being, him.  Then, the last 2 are Rodman and Green. I was SO close to adding Pippen but removed him at the last second for Rodman. Dennis's main purpose will be acting as a rebounding and defensive plug when needed. I had lots of options but I took personalitites into account and I can't have say, Wilt as a 6th man. He wouldn't accept it. Draymonds main purpose would be providing the intangibles of spirit and fire, and acting as a ball handler. If Lebrons on the bench and Magic or Bird have been gameplanned against somehow, you have Draymond to fill that spot as the facilitator. He can't exactly shoot but in this lineup, you can play him smallball center or play Garnett at C to make up for it. Jordan/Steph/Klay/Dray/Garnett could be an unpredictable lineup but Jordan at 1 works. This team is just completely unstoppable. Running Lebron + 3nD? I'll go Magic/Jordan/Bird/Duncan/Shaq and feast on your vulnerable interior. Running an old school lineup? I'll go Steph/Klay/Bird/KD/Dray and burn you. This team literally cannot be beaten AT ALL because of the beautiful mix of BBIQ and playmaking. Players like Shaq are often used in ridiculous lineups like Magic/Kobe/MJ/Dirk/Shaq but be honest, does that lineup work? They're all great but this lineup, it's different. It synergises fantastically and brings the best out of everyone and with there being so many versatile options, it's essentially unbeatable."
"***Starters:***  ***PG:*** 2021 Steph Curry  ***SG:*** 1991 Michael Jordan  ***SF:*** 2018 Lebron James  ***PF:*** 2004 Kevin Garnett  ***C:*** 1964 Bill Russell  ***Bench:***  ***PG:*** 1987 Magic Johnson  ***SG:*** 2016 Klay Thompson  ***SF:*** 1986 Larry Bird  ***PF:*** 2003 Tim Duncan  ***C:*** 2001 Shaq  ***2 Reserves:***  1992 Dennis Rodman and 2016 Draymond Green.  ***Coaches***  Gregg Popovich (HC)  Phill Jackson (Assistant)  Alright, so I'll explain. First off, that starting lineup will probably be the most used line up, BUT the bench lineup will NOT be used like that all the time. You might be looking at it and thinking that there isn't enough movement, or shooting, or whatever, but we won't be strictly using that bench ever. Players on that bench will be slotted into specific lineups depending on whos hot or the opponents lineup.  As for the starters, I really like this lineup. The thing with it is, EVERY single player there is a) Elite in passing b) Elite in BBIQ and c) Offers something needed. First and foremost, you have Steph who is always going to be in these lineups, because he offers so much. He barely needs the ball which allows him to do so much with so little, truly raising the ceiling. He straight up has the most gravity of any player bar Shaq and he uses that gravity by stretching the defense into knots to exploit openings and defensive breakdowns. Who do we have to exploit those breakdowns? 4/5 of the team is elite at offense and shooting. Steph will be able to facilitate or pass to the facilitator, and because this whole team has great IQ, they can consistently make the most of Steph by tracking his off ball movement to relocate to him or get the open man. The chefs ridiculous shooting is just the quintessential necessity in these lineups. The reason he's so important and a starter is that he offers something no other player in the history of the game can offer. Not only this but he has an array of assets and skills that make him super important. He's super clutch and is very reliable down the stretch and is a good team defender. Able to make circus layups or logo shots, he makes any lineup a threat from 3 BY HIMSELF. He can pick up steals and act as a good leader and with his off ball movement, he's essentially unguardable. His shooting can shut the doors on a match with how nuclear hot he gets and his gravity can seal a win in any match as the triple teams he forces can be exploited. (By the way, I chose 2021 Steph as I believe he is at his peak right now. He can handle more contact, can carry better, has higher BBIQ, is stronger and is tougher mentally, all the while arguably shooting better, and more efficient in many ways, among many reasons.)  You have 2018 Lebron who I chose because while people love 2013, his 2018 was just more complete and dominant imo. He may not have the consistency of 2013, but he can dial in defensively when needed as he is still a living freight train in terms of build. With so much talent on this team, Lebron can focus on one specific attribute. If he's in a playmaking/offense filled lineup, we know he's athletic enough to be elite defensively, and he has the help in order to focus on that part of his game. If he's in a lineup of bigs and shooting is required, he can fufill that requirement. The 40% 3P% in 2013 seems like his best but it was on 3.3 attempts, he was shooting 37% on 5 attempts in 2018. Same story with FG%. His higher spacing in the Heat days gave him more room to shoot and drive through open lanes, he didn't have that luxury in 2018 yet he still did so well. When you need an instant bucket, you have potentially the most dangerous finisher of all time ready to ram through defenses, and these traits stayed in the playoffs. Essentially, he's acting as a jack of all trades. His main purpose in the majority of his usage will be playmaking though. It's precisely the reason I chose 2018. His mix of more experienced playmaking and much higher BBIQ makes him better suited than his younger days. You got an opening? I have no fear in passing to Lebron because he WILL make the right play. Whether that's a Russell lob or a relocated Steph 3, or a Jordan midrange, or his own drive into the lane, I trust him to be the primary ballhandler. Him in 2018 was able to do this best. Just control the game. Lebron can handle any assignment defensively when dialed in, but to conserve his energy, the team he's around will probably be elite defensively. This lets him focus on warping the match with his BBIQ. He acts as the glue of the team in a way. Imagine Draymond in 2016 but on steroids, or Magic with Karl Malones body.  Then you have Jordan. When it comes down to the clutch, he will ALWAYS be in the lineup. Game on the line, he gets the ball. If we need a 3, Steph gets the ball. You have the 2 clutchest players in Bird and the greatest scorer of all time, Jordan. Jordan really completes the team because of his pure transcendence in the field of scoring. Not only that but he has a very versatile skillset. He can pass at an elite level and shoot anywhere, (The team is too smart to have him be the one shooting from 3) He is GOING to be the leader of the team and thats invaluable. There's a reason I didn't choose Kobe or Wilt. Everyone on this team I believe can live with MJ being the leader, bar potentially Shaq. He might be the biggest risk but he also has the biggest upside, we'll talk about that later. Being able to have the goat scorer on your team who is ALSO the goat in clutch means we have a guy in bailout situations. Just pass it to MJ and he'll make something. His insane athleticism allowed him to process things at an insane pace. His consistency in his midrange came from his ability to find a good spot thanks to his good handles and speed, jump so high nobody can contest the shot and go into his form mid air. This ability to leap and use his incredible reflexes was imperative to his finishing as well as his incredible free throw drawing, absorbing contact and finishing through it. He mixed his ridiculous athleticism with potentially the deepest bag of moves of any guard ever, most notably the fadeaway. All of this allows him to benefit even more from all these elite passers like Magic, Bird, Russell, ect ect. The best thing about him is his postseason success. He was not fazed by pressure, he more so than anyone else in history thrived in it. He lived in the moments where games were decided, holding practically ALL of the playoff scoring records. He can also work as a 1 since he is an elite passer and has high BBIQ. His passing matured as he played more and is now super underrated as he improved his shot selection and court vision. He rebounds excellently thanks to his constant motor, the same motor that helped him earn a DPOY and become the greatest defensive guard. His off ball movement meant he could use his athleticism to get anywhere on the court. With any elite facilitator, (There are SO many on the team) that's lethal. He can just fly up and dunk whenever he wants, or rise for a jumpshot. He's going to be the centerpiece of any offense he's in, only ever splitting the cake with Shaq.  Now, you might see Garnett and be confused. He seems REALLY out of place, doesn't he? You usually have someone like Duncan there. Most lists don't have Garnett here. Well, for you, I'd recommend Thinking Basketballs Kevin Garnett: Greatest Peaks video. It is super awesome and useful in telling you how good he was. He was a 7 footer with the agility of a guard, footwork like Hakeem and offense like a guard. His greatest skill was perhaps the fact that he had the greatest fire and spirit out of anyone he played against. As you might have noticed, all of my players have either elite passing or elite bbiq, with exceptions for ridiculous players like Shaq. Garnett easily has that BBIQ. His help defense is absolutely insane, seemingly knowing what the enemy will do before they do, and arriving to obliterate shots as soon as the ball leaves the enemies hands, sometimes before. His positional and court awareness allowed him to prey on mismatches, read schemes and outrebound anyone. This help defense and rim protection is crucial for this team, because without him, the team softens up on team defense. He is ABSOLUTELY crucial for the team and I'd urge you to not underestimate him. With so many faces on the team who want the ball, Garnett won't be someone who holds the ball often, probably only for spot up shots and for some smart passes here and there. High BBIQ, remember? Garnett will be focusing his energy on rebounding, 1 on 1 defense and team defense."
"Why would anyone give him credit for winning the title with a prime Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green who had just won 73 games by themselves and a title the year before they. Like seriously, how do you expect people to give him credit for that? It’s just not impressive.   Brons 2018 run is impressive. KD’s titles were just expected"
"&gt; This is the only full season he’s played without Klay Thompson since they started winning.  The only other seasons he played without Klay were his rookie and sophomore seasons, so that's neither shocking nor the indictment you seem to think it is.  &gt; He cost them defensively every night.   Now I know you don't watch the games or have any clue about basketball lmao.  &gt; Ray almost won it all with Sam Cassell, Glenn Robinson, Darvin Ham and Vin Baker.  Is losing in the ECF (to a team that proceeded to get gentleman's swept) ""almost winning it all"" now? I guess a whole bunch of guys get to put ""almost NBA champion"" on their resume then.  I'd like to say your comment was the stupidest thing I've read in a long time, but that was actually the previous comment where you actually tried to say Ray Allen was better than Steph LMAO."
"i'll die on the hill that klay thompson has the best pure jumper the game has ever seen, whereas steph would be the best pure ""scorer"" given his insane ability off and on ball"
"Lebron’s 2016 team was closer to the KD/Russ/Ibaka Thunder team than it was to the current Nets or the KD Warriors. And Kevin Love put those stats up on some incredibly bad teams. Kevin Love is nowhere near Klay Thompson in terms of overall ability, let alone Steph Curry or James Harden. Call Lebron’s team a super team if you want, which it was *at the time*, before KD joined the Warriors and took it to the next level. The KD Warriors were the most stacked team of all time. 4 All Stars, all in their primes. The KD Nets have two of the most prolific and capable scorers in the history of the game. Lebron has never played with a teammate performing at the level of Steph Curry or James Harden. Period."
"Maybe playing like the D league, but they have legit NBA talent.  Once the playoffs roll around and Kerr tightens the rotations, it's gonna be a scary team. To me they are a Klay Thompson away from being a legit good team with defined roles. Once Oubre is a sixth man, the team would have been clicking.  I'm just surprised the Warrior's didn't even try to experiment with picking up people for this season. All that's needed to me is a decent perimeter player and a center possibly like Dewayne Dedmon who is giving decent back up minutes to the Heat."
"Anybody who says “Curry cost them defensively every night” has literally no clue what they’re talking about. Curry is an above average defender for his position. He got bad press as a defender in the 2016 Finals where he was switched onto every possession because he was next to Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut, and Andre Iguodala.  You say that like Curry is so bad defensively that he’s actually a negative on the floor despite his scoring 😂 watch some games bro"
Klay Thompson and CJ Mc
Klay Thompson tbh.
"This is one of the stupidest things I’ve read in a long time. Curry had weapons at points? This is the only full season he’s played without Klay Thompson since they started winning. They’re 29-29. He cost them defensively every night. Ray almost won it all with Sam Cassell, Glenn Robinson, Darvin Ham and Vin Baker. Are you in telling me you’d rather have that core than Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Iggy and Kevin Durant? Hollllllly shit. Certain points. Get the fuck outta here."
"Prime Monta Ellis played with rookie Steph Curry(who was already very effective) and prime David Lee and they went 36-46. Monta Ellis isn’t a player who gives you winning basketball. He led a bunch of tanking teams and the one time his team did make noise in the playoffs, he was a complete non-factor.   Klay is an elite defender, Ellis was a really bad defender, that’s already one side of the ball he has him beat on by a significant margin. Do you not know defense exists? Also you call Ellis a great shooter, but he shot below 30% from behind the arc 4 out of the 9 seasons he was in his prime.   You must be pretty young, you don’t even know that Klay Thompson is an elite defender or that Ellis wasn’t known for being a shooter. I suggest you do some research my nephew. ‘There’s nothing you can do to change my mind’ is an awful way to educate yourself."
"Bruh stop defending KD cause you’re a Nets fan 😂 Bron won in 2016 and 2020 without a super team, until KD does that his rings will just be seen as lesser.   Bron had just AD last year, KD had *Steph Curry* and *Klay Thompson* and *Draymond Green*. It’s 4 allstars in their prime, you’re kidding yourself and being biased if you don’t think winning on the Warriors was extremely easy for him."
"I don't know if there is a good NBA Jeter comp.  He was viewed by Yankee fans in the way Warrior fans view Steph, while, in terms of talent, being more like, idk, Klay Thompson?  Jeter was super popular and always a very good player in the regular season without being the best at his position.  2006 when he hit .343 was the closest he came to winning the MVP, finishing 2nd.  But, when the postseason came around, he just never feared the moment.  He had ice in his veins and would hit .350 &amp; .400 in the WS.  Even in his ""bad"" WS in 2001 (nobody on the team could get a hit off Schilling or Johnson), he had that clutch homerun off Byung Hyun Kim (Mr. November)."
Works for Klay Thompson
this is the new klay thompson copypasta 💀
"i mean it's very misleading to not include klay thompson - who has 5 - just because he's injured lol. he's not retired, you can't discount his seasons. that means it's 26 to 21  otherwise i could just wait for a game where curry sits for injury or rest and then say lillard and harden lead the league in games with 10 3s made amongst active players...maybe it's technically true, but it's intentionally misleading"
"He's way more explosive (Klay never had hops like that) and longer than Klay Thompson. Depending on what your definition of ""decent volume"" is, like if he's taking 200-300 3 point attempts per season on 38%, he'd get extremely expensive."
Klay Thompson
"Shaq, Curry, Kobe, Draymond, Klay Thompson.  Offensive GOATs from 0 ft to 40 ft out. One playmaking 1-5 DPOY caliber player, two All Defense wings, 3 great offball 1-3, and of course Shaq.  Plenty of players in a 1vacuum better than each of these. Don’t think any other starting 5 in history beats them. This assumes we can’t change anyone’s on-court persona."
Klay Thompson
"part of that is because there is so much more quality competing for those accolades like 1st team.  Magic and Bird, the Lakers and the Celtics, they owned the league on the 80s not only because they were great, but because the rest of the league really was not great (other than the 1983 Sixers)   Being the best player on the Lakers or Celtics was an automatic 1st team selection and a good shot at a ring.    Go look at the roster of the 1984 all-star game.  Jeff Ruland.  Kelly Tripuka.  Jim Paxson.  Rickey Green.  FFS.    Meanwhile, poor Dame Lillard gets aced out of all-star games for years because he happens to play guard in the same conference as Steph Curry, Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant, James Harden, Klay Thompson, Russ Westbrook. Chris Paul, Tony Parker, etc."
"But for current day:  Starters: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Rudy Gobert  Bench: Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Julius Randle, Nikola Jokic"
"Starters: Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Bill Russell  Bench: Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, Scottie Pippen, Pau Gasol, Ben Wallace  I feel like this would be a fun team that would work really well together chemistry wise, and be efficient on both ends with good spacing"
Klay Thompson on GS too obvious?
lol and dame's shots are so easy. curry has had 2-3 all stars next to him for the past 5 years. curry is obviously the better shooter on all fronts but come on now i would like to see dame's percents when his 3rd best player is klay thompson instead of al-farouq aminu
What stat says magic is better? Nash? You’ve gotta be kidding me. Oscar Robertson and Thomas are not close. Look at the offensive production of these warrior teams when curry is on the floor vs without. He’s the best pg nowadays. He’s proven it this year  Edit: Haha klay Thompson is my favorite player of all time 😂😂😂 I have ties to the place where he was born and watched him play in high school
"So, hypotetically, what statline would it take for Steph to pull that off? Like 50 pts a game on insane efficiency? Unless Draymond plays at that Finals game 7 level and Wiggs animorphs into Klay Thompson.  ...I'd be down tbh."
If he can shoot 38% on decent volume he’s literally Klay Thompson with better defense and slightly worse shooting.
A healthy Klay Thompson to the Warriors
DAMN and that's without Klay Thompson opening the floor for him 🤯🤯
"That has to be such a terrible statement because obviously he doesn’t need to carry a team if there are multiple all stars and not to mention this man led a team to 73 wins with klay Thompson and draymond green as his second and third best players, if that isn’t carrying idk what is tbh."
His name is Klay Thompson. Some people even call them ‘sploosh brothers’ or something like that
*Klay Thompson
Luck is a factor people just dont want to factor in. Lebron most recent injury was simply bad luck.  Half of kyries injuries were bad luck. Rock embedded in his knee cap from a skateboard accident as a kid --&gt; Klay thompson kneeing right in that exact spot(2015) --&gt; Knee Surgery(2015) --&gt; Knee Surgery to remove metal plates(2017) --&gt; Knee infection(2017).  That chain cost kyrie like 100 games.
Didn't want to lose a subscriber in Klay Thompson

Klay Thompson G6 2016 WCF 11 threes  Klay Thompson 2016-17 VS Indiana 60 points
"His current level of play over his last 20 games is 21.5ppg, 8.9rpg, on 67.2% true shooting.   That's a max player already. Klay Thompson inked a max contract after an 18.4/3/2 on 55%true shooting 3rd year."
I welcome the trivia aspect of Klay Thompson holding the single-game 3PT record of 14 despite Steph Curry making 15 in the play-in.
I would say his floor is more of a budget Klay Thompson but 6’10”. His ability to drop 20 with very few dribbles is Klay-esque and his shooting this year has been insane. Has to prove it over a longer period though
"Yeah. Handles are one of the most commonly improved skills though. And even if he doesn’t the floor still resembles a Klay Thompson mold. He has to prove it over a longer period but his shooting this year has been insane, especially accounting for difficulty. His height allows him to basically shoot over anyone"

I think best would be a team that can shoot 3s and also switch 1-5.  Chris Paul  Klay Thompson  Kawhi Leonard   LeBron James  Kevin Garnett  6th man - Kobe
"In person: Derrick Rose and LeBron trading back-to-back game winners in 2015, performance-wise they were kind of whatever but obviously that just really sticks out to me         On TV live: I don't know there's quite a few, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell going back and forth in the bubble was crazy, Kevin Durant game 3 in 2018, Klay Thompson game 6 in 2016, LeBron's performance in the Cavaliers come back in 2016 and so on, it's tough to just pick one of those live, but if I absolutely positively had to pick a game that I saw live I guess I will go with LeBron's game 6 against the Celtics in 2012, I think it's still the greatest game he's ever played, he just looked.... different that night, like the motherfuker was possessed or something lol"
"Isiah will always be highly valued by Basketball People.  The people who view the game as a living thing that flows and changes based on the conditions presented.  By people who view box scores and stats, and view the sport through a data-driven or analytics lens they just don't appreciate his style of play.  Isiah gets punished for recognizing at age 26 that him scoring 20+ and 10+ assists were only going to get his team so far.  He recognized his limitations as player and at his size. So he left the night in and night out production in the regular season to become a conductor. If he pursues stats he goes down as Tiny Archibald, AI, etc little guys who filled up the stat sheets, but had little success in the NBA as top tier players. He gave up stats for championships/team success.  No other PG has done that in nearly 30+ years since.  Steph Curry 2015 championship came the closest, with Curry having 23 and 7, but we can argue Klay Thompson is better than anyone Thomas played with outside Adrian Dantely.  Guy who can score, love to score.  Thats what Thomas was. He was a scorer, who dominated the ball.  CP3, Nash, Stockton, they all dominate the ball.  People don't think that because they have these assist numbers.  But running offense is about more than getting an assist, its about putting your team in position to be successful.  The Pistons played offense where they ran, they played it in the half-court, the x-factor was Thomas did all that, and still had the feel for the game when to call his on number, stop runs, get buckets to break out of series of poor possessions.  All done within a team concept that resulted in winning.  Basketball people are still looking for the next Thomas and they thought they had it in D. Rose before his legs exploded.  Strangely enough D.Rose's stats aren't that sexy either, but we all say what we saw when he was in top-form."
"Trent will never be a bargain at 20 million.   3 and D guys end up being the most overpaid players in the league, second only to volume scorers (like CJ). The only 3 and D player in the entire league worth 20 million is Klay Thompson.  This is especially true considering Trent isn't actually good at defense right now and doesn't have the ability to play up a position on defense. Pure guard defense is pretty meaningless unless you're a Jrue or Smart caliber guy.   He's a streaky shooter that loves inefficient mids, can't finish, and truly does not pass. Like almost ever. He's genuinely one of the most selfish guys in the league. Blazers fans were starting to get a little annoyed at it once the shiny newness of him wore off.  He's a fucking psychopath with an insane work ethic who is going to be a very solid player. But he won't come close to being worth what he's making next season"

"Curry has Klay Thompson. I don't care that he's not playing, he seems like a good dude to have around"
I'm pretty sure that Klay Thompson has a higher chance of hitting two shots in a row rather than hitting a shot after a miss.
"I guess I would ask first: What do you want to see out of Luka?     My first two go-tos were an aging LeBron, or current Durant. Both are so skilled on offense that they have the luxury of looking at their team on the floor, and just filling in the gaps seemingly effortlessly. (The transformation of Harden's game since moving to Brooklyn makes me want to throw him in here too, but I didn't, whatever) I say an aging LeBron here because in his PRIME prime, you'd be either wasting him or Luka a little bit because of how ball dominant both of them should be, but a LeBron in his later 30's, looking to save a little mileage and still 90-95% as good as he ever was? That's a wrap.     Next are the big men partners: AD or Embiid would be amazing. Both fierce rim-protectors, both able to score at will down low, both comfortable with midrange shots, AD has the edge over Joel at shooting 3's, but if both are healthy and trying their hardest, that's about the only edge I'd give Davis. Giannis would be an incredible partner, too, but I leave him third in here due to long range shooting. Pair Luka with any of these guys, and you have something potentially better than a Stockton/Malone combo, and that shit was amazing.     For guards, I'm thinking of someone where Luka CAN be the main guy, but doesn't always have to be. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson come to mind. Both of them have no problem not bringing the ball up and initiating the offense, but instead running all over the court through a million picks and setting screens for their teammates. This opens up so much for Doncic with the opposing teams terrified of his marksman teammates, and having to settle into something like a zone defense, or at least strongly discouraging opposing defenses from doubling too often. Also into this group I'd toss Kyrie, who is at his best, IMO, when there's a second option as good or better than him. As a wild card, I'll throw in Ja Morant, just because I'd love to watch it."
"Do the Warriors need him to do anything else? I mean yeah if he was Klay Thompson that'd be nice, but guarding the best guard on the court while Steph sits is about all they can ask for with their cap and roster situation."
"Gobert would be the perfect Center for this team. Great rim-protector, better finisher than Adams and also sets picks even better than Adams. Imagine if they had a version of Klay Thompson as the 2-guard. Ingram needs to improve his playmaking and defense, he is at most the third best player on a really good team. Lonzo prob should be traded, he combines well with Zion, but don't think he is gonna be worth the money he will be asking for."
Well he’s been injured which hasn’t happened up until this point in his career and when he’s not injured he’s Klay Thompson...they’ll be alright
"Another fun stat, number of games with 20 or more 3PA  &amp;#x200B;  ||| |:-|:-| |James Harden|7| |Stephen Curry|2| |Klay Thompson|1| |Marcus Smart|1| |J.R. Smith|1| |Danny Green|1| |Buddy Hield|1| |Kobe Bryant*|1| |Damon Stoudamire|1| |Damian Lillard|1| |Vince Carter|1| |George McCloud|1| |Michael Adams|1|"
"Honestly, this just shows how fucking incredibly klay thompson is.   I keep thinking about guys like Harris and Ingles shooting lights out as the NBA has leaned even more into the 3 point game... Fuck  I miss u bby"
"If Klay Thompson was healthy, Curry would be getting his 2nd unanimous MVP award this season  Just bonkers how well he is playing. He's easily the most *valuable* player this year, but because the roster around him is so bad, he won't win MVP. Not because of anything to do with him, but because of the rest of his team. Man that's crazy."
"PG: Magic (87) Magic would initiate the offense, though there would be a lot of motion so he would post up and cut around quite a bit. Defensively i’d have him guarding Lebron, same size and build, he’ll have his work cut out for him but so would Lebron.  SG: Jordan (96) Jordan is the primary scorer for this team, but his main role is guarding Curry. He’s face guarding Curry the whole game and just being physical, while taking advantage of the size mismatch offensively.  SF: Klay Thompson (16) Klay would guard Kawhi here, but he’d be great to switch onto Curry or even James at times. Offensively his shooting would be extremely valuable as both Magic and Jordan would have more space to work with, not to mention Klay is one of the greatest shooters ever.  PF: Paul George (19) George is mainly here to matchup with KD. He’s one of the best options to guard KD (which is essentially impossible) but with his length and skill he’d put up a fight. Offensively he can handle the ball and create his own shot, while also stretching the floor.  C: Shaquille O’neal (00) Shaq is dominant. He’s the best matchup for Hakeem here, as I feel they would both just be giving eachother fits the whole game/series with how big and physical they both are."
"Steph has 11 games of making 11+ threes  He has 21 games of making 10+ threes.  Klay Thompson is second in double digit threes with 5.  So Steph has more than 4 times as many such games as second place, and he has 7 times as many such games as third place."
Said it before. His only sin is that he's not able to replace Klay Thompson. Role players need specific roles.
"i dont think kerr or the front office was ever worried about klay thompson--a great man defender on basically anyone on the perimeter--moving away from checking small guards and going towards guarding bigger wings as he reached past 30 and coming off an acl injury.  what im trying to say is the fit was there no matter what, but obviously center was a bigger area of need and they found that wiseman was the better choice no matter what."
"Well, Klay Thompson is injured and Kevin Durant is on the Nets."
Most 10+ 3pm games in NBA history  * Steph Curry 20 * Klay Thompson 5 * James Harden 3 * Damian Lillard 3 * JR Smith 3 * Zach Lavine 2 * Rest of the league combined 5
"Luckily he’s getting Klay back next year.  I don’t give a fuck, 50% of Klay Thompson on a damn wheelchair is better than giving Baze and Damion Lee clutch minutes."
"besides Klay, no one else has more than three. Steph had as many/more 10+ three games this past week than any other player in NBA history not named Klay Thompson had in their entire career."
"We go from Klay Thompson, 60 points in 29 minutes, 14 threes in a game, 37 points in one quarter. To Kent Bazemore, can’t hit 2 free throws"
The Warriors don’t have Klay Thompson.... they will be so good
Klay Thompson MVP
I raise you one Klay Thompson
That's not the point. I didn't say Steph wasn't an upgrade. I said he wasn't enough of an upgrade to make it worth it. Thompson vs McCollum is a completely different scenario. Klay is a better shooter and a significantly better defender than CJ on top of that.
Klay “Reverse Waterfall” Thompson has the best shot I’ve ever seen.
Klay Thompson has a shot you’d put in an instructional video for kids to teach them how to shoot. Flawless motion.
Klay Thompson
umm ok then go ahead and believe that Klay Thompson as a main option would magically average 6 more points than his career high and take a massive jump in efficiency without being a better than decent shot creator. If you believe you’re right then hold your opinion.
ilyasova turning into klay thompson is not what I expected
Do you seriously think a developing Minnesota Lavine on a bad team Vs Prime Klay Thompson with playing with Steph/KD/Dray is a fair comparison?
Klay Thompson and Duncan Robinson
is Klay Thompson a superstar-tier player or are we being super generous with that term? Has he ever had superstar responsibilities? he’s benefitted from not having to.
You think he can be better than Klay Thompson? Are you saying he will develop to become the second greatest shooter of all time? I love thisse but calm down.
Klay Thompson? Most flexible player of history? Could play on literally any team average 20 a game while giving you all nba level defense?
"I think Klay Thompson might be untradable atm as well, but for the wrong reasons."
"Being really good at one skill doesn't mean he's skilled. Nobody's mind jumps to klay Thompson when thinking of a skilled player, despite him being arguably the 2nd best shooter ever. People think of more versatile players like cp3. Same thing should be true with bron, he doesnt have a super great handle, or shot, or footwork, yet people freak out when someone says he isn't that skilled"
"Ladies and gentleman, KLAY THOMPSON! Leading the MVP advanced stat!"
Most notably not on that list: Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.
"Gotta be Trent for me. Guy is a 3&amp;D player but has shown plenty of glimpses for being able to do it on high volume; I'm reminded of Klay Thompson when watching him. More importantly, Herro looks like he's regressed this year. I'm buying high on Trent."
"&gt; for us tiger woods is black cause his skin is black and there is not much more to it  That seems like an odd way to judge it though. For example would you not consider a guy like Klay Thompson to be black? Not to mention, a lot of Indian people (especially in the South) are much, much darker than Tiger Woods, but Indian people are certainly not considered “black” at all."
"Kevin Huerter.  Red Velvet on paper has the shooting, size, athleticism,  and a surprising handle and playmaking ability but when I see takes that he's secretly a ball handling Klay Thompson on a bad team I gotta shake my head."
Well no. It would maybe be a Klay Thompson vs Joe Harris. But steph shoots in completely different ways and compared to the people who shoot in the same ways as him he obliterates them in efficiency.  You could maybe say steph vs Lavine as he's one of the only one whose shooting on c+s and off the dribble are both elite with a good number of possessions each like steph.
"I like to think of them in a tier list like in smash bros or something. The players you mentioned are S tier (not sure why S is higher than A), and guys like Klay Thompson, Kyrie, Paul George are A tier. There's no reason the top tier has to be restricted to five players."
Klay Thompson had a good one
"Nobody at the barber shop is going to laugh at guys like Manu Ginobili, Chris Bosh, Pau Gasol, Klay Thompson, or Rajon Rondo if they come in and talk about winning championships.  Bogut wasn't talking about the Samaki Walkers of the league."
Could you imagine the bombshell of Woj dropping the night before the play in game “Golden State Star Shooting Guard Klay Thompson will be making his unexpected return tomorrow night against the Lakers” like bro I would be so hype
"The main difference for me is he plays in a much worse spacing and teams are completely focused to stop him. Klay Thompson aside, even Draymond shooting %40 behind the line that year."
"No F'ing way. Draymond is not likeable from all his on-court antics. Don't like the showboat Steph. Klay Thompson is the most likeable but he's not even playing. But really, they don't all need a 4th ring. Would much rather see a new team win like Suns/Jazz/Nuggets. Realistically, I'll be rooting for anyone the Warriors OR the Lakers face."
"Now I'm picturing steph looking over to the crowd at klay thompson, who is inexplicably dressed as doctor strange and slowly raises one hand with one finger pointing upward mouthing ""and one""  And it has me giggling."
Lol lebron in top 5? May as well put klay thompson in while ur at it
"Game 6 of the 2016 WCF, Klay Thompson gives me PTSD"
Is he though? The cap is like 109 million. 11 millions sounds about right. He was coming off of an Achilles injury right? His game is all about hustler explosion so it make sense that it took him awhile to get back.  If we are counting injuries than klay Thompson has been bad value since has has missed two years in a row
In 64 games this year klay Thompson is averaging 0 points per game
If you win mvp by not playing games I think Klay Thompson deserves consideration
"I’m not gonna engage in a pissing contest over this lol. Bro, you’re arguing with me at 3 in the morning about Klay Thompson. Enough said"
"You wanted to talk about Lue having LeBron so I thought I’d remind you who Steve Kerr’s had.  - Michael Jordan  - Scottie Pippen  - Dennis Rodman  - Tim Duncan  - David Robinson  - Toni Kukoc  - Brad Daugherty  - Larry Nance Sr.  - Tony Parker  - Manu Ginobili  - Shawn Kemp  - Steve Smith  - Shaquille O’Neal  - Tom Chambers  - Steve Nash  - Amar’e Stoudemire  - Steph Curry  - Klay Thompson  - Kevin Durant  - Andre Iguodala  - Greg Popavich  Odds are I missed some names but if you want to say Lue had help then Steve Kerr had help with a capital H, E, L and P."
"Klay Thompson is a shooter, Joe Harris is a shooter, Duncan Robinson is a shooter- you don't hear any complains about them. Hield's problem is that he thinks his individual accolades as a college senior are worth a damn in the NBA. He still seems to believe that all those Player of the Year awards should at least translate to him being a number one option."
"He is already around his prime and his ceiling is only slightly better than he is now, nowhere close to klay Thompson, that's ridiculous"
That's pretty disrespectful to Klay Thompson
"Fairly decent list, but recent All-stars should not be exempt because Khris Middleton is one of the best 3&amp;D players &amp; Klay Thompson is probably the GOAT3&amp;D.  7 Gordan Hayward is a playmaker &amp; a tone setter, you should feel weird putting him here because it is)  13 Tobias Harris is avg 20ppg, he's more of a dynamic scorer than 3&amp;D  19 When I think of Brogdan, I think Primary Ball-handler  25 Andrew Wiggins, haven't watched much GSW but in Minn, he was a scorer, has he turned into a shooter?  28 FVV was draining unassisted 35 footers in the 2019 NBA Finals while sharing the court with Kawhi, Lowry &amp; Beyblade"
*Klay Thompson has entered the chat *
"That's really depressing. He was never going to turn into Klay Thompson, but against all odds Vivek's fascination with Buddy was paying off, and then it got derailed for no good reason."
Not allowing all stars on this list robbed us of the 3&amp;D goat Klay Thompson.
"I think you need to put in the definition that a 3&amp;D guy needs to be great at catch and shoots, and has to move very well off the ball in order to create good catch and shoot opportunities.  Klay is the prototypical 3&amp;D guy. People saw him in GS and thought: yeap, we just need to have a pooran's Klay Thompson."
In all honesty I’m wondering why would he even need a handle at this point. What’s stopping him from running around screens in a motion offense around Jokic like a 6’10 Klay Thompson.
"He's definitely improved this season, especially on Defense.   However, he's still more of a solid bench player at this point because he hasn't made a huge jump on offense as compared to some of the other guys that play the same position (DeAndre Hunter, Bogdan Bogdanovic).  The future looks bright for Huerter. We'll see how he performs in the playoffs, but one thing is for sure. He has a TJ McConnell type of ceiling when it comes to playing on-ball Defense. Hes averaging the most steals on the Hawks this season (also his career best) and it seems under Nate McMillan he's only going to get better.  As for the Klay Thompson comparison, I don't think that holds up too well at least so far in his career. Kevin isn't as good of a shooter even though he's one of the many 3p threats on the Hawks. In my personal opinion, Klay is a super high IQ basketball player and his in-game decision making is what separates him from a lot of guys. Huerter is young but he hasn't shown that kind of brilliance yet. Although he has potential so you never know."
Klay Thompson and Danny Garcia
"You must be joking. A bench player and lower tier all star for Klay Thompson just isn't a deal the Warriors would accept. Don't get me wrong, Sabonis is really good, but not good enough for the Warriors to consider giving up one of their best players. It would take an All-Star plus a good quality role player to get the Dubs to give away Klay"
Klay Thompson and Tatum share the rights to that record
I notice klay Thompson wasn't mentioned in this post
How about Klay Thompson? Oubre wont re sign to come off the bench
All KT Team  PG: Kenny Tyler from “The Sixth Man”  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Khloe’s babydaddy Tristan Thompson  PF: Killian Tillie  C: Karl-Anthony Towns  6th man: Kris Tapsporzingis
"No shit you’d trade him for Porzingis if you’re Dallas, just like we’d trade FVV for Klay Thompson if we’re Toronto. The thing is that both teams need to agree to a trade though"
[Kevin Durant says he speaks with Klay Thompson a couple of times a week](https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2021/02/14/kevin-durant-says-he-speaks-with-klay-thompson-a-couple-of-times-a-week/).   I was shitposting but I think they are actually tight.
"Hindsight is 20/20. No one thought Jokic would be this good. Most people probably had him as a career role player at most.  For every horrible incorrect prediction, there's one amazing correct prediction that everyone makes.  Over the years, I've had some really bad takes about players I thought would become superstars pre-draft: Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Wiggins, Fultz, Marqueese Chris. Then there's been players I thought would be generational talents that i hit on: Luka Doncic, Lamelo, Klay Thompson."
Klay thompson
&gt;Five Finals.  -Klay Thompson
Klay thompson at the peak of his powers
Klay Thompson sleeps in and drops 60
"Actually, IIRC he’s a great defender too. Dude blocked a Kagami dunk. He’s also 6’5 at like 16 so honestly he could’ve had the longest NBA career out of all of them because he’s basically Klay Thompson."
Duncan Robinson and Klay Thompson have more automatic looking catch and shoots.
&gt; but purely as a scorer I think Porter is better  But I also think that's because he's coming off screens to get his shot. So most of those shots are fairly open. I'll take the guy that can score with the ball every time. Klay Thompson is the perfect example of this. There is no Klay Thompson without a Steph Curry type of player along side him.
Is Robinson a better 3&amp;D player than Klay Thompson??
Steph Curry Alex Caruso Klay Thompson Udonis Haslem Tacko Fall
I'd argue MPJ's stretched out Klay Thompson game is harder to find than a quality PG today lol
"I think MPJ's peak can be a similar Klay Thompson if he doesnt develop his handle. Not as much of an on-ball defender as Klay but a better shot blocker. My only problem with mpj is his on-ball defense. BI is a better on ball defender compared to MPJ right now. MPJ would probably be a less accurate 3 pt shooter than Klay but can be a very streaky one. If MPJ develops his defense and shooting, I can see his peak being that of a more athletic Klay Thompson with a little less shooting prowess. I dont see MPJ being the number 1 option on a championship team but a very good 2nd option at his peak (Think Klay Thompson game 6 heroics). I would say 25pts per game as a 2nd option on a championship team.   As a comparison, I view BI as a 3rd option on a championship team. Probably the same as how I view that the bucks will never win a championship with Kate Middleton as their 2nd option as I see Kate being more optimal as a 3rd option on a championship team."
"Then Klay Thompson isn't a 3 point shooter either, neither is Khris Middleton."
True Klay Thompson biggest MVP snub of 2021
"Half a game out from the 8 seed, 3 from the 7 and have   like the 2nd easiest schedule left. Oh we're making it.  A down year because our best players were injured and we still waiting KLAY THOMPSON while all your hopes and dreams are now on another team lol. As if you would try take a dig at us for being trash you must have forgotten to change your flair.  HARDEN IS GONE."
"Its still obvious that he would be great at 3 point range tho.   ¨we know the source isn't credible because Bill Walton said it was in a Pete Maravich biography but there is absolutely mention of it in the book in question¨  Interesting, where did you find this info?  ¨And there's obviously lots of footage of his NBA career. Did he drastically change the way he played basketball when he got to the NBA? Because again, he definitely wasn't taking that many shots from 3 point range in the NBA either.¨  No theres not that much or lots of footage from his nba career. He did kind of drastically change because he was passing alot more when he got to the Nba. But there were still many shots taken from 3 point range when he got to the nba. Remember the question is ¨how good would he be today¨ so think of how many 3s he is taking in 2021 and how many he is making. Almost like a Steph Curry or a Klay Thompson atleast on offense"
"I’m only being negative about the Wolves future because Glen Taylor is still the owner and the Wolves suck, not because of KAT though. And I was just stating how KAT could be in the conversation of being an MVP candidate when we won’t know when the Timberwolves will be at least in 4th seeding. Nothing to do with a HoF coach, and Curry, and a injured Klay Thompson, and a terrible GS team."
There’s no way they trade Klay Thompson. Draymond would roast the Warriors every time he was on the mic.
I think I might put Penny Hardaway over Klay Thompson at SG.
"Yeah, we should have spent less attention to Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson to... seal off iggy lmao. The only reason we couldn't close a couple games was kyrie being a complete god damn head case."
They might as well trade away curry if they’re concerned about salvaging the second half of his prime at the expense of klay Thompson. I don’t think they’ll get back into contention without an 80-90% Klay
"Not healthy this year, but Klay Thompson"
If Danny green doesn’t run into Klay Thompson under the basket on a breakaway I feel like they’d have at-least won game 6 in 18-19. That’s just my take though.
"Does a healthy Klay Thompson really turn 10 losses out of 30 into wins?   They lose by an average of 15 points per game across their 31 losses this year.   I don't understand how Klay Thompson turns a .500 team into a finals contender. A top 4 seed? Probably, but there's too many issues with their roster for Klay alone to make them a true finals contender"
Replace Klay Thompson with Steph Curry and it's 5000+ upvotes 😂
"I mean if we're gonna make an NBA comparison for him strictly based on last night's game, why not go Klay Thompson? Fuck it"
Klay Thompson.  He even missed his last three that broke his perfect shooting streak.  /s
Posting GSW are undefeated when klay Thompson scores 40 would have been a better post
"My guy, LeBron is literally 3rd all time in scoring at a career 50% fg and 34,5 % from 3. He averages literally the same ppg KD does. KD is certainly the more effortless scorer but acting like he is in a nother stratosphere compared to LeBron is extremely weird thinking, LeBron was the youngest to every scoring milestone ever lmao. LeBron blows KD out of the water when it comes to playmaking/assists, rebounding is the same and defense LeBron is better. KD is not a leader at all either, hence him joining Curry and Klay Thompson and now Kyrie and Harden. Just give up you have no case bruh"
"Draymond isn't a max contract guy, his offense is the reason he's not getting Klay Thompson money. If Wiggins and Oubre can't drive with high efficiency, what makes people think Draymond who can't post, drive, or shoot the 3 can do anything? Literally all his field goals are lightly contested if at all, and that's completely dependent on what opposing defense gives him. FGA in reality doesn't tell anything useful without understanding what defense was played. 1-10 is almost equivalent to 9 turnovers or at least 9 wasted possessions, it's SIGNIFICANTLY better than going 0/1 because those possessions are going somewhere else."
"See, the problem is that Draymond has been made out to be a far better player than he actually, which is my point. He might be a good, even great, defender, but so was Tony Allen. Did Tony Allen ever make any all star teams? Are people questioning whether or not Tony Allen is making the hall of fame? The reason draymond made any all star teams or even has people wondering if he might make the hall of fame is because, as I said, he was propped up by KD, Curry and Thompson. You might expect a player with those type of credentials to be able to do anything useful as a solo star but every time we see draymond without curry, kd or Klay he has been all but useless and for whatever reason he gets a ""pass""."
"So suddenly Westbrook is a bad player? I thought that it was just a bad game. Can you please remain consistent?  Also, Klay Thompson wasn't on his team then."
"Injuries are not something can be foreseen. We're talking about the Warriors when they were healthy. Like, no shit, having Kevin Durant on your team helps in any situation. But did they *need* him from 2017-2019? Key word being 'need'. He was a luxury for an already all-time great team.   And I'm pretty sure Draymond was fucking right considering that they literally did win without him, then had a solid chance of winning again if Klay Thompson didn't get injured in the Finals."
"Yeah dude, the 2016 Warriors are definitely the same as the 2021.  Of course we needed Durant after our bench aged out, Klay Thompson is injured, and we are no longer an FA destination."
"Im not using anyone I even remotely commonly see as top 5, so no Kobe, Shaq, or Hakeem either   PG - Steph Curry  SG - Dwyane Wade  SF - Klay Thompson  PF - Kevin Durant  C - Anthony Davis   Ridiculous defense, ridiculous spacing, with one of the best cutters ever to abuse it."
"What exactly is a good team to you then? Comparing any of his teams to the 1 recent year of the pistons making the playoffs with a 41 and 41 record is not even comparable.  Russ has never had a season at .500 or below ever in his career other than his first season, the year him and Kevin durant were both hurt and now this year. You keeping stretching your goal post over and over. First it's ""none of the teams were good"" which is technically wrong. Comparing his 10 years of playoff births where his worst season was with a mvp James harden at 44 wins. Finishing 5 times above 50 and 4 times above 47 to a pistons 41 and 41 appearance in the east is laughable. Then you stretch it to ""he's not anyone I'm going to tell my grandkids about"" ok? Who cares what you tell your grandkids about basketball players.   The only time other than this year that russ has had a chance to ""lead a team to a super star without an mvp"" are the years the warriors had kevin durant. After that he was paired with another mvp named james harden.   Of course the teams led by russ with no other mvps he had no chance of winning, nobody in their right minds would pick the thunder after losing durant to the warriors over the warriors with Kevin durant.   If you mean ""none of the teams russ IS on have a chance of winning a title"" then that's a fair argument. His playstyle is not imo championships caliber. But cmon, the only time he didn't have an mvp besides this current season is when kevin durant joined Steph curry klay thompson and draymond....nobody but lebron and luck could stop that. That is not russ fault."
It was never a tie game in the 4th. The Warriors were never down in the 4th.  Look at his horrible performance in Game 6. In that game it was Klay Thompson who brought the Warriors back. Klay Thompson gave the Warriors the lead.
I guess Klay Thompson and Draymond Green dont exist?
"He was so bad in the playoffs, especially against good teams like GSW. He was a total sieve on defense against them and couldn't even post up players like Klay Thompson."
"In NBA history, Klay Thompson has the second most career games with 10+ threes: 5   Nobody else has more than 3 such games in their entire career.   Curry had 4 such games in a 5-game span."
"Probably Klay Thompson, before the injuries of course, I don't like a shit ton of attention on me, but I am competitive and I do like to win, I also like engaging an herbal medication and fucking Instagram hoes while contributing valuably to my team's Championship success over the years, I'm pretty chill and laid back as well            Now I answered the question based on who I kind of relate to I guess, but if there was a time limit on this hopefully and it was just like a 2-day trial run, give me Kyrie Irving I got to see this dude's fucking thought process lol"
deadass a 6”10 Klay Thompson
"MPJ has been playing as a second option and scoring 26 in the last 8 on better efficiency. He’s scoring more off the dribble, hitting more mid ranges off screens and is arguable the most efficient player in the league.  Shai is a good player just doesn’t have the it factor and looked like shit in the playoffs. I’m just telling you that 0 gm in the league would pick Shai in a draft right now. Shai will never be 6’10” with a Klay Thompson jump shot."
A couple of things.   Klay got maximized because he is the best at the role Bosh and Love were playing. A low usage elite 3-point shooter with great defense. Give Prime Klay Thompson to LeBron James and see what happens.  Bosh and Love suffered their offensive production because they were bigs and bigs unlike the likes of Russ/Curry/Harden/Kyrie etc need to be fed regularly. They can't just get the ball and go ISO mode.
Assistant coach Klay Thompson for remainder of season
Certainly not Kobe but definitely better than DDR. He’s somewhere in between. Was the 15th-ish best player in the league for a long time. I think it’s strange people are surprised he has more all star appearances than Klay Thompson.
"&gt; I have to go out of my way to send articles and find stats and you throw it out the window with ""I don't like that answer, give better one"" and I find more stats and you say the same thing. Explain and give evidence, or don't come at all.   What stats? You haven't cited any stats to support your claim that you have 4 all star calliber players. I have given evidence. That only one of those players has actually made a team is a fact that I have provided. If they were all-star caliber, it's reasonable to expect them to have, you know, made the team. 0 All-nba is also a fact. I'm giving you facts, so stop complaining that I'm not.  &gt; Pacers v Cavs 2017. Only team to take LeBron to 7 in the first round. It got got decided by bad officiating, especially the awful goaltending decision.   Boy, I'm glad you brought this up. I think you mean 2018? 2017 you were swept by the cavs. But in 2018 Oladipo made an all-nba team and was playing at an elite level (as I mentioned above). It proves that if you give Nate McMillan elite talent, he can win some playoff games. Of course, Oladipo wasn't the same after his injury, which sucks.   &gt; Literally last year.   I meant top 4 roster talent, not seeding.   &gt; I could go back but that's not modern. It's hard to just fling out examples, because yet again, I have to spend time sifting through stats, articles, etc. as well as dealing with subjective opinions to satisfy you. Unless you expect me to know the history and players of every single franchise for the last 15 years or so off the top of my head, you can't keep demanding when you haven't given me anything back.   I thought this was a fairly straightforward point and the fact that you struggled to come up with examples off the top of your head, I think says something. But since you are asking, let's look at the past three years of second round teams and see how many had All-NBA selections:  2020  Bucks (Giannis), Raptors (Siakam), Heat (Butler), Celtics (Tatum), Lakers (Lebron, Davis), Nuggets (Jokic), Clippers (Kawhi), Rockets (Westbrook, Harden)  Kemba, PG, and Lowry have also been selected in previous years.   All 8 teams had an all-nba selection.  2019  Bucks (Giannis), Raptors (Kawhi), Celtics (Kyrie), Sixers (Embiid), Warriors (Curry, Durant), Blazers (Lillard), Rockets (Harden), Nuggets (Jokic)  Off the top of my head I believe Klay Thompson and CP3 have prior selections, and Ben Simmons would be selected the next year.  8/8 again.  2018  Cavs (Lebron), Raptors (DeRozan), Sixers (Embiid), Celtics (0!), Warriors (Durant, Curry), Rockets (Harden), Pelicans (Davis), Utah (0!).  So it was only 6/8 in 2018. But and this is big but in my opinion, Utah and Boston had future all-nba selections in Gobert and Tatum, also Mitchell seems inevitable at some point.   So, I think this shows that while certainly not impossible, it is extremely difficult (2 for 24 in the last three years) to make the second round without elite talent. Even in the 2 cases where teams advanced without it, they had future selections on the roster. Certainly possible that Indiana has a breakout from one of their guys in the years ahead, but I just don't think they've really shown enough yet to expect them to carry you to playoff wins against a team like Miami at least as of last year.  &gt; I don't think I came across like that, I just think that you've been exposed to a different philosophy and culture, and that's why you probably won't understand. You guys draft your way to victory, and this is what we're seeing again. Pacers have almost always made good trades and developed those players to All-Star level.   You called me spoiled. I just wrote you a long paragraph on how the Pacers can find elite players either in the middle of the draft or through trade and gave PG and Oladipo (even if it didn't last with him) as examples. Where exactly is my bias? ""Oh your team has had elite players, so of course you think that's needed."" Totally unfair given that I've just shown you three years of evidence (that was really easy to think through btw). I'm 100% not saying the Pacers are stuck in the middle or need to blow up or tank. I just think they have lacked elite talent on the roster outside of the 1 year of Oladipo over the McMillan era. So, it's absurd to point to his playoff performance and call him a regular season coach given this lack of top end talent. My argument is keep McMillan and keep after it and eventually you get that elite guy and boom yay you have a good coach.   And fine, if we're going there, you have a biased perspective because you are a PACERS FAN. You are so close to the topic. Gee do you think it's possible that as a fan, you might be overrating your players a bit? Of course. Of course you think ""if we just modernize the offense we will be an elite team in the East,"" because that's a more positive thought then the reality which is that you will probably be doing good to make the playoffs until you get or develop an elite player. I wasn't gonna go there, but evidently that's on the table."
So far: more Finals MVPs than Curry and double the All-NBA &amp; All-Star appearances of Klay Thompson.  What the fuck.

Klay Thompson: Big Smokey
this is like that Klay Thompson fouling out meme
The description of the post literally says “IS KLAY THOMPSON RETURNING TO THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS” he’s just dispelling that as a possibility
Warriors to sacrifice James Wiseman for healthy Klay Thompson
"&gt; Kind of sounds like what y'all need to be doing. Or getting another superstar?  yeah good news is next year we're getting this dude called Klay Thompson I hear he's pretty decent  &gt; You better be from San fran if you're repping the warriors still.  I'm gonna need some real strong justification for this one.  It was one thing getting called a bandwagoner during the championship years, but after a 15-win season last year and holding at .500 this year, why exactly am I only allowed to be a Warriors fan if I'm from San Francisco *now*?"
"Different year than the one they went back to back, and no lol, they were hurt all playoffs and in the Finals.   [https://www.sbnation.com/2019/6/14/18678630/warriors-injury-history-playoffs-nba-finals-2019-kevin-durant-klay-thompson-stephen-curry](https://www.sbnation.com/2019/6/14/18678630/warriors-injury-history-playoffs-nba-finals-2019-kevin-durant-klay-thompson-stephen-curry)  Klay, Boogie, Looney, Iggy and KD  Also you act as if them being down 3-1 without a Top 3 player in the world means they wouldn't have won with him. KD came back for 1 quarter as a sharpshooter and cooked Kawhi and the Raps. He played them in the regular season and had 51 in an OT win. If he plays the whole series even with all the other injuries, the Dubs win  Embiid never had to play anyone as good as that, and he still lost with a better team than AD's ever had in NOLA"
[The video clip of what Kerr is referring to.](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/steph-curry-comforts-klay-thompson-warriors-win-vs-nuggets).
"For make the greatest team to not make the finals I would add the 2015-16 OKC and 2016-17 Spurs. For OKC Klay Thompson was so hot in the series and playoffs as a whole. As well KD and Russ also played not the greatest a couple games which lost them the series. They were also 55-27 in the regular season, ie 3rd seed west and east of u swap records. For the Spurs kawhi got injured in the first game. The Spurs were leading the warriors by 23 points in the first game. And I would definitely argue that the Spurs would’ve won the series if kawhi wasn’t injured. It would’ve been a close series but the Spurs would’ve come out on top."
"Dude, Stockton was a sniper. Imagine if he'd been allowed to take as many threes as a Curry or a Klay Thompson."
Gotta take shot distance/difficulty into account. Consider guys like Klay Thompson who shoot &lt;15 shots over 30 feet in comparison to Lillard who had already shot ~100 shots over 30 this year.
1st he wouldn’t be as efficient ofc he’ll have more shot attempts. But u calling him a rim protecting Klay Thompson? KD was flat out a better scorer period Nd doing it with the defense keying in on him. Give young KD jokic he might have averaged 30 his 2nd year😂
"Listen y’all. Hear me out. Keep in mind I actually watch a lot of MPJ because I’m a nuggets fan. So if you don’t, don’t be so quick to judge.  I’ve also watched KD  basically all of his career. KD might be the most talented player I’ve ever seen, if I could build a perfect basketball player, it would be KD.   MPJ has the potential to be better than KD. Keyword is potential. A lot of this has to do with him learning in Denver’s system. Let’s look at a few things.   KD obviously had a better handle than MPJ at this point in his career, and as a result was a better playmaker. He was also a better free throw shooter and had better footwork so he was a better post player.   I’d argue that’s it. It took KD 3 seasons to average the rebounds MPJ is averaging now(7.6) and MPJ is averaging way less minutes than KD was averaging(31 to KDs 39). MPJ is also pretty inexperienced compared to KD in his 3rd season.   MPJ is a better shooter than KD is right now. KD is an elite 3pt shooter, especially for a 7 footer but MPJ is just one of the best in the league. (44% from 3)  MPJ is also a better shot blocker than KD was at this point and is becoming a solid defender, especially off ball. MPJ is more athletic than KD.   He’s also becoming a better off-ball  offensive player than KD as a result from playing with Jokic and in Denver’s system.  Basically right now MPJ is like a PF Rim Protecting Klay Thompson, but he’s only 22 and is inexperienced.  Once he adds a handle and footwork he’ll be virtually impossible to guard. This off-season will basically be his first real offseason to look at a lot of tape and work on his game. 18 PPG and 7.6 Rebounds on 54/44/77 in his second year on 31 MPG is no joke. Per 36 he’s averaging 21 and 9 and he’s not even having plays called for him like that.   Just imagine what he’ll be in 5-6 years..."
Asking someone to be your Klay Thompson is asking them to be the best defender on the floor while also being able to score 30 in 1 half without breaking a sweat lol.  We witnessed this dude save GS's season in 2016 wcf when he hit like 10 3s in a row against okc.  I'd be surprised if MPJ became half of what peak Klay was.
Duncan Robinson is a bum    Joe Harris is a Walmart Klay Thompson
I’d have to say Klay Thompson  Edit: also love watching Joe Ingles play. He looks like he should be playing a church ball game and here he is locking people up in the NBA
"So first of all this is straight-up false. Game 3 you had Curry (43min), Green (40), Iguodala (31), Cook (26), Bogut (21). Cousins also played more minutes than McKinnie.  I would still say Cavs are worse even with this fake info because Mozgov, Shumpert, and Thompson still started all 6 games, and Dellavedova started 5. The Warriors supporting cast was pretty bad at the end but they still got 5 games of Klay Thompson, and also Iguodala started all 6 games."
"Steph ""One Bad Injury Away"" Curry   Klay ""Two-Year Hiatus"" Thompson   Kristaps ""Working His Way Back"" Porzingis  That a nice Big Three for the Out-For-The-Season."
"Leave it to the lakers to give “washed players” there confidence back or scrub role players to shoot like Klay Thompson. Even though the Lakers aren’t winning, they are winning in giving people basketball spirit"
Just get Klay Thompson lol it’s not that hard
Ok so which Wizards player is turning into prime Klay Thompson tonight?
"Harden has had some very good teams as well. That 65 Rockets team was a championship level team that just got injured at the wrong time. Also worth mentioning that Kawhi had the series of his life in round 2 where he was getting next to no support scoring the ball.  Either way I just think Kawhi’s scoring is more consistent while Harden’s is more volatile. Kawhi can reach Harden’s highs while hitting his lows far less often.  &gt;If CP3 was healthy in 2018, the Rockets very likely win it all. Just CP3 alone... vs the best team of all time and Harden almost won it all. Meanwhile Kawhi was a no show vs a Warriors team with Quinn Cook and Jonas Jerebko getting significant minutes  This is a weird argument. You chose the two nobodies on a team with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. And like I said he was nowhere near a no show. 28.5 ppg on 60 TS% is right there with some of Harden’s best series Harden’s ever had."
I'll die on this hill that 4 years from now everyone will be wondering how Bouknight didn't go top 5 just like we've done for players like Paul George and Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson
It's between Chris Boucher  and  Klay Thompson
"Kobe Bryant,Devin Booker, Damian Lillard,Klay Thompson"
"This is what I keep telling Warriors fans. Feels like our front office is putting everything on next season too. Cause apparently Klay Thompson coming off an acl and Achilles injury is supposed to magically make us contenders again.   I want the FO to make moves. Whether it’s the Twolves pick, Wiseman, DPE. But they just calling this season a wash I guess."
He was shooting it like he was Klay Thompson in game 6
"Only 2nd to Klay ""This is a man's league"" Thompson blowing a 3-1 lead lol."
"So you’re currently a coach ignoring context? We always stats facts without context: It’s a fact Quinn Cook is better than Klay Thompson. He’s scoring more points, more assists and more 3’a. It doesn’t matter context, it’s a literal fact. See how funny that sounds?  How you gonna be a coach and not see the amazing attention Robinson provides from the defense?"
"What is he better at tho... Steph is so good at that, that teams will sell out double teams to stop him and give Kevin Fucking Durant or Klay 60 points on 9 dribbles Thompson open to do so lmao Kawhi is better built to bang in the midrange and fight his way to the bucket sure. Steph at his peak is a better shooter, better in the midrange, finishes better at the rim...  Just cuz Kawhi can muscle his way to the paint doesn’t necessarily make him better, Steph can get similar results with finesse and he can just bomb away in a way Kawhi could only dream"
Bro what? Do you bot understand how fan voting works? Fans are stupid and will vote for the same people every year. Fuck Klay Thompson was top 10 in the west guards without playing since 2019. Most popular does not mean best
Morris is literally klay Thompson
Klay Thompson would like a word
100 points in a single game would be breakable if players could get the minutes. Kobe's 81 point game he played 42 minutes. And he only scored 26 in the first half. If he'd played the first half like he did the second he'd have scored 110. Also Klay Thompson scored 60 in 29 minutes against the pacers and didn't play in the 4th quarter. 60 in 29 is on pace for 99 points over 48 minutes. I think there are players capable of getting the points. There just aren't coaches willing to give them the minutes they need to do it.
"...the warriors have all 3 of their centers out.  Oh also had Draymond Green out, who was playing center.  And did I forget Klay Thompson?"
"I can rewatch this a million times and still every time I read that headline “Thompson scores 37 in a quarter” I ask myself how the fuck is that even possible?  God mode that’s how! Get well soon, klay!  Basketball misses you"
also steph playmakes plenty   he has to be the point guard and also be klay thompson in that offense
"Why do people make this point? It says nothing. Of course they're not in a Game 7 without Kyrie. If the Warriors didn't have Klay Thompson, they wouldn't be in it either. See?"
Klay Thompson is an elite shooter but definitely not an elite scorer. By elite im defining it to roughly top 10 in the league in scoring
"Klay Thompson is basically a poor man’s Joe Harris  There, I fixed it."
he’s the brooklyn klay thompson
He's basically a Klay Thompson-lite.
Thank Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson is their biggest signee
"""And Klay Thompson for whatever reason.” Lmao this was hilarious espc with a warriors flair 😂"
"yeah, they were down to just Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodola"
"It reminds me of people criticizing Curry by saying ""Curry never gets criticized"".  The only top players in the league who don't get shit on are guys who haven't been in the league long enough (Doncic is starting to transition out of that phase) and Klay Thompson for whatever reason."
"Does Charles know who Jordan Clarkson is? I bet he has an image of Klay Thompson in his brain. ( I know Klay has not played, it's the joke)"

"[From a 2015 article:](https://247sports.com/college/kansas/board/103719/Contents/steph-curry-made-77-3-pointers-in-a-row-at-practice-71139492/)  &gt;the NBA regular season draws to a close, Stephen Curry might be just finding his best shooting stroke. The Golden State Warriors guard and owner of the NBA single-season 3-point record connected on 77 straight 3s in Tuesday's practice. Curry rotated around the perimeter, taking 10 shots from several spots. Curry told ESPN the 77 represents the most he's ever made in a row. Out of 100 shots taken during the session, he made 94. Teammate Klay Thompson, who is second in the NBA with 234 made 3s, told ESPN he couldn't believe Curry had made 77 straightand that his own record streak is 36.  I think we can use a little common sense here and say that Klay probably did not reach 100 in a row if 36 was his max in 2015, let alone the 300 or more that you recalled."

"Lol LeBron averaged 34/12/9 on 63.0% TS in the 2017 Finals and 34/9/10 on 62% TS in 2018. Cleveland's second best offensive player in the 2018 Finals was Kevin ""53.5% TS"" Love and his third was fucking JR Smith. Kevin Durant had Steph Curry and Klay Thompson.   LeBron's performances were infinitely more impressive, especially when you consider the colossal gulf between Cleveland and Golden State's defenses. It's not even close."
"Easy to do when you have the Steph Curry and Klay Thompson surrounding you instead of Kyrie Irving and Kevin ""39% from the field in 2017 and 32% from three in 2018"" Love"
"I wouldn't say Kawhi was seriously in the MVP discussion any of those years. Klay Thompson is in the top 10 for all star guard votes, so clearly there is some noise there."
"Embiid i agree is gonna go down as one of the great centers...but I think his archetype does exist. Big big men with impossible coordination and skill at that size? David Robinson, Hakeem and Malone could all play a similar game at center today, even shooting 3s if that was their focus at any point. Embiid is bigger than those guys but they’re faster.   Jokic and KAT are true unicorns, maybe a dirk in the present day could replicate KATs volume but i mean he’s a center with the same volume and percent last year as klay fckin Thompson"
klay thompson
"Yeah, he's been averaging Klay Thompson type numbers and the Blazers have won 7 straight.  Like, Dame-Trent Jr-RoCo-Jones Jr-Kanter makes for a strong and complimentary lineup that can shoot, rebound, defend the perimeter, facilitate, etc."
"Lavine just proves to us how impatient and unrealistic we are with draft expectations. Now people don't want to admit they were wrong for prematurely judging a prospect.  Lavine coming into the draft was a  high potential, very athletic, raw player with a body of a high schooler. He missed two years with injury and recovery. All while everyone had already judged him as a empty scorer.  He's matured more, his body is strong, and he has an actual coach. Is having a historic season.   We need to stop calling players busts after a season or two and actually let them develop. Kawhi, Curry, Butler, Klay Thompson, Hayward, Lowry, Middleton, etc .. all players who didn't make an all star until 25."

No Klay Thompson either! Crazy this team still pretty good with only that Curry guy
"pippen is a HOFer haha  it was good luck, good scouting, whatever ... that doesn't diminish Pippen at all.  He's still a HOFer.  Klay Thompson and Dray and Curry all ended up on the same team and went supernova at the same time.  That's how it works."
Klay Thompson and Ray Allen gotta be up there
"Fans are basically the same, players do something stupid and fans twist themselves into a pretzel to defend it, so which ones are most annoying depend on which player is doing the most silly stuff needing nonsense defending.  That being said, Klay thompson fans. He basically acts like an edgy teen and his fans jerk themselves over him smoking weed or something."
I mean we're coming off of 12 years of Thabo Sefalosha and Andre Roberson. Dort is basically Klay Thompson compared to what we had at the 2 guard for the life of this franchise.
"Eh, the Sixers traded away Moses Malone and the 1st pick in the draft away for garbage.  It would be like if the Warriors traded away the Wiseman pick and a healthy Klay Thompson for Kelly Oubre and then got mad at Curry for wanting out."
This is how it works though   Jordan Bell can’t get away with it because he’s Jordan Bell.   But Klay can because he’s Klay Thompson ...  Young players get hazed all the time but vets don’t. All about who you are and perspective.

Trent became Klay Thompson in the bubble and hasn’t looked back since
"Harris is ridiculous, white Klay Thompson out there"
Thats how how get shit like Klay Thompson getting more votes than kawhi. No thanks
"Lmao this take is only for people who started watching basketball in 2015. In 2013, Curry took a team w a core of 4 rookies and a sophomore Klay Thompson to the WCSF and doggone almost beat the Spurs by himself (same Spurs that was a miracle Ray Allen 3 away from the title). Curry took those Spurs to 6 w/ no other all stars. For reference, when Harden hasn’t taken his team further than Curry did in 2013 since the WCF in 2018... and he’s had CP3 and Westbrook as teammates"

"He averaged 13 and 6 in 2014. 14 and 7 for the entire playoffs. I don’t see how he was better then Draymond green in 2015 who was arguably a top 2 defender if not the best and most versatile defender in the league, or klay Thompson who was also a great defender and averaged 22 on 44% from deep"
"Want me to say Saddiq bays last 6 games, it makes him look like a godly version of klay Thompson   6 games isn’t a huge sample size lmao  And if Steven adams is so good on d and Zion leading u to a top 25 offence ever why u keep losing lmao"
Dwayne wade won finals mvp on his rookie deal. OG was a contributor for the raptors. Klay thompson and draymond green were both on rookie deals in 2014-15. Parker/manu both won on the spurs on their rookie deals.
Klay Thompson has always been an asshole.
i rather have prime klay over kyrie. now prime green+thompson blows a single kyrie out of the water.

Lol was Klay Thompson not on the team as well or am I missing something? The same guy who is a top 10 shooter of all time as well and who bailed you guys out against the Thunder before KD joined the next year
"Okay but neither of those things have anything to do with basketball. I personally think curry is the better all around basketball player and has a better leader mentality. In no way do I think James harden is bad. He’s one of the most offensively gifted players in the league. Curry is on a different level when it comes to 3 point shooting. I also believe curry is a better team player, not saying harden isn’t. They’re both amazing top tier talented players, and honestly arguing who is the better player is stupid. Steph curry had the blessing of playing all those seasons with one of the best 3 point shooters ever in klay Thompson, James harden never had a player by his side like that. Add on draymond green, and a handful of consistent role players who fit the system well, and you have one of the best teams in the league. Arguing Huston and Golden State were equal is going to come with bias, because it’s simply not true, the warriors were always the better team."
"Romeo is a much more natural playmaker and is a better off ball defender than Brown while only sacrificing a bit in athleticism. If you improve Romeos shooting to an elite level (a big and likely unrealistic ask) and he fills out his frame allowing him to progress into being a great on ball defender (to go along with him already being a better hustle/off ball defender) and all of his other skills develop well then absolutely he can have a higher ceiling than JB.  You gotta understand that ceiling is different than expected outcome. Andrew Wiggins has/had a higher ceiling than Klay Thompson, doesn’t mean that Wiggins was ever gonna be the better player. He just could’ve been if everything broke right."
Except when Oneale decided to be prime klay thompson late in the 4th.
Marcus Morris said I’m Klay Thompson today 😭
Watching him and klay Thompson shoot soothes the soul
I thought Jeremy Lamb would be a Klay Thompson like player and be a terrific third star in OKC when the Rockets traded him. Boy was I wrong. Overestimated his shooting ability and didn't consider how his body type lacked functional strength.  He looked awesome his freshman year at UCONN. So smooth.
"Drummond is also the best example for why PER is flawed as the be-all and end-all stat, especially for big men. Drummond has a higher career PER than: Stockton, Nash, Kidd, Wall, Iverson, Isiah Thomas(thats the Pistons one, but but applies to both anyways), Gary Payton, Reggie Miller,  Ginobili, Drexler, Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, Lowry, Beal and probably dozens more of great Guards who are clearly more valueable and better players."
2nd pick? If you aren't at least Klay Thompson level then gtfo
"Dame gets a lot of attention for being a small market star but definitely less than is deserved. Look at his all-star votes. Dude is 1st or 2nd team All-NBA nearly every year yet he never sniffs an all-star starting spot. Like, the year he got 1st team he got 1/3 the votes that Klay Thompson got. lmao"
"Yeah, the guy is actually averaging Klay Thompson type numbers.  20ppg on 47% 3pt as a starter."
"lol  there are players who are far more flagrant with it than Kawhi, for example Klay Thompson is an expert at it and so is JJ Redick. Altho Luka Doncic and especially Jason Tatum/Gordon Hayward, are the top experts at it."
"Yes, but they’re usually referenced separately from the regular season ones.   Steph is already first in playoff threes made, and has a sizable lead on second place, Lebron James. Klay Thompson is a few games way from passing Ray Allen for third."
"Hmm Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Lebron James and Andrew Bogut.   He should've joined the warriors in 2015"
"Malik Beasley, literally Klay Thompson but no all-star because t-wolves record is poo poo"
Robert Covington is possessed by Klay Thompson rn
Did I miss something? Why is Klay Thompson considered white now?
"best ability is availability. i’m currently better than Klay Thompson, don’t @ me."
&gt;who are some good white defenders??  Does Klay Thompson count?
"Klay Thompson, Rudy Gobert"
The guy is as white as Klay Thompson for one thing. He also is from a different country and doesn’t understand the nuance of race relations in the U.S.
"He fits right into the Hall of Very Good. Players their generation will never forget, but just do not have the resume for the real Hall of Fame. Marc Gasol, Derrick Rose, Shawn Kemp, Robert Horry, Manu (based on NBA only, he needs to get in based on international play).  I only want to see the very best role players get into the Hall, like Ben Wallace, Klay Thompson (his resume is actually kinda weak but he needs to be in), Rondo(?). NBA Hall needs to get a little more selective."
Did anyone ever hate klay Thompson? As unlikeable as the warriors became klay was always impossible for me to hate on
lmao this has 3 upvotes while the 1st quarter GSW highlights alongside Klay Thompson standing on the sidelines  are at the front page   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  fuck this sub.
"Klay ""Three Nut"" Thompson has a nice ring to it."
"ummm....  perhaps having Klay Thompson might have been useful for, you know, hitting threes?"
This game is missing Klay Thompson going subzero and raining threes.
The “he walked off on his own” thing is less comforting post-Klay Thompson
And Klay Thompson. You’re pretty much a HOFer at that point lol
Klay thompson
"Playing with steph curry and klay thompson. dray misses open layups on the regular, man. no way that team has even what resembles an offense let alone a good offense."
"When Klay Thompson says it to McGruder, it’s cool! When LeBron says it to Cam Payne, it’s bad!  FWIW i think both instances ere embarrassing for Klay and LeBron"
How is Dame on there for example? How is he in any way more significant to the game of basketball than Klay Thompson? He’s not. Dame has only 1 conference finals appearance while Klay has 3 rings. Dame is perennially a 6-8 seed bounced out of the first or second round. Klay spearhead the most unstoppable team in the history of basketball. Do they win even one ring without Klay?
"He is as good a shooter as anyone ever NOT named Steph Curry.  Its a debate... You can slice it up... Best shooter with variety... best catch and shoot... best in motion... best off the bounce... three levels... distance- deep range... but simply on PURE SHOOTING he's right there.  Reggie Miller Ray Allen Kevin Durant Larry Bird Klay Thompson  There's some style and flavor preferences no doubt when we argue, but the debate for 2nd best shooter EVER does include Klay Thompson."
"&gt;Any night I perform like Klay,  &gt;Cassius, Game 6 Thompson, Hammond, riduculous"
"At his best he was never even all star level. He was a good gunner off the bench. That is all. The man averaged 20 points ONE season, and that is his main skill.     That means he is below MJ, West, Harden, Wade, Kobe, Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Dave Thompson, Allen Iverson, T-Mac, Klay to name a few. Hell, he is miles worse than bloody Mitch Richmond. Give me a break."
That is true. Why was Klay Thompson complaining about not making it 😂
"I remember Klay Thompson and a few other guys leave the field after losing in 2016 lol, especially after saying that LeBron got his feelings hurt"
I prefer Klay-off Thompson
"Klay got the rings too, there is no way the Warriors win any championships in the 2010s without Klay Thompson. As an extremely crucial part of the most unstoppable team ever, he *has* to be on here."
Curry Thompson Bird  Lebron Hakeem  Klay is obviously the odd one but it would be so ridiculous to see that team
"I don't disagree, about the ability to wait.   Despite you or or I thinking it's wrong, doesn't change whether it's done or not currently.     With that said, I didn't really come into a thread about Klay Thompson to get into the minutia of cosmetic surgery for children.   So with that, I will bow out here."
"The first time I watched Danny Green was the 2013 Finals where he averaged 55% 3 point shooting on 7 attempts per game. People might not remember that cause the Heat won, but he was definitely on some Klay Thompson shit in that series"
"Reggie overrated because of his Knick performances.  He was not thought of as one of the best players in his prime as evidenced by his lack of All Star, All Team, and MVP shares. He was a great shooter and that was it.  Give me Klay Thompson any day"
There's no way Klay Thompson isn't better than these guys from the 1960s. I don't care how good they were against a bunch of tradesmen.
I’ve got Ginobli and Parker over Klay Thompson.  Klay is great but those two guys were in a dynasty that lasted decades.  TBH Klays dynasty lasted as long as a KD contract.  But if he feels otherwise he still has some years to prove it.  Otherwise Klay has as much claim as Chris Middleton or Kyle Lowry.
"[""But he's not a random role player. He's Klay Fuckin Thompson.""](https://i.imgur.com/0Fc0yKF.gif)"
Tony hasnt done [this](https://ca.nba.com/amp/news/six-times-golden-state-warriors-guard-klay-thompson-broke-basketball/1h98ejsgt1s5513e3ugzbphlb1) though so… 🤫
Sure but PG is the QB of the team and so 9/10 of ten times he leads! So Klay didnt need to for obvious reasons!   Meanwhile he has broken [NBA records](https://ca.nba.com/amp/news/six-times-golden-state-warriors-guard-klay-thompson-broke-basketball/1h98ejsgt1s5513e3ugzbphlb1) too!
Of course Dame is gonna get more voting coz he’s the point guard of the team and so stands out. Klay aint and didnt need to. Hell even Steph took a lesser role than he was used to when KD joined. Not for lack of skill or trying is my point.  Klay has broken records too for himself [here](https://ca.nba.com/amp/news/six-times-golden-state-warriors-guard-klay-thompson-broke-basketball/1h98ejsgt1s5513e3ugzbphlb1)!!  Stats not popularity contest through votes!
"He's probably Klay ""Squidward's House"" Thompson"
"Klay Thompson played the best 12 minutes of basketball that anyone has ever played, ever. I was there. It felt like a miracle. He does belong on that list."
"Show me what Dame has done!   Here’s Klay Thompson;  3× NBA champion (2015, 2017, 2018)  5× NBA All-Star (2015–2019)  2× All-NBA Third Team (2015, 2016) NBA All-Defensive Second Team (2019) NBA Three-Point Contest champion (2016) NBA All-Rookie First Team (2012)  2× First-team All-Pac-10 (2010, 2011)  HOF right there even if he retires today!"
"Melo was one of the best 3-Level Scorers and could make his own offense. Even though he was never an elite passer, the ability to create offense is part of playmaking.  Klay is an absolutely ridiculous shooter. And he is one of the best at off-ball movement of all time. However, his ability to create with the ball in his hands has always been lacking, and his [career stats](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/klay-thompson-stats-without-steph-curry) without Curry on the court are as well."
"For the record, I'd put Manu on the list before TP. He probably would have done better on annual awards if he wasn't sacrificing so much coming off the bench (and if he had some more years at the beginning of his career). So, no one's saying they're scrubs - that's an overreaction, this is a super exclusive club. Hell, this thread is about Klay Thompson (who's awesome) not making the list.  But, anyway, while not the GOAT, Duncan is one of the best players of all time and Pop is probably the greatest coach of all time, in my opinion."
"I love Dame but no!

"Klay is the second best shooter of all time.   Curry the best.   If Reggie Miller is on that list, Klay Thompson should be on that list.   And I LOVE Reggie Miller."
"3 times champion! What has Dame done?? You are the idiot here Sir! Lmao  How bout this; Google, “Klay Thompson NBA records”"
"Lol a few years ago Klay said that he grew up in a tough environment and had to go through so much to be a NBA player. The community flipped because the motherfuckers the son of a first overall pick player Mychal Thompson and literally was in the best situation imaginable to become a professional basketball player, compared to those players who grew up in violent streets under single-moms. I love Klay, but sometimes these guys think they hit a triple when in reality, they are just born on 3rd base. It's kinda embarrassing sometimes."
Ben Simmons makes Draymond look like Klay Thompson as a shooter
But he's not a random role player. He's Klay Fuckin Thompson.
If Damian Lillard is on that list than Klay Thompson for damn sure should be on that list
Lol what?  Lowry had some rough playoffs years sure but Thompson?  Did you not watch 2016 WCF Game 6?  Or 2019 NBA Finals Game 6?   In the playoffs Klay is averaging 19.3 points per game on 45% from the field and 41.5% from 3.  He scored 22 in his first ever playoff game as a second year player.  He held the record for most 3's made in a playoff game until Lillard broke it in these last playoffs.  How on earth is Klay a playoff choker?
Klay Thompson has an 80 million dollar contract with a Chinese shoe company.
&gt; Klay Thompson commutes to work in a 37-foot fishing boat.  No banana for scale.
I guess this means Klay thompson is better than Charles Barkley.
ummmmmmmm didn't you know Klay thompson without Steph put JAMES HARDEN away in 5 GAMES as the number 1 option? stop spouting opinions when you don't actually watch the player you wanna have an opinion on
gotta love how nonsensical yet informative Klay Thompson articles are
So the difference between last years team and all previous warriors team was simply klay Thompson?
"Klay is an above average defender and one of the most efficient shooters in NBA history. I don't think anyone says Klay is a ""historically"" good defender.    But how many guards that made the all defensive list this past decade would you elect to sign over Klay Thompson?  A list that's basically voted on by reporters who read player stat sheets and vote based on blocks and steals.  Chris Paul sure...arguably Jrue Holiday or Jimmy Butler..  But how about Matisse Thybulle?  Tony Allen?  Patrick Beverley?  Eric Bledsoe?  How about Ben ""Lebron 2.0"" Simmons who defers a layup in the playoffs?  You want Oladipo or Roberson instead?  John Wall?!?  And how is John Stockton a 3 &amp; D player at all?  A 38% 3fg shooter that averaged less than 2 attempts per game compared to Klays 42% on 7 attempts per game?"
I’d argue Klay is one of the greatest shooters in NBA history. At least top 5. Throw that in with may championships and some lock down defense along the way. Imo some of the players on the original 50 don’t belong there. Like people really think Dolph Schayes is better than Klay Thompson ?
Klay Thompson would get injured every single year if he played in the 80s and 90s. A personal foul would end his season.
"So once someone breaks that, Klay Thompson is out right? That's how your argument works sooo"
Nobody: “Why isn’t Klay Thompson on this list??”  Klay Thompson: “Why isn’t Klay Thompson on this list??”
"Why not Klay?   Are you really going to act like you can’t see the difference between LeBron, who has very actively spoken out against NBA voices that were critical of the Chinese government, and Klay Thompson, who has very actively spoken out about his boat?"
"&gt; Psycho, I'm liable to go ~~Michael~~ *Thompson*, take your pick  &gt; Lea, Kenan, Klay - game 6."
Has Klay Thompson ever averaged 3 assists per game?
"How did Klay Thompson not make it? 3x champ, perennial all star, one of the best wing defenders in the league and top 3 shooter or all time. Crazy"
PG: Stephen Curry (37)  SG: Klay Thompson (35)  SF: Lebron James (40)  PF: Draymond Green (35)  C: Brook Lopez (37)  Brook looks like the best C who will be old and washed just in time to join this super team.  Who would the bench be?
Klay Thompson confirmed to be low-potassium.
"&gt; Klay has an argument for greatest 3 and D player ever, in any era.   Well ""3&amp;D"" has only been a thing in the modern era.    But no - this is not true anyway.  Because lots of stars are great defenders and 3-point shooters but do so much more that they transcend the 3&amp;D label.  Kawhi, Durant, Chris Paul, John Stockton, etc are all far better 3&amp;D guys than Klay Thompson - just nobody thinks of them that way because they bring a lot more value to the table.  And this is why Klay doesn't sniff the Top 75 - he doesn't do a lot else besides 3&amp;D.  Also - people in this sub act like Klay is some kind of historically good defender.  He's not.  He made *one* All-Defense team in his career.  Like for fuck's sake - there are guys with double digit All-Defense teams and dozens with 5+.  Klay made one.  Klay is a good defender and great 3-point shooter."
"Seriously.  You're the 2nd/3rd (maybe even 4th) best player on a great team whose career best line is a 22/4/2.  Tons of Klay Thompson type guys didn't make the list.  There's no shame in not making that list, and nobody should really expect it.  And what kills me about Klay whining is I wouldn't even put him in the Top 100.  Plenty of other guys I'd put in the list before Klay."
"There are bigger snubs than Klay Thompson.  Would he even make the top 10 snubs list?  He doesn’t have the career totals, all stars and all NBA’s to make the list.  He has 12,000 points and a career average of 19.5/3.5/2.5. He just isn’t one of the top 75 players of all time."
Klay Thompson is starting a no-bananas boat crew.
"Really Strange how they left of dikembe, Dwight, Tony Parker, and pau gasol off to me personally. They were all a huge part of multiple deep playoff runs and have extensive resumes. And Klay Thompson being left off is also a pretty bad look to but more understandable.   Really Wish they had taken off a few older guys. Like Nate Thurmond, Pete Maravich, and some of those 70s Knicks players who were role players on the championship team…"
"Manu was a great player no doubt, but he was the 3rd option on a dominant for most (all?) of his career. It was easier for him to make the right play than it was for T-Mac to do so when he had to carry bad teams.  Those 11, plus T-Mac, Earl Monroe, Sidney Moncrief, and Sam Jones is who I have over Manu. Then Carter, Klay, Dumars, David Thompson, Hal Greer, Alvin Robertson, Reggie Mitch Richmond and Bill Sharman make up the next tier with Manu. So anywhere from 16-26 I could see Manu.  I just can't fathom putting a player who was never a top 10 player inside the top 15 at his position all time."
"I think Ginobili is a T15 SG.   Jordan, Kobe, West, Wade, Harden, Miller, Drexler, Iverson, Allen, Maravich, Gervin.  That’s 11 names I’d take over Manu.  Then, you’re in the Klay Thompson, Vince Carter, Joe Dumars tier of SGs and I think Ginobili has an argument against almost anyone in that tier in terms of on-court impact. His 2005 run, from beginning to end, was insane and throughout his career, he was basically the king of “making the right play.”"
"Yes it's a shocker that an MVP, 2x scoring champ, 9x All NBA, 9x All Star dude made the list over Klay Thompson lol."
KLAY THOMPSON WAS LEFT OFF
Klay Thompson is a middle class (not quite a poor man's) Reggie Miller
"It's really not, Dame SMOKES Klay statistically:  |Rk|Player|From|To|G|GS|MP|FG|FGA|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|2P|2PA|2P%|eFG%|FT|FTA|FT%|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Damian Lillard|2013|2022|683|683|36.3|8.1|18.4|.438|3.0|8.0|.374|5.1|10.4|.488|.520|5.5|6.2|.893|0.6|3.6|4.2|6.6|1.0|0.3|2.8|2.0|24.6| |2|Klay Thompson|2012|2019|615|578|33.1|7.3|16.0|.459|2.9|7.0|.419|4.4|9.0|.491|.551|1.9|2.3|.848|0.4|3.0|3.5|2.3|0.9|0.5|1.7|2.1|19.5|  Then he has the PER, TS%, Win Shares, Box Plus/Minus, VORP, Net Rating etc.  Dame has an All-Star appearance more, 4 more All-NBA appearances and a ROY over Klay whereas Klay exceeds Dame defensively with an All Def nod.  Then you want to discuss impact on the game which is highly hypothetical but Dame is an all-time great shooter, he is one of the best (maybe all-time best I can't find the stat) from 30ft. Dame has had historic moments as well. 3 60 point games, two game-winning buzzer beaters in the playoffs.  Klay has the championships sure, many could argue as the 3rd or 4th most important player of those teams depending on how you value Draymond but I'm not gonna knock Dame down for sticking with Portland, not lucking into having a generation talent grow next to him as Curry and another ring chasing one in Durant joining him.  Klay's a very good NBA player, not an all-time great. Not to be taken as Gods word but Basketball Reference's Hall of Fame Probability calculator has Dame at 91% and Klay is down at 50%.  All in all, Dame is a better player and more deserving based on individual success and talent."
"2016 Steph Curry (transcendent 3pt shooting, off-ball gravity)  1989 Michael Jordan (point guard experiment MJ, triple double threat)  2016 Klay Thompson (elite 3pt shooting, high level perimeter defender)  2013 LeBron James (the do-it-all Swiss army knife, elite defense &amp; playmaking)  2004 Kevin Garnett (dominant defense, high post playmaking)  Splash Bros because 3pt point shooting is meta af. Oh yeah and spacing, a lot of it  MJ is well, MJ, he gets buckets.  2013 LeBron was a fearsome defender, fully engaged he could shutdown guards on the perimeter then stuff your big man at the rim on the next possession. Even shot 40% from 3pt range albeit on rather low volume.  Kevin Garnett because he's like a 1-man wrecking crew on defense. He can switch, he can stuff you at the rim, he can rip the ball from you and go coast-to-coast himself. On offense he can handle the ball a bit, create for others as well as hitting his signature post fadeaway."
"Klay Thompson should have been in the top 75 too. 3 time champion, lockdown defender, one of the best shooters ever"
"You've at least got the entire picture to work with and your comparing apples with apples with KB/TD and Cous/Mikan comparison   Klay Thompson being snubbed is gonna look really really stupid in a few seasons time barring injury, his scoring is historically significant and he would be top 65 barring that horrible injury streak"
"If Dennis Rodman made it, why not Klay Thompson as well?"
This is the worst take I’ve ever heard from klay Thompson
hey wasnt klay thompson supposed to be healed by now? where is that dewd?
What about Pau Gasol or Klay Thompson?
"Is this satire, or are you really saying Klay freaking Thompson would make an all-time starting 5?  Klay is amazing, but come on man. Klay wouldn't even make a third team all-time starting 5. What is this nonsense."
Rodman did that as a 6'7 PF in an era where people were still running twin tower lineups at PF/C  And OP out here tryna tell us Rodman (especially considering his accolades) ain't one of the 75 greatest players but Klay fucking Thompson is?
What about Klay Thompson with an even hotter hand though
" Klay Thompson is a 5x All-Star, 3x champion, and a 2x All-NBA player. He's had a great career but there's no way it tops Cousy, who is a 13x all-star, 12x all-nba, 6x champion, and won the mvp in 1957.  Sam Jones is more comparable to Klay, but he's won 10x championships, 5x all-stars, and 3x all-nbas, which beats him in every category. Bill Sharman is a 8x champion, 8x all-star, and 7x all-nba player, which also is more than Klay has in any category. All three of those players achieved more in their careers than Klay has."
And to think this is Warriors WITHOUT Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson dressed like Marty McFLy
"He's really underrated because his box score numbers look pedestrian and he didn't really have a great supporting cast.  He's insanely efficient (especially after adjustment for league efficiency), constantly elevated his game in the playoffs, and has really really good offensive impact metrics despite his lack of ball-dominance. His combination of scoring + efficiency is matched by very few players in league history. Check his TS add.  If you think Klay Thompson is a good approximate of his value, you'd be wrong, their impact metrics aren't even close. He has 13 seasons above Klay Thompson's career high in efficiency."
"The Kyrie hate is ridiculous at this point. How is the greatest ankle taker not included? All star, champion, clutch performer, I mean come on. How is Klay Thompson not included? How is tmac not included? The list is a joke"
Klay Thompson?
I don’t think you can do better then Klay Thompson. Like he’s so perfect for LeBron plays defense and he’d be the best shooter he’s played with maybe besides Kyle Korver
Off topic but imagine saying klay thompson is your 3rd option (before injury obv)
This fucking team is going to add Klay Thompson at some point.  That’s crazy
Fuck it ima say it.   Reggie Miller walked so Ray Allen / Steph Curry / Klay Thompson could run.   The guy redefined the 3 point line.
No one at that list could do what Klay Thompson does. How the other half of the greatest backcourt in NBA history doesn't make the list is a joke.
"If expanding to 100, here are some other deserving guys or guys on the bubble (in no particular order) :  \- Vince Carter  \- Dwight Howard  \- Tracy McGrady  \- Bernard King  \- Alex English  \- Joe Dumars  \- Chris Mullin  \- Kyrie Irving  \- Tony Parker  \- Manu Ginobili  \- Grant Hill  \- Yao Ming  \- Dikembe Mutombo  \- Chauncey Billups  \- Kyle Lowry  \- Shawn Kemp  \- Jack Sikma  \- Chris Webber  \- Connie Hawkins  \- Ben Wallace  \- Rasheed Wallace  \- Jo Jo White  \- Arvydas Sabonis  \- Klay Thompson  \- Bob Lanier  \- Dan Issel  \- Pau Gasol  \- Marc Gasol  \- Chris Bosh  \- Artis Gilmore  \- Adrian Dantley  \- Tom Chambers?  \- KC Jones  \- Tommy Heinsohn  \- Ralph Sampson  \- Mitch Richmond  \- Tim Hardaway  \- Sidney Moncrief?  \- Drazen Petrovic"
"Well if you were thinking klay, I have some more reasons to think klay:  [Klay Thompson Is The Most “Advantageous” Player](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qccf0h/klay_thompson_is_the_most_advantageous_player/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  Although it’s arguable he’s a superstar, so maybe someone like Cj McCollum?"
"The problem with these kinds of lists is the lack of clarity on how it's compiled. Is it a list of the top 75 most accomplished? Or most talented and skilled? Individual success? Klay Thompson is without a doubt one of the 5 greatest shooters in the history of the game, and he's had multiple rings. Does that qualify him? IMO, yes, but again, what's the criteria?"
"My dude Klay Thompson scored 37 points in a fucking quarter, is a 3x champion, 5x all-star, and was a crucial piece in one of the greatest teams of all time."
"Finals MVP is most overrated individual award in the NBA.   Cedric Maxwell has finals MVP. Guess who were his teammates?  Nate Archibald, Larry Bird, Robert Parish, Kevin McHale.   Klay Thompson has missed the last two season and still has scored more points in the NBA than Kawhi Leonard. Both guys are from 2011 draft class"
"I don’t really get this take, MPJ isn’t asked to do these kinds of things in the  Nuggets offense. It’s like asking Klay Thompson to be more of a distributor."
"It’s a common rule in these big money contracts across all sports, nfl just had the most recent example I could think of. They wouldn’t pay him if he got hurt skiing, why would it be any different for any other reason?   &gt; The warriors still had to play klay Thompson for getting injured during an offseason workout  Pretty sure that was team sanctioned, which would be completely different. Bless your heart though."
Yes it does. You’re trying to use the nfls dumb rule to say the sixers don’t have to pay Ben if he got hurt in the offseason. That’s not true. The warriors still had to play klay Thompson for getting injured during an offseason workout
"Definitely underrating him and his foot speed. Lamelo is never going to give you highlight defensive plays, but he is smart, long, and has good lateral speed as well as great team/help defense instincts. If he can get stronger and improve his instincts/skills, his ceiling is Klay Thompson. Kid can really be a superstar if he puts it al together."
He is more Klay Thompson than curry. Curry shoots a lot of the dribble mpj is still working on that part of his game
Klay Thompson has always been more of a catch and shoot player though.
he really is a taller Klay Thompson. Defense is getting better too.
"He’s coming back in January/February though. I liken it to Klay Thompson and the Warriors. Everyone talking how good they’ll be with Thompson back, but forget Murray will be back."
"I know this doesn't satisfy the conspiracy theorist in every r/nba nerd but it's probably because repeat MVPs need to put up improved personal and team stats, and it was hard to envision a team record improvement with his running mate out for the entire season. But now that MPJ is playing like a taller Klay Thompson- fewer dribbles, more shooting and more defensive engagement, and Gordon is playing like discount Draymond- doing    all the little things splendidly well; it's easier to imagine the Nuggets as a top 3 seed that brings Jokic the MVP again."
"1. Russell Westbrook finals MVP and Bill Simmons never says the words ""4 rounds"" and Russ in the same sentence ever again 2. The Celtics to finish just below the play in tournament 3. Ja Morant to make the second round by dunking ON EVERYONE ALL THE TIME 4. LET DONOVAN MITCHELL BE FREE FROM UTAH 5. Ben Simmons trade 6. Klay Thompson to catch fire for a few quarters 7. A Nets-Lakers finals with Vaccinated Kyrie on the floor"
"locks...   Giannis, Durant, Kobe, Wade, Nowitzki, Nash, Lebron, Kidd, Curry, Duncan, KG, AI, CP3, Reggie Miller, Gary Payton, Bob McAdoo, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard  decent chance but might not make it  Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Carmelo Anthony, Klay Thompson, Adrien Dantley, Tmac, Grant Hill, Chris Webber, Chris Bosh, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Kyle Lowry, Amare Stoudemire, Dominique Wilkins, Draymond Green   No shot but should get considered  Ben Wallace, Chauncey Billups, Yao Ming, Ron Artest, Pau Gasol, Paul George, Joe Dumars, Shawn Kemp, Alonzo Mourning, Grant Hill, Penny Hardaway, Derrick Rose  Should just fall off the list  Pete Maravich, Dave Bing, Lenny Wilkens, Hal Greer, George Gervin, Jerry Lucas, Robert Parrish, Nate Thurmond, Tiny Archibald"
"The lakers were lucky they played a Suns team where Chris Paul got hurt. If we’re lucky Murray got a season ending injury, are we also lucky Klay Thompson got a season ending injury? Were the bucks lucky Kyrie Irving and James Harden got injured? These are excuses"
"Lol, you're so focused on trying to be ""right"" that you lose all sense of objectivity with the last (grossly incorrect) sentence.   The two players are very much alike as basketball players in many MANY ways as I accurately described above multiple times, but you choose to dismiss facts because their personalities are different. You go ahead and be you, but ignoring the obvious doesn't make your points persuasive at all.  And to your latest point about Draymond's vocal role on the Warriors compared to Simmons quiet-as-a-mouse personality, I agree.... the two players are vastly different in that respect. To that I say this: so what?  Are you really trying to convince us that the other leaders on the team in coach Kerr, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson need Draymond to hold their hands and guide them to a championship? Seriously? The team will be just fine moving on without Draymond's veteran leadership at this stage.   I'm not saying his ""communication skill set"" didn't help along the way, but his aggressive personality definitely hurt them in several respects as well (arguing with the coach to the point, cursing out Durant, getting suspended in the Finals for techs, etc.).  Replicating most of what Draymond does APART from his personalty style is what you get from Simmons, and the vets on the team can help develop what he is lacking."
Where's the salt? I saw the literal dumbest combo of players you could pick on that list and I responded out of sheer amazement that someone would pass on literal MVP's and 1st ballot hall of famers for a defender that makes Simmons look like MJ on the offensive end and Klay Thompson. For real that's a straight up terrible pick of players compared to what's available and it wasn't done ironically. Sorry I didn't respect your safe space. Maybe you could've made it to the second round in the year 2000 with those two lol.
"For player five, I was like, that sounds like a &gt;!Klay Thompson!&lt; thing, and then as soon as I clicked it I was like, never mind, that makes sense. Lol. I was close, picking his teammate and all."
"Did you really just say Orlando didn’t waste talent? Lmao. Houston had an MVP didn’t win a chip, San Antonio had the goat coach/PF golden state had two mvps, a dpoy and klay Thompson. Denver has an MVP as well. Cp3 choked on the clippers and Zion is a young guy who isn’t yet as good as everyone thinks he is. Your take is bad."
This feels exactly like the Kevin Love for Klay Thompson + Draymond Green speculation way back when Love wanted out from Minnesota  People underrate the Hawks assets because they haven't gotten their chance yet and think the Hawks need to make a move to get to the next level. They just need to keep the core together as best they can.
MAYBE another championship? Does Klay Thompson not care about winning!?
"Hear me out, thomas muller and klay thompson. Both offball players, both the sidekick of a superstar. neither are really considered as a superstar but you wouldn’t be surprised to see them dominate big games either. Think both love to joke around their team too."
"The funniest thing is the retrospective narrative around The Warriors to undermine their achievements.  The constant complaints around being a ""stacked team"" to ""got lucky with injuries"" but before 2015 the stacked Warriors were made up of:  Steph Curry who was considered too small, too frail, too unathletic and an ankle injury away from being shipped out of the league  Klay Thompson who was considered a role-playing spot-up shooter at best (Marco Bellineli comparisons) because of his athletic limitations  Draymond Green who was considered a tweener with no true position and a high probability of fading out of the league  Andre Iguodala who was celebrated as a versatile two-way swingman but also heavily criticized in his Sixers days as being too passive and not a championship calibre SG  Andrew Bogut who was considered an unfortunate draft bust due to his injuries  And a collective of uncelebrated veteran journeymen like Shaun Livingston, Leandro Barbosa and Ian Clarkson"
"Kyrie is going to become an activist.  LeBron is going to be a GM, business mogul, actor, producer  The real question is, WHO BECOMES A SHOW HOST?!  How great would it be if Kahwai was a host.  Imagine him with Klay Thompson or Jimmy Butler or Steven Adams just shooting the shit on an NBA show."
Is the league jealous of us because they don’t have a Klay Thompson on their team.
"I'm gonna say MPJ. Perhaps i'm just cynical, but I really struggle to think that last season is truly the beginning of his growth (meaning he'll only go up from here). If he continues to do what he did last year he would literally be the best shooter in the history of the NBA. I struggle to believe that's sustainable. Secondly, he can't really create for himself, and I don't see that changing significantly. And lastly, he was soooo bad on defense in the playoffs. It could be injury but we know he has preexisting injury concerns and besides that is a bad defender. So he's like a super Klay thompson (lethal spot up shooter), but can't play defense at all and is likely to get injured regularly. I would always worry about him holding up in the playoffs against the best teams. But he could always end up proving me wrong! :)"
"Klay ""THE FISHERMAN"" Thompson   Chuck had it right"
When he crossed up Klay Thompson   https://youtu.be/loTuaeFtuE8
Huerter could legit be klay Thompson lite and dort could be juiced up Andre Roberson so it's hard.
"The 3pt contest trophy will probably get named after Steph Curry at some point, so there’s that.   Lebron will likely become a part owner of a team.    Draymond, KD, Embiid, Kyrie, and Harden will likely become media personalities.    CP3, Iguodala, Butler, Kawhi, Giannis, Jokic, and Rondo will probably have some coaching offers.  Klay Thompson will likely take a Hakeem/KG role, being brought in to teach players how to shoot considering his picture perfect form."
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
The shooters would have to be Steph Curry and Klay Thompson.
If it's in the last minute of the 4th quarter in the playoffs for a game winner; I can understand not wanting Steph who's 0-10 in those situations to take the shot. What I don't get is why Klay Thompson wouldn't be the choice instead of Iguodala.
&gt;I'm guessing when it's the Finals you can't just chuck up 3's and need to play the game more seriously even if you got the two best shooters.  * Most career 3-pointers in the Finals: Stephen Curry * Most 3-pointers in a Finals game: Stephen Curry * Most 3-pointers in a Finals series: Stephen Curry * Highest 3PM per game in a Finals series: Stephen Curry * Highest 3PT% in a Finals series with at least 5 3PA per game: Klay Thompson * Highest 3PT% in a Finals series with at least 10 3PA per game: Stephen Curry * Highest TS% with at least 25+ PPG: Klay Thompson  Your argument doesn't add up lol.
Draymond is a better playmaker sure but they playmake in the same ways.  Is Klay Thompson a bad scorer because he uses screens?
"I'm taking your argument to be that he's not a good playmaker because he has low assist numbers and his teammates are not making shots?  But it's not like he's being given Klay Thompson or Kyle Korver and making them shoot 35% from 3. Minnesota has had legitimately bad shooters throughout KAT's time on the roster. Just because someone is a constant doesn't mean they're the problem, is my point. See: Devin Booker."
Good thing klay played majority of the series and averaged 28 on ridiculous shooting percentages lol.   Imagine if bron had that in 2015 against a 67 win team instead of mozgov 14ppg.  Not to mention draymond averaging a near triple double with elite defense and iggy coming in clutch.   Imagine thinking warriors having klay/dray/iggy is the same as mozgov/Thompson/delly lmao. Stop trolling
GSW: What do you want for Ben Simmons?  76ers: Steph Curry and 3 unprotected first-round picks  GSW: How about we also send Klay Thompson and Draymond Green  76ers: Fair Enough  GSW: I am sorry you didn't get the joke. STOP CALLING!!!
"2019 was not against the GOAT team as we had shit depth and KD missed the entire series. Steph hard carried, while Dame played badly.  2019 against the Nuggets, he mostly gets flamed for his atrocious performance in a crucial Game 7. He gets off easier because they still won, but it was CJ that carried them to the win.  And the problem in 2016 is that in the first three games where Curry was out, the Blazers managed to only win one game, while Dame got outplayed by Klay Thompson.  2017 is the only one of these that I think is just fine."
"He was trash against both the Warriors and the Nuggets in 2019 dude. Got massively outplayed by Curry in 2019 (Durant missed the entire series, Steph hard carried). In Game 7 against Denver, he out up a spectacular statline of 13/10/8 on 3/17 shooting. Got completely outplayed by both Jokic and his own teammate CJ. Got outplayed by Klay Thompson and only managed to win 1 game against the Warriors in 2016 despite Curry being out the first three games. The only one on that list where he wasn't disappointing was 2017, and even then, his efficiency plummeted like it tends to in the postseason."
Klay Thompson with more dribbling
Is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbbDiltl-Hc) the one you mean for Klay Thompson?
"I didn't really watch Peja but the way people describe him, is Klay Thompson a ridiculous comparison?"
"I mean you don't think Klay Thompson, or the Curry bros, or Austin Rivers grew up rich?      While I do think Simmons has shown a general lack of accountability that his upbringing may have contributed to, I'm not sure if it's solely based on that. There's been plenty of other basketball players who have had his same general attitude who came from poor backgrounds as well."
White Klay Thompson
"&gt; Probably an overpay purely on the numbers, 23mil for just a rim roller and paint protector is pretty bad on paper.   This dude singlehandedly changed our defense from nearly dead last to average/slightly above average. And that's with Trae in the starting lineup. ""Just a rim roller and paint protector"" is SUCH gross oversimplification of what he does. He's right outside the top tier list of centers. That's like saying ""all Klay Thompson does is shoot"". Yeah, and you'd still want him cuz he's elite."
He's not Klay Thompson
"The difference between Kyrie and Curry is less about their skill set than it is about their understanding of and approach to the game.   With respect to handles... I mean ultimately, who give a fuck.   Handles might make for some interesting highlights, but if a guy like Stockton can get around a guy with subtle head fakes and stutter dribbles why put on the show to get the same things done at a lower rate of efficiency?   But that said.. Curry has AMAZING handles. When Mark Jackson was coach, we saw Curry's handles because Jackson ran more iso plays. And Curry handles are among the best I've seen.   So, in terms of 'skill,' the biggest advantage that Kyrie has is the handles, and they are (1) moot and (2) not that different.   Shooting IS a skill, and there is clearly NOBODY outside of Klay Thompson who rivals Curry in that area.   Passing is another skills, and Curry tops Kyrie there too, though I'm happy to call that a wash. They can both pass the rock, and have comparable career averages and A2T ratios. The difference is that Curry is doing it in a system where everybody shares the ball and makes passes, so a lot of Curry's passes that lead to a point is an assist that leads to an assist.   &amp;#x200B;  But where they differ is their understanding of and approach to the game.   I've never seen a guy like Curry, a franchise player, work so hard away from the ball. He's constantly in motion and setting picks for teammates. That's something Curry simply doesn't do, and when he does, he doesn't do it as well. Kyrie is looking for his own shot first, and then looking for open guys.   Curry is not only looking for the best shot on the floor, but it working to create it for other guys, even when he doesn't have the ball in his hands.   &amp;#x200B;  Curry sees basketball as a team sport and plays accordingly. Kyrie see it as a game of collective individual efforts and plays in that way.   So, sure... Kyrie breaks more ankles, but Curry scores and wins more.   Had Curry and Kyrie traded places for those three years where the Kyrie and the Cavs and Curry and the Warriors met up, it would have been 3-0 Cavs.   I think that tells you all you need to know about the debate."
That’s like saying the asking price is Kevon Looney or Klay Thompson
"Light skinned 5'11 Van vleet is loved. 6'3 jamal murray is loved. 6'5 light skinned Devin Booker who also grew up well off is loved. Klay Thompson who also grew up rich is loved.   As far as his size is concerned he is league average ""at worst"" for his size. Chris Paul is 6'0. Just stop"
"&gt;Obviously Steph, takes more contested shots than Klay since he takes shots off the dribble.  First of all, that's not true. Well, it is at face value since you're right that Steph takes more contested 3PA. But that's why were using relative percentages.   Year	|	Player	|	% of 3PA contested ---|---|--- 2014-2015	|	Curry	|	60% 2014-2015	|	Thompson	|	65% 2015-2016	|	Curry	|	69% 2015-2016	|	Thompson	|	60% 2016-2017	|	Curry	|	61% 2016-2017	|	Thompson	|	56% 2017-2018	|	Curry	|	58% 2017-2018	|	Thompson	|	63% 2018-2019	|	Curry	|	66% 2018-2019	|	Thompson	|	71%  Results:  * 2014-2015: Klay by 5%  * 2015-2016: Curry by 9%  * 2016-2017: Curry by 5%  * 2017-2018: Klay by 5%  * 2018-2019: Klay by 5%  &gt;Klay gets more open shots because he comes off screens or takes open 3s when the defense collapses on Steph/Draymond.  Second of all, Embiid is a 7-0, 280lb center.. He's not losing defenders by coming off screens.   Defenders would rather Embiid try to beat them at the 3-point line than in the paint."
"Nah I don't mind him taking 3s, just don't think you're Klay Thompson and take about 2-3 per game"
"&gt;Others, however, believe having two non-shooters on the court is too crippling for an offense, even with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, to overcome, particularly in the postseason.  This is the correct assessment"
Pat Bev Ben Simmy bad  Klay Thompson wholesome
"It’s a question mark. Ppl said the same thing about Paul George who maybe wasn’t 2 years but plays a way more explode type of game. Same goes for KD. Medical advancements have been insane as of late and things that we thought were impossible have come true. Until we see Klay Thompson play, they are not livers of past glory. You’re the one assuming and jumping the gun. We have no idea how Klay will come back but even if he’s 80% of what he used to be, warriors are scary. They’re no lottery team like the lakers were if that happens"
"Bc in the 2 years that they missed the playoffs. Their second best player, Klay Thompson missed both years. Their best player, curry missed virtually a full season. And their third best player, Draymond played very little during that one season. This upcoming season is the first time the core 3 will be playing together since being in the finals. Totally different scenario"
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.  (IN NO ORDER)  Lebron James  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Damian Lillard  Steph Curry  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Trae Young  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Jrue Holliday  Jamal Murray  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jimmy Butler  Zach Lavine  Luka Doncic  Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal"
"&gt; kd was doubled out of the playoffs repeatedly till he joined GS.  Career averages of 29/8/4 on 57% TS in the playoffs with OKC is hardly ""doubled out of the playoffs repeatedly"". He lost to great teams that were better than his (Heatles, 2014 Spurs, 2016 Warriors), simple.  &gt; double KD and take him out the game  You don't take KD out of the game, in OKC he had 7 games under 20 points in the playoffs in seven years, the way you play KD is you play hard nosed defense and hope he misses. The Thunder lost to all-time great squads and had horrible shooting all those years, they didn't lose because KD was taken off those games, that's impossible to do.  &gt; at GS though, the entire league decided the more dangerous player was steph and decided to never leave him all the way through to the finals for multiple years on end  No, the league decided that they could actually do something to contain Steph and that they didn't have an answer for Kevin Durant with shooters.  What yall don't understand is that doubling KD to force a pass to Andre Roberson and Russell Westbrook in the 3-PT line is one thing, another thing entirely is when he passes to Klay Thompson. KD is a good enough passer that he will find the open man when doubled, the problem was that in OKC the open man shot under 25% from 3 so he had to force bad shots, which hurt his efficiency."
cj mccollum can get hot randomly. he can put up a 30 ball when he wants. klay thompson can put up ridiculous scoring games. does that mean that dame and steph aren’t the #1 options?  kd is better. he gets the best defender put on him.
Klay Thompson as the first answer got me worried that all of the answers were going to be Klay Thompson. lol
Tacko Fall and Klay Thompson.   A literally unguardable 3 point toaster oven.
and that's why Klay Thompson is so important
Klay Thompson is categorized as a scrub
"When you consider those Thunder teams had literally ZERO spacing and ZERO offense it makes sense that KD’s efficiency numbers dipped in the playoffs. Also makes sense why his numbers jumped so much when he got put into an ACTUAL offense with all time great shooters. Point is any star’s efficiency is going to dip without any spacing around them, especially in the playoffs when defense gets A LOT tougher and more strategic.   KD’s second best shooter was Serge Ibaka, who was only still developing his three. Russ still can’t shoot to this day. You know who we paired our non shooting star PG with in the backcourt? Andre Roberson who is a walking brick, a guy who fucking ran away from defenders who were Hack-a-Shaqing him. On top of that our centers were Perkins and Adams. More non shooters. Rockets straight up traded all their centers and went 5 out to accommodate Russ. We had like 1 and a half shooters.   KD basically just played ISO in OKC with zero spacing. He was playing doubles, triples, or a man and a half his whole time in OKC. When you don’t even have to worry about the second best player shooting (in fact teams WANTED Russ to shoot), you just throw everything at KD. KD can and has proven to be great and efficient without Curry, but obviously he is going to be more efficient when playing with an all time great shooter. Especially when you compare it to what he had in OKC…they both benefited from each other.   Everyone only talks about how Curry helped KD on offense but not how KD’s versatility on D (can switch 1-5) and rim protection let the Warriors put out some dangerous offensive lineups. He unlocked the Hampton 5 for real. A lot of people just ignore Curry’s defense because he’s so great on offense and he’s always had great defenders to back him up. Also not a surprise that Curry’s playoffs numbers also got better when KD joined. Just enjoy them both. Ofc playing next to the greatest shooter ever and most dangerous offensive player ever is going to raise your efficiency. Also that guy Klay Thompson lol."
"Steph pulled out the WCSF, the WCF and Two finals games when the only other guy on his team that was capable of making a shot was Klay Thompson.  If you’re saying he should have done that without thompson then that’s simply too big of an ask. Theres no way in hell you’re winning a playoff series when your second best offensive player is Draymond and the role players are barely nba level.   Kobe found success with a supporting cast on par with the 2019 warriors without KD and Klay? When?"
"George Thompson, David Thompson Klay Thompson Tristan Thompson mychal Thompson"
Lakers fans are confident in their all NBA 2013 team and Warriors fans are confident that a hobbled ass Klay Thompson will take them from missing the playoffs to being the best team in the West. Big reality check coming for those two fanbases next season.
"Klay Thompson is a ""scrub"" - I'm assuming that missing a full year screws with the model"
"Man, ya'll are way too serious.      And what??? Klay Thompson is still being paid $40m/year. How is that situation similar  at all?"
Klay Thompson
"Y'all just wait when Klay ""I'm on a boat"" Thompson enters the building."
"Yes, Klay Thompson coming back from one of the most brutal injuries in sports is obviously better than Randle.  You sure got me."
Oh Klay Thompson is definitely one of those two selling points 😂
"Klay Thompson isn’t going to hurt at all. Iggy may be old but he is one of the highest IQ guys on the court at all times which fuels the dubs. Kuminga and Moody could help make an impact off the bench. Jordan Poole is primed for his best year (kind of a stretch but he could be a 6moty contender). Let’s not forget about Wiggins now, man is coming into his prime right now and he’s a solid 2 way player."
1. James Harden  2. Klay Thompson  3. Donovan Mitchell  4. Devin Booker  5. Zach LaVine  6. Bradley Beal  7. Jaylen Brown  8. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  9. Colin Sexton  10. CJ McCollum
cj mccollum is not and has never been better than klay thompson
"Above SGA.  But it's weird since I'd put Klay Thompson higher, injury or not"
"00-01 Kings. Peja firing threes like Klay Thompson, Vlade Divac distributing the ball like Jokic, and Jason Williams racing in a 130 point pace game? I'd be willing to pay a lot to watch that."
Klay Thompson said to picture a waterfall in reverse.
"Instead of MYCHAL MULDER, KENT BAZEMORE, DAMION LEE, KELLY OUBRE JR., ERIC PASCHAL, brad wannamaker, the Warriors will have KLAY FRICKIN THOMPSON taking the open shot .... Teams will have to keep an eye on Curry for 30+ minutes every night, running around screens whilst Klay will probably be setting those screens. Klay is more than a shooter and knows the Warriors ball movement and knows to pass it for a better shot. However, what's better than a Klay Thompson top of the 3 point line ball screen for Curry to pass the ball to Klay to shoot a couple feet behind the line? Or could give and go to Curry for the easy 3 or drive to the basket, only to open up an open shooter.  Too many possibilities with just Klay on the court with Curry. There's a reason why they were so dominant, those 2 are probably the best 1 2 offensive punch in NBA history. Klay won't need to sprint every minute he's on the court, I expect him to play smart since he's one of the smartest players on the team."
ESPN:  Klay Thompson air balls all his shots in practice.  Are the warriors in prime position to tank again?
"Switch klay thompson for Corey Brewer and Draymond for ariza and iguadola for beverley and I’d like to think harden would have been more efficient too.  Harden and Steph were probably around the same in terms of impact that season, I guess it just boils down to your definition of MVP. I feel harden should have won for carrying an absurdly bad roster to 2nd seed but if your definition is always best player best team I guess it was stephs"
Tbh I think Hornacek would improve more. AK47 was already a super effective player when he played. It’s a crying shame that Hornacek topped out at 3 attempts from 3 per game. Today he’d be a better version of Klay Thompson offensively. Was an absolute knockdown shooter that needed more license to let it fly.
Just watch Klay Thompson or Ray Allen for perfect form.   Then watch Steph Curry hit 105 in a row from the corner AFTER practice. It will make you laugh at all the videos you see of NBA players hitting 3s in a summer gym.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOrPF8OmN7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOrPF8OmN7g)
Watch a lot of Klay Thompson tape
"&gt;Defense: Pippen, Rodman, Jordan, Hakeem, Duncan  Some of these are definitely popularity contests. Jordan was an ATG defender, but not in the discussion for being in the discussion for greatest defender ever. Drob, KG and Russell being obvious snubs here.  &gt;Playmakers: Lebron James, Magic, Isiah Thomas, James Harden  If we consider that playmaking encompassing creating plays for others with your scoring gravity as well, then Shaq, Jordan, Kobe, Curry all fall under here as well.  &gt;Steals: John Stockton, Jordan, Payton  Nate Mcmillian had a season averaging 3 steals while only starting 8 games the entire season. I'd say honorable mention  &gt;Shooters: Steph Curry, Larry Bird, Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Klay Thompson, Dirk     Nash snubbed."
Bucks vs Warriors  Bucks have a better complete roster than the Nets and if Giannis can improve his mid range jumper then the difference between him and Durant isn't as wide as it was in the 21 playoffs.  A healthy Klay Thompson is going to take the Warriors from pretender to contender. Klay and Steph is still the best Backcourt in the NBA. Wiseman in his second season should have a huge develop.
John Havlicek was basically Klay Thompson of that era.
Espn: warriors rookie alludes to Klay Thompson air balling multiple warm up shots in a row. Is this the end of the splash bros?
"you can replace just ""Klay Thompson"" with ""Ben Simmons"" and no on would be surprised."
ESPN: KLAY THOMPSON NOT INTO RIMMING
"Michael Finley is an extremely underrated player. Arguably a more athletic Klay Thompson. Would be an all star in this Era for sure.  Also, here's a video of 17 year old Michael Finely (w. Jherri curl) playing 1 on 1 against Jordan: https://youtu.be/O4vwIq6u6lw"
Klay Thompson and I can hit the rim at similar rates.
"TIL that Klay Thompson and I both barely hit the rim, his go in of course."

"The past two years he has had significantly better scoring season than Klay Thompson has ever had, meanwhile Klay has been on the sideline for more than 2 years. Prime Klay is better than Prime Beal, but Prime Klay was 4 years ago, Beal is better now."
"Klay Thompson is not an elite All-NBA defender. Certainly he's a very good on-ball defender, but he lacks the awareness and quickness to do much of anything when it comes to off-ball/team defense, which is more than half the battle"
"When you take a step back it's even kind of weird to have a strong feeling about a professional player - like, these millionaires don't know you, they don't care about you, and here you are wasting your whole Thursday night arguing with another weirdo on Twitter because he put Klay Thompson above Kyrie Irving on his ""GOAT Players I Would Fuck If I Was Gay (I'm Not Gay)"" list.  But having strong feelings about a fucking agent? What are you doing? You can't play in a Fantasy Agent League. If there's a video game where you simulate being an agent, I bet it sucks ass. At least stanning for a player makes the smallest amount of sense, because they're cool and can do things you can't. Agents are just regular ass dudes."

"&gt; steph underperformed so they threw everything at stopping KD  Steph AVERAGED 25-7-5 on 71% TS in that series, 71%. They threw ""everything"" at KD, i guess everything was 9 inches shorter Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams.  &gt; steph also underperformed in the HOU series  Steph underperformed so much that when KD went down he carried Golden State to back to back wins and a 4-2 victory.  &gt; it was KD winning them games, hate to break it to u  KD was the best player on a team that without him still went to the Finals and was a Klay Thompson injury away from beating the Raptors. He was sensational, probably the best player in the league, but to act like there was no comparison between his 2019 version and Kobe in 2013, it is laughable."
lol maybe at the time 2017 warriors has the best pg arguably 2nd all time kd who is the best scorer of all time klay thompson 2nd best shooter of all time and good defender draymond dpoy and great offense intiator
In my dreams tonight: Klay Thompson probable against the Detroit Pistons.
"He's hot and cold, i've seen a couple of Sixers games, he's either Klay Thompson or.....well, Danny Green."
"I remember Kobe talking about Steph and Klay:  &gt;“Those guys are stone-cold killers man,” [Bryant](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/06/02/golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-klay-thompson-kobe-bryant-praise) told ESPN’s Cari Champion when asked who in the league has the “Kobe instinct.”  Steph is a fucking sadist in the way he enjoys stomping out all hope in his opponents."
Username checks out (unless we're comparing him to a hot Klay Thompson or a Steph Curry who just fumbled the ball)
"Don't worry, they got the warriors tomorrow which means expect any player in a shooting slump to turn into prime Klay Thompson from 3 (except for poor Josh Okogie today) and for every big man to turn into Dennis Rodman on the boards."
Klay Thompson gonna guest on commentary i heard
"KD and Russ picking different games to have awful shooting nights is pretty unlucky. If KD doesn’t fall apart in game 6, OKC could have weathered Klay Thompson going completely insane."
Right but your original argument was that Klay Thompson was replaceable. You’re telling me that if Draymond was playing his best ball and Jae Crowder was there they’d be as good as ever?
in what world is Danny Green waaay better than Duncan Robinson? Duncan Robinson’s 3 point shooting numbers rival prime Klay Thompson. Danny’s defense isn’t what it used to be and his shooting is league average now with stretches of him just disappearing. The 2019 Lakers likely get better with Duncan instead on Danny considering it wouldn’t be difficult to hide him on defense.
"I think Klay Thompson is the mega-evolution of a role player, but a role player nonetheless. At his core, he's a 3 and D guy"
Calling klay Thompson a role player is such a moronic statement I don’t even want to do the analysis
"So Drummond can’t be a role player for them, Drummond literally is a glorified role player. He does star level things but he’s a role player like a big man Klay Thompson"
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Ziaire Williams, Draymond Green, James Wiseman"
"It was ridiculous to watch. He couldn't miss. A few of those he tried. You can see it, he just hoists it towards the basket and it gets nothing but the net.    I've always loved Klay and his shot, and watching this was one of the best sporting moments Ive seen. Nobody in the league is as good as Klay Thompson when he's got. Curry is ridiculous, Luca is crazy. LeBron absolutely. But hot-klay is the most ridiculous player in the league."
Klay Thompson
"If Klay Thompson can get healthy and back to his usual form, he will be in the argument as well.  He gets overshadowed by Curry but knocks down volume threes with one of the purest shooting forms.  I think Ray Allen was a better shooter than Reggie but that's my personal opinion and I know it wasn't by much.  I thought Ray's all time record would stand forever but man Curry has  really revolutionized the game."

It’s an art. Even in like 2k for example (even though it’s a shit example but probably the most relatable to us all since none of us are nba athletes)everyone wants to be a scorer but nobody wants to be the pass first pg or wing defender. Like I did both because all my friends just wanna shoot but they make me play point because the only vision they have is the ball going in the net lmfaooo. And honestly scoring don’t really win championships that much. Chemistry Defense and great rotations can go a long way which has been the case with most teams the last few years. Even the warriors 2014-2018 they may be known for 3s but my god the ball movement and IQ they have on the court it’s insane not to mention you add in steph motherfucking curry who’s off ball movement is probably goat you have a great mix. I loved watching them play and that iggy mvp championship was one of the best championships I’ve watched since I’ve started watching basketball (I’m only 21 old heads) The system allowed everyone to do well so even if curry had a bad night klay or someone else could drop 40 on you. Look at the nets they have no system yet no good rotations no bench and get their ass handed to them. Look at the clippers when PG and kawhi are out they might as well put fans in the game. Look at Lebron’s old teams when he sat out im still in shock the Miami teams went negative in rating when he sat though. They had a fuck a lot of people but in the end TEAMS win games. That’s why I personally think some nba players and teams will never win. Any NBA caliber talent can come in and drop 20 but can they add to the defense can they play make can some defend multiple positions do they move well off ball. It’s why I like the nba now compared to back then. You can’t just be good at one thing anymore like the old days if you were just a paint guy that’s it. You have to evolve every asset of your game or you will not be there long. Hell even Tristan Thompson shoots 3s now. Would anyone have expected that 5 years ago ? Lol
"Warriors Clippers 2014. People may not think of this series as franchise altering, especially because it happened in the first round, but a lot of what happened in this series laid the foundations for the run in 2015. The Warriors were banged up at center and Draymond was made a starter in game 4 onwards because of his defensive work on Blake Griffen. A lot was made of the point guard matchup between CP3 and Steph, Steph proved that he could hold his own against other top point guards. The series was a dogfight and despite being banged up the Warriors took the Clippers to 7 and ended up losing 126-121 in a closely fought game 7. According to Jermaine O’Neal the Warriors took the loss extremely hard. He had an interview with Sports Illustrated where he mentioned, ”Afterward, in the locker room, O’Neal noticed something unusual. “Sometimes in pro sports other things trump being cut deep emotionally when you lose, so you don’t see a lot of that at the pro level,” he says. “Usually it’s more in high school and college.” But there, across from him, were two teammates weeping: Steph Curry and Klay Thompson. This resonated. “When your two best players are affected by losing like that, I knew right away they were going to be good the next year.”. After the game there was an altercation in the locker room between the two teams where apparently somebody on the Clippers walked by the Warriors locker room and said, “Sure is awfully quiet in there”. I think the combination of a tough, emotionally draining series where they came extremely close to knocking off the #3 seed Clippers and proving to themselves that they can hang with top competition in the west helped propel them to their first title the next year."
He’d probably play the Klay Thompson role of catch and shoot off ball since Klay can’t do it :(

How To With Klay Thompson
"Definitely I watched highlights of: this game, the 60 vs Indiana, and the 10 straight 3s against the Lakers and really was just in awe because Klay, Steph, and Dray just meshed so well from 2015-19 (w/ KD ofc being there for 3 yrs)  The back to back injuries really are just terrible and speaking of KD: seeing guys like him and John Wall hoop only gives me hope that Klay Thompson at least comes back on a decent level next szn"

Klay Thompson shouldn't forget that there was a whole lotta rigging in 2018 finals.
Klay Thompson about to retire and become a journey man among the sea.
Yatch enthusiast Klay Thompson
Simply Klay-Thompson-esque
I'm pretty sure its Klay Thompson.  RJ played with him early in his career and he dunked on him in the Christmas game.
"im 99% sure hes talking about klay thompson, i think ive heard that story before where he talks about dunking on klay on christmas day or something"
I'm guessing klay thompson usually tops this list when he's not injured
Warriors would got swept without Klay Thompson.
The day Klay Thompson got injured I bet 500 dollars on the Lakers thinking they were guaranteed to win it all. I honestly hope I lose that bet
"Donovan Mitchell made his 600th career 3-pointer last night.  He reached that mark in 240 games, the fastest player in NBA history to do so:  240 - Mitchell  244 - Buddy Hield  247 - Damian Lillard  248 - Klay Thompson  249 - Stephen Curry"
"Man its surreal to think about someone scoring 81 points in a game, and i watched it on television.  Always thought Klay Thompson or Devin Booker would go close."
1. Jokic 2. CJ McCollum 3. Klay Thompson 4. Bam Adebayo 5. Mitchell
I know who you mean... but the thought of Klay Thompson passive aggressively calling Kerr a pawn is hilarious to me.
It was quite infuriating watching jae crowder shoot wide open 3s against them in the playoffs. Dude was klay thompson that series
"I mean, there IS Klay Thompson, literally the best 3 and D player ever."
"Kentavious ""Steph ""Klay Thompson"" Curry"" Caldwell-Pope"
"Kyrie is definitely the best ""3rd option"" currently in the league, tbh he is probably the most overqualified 3rd option in the league since Klay Thompson or Chris Bosh"
Klay Thompson. I think he is more aggressive on D while still possessing some of the same insane range and scoring ability.
"I wouldn’t say the Klay Thompson role exactly, it’s like Klay but with more iso, I definitely agree that he needs to focus more 3pt shooting"
"Prime Klay Thompson. Not only would he fit in our offense great with his off-ball movement skills but also, i just love the guy. Plus, with his defense, we would be fixing our defensive problems in the guard position.   Sorry, Ray. I love you too"
&gt; ~~Kyrie~~ KD and Joe Harris can act as spacers  Kyrie needs to pat the ball. You can't make the guy with the best handles in the NBA Klay Thompson.
"I think it's reasonable to say that Wiseman has great upside and has shown flashes of skills that have the Warriors very excited for the future. I think it's also reasonable to say that as a whole so far this season, he has not greatly contributed to winning basketball.  He may very well end up being the best players in the draft but when Steph Curry is on your team at the tail end of his prime, you want to win now. Wiseman being great 4 seasons from now won't help the Warriors win today. Steph most likely will not still be great 4 seasons from now. Therefore, Wiseman isn't contributing to the current championship window.  I know Steve Kerr has to play him. It's just frustrating that even a league average big who knows where to be on defense would probably help the Warriors immensely right now. I guess the plan is to push all-in on next season when they get a hopefully healthy Klay Thompson back and Wiseman has had a full season of experience as well as a full off-season to work out within the Warriors franchise."

"&gt; his selfless nature and ability to create high-percentage looks for far-poorer talents.  Prime Harrison Barnes, Iggy, Draymond, Klay fucking Thompson and even Bogut are not far-poorer talents.  As amazing as Steph is, he is not the right guy to use as an example of individual contribution to team success. It can easily be argued that any of the current great players could have won a chip even with the pre-KD Warriors team."
He wasn’t The Klay Thompson in 2014
Collin pulled a klay thompson the last two overtimes wow
Damn!.  This is klay thompson 38 points in a quarter type of performance
https://twitter.com/celtics/status/1352057640403099648?s=20  can we talk about theis dipping without the ball and catching it on his way up like he's god damn klay Thompson? this is absurd
"The Cali section is misleading... not sure if that’s intentional. We have a TON of current NBA superstars (Harden, Derozan, Westbrook, Dame, PG, Klay Thompson, Jrue). And I think many would put Reggie Miller above Kawhi for “all time,” considering he is arguably the best shooter ever"
Klay thompson is just a spot up shooter. Carry on
Pretty sure Klay Thompson and Kevin Love were born in Oregon.
"During his 60 point game, Klay Thompson had the ball in his hands for *90 seconds*. 90 SECONDS! That's a point every 1.5 seconds that he had possession of the ball. Steph can't do that. KD can't do that. And Klay is a better on ball and off ball defender than either of them.  He's criminally underrated just because he doesn't fill the same role as other super stars, but nobody even comes close to Klay's level of success when it comes to being a supporting 3&amp;D guy."
"I don't see them missing the playoffs as long as Steph and Dray stay healthy.  At least two teams that people thought would be shoe-ins (Rockets and Blazers) don't look so certain anymore.   I've said it before (and was downvoted into oblivion): this has always been a playoff team.  If you think Klay Thompson would turn this team into top-4 seed, there's no effin' way it's a lottery team without him."
Healthy Klay Thompson.
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green.   6th Man: Eric ""Better Zion"" Paschall  Coach: Don Nelson"
"In terms of pure shooters he is probably the most well rounded except for klay thompson. Great finishing at the rim and cutting, good rebounding for his postion and can't be completely hunted on defense.   Absolutely worth the money. The harden/harris pnr broke the bucks elite defense. Having him on the floor with harden Durant and kyrie will be insane"
The off brand Klay Thompson
At this pace eventually one of these youngins will  come in here and say who is Klay Thompson?
"Love is pretty bad. He has an extra year, too. Klay Thompson might be in the conversation since he already lost two years of a max. All depends on how he comes back.   I’m just happy Westbrook is now consensus not the worst."
"There is no player I fear more with a series deficit than Klay Thompson. He shot 55% from 3 in the NBA Finals with every shot with a hand in his face while being guarded by one of if not the best switching defensive team ever, considering the fact that teams were only built that way in the 2010s"
"I know he’s out for the season... hella sad, but we all know Klay Thompson belongs in this conversation."
"&gt;He couldn’t win with D12, CP3, and WB, all of his hand picked teammates  Are we really going to compare those to Klay Thompson, Draymond and Iggy? Are we also just ignoring the record breaking bench squad they had? All three of those players were past their prime and are/were injury riddled messes. Only an ignoramus would think those two squads are even equal, and it would be asinine to think the Rockets' package better.   &gt;Klay, and arguably all of Harden’s star teammates were better than 2015 Klay.  Simply untrue. Klay is not only a perfect fit with Harden, but a better defender than the other guards and his best skill, **he could actually play**. CP3 missed 48 games during his Rockets tenure, and that's leaving out playoff games he's missed. Westbrook missed 25, meanwhile Klay has missed only 19 games since 2016-2020  Do you think the Warriors win 73 games with Klay not playing in 48 of them?   Dwight could not, and still can't create a shot for himself, and despite that, took it upon himself to learn mid-game, that's if he made it to the game, considering he missed 63 games during his tenure. And his acclaimed defense took a huge hit, pretty much not even guarding the PnR, to be fair, he didn't like the PnR on offense either.   &gt; hand-picked all-NBA teammates and couldn’t win with any of them  What a uninformed, baseless and moronic take you keep repeating. It seems you keep hammering that in because even you know your argument is garbage.   Just because they were ""handpicked"", *which they weren't*, doesn't mean anything. Harden never requested for Dwight (didn't have that kind of power at the time) or CP3 (CP3 chose to go to Houston). And even if they were, that doesn't truly mean anything besides elementary sports trash talk.   If anything it actually hurts your argument further, one could derive that Curry ""lucked"" into his situation in the first place.   &gt; he gets pass after pass and excuse after excuse is laughable.  That is half-baked, obtuse, purely ignorant and you know it. No other stars gets shit on more than Harden, and you know it, since you mindlessly contribute to it. If anyone is getting excuses, its Steph, laid an egg in every finals he's played in, whether getting locked up by Delly, get dusted by Kyrie or getting clamped by Lowry.   Its' fairly obvious that you have 0 idea what you're talking about and get all of your information from either r/nba comments, NBA twitter memes, and/or hot take sports shows that make your mind numb.   Not only is Harden objectively better than Curry, but your argument on the contrary are pathetic"
Lol Kyrie Irving is a much better offensive player than Klay Thompson. This isn’t even debatable.
"I think pretty much any team would make room for a healthy Klay Thompson, it just so happens that our roster still has a Klay-sized hole in it that we can't fill. That's just the life of losing a superstar with no cap space to spare."
Yeah if he was Klay Thompson we'd be spOOky
Nobody gives a shit about the masks. They just want to use it against Kyrie. If people actually cared about the pandemic they'd be calling to shut the season down becsuse of how many cases have occurred from it.  Klay Thompson has been spotted out without a mask plenty and noone gives a shit
"I genuinely don't understand how people seethe this much over Kyrie missing games and being seen at his Sister's Birthday. He's huge on family, chances are he sees most of those people frequently as is.   If y'all really are that worried about the players doing their part for the pandemic that you don't think a family event can't be attended to, maybe you should be rallying to shut down the season since there's a lot of spreading going on from games and practices. Maybe give Klay Thompson shit for hanging out with Offset members without a mask too. But he's 420weedklay so who cares right  &amp;#x200B;  He didn't miss all that time just to go to his sister's birthday party. there's obviously more, that was just the part that got exposed so people are clinging to it. but feigning concern about the pandemic as a reason is bullshit when we're all watching the same basketball season that's the reason for the virus spreading to multiple people each day.  &amp;#x200B;  he addressed his team. those are the only people that need to hold him accountable. it isn't redditors job to decide if his reasoning is good or not, just like it isn't up to people who sit on here 24/7 looking for reasons to shit on people (hypocritically, by the way) to determine whether or not he's a good enough dude."
"funny that Klay Thompson is being seen with Offset members downtown without a mask on and nobody gives a shit  &amp;#x200B;  I think most players don't care about masks. but fans care depending on who the player is.   &amp;#x200B;  people call it a ""party"" but it was his sisters birthday, not some random club. chances are most of the people that were there were people he sees on the regular."
"It's called coasting, the GSW don't even need Klay Thompson to beat the Lakers."
"Unbelievable fourth quarter by Golden State. How they held off the Lakers in the fourth the way they did may be an anomaly, but it surely was impressive. Makes me want to think about how good this team would be with Klay Thompson in the lineup. I'm a big fan of James Wiseman as well, and I was surprised to see him on the bench at the end of the contest last night."
Klay Thompson
"I mean that’s how I interpreted that quote. What do you think?  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2019/10/31/20941852/kevin-durant-left-warriors-free-agency-explanation-nets  “I came in there wanting to be part of a group, wanting to be part of a family, and definitely felt accepted,” Durant told the Wall Street Journal’s J.R. Moehringer. “But I’ll never be one of those guys. I didn’t get drafted there ... Steph Curry, obviously drafted there. Andre Iguodala, won the first Finals, first championship. Klay Thompson, drafted there. Draymond Green, drafted there. And the rest of the guys kind of rehabilitated their careers there. So me? Shit, how you going to rehabilitate me? What you going to teach me? How can you alter anything in my basketball life? I got an MVP already. I got scoring titles.”  “As time went on, I started to realize I’m just different from the rest of the guys. It’s not a bad thing. Just my circumstances and how I came up in the league. And on top of that, the media always looked at it like KD and the Warriors. So it’s like nobody could [give] a full acceptance of me there.”"
"Indeed, Klay Thompson is a glorified Joe Harris."
Like your boy Klay Thompson?
"This seems like a box score from 2016 (minus James being on the Lakers, etc.) Classic small ball, Kerr Warriors. I love to see it. If only Klay Thompson could have been on the court. :/"
"Well that's a fun idea.  Remember: the season is a breath. Soon the Blazers will vanish from your sight. The eye that looks will not see them; You may search but they will be gone. Like a Three fading into the net, the Blazers fade their season into death. And never come home again.  I fear not the Thompson who has practiced 10,000 shots once, but I fear the Klay who has practiced one shot 10,000 times.   It is the heart which perceives the Jazz and not the reason. That is what Jingling is: Jazz perceived by the heart, not the reason.  Rings are something final and complete in themselves, as being the aim and end of practical activities whatever.... Rings then we define as the active exercise of the mind in conformity with perfect goodness or virtue.  The only people for the Hawks are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.    Shit its harder than it looks, but fun."
"Sheesh, man. This team is supposed to have Klay Thompson too.."
LeBron would still only have 3 rings had Klay Thompson never gotten injured. 2 rings had Draymond never been suspended. 0 rings without Wade and Bosh.
"The SF equivalent of Tilman Fertitta buys the Warriors, fires all of Kerr's assistant coaches, is an asshole to Bob Meyers and makes him quit by forcing him to base all his moves around staying under the luxury tax even though they could contend, makes his 25 year old son a major decision maker in the franchise's front office, trades Klay Thompson for Russell Westbrook and gives up all their picks for the next 5 years in the process, and releases a book ironically named ""Shut Up and Listen"". I think that might do it."

"Andrew ""Klay Thompson"" Wiggins"
dude hes just like a lesser vers of Klay Thompson  kyrie harden KD plus a lesser Klay is straight up godly lmao
"Golden State: Doesn't really seem like Harden was too keen on going there, from recent news. Also, they probably dont have the package, unless they want to move wiseman maybe. Contrary to the opinion of this sub apparently, Klay Thompson is not a positive asset.  Denver: They have a really good thing going, with two faciliators comfortable handling the ball often. Trade probably disrupts things.  Miami: Hard to beat brooklyn offer without Bam. And Bam is not available in this trade. Butler is off the table.  LAC: lol  Toronto: Not sure about the package they could have put together, but i would have liked to see it  And Philly: All the evidence suggests that Philly really wanted to make a deal, and thought they had made a deal. Something weird happened here, it seems like they didnt even get a chance to counteroffer the brooklyn deal after they assumed it was done. Hard to believe Maxey was an absolute untouchable."
He's more of a Klay Thompson

Yea i see a poor mans Klay thompson than i do star lol
Joe Harris is the Nets version of Klay Thompson
The Nets really do have Klay Thompson at home
&gt;I just doubt whether a toaster can win an NBA championship.  Klay Thompson begs to differ.
"Part of what made the KD Warriors insane was the fit- Klay Thompson is most effective off-ball, Dray doesn't need the ball but he can keep it moving. Steph can excel with or without the ball in his hands. KD can excel with or without the ball primarily in his hands. They had a supporting cast with guys who could handle the ball and pass, but didn't demand it. There were so many different ways they could maximize their stars' abilities and get everyone shots.  With the Nets, it is less clear to me how they can maximize each guy with this roster, particularly what Kyrie's role is going to be if Harden is handling the ball a lot. Kyrie is not Klay Thompson. I don't see him excelling as an off-ball player. He's a good shooter but I don't think he wants to just be a catch-and-shoot guy."
Especially Klay Thompson
"His parking permit is his ID.   It's a low-key ""Y'all know who I am. I'm Klay Thompson"" move lol"
"You guys are weird. For real. Why is this upvoted so much? I don't get it.   Recently whenever I browse r/nba - top, there is some really normal story about Klay Thompson and with tons of comments about how it's such a Klay thing to do, such a Klay thing to say, such a Klay thing to think etc..."
“Mike Brown on hooking up with Klay Thompson in a parking lot”
"If you're Klay, you can in fact park your boat anywhere in the Bay. Pull up at a private wharf? It's fine your Klay Thompson."
Today? I'd say Klay Thompson
I read this as “hooking up with Klay Thompson”
"&gt; Zeke won in the era of Bird, Magic, and MJ. Has a winning playoff record against each of them. Especially when no one believed a small guard could lead a team to a championship.  So? Steph has still done more winning than Zeke, and didn't need to dirty while doing it.  &gt; He inspired a whole city and its kids to dream again, everyone loves him in Detroit. See Chris Webber's HoF speech just as an example.  Steph literally inspired this generation of players, as well as the whole league, to adopt the volume 3-point shooting. Zeke's influence did not even reach other countries in North America, as compared to Steph's worldwide influence.  &gt; . I think even Nash could have been better than Steph if he was drafted in 2009.  He is a great player, but you underestimate the impact of his lack of scoring ability.   &gt; Nash was a better passer and a comparable shooter.  Passing isn't equivalent to playmaking. Steph, even in his bad games, gets double-teamed constantly. His off-ball gravity is a great reason why Klay Thompson and Draymond Green blossomed to the players they are.  Steph is the GOAT shooter. He shoots about 1% better than Nash despite shooting 5.2 more times per game.   Your whole argument is infallible, and exhibits ""oldhead"" tendencies people who can't let go of the past in relation to NBA are prone to display.   At the end of the day, it's your opinion, but posting it on an online forum leaves it open to criticism."

"Obviously the Raptors ring is well-earned — they put themselves into position to take advantage of a massively lucky opportunity — but come on...   The Warriors got 1 quarter of a very hobbled Durant before he tears his Achilles, Klay Thompson strains his hamstring and misses Game 3, then tears his ACL in the 3rd quarter of Game 6. I don't know if anyone *actually* thinks the Raptors could beat the Warriors in a healthy series. It would go 5 games absolute maximum with the Warriors blowing the Raptors out in at least 2-3 of them."
"It’s impossible to say,   Teams needs are constantly fluctuating and injuries happen which completely change the landscape of the game.   Think if Klay Thompson for example can’t recover from a torn ACL and Achilles? What if a player like Embiid snaps his leg?   There are so many things that could happen which completely change what happens moving forward. At the moment there isn’t as many bad big contracts, but there are always injuries in sports and some contracts will start to change value in the next few months"
"Boban or Klay Thompson, definitely."
Khris Middleton  &gt; Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson vibes :(
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

Klay Thompson should be in this discussion. Man’s be dropping 60 and be off boating to his girl or to Rocco. Not to mention the random interviews and meme content he provides. Winning off and on the court lmao.
Klay Thompson
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
Kevin love for klay Thompson the warriors would have sucked with love since ir would diminish draymond's role
"They’d have to play differently but giving Harden shooters like Klay Thompson or Durant and a DPOY pretty much a slam dunk chip. IMO anyway. PJ Tucker had one offensive tool and Harden had him close to 40% from 3. Klay would’ve been an insane complement to Harden’s ball-dominant style. Ariza famously went 0-12, think Thompson does that? I don’t."
"Klay Thompson, CP3, Jrue Holiday, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Trae young, and more are ALL &gt; Westbrook"
Khris Middleton &gt; Klay Thompson and it isn’t that close
One of the YT ads I get is a vax PSA that ends with Klay Thompson. So I'd say that counts. I think Tyler Herro was in it too.

"What, in terms of point guard responsibilities, is he better at then Harden? He is a better shooter. That's kind of it. Having multiple titles when you had 3 years of Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green as teammates doesn't mean he's a better PG. And the year he didn't have KD, the Cavs had as bad of injury luck as this years Nets"
lol. Why doesnt the Sixers simply make Seth Curry into Steph Curry and Tobias Harris into Klay Thompson?
"Who tf looks at Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, 73 wins,  Steve Kerr with a championship already  won and comes to the conclusion ""Yeah man, true underdog story""   Dude just spouts off different nonsense every time he's asked about it."
"Huge fan of Bane playing a klay Thompson role, man's a sharpshooter"
People really think Klay Thompson is Andre Iguodala on defense 😭
"Klay Thompson is definitely among the top 100 shooting guards of all time. Probably in the top 50.  If he comes back from his multiple catastrophic injuries and plays at a high level again for several more years, he's even got a shot at the Hall of Fame."
Hmm well based on his career and comparing it to others in tiers I kinda have him 12th:      Tier 1: GOAT level.      - Michael Jordan.        ----       Tier 2: Sustained MVP level.   - Kobe Bryant.   - Jerry West.   - James Harden.   - Dwyane Wade.          ----          Tier 3 Short MVP level peak.    - Allen Iverson.   - George Gervin.     - Clyde Drexler.            ----            Tier 4 High Level All-NBA peak.   - Tracy McGrady.          Tier 5 High Level All-Star.   - Ray Allen.      - Reggie Miller.   - Klay Thompson.    - Manu Ginobli.    - Mitch Richmond.
"If you go with Curry you have to get defenders to make up for him. He doesn't come with Klay Thompson, Andre Igoudala and Draymond Green."
Klay Thompson? Idk that’s a tough question
I feel the same way about Klay Thompson not congratulating the Cavaliers in 2016
Kyle Lowry and Klay Thompson?
"Hated team all the way. Not that the loved team is bad by any means, but the hated team has Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Paul George. I’m not sure they would ever miss a bucket, as basically the only two defenders on the loved team are Middleton and Giannis.  On top of that, you have Rudy Gobert and KD protecting the rim, and you have two really good defenders(so long as they are putting in the effort) in James Harden and Paul George, and a guy who doesn’t have the size to be effect, but is at least going to put in the effort in Kyrie.  Aside from that, switch out Middleton for Klay Thompson. I think this sub doesn’t give Middleton the credit he deserves, but this sub *loves* Klay Thompson.  Also, Westbrook and Lebron have to be on the hated team over Gobert and PG. I don’t think anyone truly hates either Gobert or George.  Even if you make those changes, I’m still taking the hated team."
"Harden had to go up against the ""scrubs"" named Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson every year lol"
"Lebron, Klay Thompson, Spurs Kawhi Leonard, AD, Hakeem.  Probably a better defense, and better offensive fit around a Heliocentric Lebron. Your team has more offensive creation but it’s kind of redundant. I’d still probably take your team but I made it close with less talent"
"a shooter’s reputation matters waaaay more than how they’re currently shooting. roberson would have to shoot 60% contested threes from the logo for a whole season before any defense ever takes him seriously. it’s great that a professional shooting guard shot 32% though with all five defenders eating popcorn 90 feet away daring him to pull up  i read that every team recruiting kd that year had video highlights about how he had to work waaaaay too fucking hard to generate offense. you’re reciting KD’s shooting that series like apex draymond green (he’s washed now), andre iguodala and klay Thompson weren’t swarming him on every possession"
"A comparison would be like if a Jaylen Brown for Klay Thompson trade happened right now. You can sorta see the logic of it, but it's not a good idea"
"There was the big almost thrice, each of which I think would have guaranteed a championship.   There were strong rumours of Blake Griffin joining okc, when exactly I'm forgetting.  The rumour that Al Horford would have signed if kd resigned, providing a big upgrade over Steven Adams and a lot more spacing/flexibility.  The biggest, of almost getting Klay Thompson. That trio of russ kd and Klay would have just ended games"
C: Nikola Jokic  F: Tobias Harris  F: Klay Thompson   G: Anthony Edwards   G: Luka Doncic
"Love is an interesting example because it seems like he was better athletically when he was heavier. Now the injuries obviously don’t help in that regard, but I remember him not able to back Klay Thompson down in the post. If you’re a 4 with the vertical to barely clear a phone book you’re gonna need to be able to manhandle guards in the post - even if they’re great defensive guards, they’re still a mismatch"
"&gt;  Except you don't have a championship core.  Except we won a championship with this core and at least 2 of them are every bit as good as they were when we did.  &gt;  You have a 9th seed core that you're adding Klay Thompson back into.  If Klay is his old self when he comes back then you've got a top team in the west and you can make win now moves.  Yes that's the entire point...  &gt;  If he isn't then you need to reevaluate.  If he doesn't we're fucked anyway.  But he had the same new surgery as KD, it was successful, and his recovery has gone very well.  &gt;  Plus, all the activity going on right now is around Ben Simmons, who doesn't fit the Warriors at all. You gotta wait for those moves to play out.  Morey or Rich Paul leaked that to the media.  Our front office, according to our very reputable franchise reporter, was never interested in Ben Simmons.  One team out of 30 wins a chip every year.  All time greats are missing them.  If you have even an outside chance to win one, you take risks like whether Klay will come back close to form."

2016 Klay Thompson on 2016 OKC Thunder
"God forbid you go for a rebound...  Alternatively, maybe small guys should avoid going towards the trees because the injury risk goes up precipitously. There can be very little sympathy for a guy that goes hard at the rim and gets injured somehow, because there *are* basketball moves (for the other side) that will injure them. Reminds me of Danny Green undercutting Klay Thompson. This is the playoffs, you never give up the rim."
"I still think that OKC team was built for success though. It's unfortunate that it was pretty much only their starting 5 + Waiters vs. the Warriors, but they pretty much had the Warriors on the ropes and it took Klay Thompson going absolutely supernova and Curry having an underrated closing performance to barely lose."
If GSW gave Draymond Green or Klay Thompson to the Trailblazers we would have beat them in the conference finals a few years back.
"They're not switchable in today's NBA and especially not against the Warriors. Plenty of bigs have gotten ""exposed"" and ""played off the court."" This would be no different. They'd do a better job than Kevin Love but the result would be the same.  I'll bring up just one of the many unguardable Warriors playtypes: the PnR.   If they hedge/switch in the 3pt PnR, they Warriors will end up a bunch of easy options. Curry/KD can get the switch and blow by the big and create a scoring opportunity for themselves or another player. If they trap, they'll hit Green/Iguodala/KD on the short roll for a 4v3 that'll result in a good look. If they do drop coverage, then it's an easy look.   Also, the Curry Durant PnR is just unguardable. You switch and then Curry has a mismatch on either Wallace and KD has a mismatch on Billups on the catch or in the post. They can also run this off ball with Draymond or Iguodala facilitating up top. If you top lock the Curry Durant screen then they can also immediately go back door (either the cutter or the screen could slip the screen) and either Green or Iguodala is more than capable of hitting that cut on the money. There's going to be so much space on that strong side that the rim would be uncontested because no one is going to cheat off of Klay in the corner.   And this is only one playtype on one side of the court. The 2017 Warriors defense was super elite and would defend the Pistons very well. In a matter of minutes they could just explode on a 20-0 run and the game would be over.   The Pistons defense was incredible. No one is scoring 1v1 in the post against Ben Wallace. Yes, they were highly switchable at the time but its different when they're asked to cover off ball actions that end up at 15 ft from the basket vs 30 ft from the basket. They can cover one or two steps to the free throw line but the 3pt line is way way farther out. Also, most defensive possessions have the whole team right by the paint. The spacing is so much different. You can't trap or double like you did back then.  Not to mention, that there's barely any off ball movement. Offenses would have one guard at the top of the key, one guy in the low post, one guy in the dunker spot, one guy at the top of the key and one guy in the corner (but not corner 3. They'd usually be a step inside) vs the Warriors that would often have nobody in the paint except for when they're cutting.  Rewatch a Pistons Lakers Finals game and rewatch a Warriors Cavs Finals game and look at how drastically different the coverages are. It's a lot easier to double Shaq when the guy you're cheating off of is just at the elbow and that shot is not that efficient vs Klay Thompson in the corner.   Again, this is not to discredit the Pistons. The 2017 Warriors are arguably the greatest team ever and I think KD Curry screen action is possibly the most unguardable play"
"If he ever leaves he will go back home to Charlotte but I don't even see that happening. People gotta realize Steph is incredibly important to the bay area, along with Klay Thompson those dudes are borderline extended family out here. They are both highly involved in the community and can be spotted in public quite more often then some would think. He got murals all over Oakland like he's a saint too."
Klay Thompson (more so can get hot than both hot and cold) and Jrue holiday offensively this year was that way.
"recall how physical defenders guys can play Steph in the playoffs now, now imagine there is full on hand checking and he doesn’t have Klay Thompson(who is the perfect SG partner for Curry)."
"Injuries are injuries, and basketball is physical. Everyone is always at risk. Klay Thompson was an iron man until he wasn't. Same with Kobe. Same with Karl Malone."
"They'd be a tall, athletic Klay Thompson. Zero dribbling, just shooting over everyone."
"except ws/48 isn't indictive of actual skill. Look at that list, for the 2018-19 season, and tell me if the results are remotely useful. Javale mcgee is a top 40 player in the league while kemba walker, bradley beal, draymond aren't. Klay thompson isn't in the top 100 players in the league. it doesn't show anything"
You guys remember the times when this sub was 100% convinced Klay Thompson as a 1st option replacing prime Truth would've won more than 1 championship and put up a better stretch in the late 2000s-early2010s Celtics era
"Agreed Kevin Mchale is underrated but zero chance he’s a top 3 PF ever. Timmy, KG, Dirk, Karl Malone, Chuck were all MVPs and 3 of those guys were the best players on championship teams. Kevin McHale was a Robin, he was never the primary option and was actually in the perfect situation possible. Definitely a great scorer and elite defender but all the other 5 PFs ahead of him were the 1st option for the majority of their careers which is much more valuable to me than being the second/third option on a all time great team. I would compare him to having a Klay Thompson/Draymond Green kind of role except he was probably closer to having the impact of a Dwyane Wade in 2012/2013."
Kyrie Irving - Klay Thompson - Kawhi Leonard - Kevin Durant - Kristaps Porzingis
"In the context of this upcoming season I am going to have to say Klay Thompson.  I don't care who you are, you don't miss two years of and come back the same.  Everybody is talking like the warriors are back now that he is healthy etc.  There is just to much unknown at this point on how he will perform to grant the warriors a pass in the west.  I think it will take him half a season at least to get consistent results."
It's Klay Thompson cause you people act like he's gonna make the warriors a contender after not playing basketball for 2 years.
"LeBron James has 27pts per game on 0.504% (0.34% from 3) at 19.5 attempts for his career  Michael Jordan  has 30.1pts per game on 0.497% (0.32% from 3) at 22.9 attempts per game  So Jordan shoots 3 shots more per game than LeBron and still shoots only 0.007% less than him. And he only shoots the 3 at 32% because the 3 ball wasn't important at the time + plus its not like LeBron is Klay Thompson, he became serviceable 3 point shooter the last 4, 5 years.  I'm not even gojng to bother with playoffs where I think Jordan has more points than him at better efficiency."
"Bird may have not been an elite athlete by explosiveness standards... but I think he was in the ballpark of Klay Thompson athleticism - equivalent for his bigger position.  Combined with his height, shooting, playmaking, skills and BBIQ he would be one of the best players in the modern game."
What’re Lukas numbers be Klay Thompson? I think they’ve only played in Lukas rookie year right?
"Started playing basketball since I was 3 years old. Only tuned in to my local basketball league which was absolute blockbuster gold at that time. Now, its shitty.  2008-2009. My family had cable and the Lakers and Celtics were flashy teams. Ray Allen is my very first guy coz I love the 3 ball ever since. Kinda hated Kobe coz I thought he was cocky. LeBron was popular in the circle too. Kinda liked him but I just have a disdain for stars who are not good at shooting so he's meh to me at first impression.  2011, I got Facebook and got into NBA Memes (Pass? Just get the rebound). Hated LeBron coz that's what everybody did (I was young). Went to my cousin's house one day coz I have a potato computer that can't run Powerpoint and he had a reputable PC with a good CPU and GPU. He had 2k11 installed and playing it for the first time was heavenly. I even managed to get on the sliders. I was playing the Lakers at that time and just watching Steve Blake shoot 10 3s in a row decimating the Celtics was peak entertainment. I kept using him coz I don't know him. He's white and looks super unskilled compared to Kobe  Came back there like 2 weeks later and I decimated the Lakers using the GOAT Brian Scalabrine with 214 points. In my mind, I was like ""I gotta get a copy of this game coz I wanna try so many things""  Got the game and played it on a Netbook (its my only computer at that time). It wasn't a good experience so I had to put all settings on ultra low and use Cheat Engine speedhacks to slow the gameplay down increasing the fluidity of the game. Literally hyped when I saw Mike Miller dunk in the span of 10 seconds.   About one year later, mom decided to buy a brand new PC coz she doesn't want me visiting my cousin's house every time we had a big project. It was an i3 with no GPU whatsoever but it ran 2k11 well enough (with astonishing graphics in my eyes). It was the perfect time to milk the hell out of the game. It was summer and I got circumcised and my parents were totally ok with me playing with my brand new computer all summer. I even had the time to download mods (EG FIBA and Slam Dunk 2k11)  2013 forward, I started to follow NBA and pick a team. Before Stephen Curry's infamous 54 point explosion at MSG, my favorite players were Steve Nash and Ricky Rubio because other than the 3 ball, I like point guards who does flashy passing and outsmarting the opponents. When Steph Curry happened, I started to idolize him in 2013. It helps that his teammate is also a shooter in Klay Thompson. So I mained the Warriors in 2013. I actually thought the Warriors could beat the Miami Heat in the Finals during 2014. I was pissed off when Steph missed that Game 7 dagger when I knew that should've been a foul and we would've eliminated the Clipper's ass.   My investment in GSW was the one of the best things I ever did.  2015 to 2018 I was nutting all day coz Steph Curry GOATED. Sucked that they blew a 3-1 lead but hey 2nd best PG of all time baby.   TL;DR it all started in TV then it quickly developed in 2k then Reddit (which is probably my biggest mistake ever that I will never regret, never change r/nba)"
"Dennis Rodman (Not in the league currently but shut up, it's a great example.)  Draymond Green  Andrew Wiggins  Klay Thompson  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly, Clarkson is a roleplayer to me. His role is volume scoring off the bench."
"That is a horrible starting lineup. There is absolutely ZERO spacing outside of Steph and a most likely diminished Klay Thompson. All the other teams would have to do is completely ignore Simmons, dray and looney to bog everything down."
The klay Thompson
"Giannis, AD, Embiid. Any of those 3.   Starting 5 of Luka, Giannis, Seth Curry, Hardaway Jr. and Klay Thompson would reck shit. If you think Klay may not return to form just replace him with a DECENT 3 and D, Lonzo etc. These are just some of my favorite players from around the league that I feel would complement each other well"
"why is it so hard to believe that a guy drafted what, five years after the line was established, would be better at shooting in a world where almost every superstar, even at the center position, is knocking down threes?  If Jordan came into the league in ‘94 or even 2004, I don’t think anything really changes until he’s about to retire. But if MJ is born 30 years later and the only thing that’s different for him is the time in which he’s living, I think it’s reasonably safe to say he’d both shoot a lot more threes and would probably shoot a few percentage points higher. The way the game is *taught* is different now, from a super young age. If guys like DeMarcus Cousins, Marc Gasol, Brook Lopez and Nik Vucevic can go from banging in the post to threats beyond the arc makes me think that Jordan would have a good chance to develop as a good volume shooter from three, because nowadays that’s a glaring hole in someone’s game. When Michael Jordan played, who was belaboring him to shoot more threes? Where are all the people criticizing Magic and Isiah Thomas’ inability to make threes as a vital hole in their games? Nobody gave a shit about spacing, at least not anywhere near to the extent that they do now, during Jordan’s career. All of that being said, if he’s definitely taking tougher threes in this fake timeline, so I think it’s pretty silly to project him being like Klay Thompson or some shit. I could see his numbers looking kinda like Booker’s from three.   &gt;Why isn’t this retroactive projecting of skillsets done for other players as well?  that’s a really good question honestly, it’s just a fun thought exercise about how players skills are utilized and developed with the way the game is seen and played.   I think if Larry Bird came around today, he’d have even deeper range and would shoot over a dozen threes a game in some seasons, and the ball is in his hands even more. He’s probably a PF, but I could definitely see some Larry at the 5.   Dominique Wilkins is someone I wouldn’t see being an amazing shooter even in the modern game, but holy shit he’d shoot like 55% just by attacking the hell out of the rim with the spacing today.  Bring Kevin Garnett into the league 20 years after he actually debuted and I think I could believe anything. He’s another guy that in theory could expand his range because of his proficiency in the midrange, but this, as literally this entire thread is, is just speculation.   Finally, Charles Barkley would be a fucking god even with the exact same skillset. I mean shit, he actively shot threes in the 80’s and 90’s and was awful at them, and I just can’t imagine Chuck being different than he is now at any point in human history"
"Passing: Steve Nash, John Stockton, Magic Johnson, Chris Paul, LeBron James  Shooting: Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Klay Thompson  Perimeter defense: Kawhi Leonard, Scottie Pippen  Post offense: Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Amare Stoudemire  Post Defense: Dwight Howard, Hakeem Olajuwon"
"When has Curry? As soon as Klay Thompson got hurt, Curry couldn't even make the playoffs. While Durant won MVP and was a second seed in the West while Westbrook was hurt."
"Klay Thompson. He's a shooting guard for the Golden State Warriors, though he's suffered an injury last November, and he's still out."
Klay Thompson is a *superstar* now?
"For fuck's sake, this is the same Simmons for Wiggins-Wiseman-and-the-rookies idea the Warriors hung up on months ago. Of course that might be attractive to Philadelphia and other teams.  &gt;  if the Klay Thompson return doesn't go according to the best-case scenario, if he's, say, particularly diminished as a defender, Simmons might start to look pretty attractive.   He might, but we won't know that until January or February, will we? While the point of this article is about a way for the Sixers to send off Simmons before training camp. I don't think the writer has thought this through."
"I think that Don Nelson was just REALLY high on Billy Owens and wanted a power forward (which is odd, because Owens ended up playing SF most of his career).   Owens was a solid player. No doubt.  But when you have an All-NBA calibre player, you don't dump him for the 3rd overall pick.   Can you imagine the Warriors trading Klay Thompson at the age of 25 for a Dragan Bender, Krish Dunn, Brandon Ingram, or Jaylon Brown?  It's a little different, sure, but still...   I don't think it was a cap issue.   Certainly, in 10-15 years, kids will look back on the James Harden trade and, being unaware of the cap situation, will think ""That was stupid."" A one-year rental on Kevin Martin and Steve Adams for James Harden?  And that was a BAD trade, even given that it was done for cap reasons (though Kevin Martin was expected to play better)."
As Klay Thompson says only boring people get bored.
Mark Jackson was kind of an incredible developer on that end. Klay Thompson was also seen as not very quick laterally coming out but then he became one of the best perimeter defenders in the league
"&gt;  Listen to your logic: If a player has to take breaks on defense to perform on offense, then he’s not a good defender (he may have good defense skills but he’s not helping the team on the defensive end).  Okay, so rather than refute my arguments, you've moved onto another unrelated and incorrect point.  Here's a fun fact:  FVV scored more points per possession more efficiently after Steph switched off of him.  Here's another fun fact:  Kyle Lowry scored fewer points per possession on lower efficiency when Steph switched onto him.  Steph is not an elite defender, I never made that argument.  But people who argue he's a bad defender don't watch his defense and don't understand how much your brain matters on that end.  &gt;  I’m not saying he’s terrible on defense, but he’s not a top 10 isolation defender just because some metrics rank him top 10.  Actually he's pretty good.  In the history of the finals, no player has ever been targeted as much on switches as Stephen Curry.  And there's a reason for that, it roughs him up and tires him for the other end, it's a strategy that works.  But in isolation in the playoffs (think LeBron and Harden) he actually held them to fewer points per possession on lower efficiency with more turnovers than their averages.  People think because they hunt him that he's a bad defender.  They hunt him so he doesn't drop 40 points in 22 shots on offense.  They hunt him because their other options were Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston etc.  He does particularly well against stronger, taller players because he's stronger than he has any right to be and a low center of gravity relative to them.  People like JR Smith embarrass themselves trying to take advantage of that ""mismatch"".  Does that mean he's going to stop LeBron a meaningful amount?  No, he needs serious helpside to guard a 6'8 monster like LBJ.  But he does a pretty good job of holding his ground until help rotates or steering him into more defenders."
Klay Thompson. Prick kept intercoursing the clippers during the lob city days. He’s a killer tho tbh
"On any given play a player could be anyone of the three,also this pretty much only happens during half court situations,because positions definitely don’t matter during transition.  If Jokic sets up in the high post,he’s a post player at that point in time,if he gets a rebound and brings it down the court,he’s a ball handler(I’ll add that ball handler isn’t a great term,because if the reasons you pointed out,a better term would be initiator). If Jokic for some reason spots up in the corner,like if a transition opportunity breaks down and if he finds himself open in the corner,he would be a wing. Also most of the time Jokic operates in the post,whether that’s the high post or out of a screen and move set.  Other examples of players that fit into all three are KD,LeBron,Kobe,and a lot of others.  Many of the all time greats can do all of them,because that’s what makes them all time greats.  Also an easy way of finding out what they would be referred to as(like if it were to replace the 1-5 classifications) in my weird way of positions:  Point Guard:99% of the time would be a ball handler/initiator  Shooting Guard:either a ball handler or a wing. James Harden and CJ McCollum are ball handlers,Klay Thompson is a wing  Small Forward:Could feasibly be all of them,like KD and LeBron  Power forward:Wing or post,Marcus Morris is a wing,Anthony Davis is a post player  Center:99% of the time would be classified as a post player"
"As a kid, I was not a fan of the Lakers. Like at all. Despised the Shaq and Kobe duo, but, over time, I learned to respect them both  More recently, Klay Thompson. The **deep** three he hit against the Thunder, during the 2016 WCF, made my jaw drop, along with his performance in that game.  I was part of the bandwagon that hated on the Heat(les), but, that's because they were so good."
"&gt;maybe the best dunk contest ever with Lavine and Gordon  I'm pretty sure the entire ASW was one of the best if not the best ever as well. The 3 point contest was star-studded with Devin Booker, James Harden, Kyle Lowry, Khris Middleton, JJ Redick (who was lead the league in 3P% that year at 47.5%), Klay Thompson, CJ McCollum and Stephen Curry. It went down to the wire between Steph and Klay- with Klay taking it all by saving his all-moneyball rack for last. The skills challenge was also one of the better ones in memory as it was the first time a big won it (KAT beating IT in the final round)"
"If you look at the numbers embiid (and to a lesser extent Jokic) is pretty much the only center in the game with an efficient post up game. I’d rather Rudy not post up than do so a bunch of times inefficiently. Rudy actually posted up a lot more when he came into the league and cutting that out was a big part of him becoming a better player. It’s also funny you point out rim running as a way to make up for a lack of a post game when Rudy’s the best rim runner in the league, and that’s kind of my whole point.   Yes 77% of his shots are assisted. Karl Malone had a higher % of his shots assisted and he was a pretty damn good player. That stat doesn’t really mean anything.   Just because he doesn’t create for himself doesn’t mean he’s not a good offensive player. Klay Thompson doesn’t really create for himself much either and he’s still pretty good.   Offense was not our problem vs the clippers. We had an Orating over 120 and Rudy shot 73% from the field against the clippers. We had trouble finding him because without Conley we didn’t have another point guard on the roster, but Rudy would’ve had to be even more efficient than Embiid posting up to make our offense better that series."
"that doesn't move the needle for the blazers. The more you think about it the Blazers either need to make a HUGE move to pair Dame with a superstar or two, or simply ship Dame out while they can get a haul for him and atart rebuilding.  Because currently they are like the 4th best team in the West and that's assuming Klay Thompson doesn't come back firing on all cylinders which puts the Warriors right back in the playoffs."
"Klay ""The most beautiful jumper in existence"" Thompson starts potty shotting free throws...."
"“Be friends with Klay Thompson” is skyrocketing to  the top of my bucket list. Do you, Klay. Do you."
Klay Thompson is a beautiful personality.
"I don’t think they’re a contender, but anything can happen. Phoenix made the finals last year lol. I know everyone’s already writing off klay but they did the same thing with KD, there’s a realistic possibility that Klay Thompson is still klay thompson, add to that Curry playing at an MVP level and draymond still being a high level glue piece with his playmaking IQ and dpoy level defense anything’s possible.   A year from now i won’t be surprised if you told me golden state is the 2 seed with Curry, Dray and Klay all playing like themselves and Wiseman, Kuminga, Poole and Moody all developing and contributing. I also wouldn’t be surprised if you told me they’re in the play-in game again Klay is done, Dray regressed, and all their young guys weren’t plus impact players."
You can argue KD’s offense is so good it doesn’t matter if Giannis is the significantly better defender.  Just because a player is two way doesn’t mean he’s automatically better than an offensive juggernaut. Offensive juggernauts are the reason why top tier teams are relevant in the first place and yes Offense &gt; Defense. Warriors we’re 5th in defense and was unable to make the playoffs. Meanwhile Blazers we’re 29th in defense and they’re the 6th seed.   Even I think James Harden is a better player than Klay Thompson c’mon guys.
"Kawhi, Kyrie and Klay are pretty much locks for HOF I think. Butler has a chance if he wins a championship before the end of his career. So yeah makes sense. 2018 at this moment is definitely weaker, but then again it’s only been 3 years. Luka is definitely going to be a HOFer, Trae too most likely. Maybe Ayton, but don’t think it’ll surpass 2011, that year also had players with high peaks like IT, Kemba, Vuc and other solid players like Morris twins, Tobias Harris, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas etc. Pretty deep draft with some top talent."
Klay Thompson is my power animal
"  Wariors advance to first West finals since '76 after closing out Grizzlies  MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Stephen Curry practices tough shots every day. The MVP came up with a third-quarter buzzer-beater his coach calls the play of the game. For Golden State, rank it among the Warriors' best shots in decades, and it helped put them in their first Western Conference finals since 1976.  Curry scored 32 points with that 62-footer among eight 3-pointers, and the Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies a third straight game, 108-95, on Friday night.  ""In a closeout game like that, that's a big turning point and the moment's magnified,"" said Curry, the NBA's MVP. ""I made one in college like that. That's the last I made anywhere past half court and same kind of shot: loose ball, grab it, throw it up and knock it down."" First-year coach Steve Kerr called this a beautiful team win and a big moment for the Warriors. He said Curry was amazing, especially with that shot as the Grizzlies tried to make a run in the third quarter. ""It wasn't quite a closeout shot, but it was the play of the game,"" Kerr said. The Warriors advanced with some of the best shooting in the NBA postseason since 1985, becoming the first team since that year to hit 14 or more 3s in three consecutive playoff games. Curry was 8-of-13 from beyond the arc as the Warriors knocked down their playoff-best 15 3-pointers. Curry, who had 10 assists for his first double-double this postseason, hit the shot of the night after Andre Iguodala blocked Jeff Green's shot near midcourt. Curry grabbed the loose ball and beat the buzzer from the Grizzlies' 3-point line for a 76-68 lead. Klay Thompson had 20 points for Golden State, and Draymond Green added 16, Harrison Barnes 13 and Shaun Livingston 10. Memphis coach Dave Joerger said he hadn't seen the replay of Curry's shot. Grizzlies guard Mike Conley said he thought Green was fouled and that his teammates stopped playing, waiting for the call, and then Curry threw up the shot. ""It was tough to realize and kind of grasp it all in the same time,"" Conley said. The Warriors will play the winner of the Los Angeles Clippers-Houston Rockets series in the conference finals. That series will start Tuesday night at Golden State. Curry says the opponent does not matter. ""We'll obviously be watching on Sunday to figure it out,"" Curry said of the Clippers-Rockets Game 7. ""I feel like if we do what we're supposed to do in the next round, we'll be all right."" Marc Gasol led Memphis with 21 points and 15 rebounds. Vince Carter added 16 off the bench, Zach Randolph had 15, Courtney Lee 12 and Conley 11. Curry finished the series with 25 3-pointers, one more than the Grizzlies managed as a team. When he beat the buzzer with that long 3, he celebrated by bumping chests with Iguodala and David Lee. He then added 11 points in the fourth quarter to finish off the Grizzlies. ""It's just one of those special moments,"" Grizzlies guard Tony Allen said of Curry. ""He's a special kind of guy. They make those kind of shots."" That stellar shooting helped the Warriors win a second series in the same postseason for the first time since capturing the title in 1975, and they never trailed in this game. The Warriors outshot, outrebounded and simply did everything better than Memphis early, looking like the team that dominated the NBA regular season. Golden State led 32-19 by the end of the first quarter and Memphis had one more field goal (seven) than the Warriors had 3-pointers (six). The ""Splash Brothers"" outscored the Grizzlies by themselves, combining for 22 points. But Curry and Thompson got plenty of help with teammates taking turns knocking down shots. ""I think what you see with their team is I think that they really grew up,"" Joerger said. ""They really grew through the battle of this series and matured to the point where I think that will help them, unfortunately, in the future being able to take the hits that they took and the physicality that I think we are known for."" Memphis tried to rally, opening the third quarter with a 13-5 spurt with two free throws by Green pulling the Grizzlies within 63-62 with 3:59 left. Green hit a jumper to get them within 65-64 before the Warriors finished the quarter on an 11-4 run capped by Curry's amazing 3. Memphis got within eight with 6:03 left and got no closer as Curry knocked down consecutive 3s. --- TIP-INS  Warriors: Curry had been 0-for-32, 0-of-3 in the playoffs, on shots from the backcourt before his 62-footer. ... The Warriors are 13-7 all time in Game 6s and improved to 9-2 in their past 11. ... They are 54-5 this season and postseason combined when making at least 10 3-pointers, including 7-0 these playoffs. Grizzlies: Allen, who had 24 steals in his first nine playoff games, tried to play with the injured left hamstring that kept him out of Game 5. But he played only 5 minutes before going to the bench for the night, unable to move effectively. ... Memphis had only three turnovers, the fewest ever in a playoff game against Golden State. The Lakers had six on March 31, 1969, against Golden State. ... Memphis is 4-2 all time in Game 6s, losing its past two. REMEMBERING B.B. The Grizzlies played a video tribute and held a moment of silence before the national anthem in memory of musician B.B. King, who died late Thursday at the age of 89. King got his nickname early in his career playing live in Memphis as the ""Beale Street Blues Boy,"" which later was shortened to B.B."
Klay Thompson
KD won 4 scoring titles. The team was always a WCF lock everytime they were healthy and got stopped by injuries. They took out the 67-win Spurs in 6 and were up 3-1 against the Warriors. You really think all of that was because of Durant alone? lol   &gt;Been surrounded with better teammates  There's a difference between playing with good role players and playing with Steph Curry/Klay Thompson/Kyrie Irving/James Harden
You're right if cp3 was healthy it would've been a sweep. He got injured in the 1st quarter of game 1 and he was basically useless and we still beat a full Lakers squad even though we were the ones who were hurt. LA barely made it out of the play-in game after making a miracle comeback against a Klay Thompson-less Golden State.
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut, Leandro Barbosa, Shaun Livingston, Andre Iguodala, Marreese Speights, Festus Ezeli, Ian Clark, Brandon Rush, James Michael Mcadoo, Kevon Looney, Anderson Varejao  and Jason Thompson who got waived midseason."
"I agree with the definition of what a generational talent is, and would reassert my position that placing three players on same team with said generational talent requires nothing more than telling players to score. There is no need for a method for this years Nets team. Barring some unforeseen change, they hang a banner.    The additional conversation of the pre-KD Warriors team is interesting to me. Yes, I would would agree that Steph is and was then a superstar, but you entirely left out 2014-15 All-Star Klay Thompson. The Warriors had the “Big 3” approach prior to KD. Let’s not sell their talent pool short. Also, Draymond is undersized at the 4, much like Barkley in his Suns days, but was also on a tear defensively that led to his 16-17 DPOY trophy. He was also runner-up for DPOY in both 2014-15 and 2015-16. Again, they were an absolutely stacked team.  Again, my conversation was set to show that perhaps there is another shift in the league that will impact the way teams are built and developed. Unfortunately, the harsh truth is that as long as superstar talent teams with multiple All-Stars are successful on winning championships, big names will continue to try and manipulate the league into fitting this format. See Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis.   The other side shows that teams like Portland have tried to maintain their identities, but don’t have anything to show for it. Balanced talent needs solid leadership and good coaching. It is much easier for a GM to win a championship by hollowing out small market teams than to build through development. See again Kawhi Leonard single handedly killing the Spurs."
Or just have MPJ work hard as fuck to become a defensive savant over the offseason.   it worked for klay thompson. dude was a scrub on defense before he asked for training
Klay thompson cannot create his own shot but he was allnba cuz he was an elite defensive player AND an elite 3 point shooter. Mpj needs to learn how to score of the dribble consistently if he wants to be all nba with an average  defense.
Klay Thompson
"Eh, I just hate how so many NBA fans pretend that if the raptors were swapped out, that their franchise would react differently. You see a turnover you cheer, you see it's the most hated player in the NBA on a team trying to win their 4th chip together, you probably get caught up in the moment. If you wanted to push a different narrative you could, I mean KD got chants and a standing ovation on his way out. If raptors fans were just twats we would've cheered the klay thompson injury too.   Obviously I wish it happened differently, but you won't convince me that vast majority of NBA franchises' fans would act differently. Ya'll really think Toronto ball fans are any different from NY ball fans? Or boston? or philly? or miami? All the same shit just different cities"
Get whoever pays for all the Klay Thompson Is Cool awards to do it
"I think you're absolutely wrong to assume that it's as simple as ""more scoring."" Because there is no way the average viewer likes to see three free throws in a row.  When average fans want to see more scoring, they want to see Steph Curry and Klay Thompson hit a million 3s. They want to see Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray duking it out in the playoffs with record numbers of 50 point games.  The average NBA viewer does not want to watch Marcus Morris fall on his ass on purpose and then take three free throws in a row.  It's horrible television."
Zion and Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson or Derrick Rose 😤
"This is hard because of the 1st team SF line up....I wanted to put LeBron, but then there's KD. But LeBron can play any position basically, so imma just put him at PF.   **1st team:**  PG: Steph Curry  SG: James Harden   SF: Kevin Durant  PF: LeBron James  C: Dwight Howard   **2nd team:**  PG: Chris Paul  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Kawhii Leonard  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Marc Gasol  **3rd team:**  PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Paul George  PF: Giannis  C: Joel Embiid"
"I agree. This year they basically have no experience playing together. Next year it's game over, unless the warriors with a 22 ppg and dpoy level defense Klay Thompson can challenge them."
Klay Thompson or Robert Horry
When did Reggie Jackson turn into Klay Thompson?
"He is an inconsistent *scorer*, he still brings it on defense and is a smart player. But his offensive game is all based around jumpers which is why he's streaky.   His man defense has also slipped from what it used to be, but again, he's still a smart player who is a great help defender and makes winning plays.   The PG that we see now is like this weird hybrid of Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala. Which is not good enough offensively to be the #2 on a championship team."
Eh the warriors would not have lost to the raptors if not for the bad injury luck that they had at the end. Raptors get credit for beating the team they faced but no way do they win against a healthy kd and klay Thompson.
"For now.  Locks:  LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Doncic (international ticket), Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard.  Possibly get in:  Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Damian Lillard, Draymond Green (considering how long Rodman and Big Ben get inducted), LaMarcus Aldridge (yeah, just retired), Kawhi Leonard, Rajon Rondo, Joel Embiid, Derrick Rose, Al Horford, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love"

Why leave when you have steph curry Draymond green and Klay Thompson? Or having russel Westbrook and a good supporting cast. Dude just wants super teams
"How? If a team is good at drafting, it's just as unfair to say ""Sorry, Warriors, you were too good at drafting developing players- it's just not FAIR that you have three good stars and these other teams have none. By order of the NBA, you must trade Klay Thompson to the Kings for a second-round pick seven years from now and a bag of basketballs. It's just the neighborly thing to do..."".  Likewise, once a player not only goes past the free agency path, but says ""either you trade for this guy or I go somewhere else"", then it's worse than even just ""I'm leaving for this team, the city's cooler"" and goes to ""kill two teams."""
"Rodman is a very good piece and fit but I don’t consider him to bring them from a great team to a super team  Also he wasn’t All NBA or an All Star  Heat had 3 all stars in 2013 (James, Wade, Bosh)  Warriors had 4 all stars in 2017 (Curry, Thompson, Durant and Green) and 3 all NBA (previous 4 minus Klay)  Nets have 3 all stars (KD, Kyrie and Harden)  Celtics had 3 all stars (KG, Pierce and Allen) with KG being DPOY and Pierce MVP and both All NBA"
Yes 2017 Warriors without Klay would be more dominant than Nets without Harden.   Klay Thompson coasted the 2017 playoffs because of how much better they were than everyone else and Warriors still easily win championship.
"give me Klay Thompson, that mf can shoot for anywhere"
Klay Thompson
"This season as a whole, yes he is.  But he doesn't have enough support and they are grinding him down.  He still has a torn meniscus, and its only a matter of time before he goes down like Klay Thompson.  They won't make it out of this round, and hopefully they can straighten it out in the offseason.    Dump Ben Simmons and his 30 MILLION dollar a year waste, and they could fix this easily.   Someone who shoots 35% FT and gets 4 points in his last game is not worth 30 mil."
"Imagine comparing an all-star team to Steph fucking Curry, Kevin fucking Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green.  Wanna know the accolades between all of them?  * 26x all-star appearances * 6x scoring champ * 10x nba champ * 19x all-nba * 2x finals mvp * 3x mvp * 6x all defensive * 1 dpoy"
Klay Thompson wants to know your location
"Facu is great for us, when he sticks to his role. These past 2 games he's been shooting threes a lot more than his usual volume &amp; it's obvious he's lackluster in that department. If he just sticks to defense &amp; creating plays on the offensive end, we'll be better.  Everyone in general needs to stop just blindly chucking goddamn threes, last time I checked stat sheet never mentions Klay Thompson or Steph playing for Denver."
Klay Thompson
"You most definitely can win with a ""defensive superteam"", but I'm not convinced by OP's lineup. Garnett, Rasheed, Artest, and Stockton or Kidd are the four easy picks for me to suit 2021's game, but I don't know what the rules are, other than picking great defenders who aren't offensive superstars. I'm having difficulty with the fifth though. We can go with Gary Payton, but I don't know that the other four provide enough shooting for his fit. Jerry West, CP3, and Kobe would be a great choice, but they might be too good on offense for a team like this. Klay Thompson would be an incredible fit, but I don't think he's good enough of a defender to hang with those guys.  Perhaps taking both Stockton and Kidd is the answer here, as it also doesn't make the team too loaded.  Anyway, I think this team wins on pure talent, even if the spacing isn't great for today's era. Pluck them two years before their prime and put them in 2019, they're definitely winning the 2021 championship for my money."
"Clarkson gets more of a green light because he can create his own shots at an efficient clip. Ingles is undeniably a better pure shooter, but he doesn't have the speed or handles to be able to consistently create separation or drive by defenders like Clarkson can.  I was trying to think of a comparison, and the closest one I could come up with would be like saying Klay Thompson is a better scorer than James Harden. Like yah, Klay is most definitely a better shooter (he's also a great scorer don't get me wrong), but he is not nearly on the same level of Harden when it comes to speed, handles, finishing, drawing fouls, etc. The difference is night and day, and the disparity between the two is similar for Ingles and Clarkson IMO."
Why does Porter think he is Klay Thompson
"I look at Middleton kind of like Klay Thompson. He's not going to be able to change the game himself most of the time, he needs Giannis to get things going for him to be at his best, but he is a great compliment when the team is actually working."
White klay Thompson without defense
"Ok then where's all of the hate for Klay Thompson for talking shit to LeBron during the finals press conference? Hb Draymond? Westbrook? Tons of players have talked shit off the court, but only Wade and LeBron are still getting shit on a decade later for it, wonder why that is?"
"Delusional Warriors fan ofcourse. There was no body contact and he missed the ball and hit Klay's hand at the rim instead. That's what a personal foul is. Kinda ironic how a Warriors fan is complaining about dirty plays.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF\_zSEbNL0c&amp;ab\_channel=HouseofHighlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF_zSEbNL0c&amp;ab_channel=HouseofHighlights)  Here the warriors players themselves saying that it wasn't a dirty play by Danny Green, just unfortunate. But I'm sure you know better than them ofcourse.  [https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/danny-green-reveals-what-warriors-players-said-after-klay-thompson-injury](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/danny-green-reveals-what-warriors-players-said-after-klay-thompson-injury)"
How many of y’all would take a bet that Klay Thompson comes back and averages over 18ppg next season? What odds would you need for it? 5 to 1?
"I've always thought PG's closest comparison was Klay Thompson. I think if you switch them, they have nearly identical careers. PG is a great 3&amp;D player who was given the keys to a mid-tier playoff team and found fame for it, while Klay has been relegated to ""role player"" despite being very capable himself."
But wait how big is this player? If you give Seth curry matisse thybulles body while keeping all of his offensive ability that damn near might be klay Thompson
Klay Thompson if he played the 4/5
Sounds like Klay Thompson
As Bill Simmons said. Peja was Klay Thompson before Klay Thompson. Peja would annihilate in this era. He was a top 3 MVP candidate one season.
"[This ](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/usg_pct_career.html) is the all time high list for Usg and most of the people I listed are on there, Klay Thompson has a [well above avg/high ](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/klay-thompson-usage-rate-by-season) usg.

Why is Kennard Klay Thompson now
Lebron having a decent teammate in Klay Thompson who he can make better would beat the KD and Curry duo. Cavs in 6.
"Lebron and Klay Thompson would be a fucking insane duo. Warriors defense gets noticeably worse without Klay.  No idea who wins, but it's a lot closer"
If royce O'Neale does not continue to be Klay Thompson after his series against the Grizz I will be very annoyed
Bogi is on Klay Thompson mood
Maybe they were targeting us because they heard Klay Thompson talk about the nice movie theatre near the arena a few years ago and they wanted to go see Spirit Untamed together.
"If your definition of diva is hitting a chair or getting in a teammates face then:   Rondo quitting on the Mavs in the middle of a playoff game, Draymond calling KD a bitch on live TV, Draymond kicking people in the nuts, Klay Thompson says it's a mans game and he got his feelings hurt, then doesn't shake hands after game 7. I can go on and on."
"It’s insane that we had so much talent that Klay Thompson was the 4th most important player.  He is an efficient 20+ a game sniper who provides the second best spacing all time, elite defender, and is the greatest scorer of all time when he gets hot.  When the game is important he elevates his play and he’s as unselfish as Curry.  I try to remember to be humble about how lucky we got drafting Steph, Klay and Dray."
"Hey Klay Thompson, can you send me gold?"
"Klay Thompson is so underrated - he's like the perfect complementary star on a team.   Elite shooter and very solid defender, and doesn't seem to have an ego and is more than willing to be the 2nd or even 3rd option on a team. That's so rare and valuable to have on a team"
Dude really put kyle korver and jj reddick on the same level as klay thompson 😭😭
Klay Thompson is the 2nd best shooter of all time and you're high on crack if you think he isn't
Klay thompson is not the 2nd best shooter of all time and you're high on crack if you think he is
I don’t remember but was ibaka even shooting threes at that time? They honestly played really really good defense that series. Adams really mobile at the time ibaka as well. Still sad that klay Thompson went bananas game 6
"&gt;KD never disrespectful of other baller.  When asked to list the top 5 players he's ever played with he picked Serge Ibaka over Russell Westbrook.  Kyrie Irving  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Serge Ibaka  Serge was on the team when he roasted it with the burner account saying him and Russ were the only good players and ""he couldn't win with those cats.""   KD has absolutely disrespected other ballers."
Man I wonder what Giannis would look like with Kyrie and James Harden. Or even Klay Thompson and Curry.
"People talk about Lebron’s second Cavs stint like he had been there all along. He didn’t build the Cavs organically and just to trade for Kevin Love. He left them to be a lottery team, they drafted a star and then had great assets to build another super team just in time for the Heat to crumble.  Until he got old and the Cavs relegated him to being a spot up shooter, Kevin Love was more valued than Klay Thompson. Love was a bonafide star in Minnesota."
"And somehow people hate Giannis for this, when it's the Bucks front office and coach to blame. Clearly not every big man can shoot like Klay Thompson, or else there would be more than one KD."
"At what point are we going to call this team what it is. The most unfair team in the history of sports. The team that every rule relating to be business of basketball is made to prevent. From salary caps to luxury taxes to trade regulations. At what point are we going to recognize that it's not working and stop this shit. We've had 2 years where one of three super teams hasn't won the championship in the last decade. And one of those was only because half the super team got injured in the finals.   My idea to fix the NBA is this. No team is allowed to add a third all star if the team already has two all stars from the previous two years. If the team has more than 2 all stars but they were already on the team before they were all stars a la Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green that's fine. But we have to stop this bullshit of superstars jumping on bandwagons with other super stars. We obviously can trust superstars to have a backbone and not do it out of sportsmanship. And part of that is because apparantly not enough people care or are willing to admit that the NBA is broken.   TLDR: Every rule in the NBA is made to prevent what has been happening to the NBA ever since KD bandwagoned on the Warriors and has ruined competition and sportsmanship in the NBA every single year but one since then. It's time for the NBA to step up and do something that is destroying competition, sportsmanship and the entire point of the National Basketball Association."
"When has KD taken a bunch of scrubs to a championship lol? His only finals appearances featured *three* of Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Russel Westbrook, James Harden, Klay Thompson, and Surge Ibaka"
Klay Thompson kicking it behind those kids.
"Literally nobody says it’s only cause of that, but you’re silly if you think having the best shooter of all time on your team along with the 2nd-3rd best in Klay Thompson doesn’t help you get wide open looks"
want a spicy one? here it is  Klay Thompson is just an average defender during his peak will be a liability to Steph once he comes back
Of course he can :)  PG: Damian Lilliard  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Serge Ibaka  C: Deandre Ayton
He's pretty much the prototypical 3 &amp; D guy in the NBA right now.   I don't see anyone being better than him in that regard other than a healthy Klay Thompson.
"Devin Booker, Klay Thompson, and Squidward's house all need to form their own super team."
I like to challenge that thought. Would you take prime harden or Klay Thompson next to Prime LeBron?
Lack of a handle and self-creation are specifically what stop him from being a true star player. He's a phenomenal shooter and overall scorer but he's closer to Klay Thompson than Kevin Durant.
Mikal Bridges is the next Klay Thompson
I been watching him. Ur just ignorant if u don't think he's underrated. Some people claim klay thompson is the second best shooter of all time. But people never mention joe harris when talking best shooter of all tim.e
Klay Thompson is also a plus defender and can create off the dribble which Joe can't don't compare the 2.
Crowder has literally been Klay Thompson ever since Lebron clowned him
only to run into Klay Thompson
"Right. I mean, look at Klay Thompson.  You think he doesn't doubt he'll be the same player again?"
Joe Harris is basically the Nets Klay Thompson

Maybe someone like klay Thompson? It will never happen but he would need a star like that.
Lol discount Klay Thompson 💀
Marcus Morris turning into Klay Thompson on offense really helped with that
&gt; Olay Thompson  if Klay was a bullfighter.
"For starters, play the starters 40+ mins   2nd -  Either double team Kyrie or KD and hope discount Klay Thompson doesn't go nuclear.. If they can't win with Harden out, they probably will not win at all"
Klay Thompson &gt; Steph Curry
I was expecting that star struck reaction we all imagine where the second you see him your whole body turns with your head and you proceed to piss all over him. You quickly realize what you’re doing and try to deflect your stream and end up getting piss in your own mouth. Klay Thompson starts dry reaching from the smell of your asparagus piss on him and the piss you’ve just casually swallowed before abruptly slipping in your dank piss puddle and injuring himself. The warriors miss the playoffs. Classic.
"&gt; CJ? Lmao, no. Realistically I can see Poole as a more athletic, better ball handling/dribbling Klay Thompson.  The idea that you think CJ is better than pre-injury Klay is weird as hell."
"If you’re shooting 38% from 3 on over 7 attempts a game, you’re a great 3 point shooter regardless of how streaky you are. Klay Thompson is all people is one of the most streaky shooters in the league."
"I was pissing in a urinal in an airport in southern Cali and Klay Thompson walked up and started peeing in the urinal next to me. I looked over and said ""ah shit you're Klay Thompson"" and he said ""yup"" and walked out without washing his hands. Not really a story like the prompt but its what I got.   &amp;#x200B;  I met Shaq when I was a kid here in phx. My dad got us seats to a Dbacks game and I started complaining I couldnt see because the guy innfront of me and he turned around and laughed. We compared hand sizes"
that's not Jordan poole that's Klay Thompson
He was consistently cutting with the Rockets and of course he doesn’t set screens. Not every guard has to be Steph Curry without the basketball.   Plenty of players at all perimeter positions who can’t shoot and are effective without suddenly becoming Klay Thompson without the ball
Klay Thompson &gt; Reggie Miller  I don’t even remember why I thought this years ago
Guaranteed to be favorites? Prime Klay Thompson. His off-ball shooting can work well with our Durant-lite in Ingram and our (Curry+Draymond)/2 in Zion.

"Morey: ""Hey Bob, I've got the Blazers ready to give me 3 firsts, 3 swaps, and CJ McCollum for Ben Simmons.  But you guys can have him with this special limited time offer for Klay Thompson, 4 firsts, and 3 swaps!  Whatdyasay Bob? We gotta deal?"""
Because that's not the only thing he said. It would be perfectly fine if he made his Dame all star case without having to criticize another player's selection to do it. Most of the segment was him downplaying Klay Thompson.
"The amount of lists that have Scottie Pippen over Kevin Garnett, Giannis, D Wade, Dirk, and David Robinson is disgusting. Definitely the most overrated player of all time at this point.  Putting Scottie over David Robinson is especially funny because they played at the exact same time and in their primes their exact same time. You know how people boast that Scottie was so good in 94 that he was 3rd in MVP voting and won 54 games averaging 24/6/7...well guess who the actual MVP was that year? It was Robinson putting up a monster 29/13/5/4 on a 60+ win Spurs team.  Pippen over Robinson is like someone in the future taking Klay Thompson over Giannis today. Ridiculous"

"No not him, Klay Thompson   jk thanks I forgot his name lol"
 &gt;Trey Murphy is basically 6’8 klay Thompson  He said overreact
It doesnt matter enough to claim those guys are the most skilled ever. Are Klay Thompson or Ray Allen more skilled than Dwyane Wade? Best 3 point shooting guards vs shooting guard who doesnt shoot 3s at all?
"I think the incentive to be great also probably isn't there. When you grow up like a lot of star players grow up the focus and drive to elevate to another level is different, because they are their families way out of a tough situation (obviously not always the case) but then the sons come along and the doors their father opened up for them doesn't strictly point to the profession their father's excelled in. But the son's who choose that path probably don't love the grind the father's did.Thus the role player mentality is instilled. The only off the top of my head that's exceeded their father in basketball is Klay Thompson."

"[Golden State’s Klay Thompson has suffered a torn ACL in his left knee, his agent Greg Lawrence tells ESPN.](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1139404947940765698?lang=en)"
"This seems to have flaws that work to LeBron's benefit. For example, Love was an all-star in 2017 and 2018, so LeBron's numbers should reflect when both he and Kyrie were off, not just Kyrie. Klay Thompson was not an all-star in the first 2 years you're counting for Curry (and didn't even play in 2020 and '21), and Draymond was not for the first 3. I don't know if there are similar inconsistencies elsewhere."
The Kevin Love for Klay Thompson trade that almost happened in 2014. The trade was so close that on ESPN it was breaking news that the Warriors and Timberwolves had an agreement in principle. Until the Great Jerry West stepped in and said nah. The trade fell through after
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9.

Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
Evan Mobley needs to demand out of Cleveland   Scottie Barnes is basically LeBron James but high off crack   Giddey is the best Australian player in the League  Bouknight is a future scoring leader   Jalen Green is a Bust   Cade is ducking NBA comp   Brandon Boston is an Elite chucker  Davion Mitchell DPOY potential   Alperen Sengun is white Tim Duncan   Josh Primo is the coldest middle schooler the league has ever seen   Josh Christopher is the best shooter in the NBA   Trey Murphy is basically 6’8 klay Thompson   Franz Wagner is a bust  Justin Champaigne is the next Dennis Rodman   Cam Thomas has goat potential.   Chris Duarte is pretty good for a senior citizen
But he told Klay Thompson that he’s a bich! Jk his defense ain’t bad. I do find defense first white players to be more rare in the league typically
Drummond has a higher career Win Shares than Klay Thompson. Clearly built different
Wasn't he the guy who tried to run Klay Thompson ISOs or something
"Surely, CWebb and TMac should be there?  Grant Hill most definitely needs to be in this as well.  We can remove Klay Thompson, Chris Bosh, and Tony Parker."
… this is without Klay Thompson.
Steph Curry   Michael Mulder   Jordan Poole   Klay Thompson   Chris Chiozza
Bro if he becomes Klay Thompson the Pels are Gucci hahaha
"Because giving a max contract to a player who literally cannot create his own shot rarely ever works out  In fact the only guys like that in the entire NBA are Rudy Gobert and Klay Thompson, and one is a generational defender and the other a generational shooter   Ayton is neither of those things"
"It’s because he’s older than the rest of the lottery picks and he was seen as someone who can only shoot 3s. Plus, teams want players that can develop into franchise stars whereas TM3’s ceiling is basically Klay Thompson"
Klay Thompson
"Playoff scoring peaks for the three guys:  Reggie Miller '92-'01 (96 games): 33.4 points/100, +9.5 rTS  Ray Allen '99-'08 (63 games): 29.1 points/100, +8.0 rTS  Klay Thompson '14-'16 (52 games): 29.3 points/100, +3.5 rTS  I'm so confused at this thread"
"Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, and KD"
"Miller &gt; Allen &gt; Thompson. Klay's obviously a fantastic shooter, but he doesn't have to make his own shot as much as Allen and Miller did. Allen and Miller were both the ""guy"" on a team, made their own shots, and consistently averaged more points than Klay while having the benefit of playing with the greatest shooter of all time. Miller played shooting guard, and put a fight against the greatest shooting guard, offensively and defensively, of all time."
"Yup. Klay Thompson shot 30% and 35% in the 2015 and 2016 Finals.   On the Lakers, he would have been ran out of town for performances like that.   Just look at what happened to Danny Green."
"That series and finals  is one of the best examples of how superstars get held to completely different standards and how Klay has one of the best jobs in the NBA.   Game 6 Klay: 41/4/0 on 14/31 and HUGE shots , +16. Deserved legendary status.   Game 6 Steph: 31/10/9 on 9/22, +12.   Game 7 Klay: 21/5/0 on 7/19, -2.   Game 7 Steph: 36/8/5 on 13/24, +18.  Next closest Warriors starter was +3.   The way people talk about this series you’d think a game 7 wasn’t even played, and this is a game where the Warriors trailed at halftime and points were hard to come by. People act like Klay singlehandedly won game 6. It’s not uncommon to hear the phrase “Klay Thompson changed the entire trajectory of the NBA” on this sub.  Meanwhile if you talk about the 16 finals Klay only gets brought up for not shaking hands rather than his play, he’s definitely one of the most fortunate players in the league in terms of credit to blame ratios."
"Imagine a big three of him, Paul George, and Klay Thompson  Either win by 40 or lose by 40 every game"
"This comment will be a great test to see if Rudy Gobert has a burner account from which he doles out Reddit awards the way Klay Thompson does.  Gobert might quite literally become the MVP overnight if the NBA removed the 3 second rule.  Edit: not a serious prediction, btw, and I know I have homer glasses, but I do think the odds would jump from something like 0.5% to 5-10%."
"""When you're on a bad team you don't have Klay Thompson on this side or Livingston on this side...""  Oh you mean like last year lol.  I feel like once a month we get a Steph Curry crazy disrespect thread but then we also get a bunch of people who don't understand why people say Steph Curry still gets a ton of disrespect."
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"Holy cap all around. If Curry was a better midrange shooter, he would take more, but he chooses to limit himself.    &gt;Closed out the Harden + CP3 Rockets in game 6  That’s not the finals.   &gt;Also his game 7 vs OKC is conveniently forgotten  Klay Thompson had the luckiest game of his career in game 6 to even force game 7. Seems like you forgot that. And once again, that’s not the finals. What happened when he blew that 3-1 lead?"
"I don't get the Warriors being contenders at all, it's basically the same team as last year but around Christmas they get a Klay Thompson that hasn't played in 2 years"

All you’re proving rn is that you have no sense of NBA trade value. No team is taking their chances on whats likely to be the shell of Klay Thompson on max deal for the 2nd pick of what was seen to be a weak draft. The Warriors would have to receive an all star also to maintain contender status also….what team is trading their all-star for that? Klay has had the worst contract in the NBA the last 2 seasons…GSW couldn’t move him if they tried
No you wouldn’t have. Nobody’s trading for a post-Achilles and ACL injury Klay Thompson with that contract of his. No GM in the league is picking that call up. The Warriors couldn’t have traded him if they tried.
you would’ve traded away what looked to be a healthy Klay Thompson? That’s bullshit. And even then how is that Curry’s fault that Klay got injured again? I don’t understand where that part of your comment is coming from? Thats just ridiculous
Klay Thompson too.   Was surprised to see him at 37. Not agreeing or disagreeing just didn't expect any lists to be sans-injury.
"Honestly don't see why everyone is so high on the heat, they give off the same energy as everyone locking in the warriors this year as a contender because Klay (who hasn't played an NBA game for 2 years) Thompson is back Dec/Jan."
"The entire bet of the Warriors being a contender will and will be until Christmas, and possibly even after, is the question of one Klay Thompson"
"I remember some guy the Blazers drafted in the 2nd round but never played a game hitting 80+ threes in a row without breaking a sweat.  In my observation, it goes to show you just how good NBA players are and also, that it takes more than being able to shoot well in an empty gym.  By default, I'm willing to bet there are many 'pure shooters' that could outshoot the majority of NBA starters.  But it takes more than just shooting well in an open gym.  Game shooting =/= practice shooting.  Otherwise, someone like Ben McClemore would probably be as great as Klay Thompson."
His shooting is demonstrably not as good as it ever has been and he’s never matched the extreme efficiency from three of his 2016 season since. It’s still better than everyone else but that doesn’t make it the same.  It’s still a ridiculous argument to begin with even if we’re pretending he’s still that guy but Klay Thompson  and a decent bench is the difference between the best regular season team of all time and squeezing into an 8th seed. 2021 Giannis played better in the playoffs than 2016 Curry did and given how wildly different their games are you’d be foolish to say it’s crazy to take an interior and defensive threat the level of Giannis over a shooting threat the level of Curry like PPG and shooting splits are the only thing that matter.
Warriors shouldn’t be anywhere near top 5.   A Klay Thompson that hasn’t played an nba game in 2 years isn’t the difference between missing the playoffs and being a top 5 team in the league.
"&gt; but if you look around the league and who wins championships, the part that teams struggle with is getting the superstar  No it isn't.  The part that teams struggle with is putting a good enough roster around that superstar to have a shot at a ring.  That's why the Cavs couldn't even get there with LeBron goddamn James the first time around. Why the Rockets never won a championship with James Harden, why the Thunder couldn't do it when they had Durant.  The Warriors got their first (in recent memory) with Steph Curry AND Klay Thompson AND Draymond Green and an extremely fucking solid roster all the way down.  Having ""a superstar"" isn't enough."
"It took Steph averaging 37 points for a whole month for them to still miss the playoffs.  So Klay Thompson coming back with major rust is the difference between them missing the postseason and having homecourt advantage?  I don't get it.  Even people who come back from ACL tears typically take a season to get their feet back, and that's not even Klay's worst injury."
Curry almost carried them alone to a playoff spot and I'll never doubt Klay Thompson
"I think the inclination is to pick a big strong guy because of tug of war, but the bigger you are, the bigger your mouth is usually, which could be problematic for the cookie game where you need small precise bites. So I want a guard.   You also need someone who thrives under pressure, as well as someone super likeable so that he does not get murdered by the others.  Give me Klay Thompson."
"You're forgetting one of the best shooters of all time in your rankings, in terms of efficiency (Steve Nash).   I'm pretty sure Nash and Bird are the only players in NBA history to have multiple 50/40/90 seasons.   My list:   1. Steph Curry 2. Steve Nash 3. Larry Bird 4. Klay Thompson 5. Kevin Durant"
It may have been but I still argue that's too simplistic. He is an NBA player with an NBA career. Do you think Giannis would be OK cutting his career short right now if the money was the same? Of course not. They are still competitors who play a sport at the highest level. Sure. The money is great. But it's silly to act like they're all out here playing for money. Yes. Money is a huge part but Klay Thompson is still getting paid his full MAX contract whether he plays or not this season. What do you think he's going to do?
"Klay Thompson? The guy who scored 60 with 8 dribbles, the guy who dropped 46 to save warriors from losing. Cmon bro there’s no way u sayin he was better than Klay Thompson"
"Porzingis. Needs to show he can have an all star season again.   Kemba. I want him so badly to show he’s still a star.   Brandon Ingram, went from all star to a pretty lack luster season, need to see if he’s truly going to be a long term piece to work next to Zion and make a contender.  And I don’t know if this fits with the theme but Klay Thompson. It’s been 2 years and I really think everyone just wants to see him succeed."
"So Klay Thompson is better than Barkley was, that's what you're telling me?"
Klay Thompson. Coming back after 2 years off and pretty serious injuries.
"Klay Thompson - 139 games missed (and still going), 31 years old  ...and that's only for the last two years, not five. Before then he was almost never out, as most people here know.  Those 5 dudes, btw, missing so many games, is insane. We, as fans, should really demand the league make more changes to the schedule, to ease the load, for instance by cutting the season to 72 games permanently. Yes, you are missing 10 games per team, but when your top talent is sitting out the whole season anyway, is it really worth it? They must have some data on ratings amd general engagement.  Injuries shouldn't be a knock on players, it should be on the league (somewhat), and I get that it's a sport where injuries happen."
"When Steph “choker” Curry, Kevin “snake” Durant, Klay “role player” Thompson and Dray mond “triple single” Green go 16-1 in the playoffs but are all trash"
You take a talented team and push it to the top. You don’t want Klay Thompson as your best player but as the second or third best guy you’d love him
Bro the fact that Klay Thompson hasn't played in two years is all you need
Klay Thompson is the most overrated player in NBA history.
"Yea, and I don't even think this is obvious:  &gt; Obviously, Kyrie is a better overall player than Klay Thompson  Kyrie is a better #1 option than Klay, but Klay is a better team player. Good off-ball and a much, much better defender. Kyrie just has the flashier game with the handles and scoring.   Kyrie can do some damage when he's locked in (he was awesome in the 2016 Finals), but overall I think I'd rather have Klay on most teams."
"silly. It's still 2 pts in a game where the average score is 100+ per team. The most exciting play in all of sports? lol.  &amp;#x200B;  More than a bicycle kick in soccer? Someone breaking an arm in MMA? A knockout haymaker in boxing?   &amp;#x200B;  I don't care about dunking. It's great but it's not necessary and I'll watch basketball with no dunking for sure and so will a lot of purists, as people that actually love the game will watch, say, elementary school basketball.  &amp;#x200B;  My favorite player is Klay Thompson because I feel like he's just captured pure efficiency and fundamentals, and his play is aspirational to everyone of every age because I feel like everyone can learn something about the game just watching him play. I don't care if he never dunks in an NBA game again."
"And there wont be a single team anytine soon. With guys like Embiid, Jokic, Giannis, AD, KAT and more all active in the league right now, you can't go small ball without steph curry and klay Thompson in prime form on your team. What team is shooting good enough to run those players off the court? No one"
"""I guess he got his feelings hurt""-klay thompson"
"If we are talking about chips , you refuse to take into account level of competition . LeBron had harder competition   San Antonio Spurs with Greg Popovich, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Kawhi Leonard. There's 5 hall of famers right there and LeBron had to face them 3 times. The first year, he had Boobie Gibson as his second best player haha. Golden State Warriors with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Kevin Durant (for 2 years). LeBron had to face them 4 times. The first year he lost Kyrie and Love for the whole series. The second year, Warriors went 73-9 (all-time record) and was down 3-1 for the biggest comeback in the history of sports. Third and fourth year, that 73-9 team added Kevin Durant. One of those years, he had to face the Thunder that had Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Ibaka and then the only team he was favored to beat that he lost to, was Dallas Mavericks, who collectively outperformed the predictions by beating Portland, sweeping past champion Lakers, and beating OKC who had Durant, Westbrook, Harden."
Replace Bam and Capela with prime Lebron and MJ and Andre Drummond with Klay Thompson or something.
"I’d say you should study up a bit on the last few years of the Lakers, Sixers, Clippers, Nets and Warriors. Those teams seem to involve the lead up to most of what you’ll find as the current major “story lines”. They are all contenders this year with the exception of GS (and likely the Sixers), but GS is interesting because of the return of Klay Thompson after 2 seasons (and Curry being Curry) and the Sixers because of the Ben Simmons situation. That’s an oversimplification but it’s a good starting point."
"Melo is definitely too high, I'd add Klay Thompson over him, Kidd aswell even as a Mavs fan. Ginobli would have to be on the list aswell I'd definitely have him over for example Bosh."
"That's why I said ""potentially Klay like shooting"" instead of ""exactly like Klay"". Obviously he's not Klay Thompson, and probably never will be.   He's a 23 year old volume 3pt shooter who plays above average defense and rebounds well. He's a shite passer right now but his defense is improving each season. Denver is a fringe small market team and they are in full on win now mode. MPJ is the player that turns that team from solid playoff team to full on contender imo (assuming jamal comes back without any issues)."

We need Klay Thompson to hang out with the Diaz Brothers
"I respect Embiid for being openly honest.  He did improve his game, immensely and to know the Ben can't even attempt jump shots is a slap in the face. They're not asking you to become Klay Thompson.  Giannis isn't a great shooter but you know what, he can air ball a 3pt shot...hear the whole arena clap...then come back down and shot another one. It's just the threat of him being **willing** to take the shot. Ben is the type that once he hears the truth he goes to his room and slams the door."
"I think the Bucks chances of repeating aren’t very high but crazier things have happened.  As for who is coming out of the west I think it’s a lot more open than people think it is.  Realistically the Lakers are only getting 25-30 games with all three of Bron, Russ, and AD on the court together at the same time.  When you couple that with the facts of GSW getting Klay Thompson back, PHX running it back with a year of experience making a deep playoff run, and DEN is getting Murray back at some point the West is going to be a dogfight."
There’s that video of a reporter not knowing who Klay Thompson is while interviewing him. Klay is like what 6’5? Not reacting or noticing to 6’11 Giannis seems really unlikely.
"Klay Thompson did LeBron James a HUUGE favor, by providing him with the ""Killer Gene"", the ""Killer Mentality"", that The Frozen One has shown, time and time again, he doesn't possess.  You know it, and I know it"
"Klay Thompson and Damian Lillard were picked immediately after Fredette and Robinson too... Kings could've been in contention with a lineup of Dame, Klay, Gay, Williams, Cousins.  Or they could have got Klay and Kawhi and had Tyreke, Klay, Kawhi, Rudy, Boogie."
They also passed on Klay Thompson in the 2011 draft.
"* Tatum, both are very good but I expect Brown to be who he was last year while Tatum becomes more consistent and improves on the playmaking flashes he's shown.  * Don't see any of them really improving, more playing in the same role they had. I'll go Nunn, because I think he's a more consistent and less ball-dominant player than Monk, and I think that off-ball scoring will be very valuable to the Lakers.  * Maxey, I think Thybulle is who he is- great defender but offensive nonfactor. Maxey is much more of a young, developmental prospect, and he'll likely see more minutes as a PG/playmaker with Ben out.  * Brooks, I think Clarke is buried in the rotation and Brooks really stepped it up (particularly defensively) last season.  * Huerter, played a big role in a playoff series and he'll likely split minutes with Bogi and LouWill- the only two players on the Hawks who are really SGs, and I expect Lou/Cooper to avoid sharing the floor with Trae for defensive purposes. Reddish has shown a lot less and is competing with Hunter/Gallo/Collins/Bogi for a spot as a SF/PF.  * Miles took a huge leap last with Hayward out, and his efficiency was through the roof last year, but I'm going with PJ. He experienced the classic sophomore slump on offensive, but his defense was still very good. I think he'll follow the trend of players who re-find their footing in their third year, after they're accustomed to the league a bit.  * Bones, he'll be a legit rotation guy and showed out in college and Summer League. Bol still doesn't have a defined role or NBA skillset and he's buried in the rotation.  * Hayes. I loved Hayes coming out of the draft but he's been an appalling NBA player who is good at basically nothing. That means he basically has nowhere to go but up, even if Bey is still the better player. He'll probably get better with a whole season and no injuries, but I think he's gonna be a four to five year project kind of guy if he even sticks in the league. I think Bey's minutes are gonna be eaten into with Cade/Grant occupying a similar role, and I think Hayes almost has to get better, while Bey will slowly refine the things he's already good at- I think he'll develop like his Villanova peer Mikal Bridges, pretty good as a rookie and slowly refining that 3&amp;D skillset until he becomes really good within that niche.  * KPJ, I think Wood is who is and won't take much of a leap. This was KPJ's first year as a PG and he looked promising, I expect him to be a better at playmaking with some experience. Wood is probably still the better play, but with less change in his game.  * Herro, another guy who I think had a sophomore slump but is still a valuable player, even last year he was a solid off-ball guy and actually averaged a higher PPG than Duncan, albeit on much worse efficiency. Herro is also a better playmaker than Duncan, and much younger. Duncan could still be the better player, but I doubt he changes much in his age-27 season, while Herro has a bit more room to grow.  * Both made a big jump last year, and I think this year will be becoming slightly better versions of themselves, instead of another big jump. RJ's shot has really dramatically improved, and I think he'll get slightly better in that area even if he experiences a dip in raw numbers (for example, going from 40% three-point shooting to 38%, but doing so on more attempts per game). I'll go RJ because of the leap from rookie to sophomore, and I think he has a higher defensive ceiling than Randle. I also expect some of Randle's heavy usage to be eaten into by Kemba/Rose, hurting his raw numbers even if he's just as valuable.  * Mann, Winslow has basically taken a Klay Thompson-length break from basketball.  * Walker, I'm very low on Hayes and his fit beside Zion is questionable, plus he has JV ahead of him. The Pelicans backcourt is seemingly an open race, and NAW seems the most likely guy to take that SG spot.  * Pat, I think Lonzo is who he is (which is a very valuable player) but I don't see him developing into a star. Pat looked like a man amongst boys in Summer League and I think he increases his three-point volume; he shot efficiently last year, but on very few attempts. And, on a roster with Lavine/Demar/Vooch, PatWill is gonna be expected to be a go-to defensive stopper, another area he's shown promise in- clearly the Bulls trust him to reach that promise.  * I'll stand with Ant here. I'm not sure what role D'Lo has on the Wolves; he's a poor defender, has below-average efficiency, and is fairly ball-dominant. He's not an astoundingly great playmaker either. I think he's actually better suited to a sixth man role, and he did play in that role some last season. I don't think Edwards back-half a season was a fluke, guy was legitimately great with Finch coaching and KAT alongside him, plus he should take the rookie to sophomore defensive jump; he's a hard worker and has all the physical attributes of a great defender."
Dude in them thumbnail looks a bit like Klay Thompson.
If you’re going young I’d say Zion Williamson. If you’re going worse vet I’d be really interested in seeing a team built around a healthy Klay Thompson.
"It being a partial tear is irrelevant, the surgery to repair it is the same. Yes, nobody knows exactly when he'll be back, but generally that takes a year to recover.

The most anyone has said about it is they don't know when he'll be back. Maybe he surprises everyone and comes back early, but he's never been known as particularly quick healer."
"All stars play badly sometimes. Look at klay Thompson and Russell Westbrook. You’re just diminishing them to prop up Giannis. He won in the most injury plagued year in league history. He’s a great player, all time top 25 but let’s not overreact from a very strange playoff run"
flat earth beliefs doesn’t equate to kye working for and being popular amongst the league. this is still the same dude who helped grab Klay Thompson from a scary fall in the heat of a finals game
"Do you thinkbthat itnis inappropriate for a NBA reporter to ask, say, Klay Thompson how his injury rehab is going? Or to ask a player or coach the for an injury update to know if a player will be available to play the next game?"
"I've flaired up on this sub like five times and it keeps removing for some dumbass reason. It's a Klay Thompson flair. I'm not afraid of you making fun of the team I like. I'm just sick of every comment section being full of Sixers fans acting like Ben Simmons is a violent criminal who molested their family members. And the Doc apologists are fucking ridiculous too. He was dogshit in the playoffs as he always is, and he completely threw all the blame directly at Simmons. He both destroyed any remaining chemistry between Ben and the team, while also sabotaging his trade value even worse than it was."

"These aren't robots. The assumption that Leonard will be 100% and ready to contend in 6 months is crazy.  &amp;#x200B;  Zach Lavine took 11 months.  &amp;#x200B;  Klay Thompson tore it during the finals and was by all reports ready to go after missing one season. That's more than a year (a whole NBA season plus 2 off-seasons).  &amp;#x200B;  Yes, there have been players who return after 6 months, but generally they struggle to get back to peak or even good performance, and who here thinks that Leonard will return early? He has shown throughout his career a reticence to play when he isn't 100%."
"Klay Thompson is not one of the best scorers in the league though, which is the whole point."
"If you search ""hardwood houdini curry"" on google and click the link under Top Stories, you can still get it.  Here's the text   ``` Boston Celtics: How recent moves point to Cs signing Stephen Curry  After a quiet draft, the Boston Celtics had one of their most active offseason days in a long time, acquiring Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a second-round pick for Tristan Thompson and their remaining Gordon Hayward Traded Player Exception.  The two deals signaled two things — Brad intends to keep the Boston Celtics competitive with a good defense but is also looking towards next summer when the Cs can create a max slot if they move some money around.  Bradley Beal looks likely to be staying another year with the Washington Wizards despite them trading his co-star, Russell Westbrook, and the team headed towards a struggle to make the play-in.  One could logically assume Beal is out of his mind to waste another year of his career confined in Washington D.C., but some things on the outside are controlling his decision-making.  Jayson Tatum, a long-time friend of Beal’s, must have convinced him to stay during his days of contemplating putting in a trade request.  Boston was not going to trade Jaylen Brown for Bradley Beal, so the two St. Louis natives needed to work out a way to play together while not requiring the front office to give up its young star.  The 28-year-old scoring superstar has a player option in the summer of 2022, which he will likely opt-out of to enter free agency as the Wizards embrace a rebuild.  The market for Beal will be a competitive one, but the Boston Celtics have stacked the deck to their favor with just one card: Jayson Tatum.  The two’s friendship has been well-documented, and their dream of playing together has been well known. Next summer, they can make their dream come true, and all of Boston has to do is move some money around to create a $34.1 million max slot.  That’s why Brad Stevens is taking on many expiring deals to make creating that max slot even easier.  The other target the Boston Celtics should prioritize is Stephen Curry.  The all-time great point guard and best shooter in league history looks to be on track to forgo an extension with Golden State and find a new club to support his talents.  Although the Warriors have a fantastic track record of building highly efficient and talented teams, their management has struggled to put a team like that around Steph Curry since the departure of Kevin Durant.  Part of this struggle can be placed on bad luck, like Klay Thompson’s injury scaring away potential free agents, but for the most part, Golden State has failed to be aggressive and make moves to win now.  Their draft speaks to that, utilizing both of their lottery picks instead of trading them for some experienced help and using their highest pick on the biggest project in the draft, Jonathan Kaminga.  There’s still time for the Warriors to make moves in free agency and trade for some veteran support, but nothing Golden State has done in the past year indicates they’ll do that, which could lead to Curry leaving and the franchise having to embrace a rebuild.  The Boston Celtics are arguably the best suitor in the league for Steph Curry.  They have two young but postseason experienced stars with a solid defense in place and a front office that’s intent on winning soon.  Steph Curry’s fit next to the Jays should not have to be explained, but to give you a quick idea of what he’ll provide, the Boston Celtics will have the best spacing possibly in league history.  They’ll have the best offense in league with a top 10 defense, which will directly equate to high-level playoff success.  If the Boston Celtics have any chance at Stephen Curry next summer, they need to take a swing.  ```"
"&gt; MPJ can shoot offball. Thats literally it.  Through his age-22 season, Klay Thompson shot 40.6% from three on 5.4 attempts/game.   Through his age-22 season, Michael Porter Jr shot 43.9% on from three 4.6 attempts/game.   He might never be as good as a guy like Klay wound up becoming but it's 2021, you pay for shooting. MPJ is also an unbelievably good finisher around the rim, shot 84% from 0-3 feet last season, so let's not pretend like he's a Duncan Robinson style specialist, he's got legit game."
Reminds me of a scorching hot Klay Thompson. Obviously some different skillsets Booker possesses i.e. handling the ball. But when they start making them it's like defense doesn't matter and they can make a shot from literally anywhere on the floor. Klay's 62 and Booker's 70 point games they both maybe could've reached Kobe's 82. Plus they kind of resemble one another to me.
golden state had no problem paying klay thompson 70 mil for 2 years of rehab. they will have no issues paying steph at 38 lol
"Portlands defensive problems stemmed more from Melo/Kanter than CJ.  When they hit WCF 3 seasons ago they had the 6th best defense in the league.  CJ clogging up ball movement isn't quite accurate either, his catch and shoot percentages and usage this year are peak klay thompson levels.  He actually had his best season ever last year, just a poor playoff showing.  Most advanced stats that take defense into account show CJ has a larger impact on the game than Ben Simmons (real+/-, WS48, RAPTOR, LEBRON, i hate all these names but they all show a trend).  I don't think trading CJ is addition by subtraction at all, just that they can over-all better balance the roster by trading him for a position that they're weak at.  Powell makes him a bit more expendable, but if they have to run Powell at SF they're in for a rude awakening..."
"Yeah this has been the actual problem with CJ trades.  He's worth more to us than he would be to anyone else.  He's a very good offensive player at a position where there are a bunch of very good offensive players and he isn't good on defense.  Very hard to flip him for what we actually need- Klay Thompson, small forward, or really any star player 3-5."
"Ok fair enough, i guess its just hard for me to believe that someone like Trae Young could have better playmaking data than Joker or Lebron but ill concede this point. We’ll assume Russ is definitely a better passer  Im more so referring to things that may not traditionally be though of as playmaking but actually go a long way in terms of creating high efficiency offense. For example when defenses sag off of russ in the half court he often does nothing off of the ball in order to punish them for doing so, compare that to a guy like Draymond who will immediately set a screen for Steph Curry or Klay Thompson which generates high efficiency offense for high level shot makers. That is nothing but IQ/ the ability to read and react, Lowry off of the ball is able to generate scoring chances whether it be through his ability to occupy defenses by setting off ball screen or coming off of screens himself it leads to easier shots for his teammates   Decision making is more straightforward and this is something Westbrook definitely struggles with as even the creator of bball index([Cranjis](https://streamable.com/r993d2)) directly went out of his to point out  I think if we go back to 19-20 where both players were on legit playoff teams, you can [clearly ](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612761&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=200768,1627783) [see](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612745&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=201935,201566)on/off numbers skew heavily in Lowry’s direction especially during the [postseason ](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612761&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=200768,1627783). Westbrooks numbers were relatively [unimpressive ](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612745&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=201935,201566)   I think Lowry eclipses russ in too many categories for it to be a toss up imo"
"The Golden State Warriors are the perfect team for a Leeds United fan. First of all, both teams have gold and blue as their colors. This means you can be aesthetically consistent in the clubs you support. Also Leeds United gear can double as Warriors gear because they’re the same colors.     Theres also an interesting San Francisco connection between the clubs. The San Francisco 49ers (NFL) own 37% of Leeds United and the Warriors are also based in San Francisco. This would be an interesting thread of continuity between teams you support.    In terms of basketball, the Warriors have one of the most entertaining players of all time in Steph Curry. This is a great time to become a Warriors fan because they’re coming off a disappointing season where they missed the playoffs (so you wouldn’t be glory chasing), but are in a solid position to bounce back with one of their best players in Klay Thompson returning after missing two entire seasons with injuries.    Speaking of Klay, he’s also a very exciting player to watch and has one of the hottest hands in the league. He holds the NBA record for most points in a quarter with 37. Make sure to watch a video of that if you haven’t seen it already. He’s also an interesting personality off the court (look up Klay on a boat).    Finally, the Warriors are a solid team to root for because they have a mix of veteran players and young promising players. Their core is getting up there in age and has a few more seasons to contend for a championship before they pass the torch to guys like James Wiseman and Jonathan Kuminga. This mix of talent means that the Warriors can be competitive for many years to come."
"The Warriors again don't make the postseason next season. Curry has another superstar season, but it isn't enough to carry an overweight Warriors team. Declining Draymond Green, 2 career altering injuries Klay Thompson, and their low quality bench are the primary reasons why."
"Idk man a healthy klay thompson would go a long way. I realize that’s a tall order but this team was a few games from the 5 seed last year, they already look like they’re going to be deeper in a weaker conference imo.  Sooo. Fingers crossed!"
Ngl hated the 2PG with a SG fit. Gotten more into it with a Dame/Curry/Thompson lineup. But I’d want to keep Wiggins for his defense/shooting. Liked the deal as we got a young player with potential and a very valuable pick. Expected it to be higher than 7. The defense would be great with Siakam but I am worried how a Siakam/Green combo playing most of the game will rebound against teams like the Lakers. Also concerned at the hole Siakam would create at SF but I feel that can be fixed. Problem with Dame/Beal is they move Klay to SF and I am worried about his defense coming off the Achilles
Klay Thompson comes back like Kobe after the injuries and his career will fizzle away....
No they were not a super team. A superstar and a really good player don’t make a super team. There’s not a single nba team where klay Thompson would be their best player. A super team IMO consists of a team where 2 or more players would definitely be the best player on that team. Name one team were Middleton would become the clear number 1
"It’s dumb in the context of comparing them to the Suns. You can always say they could have kept Harden but the fact is they could and they didn’t. If you’re KD or WB that decision was never in your hands, just like team decisions aren’t in Bookers hands. What if mikael bridges turns into Klay Thompson but decides to leave in 2 years for max money? What if DA never reaches the same efficiency in the playoffs? It’s too much extrapolation. You have to look at the roster each season and how they positioned themselves by playoff time and then assess if a championship is realistic. No player can dictate their luck or others actions. The fact of the matter is OKC never made it back, and that’s all the evidence you need to say ok wow Booker might never make it back either."
"That's hyperbole, Klay Thompson was a better third option."
Klay “Man on the Street” Thompson
"I mean, is it? Hood's shooting efficiency dipped by like 5% all around and he relies much more on an off-the-dribble game than Klay. You think Klay Thompson, a consensus top 5 shooter in history is suddenly gonna be a 35% shooter from 3? Klay is most likely gonna get a 13 month timeline, which only Wall and KD has ever really gotten and is gonna be on serious minutes restrictions for the first month or so.  And as unfortunate as it is, [Hood had to taken out of the game before because his Achilles was sore and he wasn't sure if he would be able to play.](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/update-rodney-hood-has-torn-left-achilles-tendon) He tried to play and he tore his Achilles the very next game. That was a more serious red light for a potential injury than even usual Achilles injuries.   Klay at least has a little bit of optimism because he tore his Achilles on his non-dominant (right) leg, the same one as KD and Dominique Wilkins, examples of two of the most successful Achilles injury recoveries in the NBA. Now I'm not implying that Klay is gonna come back 100%, but Rodney Hood's injury was probably more serious than even the majority of Achilles injuries. That's not really a great comparison imo."

Who should the warriors push their chips into the table for that is going to win them a championship if Klay Thompson does not come back healthy?"

"People don’t watch basketball. When they do watch it is a lot of steph curry, damian lillard highlights. They think 3pt is the only way to win and That is not how Lakers, nor Milwaukee won their rings. Ofcourse 3pt shot is important but if you have the best defense in the league paired with extreme half court , transition sets and you are scoring every damn time you come up the court, its going to be real damn hard to stop you. You need someone like Klay Thompson catching fire to stop you and unfortunately neither Klay, nor Steph, nor Damian, or beal or whatever class shooter is available for Kuzma/Kcp."
Yeah I don't understand why the Cavs don't just buy him out of his contract already so he can go take the min and play with his childhood friend Klay Thompson
Really is crazy. Just like when KD and another defensive guard named Klay Thompson weren’t healthy for their last finals appearance and that team wasn’t as good after either!

Nigeria just needs one NBA star-caliber player and they could have a chance to medal one day. If they had a Klay Thompson type it would take them a long way.
Ceiling Klay Thompson.  Floor? Maybe Monk worst case scenario but I feel like his floor is Hield.  Pre high on him though.
"First off, you're forgetting the whole context of why people even wanted to trade Embiid. His health track record. Which even now, is still shaky.  Michael Jordan/Ron Harper is a strawman. The better analogy: would you rather trade Klay Thompson or Draymond Green?  One season ago, would have been blasphemy to trade Klay over Dray. An ACL and a Achilles injury later. Things have completely changed...  Health is a big factor when considering trades."

"This thread has become a tabloid fodder. I’m not doubting the validity of the anonymous source, but what’s the point of revealing this? What is there to gain about leaking a story that basically trashes a high character 20 year old kid who lead this college team to the National championship game…. A player who you didn’t pick? Like seriously what is the point?  It reflects badly on the Raptor front office that they let this get out. I mean, how about next year when they are trying out prospective picks? A high pick might not work out for the Raptors because figure that someone in the know with the Raptors, “might leak my workout and try to tank my stock”  This leak all has to come from the flack they are getting for not drafting Suggs. They weren’t required to draft Suggs regardless of the fanfare. But in that case if they are feeling such heat, come out with a statement from Masai that says, “we had a lot of tough decisions in the draft room, but we decided Barnes was our guy.” Simple as that.  This thread is making Suggs out to be a bust and a diva, of which he is neither. He’s not Klay Thompson as a shooter, but I would also like to see the other picks in this class make the defensive play and cross court bounce pass assist Suggs made in the final four game against UCLA in crunch time. He’s going to be just fine. So is Barnes. Enough with the gossip."
Westbrook and LeBron overlap too much that the ceiling isn't going to raise that much imo. The Lakers needed a Klay Thompson type of player instead and then they would have been the clear favorites. I just don't see this team hitting their stride unless LeBron or Westbook changes up their game a bit.
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler… are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
"Klay Thompson is also a ""modern"" SG.    Having a playmaking, point-of-attack SG is something that can work, esp. if the PG isn't that so much.  But having a 3 and D  style who can handle lots of different matchups is a route to success."

"I'm fully on board with this. It's hard to think about potentially hurting our future by trading promising young guys, but it's once in a blue moon you have a Stephen Curry on your team. Even rarer to have a Klay Thompson *also*, so I think it's insane to not go all in on that real present in exchange for *maybe* a good future."
I think adding klay Thompson might help tho
"Yeah, bigger players never get injured. A 6'6 guy like Klay Thompson wouldn't know anything about injuries. Definitely nothing about missing two full seasons because of them."
"You are questioning Klay Thompson please, the guy is a serious person and has taken his injury with all the care, the Splash brothers you will see them again this coming season"
"If his efficiency doesnt go through the roof playing with Lebron fucking James then I really dont know what to say.  Hes so explosive and athletic that he could literally be the Klay Thompson of driving to the basket, rather than shooting threes"
Consistent shooter with defense is literally just Klay Thompson.
"Let's just do this. I'll go through each team and tell you which players are better than Middleton.  PHI (Embiid)   BRK (Durant, Harden, Irving\*) (\* I consider toss-ups that I lean towards the other player)   MIL (Antetokounmpo)   NYK (none)   ATL (none)   MIA (Butler)   BOS (Tatum, Brown\*)   WAS (Beal)   IND (none)   CHO (none)   CHI (none)   TOR (none)   CLE (none)   ORL (none)   DET (none)  UTA (Mitchell)   PHO (none, but Booker and Paul are right there and you could argue either is better and I wouldn't complain)   DEN (Jokic, Murray is close but not there yet)   LAC (George, Leonard)   DAL (Doncic)   POR (Lillard)   LAL (James, Davis)   MEM (none)   GSW (Curry) (I'd take Khash straight-up over Thompson and wouldn't think twice because of the injuries)   SAS (none)   NOP (none) (Zion will probably overtake Khash at some point)   SAC (none)   MIN (none)   OKC (none) (SGA will probably overtake Khash at some point)   HOU (none)  That's 17 teams and 18 players definitely better. If, as a matter of taste, you're adding people like Booker/Paul/Klay/Zion/Trae/Randle/Westbrook/Gobert ahead of him, cool - so he's like top 30 in that case.   Here's the general case for Middleton.  For the last 4 years, Middleton has given you 20/6/4 in an environment in which he is a) unable to get high-usage because Giannis is taking 33% of the teams' available shots and b) playing very good if not great defense. He's a 50/39/88 guy in that span on 15.4 FGA. Even in the lineups where Giannis is off the court and Middleton is on, the Bucks have been league average or better. Add to that the fact that he's above average to great at all shot distances with the exception of being a poor rim finisher (a role he is NEVER asked to play with Giannis on the team) and I think it's an easy argument to say he's a great player.   Let's compare him to Jimmy Buckets for a minute.   Last 4 seasons:   JB - 20/6/5 on 50/31/85 and 24.6% usage   KM - 20/6/4 on 50/39/88 and 25.2% usage  You might as well use the pam-same-image.jpg here. I'd take Jimmy here - he's a little more careful with the ball and his ability to get to the line makes him less variant. That said, it's close - we should absolutely be considering those two players as very near each other in skill level (and if someone said Jimmy Butler was a top-20, top-25 player nobody would bat an eye)."
"wonder if he'll freak out the same if someone says ""and GSW has another all star in Klay Thompson"".   or AD."
Durant is insane off ball. He can play a game like the best possibile version of klay thompson if needed.
"I can't believe you are arguing that. 23 year.luka next season &gt; 37 year old lebron, and kd &gt; AD, or luka &gt; AD and KD &gt; older lebron, bro don compare the teams 2 years ago wheb KD was injured and luka a rookie.  And then steph and clay, yeah KD and luka arent the best defenders, but KD is still better than thompson and luka is a better defender than steph. This matchup would be alot of shooting, but steph and klay are on 3s where luka and KD can drive hard, when they have an off night from 3. Steph+klay are better shooter ,but overall is klay not near luka and KD. Those guys are probably gonna be top 5 next year.  Where steph is a better shooter than luka, there you have still KD where they are arguibly have the same offensive inpact (KD nad steph), so on offense it comes down to klay and luka. And if you think klay is an better player than luka, even on offense jwsus crust, watch some games. Kaly is the better catch and shoot player, but on every other aspect, luka&gt;klay."
This is giving me Klay Thompson and his dog vibes
"&gt; His impact in his role is too small, even if he’s real efficient at it.  25ppg scorer and elite POA defender.  He'd be one of the highest-scoring #2s in NBA history.  &gt;He could keep getting even better, but it’s unlikely he’ll get to that point. The #2 on the top tier contenders are the likes of AD, Harden.   Lol.  Here are some other #2s over the past decade:  * Kris Middleton * Pascal Siakam * Kyrie Irving * Klay Thompson * Tony Parker * Jason Terry"
Klay (NBA) and Trayce (MLB) Thompson too.
"The Bucks have great spacing. Just because Middleton and Holiday were cold some nights didn't mean the Suns stopped contesting their shots.  Spacing isn't about how many threes you hit, but the general quality and reputation of your shooters. Klay Thompson could go 0-10 and you'd still be hounding him at the perimeter"
"They lost KCP not Klay Thompson.  You can replace KCP's shooting easily. They gained a hell of a lot more than they lost. And what they lost, they can easily replace with players that are going to want to play for a ring and will be willing to take pay cuts for vet minimums and MLE's."
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
Klay Thompson  over so many of those guys
Nah they just need Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson and they'll be good.
"""Klay thompson, steph curry, two of the best to ever do it when you look at   **mody moodsy mody mood m-mody mooses mody mooses mody mmo- MOSES MOODY""**"
"""I compare him (Duarte) to a poor man's Klay Thompson"".   Lol. Being described as ""poor man's"" on draft day sounds rude."
Budget Klay Thompson? Sounds like the ideal role player.
Then then we don’t have any decent wings except Klay Thompson and JTA. Are we really relying on them instead of ironman Wiggins?
"Sure.   But don’t you also have to add in the opponents defense as well? Lakers now have three guys that are almost impossible to defend with one defender.   You gonna game plan to stop LeBron? Wonder how Westbrook will do against your third best defender and no double teams?   A huge reason Klay Thompson has been able to average 20 points a game is because teams design their defense to stop Curry. And with Durant there, Klay was given so many open looks because defenses had to focus on Durant and Curry first and second. Leaving Klay with the opposing teams third best defender and rarely facing a double team.   Having three guys that can score 40 points and that are also above average passers does a lot to minimize spacing issues."
"For some reason Pick 13 and Pick 15 have been amazing picks for various teams over the years.  Pick 13: Mitchell, Booker, Levine, Kobe, Karl Malone.   Pick 15: Giannis, Kawhi, Nash.   &amp;#x200B;  Strangely cannot say the same for the other picks from 11-16, just not on the level of 13 and 15.   Pick 11: Shai GA, Klay Thompson, Reggie Miller.   Pick 12: Steven Adams, Mookie Blaylock.  Pick 14: Michael Porter Jr, Bam Adebayo, Tim Hardaway, Clyde Drexler.   Pick 16: Ron Artest, John Stockton."
"Foir about 20 years, the predominant approaches towards winning were (1) have a dominant center/big man and (2) play defense. Scores used to be 75-68. That began to shift in the mid-2000s with Mike D'Antoni bringing a more European approach to the NBA, emphasizing scoring over defense. Meanwhile, in 2010, Lebron James left Cleveland to team up with two of the best players in the league on the Miami Heat and gave rise to the modern ""super team."" At the end of James' time in Miami, Steph Curry and the Warriors were coached by known idiot Marc Jackson, and were a playoff team but were disregarded as not a title contender because they didn't have the prototypical center. When James returned to Cleveland, the warriors won their first title through defense, player movement, and Steph &amp; Klay Thompson hitting a million three pointers. For the next four years, Cleveland and the Warriors met in the finals, two ""small market teams"" compared to other teams like the Lakers. The Warriors won three out of the four match ups. In the wake of the warriors teams value three point shooters and wing players who can shoot threes and play defense. At this point, analytics have guided the way teams play and arrange their offnese, prioritizing high percentage shots (three pointers from the corner, layups/dunks at the rim). Nonstars shooting midrange shots are considered a big no-no. In its current iteration, NBA players change teams much more frequently, to the chagrin of old crotchety media members.   &amp;#x200B;  Also, the knicks have sucked forever but tell themselves they're going to land the best players in free agency (they never do). They made the playoffs for the first time in a while and got smoked in the first round."
"They should have known it would be difficult post-Durant &amp; after their core got paid. The Warriors' payroll and veterans make it really difficult to re-build on the fly.  The Warriors' payroll is LOCKED UP for the next few years and they're committed to almost $140 million for just to 4 players  *Players* | 2021-22 | 2022-23 :-- | --: | --: Stephen Curry | 45.8 | — Klay Thompson | 37.9 | 40.6 Andrew Wiggins | 31.6 | 33.6 Draymond Green | 24.0 | 25.8  If Curry leaves next FA, the Warriors have *no* chance at contention without a rebuild."
klay thompson
I’ve been told I look like klay Thompson
"Report: 76ers demand Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and the ghost of 2Pac in blockbuster trade, Warriors indicate they are “tentative” to give up this many assets"
7'0 Klay Thompson is his best comp
"Klay Thompson, OSHA  Inspector"
No sir I want klay Thompson and I figured if someone from the warriors saw this it might plant the seed in his head.
Yup that's who he compares himself in the interview. I see a  poor man's klay thompson.
Hawks looking for their Klay Thompson
"Sam Francisco for Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and both GS Picks"
"You just compared 3 polar opposite personalities, Shaq who is one of the least serious/goofiest guys in NBA history. Klay Thompson who just enjoys his life, and Kyrie who acts like a pseudo-intellectual. Of course all three are going to have different responses to that one situation, Shaq used those shoes to provide affordable shoes to kids, donate alot of his shoe proceeds to inner cities, Kyrie is very into him self and his own image obviously, and it may seem ""petty"" but can you judge a man for caring about how he's perceived by others? And Klay is the opposite of that in just enjoying his situation and his own shoe partnership, that is reasonable to assume he has full control over what shoes his name is/isn't on"
Klay Thompson is going to find you and beat you up
Ja in the 30s range and Middleton at 25 because I think all players below him on your list are better than him besides Ja and then Klay Thompson is better imo also
Steve Nash and Klay Thompson is where I drew the line. He expanded to far. But he has a point with Nigeria (+ 4-6 african countries that closely border it and caribean islanders of african decent (since they had nigerians mainly exported there) that works. People from the tribes aroudn that area of west africa are more athletic on average than other places in the world
"Pretty much. Reminds me of Zach Lowe, Harlabob, Bill Simmons sitting around talking about how trading Klay Thompson for Kevin Love is a no brainer.  KOC learned from the best"
Rubio-?-Ingram-Zion-JV. ingram is gonna have to become klay thompson
"Wolves were also ""rumoured"" to trade Love for Klay Thompson of the Warriors at that point."
"You responded to my other comment but deleted your comment? The team who lost to France is not same team you proposed in your description lol. There was no Harden, Lebron, Curry, AD, Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Jimmy Butler.   If it was the current US team against Europe’s best, I think you’d have a case but if it’s the same core who has won 3 gold medals in a row under FIBA rules, I have a hard time seeing them lose."
Klay Thompson becomes a bit Australian
Correction: the highest team is whichever one has Klay Thompson on it.
"[6'6"" on nba.com](https://www.nba.com/player/202691/klay-thompson).  A lot of players lost an inch when the NBA wanted everyone remeasured without shoes a couple years ago."
"My 6’6” Line up can run with anybody PG - Zach LaVine, SG - Klay Thompson, SF - Jaylen Brown, PF - DeMar DeRozen, C - Draymond Green"
Klay Thompson is gonna propel my fantasy team to the moon I know it. He’s gonna come back looking fantastic
Bulls are hard to beat when Lonzo Ball turns into Klay Thompson. Caruso has a shot at an all defensive team too.
I swear he's more likely to mishandle it than he is to miss a shot lol  The Klay Thompson approach of 30 points on like 3 completed dribbles worked well today
When did Lonzo go from ben simmons to klay thompson?
KD going for the Klay Thompson style game today  30 points zero successful dribbles lol
"Computer sees Klay with 3.5, 0, and 0 WAR the last three years, so he’s only expected to produce 0.3 WAR this year in 700 minutes. It’s really dragging down the team numbers for now.    https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/klay-thompson/"
But not a healthy version of Klay Thompson?
"It's good to some extent.  It's also really foolish.  Any player who cares about their legacy or future would take a pay cut to play on a stacked team, but most of them want the immediate payout (reasonable, career ending injuries are possible) and to be the star (reasonable again, more money for being a star than not).  I mean imagine Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Lebron, and Anthony Davis and Giannis or Jokic all on the same team.  Analytics are way more relevant to baseball though, because 9 players performing marginally better per dollar adds up a lot more than in basketball, not to mention baseball is hardly a team spot the way basketball is."
I remember thinking Klay Thompson was a bad draft pick because he would be an inefficient scorer that didn't play defense like so many other past Warriors picks. Up to that point the Warriors didn't draft well and just got lucky Curry landed in their laps.
Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are too 75 players of all time.
"I don’t care about your facts and statistics, I feel klay Thompson is a top 75 all time player because I want it to be so"
Klay Thompson is the only one I think is universally beloved
Klay Thompson
"Dwight Howard takes it that way, but he should rather look at who are the other absentees of this NBA 75 list.  Pau Gasol, Artis Gilmore, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, Alex English, Klay Thompson, Dikembe Mutombo, Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady, ...  In short, Dwight Howard is one of those players who could have been part of an extended list of 90 players, but I do not think his absence is a scandal, to tell the truth.  Personally, in front of him, I already had Pau Gasol, Klay Thompson, Tony Parker, or Manu Ginobili."
Klay Thompson is returning tomorrow.
We all know Klay Thompson would throw if he wasn't always smoking to quell his bloodlust.
"What do I need to address, there is plenty of sample size? I don't know what your definition of large sample size is. For me even 200 minutes is more than good enough with the right filtering. You're comparing it to OKC that played like 6 different seasons. GSW only used Steph/ KD/ Green/ Thompson lineups for only 3775 minutes in 3 seasons, including playoffs, for comparison. That's the maximum sample size you're going to get.   Curry without Green/ Klay/ KD is a 9.36 on 295 minutes. Steph with just Klay is 9.66 on 249 minutes. Steph with KD is 13.48 on 734 minutes.   Now let's compare this with other combinations to see who is doing the heavy lifting (these include playoffs):   Steph/ Green / Klay: 11.08 on 1228 minutes   Green / Klay: 0.89 on 1179 minutes   KD/ Green: 12.68 on 213 minutes (very high for whatever reason, this drops to 9.91 on 97 minutes if Iguodala is excluded as well)   KD/ Klay: -0.77 on 1179 minutes !   Klay: -1.16 on 682 minutes   KD: 6.06 on 649 minutes   Green: -5.33 on 236 minutes  The overall conclusion we can draw is impact metrics hate Klay. KD does fine alone and with Draymond, but not to the extent of Curry. Very similar to OKC numbers of 6-8 net rating. He also doesn't improve the team nearly as much as Curry, not even close. Draymond can improve the team more than KD but is awful as a single option. This should all make logical sense.   &gt; Do you honestly think that a team with Curry and 4 mediocre to average players wins 70+ games if they are all healthy for the full season?  It's not a matter of health, it's the fact that Curry can't play 48 minutes. So you're only playing on a 70 win pace for partial minutes a game.   &gt; If so you are literally calling him the GOAT lmao  I'm just repeating what the stats are showing me. Curry's impact metrics do in fact eclipse the likes of MJ/ LeBron/ KD/ Bird / Robinson etc. They are historically good. And we know it's not the other players inflating his stat"
"Forgot to add, here's a longer version of the first table with the 50 biggest connections. I think Tim Duncan/ Tony Parker are the only pair that show up on both sides of this:  | Shooter | Assister | Number of assists | |:------:|:------:|:------:| | Karl Malone | John Stockton | 1572 | | Tim Duncan | Tony Parker | 1533 | | Kevin Durant | Russell Westbrook | 1466 | | Blake Griffin | Chris Paul | 1157 | | Amar'e Stoudemire | Steve Nash | 1155 | | Marc Gasol | Mike Conley | 1121 | | David West | Chris Paul | 1120 | | Klay Thompson | Stephen Curry | 962 | | Richard Hamilton | Chauncey Billups | 934 | | Richard Jefferson | Jason Kidd | 890 | | Kevin Garnett | Rajon Rondo | 878 | | Carlos Boozer | Deron Williams | 834 | | Shawn Marion | Steve Nash | 823 | | Allen Iverson | Eric Snow | 812 | | Steven Adams | Russell Westbrook | 809 | | Bradley Beal | John Wall | 797 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Steve Nash | 797 | | Antawn Jamison | Gilbert Arenas | 790 | | Ray Allen | Rajon Rondo | 787 | | Zydrunas Ilgauskas | LeBron James | 785 | | Stephen Curry | Draymond Green | 776 | | Serge Ibaka | Russell Westbrook | 774 | | Anthony Davis | Jrue Holiday | 770 | | Clint Capela | James Harden | 760 | | Vince Carter | Jason Kidd | 760 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Kidd | 753 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Terry | 744 | | Mehmet Okur | Deron Williams | 740 | | Marcin Gortat | John Wall | 735 | | Paul Pierce | Rajon Rondo | 727 | | Shaquille O'Neal | Kobe Bryant | 727 | | Tony Parker | Tim Duncan | 713 | | Juwan Howard | Rod Strickland | 711 | | Udonis Haslem | Dwyane Wade | 702 | | Clifford Robinson | Jason Kidd | 694 | | Tim Duncan | Manu Ginóbili | 672 | | Klay Thompson | Draymond Green | 668 | | Paul Pierce | Antoine Walker | 666 | | Jermaine O'Neal | Jamaal Tinsley | 648 | | Josh Smith | Joe Johnson | 636 | | Glenn Robinson | Sam Cassell | 633 | | J.J.

"Do you think Michael Jordan and Klay Thompson have similar physical gifts? No? That’s what comparing Clint capela to Giannis is. Is Clint capela a good athlete for his size? Sure.  Giannis is arguably the best athlete at his size EVER. It’s like him and wilt. No one else has their combination of height, strength, and mobility."
"You're totally missing the point I'm making: ""time on the ball vs assists"" isn't empirical evidence of anything. It's a useless stat that tells you absolutely nothing about how good of a playmaker a player is. It punishes primary ball handlers and rewards secondary playmakers and therefore it's only marginally useful for telling you HOW a player plays, but not how good they are are actually creating  shots for others.  I could take the ""time on the ball vs points"" route and tell you Klay Thompson and Duncan Robinson are the best scorers in the league because they hold the ball FAR less than KD and Giannis. It would be meaningless too, except to tell me that Klay and Duncan don't have to create their own shots"

I think there is an error in the code. I tried running it against Klay Thompson and it returned NULL.
Lol as Klay Thompson sits on his boat crying because he’s not a top 100 player in the NBA
Klay Thompson vlogs
yeah and klay thompson is kinda a big reason the warriors won 3 championships and the grizzlies won 0
When did Melo turn into prime Klay Thompson?
Klay Thompson. I mean seriously have you guys watched him play?   Me neither :’-(
Korkmaz is Turkish Klay Thompson
"Young Glove and Young Bucket are absolutely electric. Curry seems to be coasting a bit. Everyone assumed that by rostering Wiseman, Kuminga, Moody on a team trying to contend we wouldn’t have the depth. Is it just me or did Bob Myers thread the needle. Win now and avoid trading the future. I could see Jordan Poole averaging 22. Moody is playable. Kuminga and Wiseman won’t play much this season or playoffs but if the Current 12 man rotation adds back a serviceable Klay Thompson and everyone stays healthy then we will have a good shot of coming out of the west."
Do the 2021-22 Warriors have the record for most NBA sons?  * Steph - Dell Curry (1986-2002) * Klay - Mychal Thompson (1978-1991) * Andrew - Mitchell Wiggins (1983-1987; 1989-1992) * Gary II - Gary Payton (1990-2007)
"It's okay, things will fall apart once they bring Klay Thompson back  p_p"
Is that Klay Thompson for Kevin Love trade still on the table? Lol
Pick a name lol. It’s fucking Klay Thompson
It’s Klay Thompson. Whoever has to lose minutes will lose minutes
Klay Thompson bout to shoot 60% from 3 when he comes back...
Klay Thompson would not have gotten injured.
[Klay Thompson is unintentionally hilarious and wholesome as hell](https://youtu.be/t40e3kaHmrs)
"I'm not making an excuse for why they're bad at creating for others, I'm explaining why Marcus Smart isn't correct in calling them out.  Them being selfish isn't why their offense is bad this year.  It's bad because they don't have a real point guard on the team.  Much like Kerr wouldn't ask Klay Thompson to create all the offense for others, why do fans/redditors expect Jaylen Brown to be doing that.  It's perfectly okay for a shooting guard to average 3-4 assists and pass the ball within the offense.  But if the option is to swing the ball to Marcus Smart or take a somewhat uncontested 3 himself, there's no reason to over pass.  I know there's the philosophy of turning a good shot into a great shot, but a good shot from Brown is worth more than a great shot from pretty much anyone else on the current roster.  Same reason why your fan base would rather have Steph or Klay take somewhat open shots over Draymond taking wide open shots."
"Klay Thompson was the third best player for 2 years of the dynasty, he’s had some great games but there is a reason he didn’t make the 75 greatest players and probably won’t make the next round in 25 year but go ahead and go off"
"Jordan Poole. Could end up being most improved or 6th man depending on when Klay Thompson comes back...obviously I’m being a homer here, but the step hes taken is crazy based on how “bad” he’s been in the past seasons."
"So, is Klay Thompson or Jamal Murray on the ballot as well? How is this dude being there more controversial than Klay or Jamal?"
Klay Thompson
ESPN: Iguodala unhappy with Jordan Poole's performance of late. Says he needs to stop playing like Klay Thompson.
"Sure.  But Mark Jackson had Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and numerous excellent passers, and instead of setting picks and letting them shoot, he slowed things down and posted up Harrison Barnes, over and over.  Years after every other coach in the game figured out that the post up was outmoded and inefficient, he kept doing it.  Like it was still 1993.  And he did it with a guy who is terrible at posting up.  but I'm willing to accept that Boylen and Jackson BOTH suck ass as coaches"
Klay Thompson desperate for attention
I'd take Klay Thompson over Russel Westbrick statpadding ass.
"I know it’s extremely early but is this the deepest warrior team we’ve seen? We not be as top heavy with slightly older curry, draymond, Klay and Iguodala. But looking back at the 73 win team we had; Ian Clark, speights, mcadoo, Jason Thompson, and varajao. GP2 our 15th man really messing with my mind."
Klay Thompson replacement
"Dude straight-up shoulder checks Klay Thompson and then gets mad when he gets called for the foul.  It's one thing to complain about bullshit calls, but when you whine every time you don't get a foul call you think you should've, it just makes you come across as...well, whiny.  The NBA is on pace to shoot a record low number of free throws, and I'm all for it."
“It’s bad luck to kill a sea bird”  - Klay Thompson
Aaron Rodgers absolutely heated seeing klay Thompson wear a mask while exercising
"Hard disagree. All of those players are amazing without Curry. Klay Thompson can take over a game on his own and can run around and get open without Curry. Iguodala was all defensive and an all star before coming to the warriors. Bogut had been an all defensive player before Curry. Harrison Barnes was still developing on the warriors but its pretty clear watching him in Sacramento that he has plenty of talent. We saw last season how far Curry can take a team without the great supporting cast. Also, a lot of credit has to go to Kerr for maximizing the talent that the warriors had. I think Curry is a much better player than Westbrook, but that individual Westbrook season was unprecedented and Westbrook played far beyond the player he normally is."
"We all know who it is. It’s Klay Thompson. I understand that he’s currently #2, but he’s the exact profile of a player you would want.    1) doesn’t need the ball  2) constant off ball movement   3) dead eye shooter for spacing.   4) Isn’t a rhythm player. Very consistent with hot streaks.   5) big game clutch player.    Name me one team he couldn’t fit in…"
In a couple months everyone will be saying Klay Thompson when Jordan Poole averages 30 ppg the rest of rhe season
If it were so easy to find real 3 and d guys everyone would have their own prime Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson vibes
Klay Thompson 💯💯💯💯💯 needs to in that lineup
"Yeah like the guy that injured the most players in his career, the guy that injured Klay Thompson more than the rest of the league combined, the guy that killed most people out of all NBA players, all time leader in undercutting players mid-air and so on and so forth."
"Easy answer: leave  Hard answer: find a way to coach the team himself and draw up an offense that utilizes properly a big man who’s both the most efficient post scorer and shoots 3s with the volume and efficiency of 2019 klay Thompson.  Sorry lmao, I know someone has to get whipped on Reddit as a loser, but we’ve all seen that most big men can’t carry a team alone. AD made the playoffs twice in a pelicans uniform."
"At worst it’s like adding Raptors Danny Green to the roster. At best it’s, like adding… well Klay Thompson. With his playstyle, he’s not going to disrupt the offense if he’s a little disappointing"
Klay thompson is an amazing human. He developed skills in basketball to move as little as possible (see game where he scores 60 points and only taking like 30 steps lol). He dates insta models. Owns a boat. And plays on super teams so the pressure is never on him. He got life figured out.
Regarding the 73 win Warriors it's worth pointing out that Klay Thompson averaged 27 PPG on 64% TS in the first two rounds of the 2016 playoffs to get them to the WCF with Curry playing a total of 111 minutes in two series  I've always felt that those teams' bad net ratings without Curry were just because they had to get used to playing a different system that wasn't built around him  If you gave them a full offseason to train I actually think Klay could do quite well as the first option
Bane is a sophomore. He could be an all star in a few years on the right team- ala klay Thompson. But yes unlikely
"Kelly Oubre Jr is murdered, cut to Klay Thompson dipping on the sidelines?"
That's called Klay Thompson.
Klay Thompson?
Oubre felt some kind of way with the idea of coming off the bench for future HOF Klay Thompson and now is coming of the bench for Terry Rozier ...lol🤣🤣
"Yeah because moving Klay to the 3 and playing Green at the C would be so crazy and insane, right? Klay's only 6'7"" and was one of the best defenders in the league. Here's some quotes from reddit about Klay. How many do you agree with?  &gt;who gonna play defense with Curry and Lillard on the floor? The ghost of Klay Thompson?   ...   &gt;I think he will drop off significantly. People keep talking about him not needing to dribble to be effective, but he runs around a lot to actually get open for his shots... Also, his defense is likely going to fall off a cliff.  ...  &gt;People saying his game will age well is when he didn't have two major injuries. His offensive game is completely reliant on his off ball movement. Which has a very good chance of not aging well with his injury history.  ...  &gt;I think it's more likely than not that Klay won't be close to what he was before his injuries.  ...  &gt;LOL. You think he can just sit 40 feet out and be reliable? Yeah, you don't understand how basketball works. Sorry dude, I can't talk with someone this ignorant. I'll see you in six months."
"I agree with the points about the pressure, but Blazers also need to shake things up because they don't have a Klay Thompson coming back. If GSW didn't have Klay coming back as a potential resource, I'm sure there would have been a lot more speculation about shaking things up over the offseason as well, and the trades involving the rooks and Wiseman and whatnot would've been a lot more realistic."
"The Toast with Klay ""Toaster"" Thompson"
"ehh there's a difference.  A lot of guys have acute injuries that are serious and miss big periods of time.  AD you never know if he's going to play because he routinely misses 15-20 games a season.  Guys like Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and even John Wall were playing just about every game when they didn't have serious injuries they were rehabbing.  That's the difference and that's why AD gets clowned."
"It's Kobe and Shaq.  MJ and Pippen were more successful, but the gap between the two was so huge that it's tough to call them a true duo.  2nd is Curry and KD, but Kobe and Shaq had pretty limited talent surrounding them where the Warriors and Draymond and Klay Thompson."
"Draymond is under contract for two years and then has a player option worth about $27.6 million, which is probably more than what Draymond would be getting by then. Draymond will be 34 years old by the end of his current contract + player option.  The Warriors do however have a lot of FA decisions at the end of 2023-24 which includes the end of Draymond’s player option year, as well as the end of Klay Thompson and James Wiseman’s contracts. But Klay and Draymond will both turn 34 by then, which probably enables the Warriors to pay both him and Klay an amount they’ll be okay with. (And could also enable Poole and Wiseman’s new extensions)  The fact that Andrew Wiggins and Klay’s new contracts (if it happens) will most likely be less than their current ones also enables the Warriors to further pay Draymond a sufficient amount. Even if the Warriors decide to extend Jordan Poole and Wiseman, add in the fact that the new TV deal is probably going to extend the salary cap and Lacob is capable of paying a ridiculous amount of luxury tax. Draymond will probably get the money he desires unless he wants $30+ million a year."
From what I understand positive Thunder posts get awards and pro Klay Thompson posts get awards. Just how it works.
"Cristiano Ronaldo signed a 2 years contract to come back to England, Messi signed a 4 years deal with Barcelona and now he signed 2 years to play for PSG. Neymar signed a 4 years deal as well, etc.. It's extremely rare for soccer leagues to sign more than 4 years, that's the point. Even for ""star"" players like the ones I mentioned, 2 years, 4 years tops, etc.. that's a good range of flexibility for both sides. I am not saying players should be denied salary if they get hurt by exercising their ""job"", my point is about teams having enough flexibility to pay what was dealt in the contract and that's it, get rid of the dead weight without too much of a problem. Let's say Messi just blows his knees after playing a few games for the PSG, then he rehabs... next season his knees gets screwed up again, PSG can simply terminate the contract, give him the money and go search for someone else. NBA teams can't do that because there is too much money on the table, also too many years for their contracts, so the average NBA players have much more security and leverage than any other professional athlete in the planet.   Now swap the Messi example with Klay Thompson: 2 seasons wasted with injuries, now he is attempting a comeback after injuring the achilles... there's a very realistic chance he will lose this third season as well with another injury. So what gives, what are the options for Golden State? They just signed him the same infamous extension of 5 years, 190 million... who will want to absorb this nonsensical contract if Klay indeed becomes a dead weight? No one, simple as it is, the Warriors doesn't have any leverage, they have to keep him no matter what. Now if Klay signed 4 years, 3 years or so, etc.. that would give enough flexibility for the Warrior to get rid of him and move on. This 5 years range of the NBA is nonsensical and ludicrous, just too much leverage for the players, multiple teams stuck with players that literally can't contribute and for the ones who are actually healthy, let's say Tatum for example, why he should strive to get better if his overpaid 5 years contract is guaranteed? These players get accommodated, they stop caring, that affects the competitive level of the league. Why the regular season is so pathetic in the NBA compared to every other mainstream sport? Because the players are secured, even role players are overpaid nowadays. In the NFL everybody is on the edge, they don't have those multiple years of security, that's why they compete more. In recent years the NFL is trying this approach of giving huge extensions, like the insane Ezekiel Elliott contract (arguably the worst contract I've ever seem in any sport), but most of their contracts are 2 to 4 years tops, if the players don't perform well in this time period, the team can cut them and move on"
"The amount of defense would be non existent. Plus, tasking a two-year rusty Klay Thompson with guarding the likes of Lavine, Leonard, etc would be plain stupid."
"Sure we'll take one steph curry, and one klay thompson."
Im convinced Klay Thompson is just on this planet to have a good time and take some intel back to planet Klay.
"That’s very nice of him to show genuine respect and admiration for his elders but cmon, he’s obviously better overall than Larry Bird. Larry has the MVPs but let’s be real, 2016 Klay Thompson would have been MVP at least once in the late 70s, early 80s"
Klay Thompson just got richer too.
"Yeah you can even notice how much he avoids using his handle compared to guys like Harden and Kyrie  Those guys dribble nonstop as soon as they get the ball  KD holds the ball over his head, does a couple of jab steps and pump fakes, and then either passes it out or shoots over the defender  He almost reminds me of a 7 foot Klay Thompson at times lol  He ""creates his own shot"" in an unconventional way because he's a 7 footer with an all time great jumper rather than with handles like most players do"
"Guys, I'm pretty sure u/alley-oub is Klay Thompson and he's trying to hide it"
"Downvote given.  With zero input from rookies, 2nd year center, and KLAY THOMPSON they are winning.  They will get better."
"&gt;who gonna play defense with Curry and Lillard on the floor? The ghost of Klay Thompson?   ...   &gt;I think he will drop off significantly. People keep talking about him not needing to dribble to be effective, but he runs around a lot to actually get open for his shots. If he can't get as much separation, his effectiveness will go down a ton. Also, his defense is likely going to fall off a cliff."

According to Laker fans he was suppose to be the next Klay Thompson
"Why couldn’t the Clippers role players shoot like this last playoffs. Jackson was looking like Klay Thompson last year, now he looks like Russ shooting"
"What the fuck are you talking about? People keep repeating the lie that Harden never got to 40 with free throws.   Recent games where Harden got to 40 points without needing free throws to reach or surpass that number:  2019-12-28  2019-12-13	  2019-12-11	  2019-11-30  2019-11-16  2019-10-30	  2019-03-22  2019-03-20	  2019-02-28	  2019-01-14  2018-11-26		  2018-01-30	  2017-11-05	  Additionally, the only other player than Harden to reach 50 points without needing free throws is Klay Thompson. Harden still scored a lot without needing free throws. He gets a lot of free throws because he shoots the ball a lot."
"I just don’t know how he stacks up against any of his clones in the 2120s  or Steph S. Thompson the genetic chimera of him, klay, and just a pinch of detlef schrempf."
"There was a time when the Warriors had a player foul out and couldn't replace him because they didn't have any healthy player. Back before the Steph era, trying to remember exactly when.  I will say that in 2020, the Warriors had Steph Curry and Klay Thompson on the shelf for most of the season, which is  got to be the highest percentage of the salary cap a team has ever had injured for that many games."
People are letting their hate boner for Kyrie get in the way lmao  Everyone is still saying that Klay Thompson is a top 2 shooter in the league CURRENTLY and he hasn’t played in a million days
Westbrook as the opposite of Klay Thompson actually makes a lot of sense lmao
Evil Klay Thompson lol.

"You mean the KD with Steph Curry/Klay Thompson combo have been giving Lebron a little bit of trouble, and maybe outplaying him.   Thats no where near a good comparison to Bird, who has more (legit) rings, MVPs, final MVPs, and all NBAs? You serious?"
Not sure if Austin Rivers or Klay Thompson
"The question is who is stopping KD &amp; Kyrie &amp; Harden when Joe ""Klay Thompson"" Harris is wide open in the corner?   Nets might have to win every game 140-130, but a win is a win."
Most people who aren't basketball fans don't even know who Klay Thompson is right now...no casual or non-nba fan will know.who he is in 15 years even.
"Are you really trying to act like Richard Jefferson and Tristan Thompson were on par with Draymond? Klay is also a much better two way player than Love, and GS had better depth. C’mon man."
We went from Klay Thompson to Kent Bazemore so I think we have them beat
"As if guys like Curry have to haggle for shit lol, Klay Thompson seems like a dude that would nickel and dime a car salesman all day because he likes it"
Who is having a better playoffs? Herro or Bertans? Honestly.   Miami misses Crowder big time. He brought the defensive energy and turned into Klay Thompson in the bubble.
Is Klay Thompson floating around. He gives out gold all the time but usually it's to Klay Thompson compliments
Klay Thompson is the greatest basketball player ever
It's me klay Thompson
"Only if KD blows his achilles and Danny Green checks Klay Thompson while in the air so he tears his ACL.  Other than that, no."
Are you suggesting that [Stephen Curry's](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/3975/stephen-curry) and [Klay Thompson's](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/6475/klay-thompson) aren't also comparable?
"Even though you’re kinda lame and obviously dont want much bball, you’re kinda funny. And I respect the effort it took to write your reddit thesis. But just as the overrated Klay Thompson does, sometimes you simply miss the mark 😉"
"So, Steve Nash shot 42% from 3 at 3.2 attempts a game. Klay Thompson has shot 42% from 3 in 7.7 attempts.  Steve Nash shot 46.7% from 10-16 and 48.5% from 16-3 Pt Line  Klay shot 43% from 10-16 and 44.7% from 16- 3 Pt line.  Here's the thing though, Klay equals Nash's efficiency on 3 Pt line at double the volume and is 3 points behind in mid range at a higher volume. 9 vs 7.4 attempts per game.    So I don't know how you can say Nash is better than Klay when Klay is doing similar thing at higher volume. Assisted vs non assisted doesn't matter because we aren't talking about the greatest shot creator but the greatest shooter. At best, it's a what if of where would Steve Nash stand amongst all time great shooters if he did at a much higher volume."
"Thanks for the thoughtful response.      &gt;First of all, like others have said before, you are inconsistent with the metrics that you use. You look at best season for 3's, count the number of good seasons for FT%, and look at career avg for mid range.  I included best season for mid range shooting as well. The stats aren't that inconsistent if you're simply comparing their peak seasons. For me, it's similar to a Magic vs Stockton or to a lesser extent, Jordan vs Lebron situation. Stockton was an elite passer for a much longer time than Magic was in the NBA, but few would argue that Magic was a worse playmaker, because when he peaked, he peaked really high. Many still consider Jordan the GOAT, because they think he peaked higher, but if you're comparing career value, it isn't close anymore, Lebron has 15 MVP-level seasons, Jordan has 10-11.   Similarly, when you're comparing the peak 3 point shooting seasons of elite shooters, Klay's doesn't stand out, especially when you consider the various factors involved. He doesn't have the best efficiency, nor the greatest volume, nor the best combination of both. I readily accept that he's done it more times than any non-Curry player, but that would and should only support the assertion that he's the 2nd best 3 point shooter of all-time, assuming you think longevity is more important.      &gt;Second, you say that Klay doesn't get hotter than anyone in NBA history because for each one of his great performances, there is a comparable performance from someone else.... but no one else (other than Steph) has the amount of crazy shooting nights as Klay.  I could have phrased that better but what I meant was single-game records shouldn't be used to determine things like these. I personally believe he gets hotter than anyone in NBA history, I just don't think it matters in discussions like these.      &gt;Finally, if you're going to say that someone isn't the second best shooter ever, you should probably say who you think is, and list all of the players that you think are better shooters than Klay.  I think Nash is clearly better if you consider mid-range shots, free throws, role, shot difficulty, efficiency, and longevity. His most accurate season was also the season he attempted the most 3s; I think he's one of the players most likely to maintain or even improve his elite efficiency while increasing his attempts, especially if he plays in the modern era or off-ball. (Which would be a complete waste considering he's an on-ball savant). If we're not talking about careers, I think Dame has already peaked higher as well and will stay on this level.      &gt;I understand that Dame shoots more unassisted three's, but Dame has shot 40% from three once in his career, Klay has done it every year of his career. And it's not like Dame shoots a much higher volume. Dame makes 3.0 per game for his career, Klay makes 2.9. I understand that Dame takes many more unassisted attempts, but the disparity in accuracy on similar volume between the two is just too great.  You're comparing career averages, which I don't think is representative of Dame's ability to shoot at this point in his career. If you're comparing their respective best seasons, I think Dame's is clearly more impressive. 10 times more unassisted 3s, even deeper range, slightly worse efficiency.     &gt;As for the other guys you named, they all play a very similar catch-and-shoot role to Klay. Korver shoots 1% better for his career from three but Klay makes nearly 50% more threes per game (2.9 vs 2.0). This same argument can be used for Joe Harris. JJ and Ray make far fewer threes per game and shoot a lower percentage than Klay. And Duncan Robinson just hasn't been in the league long enough for me to consider him.  A lot of this is just career vs peak, which I have addressed.     &gt;As for including mid-range and FT%, this is where things get tricky. I'll give you that when including these things you can easily make an argument that KD or Nash are the second best shooter ever. But all being said, Klay Thompson is absolutely the 2nd greatest 3-point shooter of all time.  I wouldn't have written this post if that's all I heard."
"Yeah this is my favorite part about klay. He may not be the most accurate or create off the dribble, but the moment klay gets hot, the game is over. Done.   ESPN actually wrote a piece on this after his legendary quarter, talking about how the ""hot hand"" is a statistical anomaly. But when looking at klays consecutive makes, it just jumps out of the page. Dudes made 7 shots in a row, 14 TIMES in his career. He's, in different games, made 10, 11, 12, 13 shots in a row, and you know that a significant portion of that are threes.   If you're interested: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/presents-19573519/heating-fire-klay-thompson-truth-hot-hand-nba"
"Yes if you are doing Thompson for Harris or Robinson. Because Thompson is more than a 3pt shooter, he is (or was) also a brilliant defender and like it or not, there is the ""aura"" that you should never let fucking Klay Thompson alone for a 3 pointer. Like never even if he shoots 0-1450 I would still bet my money he makes an open corner 3pt shot. I would say that teams would much easier leave Harris/Robinson open in that case.  But if you just trade *3pt stats* then the argument becomes more complicated as the differences are actually quite small. Granted, Klay hasn't played for 2 years and in those 2 years many things happened favouring 3 point shooters (no fans, 5-out offences, the ""micro-ball"" etc) which could really increase Klay's shooting splits, but since we don't live in that reality, the argument is closer when looking at just the 3pt stats."
"If Joe Harris took a couple extra 3PA per game and made 40% of those extra shots, he'd be a better shooter.  That's Klay Thompson."
"Klay Thompson is the best 3 and D ever.  On my opinion, but arguable, 2nd best shooter in the league tied with Joe Harris.  Klay is the only player besides Steph and Dame, that I would believe can break Kobe's record"
Sigh he’s been out for two years and the nephews are forgetting who Klay Thompson is. Thanks Danny Green!
"I don't understand why this post is getting so much love.  First of all, like others have said before, you are inconsistent with the metrics that you use. You look at best season for 3's, count the number of good seasons for FT%, and look at career avg for mid range. The only reason that someone would really do this is to cherry-pick stats to fit their argument.  Second, you say that Klay doesn't get hotter than anyone in NBA history because for each one of his great performances, there is a comparable performance from someone else. The thing that you forgot to say is that Klay's name is the only one that keeps showing up when you list the crazy shooting games. No one other than Curry comes close to having as many insane shooting performances as Klay. Like you said, he scored 37 in a quarter on 13/13 shooting, 60 in 29 mins, most threes in a playoff game (11), and you forgot he also holds the record for threes in a regular season game (14). All of T-Mac, Reggie, Kobe, Gilbert, and more have performances that can compare to one or two of these, but no one else (other than Steph) has the amount of crazy shooting nights as Klay.  Finally, if you're going to say that someone isn't the second best shooter ever, you should probably say who you think is, and list all of the players that you think are better shooters than Klay.  In each of your 8 main points, you say who would be better than Klay if that argument is the only thing you consider, while throwing around a bunch of different names. It seems like the main people you're considering are Dame, Korver, Ray Allen, JJ Redick, Duncan Robinson, and Joe Harris.  I understand that Dame shoots more unassisted three's, but Dame has shot 40% from three once in his career, Klay has done it every year of his career. And it's not like Dame shoots a much higher volume. Dame makes 3.0 per game for his career, Klay makes 2.9. I understand that Dame takes many more unassisted attempts, but the disparity in accuracy on similar volume between the two is just too great.  As for the other guys you named, they all play a very similar catch-and-shoot role to Klay. Korver shoots 1% better for his career from three but Klay makes nearly 50% more threes per game (2.9 vs 2.0). This same argument can be used for Joe Harris. JJ and Ray make far fewer threes per game and shoot a lower percentage than Klay. And Duncan Robinson just hasn't been in the league long enough for me to consider him.  As for including mid-range and FT%, this is where things get tricky. I'll give you that when including these things you can easily make an argument that KD or Nash are the second best shooter ever. But all being said, Klay Thompson is absolutely the 2nd greatest 3-point shooter of all time."
"I got in a similarly heated debate about Klay Thompson vs. Khris Middleton. I argued Middleton’s shooting seasons this year and last were better than Klay’s best, because, even if Middleton’s percentages were only slightly better, he takes way, way more unassisted shots. On top of that, Middleton is a marginally better rebounder and significantly better creator.   Your next post can be on Klay’s dramatically overrated defense. There’s a reason advanced metrics rate him poorly; he’s great on ball but pretty useless as a team defender, and the eye test backs that if you look for his mistakes. People act like he’s this defensive guru, completing the perfect 3 and D player, but there’s a reason he isn’t a consistent All-Defense selection and was never even mentioned as a DPOY candidate."
"If you think Klay Thompson is only better than Kyle Korver because of the systems they played in, you have a lot of soul searching to do."
Klay Thompson is the most accurate 3pt volume shooter in the postseason.
"I mean, I personally can’t find many ways to hate Klay even if you hated the Warriors during their dynasty run. I remember most of the sub agreeing to Bob Myers (Warriors GM) when he said Derrick Rose and Klay Thompson are ‘universally beloved’.  Correct me if I’m wrong tho."
https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=klay+thompson%25%27s+without+steph+cury+since+2015 here is since 2015 then.  The %'s aren't that much better.
"90 games, [you can check his career stats without curry here](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/klay-thompson-stats-without-steph-curry)"
"Probably has to do with the fact that Klay is one of the most unhateable players in the league while many believed that he was the 2nd best shooter in the league for a while now (since idk, 2015?). With all the crazy records and clutch performances he has it’s kinda hard to refute against that consensus.   I still believe that Klay Thompson one of the 3 greatest shooters in NBA history, but credit to OP, great work here. Lots of good points too."
"We're talking specifically about a THREE. Not who makes the best decision, not whose hands you want the ball in, not who is better at creating a shot period (for themselves or others). We're talking about a 3. That's like saying you'd rather have jordan shoot a clutch postseason 3 than klay thompson or reggie. Ur just wrong"
Heh  Klay Thompson
Joe Harris is basically Klay Thompson lite
"Iggy winning fvmp as a role player on a team with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond is most definitely crazier than the thought that Simmons would get FMVP."
Thompson as in Klay? There's no way they move him. He's as much GSW as Curry. And after the last season and a half of him being hurt they'd look terrible to move him before hes played again
"&gt;And this quote from Chuck is more appropriate towards Eastern Europeans, cause a lot of those places are legit worse than American hoods, so they come with the same type of struggles.  Ok, but why does that help?  Steph Curry and Klay Thompson came from super-privileged basketball families, for instance."
"Klay thompson maybe?  This is an interesting question though. I think the positionless team you listed is better, but thats also a product of how the league has changed"
"If Kerr remains the coach, he can rebuild and that is the continuity in the franchise (in addition to Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, if the latter ever plays basketball again)."
"I clicked the link.  It's not a great take even with context.  &gt; Curry was already the first player to sign a super-max extension in 2017, inking a deal worth over $201 million over five years. He is now eligible to sign a four-year, $215.4 million extension that would keep him under contract through the 2025-26 season.  &gt; On the surface, this looks like a no-brainer.  &gt; After all, Curry is coming off a great regular season, winning the NBA scoring title at age 33, the oldest to do so since Michael Jordan won it at 35 in 1998.  &gt; And that’s nice.  &gt; However, Curry couldn’t even get the Warriors to the postseason in a league where 16 of the 30 teams make it.  &gt; We get it. Sharpshooter guard Klay Thompson missed a second straight season with a major injury.  &gt; Still, Golden State should have made the playoffs.  &gt; The harsh reality is that the Warriors’ championship run is over, cancelled. Not by the culture, but by Father Time.  &gt; With or without Curry in the fold, the Warriors aren’t winning any more titles. It’s a pipe dream at best.  and he cites the Kobe example with the Lakers as to why it'd be a bad deal.  The Warriors prolly aren't winning anymore titles with Steph as the main guy. But most teams aren't - that doesn't mean you move on from a superstar in the name of recouping assets."
"Why do people think the NBA is like NBA 2k myleague where the sole goal is to win a title lol. Steph Curry is probably the most fun player to watch in the NBA, I’m pretty sure he’s got one of the biggest influences on the viewership numbers. Him and Klay Thompson can go out there next season and make a splash in the league, a second or third round exit isn’t all that bad.   People forget tanking doesn’t mean be bad for a couple seasons then get a superstar lol. Maybe it’ll lead to being bad for a few years, bad draft luck, do bad for a few more years, have one or two good players, injury issues, players getting upset etc. Then 8 years pass and you haven’t made the playoffs.  Curry will resign with the Warriors and anyone with half a brain will say it’s a good but obvious signing."
This dude has been shooting like Klay Thompson these two games.
"This is a mostly subjective arguement. KD will go down as one of the most skilled scorers in the game of basketball, Top - 20 all time guaranteed.   Now, a three peat is a different dimension all together so let's just say he wins two or three titles in BKN w/ FMVP atleast twice. This should, on paper, make him move up in the rankings considerably to atleast top 10.  This should theoretically put him in the pantheon of the players who were legendary at their position like Bird or Duncan.  However historical context is definitely important in terms of the legacy arguement. Pure stats alone shouldn't determine the all-time rankings. One should take into account that for most , if not all, of these title runs , Durant had the best supporting cast ever consisting of transcendent players who themselves are atleast top 30, like Steph Curry /James Harden (?) and players who were elite in the roles they played like Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/ Kyrie Irving. Not to mention that the there were almost no teams in the NBA even remotely close to being as good as the GSW dynasty (We'll see how BKN does). So it must take a bit away from KD's personal role on these rings. Don't get me wrong, he was still the best player on these legendary teams, but we should look at the bigger picture here."
"The narrative has switched so much over the past two games. Everyone thought the Mavericks were the ones who couldn’t guard (spoiler: no one can in this series).  Clippers also the best three point percentage team in history, yet the Mavericks are the ones winning the line.  THJ looking like Klay Thompson lite on offense and Luka looking like Lebron with a better jumper.  If Clippers win Game 3, some pressure moves to Mavericks but I can’t see them winning two in Dallas.   GGs Clips"
"Not even at best, if Klay Thompson is your best offensive player you aren't making the post season"
Seems strange to me that nobody is talking about THJ turning into prime Klay Thompson and splashing literally every shot he’s taking.
so just who seemed like they had the most potential as a raw recruit?  (i was wondering why not klay thompson....)
A ton of teams would want him as he fits on pretty much every team seamlessly (a lot like klay thompson would) but the clippers won't get equal value back so they probably wouldn't do it
Klay Thompson commercial makes me wanna put food on the table for the family I don’t even have
"If you add Steph curry , klay Thompson and ray allen jumpers , you will get tim hardaway jr every time he is playing us i swear"
Maxi “Klay Thompson” Kleber
Offensive klay Thompson. Young players who’s progressed every year. Perennial all-nba 3rd if he picks up his defensive game.
His upside is 6’11 Klay Thompson. Realistically he’s like a way upgraded Chris Boucher
11 by Klay Thompson
11 by Klay Thompson
JOE “BRYN FORBES “STEPH CURRY” “KLAY THOMPSON” HARRIS
No that's Klay Thompson
The Warriors may not be in the playoffs but Joe Harris will make you do a double take to make sure it’s not Klay Thompson on the Nets.
Harris really is the Nets Klay Thompson lmao
"joe ""klay thompson"" harris"
Kevon Looney too. He's an excellent defender and offensive rebounder. And obviously Klay Thompson lol. The rest can go.
I guess by himself isn't the right term. But there's a difference between rookie Kyrie and Steph Curry and Klay Thompson
"People were crowning him the next Klay Thompson/Devin Booker after the bubble.   Speaking of Rockets fans, a good portion liked the idea of Herro on a rookie deal which we would be able to extend over Ben Simmons, who was already making 30+M in a Harden trade. I was pretty close into buying into the hype (Jaylen Brown was the player I wanted the most).   Herro can still be a great player but it seems like he’s been pretty up and down this year. The next 2-3 years are going to be telling for his career. Will he be a top5-10 SG or just a nice player than is maybe the 3rd best guy on a competitive team."
"11, Klay Thompson"
Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. Plus Steph is the best off-ball player of all time.
Klay Thompson Milwaukees
when the fuck did forbes summon the ghost of Klay Thompson
Not even close. Ingles is so much better than Clarkson it's like comparing Klay Thompson and Lou Williams
"so, just a note: the title/first tweet and the second tweet do not say the same thing.   *ability* is the operative word, and widens the scope of discussion. draymond’s *ability* to be a scoring threat is vastly improved when klay thompson is on the floor, or when zaza was.   second note, y’all kidding yourself if you don’t think draymond’s playstyle this year was an accident or borne of hesitation to score."
Dude turned into Klay Thompson for a bit.
I thought Klay Thompson came back from injury and got traded to the Bucks
Seriously he looks like Klay Thompson right now and its game 6.
Forbes in the Klay Thompson zone right now
Bryn “Klay Thompson” Forbes
I thought Klay Thompson was injured
Stephen curry and klay thompson existed
"Milwaukee ""Klay Thompson"" Bucks."
Am I watching Brent Forbes or klay Thompson
Id say go be a goalie but lets be honest- he would dive for a ball and wind up out for half the season. Smh. Lebron needs himself a klay thompson or even curry... He needs someone who can bang out points until its clutch time.
&gt; Picks are vastly overrated.   Klay Thompson 11th pick 1st Round Draymond Green 35th pick 2nd Round Steph Curry 7th pick 1st round   Tell me again the best they can hope for.
"Nah, I’m boiling this down to if you’re in your 20’s and worth millions of dollars and the hardest thing you’ve ever done is training everyday to get better at the game you already love playing. Then you don’t get to be a selfish child when shit goes wrong for you.  I mean obviously, you do, just look at the many examples of incredibly privileged rich people and their lack of perspective as to what actual hardship is.  Feel sad if you want to, have self pity if you want to, it won’t help anything, it literally never does. But, also if you’re young, attractive, and incredibly wealthy &amp; successful, maybe shut the fuck up and realize their is actual suffering &amp; actual hardship taking place literally all around you.  Have some perspective &amp; empathy for you fellow human being maybe lmao   Basically any and all sympathy &amp; empathy I have for the people really suffering in our world. Kawhi getting diagnosed with knee tendinitis is about the least sympathetic or sorry for someone I’ve ever felt over their “hardship”.  And for anyone still reading this angry rant, let’s use Klay Thompson as a contrast. I love that dude &amp; his attitude, he’s dealt with WAYYY worse and more serious injuries in his career than Kawhi has, and you’ve never heard a single word from him tryin to blame the medical staff, scapegoating other people, or acting like a fucking Madonna. Nah, it’s just head down, work your ass off and get back, no bitching cause he knows even with his awful luck, how good he’s truly had it in life. Klay is a real one. Kawhi is tissue paper soft.   In summation, we need more Klay Thompson’s in the world, and maybe less Kawhi Leonards lol  This was fun 🙂"
You sound real dumb objecting to klay Thompson being at minimum Kyle Korver. Tf do you think korver was doing other than exactly what you described 😂😂😂
"I'm not concerned. I really like what we see.   I honestly think we should look into what value James Wiseman has on the trademarket. Despite a few flashes of greatness, I just don't think he's going to pan out to be that good, nor do I think he will be an impact player during Steph Curry's window. We could bring in a few veteran players on a trade and sign a free agent center or two. They don't have to be star athletes, they just need to be fundamentally solid like Bogut and Za. No need to find a freak athlete, just somebody who can set a pick and roll, and rebound. That's all we need.  I'm hoping Klay comes back strong, and I'm not stacking the odds against him because we all know how bad he wants it. Case point, look at Durant. If he can come back at that level, we will be just fine.  As for the roster, it's shaping up well. I like a starting lineup of Draymond Green, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins. Throw in a veteran center, or Kevon Looney and you have something cooking. JTA should take off some of the pressure from Klay Thompson. He will make a great sixth man. Jordan Poole is really coming along and will make an excellent backup point guard to Curry. I'm looking forward to seeing a healthy Eric Paschal. And to be honest bringing back Kelly Oubre Jr for the right price it's probably a good move considering he had a terrible first two months of the season and still finished with 15 points average. He adds some necessary size and length off the bench at the forward position.   Don't trade Wiggins, he's only 26 and just really coming into his own. I was in awe at how well he was playing defense in the first half of that Lakers game. Hopefully he can build upon that. However, I feel like we can recreate the 15 and 16 team with Wiggins instead of Harrison Barnes. Wiggins definitely has the higher upside.   But, much of that is riding on whether or not Klay Thompson comes back healthy. Personally, I would never count him out. He has the heart of a champion and is a straight killer. As long as he is still a spot up shooter, we should have a great second option on the perimeter and somebody dangerous that you had better not leave open in order to double team Steph Curry.  We really need to tailor the game plan around Steph Curry getting double teamed, so we can find the open guy and get the best shot. Obviously this will require ball movement and ball security! Emphasize ball security! That has been our Achilles heel.   I'm crossing my fingers that we can add a 4th or 5th pick from Minnesota this year because we can add some talent with an extremely high upside, plus a building block for the future.  The entire league better be on lookout next year because the Warriors are coming full steam ahead."
"If the team medical staff thinks he can’t play , then he shouldn’t play.  Players have huge influence over their personal team.  Way better to miss 1-2 games of the first round when you are the 1 seed than risk a worse re-injury like Klay Thompson &amp; KD in 2019 finals."
That's my Physical Klay Thompson Jr
I fully expect Randle to play better but I also don't expect Burks to continue to play like game 6 Klay Thompson so hopefully it's evened out a bit
Niang looks like Klay Thompson drawn from memory.
I fuck with Cam Reddish but he will not be the difference maker in the trade unless he turns into Klay Thompson or something lol
Burks is a modern day Klay Thompson
"Honestly, Lebron not the greatest choice there as crazy as it sounds. You get to Lebron to play Lebron ball, cause Lebron ball works.  I think you take a healthy Klay Thompson. The man never needs to touch the ball until he shoots, and by then it's too late.   Man I hope Klay is like 90% of what he was. Has anyone in history gotten hot like Klay does?"
I genuinely blame Davis trash bertans and the Beal and Westbrook turnovers for this loss. Bertans thinks he's Klay Thompson or something doing pull up 3s and it kills the entire rhythm they get going of scoring consecutively.
When Klay Thompson is hot you might as well give up
1. 	LeBron James 	1.0000   2. 	Chris Paul 	1.0000    3. 	Kevin Durant 	1.0000   4. 	James Harden 	0.9997   5. 	Stephen Curry 	0.9996   6. 	Russell Westbrook 	0.9993   7. 	Dwight Howard 	0.9973   8.

Virtually every “(Player) &gt; Klay Thompson” take revolve entirely around how the rest of the roster is built
"Seems like a silly way to define ""clutch"" since it's based on an entire game performance. Players will almost certainly benefit from playing on better teams with better players in the playoffs. Teams can scheme to shut down Dame, but not Steph or KD when they play with each other *and* Klay Thompson.  Not hating on you at all though OP, still love the OC and it was a fun read, thanks for the work!"
Klay Thompson &gt; Steph Curry
Never go up 3-2 in a series vs Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson &gt; any shooting guard not named James Harden
"He had more competition prime Cp3 &gt;Westbrook, Nash&gt;Lillard, Tmac&gt;Klay Thompson"
"Klay has some insane highlight moments though. Game 6 Klay immortalizes him, plus his 37 point quarter. I honestly think all Hampton 5 guys plus Shaun Livingston will be remembered just because the Warriors dominance will never be forgotten and those guys are so tied to it. I feel like your average ""true"" NBA fan knows all the 80s Lakers role players for the same reason. Michael Cooper, AC Green, Mychal Thompson, those guys are pretty immortalized as Laker champions."
"Bradley Beal &gt; Klay Thompson  Don’t look at my flair I’m not biased, trust me"
"I think there’s 2 lines of thinking with the “Klay averaged 22 as the third option” thing. There’s your line of thinking (He’s getting held back by the greatness of others) and there’s my way of thinking (he’s in a role that optimizes his strengths while hiding his weaknesses).   Most recently, we’ve seen a guy like Pascal have his reputation somewhat collapse because he didn’t have that baseline of consistent production that’s needed from a number one guy. Klay Thompson in the postseason has had a bunch of terrible games that get swept under the rug because his teammates provided enough production to get the win. His postseason explosions get brought up while his down games / series don’t. If he’s a number one option that doesn’t have that great of a handle and isn’t that great of a playmaker for others, I don’t think he’d be as successful in that role as Kemba is."
klay thompson when his shot is cracked
The main reason OKC lost game 6 was because Klay Thompson had the game of his life
Well the good news is the injury that kept him sidelined at the beginning of his career is seemingly over and his most recent one isn't related to it at all. He played 72 games 2 seasons ago so I'm not really worried about his longterm health. I wouldn't really describe him as injury prone. Klay Thompson was largely seen as an ironman and then tore his ACL out of nowhere so it can happen to anyone.
Prime Kemba Walker &gt; Prime Klay Thompson
Khris Middleton is low key Klay Thompson. Bucks repeat.
He reminds me of a mix between Danny Green and Klay Thompson (obviously no where near as good as either yet) more than anyone. My guess is he'll eventually be a starting 3&amp;D wing for us once we part with either Caris or Brogdon.
"&gt;Curry, who literally transforms a team of bums into 40% 3PT shooters because of his gravity.  You might should double-check that claim.  Curry has played with, last time I counted, 16 different Warrior teammates who shot over 40% from the arc while playing **for other teams.**  That does not include Klay Thompson or Draymond Green, obviously, as they are Warrior lifers to date.  It also doesn't count Andre Iguodala who has not shot 40% yet, and whose best shooting season by a mile was with Philadelphia.  So who, exactly, are these ""bums"" you are referring to?"
"&gt;The irony of you accusing me of talking out of my ass when you just make up half assed statements like your 25% quote.  First off, it's your fault that you got caught incorrectly claiming that open shots no longer exist -- not my fault.  If you don't want to be embarrassed, learn something before I have to explain it to you.  Secondly, watch a game.  Unless it's the Knicks, you will rarely see more than one player per team on the court actually defending, versus just going through the motions.  &gt;None of you stats you chose even back you up. The fact that Klay still shoots well when guarded proves my fucking point you asshat.   Holy hell are you dumber than a stump.  You said that Chamberlain would create open shots for Thompson, and you expected that to make a big difference.  As in all other cases, you were dead wrong, and there's objective evidence to prove it.  Furthermore, 52% effective is not all that great anyway, and that's what Thompson shot closely guarded.  Do us both a favor and learn something.  &gt;The fact that you disagree with the first play being a dribble handoff into a wing pick and roll genuinely shows that you are too stupid to even understand your own evidence.  There is still no dribble handoff preceding that pick. Harper received the ball on a pass from Ewing at the top of the key.  &gt;We both are clearly tiring of this conversation.  I can go on illustrating your complete ignorance for as long as you like.  &gt;KD put up 60 at Rucker  Are you fucking joking?  You think that's evidence?  &gt;and has proven to be one of the most efficient offensive players to ever grace the league.  Again, you are missing the point, unsurprisingly.  Durant has played in the most offense-friendly era in league history.  He's played his 3 most efficient seasons in an offense that could not operate the same way under the rules of basketball.  These issues need to be taken into account, if you are going to compare across eras.  &gt;And Steph is a offensive marvel that experts and players regularly site as one of the most gifted offensive talents of all time.   On the other hand, his career 24 / 6.5 averages are simply very good, and matched or exceeded by a significant number of players.  And even that despite the modern standard for crediting assists being far more generous than it was historically.  And the previously mentioned allowance for running with the ball before shooting, which his predecessors were not allowed.  In any other era, Curry's production would be substantially less, and that's not even questionable.  &gt;You keep telling yourself a different era would see these players be less impactful. Keep telling yourself that because no one else wants to hear it.  I don't care if it upsets you.  The fact of the matter is that these players are assisted tremendously by the pro-offense rules, and the anti-defense attitude of the current league.  You can bury your head in the sand, if you like, but that doesn't make you, or those facts, disappear.  Much like this thread, it just makes you look stupid.  &gt;I genuinely think you are one of the most conceited asshats on this entire subreddit.  You were the one talking a lot of shit, until your ignorance was exposed.  Don't start it if you can't take it.  Better luck next time."
Klay Thompson
"Lol I phrased that terribly, my bad.   I’m saying statistics are not a compete picture and that, when comparing relative difficulty between KD with prime Steph, klay, and dray, and Bron with Kyrie, Klove, and a YMCA B Squad, Bron’s series was more impressive.   Kyrie had a great series and the rest of the team’s play was lifted by his and (more significantly) LeBron’s presence. KD had a great series playing alongside MVP Caliber Steph, DPOY Dray, and Klay Goddamn Thompson.   Comparatively, LeBron in 16 was much more impressive, and arguably more one of a kind when you factor in 3-1."
"Nonsense. Of course Joel was better this year, he was healthy. That’s like saying Joe Harris was better than Klay Thompson."
"Imo it’s Klay Thompson. Homer take, but the dude lived coming off screens, rolling on the weak side, working off handoffs and pin-downs, etc. For someone to get 60 while only dribbling 7 times should be enough proof."
"&gt;Dude maybe you linked the wrong plays.  So you are falling back on this?  That there exists some other play, not mentioned in this thread, which fits your imagined description?  How about you just stop making up nonsense, and wasting my time.  &gt;Also being open in the modern nba does not mean a defender wasn’t rotating, it’s just a metric of where the nearest defender was when the shot was released  Are you even reading this nonsense before posting it?  We all know what an open shot is -- we did not require your half-assed and pointless attempt at an explanation.  That fact remains that wide open shots are commonplace in the NBA today, as proven by the NBA's own statistics.  You were ignorant of that fact, and got caught blathering demonstrably incorrect nonsense about open shots not existing.  &gt;The game is far faster with teams far better at rotating and helping.  No, it's not, and no, they are not.  Which is why so many players get so many wide open shots.  While the players are a little bit lighter on average, since the end of the O'Neal era, only about 25% are even interested in defending.  The rest put in only enough effort to avoid getting benched.  &gt;If klay is always “wide open” in your opinion, what happens when he has fucking Wilt in the paint drawing attention.   Why do you persist in making me illustrate how totally ignorant you are?  It makes almost no difference, is the answer to your question. Last time we saw Thompson, he shot 55.8% effective when wide open, and 52.0% when guarded very tightly -- the latter being a small sample, because he was almost never guarded such.  &gt;Seriously, are you aware of how stupid you sound?  I know precisely how stupid you are... you keep showing us, over and over and over again.  &gt;You are literally trying to argue that a lineup with Steph KD and Wilt couldn’t score  It might help you make less of an asshole out of yourself if you learn to read.  Saying that a team would not be unstoppable is different from saying that they could not score.  &gt;This has to be one of the stupidest conversations I’ve ever had.  From what we've seen of your total ignorance, I bet you've got a long list of candidates for that crown.  Look, learn thing one about the topic at hand before continuing to waste my time here.  Watch a game.  Hell, read an occasional book and become literate."
Klay Alexander Thompson
"There was a lot of debate about him and Irving at the draft, who will be picked up at first and second pick. Such an incredible athlete.  Wonder what happened to him, as in why he didn't continue to become a good player.  Maybe in a different environment like Spurs, he would have thrived.  Just reading some of the comments in the chat about the draft talent.... Interesting what some reports provided on the players including Kemba Walker, Leonard, Klay Thompson, to name a few that went outside the top 5 picks. https://www.nbadraft.net/2011-extended-mock-draft/  Kanter was a top 3 talent and Butler went pick 30. yikes"
"&gt;Dude the first play is straight out of a GSW playbook. It’s a dribble handoff leading into a wing screen and roll.  There's no roll, either.  Watch the play.  Stop imagining.  &gt;And a “open shot” in today’s game is simply a metric, but almost all shots today have a defender rolling.  Yes, a metric that happens all the time, and proves that you have less than zero idea what you are blathering about. Also, defenders don't ""roll"".  One in every six shots by Klay Thompson was wide-open, in his last season.  So either you never watched him play, or you are totally incapable of understanding the proceedings.  Maybe both.  &gt;That first play is a waltz into the paint, where curry would simply shoot the 3 the second he got separation off that pick.   Separation that didn't exist, because as I already explained to you, Olajuwon was all over the ballhandler on that play, and Curry is not shooting over Hakeem.  Again, watch the play.  Stop pretending.  &gt;Again if you can’t see the possibilities of the GSW lineup you are a certified moron.  Anything is possible.  Hell, someday you might even make a correct statement.  That's hugely unlikely, but possible.  On the other hand, we have facts.  And the fact is that the '17 Warriors shot 38.3% from the arc, despite being frequently left wide open, and being allowed to take unlimited steps to set their feet before shooting -- the latter specifically being a modern change to game known as basketball."
if i was an athlete or popular figure i would never be online or just do shit that Klay Thompson does. That dude has it figured out lol.
if he can develop into 24 year old Klay Thompson by age 28 Ill call that a win.
2021: Jrue Holiday/Chris Paul  2020: KCP/Dragic  2019 Klay Thompson/Pascal Siakam   2018 Klay Thompson/JR Smith  2017 Klay Thompson/Kevin Love  2016 Draymond Green/Kevin Love  2015 Draymond Green/Kevin Love  2014 Kawhi Leonard/Chris Bosh  2013 Kawhi Leonard/Chris Bosh  2012 James Harden/Chris Bosh  2011 Ray Allen/Andrew Bynum  2010 Ray Allen/ Andrew Bynum  2009 Rashard Lewis/ Andrew Bynum  2008 Lamar Odom/Ray Allen  The only one I could compare Gordon too is JR smith and that team got swept.
Klay Thompson was an All-Star at age 24 – the same age Duarte is right now.
"He looks NBA ready, I'd say he's probably looking at 7th in our rotation already, and theres hope that he can improve into a Klay Thompson type"
"I agree Simmons and Dray won’t mesh. But I also gotta say a Lillard, Curry, Green backcourt ain’t gonna work AT ALL on defense. Move Green and Harris up 1 spot and get a 4. Even if you’ve gotta start Niang imo. If not Warriors have Simmons to guard Dame and Green to guard Klay. Now the Sixets have Danny Green to guard Curry while Thompson and Porter get to pick on Lillard/ the superior Curry bro. If the Sixers can get a competent PF though I’m taking Sixers in 6."
I think Nwora is the next Klay Thompson
It wasn't just Currys shotting they also had Klay Thompson. Obviously his shooting will increase when there are 2 all time great shooters/scorers on his team.  Durant was clearly the best player in the playoffs when he was on that team. He averaged 35 in the finals on all-time efficiency and you're going to give Curry the credit for that?
Has Russell Westbrook really fallen that far down that he's considered the same level as Pascal Siakam?  Also Klay Thompson is worse than both of them?
"I feel like he needs the rhythm of his dribble to get him going sometimes, but if he turned into a purely a relocate &amp; catch &amp; shoot guy (so...Klay Thompson) in a few years I could see his % climbing."
"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"

Klay Thompson do this life shit.
"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

Klay Thompson if a peak can be a single quarter long.
"I am mostly fine with the tiering; I don’t think harden is tier 1. But I am fucking LIVID klay Thompson is tier 4, that is one of the best two way players in the league pre injury but is also one of the top 5 shooters all time"
"The Hardest Road - Kevin Durant ft. Steph Curry, Klay Thompson,  Draymond Green, Kyrie Irving and James Harden"
"2000 - 2007 Dirk is much more athletic than KP. But not only that, Dirk has better footwork, tighter handles, lower body strength, and a quick first step to get past most guards/wings/big men at that time -- something KP won't be able to do. Dirk in his first 7 years is more like a Giannis/Durant/Klay Thompson hybrid.  2008 - 2019 Dirk is more of a low-post, mid-range, stretch 5 kind of player like Anthony Davis/Carmelo Anthony/LaMarcus Aldridge. I think old-man Dirk is the best comparison to KP given how many injury and mobility issues he already suffered these past few years."
"In my opinion greatness is about achievement. Lebron has achieved a lot.  When you are so physically gifted you can bypass fundamentals. I look at Lebron's play and it seems like he just barrels into the lane and hes so big and agile with such wide shoulders that his opponents can't even get close to him to guard him. Then he shrugs off contact because he's so strong.  It's like.. you can't show his play to a high schooler and say: try to learn to play like that. You can't. Without that body that style of play doesn't  work.   My favorite players to watch have this ridiculous super efficient quick release shot. I have this clip of Duncan Robinson I show people where he basically eliminated the whole phase of a jump shot where you dip the ball. As soon as he receives the ball his feet are set and he's on his way up. It's fundamentals taken to such a high degree of perfection, and I imagine how much work goes into a shot like that.  You could show that to any young player and say: that should be your goal. It's aspirational. I feel the same way about my favorite player to watch: Klay Thompson. When I was young I really liked watching Allen Houston as I always found him to have a ridiculously pretty jump shot."
KD/Dirk  Klay Thompson / Michael Redd  Bradley Beal / Ray Allen  Lowry / Billups
"Does that mean Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green were all negatives? Yeah that makes sense lmao"
"yeah 7 is the Lillard take, maybe not most overrated in the league, but definitely overrated, Trae Young might have caught him by now and the Curry comps are cringe worthy. Hes the classic SG trapped in a PG body, on par with a beal or IT (better than both but still). CJ shoukd have been moved the summer after his breakout season. The two scoring guard team model hasnt won a title since the '90 Pistons and IT and Dumars were lightyears ahead on defense compared to Dame and CJ. (Before anyone mentions Curry and Thompson, Klay is a wing, he got moved to SG to make room for Dray in the lineup)."
"I couldn’t disagree with you more. Literally. It’s not possible. After reading this sub, Klay Thompson may be the most underrated player in the last 20 years. HE PLAYS GOOD DEFENSE TOO!"
"Draymond Green is incredibly overrated. He cannot shoot. He is not a good ball handler. He has little to no post game. He is not a great one on one defender (he has spent his career watching Klay Thompson, Iggy, KD, and others take on the top one or two offensive talents). He is not an above average rebounder. He is a good passer, but his assists are inflated by not being guarded and playing with literally the greatest shooters of all time.   I fully acknowledge his abilities a communicator and as a help defender. He is not, as he arrogantly claims, the best defender of all time, nor really that close. He is a plus role player that is now treated as a star.   There is a reason that when Klay went down, the Warriors became average overnight."
I honestly assumed you must have made a typo and you were talking about someone else.  Reggie Miller is not remotely comparable to Durant.  He's comparable to Klay Thompson.  He's a good player that was fun to watch that never played a season in his entire career where he was a top 10 player in the NBA.
\- Klay Thompson is better than Kyrie Irving as a 3rd star of a superteam  \-Zach Lavine is the best dunker in NBA history  \- Chris Bosh was a superstar before joining the Big 3. He is a better fit than Melo ever would have been for the Big 3.  \- Prime Kawhi (16-17) is better than any Durant season
Klay Thompson is a glorified 3 and D player.
"Klay Thompson is overrated by this sub    Recently somebody posted that he is a first ballot ball of Famer.   His career averages are 19 points, 3.5 rebounds and 2 assists.  And has benefited from never having a defensive set up to stop him. Nor ever having the opposing teams top player have to guard him. Thanks to Curry and Durant.   But what about his defense?   Never won DPOY. Never made the first team All Defense. And only made second team once.   Great shooter. Can explode offensively. And great defender.    But if he spent his career in Sacramento or Memphis, nobody is taking hall of fame or saying he is an All NBA level player.   19 pts, 3.5 rebs, 2 assists and only made 2nd team All Defense one time.   That’s who he is. People on this sub act like he averages 30 a game on 60% shooting and he has four DPOY awards."
Klay Thompson will probably be a shell of his former self once he comes back
"I think yours are really good. I might be a little biased as a Suns fan, but:  **WEST**  1. **Phoenix Suns -** The Suns are bringing back basically the same team with better depth at center (McGee). I think the playoff experience from last year will push the younger guys to reach new heights this season, so I'm expecting big improvements from Ayton, Bridges, Payne, and Johnson. The Suns have an extremely balanced roster and are really deep, but a lot of this hinges on Ayton and Bridges stepping up this season. 2. **Los Angeles Lakers -** I had the Lakers #1 before the Westbrook trade, but I think he makes them worse. I'm never going to discount a team that has LeBron and AD, but the spacing is just awful here with Westbrook, they are one of the oldest teams in history, and Westbrook is extremely ball dominant - the more he has the ball, the less LeBron and AD have the ball. This team just isn't balanced well, although there's a lot of talent at the top. 3. **Utah Jazz -** The Jazz are obviously a great team and improved by bringing Rudy Gay in. They, along with the Suns and Lakers, are in my top tier for this conference and should compete for the #1 seed. I'm still skeptical of their playoff performances and I'm interested to see how Conley does this year. They don't quite have the talent that the Suns and Lakers do, in my opinion. 4. **Golden State Warriors -** I'm actually a little nervous putting the Warriors this high. They ended up 9th last season, so in order for them to get home court advantage, Klay Thompson really needs to come back to full form. After seeing Durant's recovery I believe he can do it. I think having Curry, Green, and Thompson back together will lift the team's morale and push them to be better than they otherwise would be, but they still don't have great depth or big men. Iguodala isn't very good anymore. 5. **Denver Nuggets -** Jokic is amazing and Porter, Jr. should continue to improve, but it's hard to see the Nuggets getting home court advantage with Murray missing most of the season. They are a good team, but were demolished by the Suns - yes, I know Murray was out, but Barton actually played really well when he played and they were just clearly the worse team. 6. **Dallas Mavericks -** I really like the addition of Reggie Bullock. He provides defense and more three-point shooting around Doncic. They still need other creators outside of Doncic, but they should be better than the Blazers and Clippers. I'm interested to see how Porzingis looks this season. 7. **Portland Trail Blazers -** It's really hard to know where to put the Blazers. They didn't really make any roster changes, so I can see Lillard being traded at some point this year, which obviously changes things. With that said, they should still make the playoffs and have a solid starting lineup, even with terrible defense. 8. **Los Angeles Clippers -** I was really surprised that the Clippers retained both Jackson and Batum. Huge win for them. They fought really hard in the playoffs, but I'm not convinced they can play that well (Jackson in particular) for an entire season. This is going to be a tough battle for them, but I think they'd win the Play-In over the Grizzlies or Pelicans. As a Suns fan, I would really hate to play the Clippers in the first round (if the standings work out this way).  **EAST**  1. **Brooklyn Nets -** If the Nets are healthy they have one of the most talented rosters in history, especially since they brought back Griffin and Brown and managed to add Patty Mills. 2. **Milwaukee Bucks -** They have a real shot at defending their title. Just a great, well-rounded team and they have Giannis. 3. **Philadelphia 76ers -** Yes, they lost to the Hawks in the playoffs, but they also had the top seed last year and will be really good again this year. It's going to change based on what happens with Simmons, but they have a lot of talent and should compete if Embiid stays healthy. 4. **Atlanta Hawks -** They had an amazing playoff run last year, Trae Young and the other young guys should continue to get better (especially if Hunter is healthy). They're bringing back essentially the same team and McMillan will have a full season as the coach. 5. **Miami Heat -** Lowry is a great third-man after Butler and Adebayo. If healthy they've proven they can be a really good team and win in the playoffs.  6. **New York Knicks -** The Knicks surprised everyone last year and then improved their team this year. They only had three guys that could score 20 points in a playoff game last year (Randle, Rose, and Barrett), but just added two more (Walker and Fournier). If healthy, they've really shored up their shot creation issues and should be much better in the playoffs. 7. **Chicago Bulls -** The Bulls added a lot of talent and will have a full training camp to get Vucevic incorporated. The defense is awful, but they will be really good on offense. LaVine took a huge step last year, but now he has Ball and DeRozan to take some pressure off of him. 8. **Boston Celtics -** Schroder was a great signing, but I just don't see how the Celtics are any better than last year, while other teams got better. Tatum and Brown are amazing, but the rest of the roster is just meh. I think those two are good enough to sneak into the playoffs, but they could have a tough time against the Hornets, Pacers, or even the Wizards."
dame can make the playoffs without klay thompson
60 points on 56 shots (including attempts that led to free throws) is not inefficient. It's pretty average and the fact that he could do that on such high volume makes it a good game from him. Also who gives a fuck about rebounds for non bigs. That'd be like me saying Klay Thompson didn't have a great game when he broke the 3pt record bc he only grabbed 4 boards.   I'm far from a kobe stan but this logic is wack
"Ugh.  How am I making anything up?    These are literally the words of reporters like Anthony Slater, Tim Kawakami, Zach Lowe, etc etc who talk with the Warriors FO regularly.  But dude, you watched some Wiggins games since the beginning so I'm making shit up.  Cool.      And Curry has a minimum of 4 to 5 years of top NBA production.  This implication that he's only got 1 or 2 seasons left is just ignorant and silly.  We have Chris Paul being a main contributor on a Finals team and he never had the shooting skills or offensive impact Curry has (ldo).  The Warriors FO doesn't want to give up their future, depth, etc for a move that they feel likely doesn't win them a title.  I personally can't fault them for that as they have the assets to make a move like that... they just don't have that star available to grab ATM.      And they didn't make the post-season because of the play-in but more importantly because they had 40 million in Klay Thompson missing the entire season.  We saw what happened to the Lakers when AD and Lebron missed significant time.  The Warriors and any other NBA team aren't any different (outside of probably the Nets)."
"I've been watching and reading about this Detroit team and it is crazy how good they were  Realistically one call away from a 3-peat, and they don't get enough respect for how good IT and especially Dumars were on offense. Dumars was a consistent all-Defense player and would've been a Klay Thompson like, possibly better, player in todays game (40% on 5.8 3PA his final season, with the 3pt line back to normal)"
"Paul Pierce: *Celebrity Sports Showdown,* but he only plays as Avril Lavigne  Kawhi Leonard: Running benchmarks  Klay Thompson: *Don Bradman Cricket '17* or *Katamari Damacy* depending on indica vs. sativa  Michael Jordan: 36 PokerStars rooms on monitors 1-3 and *Jordan Vs. Bird: One on One* on monitor 4  btw, that LeBron + Raid is one of the best jokes I've ever seen on this sub"
"Based on the spurs diagnosis, Kawhi's options were either play through the pain or retire. His quad problem would never go away even if he did no serious physical activity for a year.  It's not the player's word, it's the doctors word. Guys like John Wall and Klay Thompson got serious injuries that have known timelines to recover from. Kawhi had a chronic injury that would never go away."
biggest star that could still reasonably be called 3&amp;D would probably be Klay Thompson. beyond that they are not 3&amp;D archetype players.
"Why would you clear someone to play when you know he has a chronic injury and he says he doesn't feel well when he is playing out there?  How do you know the extent of pain in his body when he is forcing himself on the court? How can you judge that he can play thru it and when?  And why not keep all that inhouse?    What about the whole fan base going after him as the lier, traitor, thief...     Did any such thing ever happen in any other franchise? Several players like John Wall, Klay Thompson got year long injuries, has any franchise announced that the player was cleared now, he can actually play? It's always the player's word."
klay thompson
"Yeah same here. A lot of people were saying it was because KD was more skill-based when it came to his game, even though   1. He's basically a 7 footer 2. He moves around the court quickly and does a lot of fast movements.  I thought for sure he would come back missing a step, look slower but nope. Had one of his best seasons of his career.  However this has led to a lot of people thinking Klay Thompson can also come back from his injuries, which he obviously can but tearing an Achilles and an ACL?  If I'm wrong then  I'm wrong but he definitely wont be the same, at least on defense."
Klay thompson if he is healthy again and got his rhythm back
"Klay Thompson is the apex 3-and-D player.   Guys like Paul George and Kawhi can play defense and shoot, but they can do so much more."
"Steph chances are already close, he hasn’t been in the playoffs in 2 years. People talking about klay Thompson, a guy who’s suffered the two worst injuries a basketball player outside of back issues, in can back to back seasons. He’s never going back to the player he was before"
"I prefer players who doesn’t rely on athletic ability. I like those who rely on shooting ability, deceptive movement, and skilled ways to create separation. Most importantly, I want a player who is great at the defensive end. I enjoyed watching Klay Thompson pre-injury but I’m not sure how he’ll be after not playing for two full seasons.  Also, I dislike players who doesn’t have the competitive mindset to stop themselves from calling other star or franchise players to form super teams. I like Giannis as well for this reason."
Klay Thompson
"If Klay Thompson can't go (or takes 2-3 years to find his form), Warriors aren't a championship squad by any means."
"&gt; edit: to put that in context, Paul Pierce and Kyrie Irving have each made 2nd team only once. Kyle Lowry, Jimmy Butler, and Klay Thompson have never done it.  that should tell you more about how weird selections are than about how good he must have been"
"&gt;Because shooting the basketball well is the most fundamental part of playing a GOAT basketball game, or even a good basketball game.  He had a TS of 61% because he was so efficient at the line. You can’t just exclude an important part of the sport to create a narrative that he was inefficient in the Finals.  &gt;Yea he was great in the other rounds, but not the finals.  He averaged 28.5/10/4 a game that series, might not be as good as his numbers in the other series but that is still great.  &gt; It's not like he did anything else special with his playmaking or rebounding or defensively. Klay Thompson was lighting him up. What was GOATish about his finals?  He averaged 10 boards a game that series, and he wasn’t even guarding Klay most of the time. Nobody said he was “GOATish” in the Finals, in fact I specifically said he didn’t even have a top 3 best playoff run ever. The argument you’re making against it holds no weight though."
They should trade klay thompson while he still has value because once he plays a game or two nobody is going to want to touch that contract.
Bad roster builder but OKC took a 3-1 lead In the WCF against the winningest team in history and probably would have swept the Cavs if Klay Thompson didn't go nuclear and KD himself didn't choke...but ok.
"Because shooting the basketball well is the most fundamental part of playing a GOAT basketball game, or even a good basketball game. It's not like he did anything else special with his playmaking or rebounding or defensively. Klay Thompson was lighting him up. What was GOATish about his finals?  Moreover, he got to the line with constant, ridiculous offensive fouls it's not like he was getting hacked or grabbed.   Yea he was great in the other rounds, but not the finals."
I’m so tired of the overreactions from a few Summer League Games. It’s like when people call Trey Murphy the next KD which is absolutely ridiculously. He’s clearly just a taller more athletic Klay Thompson.
"I agree with you mostly, but Ben's drive and kick create some of the most open three point looks in the entire league. The thought of him having Klay Thompson to pass out to, instead of Mike Scott, is definitely appealing, if you think you can fix some of his other issues."
He also said he was a better wing shooter than klay thompson lol
Maybe if she is the girl version of klay Thompson and can just bomb 3's she could make it
"manu ginobili, james worthy,klay thompson"
"Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Andre Iguodala, Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo, Damian Lillard  Edit: Marc and Pau Gasol"
"This is my stance on it, too, and why I’ve always been kind of a “Big Hall” proponent. I wish it was a tiny bit more restrictive (especially with international players…does Vlade Divac really have to be in the Hall of Fame?), but I like that it honors guys who were great players in their day but maybe not quite the true superstars that a “Small Hall” would limit it to.  I like that it honors guys like Jack Sikma, David Thompson, Chris Webber, Adrian Dantley, etc., who weren’t the type of true, next-level superstars that some people would like to restrict it to, but who were great players nonetheless.   We all know the Kareems, the Birds, the Jordans, etc., so I like having kind of a historical reference for the guys who weren’t quite at that level, who were maybe just the Paul Georges and Klay Thompsons and Jimmy Butlers of their era, and it makes me look forward to seeing those guys of our era receive that honor someday, too."
This is klay Thompson
Reminds me of the Draymond Green and Klay Thompson role player jokes
"It's true. The AAU scene in America has really fucked up youth basketball and their perspectives of themselves as well as other competition.   Nico will get more practical experience in Italy than he would riding the bench for the Warriors, or even playing for Santa Cruz. He'll have to learn how to be a legitimate professional, and that alone will be a huge help to him when (or possibly ""if"", if he enjoys playing overseas enough and the money is there) he comes back to the NBA.   Way better than suffering in the NBA, never being able to show your stuff because you're playing behind Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, and then never truly maximizing your earning potential."
Haha I appreciate klay Thompson at least
lol shit am I? …am I Klay Thompson?
"Or maybe you are biased? Maybe the team made a mistake? I'm not sure. My point is that it's been clear for the last year that jalen is really good. I remember everyone being critical of klay thompson but being from the northwest, I watched his games. I knew he would be great. Biased? Absolutely. I also know what I see."
So your one of those off ball playmakers are a thing kinda guy huh 🤔 does that mean Duncan Robinson is a playmaker is klay Thompson a playmaker? I don’t think so shooting gravity isn’t playmaking imo.
"I had similar thoughts too, Gelo already has an nba level jumper, he just needs to learn the defensive schemes and work on his offball game and he could be a solid 3&amp;D catch and shoot type of player off the bench. Basically Duncan Robinson/poor mans Klay Thompson archetype like you said"
"Draymonds offense has gotten significantly worse since 2016, even though his defense might be just as good.  BUT even if it is as good I personally think it is less valuable than it was back then since the league has gone far more perimeter oriented.   Klay Thompson is a huge question mark this year since he is coming off 2 consecutive missed seasons with huge injuries.   Andre Iguodala was a huge reason the Warriors were so good, but he has looked pretty old for a while now.   Andrew bogut was tremendous for the warriors and Festus Ezeli provided them with really really good minutes as a backup.  Looney is good, but not as good as Bogut was and Wiseman may not even make a positive impact this year.   Shaun Livingston was a very important piece off the bench that provided, scoring, defense and playmaking when Steph was out.  Jordan Poole proved last year to be a very effective scorer, but maybe still questionable as play maker and very very questionable on defense.   Steph is still Steph though so that is good.   The warriors could very well be contenders this year, but it depends on the health of Klay Thompson and whether or not their rookies (I am including Wiseman here) can contribute.  2016 had good depth without relying on any rookies."
"Honestly it feels like the league in general wants a trade to go down. Especially a Siakam to the Warriors trade - just to spice things up!   Even if Klay comes back 60-70% of how he was pre-injury a Siakam-Green-Thompson-Curry is an instant title contender imo. Siakam is an open court beast who would feast with spacing he'd get from Curry/Klay, as well as being the ultimate pressure relief for Curry double teams. He can knock down open 3's and guard positions 1-5.... literally the perfect fit.   Thing is I don't know if the Raptors are willing to take anything less than Wiseman-Wiggins-Kuminga...and I don't know if the warriors are willing to part with their potential future core. Decisions, decisions."
It's funny that he is practicing catch and shoot 3s like he is Klay Thompson. No one respects his shot. He can just walk up to the line and shoot. There is no need to make it more complicated.
But are the toasters autographed by Klay Thompson?
A Lakers fan is gonna talk about “poor spacing” for a team with fuckin Steph Curry and Klay Thompson? 🤔
It was only 4 games. Jimmy had the worst series of his life. Bam played horrible too. Jrue was huge that series. So was Tucker. Ariza was trash. Crowder was missed. Herro was horrendous. Bryn Forbes was Klay Thompson. Keep building narratives around 4 game sample sizes rather than using your head. It's like you think the moment fans are out of the equation everything becomes easy
"Maybe I should say 3 best players. I don't think anybody that isn't overdosing on crack would argue that. Let's break down some facts. Mpj had the second most efficient 20 point season of all time last season (look it up). Jamal Murray was putting up stats comparable to Devin Booker and Donavon Mitchell, what non crack head would aregure that they aren't max players? Mpj and Mal have missed less time over the last 3 seasons than Klay Thompson. Is Klay Thompson an overpaid broken toy?"
Klay Thompson has a lot of quotes for a guy who hasn't picked up a basketball in 2 years.
"Klay ""Pregante"" Thompson"
"not sure if you're a troll, but I'll bite -   in his previous two healthy seasons, klay put up about 21-4-2 on 47/42/82 while playing great defense &amp; not needing the ball in his hands.   i'm not entirely sure why you used career numbers when obviously rookie klay isn't indicative of him as a player rn   the warriors rn look like one of the best teams in the league, and you think it won't matter that they're adding klay thompson to their roster? I think that makes you a clown more than anyone you're calling out lol"
What absolute donkey actually asked Klay Thompson if he thought the warriors could win this year
Don't tell Klay Thompson of all people to do a suicide.
"I think Klay Thompson might be the biggest Klay Thompson fan in the league, always talking about Klay Thompson"
"Keep Westbrook.  Trade James to Cleveland for K-Love.  Grab Cassius Stanley and Dorsey and a bunch of other fuckers born in LA.  Trade Unibrow for Lonzo Ball.  Hire Steve Lavin as head coach.    Trade all the other pieces for Klay Thompson. Then sign Jason Kapono. Make both Kapono and Thompson wear headbands, and let the announcers try to figure out which one is which.   Lose Championship #18 to the Hornets in 5."
Steve Kerr on Klay Thompson scrimmaging:   *'This is news to me.'*
Should we be concerned about Klay Thompson?
"Pretty rare that you're the 2nd greatest shooter of all time too, but anyway just watch. You'll see.  Imagine doubting Klay Thompson lol"
"Klay ""ya'll must'ove forgot"" Thompson revenge tour incoming."
"Less Klay Thompson tik tok videos in the front page, like how the fck are they upvoted thousands times when theres 0 substance in those videos. Also Klay is a petty mfer, can tell from the way he gets mad when he is missed on the 75 all time and the time  when he missed all nba"
"I for some reason, fucking hate Klay Thompson."
joe harris isnt the first player to underperform. you cant rely  on star players either. jrue holiday had a terrible series against us and so did klay thompson many times for the warriors. curry choked in 2016 and so did klay. lebron in 2011. westbrook over his entire career. people have bad series.
Klay Thompson wants championships like Zion wants a buffet
"Klay is such a joy to watch. I watched this video from GSW YouTube the other day: [""Six Times Klay Thompson Broke the Game of Basketball""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H0f5PIiIiI) It really made me emotional tbh.  And especially to see the trio of Steph, Klay, and Draymond, all healthy on the court together again, on a competitive team. I've been looking forward to this for a long time."
"You could also make a case the Warriors have been playing ""amputated"" all season without Klay Thompson though."
"Klay ""The Midwife"" Thompson"
Can't wait when teams go to double team Steph in the pnr and forget that Klay fucking Thompson is sitting in the corner again.
I have a theory this entire post was created so you could call Klay Thompson Squidward's House
I hope Klay Thompson can't come back and ultimately retires. So we don't have to see stupid stuff he says or does ever again.
"Klay Thompson forgot the Warriors were a team when he got drafted. If Zion turned NOLA into a great team, the franchise wouldn't be forgotten.  And with success, writers would find their narratives. ""Zion is saving this franchise"" or ""Zion is doing what AD couldn't"" or whatever. Hometown hero isn't the only narrative that works."
"I want Klay Thompson to suck when he comes back. I grew out of my warriors hate and love Steph now, but I just want to see klay fail to spite the “Choccy milk he’s high!!! 420!!!” Nephews on this sub.  Also I hope the Spurs suck forever"
2021 Wiggins is better than 2016 Barnes because Wiggins is our best perimeter defender and a little bit better at creating his own shot. I would say 2021 Barnes is better than 2021 Wiggins though. Barnes has really improved his game as he's gotten more opportunities to be a focal point of an offense.  The main reason the 2016 team is better than the 2021 team is because the 2021 team doesnt have prime Klay Thompson and probably never will.
"&gt; Like yeah, opposing teams used to target him on defense, but the list of players who wouldn't be the weak link when the rest of the lineup is Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala is what you might call limited.  I mean, obviously you don't watch games, but you could at least read what you're replying to."
"Steph Curry's defense is severely underrated.  Like yeah, opposing teams used to target him on defense, but the list of players who *wouldn't* be the weak link when the rest of the lineup is Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala is what you might call *limited*."
Why not scarier?  The Warriors without Melo are already looking like they could be comparable to the Duncan-era Spurs.  The #1 seed in the league + Klay Thompson + LaMelo Ball.
"Sure, if all Klay was pre his injuries was a great 3pt shooter who wasn't going to be run off the floor. But Klay Thompson wasn't an all-star just because of his shooting.  I expect Klay's defense and overall game to be worse. But I would be surprised if Klay wasn't an elite shooter and passable defensively."
"Suns have an easier schedule, worse record and much worse point differential. Warriors are also missing Klay Thompson, who even if he's not himself is still a 40% 3pt shooter who is not a defensive liability."
"I’m not saying any sort of help isn’t double teams, I said that not switching the screen and playing a two man trap is a double team, your doubling the ball handler on the pick and roll, that definitely counts some, the Raptors and other teams use lots of double traps. The Raptors don’t have a traditional rim protector so they do a lot of extra help on drives, but this is not a double or triple team in the half court as a set, it’s just a help reacting, and it’s not bring up a corner of a box and one to double like what was done in the finals.  But the most important point is that steph drove much less than Poole and Wiggins this game and those guys got helped in a bunch, the help also usually leaves immediately so it’s again not really an actual scheme to double or triple, Wiggins and Poole got that treatment more than steph did, because of how often steph was out of the plays with Vanvleet on him. These open looks were majority from breaking the box zone, not from just above the break doubles on steph, and there was mo point where the Raptors purposefully tripled steph above the break, they just never did it an no team does that.   But the extra point is that “nah nah your traps and triple teams on steph aren’t gonna work this time” comments just don’t understand what was actually going on in the finals or the difference in this game. Steph curry still had klay thompson on the floor and they box and 1 him in the finals. That box and one worked because the ability of the box to stay in front of their man while also being ready to help, the warriors couldn’t break the zone, they broke the zone this game with wing and pooled first step and handle which got them deep into the paint. These constant 3 point looks being generated were from that.   I go through this in another comment talking about the 4th quarter and the 3s that ended the Raptors run and essentially closed the game. All of those steph was 1v1 the entire time. And the open looks were created by others driving.   “Steph got double teamed every play and the warriors got free 3 pointers” is just not something the Raptors we’re doing this game, and it’s not how those 3s were getting generated for a lot of the game."
Klay Thompson?
Warriors will be happy if klay Thompson plays like joe Harris coming back from those injuries.
&gt;Bulls and nets were down more players and important one.   Lolwut  Today I learned Nets fans think Vucevic and Harris are more important than Klay fuckin Thompson.
"ok, still didnt have Klay Thompson for either of those games."
And the Warriors were without Klay Thompson and James Wiseman. Damion Lee was also out for the Bulls game
Klay Thompson and JJ Redick
"I don't understand why they make this so complicated. The purpose of a salary cap is to keep each team competitive. If a player isn't playing, why should it count against the cap? We lost Klay Thompson for 2 years. IMHO, we should have been able to sign other players with that money for those 2 years. Why penalize teams for injuries?"
https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Klay-Thompson-Jackie-Moon-Halloween-costume-Oracle-13353142.php#photo-16428905
"&gt; Also calling him a role player is funny  How is calling him a role player funny or even a knock on him? We all know how godly Klay Thompson can be but he's probably the greatest role player of all time. It's not a knock on who he is as a player or his job. He plays the role of a 3&amp;D shooter and he plays that role very well. Nobody asks him of more than that, which by definition makes him a role player. I could see how people could make the same argument for Wiggins, especially in Golden State."
"Like the guy said, it’s Klay Thompson.. you don’t try to figure out who the starter should be when you’re discussing Klay Thompson."
Even the warrior then would win had klay Thompson played through the series fully healthy
We still talking about zaza in the year 2021? Warriors are 15-2 without Klay Thompson or a physical center. Miss me with this very dumb take. Lebron punched a man this is a national crisis
"LeBron is just a bitter old man. He only won 4 championships and he’s not going to match MJ any more because he made a foolish trade for Westbrook. To top it off, he has to go watch Stephen Curry out there having fun and winning with Andrew Wiggins, who he personally traded to the Timberwolves for Kevin Love, who was a massive bust in his time with the Cavs and who didn’t help him beat the aforementioned Stephen Curry who was out there having fun and winning with Klay Thompson, who the Warriors passed up trading for the aforementioned Kevin Love."
It’s Klay Thompson dog
"Yeah, I mean, Curry had an off night, but as you said, the entire team was geared on shutting down his shot attempts. He played that game and dragged as much focus as he could, and there you go, Wiggins had a crazy efficient night and Poole looks like Klay Thompson.   I think that people are gonna think Curry had a bad game, but it was really interesting seeing him negotiate the doubles, the constant collapsing, and just being unselfish."
"Sadly, [Steve Kerr has confirmed](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-steve-kerr-hasnt-been-told-klay-thompson-cleared-practice) that Klay has ***not*** been cleared for full team practice yet, saying he doesn't know where that report came from.  Still holding out hope for a Klay return as a Christmas present."
*Me*: We were missing OG Anunoby  *Me in the back of my mind*: They were missing Klay Thompson
“Klay Thompson is ready to play.” -Klay Thompson
"Depends on your teams structure. Lonzo is like Klay Thompson if he was a worse shooter but a great playmaker. Can’t rely on Lonzo to create anything off the dribble consistently. If you’ve got multiple other ball handlers on your roster, then Lonzo. If you need a lead ball handler, then Fox."
"Klay ""Fuck the Kings"" Thompson"
Sort of.During a Golden State Warriors Washignton Wizards game a fight broke out between Bradley Beal and Draymond Green.During the brawl Kelly Oubre Junior threw a Punch a Klay Thompson as Klay was playing peacemaker.Thankfully Kelly missed and if I'm not mistaken accidently punched John Wall.
"Your sentence made no sense. He was not there last year as you proceed to explain how is he is there in Payton.   Your just helping me prove my case. They got rid of non fits  and added players that do. Why would I, if I had a vote, vote for someone that got exactly what he needs to verse the guy who lost things he needed.   The nets have no kyrie. It's not the same as klay Thompson because kerr has had 2 and a half seasons to adjust.   The coach of the year doesn't go to the guy with the best record  but the guy who unsprisingly got his team to win majority of the times."
"Even as a huge KD fan this is going too far  Steph and KD basically cancel each other out  So now we have Kyrie, KLove, Tristan Thompson and JR Smith vs. LeBron, Klay, Dray, and Iggy  Yikes"
The NBA needs klay thompson back
"Golden State Warriors star Klay Thompson ""came through well after a week of 5-on-5 scrimmaging and has been cleared to be a full-time participant"" in the team's practices going forward, according to [Shams Charania and Anthony Slater](https://theathletic.com/news/warriors-klay-thompson-cleared-to-practice-fully-could-return-within-week-of-christmas-sources/iEKeYCOtl4px/) of The Athletic.  Per that report, Thompson ""is trending toward Christmas return    Let's fucking go!!"
"Curry should have won MVP.  First, LeBron did not deserve any MVP votes. His effort was honorable, but at 47 TS% he scored wildly inefficiently and did not play at a high enough level to win the series. The deck was stacked against him of course, but he did not come close to beating the stacked deck.  So then it comes down to what Warrior should win, Steph or Iguodala.   Now the case for Iguodala would be that his defense is what made LeBron score inefficiently. The case against that would be that LeBron had no help and the Warriors could focus their entire defense to stopping him like the Spurs did in 2007.  In this interpretation, while Iguodala’s defense was important on-ball, Draymond and some other guys interior defense was more important at stopping LeBron. What we would learn about the Warriors defense in future seasons, including this year, would lend itself to that for this point.  Then you just look at a simple stat comparison. Curry scored 9.7 more points on only 0.3% lower TS%. Had 0.6 less rebounds per game, 2.3 more assists, and .5 more steals, while his gravity and the Cavs double teams are what opened up the Warriors offense for guys like Iguodala to score easier.  Then add on his defense where JR Smith (42.4 TS%), Shumpert (39.7 TS%), and Dellavedova (38.9 TS%) got put in jail by Steph and Klay for the series, preventing “the others” from killing the Warriors.  The two most efficient scorers on the Cavs were Mozgov (14 points on 63.1 TS%) and Thompson (10 points on 52.8 TS%). Was Mozgov actually Mozgod? Now Lakers fans would tell you Mozgov actually isn’t that good…and the explanation for these guys being the Cavs best help offense is that the bigs (Bogut, Draymond, Ezeli) we’re playing off their man to give help to stop LeBron drives which further drives the point that stoping LeBron was a team effort."
Rumor has it that Klay Thompson is responsible for all those awards...
"No, that still probably goes to the 84 class, that's why I said those two are one of the best, and I did not say the best. If you look at who was drafted in those classes it's hard to argue that they're not one of the best drafts classes . Steph Curry, James Harden, DeMar DeRozan, Blake Griffin, kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, Kawai Leonard, Jimmy Butler all came from either the 09 or 11 draft class."
mf said mcgrady and KLAY THOMPSON over Michael Jordan wtf lmao
The disrespect. Even left off the Klay Thompson at pick number 11.
Every team thought they have a steph curry and klay Thompson.
"Your right Harrell wouldn't be unplayable, Kuz wouldn't be consistent, and KCP would've turned into Klay Thompson if not traded."
Is that Josh Richardson or Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson was what carried them in that series not Curry.  And when he went out he couldn’t buy a basket and threw away the most pivotal game of the series. It’s indisputable.
Out for Golden State  * Steph Curry  * Draymond Green  * Andre Iguodala  * Klay Thompson  * Otto Porter  * James Wiseman
Well in 2019 he was outplayed by Klay Thompson and then when Klay was injured he managed to go 1/6 in a crucial 4 quarter of a must wins finals game.   In 2015 he was worse than Iggy. Doesn’t that tell you everything you need to know?  And do we even need to talk about 2016? Or is that self explanatory?
"The Lakers just *barely* beat a far worse constructed Warriors team in the play-in last season **with** LeBron (Curry had 37 and was a +4 in that game which they lost by 3).   Now the Warriors are playing like they were before KD *and* Klay Thompson is still coming back, plus a true 7 footer who will throw down those dunks that are pump fakes for Looney.   I really hope we get a Warriors/Lakers playoff series this year."
Klay Thompson the infamous paint monster
Klay Thompson and Stockton on all strength? Huh?
The only reason he isn't the universal GOAT off ball player is because there is another guy that can do that equally well and that guy happens to be his teammate and fellow splash brother Klay Thompson lol. But yeah Klay and Steph together running off ball is unguardable

"Because Ima Cavs fan who hated his arrogance. Just found him annoying (as well as the whole Warriors team minus Steve Kerr who I love, and Klay Thompson).   And he is the most frustrating player to play against. You can play great defense then have him destroy you from 30 feet."
"- Both Kyrie Irving &amp; Ben Simmons will return to play before the All-Star break.   - The Grizzlies will go on a fire sale at the trade deadline.  - Either the Celtics or Knicks will miss the play-in tournament.  - Klay Thompson and James Wiseman will make the Warriors slightly worse in the short term but both will be starters by the start of the playoffs.  - Lakers will look fine after LeBron comes back, but will inevitably be upset in the 2nd Round."
And guess what. They still gotta add klay mf thompson to this team….
"Everybody? You sure? Klay Thompson was essentially in the exact situation. He was on the Warriors and had a massive injury that would take a year to recover from. Still he signed a new contract in July 2019, right after the injury, to stay with the Warriors.   Shouldn’t Klay have gone to Brooklyn?"
Steph only won with Draymond and Klay Thompson due to Kevin love and Kyrie Irving being injured in the finals when they won.  They would’ve lost that year to a fully healthy cavs team like they did the next year. This is why they needed Durant. They never win another ring without him.
"Again who are the warriors playing without klay Thompson right now, and their second leading scorer. Wiggins   Where did the super athletic 20 ppg Wiggins come from? Thin ice ? No Kevin durant signing and trading.   I literally have a list how the new warriors core was formulated  lol. Before warriors fans go welllll we could of signed another star after durant left..   Nope your over the cap after klay steph draymond max contracts. You had bird rights on kevin durant which allowed you to go over the cap.   -&gt; Kevin durant sustained the warriors dynasty"
"It's funny how the NBA thinks the Warriors as a team revolutionized the 3-ball, when in reality it was just purely Stephen Curry. Even during the championship years, the Warriors role players (outside of Klay) were below-average shooters.   Even Klay Thompson wasn't an outlier. He's never made more than 300 threes in season. His volume falls more in line with previous sharpshooters we've seen before in NBA history.  Curry is main outlier that we've never witnessed before."
"&gt; I don't think there was ever a time when Drummond was good enough to be playing 30+ MPG and averaging 16 PPG on a great team.  This is definitely an interesting point. If he had Chris Paul and Klay Thompson on his team in his prime, could Drummond have been a legit impactful star? Good chance imo. But yeah when you consider what he actually was, he was a good box score guy who wasn’t great on defense and was limited offensively."
"What? When did they lose? You mean to the raptors? If so I think your leaving out some crucial details bud, you know kind of how like Kevin’s Durant and klay Thompson didn’t play in the finals lmao without those two they still took the raptors to 6 games."
Like tonight except with Klay Thompson too
"Oh man yeah, he was a 3rd pick -- he didn't play a minute at Kentucky either.   That draft is so weird -- Kyrie Irving was super injured at Duke, went 1, Kanter didn't play, went 3. Then the rest is like Derrick Williams, Tristan Thompson, Jan Vesely, Bismack Biyombo.... and somehow, Kemba, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, Isaiah Thomas, Kawhi and Nikola Vucevic went behind these guys."
"Oh right silly me, KD wasn’t missed and his production is something that can be replicated. Good point on KD not being a factor.   Klay Thompson played 188 minutes when Curry and Green played about 250 minutes. Klay was missed in those 60+ minutes that he could have shared the court with them."
"Hahah never thought of it that way but its hilarious. In case of Klay Thompson it would sort of make sense as well, seems like the guy to just be driftin off and then afterwards be like 'what just happened'?"
"Right now (Nov 18 before any games played today), the West is collectively 106-112 and the East is 117-111 so the East has a better record against the West. This is being done even though the West has played 119 home games and the East has only played 104 home games. Several Eastern Conference teams have already make significant West Coast road trips (which is why teams like the Lakers, Clippers, and Warriors have played 12, 10, and 9 home games respectively).   I haven't tried to add up who has missed more games. Yes, the West is missing notable players like Jamal Murray, Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, and LeBron has missed time too. But the East has no Kyrie, Ben Simmons (who is very solid in the regular season regardless of his playoff issues), and the Bucks has been playing a mash unit a lot with all their top 4 missing time."
"Well, he had a bit unusual career path - since he played with Durant to start his career. Most talented young players don't get to spend start of their career next to all-time great player. Even then you could see some faults in Russ game - but since he was not the best player on his team it was bit contained and he gave more effort on defensive end. It is not even that Durant papered over those cracks, it was just that Russ had bit of a smaller role than lone superstar tend to get.  When KD left he was ""unleashed"" - and for that first season he was good. But in later seasons cracks in his game just stopped being worth it and he stopped trying on defense. Even when he has a good scoring/playmaking night these days you have to wonder if it's worth disaster class he is putting on the defensive end most of the time.  This is not really rare case in basketball - if Klay Thompson was asked to be best player on a team I would guess that would end in a disaster, still I will always call Klay a great player. Problem with Russ is that his playstyle only works if he is be all end all for his team, but he is not good enough to be be all end all anymore - weird position and at this point I doubt he will try to develop skills that let him be useful otherwise."
Ant has that klay thompson shit in him where he just gets hot as shit out of no where
"We talking Klay ""ain't no way I'm not top 75 all time"" Thompson here, man's coming back with fire in his ass to put the league on notice"
Curry has led some historic offensive teams even before KD arrived in 2017. Right now the Warriors have the best offense in the league and Klay Thompson still not even playing.
Klay rat cock Thompson
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"If he's actually injured/sick, then he could still be paid. The same way Klay Thompson is paid even though he's injured, and Khris Middleton is paid even though he's sick.   The disagreement is over whether he's actually injured/sick. And there's probably certain procedures that have to be followed for whatever the NBA's version of ""calling out sick"" is."
Steven Curry is a FRAUD riding on the coattails of the GREAT Klay Thompson and Zach LaVine!  !!
"Most of these are rather sensible takes, I also don't follow many of those teams as closely so I don't have much to nitpick.     Coming to the warriors take-  1. Poole- I completely agree that he will be inconsistent, it is likely though that he will be as sporadic as he is right now, unlike many other teams we have a competent coaching staff, his shoot selection will change to have many more drives, and they will probably not keep him in the corners. This change could be seen in the nets game itself.   He will probably end up being a 15 pt scorer with decentish effiecncy which is good enough considering the Warriors D.   Not to mention his shooting woes are more confidence related than based on technique, I am sure his 3 would be 35% by the year end 2. Wiseman is raw yes, I doubt he would have the issues you claimed he would, since that is not the fit he will be run in. I imagine that looney will be retaining his starting and closing minutes, Wiseman would probably take minutes from when the warriors play a wing as a pseudo 5 and mainly used as a rim running threat in our smaller lineups.  3. The Klay Thompson is flat disrespectful and honestly dumb, I expect Klay to retain all his shooting chops, note he doesn't rely on the jump a lot and barely dribbles and become an above-average defender instead of being an elite one. This means a few things i) He provides more much spacing for the warriors which easier cuts for a draymond or wiggins or anyone for that matter. ii) Less double teams for Steph especially of the switch and most importantly iii) less Poole/Lee minutes.    4. An 70% Klay is a bigger contributor than most All Star Replacements due to his perfect fit in the warriors system. The issue with all your warriors takes is that they are imagined in the void rather the style in which warriors play ball"
Or hot Klay Thompson
Gah damn those are klay Thompson numbers
"So true. Klank Thompson still exists, but his evil twin Goatee Klay shows up for half the season and absolutely wets every shot to make him look better"
Klay Thompson was not a bad contract no one realized he would be injured like this
"Tristan Thompson was not close to average defensively in 2016. The Warriors had Draymond, KD Iggy and Klay on defense. Looney and Javale were also a lot less exploitable than Jokic."
RoCo doesn't play defense like Klay does though. RoCo is more of an off ball and help defender while Thompson is an on ball guy.
"and Klay thompson has had better playoff performances than Jokic, Dame, and Luka, so maybe you’re just an r/nba shleep?"
Giannis over Harden and Klay Thompson at 7 is very questionable at the very least
"Klay Thompson over Jokic, Dame and Luka might be the worst take I’ve seen on this forum so far."
1. steph 2. KD 3. Giannis 4. Harden 5. LeBron 6. Kyrie 7. Klay Thompson 8. Kawhi 9. Jokic 10. Dame  &amp;#x200B;  edit: provided health
"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Jokic would feast any lineup in the league  or steph, klay, kd, draymond, AD if you cared about defense"
"Ah, yes, and they used said lottery picks on *checks*  Ekpe Udoh, Klay Thompson, and Harrison Barnes."
I think adding pre injury Klay Thompson to any legit contender (which nuggets are) turns them into an immediate title threat.
Any current contending team adding a healthy Klay thompson would instantly vault them to the top to become favourites.
Imagine Klay Thompson but he’s built like a linebacker. That’s I hope Dort becomes

Current klay Thompson
Klay Thompson since he can’t even play now
&gt; MIP is just the “player whose PPG increased the most because of a new team/role” award  Who is MIP this year? I can probably give you a few names to make it at least a debate.  We're only 6/7 games in and I can already tell you that Kevin Durant would get the CPOTY award this year (with John Wall as an outside chance) and Klay Thompson would get it next year.  At least the Ingram vs Bam debate last year was more interesting.
klay thompson
Nobody knows what an uninjured 2020 version of Klay Thompson is so you have to go with B
Klay Thompson is a national treasure. Hope he has a full recovery.
"Eyy fellow Millennials, wanna feel old? Klay Thompson was born in 1990.  Yeah we up there now lol"
He's mad because the Bulls shut him down well last night but the Rockets' defense allows him to look Klay Thompson.
"[Charania] Klay Thompson on who’s a better scorer: Him or GSW's Stephen Curry. “I don’t compare myself with anybody,” Then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo of him putting up 37 in one quarter. “I’ll let you interpret that however you want,” Thompson said."
#Klay Thompson is the best sports player of all the times Plz give gold
"Klay Thompson, your favorite NBA players favorite player"
Klay Thompson sends his regards
After this event....  Warriors team meeting with Klay Thompson was “intense” and “at one point Steph Curry was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned.
Bogdan “klay Thompson” bogdanovic
"Believe it or not, it's Draymond that's second in win shares after Curry during the five year run, not KD.  Mostly that's because KD only played in three of the five years for us, but it still puts him ahead of who most people think of as the #2 on the Warriors - Klay Thompson."
"OP! Your username brings back memories. I know I only saw him later in his career since I'm a Stars fan, but Guy Carbonneau was one of my favorite players of that time.  Also, Klay Thompson continues to have a great sense of humor"
All ACL surgeries are reconstruction. They went in and removed his partially torn ACL. They then chose a graft from another tissue and replaced his ACL.   An example is for Klay Thompson they used his Patellar tendon as a graft. They removed a small area of it and used that to create a new ACL.
"No, he'll just get 63 in 12 minutes when he comes back. Klay Thompson is the greatest SPOT UP shooter of all time! His jumper is like porn to.me."
"I don't know why you are so hung up on Korver. Players like Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, etc. are all more valuable (and therefore ""better"" shooters than Korver).   Look at it this way, are any of these demeaning?  Magic is the greatest passer ever. MJ is the best scorer ever. Wilt is the most dominant player ever."
"&gt; I'm back with my trainer that I had my 60 point game. I'm locked in, as locked in as you can be... I'm on motherf**ker's asses this year.""  - Klay Thompson in 2022"
Klay Thompson is screaming in the Warriors locker room and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Thompson comes out say “y’all on that bullshit!” Team is imploding. Thompson is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from locker room.
ESPN: Jealous Klay Thompson threatened Steph Curry with acts of violence
"David lee was an all star.  Ik he’s not that impactful(warriors got better replacing him with dray) but all these recent discussions from mostly warriors fan focused on klay not being in his prime yet which is true yet not one person mentions the efficient 20/10 guy lol.  Now he didn’t play in the 13 playoffs so the playoff run is impressive results wise but it’s a run where Jack, Thompson, Barnes all played well so I wouldn’t characterize it as a carryjob still."

Klay thompson what are you even supposed to do he is a great roller and can also fade to the three point line
"idk bro it might just be me but losing Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and Klay Thompson sounds worse than losing Kyrie or Chris Bosh."
"Okay here are his playoff exits:  2015: Lost in conference finals to the Warriors. Dwight as his second best player  2016: No help, loses to the 72 win Warriors  2017: Loses in 6 to a 70 win Spurs team. Doesn’t play well  2018: Best player on one of the best teams ever, takes the greatest team of all time to 7 games and nearly pulls it off but CP3 gets hurt and horrendous luck with 27 missed threes  2019: chokes away the series against a KD-less Warriors maybe... but those Warriors go on to stomp the Blazers into oblivion (they do this every year btw and no one ever says Dame isn’t clutch...) and would have beaten the Raptors if not for another injury.  2020: they inexplicably blow their chance at a title by trading CP3 for one of the actual biggest playoff chokers ever  Is Curry better? Yes. Obviously. IMO he’s one of the 15 best players ever. Is Harden bad? No. He’s one of the best 5 players of the past decade who ran into the brick wall of the Warriors over and over and over.  Harden is unlucky that’s all. If CP3 doesn’t get hurt in 2018, and Klay Thompson tears his ACL two weeks earlier in 2019 then we would be looking at his career the same way we look at Kawhi. Anyway, rant over. I hate Harden slander."
"Klay Thompson top 5 nba player?  Stop it.  Curry and lebron, no question.  A D ? maybe, sure.  Klay?  Gtfoh"
"Only one. Klay Thompson can get hotter than Steph. Steph is the more consistent and better shooter, but Thompson goes thermonuclear."
Klay Thompson
"Dame also had an injured CJ and literally nobody else aside from an aging Melo.  Steph, in his prime, has had Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant, two premiere scorers in this league. Dame had to score 60 and take a high volume of shots to win games. Steph didn't. It's really that simple. Steph microwaved so many times in his prime that he could have scored 80 easily if given the opportunity to shoot at will, but that's not what was necessary.     If you told me that the next time Steph and Dame play, they're each going to take 40 shots, and I had to bet on who scores more....I'm picking Steph every time without hesitation."
Klay Thompson also deserves a shoutout for that game
"If you put prime CP3 on that 73 win team everything changes and they might not win 73 games but that could be the best defensive team of all time and would have been blowing people out and most likely have no chance of losing in the finals. DPOY, one of the best defensive centers, one of the best defensive shooting guards, one of the best defensive point guard. That team holding a team to 70 would have happened many times and would have been a much better matchup against the CAVs. Then when KD came the next year they are still very strong defensively and are still the #1 offense with CP3 passing to Klay and KD.  A lot of the reason that Steph has been decent normally in defensive stats is because he almost never guards the opponents best guard which Thompson would guard and he had some of the best interior help defenders in the league so he would be able to gamble for steals and even when he gets beat he has Dramond, Bogut, or KD in the center to make it hard at the rim."
I swear to god they are one healthy Klay Thompson away from being a contender again
"This is pure fuckin Steph. I love it. I will remember losing my sh*t at those last 3s.   Side note, I also love Klay Thompson."
Klay Thompson
"And Steph didn’t do this on a historically good team. Steph didn’t do this with KD taking the defensive attention away. Steph didn’t even do this with the elite threat of Klay Thompson at the arc  Steph scored 62 points surrounded by the worst jump shooter in the league, the worst contract in the league, old man Draymond, and a rookie big man"
"Lavine was used off-ball a lot at Minnesota, in fact its probably his best role being a more explosive Klay Thompson. Either curling off screens for a 3pt shot or attacking close-outs  His ability to stop on a dime and elevate for a jumper is fantastic, the Bulls just don't quite have the personnel to use him that way so he's basically spent his entire time in Chicago as the lead ball-handler since everyone else is rubbish."
"KD would have been who he was as a player with or without Scott Brooks, it was plenty obvious from his college days.  Harden was the same, he was just never the main man at OKC. The fact he went to Houston and immediately turned into an All-NBA player is testament to it. His per 100 possessions numbers at OKC are fairly in line with what a fringe all-star should be producing (25/7/5), in fact its pretty close to what Klay Thompson is doing for his career (29/5/3 per 100 poss)"
"Hang on, we need somebody to chime in about how stacked those teams were, while pretending that 2013-2014 Klay wasn't affectionately known as ""Klank Thompson"" and Draymond wasn't playing like 20 mpg off the bench"
"It was 100% when the Raptors won the Finals. Nobody expected them to get that far, and no one thought GSW would have Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant Injured (again)."
2021 Klay Thompson...
Tony Wroten was a GOD in 2k. Tony Wroten in my mind is a combination of Gary Payton and Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson incoming**
"""Multiple advanced stats"" = box score based formulas.  BPM, VORP, RAPTOR, RPM, WS, PIPM etc are all box score based stats with different formulas. Some are rate based, some also incorporate plus/minus, and some place more value in certain stats over others but they generally look at similar things. If a player is good with one they are likely good with another and people think ""oh they are good with all of them so they must likely be good"" They mostly overrate the same type of player whether they suck up all the uncontested rebounds or high a USG% and they underrate the same type of player who doesn't get a bunch of scores that show up in the box score. This is especially the case for defense. For example Russel Westbrook, Luka Doncic, and Hasan Whitesite get overrated by most of them them and it underrates people like Dennis Rodman, and Klay Thompson. Seriously look up Dennis Rodmans defensive player of the year ""advanced stats"" years for defense.  I like simpler advanced stats like TS%, plus minus etc but to look at them in context. For example ""oh this player has really high TS, but he is a center that just dunks and doesn't have high volume"" or ""this guy has high amount of rebounds but they are mostly uncontested and he barely improves his teams rebounding when he is on the court vs off""."
Klay Thompson. Your defense + shooting would be insane.
"Yeah, cause Demarcus Cousins and Klay Thompson have such similar body types, game, and fitness, right?  How's John Wall looking?"
"&gt;The vast majority of the shots were going to Curry, Klay, and KD.   In 2015, for example, the Warriors attempted 27 threes per game, and Curry and Thompson accounted for 15.2 of them.  The remainder were shot by Barnes, Igoudala, Green, Holiday, Barbosa, and a couple others.  That's 56% by Curry and Thompson, which is not ""the vast majority"".  In 2016, it was 31.6 for the team, and 19.3 for Thompson and Curry.  That's 61%.  Even in 2019, Durant, Thompson, and Curry combined for 24.4 of 34.4 threes -- so the ""other guys"" where still launching 10 per game, or 30% of them.  You should watch your own team a little more carefully."
What the fuck did they expect?  We also knew that from the moment they signed him  He also isn't Klay Thompson. We knew that too.
Fuck Klay Thompson
"Such a massive over reaction to a slump. He played really well for us all last year, took on additional minutes when we had injuries, shot the ball well, and hustled his ass off. He’s never going to be Klay Thompson, but he’s still a good player, and will bounce back."
"Wiggins' passing has been just fine imo. Oubre has been a black hole that forces the issue, but Wiggins can move the ball. APG isn't a great way to measure passing tendencies, especially over a 5 game sample (and when you cut the previous 50 games because it shows the opposite of what you're saying).   Oubre has been a black hole, and his tunnel vision is problematic. But he doesn't need to be a playmaker that racks up assists. Klay Thompson averages around 2-2.5 APG. It's not a problem to have only 2 playmakers and 2-3 play finishers in a lineup if the finishers are actually finishing. Oubre won't shoot this terribly forever, and a 5 game sample is not enough to write him off entirely.   Fans, and players, need to have patience. Everyone said it would be a rough start. The team shooting will get better, and the chemistry will get better. We need to see 20-30 games before reasonable judgments about players and fit can be made."
Wrong dude to cover for Klay Thompson.
"Yeah, but it's usually the sons of players that were journeymen or roleplayers that seem to thrive and not the sons of stars. They can reach the league and have the blueprint for getting there, but I can't think of any that followed up their fathers with similar greatness. Like I can't think of any father/son duos where both were similarly great if the father was All-Star caliber.   You see it with the 2nd gen stepping up if their dads were in the league but not stars (Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, Klay Thompson, etc.) but if their dads were stars, they're usually roleplayers (Barry brothers, Luke Walton, David Stockton, Gary Payton II, etc.).   I feel like it comes down to having something to prove per individual. And to be honest, based off people I've met all through my life, it's usually the people who are already well off that don't have much to prove. Not saying Bronny can't be great, but I wouldn't put any money on it."
They had a nice run. But their run was predicated on luck. Hard not to say that. They literally won their first championship because the Cavs were short handed. It took Klay Thompson going bananas for them to get past OKC in 2016. Then they added the second best player in the whole league because they had space because of Curry’s contract. Also took the Rockets missing 27 straight 3’s to get past that in 2018. They had the good health for awhile while other teams were hurt around them.
"&gt; But the rebuild is gonna take longer than Steph has to wait.   There is no reason to trade Steph, or Klay, or Draymond.  None.  You rebuild with them on your team.  Why?  Look at the phoenix suns.  How did they go from a good, young nucleus of talent to translating that into wins?  There are other teams, like the Timberwolves, the Bulls, the Pelicans, and etc. that have good, young nucleuses that have not been able to translate that talent into wins and losses.  Why?    The biggest difference I see on the Suns is Chris Paul.  The Suns were a good story in the bubble, but they are a good team right now.  Bringing in Chris Paul, a guy who knows what to do and where to be to win close games, and who has played in and won many close games in his career, is having a big effect on the suns.    Young players need mentors, and not from coaches all the time.  Locker room leadership is a real thing.  The wolves have tons of talent, and they can't win.  Why?  The Bulls do, why?  There's no adult in the locker room.  The Bulls starting lineup is younger than the University of Wisconsin's starting lineup.  That doesn't work.    These young players keep going down this path, they will pick up bad habits that they will not be able to break out of even later in their careers.  At a point, a player's career hardens, and you are what you are.  For most normal people, that switch happens at age 24 (according to behavioral psychology).  It is absolutely crucial that you get good mentorship before the age of 24, or you're sunk.    Now, look at the Spurs.  They never had a plethora of top 10 draft picks.  After Duncan, Genobili and Parker, they had one top prospect for a period of about 20 years: Kawhi Leonard.  One top prospect was enough.  Why?  Because Kawhi had the fortune of starting his career in a place with absolutely the strongest locker room ever, he was surrounded by guys with championship rings.  He was a young rookie who learned to do it the right way.  The reason why the Spurs must rebuild now is because they've lost that locker room.    Having that veteran locker room, of players who have won rings in the past, can massively increase the probability that your draft picks pan out and become stars.    The best argument for NOT trading Curry, Thompson or Green is James Wiseman.  Do you want to give him the BEST chance to harness all of that freakish natural talent he has into becoming a generational talent?    Let him learn the RIGHT habits when he's 19 years old, from Steph, Klay, Draymond, and Kevon Looney.  Let him learn from 4 other players in the same locker room who have 11 championship rings between them.    You want to maximize the chances that those two top 20 overall selections in a loaded draft the warriors will have in the summer of 2021 pan out into terrific, foundational players?  Give them the right MENTORS early in their careers.    Most of us, in this life, never had a mentor when we were young, so our lives become a series of distractions and we spend much of our existence running in place, always trying hard, without ever getting anywhere.  That's due to our habits.  Young players learn by mimicking the habits of their older peers.  If you have a locker room full of young players who care about their social media standing and their brand, guess what those young players will pick up on?  If you have one dedicated to being unselfish and to winning, guess how those young players will grow up?    If the objective is to get the warriors back to contention as quickly as possible, trading Steph, Klay, and Draymond is about the worst thing you could do.    Meyers did the right thing in 2019, he kept the four foundational locker room players, and swapped out everyone else."
"OP is not paying attention.  What do you think Meyers did in the summer of 2019?  He blew it up.  They are in the process of rebuilding right now, that's why the team doesn't look that great, they're rebuilding.    Look at the summer of 2019 again, carefully.  Look at the all the players who were on the roster for the 2019 finals.  Do you know how many of them suited up for GS a few months later for the start of the 2019-20 season?    Four.  Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Kevon Looney.  That was the carry-over.  Meyers BLEW IT UP in the summer of 2019.  What OP is calling for, Meyers ALREADY DID."
"I think it’s definitely real. Put draymond green or Klay Thompson on a bad team they won’t win a lot more games than they did before, but they can be the pieces that pushes a team to championship caliber. Put Westbrook on a bad team you expect them to have a shot at the playoffs, but you also don’t think Russ is the piece a team needs to win the championship"
Honestly give dame prime klay and thompson and he could do damage.
"They've got plenty to choose from. The elephant in the room is the Wiggins contract, but Draymond Green is also well compensated, and even though I imagine the Warriors front office will show loyalty to their guys, Klay Thompson also makes loads of money. Oubre is an expiring $14 million contract so he's the easiest to move."
"You had the nerve to criticize David Lee, his all star teammate in on of those season, as the worst defender on a team led by Steph Curry, whom the Warriors go out of their way to hide him on defense by giving him elite defenders like Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodola and Draymond Green. Let's not forget back then they were 10 deep off the bench. You're delusional in your recount of things."
"oh so stephews finally realize that every superstar in the league has ""muh gravity™"" but not everyone has KD &amp; Klay Thompson bailing them out, welcome to the real world"
"They lost Klay Thompson, KD and Javale all at once. Stephs all alone. These Warriors will struggle for a bit but give Kerr a chance. He won’t figure it out all at once. Theres a reason why he coaches superstars and we type comments."
"No, but a healthy Klay Thompson, 2 lottery picks, and a second-year Wiseman might not be the worst thing in the world."
"While I agree in terms of contention, I believe Klay Thompson would be the difference between playoffs and not."
"Klay Thompson returning offers excellent defense and spacing to the floor, in addition to around 20 points a night, with the likely chance of a nuclear performance. A Klay thompson is easily the difference between playoffs and not, and potentially contention.   Now, a 32 year old Klay coming off of his injury is hard to say. We don't know how he will play. We don't know how Steph will play. It's very hard to quantify."
Bron AD (healthy) Klay Thompson?
Klay Thompson isn’t remotely close to the second option that other all-time greats have had.
Not to be mean but so did klay thompson. Injuries can happen at any time
Not quite Klay Thompson but he shows promise
How can Klay Thompson be better than CJ McCollum when he had three players on the team better than himself?
"but i thought ""muh gravity™"" would turn Wiggins &amp; Oubre into prime Kevin Durant &amp; Klay Thompson"
Not even Klay Thompson would save this squad that much. Helps the offense but the main guys are just much older now. And the bench still is lackluster compared to before
Tbh Klay Thompson better than all of them at dribbling
Heurter is like klay thompson except he can do some play making in addition to being a good shooter. This Hawks team is like the fucking warriors again.
Why does Olynyk always play like he thinks he's Klay Thompson? Man puts up so many trash 3s and literally never seems to make them lol
And people keep acting like Kobe had Klay Thompson to kick out to instead of Jordan Farmar. The 3 consecutive finals and two championships is certainly solid evidence of Kobe being an inefficient chucker and toxic leader.
"in all honesty, i think the worst thing about the klay injury is that he is now lost for the year. he's a great cutter, and is athletic, but clearly his game isnt predicated on crossovers or quickness. the basketball fan in me wants to believe that a year off, plus conditioning, rehab, and whatever *ahem regimens* that top players use, will almost certainly return thompson to basically 100% of his former self  it's like if somebody gave jj redick two more inches and wide open hips and an extra 7% long-range accuracy. shit, with any luck, GSW gets another solid lottery pick and in 2022 are sudden title contenders again  yo the casual fan would be either elated or incensed hahahaha"
"KD is useless in the playoffs without 2 time MVP steph curry right next to him, along with all stars klay thompson and draymond green."
"This. Reckless fouls in air from behind, when the fouled player is on the way to the rim have caused multiple serious or career altering injuries:  Andrew Bogut by Amare Stodemire: broken ankle  Brandon Rush by Zach Randolph: torn ACL  Klay Thompson by Danny Green: torn ACL  Patrick McCaw by Vince Carter: back injury  They should really be auto flagrants just as fouls to the head are, and especially when clear path fouls from behind already get two and the ball."
"And what is the difference between Siakam and Kyrie, PG, Scottie Pippen, Klay Thompson, and Steph? All of them are a lock for the hall of fame except PG. Siakam isn't even on the same planet as them. And here's the perfect role player comparison for Siakam, Chris Bosh when he was a member of the Miami Heat. Saying Siakam would be a role player on a championship team is not a diss.   &gt; I’m not the GM, I don’t have the answer of how they’d add one. But a few months before the Kawhi trade I wouldn’t have had the answer either and that ended up happening. Luckily there’s someone very good in charge of the whole thing that I fully trust to pull it off. Since, you know, he already has before.  I know you're not the GM, but I wanted to hear potential ways that they could and by you deflecting on that question tells me what I need to know. The Toronto Raptors assets are totally different since the Kawhi trade so trying to compare the situation is a moot point. And at the end of the season you all are going to either have to overpay to keep Lowry or he's going to walk out the door for nothing like Ibaka did. Same with Powell."
I mean Klay Thompson tore his ACL on a clean play by Danny Green. You just cannot make rules to eliminate all risk of injury. It’s inherently part of the game.
"Yo, Klay Thompson deserves every penny, we can't predict injuries."
"There's still Westbrook, Wall, Klay Thompson, D-Lo, Wiggins, and Horford out there.  Sixers were going to be capped out at the end of that summer anyways, so giving Harris that contract didn't matter. Yeah, they messed up not keeping Butler, but they could have kept both Butler and Harris had Philly had competent management in Morey in charge at the time."
Klay Thompson in the 2019 WCF.
"OP is speaking about the rest of the team. if we are looking at Steph from a lenses of always having all time greats, unless you believe David lee is an all time great, he only had one other all star. And Steph in 2013 is what made me and others pay attention to him. Curry really did his thing in that post season and the best player behind him in both of those series was Harrison Barnes, Jarrett jack and pre star Klay Thompson"
Klay Thompson in the 2015 Finals
Klay Thompson always has been Midorima.
Klay Thompson the entire 2017 playoffs
Klay Thompson wasn’t an All Star this year
"I mean OP is just trying to start shit (which I think is fine and fun) but if you wanted to entertain the question seriously, we have no idea how many rings and MVPs Lillard could have won if his second best player was Klay Thompson instead of CJ (there's two sides of the court, sorry). And that's without mentioning KD  Edit: Or Draymond, who's a weird player but obviously enabled them to play a uniquely deadly style"
Nope. But some luck (Klay coming back near his former self) and leveraging of their future (Wiseman + Wolves FRP + FRPs) for a third star could put them back into contention. Alot hinges on what Thompson looks like when he gets back.
"1. Jokic, 2. Jimmy Butler, 3. Klay Thompson"
"He’s still a HOFer to the NFLs standards. If Lynn fucking Swann is a HOFer, Klay Thompson would’ve DEFINITELY be in."
Klay Thompson isn't going to be flying around screens putting up 30 in a quarter after the leg injuries he has had.
klay thompson post ACL isnt making a 9 seed a contender
"Uh, first of all, there were plenty of possessions where the Cavs *didn't* hunt Curry for an ISO mismatch. There were plenty of times when they hunted other players or didn't go ISO hunting at all.  Second of all, yeah, of course they went for the clearest mismatch more often than not. That's just kind of a 'no shit' thing. Yes, Curry was a worse defender on LeBron than Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, or Andre Iguodala. Not really much shame in that."
"The team completely imploded, so he ended up looking really bad by association. It would be like if the Trailblazers or a team of that caliber struggled to make the playoffs this season but Lillard still put up great stats.  He was also replaced by Klay Thompson because Klay was the second best scorer on the best regular season team ever, and it seemed weird for him to not make all-NBA."
"Kyle Korver, Klay Thompson?"
I think ill have to go with klay thompson
"That's probably a little harsh.  I think they watch sometimes and mostly watch the ball, where Klay rarely visits.  Then they hear that Klay is supposed to be a huge contributor but they watch Steph be a magician with the ol' leather pumpkin and don't realize how much space Thompson opens up for Curry and how he weaponizes replaceable bigs like Zaza, Ezeli, Looney and the like like with his constant sprinting around screens.  They hear he's a good defender but he excels through his positioning and attention to detail as he is not a particularly disruptive force.    He's a bit more subtle than your average star on both sides of the ball but he is (was, at least) absolutely a star."
"I promise you, people on this sub don’t watch this sport. They really don’t. I’m almost sure half of this sub has never seen Klay Thompson play."
"May i interest you in a few videos of klay thompson, the person holding the record for most points in QUARTER (37 points)?"
Klay Thompson got reinjured at practice too
Is there a generational NBA rivalry that followed generations? Like a Mychal Thompson v Harvey Grant beef that turned into Klay v Jermai?
"Ben Simmons.  Of non Sixers though, Klay Thompson and Damian Lillard"
"1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry   5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetounkounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Damian Lillard   9. Luka Doncic   10. Joel Embiid   11. Jimmy Butler   12. Jayson Tatum   13. Bradley Beal   14. KAT   15. Bam Adebayo  16. Kyrie Irving   17. Paul George   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Anthony Davis   20. Chris Paul   21. Klay Thompson   22. Jaylen Brown   23. Devin Booker   24. Trae Young   25. Zach Lavine  Named 25 players I’d rather have, just for you champ. There’s more too."
It was a tie game with 5 min left and the game completely turned after Draymond had a flagrant foul on Kawhi . Batum and Beverly also turned into Klay Thompson at that point
"PG: Stephen Curry  / Chris Paul / Luka Doncic  SG: Klay Thompson  /  James Harden  / Damian Lillard  SF: Lebron James  /  Paul George  /  Jimmy Butler  PF: Kevin Durant  /  Draymond Green /  Derrick Jones Jr.   C: Anthony Davis  /  Nikola Jokic /  Joel Embiid  There's nobody else I'd want catching garbage time lobs besides Derrick Jones Jr. He's my 15th man, I can't imagine being convinced otherwise. His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
I mean for Klay it would be different. There is a good chance he had met kobe a lot and knew him for a long time even as a kid. You have to remember Mychal Thompson is the lakers colour commentator so there is a good chance Klay knew and met kobe. Klay probably knew kobe pretty well for those title runs with pau as well.
"Since Klay Thompson last played, I started a new job, we entered a pandemic ,I left the said job and started another new job. It's not even 2 years but feels sooooooooooo long ago."
"Very true, but I also distinctly remember the warriors offense being very middling compared to their talent. In particular, I remember Zach Lowe complaining about Klay Thompson and Harrison Barnes postups with Mark Jackson"
Klay Thompson
"His shooting splits can only be described as atrocious, he’s 7 feet tall and 200 pounds, and he shoots with the confidence of JR Smith or Klay Thompson. Not surprising to see why he’s a meme"
"[\[Letourneau\] Klay Thompson: ""I genuinely love the game so much that it's been kind of hard to find happiness without it.""](https://twitter.com/Con_Chron/status/1371184039478972418)  :( :( :("
It's like they're also missing Klay Thompson.
"you're right man my fault. guess joe harris &gt; klay thompson and deandre jordan &gt; draymond green eh? don't forget about hall of famer nick claxton and bruce brown. not even the 96 bulls could beat them! don't forget KD's telepathic powers, being able to contribute to this hot streak right now while even on the bench in a hoodie!"
"What does shooting have to do with dribbling up the court?  Joe Harris and Klay Thompson don't get doubled dribbling up the court either. James Harden does though, and more often than Dame does. Does that mean Harden is a better shooter than everyone else?"
Klay thompson
He’s basically Klay Thompson
"Ok I see but that's more a semantic issue. To me Klay Thompson is also a role player for instance. Middleton also is a role player to me. I think Oladipo had one year where he wasn't a role player. Sabonis can be seen as a Star player though so calling him a role player was maybe harsh, but then again he'd be a role player on a treu championship contender so he's somewhere inbetween for me. Which would kinda qualify as a good/elite role player. FTR I think these gguys are good NBA players, just not center pieces you'd want to be your first option on a contending team."
"he was the youngest player in the Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson draft"
"Being better at creating your own shot isn’t really relevant when your production is similar. Nobody would think Tobias is a better scorer than Klay Thompson or Anthony Davis for example. Production matters more than “how does he get his points”  He‘s almost certainly not a better defender, so that really just leaves rebounding"
"I’m so glad Embiid is ok. Watching him come down on that knee gave me horrible Klay Thompson flashbacks. Be careful out there big guy, the last thing anyone needs is a career-threatening injury."
"Carrying means taking a mediocre team deep into the playoffs (e.g. '18 Cavs) or a terrible team to the playoffs (e.g. '06 Kobe).  Steph has never carried a team. If '13 Curry ""carried"" a team on 22/4/6 with all-star David Lee and Klay Thompson shooting 40% from three, then carrying means nothing."
The only person I think had a chance is his teammate Klay Thompson but after being out for 2 years I don’t think he can catch up.
Klay Thompson walked off on his own power as well.
Final game of 2011/12 Warriors season vs Spurs. We were tanking to get the pick that would be Harrison Barnes.  PG- Charles Jenkins  SG- (rookie) Klay Thompson  SF- Chris Wright  PF- Mickell Gladness  C- Jeremy Tyler
"Oh yes I forgot, amount of shooters is what = spacing. Not the quality of shooters.   A Steph, Klay, iguodala, Lebron, Draymond lineup has better spacing than Kyrie, JR, Lebron, Love, Thompson lineup"
Streaky was probably the wrong word. I meant can Kyrie get the hottest out of this group? Like Klay Thompson if his shot is falling it just seems to keep going in
"Exactly! I was so excited for last season with all the duos contending teams but it got all fucked up with Covid, and then this season was looking to be even better but with Klay Thompson getting injured and the Harden trade, and AD missing time things might not be as good as I hoped"
"His catch and shoot jumper has some klay thompson to it. obviously at his height, he's going to get porzingis comps, but i see some klay. he had 3 tools coming into the league. he has mobility with size, he has a pure stroke, and he has great vision. if he can fix his glaring weaknesses (as an 18 year old), he can be something."
"This is the difference between a team mentality and a franchise mentality. The team mentality says go out and win as many games as you can always, the franchise mentality says this isn’t about the 2020-21 season, or the next couple for that matter, its about the long-term health of the franchise.   The Inside guys seem to think the warriors have one more run in them, I don’t see it that way. With or without Klay Thompson, none of those guys who were part of the 2015-2019 teams are the same. They have two choices here  1. Mortgage the future of the franchise (Wiseman, T-Wolves pick, Wiggins) to try to bring in a player to help them win now against the likes of the Lakers, Nets, Sixers, and Bucks  2. Trade Steph and Klay for talented young players and picks, building the team around James Wiseman and possibly a Cade Cunningham or Jalen Green with an eye toward returning to the top of the top of the mountain in 3 years or so when the Nets and Lakers are no longer as dominant"
klay thompson  hasn't played in months and the only reason he's still on the roster is because he's related to steph
When u go from KD and Klay Thompson to Wiggins and Oubre Jr
Homeless man’s Klay Thompson. Al I’ve ever wanted was for him to play for the warriors
"By your precedent, every team outside the top 4 should tank then.   Lol they may not be contenders as of right now but they’re a couple missing pieces away, one being a healthy Klay Thompson."
"James Harden needs the ball nearly constantly. Klay Thompson is a far better complementary player.   Thus, Klay Thompson &gt; James Harden."
Is it like that guy who was the Klay Thompson look-alike? Lol
Hart also has more three pointers than Klay Thompson this season.   That stat is as useful as the OP's.
"Off the top of my head, I would say probably around 100.     Melo is a tough guy to rate.  If you are looking a numbers (without getting too hung up on efficiency) you might make him top 50.     But, I could probably list 200 guys I'd rather have on my team if I wanted to win a championship.     I think part of the problem with Melo was that he wasn't good enough to be the #1 guy on a championship team, but his game was not suited to be a #2 guy.      A great #2 guy is usually either a playmaker, a great defender or a guy who thrives on open shots created by his great #1.    Klay Thompson is a classic #2 guy.  But, Melo was a bad defender, a mediocre passer and really  wasn't much better on wide open looks than he was on his hero ball shots."
"&gt;Curry had 3 all stars on his team in Draymond, Klay and Iggy  It doesn't work like that. You don't say someone had all star teammates if they weren't selected as an all star that season.   For the 2015 championship season Stephen Curry played with exactly **one** All Star, Klay Thompson. Draymond Green had not any All Star selections yet and Andre Iguodala has had exactly **one** All Star selection in his career and it was 2012, three seasons before this run.  Stephen Curry was 100% the most important part of the Warriors from the start of the run until today. He was more important than KD, than Draymond, than Iguodala.   The only reason Curry was robbed of the FMVP was they voters did some kind of weird ""can't give it to a player on the losing team so we'll give it to the guy who guarded him,"" as LeBron's usage was very high and so were his counting stats. It is widely regarded as a flubbed vote.   If you go by the numbers, eye test, accomplishments, anyway you slice it Stephen Curry is one the best active players and will go down as one of the best to ever play.   The fact that LeBron stans and Harden stans hate him so much and always try to tear him down ironically reveals just how impactful he is.   So keep talking shit about Curry and telling us all how much you fear and resent him."
Klay Thompson is overrated. Even Ben Simmons made more threes than him this year.
I think the real story everyone is missing. Ben Simmons has hit more 3s than Klay Thompson this year.
I've actually made the same number of threes as Klay Thompson. Max me GSW.
Next post: Lonzo Ball had made more threes than Klay Thompson this season
"For you and u/808s_and_Heartbeats  http://www.celebritydetective.com/Klay-Thompson-Mailing-Address.html  No idea if this is real, but that's all I could find."
the Kevin Huerter/Klay Thompson comparisons were always baffling
"I know we needed a center but we’re looking for a second score behind curry till klay comes back. We could’ve had curry ball and Thompson, can you imagine that"
Klay Thompson &amp; Timberwolves 2021 4th pick who will turn out to be Jonathan Kuminga
"The Lakers turned the results of their tank into a player that helped deliver a championship.  The Warriors weren't purposely tanking but they were garbage for a long time and used their high picks to build a core of Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green.  It certainly can work, it just requires a good front office. Something most teams in the top 10 don't have."
"Come so far from his days of IG mishaps, almost makes me shed a tear.  Also looking forward to our future color commentator Klay Thompson."
Klay Thompson. Also some consistent bench players would help
"The dude simply does not have off-nights. He's shot below 30% from 3 only 3 times this whole year. For reference, Klay Thompson shot worse than 30% 27 times in in his most recent season (2019). I don't know where this ranks among the best shooting seasons of all time but it could very well be the single most consistent 3 point shooting year ever. I'm legitimately shocked whenever a shot of his misses"
Right so explain to me how having klay Thompson back would move the needle but having beal who is a better player then Thompson not move the needle. Yall realize Beal is scoring 30 ppg right?
They just need another shooter out there to punish teams for loading up on Curry. Park Klay on the weak side and all of a sudden if you trap it's a quick pass to Draymond and it's a lot different helping off of Kelly Oubre or Andrew Wiggins and helping off of Klay Thompson.   I just hope Klay comes back like his old self.
Moved from one former mvp in curry to another fromer mvp in Harden and having the luxury of having third options of the like of klay Thompson and Kyrie Irving which one could be the best shooter in the league and the other best one on one player in the league
"the hell does that mean though?  if you change all the attributes of this player, THEN it's this player?  The need to stretch this much just to drag trae is sad and absurd.    My first thought would have been somebody like Duncan Robinson or Troy Daniels, good shooters who can only shoot, and are very suspect defensively.    Cuz if we're allowed to stretch things completely, then, why not Harden, but without the playmaking?  Or curry without the playmaking?  Or Klay Thompson without the defense?"
"I’m not trying to hate on Randle, and I think he’s closer to too 30, but since I already did 19 players I’ll keep going:  Curry, KD, LeBron, Harden, Giannis, Dame, AD, Kawhi, George, Embiid, Jokic, Butler, Simmons, Gobert, Booker, Paul, Kyrie, Beal, Vucevic, KAT, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zion, Zach Lavine, Trae Young, SGA, Luka,  Bam Adebayo  That’s 28, there’s probably some players that are slipping my mind right now. But that puts him right around top 30, like I said. Idk about 36th though, unless we start counting guys that are out like Klay Thompson, Nurkic, CJ, etc."
"“You put Jrue in any system, any coach is going to ask him to guard the best player. We played them in 2018, second round and he guarded me the whole series. He was picking me up full court, he was guarding me in the post. Actually, it was tough to dribble on Jrue Holiday. He slides his feet so well, he’s got good hands, he’s strong, he’s got good instincts. I gained a lot of respect for him in that series because he went from guarding me to Klay (Thompson) to Steph (Curry) to guarding Draymond (Green), neutralizing picks and rolls. He’s special. He’s special on that side of the ball. Jrue Holiday is solidified as probably the best defender in the league at the guard position. “ - Kevin Durant"
"Nah, it’s not a sound argument. The mid-2000s Pistons are famously a team without a “star”. Wallace was the only one to make the All-star team in 2004. Penalizing Dray for being on the same team as Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Steph Curry is dumb. Being the third or fourth best player on a championship team with two recent league MVPs shouldn’t be a knock."
 better shooter than klay thompson 🌚
So no Klay Thompson then?
Scoring can be a role too though. I feel like klay thompson is the best role player in the league because he doesn’t do much outside of what he’s best at but he’s the best in the league at what he’s best at
Klay Thompson needs to get better. Let's hope he's back and ready to play next year.
"Team with Steph Curry and Klay Thompson while Shaq demands paint coverage ""has no shooting""."
"I think you're looking at it from the wrong angle. that's all those guys should be doing. their role was defined by their skillsets being limited. if you've ever seen Danuel House try and move around the court or dribble a basketball, you'll know why he shouldn't be doing much more than standing on the 3pt line. same goes for PJ Tucker, and even Eric Gordon.  &amp;#x200B;  they didn't have any intelligent playmakers on the team. they were consistently signing minimum guys and pulling up from the G League (House, Mclemore) or finding guys that nobody else wanted (Rivers, Green, even Gordon) to avoid paying the tax.  &amp;#x200B;  [The Missing Piece the Rockets Need to Help James Harden - The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/5/11/18616097/houston-rockets-missing-piece-james-harden)  &gt;The Rockets’ problem, especially in comparison to the  Warriors, is that they have never had players who combine both. They  have no one comparable to Andre Iguodala or Klay Thompson, much less  Draymond or Durant. None of their other shot creators are natural  pick-and-roll partners for a star guard. Golden State can switch a  screen between Harden and Gordon, Paul, or Rivers, and keep  similar-sized defenders on both players. They don’t have to worry about  any of those three attacking Harden’s defender on a switch. He is always  the one who has to create the mismatch, which wears him down during a  series. My guess is the primary cause of Harden’s history of fading in  the playoffs is his overwhelming offensive responsibility, not any flaw  in his character or his game.   &gt;   &gt;Harden doesn’t play with anyone who makes his life easier in the way Draymond and Durant do for Steph Curry. [The play that sealed Game 6 for Golden State](https://twitter.com/connectwidutpal/status/1127056521232175105)  (a Thompson 3 with 36 seconds left in the fourth quarter) summed up the  difference between the two teams. Houston blitzed a pick-and-roll  between Steph and Draymond, creating a four-on-three opportunity for  Draymond at the 3-point line. He drove into the lane and found Iguodala  in the corner, who then swung the ball to Thompson. There is no one on  the Rockets’ roster who can consistently make the play that Green did.  Draymond is a legitimate point forward. Neither Capela nor Tucker is  comfortable making plays off the dribble. The Warriors can overload to  stop Harden without worrying about any of his frontcourt players making  them pay for it.  this is a really good article that highlights the difference between the Rockets and, say, the Warriors. it's not like Harden wouldn't of rather had other lineups, it's that for what the Rockets were willing to spend they were never going to get guys who were more capable of doing anything other than 3&amp;D."
I’m pretty sure Harris’s name gets brought up a lot more than anyone you mentioned tbh. Just yesterday someone asked if he was a better shooter than Klay Thompson.
Klay Thompson is a star player and a great role player at the same time
Klay Thompson isn't a role player.
Klay Thompson when healthy
Like Klay Thompson?  Remember the box and one only came out in the Raptors final after Klay and KD were down.
"This just, especially, just screams ""I have not watched this series""  &gt; Wade in 2006, in a much slower paced game than 2016 shot 97 free-throws in SIX games. Lebron James, Steph Curry, and Klay Thompson COMBINED shot less in SEVEN games in the 2016 finals.  Like have you seen Wade play? Wade is a slasher, he caved in the interior defense of the Mavs. They literally couldn't keep up. They just fed Wade on drives, over and over and over again. Steph and Klay don't play like this. Lebron is notably given the Shaq treatment, cause unlike Wade, his body doesn't move.  Like the example you give, Dirk reaches in and whacks the shit out of his upper body, causing Wade to go off balance. That is one of the least bad calls and every time, it's brought up like it's one of the bad ones. The entire series is that play right there, Wade driving, Mavs player who can't defend wade, fouls him.  Tim also said he never rigged playoff games (lol). He's not a trust worthy perspective."
"This same response over and over again. Calling fouls is one thing, calling fouls EVERY single time there is contact is another thing.  You think guys like Lebron aren't fouled every other possession? It's just that refs don't call soft contact, especially in the playoffs, especially in the finals, especially that often. This is an egregious [call.](https://youtu.be/X2zonUdXJkQ?t=362)  Wade in 2006, in a much slower paced game than 2016 shot 97 free-throws in SIX games. Lebron James, Steph Curry, and Klay Thompson COMBINED shot less in SEVEN games in the 2016 finals.  Additionally, Donaghy has come out and [said](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2744705-disgraced-former-ref-tim-donaghy-says-mavericks-were-screwed-out-of-2006-title) that the 2006 finals were rigged in the favor of the Heat."
We were gonna redeem ourselves from 2016 and come back down 3-1   Klay Thompson FMVP Steph never gonna get one ^(/s)
Klay Thompson is my pick.
No you’re getting downvoted because the Warriors aren’t going to trade Klay Thompson lol
"He's on the team because he's been on the team in the past and is a vet who's familiar with the process. Probably was willing to have a role where he wasn't going to play much.   Who was the token white guy in 2016, klay Thompson? 🤣🤣"
"Fucking Reggie Jackson, when did he become Klay Thompson"
Reggie Jackson might as well be Klay Thompson on offense out there man
I've always been curious to hear r/gonewild's opinion on whether Joe Harris is better than Klay Thompson
"No, and I don't think Scottie is wrong really, he makes some good points, with the exception of the Harden bit, which was dumb.   &gt; It’s not an individual game, you can’t go into basketball and beat nobody with an individual record. And I used this example of what happened to Kevin Durant just the other day: this is the first time we’ve ever really seen Kevin Durant have to be the man and bring the team home. We ain’t never really had to see that because he’s had [Russell] Westbrook, Steph Curry, Klay [Thompson]. He’s been beating people, definitely in Golden State, by committee. With a team. He did that, but that team already knew how to win without KD. But you put KD in Brooklyn, and Kyrie [Irving] gets hurt and James Harden ain’t that guy, now KD not only has to score for them but also make plays for them. And this is no knock to KD, but they asked me, “Has he surpassed LeBron James?” And my answer was: LeBron James knows team basketball better than KD.  Other than his stupid commentary re Harden that ignores that he was injured, the rest of this is pretty fair.   &gt; KD can score better than LeBron, probably always have been able to. But has he surpassed LeBron? Naw. He tried to beat the Milwaukee Bucks instead of utilizing his team. You see what I’m saying? LeBron James would’ve figured out how to beat them and he wouldn’t have been exhausted and he may not have taken the last shot. But LeBron ain’t KD, and KD ain’t LeBron. KD is a shooter, a scorer. But he doesn’t have what LeBron has.  I feel like this is a good summary of the LeBron vs. KD debate and why LeBron is better. KD would win in a game of 1v1 100 times out of 100 vs. LeBron, but that's not what this game is about, it's about who is the best 5v5 team basketball player and LeBron is better at making his teammates better. KD doesn't really do anything to make his teammates better, he's the ultimate individual player."
"This is why I like the new lottery odds. Teams like OKC this year blatantly tanking and holding out their best players for lotto ball odds shouldn’t be consistently rewarded with top 3-5 picks. Honestly while I think Presti is a fantastic executive, the Thunder’s situation rn reminds me of the Celtics from 2018-now. Mid first round picks in the NBA are such a crapshoot that they really aren’t as valuable as a lot of people believe. For every Donovan Mitchell or Devin Booker or Klay Thompson there’s 100 Jimmer Fredettes and Jerome Robinsons."
Easy to win with no Durant nor Klay Thompson
"Yeah it’s tough, 3&amp;D guys rarely make it, and it would have to be like in the Klay Thompson mold. But even then 3&amp;D feels like it’s reducing how good Klay really is"
"Idk I’d Love could ever create his own shot. He was wet and scored in the post in Minnesota. Does that count as creating your own shot?  The only other player that comes to mind is Klay Thompson. I know that’s subjective, but the dude never really dribbled much from what I remember. If catch and shoot, pump fake, and then drive counts as creating your own shot, then John should count as being able to create his own shot too imo"
"Wouldn't call his lack of all-NBA appearances due to being in a small market or because Jordan took the spot. Mitch Richmond had all 5 of his in Sacramento, playing the same position as Miller and Reggie was one of the most recognizable stars of that era due to how clutch he was. It's not a knock on Reggie to say he's an all-star but not a perennial all-NBA level star. Klay Thompson is a hall of fame lock too and he's only been on 2 all NBA teams (so far)."
"Lets build a new NBA Team roster who smoke weed only and call it  ""The Cannabeasts""  Caruso - PG  Klay Thompson - SG  JR smith - SF  Joakim Noah - C  Micheal Beasley - PF"
"&gt; Remember when Raptors fans clapped when Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson got injured?  Some idiots did cheer for KD going down, but Klay went down at home.  Also what does this have to do with your post at all?"
Is that Huerter or Klay Thompson out there?
"There was a weird case with the Warriors in the case of Lamelo Ball. Remember they thought they were going to have Klay Thompson for the seconds half of the season, so it makes sense to pass on a guard that would have to sit behind Steph, Klay for certain, likely Wiggins (since Lamelo is big enough to play SF), and if he didn't hit, even behind Poole or JTA. Especially when the best center on their team was a toss-up between Marquese Chriss and 6'8"" two-way player Omari Spellman. Let's not forget too that Wiseman is supposed to be able to play a bit on the perimeter."
"Yeah, if Kawhi came back too early and completely tore his ACL then he'd most likely have to miss all of next season (for comparison's sake, Klay Thompson tore his ACL on June 10, 2019 and missed the whole next season recovering from that). If Kawhi's ACL injury was mild enough that he can avoid surgery he should just count his blessings and rest up for next year rather than push it and make it much, much worse. If Chris Paul is actually back tomorrow then the odds are good the Clippers are gonna be down 3-0 anyway."
"Not sure about Cade, who hasn't played an NBA game yet, or Hayes, who was injured for most of his rookie year.   However, Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart have already established their roles and skillsets.   Bey was one of the best sharpshooters in that class, shooting 38% on 6 attempts per game. In fact, he made more 3s his rookie year than anyone else in his class period. With improvements on the defensive end, he will be a 3 and D wing ala Klay Thompson or Joe Harris. Even without D, Kyle Korver managed to have a fruitful 17 season career and was even an All Star.   Stewart was the best center in the class, full stop. He was easily the best rim protector in the entire class and he had a clean scoring touch around the rim and even the ability to pop the 3 every now and again. There is a reason Pistons fans are trying to get him to meet with Ben Wallace because he's Ben Wallace but with the ability to score."
"The last players that the Warriors picked was Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green just exclude the rest  I think they got this"
The majority of major US cities are nice places to live in. Klay Thompson once said that if you can't find out a way to have fun in any city then you probably just aren't a fun person.
"We missed out on the greatest Olympic Men’s Basketball team because of the pandemic and injuries. Yes, better than ‘92  LeBron James Anthony Davis  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard Klay Thompson Steph Curry  Dame Lillard  Draymond Green Bam Adebayo  James Harden Chris Paul  Devin Booker"
It’s gonna be hawks vs bucks after this series. No knicks at all.  4-1 loss isn’t worthy of a Christmas day spot. Lakers gonna play nets obviously.  And warriors are 100% gonna play with a heathy klay Thompson and who ever they get when they trade there picks and Kelly oubre for another all star
"John Wall, Klay Thompson, Tobias Harris, Kristaps"
"Golden state is in a tough spot. I think that given no other moves and the warriors use the picks here, they are probably a top four team in the West if Klay Thompson comes back healthy and are about what they were this year if he doesn't.  It's nice to discuss trades for nice players, but who is Golden State getting in return? Who is the realistic Target that Golden State can trade for that works financially and gets you over the top enough to make it worth giving up all of the lottery picks for?"
"All of a sudden r/nba has deemed Ja Morant ""unlikeable,"" like Pat Bev, Marcus Morris, and half of Klay Thompson."
"Even Salt Lake City?  I remember that a few years ago the Warriors had a bunch of time there, and a bunch of the players were trying to figure out something to do (because there's not much compared to other places).  They ended up going to an escape room, lol:  https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/warriors-curry-mocks-nightlife-backlash-slc-insta-12536656.php  &gt;Steph Curry mocks last year's 'nightlife' backlash with funny Salt Lake City Instagram  &gt;Who says Salt Lake City doesn't have #nightlife?  &gt;A year after the Warriors' ""nightlife"" comments lit up Twitter, Stephen Curry made light of the pseudo-controversy with a tongue-in-cheek Instagram post on Monday night. In the photo, the team poses at an escape room in Salt Lake City. The caption: #nightlife.  &gt;In case you missed last year's weakest Warriors controversy, here's what went down: During the Western Conference playoffs, ESPN asked the Warriors if they preferred the nightlife in Los Angeles or Utah during their between-games downtime.  &gt;""No comparison. There's no such thing, man,"" then-Warriors forward Matt Barnes said. ""There's no nightlife in Utah.""  &gt;**""The problem with Utah is that you're just sitting there and your mind is, like, dead**, because in L.A., you still got energy for the game,"" added Andre Iguodala. ""Because you're in L.A., you're like, 'Man, this is just the vibe in L.A.' but in Utah, it can kind of lull you to sleep.""  &gt;Soon after the story broke, ""nightlife"" started trending on Twitter. The ""Visit Salt Lake"" tourism bureau even shared a two-minute video highlighting the city's attractions called, ""There's Nothing to Do in Salt Lake.""  &gt;Luckily, it looks like the Warriors found some of the elusive Salt Lake City nightlife this year. Omri Casspi, Draymond Green, JaVale McGee (and his fanny pack), Nick Young, Zaza Pachulia, Jordan Bell and Andre Iguodala all appear in the escape room snap with Curry. Missing are Klay Thompson (probably playing ""Call of Duty"") and Kevin Durant (perhaps the photographer).  &gt;According to its website, the Escape Key has four different rooms with mad scientist lab, Sherlock Holmes, Russian spy and CSI themes. In case you were worried they didn't make it out, McGee posted proof that they did.  &gt;""The champs made it out the escape room,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""TeamWork make the DreamWork!"""
Elimination Game 6 Klay Thompson
"No disrespect meant to ky, but with James as the primary ball handler his usefulness goes down a lot. He becomes a bailout option or a spot up shooter, and he is just too skilled to be used that way. We're missing out on some greatness while he's on the nets.   The nets would be better with a elite 3 and D guy, a Klay Thompson type player."
"Oh I agree there are teams that would do it, personally I just wouldn’t. And I’m not saying with the right key pieces they would not be a great team. But I think Giannis needs a cold shooter, Middleton is good but I think to make a winning championship team with him you either gotta have a klay Thompson with him or Middleton and add a better shooter to the guard position. I love jru holiday too but again, it’s not the best price for Giannis, but at the time was undoubtedly the best option on table."
A lot of it depends on what level of Klay Thompson comes back.
"The part you don't get, this is not a game but real life. People are involved, people that are cult legend and symbols for the team.  You want to trade Klay Thompson for Jay Crowder and Reggie Jackson.. In Bulgaria We have a saying, this is like Trading a horse for a chicken straight up"
"&gt; Jaylen Brown  &gt; Bam Adebayo  &gt; Klay Thompson  &gt; DeAndre Ayton  &gt; Ja Morant  All of these guys are very good defenders outside of Morant, but his offense more than makes up for it.  Look dude you got shown up and proven wrong, just take the L and say thanks for the education. Idk why that's so hard on this sub ha"
Lolol! Where is Prince at now?   He deadpanned that Kawhi/Klay Thompson style.
ya reggie jackson turned into klay thompson. so........
Does Bridges think he's Klay Thompson. Chill out and move the ball.

One lightly used Klay Thompson for Giannis who says no
"They played for us, but both 2017 November/December Mirotic and 2018 Sean Killdraftpick certainly turned into prime MJ and absolutely dismantled our chances at a better pick  Not a scrub, but we also got to witness something worse than game 6 klay thompson"
What? It's the Olympics...pretty disappointing this question needs to be asked. I'm guessing the OP is &lt; 16 years old.   You think theses dudes aren't hooping over the summer anyway? Hello Klay Thompson. With the Olympics you also have the best trainers and staff to support you. This sub is dumb af sometimes lol
Nope. Nuggets definitely should trade their elongated Klay Thompson for a PG who can't shoot and best offensive ability clashes with their franchise player because why the fuck not.
If this sub can have posts about Klay Thompson riding a boat it can handle posts about Kevin Durant playing basketball with and against other NBA players in the olympics. Imagine if this sub existed during the dream team run and no one posted about it lmao
"I wouldn't say never. There's been many great defenders who started off as poor defenders in the NBA. Marc Gasol, Kevin Durant, Andrew Bogut, James Harden (when he wants to), Klay Thompson, Blake Griffen, you could even throw Lebron in here. Most offensively elite young stars were never taught to care about defense. It's the offensive ability that gets them into the league. Usually it takes until near the end of their rookie deal for them to become solid defenders as they adjust to learning hundreds of defensive plays."
Literally the second Google result:    [Warriors’ Klay Thompson makes plea for justice for Elijah McClain](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-klay-thompson-makes-plea-justice-elijah-mcclain)    [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CB2HarNnVYb/)
"ya I get what you mean and in a situation like a free dunk ya that person basically doesnt deserve much credit. in a lot of other situations even involving open shots its much less clear. if someone drives and kicks to a 3pt shooter who is open they do still deserve a lot of credit for the play, but whether you are passing to Klay thompson or Kyle kuzma is a big difference and thats why someone like Klay still deserves a lot of credit even if their stats are a result of someone else creating a play. I think the situations where the player who scored deserves little credit are the exception. But ya I think we can agree how good someone is at ""playmaking"" is really hard to measure"
No it’s really not. I’m comparing them to the Warriors. He doesn’t fill the Klay Thompson role
"So add Klay Thompson to those Wolves teams and they would have made the playoffs too? That isn't an argument against Kat, if anything it shows that it takes more than just one All-Star to really carry a team, which the wolves do not have."
"I'm an Aussie and obviously am a huge fan of the Boomers, so I am a bit biased, but I honestly think the Olympic environment would do him a lot of good. Many players, including Dwayne Wade and Kobe Bryant have cited their Olympic experiences as massively helpful for their development. LeBron raved in 2008 about how seeing Kidd's work ethic completely optimized his game.  The injury risks are overblown. It's not like the players aren't hooping over the summer anyway (hi Klay Thompson), and they have access to the absolute best trainers and doctors in the world. Also it's the goddamn Olympics and there's nothing cooler."
"Look, I don't know shit about ACL injuries, I'm not a doctor, I'm just going by what stuff like [this guy](https://youtu.be/d2iDnKPyxvw) was saying when it happened. You're genuinely not worried he could come back early and re-injure himself? Klay Thompson tore his ACL on June 10th of 2019 and he missed the entire next season recovering from it. Do you want to risk that with Kawhi?  For the record [I felt the same way with AD when he injured his groin.](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nqu1dc/z/h0dt75v) I didn't want him to come back and make it worse or hurt something else. It's cause I want next season to be something I look forward to rather than just a write off. Kawhi is gonna do whatever he wants to do and what the doctors say, but it's not like trying to play through an ACL injury carries no real risk."
"Steph Curry,  Klay Thompson,  Kevin Durant,  Lebron James,  Draymond Green"
"And that's fair too. I'm not too convinced that Klay is going to be as great after these injuries, specifically on the defensive end, but I wouldn't be too surprised if I'm completely wrong either.  I hope he does come back strong though. I actually can't stand Klay Thompson or Draymond, but I'm a huge Curry fan and want to see him at least compete, and he likely won't be doing that without Klay and Draymond."
"If you are going to use injuries, the Golden State Warriors could have really used Klay Thompson in either of the play-in games?"
Basically Klay Thompson with some handles?
Completely true. Bridges has the potential to be the next klay thompson
"Pro am league. Highly recommend to watch. Has showcased some high talent players who aren't even in the league.  Some of Cali's top players like Harden, DeRozan, Nick Young, etc play in it. Lamelo played in it before so has Lonzo. Oneyka Okongwu, Trae Young,  Montrez, Russ, even Klay Thompson back in the day. Randle and Marvin Bagley also. Hell even LeBron like 5-8 years ago. Mainly a mixture of NBA players and overseas players. Even just dudes that train to just play for the Drew and just hoop."
"Also, yeah, let's not ignore that both Warriors titles came when Draymond was important to Steph....and the Warriors also had - drawing a blank here - oh, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson."
Which is a deepfake overlay of Klay Thompson footage
"This Warriors ownership and front office *really* want to be the next Spurs.   That means developing the next batch of talent while you still got your current but aging core.   I know Wiseman wasn't great his rookie year but he showed lots of potential, Poole is looking like he's a year away from winning a 6MOY award, and the Warriors have two cracks at lotto picks in this draft.   They've developed some bench talent, guys like Poole of course, but Damion Lee gave good bench minutes, Bazemore (who will almost certainly be back) gave good minutes off the bench despite some of his frustrating fouling/turn over tendencies, Mulder's not great but he's another shooter, can defend a little better than first thought, and has continuity with the team.   Juan Tuscano Anderson has been a great find, very hard nosed, tough, plays good defense and has out of nowhere this season decided he can hit open 3's.   I hope they can bring back Oubre, Jessup will get a chance to prove he deserves a roster spot during summer league, but a couple other guys should be off the roster.   When I look at the roster the Warriors might be fielding next season:  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Andrew Wiggins  Draymond Green  Kevon Looney  Jordan Poole  Kelly Oubre (maybe)  Juan Toscano-Anderson  Damion Lee  Michael Mulder   a couple lottery picks  1 or 2 ring chasing veterans  I feel like that's a roster that can compete for a title with any team I've watched play in this year's playoffs."
"**REGULAR SEASON**  Bogi (6'6 220): 16.5pts, 3.3ast, 3.6reb, 1.1 stl, 3.3 3PM on 44% 3P%  Huerter (6'7 190): 11.9pts, 3.5ast, 3.3reb, 1.2stl, 2.0 3PM on 36% 3P%  **REGULAR SEASON (POST-ASB)**  Bogi: 18.7pts, 3.7ast, 3.7reb, 1.4stl, 3.7 3PM on 46% 3P% (48.9FG%)  Huerter: 11.7pts, 3.3ast, 3.0reb, 1.1stl, 1.9 3PM on 36% 3P (43.9FG%)  Bogdanovic is Klay Thompson-lite, Huerter has a ways to go imo."
"&gt;If you think Klay Thompson doesn’t fix the Warriors woes on offense and defense then you’re an idiot. At least I’m not a fan of a poverty franchise with trash management. Your team sucks period. Your team wasted a generational talent in Kevin Garnett and ran him out of Minnesota. You wasted the likes of Kevin Love and Jimmy Butler deservedly left your team out of disgust.  So instead of focusing on the argument you go on a tangent how my team is bad lmao. And you owe this ""accursed"" franchise 5 of your rings lmao."
Missing Klay Thompson is why the Warriors didn’t make the playoffs
He's not a superstar like some of these other guys but a healthy Klay Thompson is possibly the most ideal plug and play guy in the NBA
Easily this. Add Klay thompson to that mix too. That's the reason why GSW was so overpowered
"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ———————————-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn’t the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"
"So you got him over Devin Booker? Klay Thompson? Hell CJ and Demar? You tripping  Edit: Trolling, I respect it"
Me in 2018: LOL. Too raw to be Klay Thompson.  Me in G7: He's obviously going to be Klay Thompson.
"Light skinned? This is so far past skin tone it ain't even funny. Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Trae Young, Steve Kerr, John Stockton, Bill Laimbeer, Steve Nash, Larry Bird, Devin Booker etc are all light skinned or white and they beat that dummy into the ground as players. One of the most useless fucking players since James Harden I swear."
"You could drop klay Thompson on any team in the nba and he will immediately have a positive impact without changing their offense. If you were going in to game 7 of the finals, you could comfortably add him as a starter and know that your offense will be better. He doesn't need the ball, but he is dangerous when he has it. You can run plays for him, but he can get open on his own. He plays defense as a high level even if his shot isn't falling."
Nah bro he’s just like Klay Thompson only he can’t shoot at all.
"60s: Bill Russell and the Celtics dominants the decade winning 9/10. Wilt Chamberlain sets amazing records unbroken to this day.    Important players: Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Elgin Baylor and Jerry West  70s: Rough decade, several teams win championships. Kareem emerges as the best player.   Important players: Kareem Abdul Jabar, Pete Maravich, John Havelick, Julius Erving and Oscar Robertson  80s: NBA starts to become more popular. Celtics and Lakers, led by Larry Bird and Magic Johnson respectively, win most of the titles in the decade finished off by the Detroit Pistons winning back to back. Michael Jordan, a young shooting guard from Chicago, is seen as a basketball phenom.   Important players: Kareem Abdul Jabar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Moses Malone, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Isaiah Thomas  90s: The decade belongs to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. With his high flying moves, incredible defense and an unmatched determination, They win 6 championships, including three straight twice. Michael Jordan is regarded as the best basketball player to ever play. Hakeem Olajuwon wins a couple in the middle of the 90s, arguably best defensive player of all time.   important players: Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Reggie Miller and Shaquille O’Neal  00s: Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal win 3 straight for the Lakers as an amazing duo. Shaq becomes one of the most physically dominant players to live. The San Antonio Spurs hang around all decade winning 3 championships behind spectacular power forward, Tim Duncan. Super Teams era begin with Kevin Garnett, Paul Piece and Ray Allen teaming up in the early 30s to win a championship for the Boston Celtics. In 2003, a 17 year old named Lebron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers begins dominating the NBA Important players: Shaq, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Steve Nash, Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, Manu Ginobli, Kevin Garnett and Dirk Nowitski.   2010s: Lebron becomes best player since MJ winning 3 championships, two coming from a super team he formed with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat. Not to be denied, the Spurs and the Dallas Mavericks beat Lebron’s Heat. In 2013, a point guard named Stephen Curry begins to change how basketball is played by shooting three point shots at an efficiency, difficulty level and volume that broke defenses. Armed with a lethal shot and an amazing team with Klay Thompson and Draymomd Green, Stephen Curry led the Golden State Warriors to 5 straight championships, winning 3. Kevin Durant joined the warriors in 2016, after losing to Currys Warriors, and to the dismay of many NBA fans, helped the warriors win the final two championships they won in decade.   Important players: Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russel Westbrook, Chris Paul and Giannis Antetekumpo."
"Lots of bad comments, wow.  Ok a basic rundown.  60s era NBA was very different because there was the NBA and the American Basketball Association, the ABA. Eventually, the two merged into just the NBA. Back then there were like 9 NBA teams and the Celtics dominated with Bill Russell. Wilt Chamberlain was the other behemoth that ran around and poured stats. Theres a YouTube channel called Wilt Chamberlain Archives that has lots of great stuff on Wilt and Bill.  After that we had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the Bucks and he's the current all-time career point-getter in the NBA. He had a crazy skyhook and eventually went to be a Laker. There were lots of other stars I'm kinda skipping over in this so you're gonna need to read up. I honestly think that playing the NBA2K games can be a good entry point to learn because they have a ton of classic teams. Anyway when Kareem was a Laker they drafted a rookie named Magic Johnson and he and Larry Bird from the Celtics tore ass through the NBA in the 80s and are credited for saving the NBA because it's ratings in the 70s were really bad.  Late 80s, Michael Jordan gets drafted 3rd by the Bulls and he starts winning championships in the league in his late 20s and after. His Bulls teams are widely considered to be the best teams ever. After he retired in 2003 the focus shifted to Kobe and Shaq who were winning rings with the Lakers until Shaq left for the Heat. While this was happening, LeBron was playing really well on really bad Cleveland teams.   LeBron makes the finals in 2008 basically by himself and loses to Tim Duncan's Spurs which are considered one of the most well-balanced and well-coaches teams ever. Popovich is the Spurs coach still and is widely regarded as the GOAT coach.   LeBron left for the Heat a few years later and won a few rings in Miami. He also lost a Finals round to Dirk Nowitzkis Mavericks and he caught a LOT of heat for it because he wasn't terribly impressive by LeBron standards.  After that he went back to Cleveland and Steph and Klay Thompson break the NBA with their shooting and win 73/82 games in a season, which is better than any other team has done in the regular season. Despite that, they managed to lose to Lebron's Cavs in the finals. Because the Warriors only went 73/82 and clearly needed some help, they signed Kevin Durant and tore ass through the league until recently when KD left for the Nets and LBJ went to LA.  Since then you're basically caught up. I skipped a shitton of stuff so you'll need to do some more reading on some other fun and important teams like the Nash Suns, Melo Knicks, Rose Bulls, Pierce/KG Celtics, and so on."
"&gt;if Ben could be somewhat like Dray, then maybe  Maybe if Seth was Steph and Tobias Harris was Klay Thompson"
"Maybe because he has Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant for two of those rings! Y'all are capping right now. Ben had 13 assists with 2 turnovers tonight. Jesus Christ! These hit takes are pathetic!"
Next klay thompson?
"Well, he's basically ginger Klay Thompson..."
Ginger Klay Thompson
"I cannot believe this fucking timeline, man. Joel Embiid and Ben ""A jumpshot away from being LeBron James"" Simmons just got eliminated by the Italian Stallion and Ginger Klay Thompson.  What the fuck."
Kevin Huerter is basically Klay Thompson on 2k. Nice to see him do it on the big stage in real life
"Kevin ""Klay Thompson"" Heurter???"
Is Kevin Huerter Klay Thompson now?
Klay Thompson going off tonight
Kevin Huerter is also playing like game 6 Klay Thompson so I feel like that balances it out.
Huerter needs to be drug tested. Went from one of the worst players in the league to Klay Thompson this series.
Kevin Huerter is just bad but is playing like Klay Thompson this series
Those are Klay Thompson numbers!
"Jordan’s bulls were always favored because the 90s was a watered down league. Dennis Rodman even said it that those bulls teams could beat anyone at the time with there eyes closed because of how watered down the league was. I didn’t see Jordan playing any teams in the finals that looked like the warriors with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durrant, Andre Igudalla, Draymon Green, among the stacked bench players….. Jordan NEVER had to play any teams in the finals that looked like that LMFAO. That’s why Jordan’s teams were always favored cause they were the best TEAM in the league in a watered down era. Deal with it."
what if we added a prime klay thompson? he's someone who can provide some good 3&amp;D.
How the fuck did Reggie Jackson happen?  Teams that sign these under the radar dudes that play like prime Klay Thompson are obviously going to be a problem.
Draymond and his 8 PPG &gt; Klay Thompson and his flamethrower according to the nephews in this thread
"I don’t think your crazy.  Middleton has long been an under appreciated player.  This would have to kick off a couple year run of greatness though.   Asking another way, Klay Thompson or Kris Middleton?  I don’t think that’s a crazy question"
Just wait until Klay Thompson
"If those shooters were Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry and prime Ray Allen, then yes, he would become a great"
"I think that's a bullshit reason (not you, Draymond of course). There was 5 seconds in the game. Doing anything risky like passing to an eventual trailing player seems misguided. 5 seconds left in the game is iso time, but even then, racing to the other side of the court in 5 seconds isn't even ""iso"" play.  Plus if you watch, the moment Draymond passes half court he has 2 seconds left and 4 defenders on him. No way he's getting a pass off to KD or Klay at that point.  Plus Plus, Draymond HAD a trailing Klay Thompson behind him. If he wanted to pass to a trailing player, he had his supposed opportunity, although like I said, 4 defenders and 2 seconds left means a clean pass is unlikely."
"“Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are the best shooters I’ve played with,” Durant said. “Joe Harris is definitely right up there, getting there.”"
Kyrie has has more freak injuries than anyone.  2015 - knee cap broken because klay Thompson hit the exact spot where he had a rock embedded in his knee from a childhood skateboarding accident 2018 - infection when removing the wire holding knee cap together 2021 - giannis bullshit box out that gave kyrie no room t land
6'6 KD is just Klay Thompson
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-says-joe-harris-is-right-up-there-with-stephen-curry-klay-thompson-as-a-shooter/amp/
"See Smith, JR. Or Thompson, Klay."
"I mean there was nothing else HOU could do. Warriors were playing physical defense in the paint and HOU was getting 0 calls so they switched to perimeter shooting and their shots just didn’t fall. There’s no gameplan that can prepare James Harden, Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, and Clint Capela to beat Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green... especially in a shootout"
Joe Harris is just like Klay Thompson
"You're talking about the LeBron that was a year older than KD is right now? Had played through 3 rounds of the playoffs including 2 grueling 7-game series? Had carried an awful and dysfunctional Cavs team playing all 82 games, averaging almost 37 min a game? Who dropped 51 points in a game where only 2 of his teammates hit double digit points? Who was being guarded by in their primes Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant?  That Lebron James?"
2015 Game 6 Klay Thompson for the Championship: 5 points.
"Disingenuous argument lol. Klay Thompson scored 60, so he must be a great self creator as well"
Honestly in the moment I thought Bron was going to win it cause of his effort and it was truly one of those “I’m carrying this fucking squad” moments. Yeah he was not efficient but his 2nd best player was Mozgov.  Lebron James  Steph Curry   Iggy  Klay Thompson   Draymond  Mozgov   Barnes   Jr Smith  Delly  The Warriors just had such a better overall team
I remember someone saying that he was better than Klay Thompson. It was wild.
"If what you're saying is that a messed-up back makes you play worse...well then that, exactly. He was a worse player than if he didn't. Kind of like how Klay Thompson wasn't an all star this year. We expect that he would have performed to an all-star level if he hadn't gotten injured...but the reality remains that he didn't perform to an all-star level."
"Randle and Conley were all-stars that got left out, with Randle being a dark horse MVP candidate.  Can't hold a candle to Duncan ""The White Klay Thompson"" Robinson.  Understandable."
"Middleton is not consistent enough as a second star - so despite having enough skill for the role, he's just not good enough. You can have 1 prime MJ quarter, 3 Klay Thompson quarters, and 8 Lonzo Ball (Lakers days version) quarters every 3 games.   Jrue sadly is also not living up to the 3rd star role. His defense and team play are top notch but he's on a max contract, that's simply not enough production.  It all starts with these two."
"Yeah since All star and all nba nods Klay Thompson and Draymond Green didn’t contribute to that record at all. You have to be a child bro, this is a ridiculous argument."
That's what happens if Klay Thompson doesn't play 2+ seasons otherwise they would've broken it by now
"3 best shooting guards of most recent times are Klay Thompson (more of a catch and shoot guy), Demar Derozan (who's more of a 3-4 now, and is the poorest man's Kobe who doesn't shoot 3s), and James Harden (who is more of a PG).  Booker can't be compared to those guys (maybe Derozan, but he shoots 3s), and he doesn't play like Dwyane Wade. So it's hard not to do the Kobe comparison."
He's basically the same as Klay Thompson. Warriors were just a better team so his bad games weren't instant losses
Devin 'klay Thompson' Booker
The disrespect to Klay Thompson in these comments is real
fuck klay thompson
"that block play looked dangerous, coulda been a Klay Thompson ending..."
"PG: Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving (Efficiency is unmatched at guard, 50-40-90 club guys and champions. Ky was National Team MVP before)  SG: James Harden, Klay Thompson, Devin Booker (Need some D)  SF: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard (I mean....No explanation needed)  PF: LeBron James, Jayson Tatum, Paul George  C: Anthony Davis, Karl Antony Towns (So many goods ones not from U.S)"
Josh Smith is not as good as Klay Thompson 😭
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De’Aaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
"But he is not good at being ""the"" guy. He is great at being the third guy who plays great defense, works hard offball to get himself or teammates open and can make shots at a very good rate when he gets passed the ball.  Once you have two star ballhandlers, the klay thompson-type becomes much more valuable than another ballhandler you have to hide on D.  If there was no max and you could spend 70% of your salary cap on one player klay would not be a max player but the way the cap is structured now he absolutely is."
"Klay ""Troy 'Butt Soup' Barnes"" Thompson"
1 healthy Klay Thompson would have been nice  Or KAT/Zion if we're adding any random player
Klay Thompson is officially my new Spirit Animal.
The funny part would be if GSW ends up with Love without giving up Klay Thompson like they considered back in [2014](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2069317-report-warriors-dont-want-to-trade-klay-thompson-in-kevin-love-deal).
"He is still a major injury risk.. additionally, his handles and defense has to improve a lot. He plays like klay Thompson without the defense"
"Klay ""Captain Wack"" Thompson"
Where is half of Klay Thompson smh
"People acting dismissive but that's impressive as fuck.  He was the second option on a team bereft of good offensive players outside of Jokic and still put up numbers night in and night out.  Klay Thompson, someone who is plays a similar role on offense to MPJ, has never put up numbers that good."
Klay Thompson
"Klay ""Captain Stabbin"" Thompson"
That Klay Thompson take is spicy and I love it
"Klay ""are you for scuba"" Thompson"
&gt; As awesome as Klay is and as great as he’d be at drawing in clients... the natural world has a lot more appeal than Klay Thompson to pretty much anyone outside this sub  Good point.
"It's not game planning, it's simple NBA defense - if you have Crowder and Bridges shooting over 40% from three, you're going out there to contest their shots lol. If a team had LeBron, Curry and KD on the same team, are you gonna ignore Klay Thompson in the corner?"
"Guess it's in his blood lol.  Mychal is from The Bahamas for those not familiar, so Klay has spent a lot of time visiting.  https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Why-Klay-Thompson-holds-firmly-to-his-Bahamian-13502120.php"
Klay “Troy Barnes” Thompson
I mean he wouldn’t get a job he’d buy a boat and start a company.    As awesome as klay is and as great as he’d be at drawing in clients... the natural world has a lot more appeal than klay Thompson to pretty much anyone outside this sub.
"Lmao just imagine going on vacation to the Bahamas and your guide is former 3x NBA Champion, 5x All Star and the second Greatest Shooter of All Time, Klay Thompson"

That authors name? Klay Thompson
"Star players like the big 4 in Detroit don’t make the all star every year. Idk if you watched the series but all 4 were DEFINITELY star players in their prime in 2004. If you actually watched that series, Rip was the most important player and was already averaging 20 a game. Just because he hadn’t made an all star at that point doesn’t mean he wasn’t a star.   Steph is a superstar. Klay was a star and Draymond was a role player. Klay Thompson might have been the 2 guard in the league but that’s likely because all the best wing players were SFs lol. I mean who was second at the time? Derozan. Klay averaged 22 a game at that point which are star, not superstar, numbers. Draymond was never a star. I don’t care how many all stars he made he didn’t dominate in any category outside of perimeter defense. Having great perimeter defense does not make you a star (Tony Allen)"
Really missed an opportunity. Should be Klay Thompson driving that boat.
"&gt;Iggy and Draymond’s offensive creation is entirely dependent on the threat of Steph and Klay’s shooting  Might be one of the dumber statements i have heard. Draymond is the offensive creator Steph and Klay both play of ball. Iggy was a 19-20p scorer when he was with Philadelphia.   &gt;Thompson is the only 20+ point scorer out of those dudes so Idk wym by they have 3 20 point scorers outside of Steph  Both Barnes and Igoudala has averaged 20p a game on offenses where they were the main threat outside of GSW. Way to show you have no idea about the NBA at all.   &gt;Steph has a 17.9 game score for the series and Iggy’s was 13.6.  It's a 20 percent gap on a stat that doesn't measure defense. If Stephs offense is only 20% better than Iggys than doesn't deserve FMVP.  &gt;fact that you’re acting like 59% true shooting is poor efficiency is laughable (especially considering that’s exactly what Iggy had too and you called that efficient)  Yeah but Iggy brings other things. That is the point. Iggy's value isn't tied to scoring. Steph only brings scoring.   &gt;Also when was Steph’s defense an issue at any point that series? The fact that you’re calling 2015 Iggy, Dray, and Harry B legit 20 point scorers makes me think your borderline trolling rn.  Barnes averaged 19,2p the season after he left GSW. He was lacking opportunity not ability, same with Iggy. It is also stupid you get caught up in this. The point was that there were a ton of good offensive players on that team outside of Curry.      Jason Lloyd who voted for MVP had the most concise explanation of why Iggy was MVP.  &gt;*Two defining factors shaped my final vote: In my mind James had to get it to a Game 7 and Iguodala’s insertion into the starting lineup changed everything. His on/off numbers were indicative of this entire series. When Iguodala was off the court, LeBron shot 44 percent and the Cavs outscored the Warriors by 30 points. When Iguodala was on the court, he was James’ primary defender. James shot 38 percent and the Warriors outscored the Cavs by 55. If the Warriors didn’t have Iguodala, the Cavs would’ve won this series. That’s pretty valuable in my eyes.*"
"We need dudes over 6’9”, not slow Klay Thompson"
"Iggy and Draymond’s offensive creation is entirely dependent on the threat of Steph and Klay’s shooting. They aren’t playmakers, they’re passers. And what about Harrison Barnes? I guarantee you nobody is sweating over any offense led by Barnes. Thompson is the only 20+ point scorer out of those dudes so Idk wym by they have 3 20 point scorers outside of Steph and even then Klay is notoriously bad at creating for himself and others relative to star players. Plus Game Score? Is that the end all be all for u? Steph has a 17.9 game score for the series and Iggy’s was 13.6. The gap between their scores is the virtually same as the gap between Iggy and Klay’s performances and the fact that you’re acting like 59% true shooting is poor efficiency is laughable (especially considering that’s exactly what Iggy had too and you called that efficient). Also when was Steph’s defense an issue at any point that series? The fact that you’re calling 2015 Iggy, Dray, and Harry B legit 20 point scorers makes me think your borderline trolling rn."
Trade Steph curry and klay Thompson to the hawks for Brandon Goodwin and Bruno Fernando
Paul George? Klay Thompson?
Klay Thompson on 5/8/2013 went 13-of-26 with no FT attempts. But that was not in the Finals.  Just like Holiday’s 25 FG attempts with no FT against the Hawks last series…. Just wasn’t in the Finals.
lmao yeah I am not going to challenge Klay fucking Thompson to a shooting contest. What about shitposting? Though maybe he has me beat there too
"Did bro really think he was starting over Klay fuckin Thompson? The dude that helped get 3 rings, vs the dude that didn’t help get them out of the play in tournament? Talk about delusional."
Klay Thompson in the new Space Jam? Okay I’m watching
"Literally any alteration of a jump can seriously screw your joints (see: Klay Thompson), but that doesn't mean everything about a landing should be flagrant fouls. Trying to defend a jumpshot is a very basic part of basketball and there was nothing excessive about what Lopez actually did on the play.  But like you said, agree to disagree."
"can't shoot threes is an exaggeration, but yeah he has always been more in the mold of a derozan than klay thompson or whatever people said pre-draft."
That was confirmed to be klay. Marcus Thompson said dray loved Kelly
Didn’t it take this guy multiple games just to make a 3 pointer this season? But he thinks it’s unfair that Klay freakin Thompson would take his spot in the starting lineup lol. Can’t be serious.
"Rache "" Miss I voted the last two years for Klay Thompson for all defensive team when in fact she didn't"""
Klay Thompson Rookie of the year 2022
"It's the tentative/inconsistent part that makes him a huge gamble at 15m/year.  Some games he looks like Klay Thompson out there, but in more games he's eminently forgettable.  Not sure yet you can rely on him as a high-level starter or even a key rotation piece."
Joe Harris and Duncan are 82 game players while Klay Thompson is built for the playoffs.  &amp;#x200B;  Both Harris and Duncan have significant drop-offs in career FG% + 3PT% when comparing Regular Season to playoffs while Klay's FG% and 3PT% in the playoffs are higher than his regular-season averages.
"The disrespect!  One of the best perimeter defenders and the ability to go nuclear and drop 50 on any given night.   Personally, I wasn’t a fan of those Warriors teams that went on a run. I respected them, but I wasn’t a fan. But still Klay Thompson was my favorite player in the league. Weird huh, cuz yea he was that good and he was chill and gave the best interviews."
Klay Thompson
So do you consider Klay Thompson a role player since he's just the 3&amp;D archetype taken to the extreme?
Can I also get Klay Thompson please
"watch him on offense, he plays like Klay does when Draymond is facilitating out of the high post. That is why I think his offensive potential is closer to a Klay Thompson than to a KD or Steph Curry. he will never be a primary scorer, but can be a deadly off ball option. He also has the talent to be a good defender, I just don't think he has good focus or understanding on defense yet..."
it's almost like.. get this.. players can have impact outside of just scoring.  klay thompson was the best shooter in that series and him simply being on the floor adds a TON of spacing even if his shot isnt falling. they're not gonna suddenly stop guarding him. oh and he's one of the best perimeter defenders in the game.
 &gt; The Warriors were down 3-1 in the NBA finals with both a healthy Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry  I don’t really care anymore but Klay didn’t play the fourth quarter of game two or game three at all -_-
"Klay Thompson, hasn’t gotten any PT since 2019"
One of the worst defenders in the game is a super sized Klay Thompson? Lolwut
The only easy part was the small part without Klay Thompson and KD. Every other part was still legit.
"What does that have to do with her job as moderator of NBA countdown, the thing we’re actually discussing?  And if you want to talk about terrible award votes we can go on about Rachel Nichols and her dumb narrative based talking points she brings up + her Klay Thompson all defensive team votes. I’ll agree that neither deserve a ballot and the NBA has to do better about their voting, but that has nothing to do with this."
"2019 Raptors still had to go through a stacked 76ers team with Embiid and Butler, a 60+ win bucks team, and Steph Curry playing at his best (and Klay Thompson balling out for 4.5 games). Even with KD out that Warriors team still had most of the core players of their 73 win team"
So does Klay Thompson not exist anymore?
Klay Thompson
"This is why context matters…  Kid was 19yr old late first round pick starting his rookie season for Klay Thompson on a team that just went to 5 straight NBA finals and just lost: KD, Klay, Livingston, Iguadala and then Steph 3 games in to the season that was derailed halfway through due to COVID and lockdowns.   No NBA rookie, let alone a young raw late 1st rd pick would be able to succeed getting thrown to the fire like that.   He always had flashes of being a great playmaker, his stroke looked nice and he had a ton of confidence, the ball just wasn’t going in the basket.   After his first stint to the G league his rookie season, he already came back a new player and we knew going in to the off season he’d make a huge leap if he could get some consistency on his jumper.   Well, credit to him, he continued to work his ass off and his leap this year wasn’t really a surprise."
You def got him there but I don't think he's wrong. For example Klay Thompson doesn't really create any shots for himself he's a catch and shoot player but you would still Max him. Bridges can be great too. Not saying Klay great lmao but great in his own right.
Klay Thompson
"Ray Allen and Allen Iverson were drafted the same year and in their primes at the same time. In which AI won 4 scoring titles, an MVP, got the #1 seed and led his team to the finals as the #1 guy, ~10x all stars and 7x all NBA's. Including multiple 1st teams.  Ray Allen had like 6 all stars, 2 all NBA teams. Never took his team that far as the #1 guy, including losing to MVP AI straight up. Literally no one, and I mean no one would take Ray Allen over Allen Iverson from 1996 to 2008. Which is the bulk of both of their careers. Ray got a couple rings as a role player in his mid 30s, so what?  It would be like saying Klay Thompson was better than Dame Lillard today."
I only have one jersey and it is a Klay Thompson Oaktown. He's what a professional basketball player needs to be.
Chris Paul  Klay Thompson  Paul George  Anthony Davis  Nikola Jokic  I built a team around him
"&gt;  injuries are part of the process.  While this is true, usually it's for role players. It's different when it's the stars. There's a difference between Klay Thompson being injured and even Andrew Bogut for example."
Living my best life through Klay Thompson ༼ つ  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ༽つ
"No doubt. Paul Pierce was fking hilarious and I loved it. And he is of course stamped as a basketball player. Nephews/people just didn’t realize he was playing the Chuck/Shaq role and livening up the show. Chauncey was a better respected/spoken Kenny and Jalen/Michelle the straight host.  Even if he’s serious, Paul Pierce is not better than D Wade but there’s nothing wrong with himself saying he is (given his resume), or saying he is a better shooter in the clutch than Klay Thompson. I loved their chemistry. When that ended, I stoped watching ESPN except for Stephen A."
"Yeah I definitely want Iguodala over a lot of guys but three guys I absolutely don't want him over are Steph Curry, Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant."
"Towns, Tatum, a young playmaker, and Klay Thompson beat Bronny James and the Lakers in the finals in 5 years. I’m calling it!"
he woke up and decided to be klay thompson
Paul George and Klay Thompson come to mind
cam reddish randomly decided to be klay thompson tonight
I saw some Hawks fans talking about Huerter as their Klay Thompson. Maybe not.
"There's also tracy mcgrady, vince carter (possibly a SF tho), joe dumars, david thompson, klay thompson. There's a few people that deserve consideration, but I can't fit 15 people on a 10 person list lol"
"Just a bad take man. He just isn’t. You really telling me you could take a non-playoff team, put Klay Thompson on it, and have them be a WCF team? Cmon man. That would take a top 10 player in the league."
Klay Thompson is a national treasure...
"No one actually hates Klay Thompson right? Even with the super team warriors, he’s so likable"
"If there was no play in, they were a first round exit *this year*. You really think adding Klay Thompson makes them no better? Lol."
"Klay Thompson 60 points in 3 quarters, dribbling the ball only 11 times... It truly displayed just how absurd his release is."
Fuck I love Klay Thompson. Always brings the best vibes
**I like watching NBA games very much. Sometimes exciting; I often forget that I sleep just to watch NBA games. Klay Thompson put it very well. This is very good for enhancing the combat effectiveness of oneself and the team.**
"I would say best. His defense and rebounding alone swung a lot of games. His efficiency is next level and although he's an amazing lob finisher he actually has a nice post game package with short jumpers, floaters and fade aways.  Shaq never created his own offense really. Klay Thompson don't create much offense but he can dominate games.   Book and CP3 have been inconsistent throughout the playoffs. CP3 more because of injury and covid. If Book shoots around 40% and CP3 misses a couple games or goes cold I don't see why Ayton shouldn't win."
"100%. I still remember what happened to KD and Klay Thompson in those finals a couple years ago. I know we're close but, a serious injury to Giannis would be seriously dark days."
"I feel like the more i learn about Klay Thompson, the less i know about Klay Thompson."
"I'm sure if Steph got the Warriors to the playoffs and they matched up against the Suns, they would fight valiantly and Steph would most likely put up some ridiculous numbers, but I highly doubt the he alone could push the Suns out of the playoffs. The reason why Steph and Draymond on the floor together makes their offense better is because Steph's floor spacing allows for Draymond to find their teammates easier because the greatest shooter in NBA history demands the defense has to pay extra attention to him. But that still relies on the role players hitting shots, and I don't believe the current Warriors role players are good enough to beat the rest of the Suns WITHOUT Klay Thompson."
"That 73 win team had defenders, playmakers, and KLAY THOMPSON. None of which were available for this current roster of Warriors. That team didn't need a 3rd 20 point scorer because Steph AND Klay are the greatest shooting backcourt ever and Draymond plays much better when both of them are playing. You're not taking offense seriously enough if you think Steph Curry by himself can outscore the whole Suns roster. The fact that you think Draymond is enough to carry your offensive load against the Suns is honestly concerning. If he was that reliable of a scorer, the Warriors wouldn't of missed the playoffs."
"Giannis x Dirk would be a unguardable. Insane athleticism, some of the best post moves ever, DPOY level defense, and Giannis could consistently shoot 3’s and FT’s.  Ben Simmons x Klay Thompson would be an absolute monster too."
"After Curry,  Klay Thompson - First team all rookie  Harrison Barnes - First team all rookie  Patrick McCaw - a decent role player despite being a 2nd round pick. Nothing out of this world but played well and beyond expectations.  Jordan Bell - another 2nd rounder who played well above expectations, much like Pat  Eric Paschall - First team all rookie"
"It was the 2014 offseason, right before the rings. The front office wanted to make a big move and considered trading Klay, Harrison Barnes, and David Lee for Kevin Love. Jerry West blocked the deal.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11108483/golden-state-warriors-add-klay-thompson-possible-kevin-love-trade"
How true is it that Jerry West said he would resign if they traded Klay Thompson?
"It's pretty easy to recognise this.   Golden State with Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are an unstoppable juggernaut.   The Lakers without LeBron and Anthony Davis would not even sniff the playoffs.   You add the right two players to the worst team in the NBA and they're championship level.  Unless you're proposing an achievable pair of additions that will transform the team, then the statement is basically meaningless."
The league better enjoy this time w/o Klay Thompson out there for now cuz I think its gg league when he comes back.
"Why are you only looking at blazers vs warriors lmfao, talk about changing the subject. I thought this was about Curry vs Dame as individual players?   If you want to bring their teams into it, I wonder who’s team would be better— Dame alongside Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant.. and Curry alongside CJ, Melo, and Nurkic who is injured more often than not 🤔. I think we all know the answer"
Klay Thompson
"Idk, as great a shooter Hali is I’d rather have Hali run point because his vision and IQ are outstanding. His ceiling is sky high, I’m talking Luka level high. Turning Hali into a Klay Thompson lite to pair with Fox’ John Wall like tendencies would stunt Halis growth and waste his playmaking potential.  Fox is getting to the rack, playing more aggressive so his fg is higher now short term but I expect some regression. His ft sucks, and ft is considered the best proxy for shooting other than TS%. If Fox can become a better shooter the way Kobe did in his career, it’ll work else Fox will be on the John Wall trajectory. If I’m the kings, I’m watching closely how Fox’ shooting sustains over next few years and whether or not it stunts Halliburton’s growth. If you’re perennially losing and getting blown out year after year, at some point you gotta look deep inside and wonder if you’re part of the problem too (hi John Wall!!).   I’d try and start Hali and Hield in the backcourt and try to move Fox for an all-star wing or lethal rim running center. It will have to be via trade because no FAs will come to SAC."
"Draymond has 27 triples double over his entire career LOL?? sample size miniscule. He plays with Steph curry and klay thompson, lets not act like he is the one winning those games."
"Yeah I disagree, he's not a playmaker at all right now. Offensively he's like Klay Thompson, doesn't need to dribble much I just want him to shoot every time he touches the ball because he's money from everywhere"
"Fun fact, Klay sat the 4th that game  Source: https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/10/29/18041064/klay-thompson-three-point-record-warriors-bulls-headband"
"6'10"" Klay Thompson, with KD efficiency"
"He can just be the Nuggets Klay Thompson, doesn’t really need much playmaking to be effective"
Klay “perplexed by a toaster” Thompson
"He'd basically be a slightly better version of current Ben Simmons. Like Simmons is such a non threat away from the basket, he makes Draymond Green feel like Klay Thompson. Simmons is already elite at pretty much everything else like peak Lebron was but if Lebron didn't have even the threat of a jumper, it would be a lot easier to guard him. Even when Lebron's jumper was at it's weakest he could at least shoot well enough to keep the defense honest."
"Haircut Jayson Tatum, Game 6 Klay Thompson, Michael Jordan after taking it personally"
"It's up there but I think a lot of those ridiculous rebounds that he and Bill Russell had might be a little safer, as well as his 50 points a game, I do think in this offensively explosive era somebody like a Klay Thompson could get nuclear hot one night and Challenge 100.           Jordans 10 scoring titles are also relatively safe and throwing team stuff in there the Boston Celtics winning eight straight"
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vučević: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"

First off, that starting lineup will probably be the most used line up, BUT the bench lineup will NOT be used like that all the time. You might be looking at it and thinking that there isn't enough movement, or shooting, or whatever, but we won't be strictly using that bench ever. Players on that bench will be slotted into specific lineups depending on whos hot or the opponents lineup.  As for the starters, I really like this lineup. The thing with it is, EVERY single player there is a) Elite in passing b) Elite in BBIQ and c) Offers something needed. You have Steph who is always going to be in these lineups, because he offers so much. He barely needs the ball. He has the most gravity of any player bar Shaq and he uses that gravity by stretching the defense into knots to exploit openings and defensive breakdowns. Who do we have to exploit those breakdowns? 4/5 of the team is elite at offense and shooting. People hate on Garnett for not having high volume but that helps here as his efficiency is going to be sorely needed. Steph will be able to facilitate or pass to the facilitator, and because this whole team has great IQ, they can consistently make the most of Steph by tracking his off ball movement to relocate to him or get the open man. Stephs ridiculous shooting is just so reliable. He's also super clutch and is able to act as an ok team defender. It's super obvious he HAS to be here. Able to make circus layups or logo shots, he makes any lineup a threat from 3 BY HIMSELF. (By the way, I chose 2021 Steph as I believe he is at his peak right now. He can handle more contact, can carry better, has higher BBIQ, is stronger and is tougher mentally, all the while arguably shooting better. His only loss is a SLIGHTLY slower first step.)  You have 2018 Lebron who I chose because while people love 2013, his 2018 was just more complete and dominant imo. He can shoot and dial in defensively when needed. With so much talent on this team, Lebron can focus on one specific attribute. If he's in a playmaking/offense filled lineup, we know he's athletic enough to be elite defensively, and he has the help in order to focus on that part of his game. He's acting as a jack of all trades in a way. His main purpose in the majority of his usage will be playmaking though. You got an opening? I have no fear in passing to Lebron because he WILL make the right play. Whether that's a Russell lob or a relocated Steph 3, or a Jordan midrange, or his own shot, I trust him to be the primary ballhandler. Him in 2018 was able to do this best. Just control the game. Lebron can handle any assignment defensively when dialed in, but to conserve his energy, the team he's around will probably be elite defensively. This lets him focus on warping the match with his BBIQ. He acts as the glue of the team in a way.  Then you have Jordan. When it comes down to the clutch, he will ALWAYS be in the lineup. Game on the line, he gets the ball. If we need a 3, Steph gets the ball. You have 2 clutch players and the greatest scorer of all time, Jordan really completes the team. He can pass at an elite level and shoot anywhere, (ideally not the 3, but jesus, look at the team. No way in hell he's the one getting the ball at the 3 line when you have such a good coaching staff, so many high IQ players, so many great passers and so many elite shooters. A non issue.) He is GOING to be the leader of the team. There's a reason I didn't choose Kobe or Wilt. Everyone on this team I believe can live with MJ being the leader, bar potentially Shaq. He might be the biggest risk but he also has the biggest upside, we'll talk about that later. Being able to have the goat scorer on your team who is ALSO the goat in clutch means we have a guy in bailout situations. Just pass it to MJ and he'll make something. He can also work as a 1 since he is an elite passer and has high BBIQ. He rebounds excellently and he can use his athleticism to get anywhere on the court. With any elite facilitator, (We have SO many on the team) that's lethal. He can just fly up and dunk whenever he wants, or rise for a jumpshot. He's going to be the centerpiece of any offense he's in, only ever splitting the cake with Shaq.  Then you have Russell. A lotta people start Shaq, or have Duncan at C, or have Kareem, or have Wilt. I chose Russell because in a team like this, perhaps the most valuable ability is not requiring the ball so much and being able to pass. You already know his purpose. Provide intangibles like leadership and heart, dominate the rim, pass at an elite level, catch lobs, be a defensive beast. There isn't so much to talk about in his role, but that's precisely why I chose him. I don't want a ball dominant guy to dribble the clock for 20 seconds and throw up some fadeaway. I need my center to anchor a defense, protect the rim, switch and pass. Russell does all of that in spades, as the GOAT defender. Speaking of defense.....  What you might have noticed is the balance of the team. 4/5 of this team is elite defensively, 4/5 of this team can shoot reliably, 4/5 of this team is elite offensively in general, 4/5 of this team has elite BBIQ, 4/5 of this team has ridiculous athleticism, 4/5 of this team can rebound great and 5/5 of this team can pass the ball. There won't be a confliction because everybody here can congeal and work as a team. MJ/Kobe/Harden/Wilt/Dirk might seem like a cool team but in reality it won't fit together. This team has essentially no weaknesses. For every Kevin Garnett offensive rebound, there will be a Steph dragging 2 defenders across the field leaving Jordan open for half a second. For every miss, there will be a Russell rebounding to Lebron to pass to the relocated Steph or layup by Russell. For every Bill Russell blocked shot, there will be a clutch MJ basket saving the game. The team works really nicely.  Next, the bench. Now, the bench isn't a lineup but it's players who will be played in certain lineups. Instantly, you have the king of facilitation, Magic. Showtime can slot into any non Lebron lineup as the main ballhandler and will be the engine of that lineup. As they conflict so much, I decided to not have them be on the same starting team. Magic with his height is able to shake things up in a way Steph can't as the backup PG. He can post up or pass and offer a new vitality to the team.  Then you have Klay Thompson. Personally, I can't believe this guy isn't on all time lineups more. He's so perfect for this kind of team. With so many faces who need the ball, you WANT a guy who doesn't even dribble, who shoots at an all time level after catching and goes right back to hunting his defensive assignment. He can pass, won't conflict with egos and stretch the floor when a certain lineup needs it. As a cherry on top, he can guard any guard or wing and do a damn good job.  Then you have Bird. I was originally going to have Durant there but I changed my mind. He's the 2nd clutchest player ever, so having him in non-MJ scenarios would be preferred, it would take some creative lineups to fulfill his potential. Able to stretch the floor like Steph and pass like Lebron, he has elite court vision and can be a leader at any time. Yet another guy who can pass the ball well, noticing a pattern? He will need the ball a bit so having so many passers on this team is great. A lineup of Steph/Klay/Bird/Duncan/Shaq might be a killer when you need offense."
LeBron James  Klay Thompson  Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant  Kevin Garnett  Pippen  Blitz defense  Popovich
"Klay Thompson has averaged 2.3 assists for his career on one of the most dynamic, pass friendly teams in the League. Some guys have a knack for scoring and focus primarily on that objective.   MPJ will be fine finishing on those cuts and receiving the ball from Jokic or shooting that corner 3 after an amazing pass from Jokic. If MPJ develops a pass game in the future, even better for MPJ. If not, he’ll still be a bucket."
Should Klay Thompson not be in this list?
I wish we had a Klay Thompson right now.
Why settle for Klay Thompson when you can get Kevin Durant.  He's got the ceiling for something like a KD lite if he works on those handles
"Literally just read what you wrote. “He can just be our Klay Thompson”. A team would literally kill to have “just a Klay Thompson”, and you guys have a player which you are comfortable with calling Klay Thompson as his floor. I don’t even know if the realization has set in for you. Congratulations man."
"Would help for sure but we don’t even really NEED him to do that, he can just be our Klay Thompson"
"You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Giannis and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another wrestler, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Klay Thompson to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way, at the Finals, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Klay Thompson KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try!  So Giannis, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus my 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning at the Finals. But then you take my 75% chance of winning, if we was to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 per cents, I got 141 2/3 chance of winning at the Finals. See Giannis, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at the Finals."
Steph curry Klay Thompson
[KLAY THOMPSON!!](https://i.imgur.com/rvngS9H.gif?noredirect)
"Klay Thompson is one of the best role players to ever play the game, but he's not a top 10 player. If you built a team around Klay you would not be very good. I don't think you're a top 10 player in the game if you can't handle the ball."
Klay Thompson
Yeah fuck dirty players like him and klay thompson that undercut dudes
"The funniest part to me is that his shot is *ugly* as hell. Just an abomination, multiple motions, stilted. But damn if it ain't pure. Opposite Klay Thompson in some sense"
"They have Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, the goat shooter and arguably the 2nd best shooter of all time. You think they would get a Center and let him post up the whole time?"
The mythology of klay Thompson has people believing a lot of things yes. Don’t want to go down this rabbit hole again but all I’ll say is while all players are byproducts of circumstances they are drafted into with Klay it’s just true to a whole different degree.
It’s hilarious how many people really think klay Thompson is better or even as good as this guy  [this is indeed a high ranking for Reggie in the all time pantheon but it outlines the case for him and the reasons he was underrated pretty well](https://backpicks.com/2018/01/18/backpicks-goat-29-reggie-miller/)
Klay thompson makes those same reckless plays to other players
"This.  I sat down my non-American partner to watch an NFL game from the opening kickoff so I could explain what the hell was going on since she was interested.  Basketball is a lot easier to figure out, though, and all she needed to interest her enough to learn basketball on the go was Klay Thompson."
You could’ve just stopped after Klay Thompson haha
"Gentle reminder that the Warriors are missing: Klay Thompson, Marquese Chriss, James Wiseman, Eric Paschall, Kent Bazemore and Damion Lee."
I think klay thompson had a lot more to do with it
People have genuinely forgotten how good Klay Thompson is.
"Love talking about form. I've personally changed my form many times throughout high school, depending on which senior I wanted to emulate the most. I hate my left thumb with a passion lol  I think one reason for this trend is that basketball camps for younger kids don't have a block of time focused on form. While the old mentality was ""this is the best form, everyone do this"", the new mentality is ""do whatever you want, just perfect YOUR form"".  This might sound boomer of me, but I'm only 21. When I went to basketball camps in middle school, the first 15-20 minutes every day was dedicated to one hand shots at close range. We would focus on our follow through, high arc, and swishing every shot. BEEF was the way to go. UBC T-Birds camp btw.  The best example in my opinion is pre-NBA Lonzo Ball. No semblance of old-school proper form except maybe his feet alignment. But he kept that form from a young age and developed his own game around his shooting mechanics. That left step back that he was famous for at UCLA? 100% unstoppable because the defender had to go across his body to contest it, and by that point there's a good chance of a foul.  Even Trae Young and other chest-shooters like Lamelo Ball. Release is too low for the old school way of thinking. Right elbow isn't 90° at all. But he developed his step back and quick release to accomodate for his easier-to-block shot.  I think it's changed for the better. We get to see way more innovation in how players move on the court. Sure, there's picture perfect players like Klay Thompson, but the fact that his form is so textbook makes him stand out even more."
Ben Simmons is a better player than Klay Thompson
We are also missing Klay Thompson so that evens out
"My top 5:  Steph  Jason Richardson  Baron Davis  Klay Thompson  Jokic  Honorable mentions: Dame, Ginobili, Kobe, D Rose, Shaq"
"I'd really like the know how efficient he would be if he got regular shots like guys like Joe Harris, JJ Redick or hell even Klay Thompson. The degree of difficulty on his shots is just completely insane and goes against everything we expect from an efficient player."

"&gt; I)  The subtle magic of Stephen Curry  How do you get open when all five defenders are focused on you? We know the common methods. Curry can roast his guy one-on-one, leveraging the threat of the most accurate jumper in league history. He can use a screen from Draymond Green, rumbling into open space more often now with James Wiseman injured -- and the Warriors playing more with Green at center.  Those two make such magic together. What they have is really why we follow basketball. It is what every player searches for, but few find: a hoops soulmate who amplifies your game, sees the floor through your eyes, and reads your intentions the moment you do. Some of their greatest mutual highlights are the product of improvisation -- tweaking some tried-and-true action at the last second because of something only they visualize.  But one of my favorite Steph-isms, on full brilliant display during this incandescent month, is the game of hide-and-seek Curry plays in the chaos of transition.  He seems disinterested, casual. Then he stops and turns his back to the rim. What? Is he setting a back screen? It looks that way. That's not it, though. Curry spies Alex Len loitering near the paint -- far from his man (Kevon Looney). What Curry is really doing is waiting for Looney. Once Looney arrives, Curry slips behind him.  Curry sprints diagonally, and right into Jayson Tatum. As he makes contact, Curry motions for Andrew Wiggins to pop out -- as if that's the plan. Nope. Wiggins cuts to the rim, and both defenders follow him. Green finishes the con job with a glance at Wiggins before shoveling to Curry.  Curry is one of one. The league has never seen this level of on-ball potency and off-ball relentlessness in the same player. Most churning off-ball rovers run around the way they do because they can't do much with the ball. They need to catch it at the right angle, with the right amount of space, to get their shots off. Curry can contort himself into a triple from anywhere, anytime. There are no boundaries to his creativity.  That is so calculated. Curry goes right around that first Green pick. Green is open. The pass is there. But Curry senses that by reversing course, he can drag Davis Bertans a few extra feet from Kent Bazemore -- and craft an easier shot.  Curry probably isn't winning MVP if the Warriors finish around .500, but he has planted himself in the conversation. As of now, I would guess the three names to appear on the most ballots would be Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Curry.  But Curry's magnificent season is more important for what it portends. He has reestablished himself as a first-team All-NBA-level player. He is already something beyond a franchise icon. Golden State owes Curry an honest effort at chasing championships over the next three seasons.  The biggest question in the league -- the one the Warriors must ask themselves each day -- is how close they are with Green, Curry, and Klay Thompson returning from two devastating injuries, and their current supporting cast. The answer depends in part on external variables: Who might rise and fall in the West? But factoring in age-related decline for all three stars and rust for Thompson, the safest assumption is the Warriors need something else to pop.  It might not have to be something huge -- the addition of another star via some megatrade that would involve one or both of Wiseman and the shiny Minnesota Timberwolves pick Golden State owns. It could be internal growth from a couple of key guys, including Wiseman making a huge leap soon.  Regardless: This Curry -- this destroyer -- demands prioritizing the immediate future."
"Yes, but have you considered that he looks sorta like Klay Thompson if you squint?"
malachi is incredibly racially ambiguous somebody help me out here  is he klay thompson lightskin
Jingles is Klay Thompson
"Check out 8/8 in the third by Klay Thompson. Is Steph best of all time? Yes, I even said above that I agree mf go read it. But Klay Thompson has hands down the best performance of all time in that game. Yes he’s inconsistent, ankles made of jelly, but I will die on the hill that no one has played better than Klay Thompson in the third against the kings."
why is Trez calling for the ball on the right wing like he's klay thompson? love you Trez but you're wide open out there for a reason 😂
"""Curry, Durant, Klay Thompson have 83; the Nuggets have 85..""   Our current team is fun to watch, but I miss this time to time."
Gives me hope for klay Thompson.
There’s plenty of players who have hit game winners in the playoffs. Klay Thompson dropped 60 points in 29 minutes.
A 6’10 kyrie is completely broken on offense. That’s basically KD. I’d rather have KD than a taller Klay Thompson.
"They also played in an era with no zone defense. Bulls second best scorer averaged 16ppg in 1995-6. Warrior's second best scorer (whoever he may be) averaged 30ppg on transcendent efficiency. Then Klay is a better scorer than Pippen. Warriors also have Andre Iguodala, David West, and Shaun Livingston to bring off the bench. They easily roll the Bulls in 4, 5 if they're lucky. MJ can GOAT all he likes, he's going to have about as much success as LeBron did, which is to say none at all. Bulls have no answer for Curry, KD, and Thompson whatsoever. There's just too many threats. Rodman is fantastic but the Warriors have prime Draymond. I just don't see how anyone could think otherwise. Two MVPs and all-timers in their absolute primes sharing the court &gt; 1 MJ. And again, they're both more efficient scorers than MJ. None of the big men on the Bulls would be able to stay on the court with Draymond, so you'd basically see Dray and Rodman small ball an entire series, which I'd really like to see, lol."
Steph Curry without his elite handles would be Klay Thompson  Klay Thompson without defense would be Duncan Robinson
"I'm a Heat fan but Butler is not better than Beal imo. In fact you could place a few players ahead of Butler....Trae Young, John Wall, Middleton, Klay Thompson, I think Bam Adebayo is a better asset than Jimmy...Butler can't shoot 3s, but wins when it counts though. It was the team of the Heat that brought them to the finals. Not just Butler."
Ray Allen’s shooting + Kawhi’s defense + new girl every week + Stonehenge’s face + chocolate milk + Zach Lavine’s skin tone = Klay Thompson
"The real super star of the warriors, forget that Steph Curry scrub, forget Kevin ""the Snake"" Durant, forget Draymond ""Triple Single"" Green forget Klay ""Icy Hot"" Thompson"
"I would have to disagree, he’s not miles ahead of everyone in shooting like TB is in football. Klay is a formidable second place and I wouldn’t say Steph is that much better of a shooter than him. I’m not saying Steph is overrated or anything, just that there is a guy named Klay Thompson who in fact exists. People love to exaggerate things to glorify their favorite players. That’s why some people think LeBron is the GOAT although to be fair, that will likely become a reality in like 3-4 years"
Klay Thompson in shambles
"Terrelle Pryor was another athlete who was had crazy accomplishments in both sports. State championships in both sports. First team all American in football, Parade player of the year. Fourth team all American in basketball.  ESPN had him 39th in his recruiting class, 14 spots ahead of Klay Thompson and three spots below Draymond green. And this was with him clearly more focused on football."
"The maximum-impact title (if it fits) would be something like:  ""Six players have multiple games with 10+ threes.  Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, JR Smith, James Harden, and Zach LaVine have 16 combined.  Steph Curry has 17."""
Klay Thompson sitting back like “that’s cute”
Semi “Klay Thompson” Ojeleye
"Google Klay Thompson, Chuckster"
"Yikes, comparing the Point God to Klay Thompson. Now I know you’re off your rocker. Still haven’t used a single stat to back up your argument."
"For example, Klay Thompson shot a higher ts than Paul pierce for most of their careers, so far. I would rather have Paul Peirce because hes a more dominant player who can make more happen. Hes harder to guard. That's how I feel about Rose vs Paul."
"Payton ""steph curry "" Pritchard and semi ""klay Thompson "" ojeleye"
"I’ve agreed multiple times that having a better free throw would help, of course it would.  If Fox or other players in a similar situation hesitate to drive because of their free throw %, then their coaches/psych need to work with them to show that them shooting free throws is as good as Klay Thompson shooting a 3 pointer.  My original comment in this whole thread was that getting to the line was more important than the percentage that the player shoots in general because free throws are so good for all but the worst free throw shooters"
"Some of the comments in the thread OP linked to in r/lakers are just so dumb. If popularity is all that matters then Klay Thompson, Derrick Rose, and Carmelo should all be starting lol"
"Trust us Raptors fans. In 2018 we had the first seed, best bench in the league, and the Cavs, with pretty much no one outside of LeBron and KLove smacked us as the fourth seed. JR Smith turned into Klay Thompson as he always did vs us and Casey made 0 adjustments. Still a lot of differences in this comparison though, and LeBron is LeBron, but you can't put much stock into regular season wins. Not trying to downplay the Jazz by any means, just know it happens 😭"
"That's interesting. My impression has been that he doesn't quite have the lateral quickness. Definitely tuning into that OKC-Portland game a week from now.   I see your point in evaluating on-ball vs. off-ball though the fact that Dort takes on such a variety of tough perimeter assignments likely does hurt his off-ball value. The energy he has to expend and the attention those guys require is significant. Clearly this isn't a deficiency of Dort, just something I thought about while reading your comment.   Not to belabor the point but I see Dort as a Klay Thompson type rather than Smart. He's a reasonably versatile (slightly less than Klay) point of attack defender who  doesn't make many plays in the form of steals and blocks (slightly more than Klay) and only provides moderate off-ball value.   I also looked at his defensive impact metrics and while those are somewhat unreliable I thought it was pretty interesting. RAPTOR has him as a solid positive while RPM thinks he's neutral and LEBRON has him as a significant negative."
Or Klay Thompson when the West is literally stacked at Guard
Klay Thompson is still recovering from injury so he wouldn't help them that much this season.
"He said Igoudala, who by no means is a bad player but is only a 1 time all star and career 33% 3 shooter, should be the one to take an OPEN shot over the two greatest shooters of all time, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, and one of the greatest scorers of all time Kevin Durant. It was a shit take."
"Dude just stop. The gsw had KD former MVP, arguably the best scorer in the nba, 2 time unanimous mvp Curry, Klay Thompson who is the second best shooter in the nba after curry and Draymond... who won defensive player of the year the season before."
So who was it that told me Mike Conley was gonna be an all star? Klay Thompson got more votes than him lmao
Because there’s no reason that Klay Thompson should be on this list and Alex Caruso is an absolute meme.   De’Aaron Fox is having a career year and deserves to be up there.
"1. I STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY DEROZAN IS LISTED AT A GAURD WHEN HE HASN’T PLAYED A SINGLE MINUTE AT GUARD FOR 2 YEARS   2. Spurs fans need to do better. No reason for Alex Caruso, Klay Thompson who hasn’t played in 2 seasons, and CJ who has been out for like a month to be getting more votes than him.   3. Where tf is De’aaron fox"
"It's amazing how I provided an example of a play of Klay Thompson doing exactly that, but you're still willing to say the defender never helps off of him."
Klay Thompson really likes chocolate milk
"Kyrie shot more then Bron *by about a shot*.  Kyrie I s also shooting more than KD. *By about a shot* . Did I say Kyrie was the first option over KD? No. Klay Thompson shot more than KD *by about a shot*. But was still 3rd option.   Harden is shooting **5 shots less than 2 other players**. Clearly there is a big difference. And now not only am I repeating myself, you’re answering questions with questions. Idc how Tobias gets his shots, he’s clearly the 2nd option and you can’t even bring yourself to dispute that. Didn’t address the Cp3-Booker thing either.   One final nail in your premise:  Big 3 Celtics , rondo “ran the team” (your words),  and had all the assists . Did that mean he was 1st, 2nd, or 3rd option ahead of any of the big 3? 🤔😂 Yea you’re in a box now your argument is crushed.  Good day"
I really like Klay Thompson
"Zach ""Klay Thompson"" Lavine"
Did this exercise at work with some buddies of mine.   Klay Thompson  Son of a player so had a good up bringing and not abject poverty. Well liked and respected amongst all his peers. On a great team in a great city. Famous enough where you could probably still be a somewhat normal person (I.e. walking through a mall without a mob). Has had success in his career and has an awesome Bull dog.
Curry has klay Thompson injured .
Man Golden State had fucking Klay Thompson injured for the whole season. Imagine him with the Steph we’re seeing now!  Then we see Ky going on abt “against the odds” crap
This is completely false  The reason KD/Curry weren’t given serious consideration is because they ALSO had Klay Thompson and fucking Draymond Green   That’s four all stars and it’s the same reason why KD/Harden won’t be given serious consideration because they’re also playing with Kyrie.   On the lakers it’s just Lebron and AD and the rest of the team.   I don’t know how y’all are so naive when it comes to this
Really hard to get help when you have a max contract tying your salary cap up for a guy who doesn't play.  Klay Thompson is about as perfect a #2 you can ask for but he's not really replaceable with the $9.3M exception they got for his injury.  Celtics fans should know this struggle after watching Gordon Hayward in street clothes for 3 years.
"Even if he and Gelo join the hornets, or whatever team together, I don't think Lonzo will play freely. Maybe when he's 25-30 we will see more glimpses of that UCLA Lonzo.   I think he got to the league and found out he can't really play halfcourt basketball. I'd say a great number of his mixtapes, highlights of him getting 7 - 11 assists were from fast breaks. Running a halfcourt offense seems foreign to him. That DEEP step back 3 in college, is now a hugging the 3pt line three and everyone knows his step back like everyone knows Andrew wiggins loves the spin move.   Lonzo just doesn't have shot creation skills even though he's taller and longer than just about every starting guard. When he gets by his guy, his layup package is just weak as hell. Gelo, of given the chance the chance to be a Klay Thompson type, would be better in the league than Lonzo long term."
"It's called a dip and it's not as awful as people on here are saying. It's understandable because coaches go crazy over this. It's a rhythm thing. Players who dip before shooting:   * Steph Curry  * Bradley Beal  * JJ Redick * Jayson Tatum * Kevin Durant * Klay Thompson * Fred VanFleet   Should I go on? It doesn't slow the shot down. I don't understand the logic behind why it's bad. You still have to bend your knees and the dip motion happens simultaneously with the lower body. By the time you raise up to shoot, the ball is coming out an the top of the jump."
"Thing is, the system is just one Klay Thompson short of being unstoppable.  They have defense, ball facilitators, and the greatest shooter ever, who only needs a semi-consistent outside shooter as an off-ball threat to pass to.  And Klay is **more** than semi-consistent."
i also wish Furkan Korkmaz would wake up tomorrow with the same game as game 6 Klay Thompson. it's probably time to just focus on what Simmons is. the conversation with him is uniquely unfair. the guy was all-nba and all-defense last year.
Lu Dort has gone from Klay Thompson from 3 to Andre Roberson with a league average 3 pointer  I’ll fucking take it still though  SGA’s improvement may be understated/under-appreciated just cause people don’t pay as much attention to the team. Significantly increasing his role and also increasing his efficiency is an extremely good sign
Klay Thompson is the 2nd best player in the NBA.
yet somehow Klay Thompson has more votes than him
Like Klay Thompson!
I think Klay Thompson is the most overrated defender in the NBA over the last 5 years.
Right now the worst contact in the league is Klay Thompson.
"Your first argument is sound, but I was actually referring to learning the skill of shooting, not winning titles. I'm with you that it would wrong for a boss/coach to do that in your scenario. But here, with the shooting, it's something they've been asking him to do behind the scenes and publicly, albeit gently (Brown saying in an interview he'd like to see Simmons at least attempt a three every game, for instance). Also, your example with Klay is really good too. I can't argue with the concept too much, honestly.  &amp;#x200B;  But really, the issue is that Golden State never asked Klay Thompson to rebound more. If they had, I imagine he'd do it. I can't say he'd be much better at it even if he was trying, but I think he would make the effort. Simmons never even tried. I don't think anyone with the Sixers thinks he's going to get a late-career Jason Kidd jumper, but to not even attempt it is [insubordinate and churlish.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO1oBfG59Xw) And that attitude is really threaded throughout this whole thing.  &amp;#x200B;  I think the real reasons that fuel a lot of the haters (myself included) is the idea that someone could be so talented and just not give a shit is offensive on a few levels, but also the idea of potential that people themselves aren't tapping. Underachievers and the like. I think a lot of that is in Ben Simmons too - the fear of failure, the fear of looking bad at something or foolish, all that stuff that gets lumped in there. People see tiny, lower stakes versions of that in the mirror and it drives them nuts."
https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=what+happened+to+klay+thompson%3F
"Um? Taking this at face value, a simple google for Klay Thompson would yield the result you're looking for.   Returns from injury, particularly back to back, take a while."
"It's like if Tony Parker was built like a brahma bull. Yes, his power and explosiveness plays a major role in his effectiveness, but his touch and footwork are crazy.  You will still see takes that a guy like Zion isn't very skilled and relies mostly on athleticism and size, but you never hear people say Klay Thompson isn't very skilled. Klay is a great shooter, especially catch and shoot scenarios, but his handles, passing, footwork and finishing touch are nowhere near a player like Zion. I guess shooting is viewed as the ultimate skill."
"This is corny, though I did smirk at Travel Coordinator Klay Thompson."
"Durant isn't as ball-dominant as LeBron, he can post up at the 3PT line and still be extremely lethal from that spot like a Klay Thompson type. LeBron isn't a bad shooter but that isn't an effective use of his abilities while Westbrook is initiating the offense."
"The deciding factor will be of course Klay Thompson, and as a basketball fan, I'm rooting for his return. If he is ready to go 100%, GSW NO DOUBT will give the Western teams a run for their money on being 1st place in the regular season."
"Fucking Avery Bradley looking like the second coming of Klay Thompson tonight, unironically."
Klay “ Street Clothes “ Thompson  Cause he’s always in street clothes
Oh my lord you’re gonna add Klay Thompson to this? Insane.
Imagine this team + a Klay Thompson
Can you imagine these guys when they get Klay fucking Thompson back
Imagine if Klay fucking Thompson was out there lmao
They don’t even have klay Thompson lmao lakers are frauds
Klay thompson is playing like such shit he’s invisible out there!
I really wish Klay was healthy. Love me some Klay Thompson.
I feel like most people are just assuming Klay Thompson is still an all star and we should definitely not be assuming that.
Klay “ Street Clothes “ Thompson
The ghost of Klay Thompson
"*Also Klay Thompson:* those guys won a chip in the twilight of their careers. @Wiseman and @Kuminga, no pressure."
Klay Thompson is more of street clothes these days.
"It's insanely unreasonable, because it relies entirely on having peak Klay Thompson and we have no idea what Klay we'll even get when he comes back.  He's my fave, so I hope he's no different. But two years off, ACL tear, achilles tear. These are not good signs."
Or Klay Thompson
"ESPN ""Breaking, Klay Thompson requests trade to Spurs, cites a willingness to play with a retired Tim Duncan."""
Patty Mills doing his best Klay Thompson impersonation
"Speaking for just the 538 model here, and it's that [they're not confident Klay will be back to top form](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-bucks-run-it-back-can-lebron-win-his-fifth-ring-how-our-model-sees-the-2021-22-nba-season/).  It also looks like [Curry has a wider variance](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/stephen-curry/), possibly in part due to the change in the rules for drawing fouls.  &gt; We next have to address the Warriors, who are projected to finish worse than they did last year and miss the play-in tournament entirely. And that’s not because the model isn’t accounting for Klay Thompson playing games. It’s actually the opposite.5 **RAPTOR penalizes players who suffer Achilles tears, as Thompson did prior to last season. Throw in the fact that he was already coming off a torn ACL prior to that, and the model now views him as a net-negative player**. The model views the Warriors, like the Lakers, as being chock-full of negatives, with **only Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Gary Payton II (The Mitten!) grading out as net positives**, among the team’s projected rotation players."
Let's be real. Klay Thompson got white boy shooters paid
"'Klay Thompson returns to average 20 on 60.3% TS.'  Subscribe  'The Warriors get destroyed, as Steph shoots 18% from three in the series. I'm sure the post game thread will be merciful.'  Unsubscribe.  For real though, nice simulation, shoutouts to /u/dumbmatter as always."
&gt; Klay Thompson returns to average 20 on 60.3% TS.  🥲
"You’re on crack If you’re about to compare Ray Allen to Terry Rozier! Christ, this is dumb. Ray Allen has led a bunch of teams far in the playoffs as the number one stop saying 10th seed crap, like that was all the time. You have no clue what the hell you are even talking about and you are so far off with your assessment on Ray Allen it’s honestly comical. Klay Thompson can’t be the number one because he can’t even create his own shot. He wouldn’t put up numbers like Ray Allen did if he was the number one option because he is not capable of doing it. He is a catch and shoot player that benefits with playing with Steph Curry. Ray Allen lead the Milwaukee bucks to the Eastern conference finals is the number one one game away from making the NBA finals, And he also lied a broken Seattle team before you got there far into the playoffs. I have no idea what you were talking about. He was seriously looked at as the best shooter of all time before Stephen Curry came along and that is why he is more comparable to Steph Curry then he is Klay Thompson. Klay Thompson can’t even get a shot off without his teammates helping. He’s a great shooter but he’s not comparable to Ray he’s more comparable to old Ray Allen because that’s what really old round turn this game into, but prime Ray Allen, hell no, that’s the dumbest take I have ever heard. Like I said you clearly have no idea what you were talking about and just saying dumb shit"
Calling Ayton a high end role player is like calling Klay Thompson a 3&amp;D guy who should go for around 20 million a season.
"Lemme guess. Curry has another MVP season, Jordan Poole becomes an All-Star, James Wiseman undergoes incredible development, Klay Thompson is better than what he was 2 years ago, Draymond in DPOY form, Iggy 2015 Finals MVP form, Kuminga and Moody start contributing as soon as they touch the court. Warriors are the best amirite?"
i just did the math and klay thompson has been out longer than all these players combined. lakers in 4 pussy!
"you absolutely haven't dude lol. Ben Simmons DOES score more efficiently than Klay Thompson. We can just use context to explain that Ben is finishing easy possessions and scoring at the rim. It doesn't mean he is a better shooter, nobody is saying Deandre Jordan is a better shooter than Steve Nash but his FG% is way better."
"Seriously. Rip Hamilton would be a better version of Klay Thompson. Rasheed Wallace would be a better version of KAT. Ben Wallace Would be a better version of Draymond Green. Chauncey Billups would be a better version of James Harden. Tayshaun Prince would be a better version of Ben Simmons. Don’t forget they beat a team of Kobe, Shaq, Karl Malone, and Gary Payton all in their primes."
"Klay is a more versatile player that more teams would want, but Draymond easily contributes to winning more than Thompson does. Him+Curry was +22/100 2016-2019 without KD."
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
5% for our new Klay Thompson.
You should be more worried about your own team:  * Steph Curry has missed 115 games in the last five years due to various injuries  * Klay Thompson has missed each of the last two years and won't be back until December or January  * Wiseman missed half of last season and is at least going to miss the first couple months of this season with an injury  * Otto Porter Jr. has missed 120 games over the last three seasons with injuries  * Kevon Looney has missed 56 games in the last two years with injuries  * Andre Iguodala is older than anyone on the Lakers (which is saying something)  * Draymond Green has missed 47 games over the last 3 years with injuries
Bullshit. His On/Off was +15.3 this post season. It's the other Jazz members who aren't championships caliber players. Without Gobert they probably don't even make the playoffs.  If you put Gobert on the Warriors they are instantly the best team in the NBA even without Klay Thompson.
"Well then I guess John Stockton is a scrub, same with Klay Thompson, and Chris Paul. Just because a guy has little to no playoff success as his team’s first option doesn’t mean he has a bad playoff resume."
Klay Thompson averaged 22.3 ppg one season. He could’ve probably averaged 25 if KD didn’t show up
"Klay Thompson. But I agree Ayton doesn't deserve it, he can't shoot like Klay."
"&gt;Curry would check in periodically, texting a variation of, “Keep your head up. You know this is not what we’re used to,” and, “It’s not going to be like this for long,” after losses. Thompson would tease, “Oh, you have to go through this? Ha!”   LMAO, Klay is funny 😂😂"
TS% doesn't matter as much as you want it to.   TS% says Simmoms is a better shooter than Klay Thompson
"I’m not comparing him to the rest of the league though, such as big men, I’m comparing him to SGs as his contributions to Boston can be compared with other guard’s contributions to their teams.  He’s the 10th highest paid SG, 26th highest paid Guard going into 2021-22 and performing with the aforementioned stats. He’s paid accurately, not overpaid, not underpaid. Only guards that are making more than him and aren’t better are De’Aaron Fox ($28M), D’Angelo Russell ($30M), CJ McCollum ($30.8M), Ben Simmons ($33M), John Wall ($44.3M) - those guys are probably overpaid, even if it is slightly. Maybe throw Klay Thompson ($37.9M) because we haven’t seen him in 2 years, and Westbrook at $44.2M. I wouldn’t say he should be paid at their levels because those guys are overpaid, hence Brown is paid accurately for his contributions."
"He found his niche in the NBA and slowly improves on it. Yea he is no klay thompson, but his energy and effort on the floor is contagious. Almost everygame hes in he has a big play. Whether its a steal, a block, a dunk etc."
"&gt; Year over year the 2019/2020 Golden State Warriors basically lost Steph Curry, Kevin Durrant and Klay Thompson.  Even beyond the big 3, they essentially lost their entire team: Iguodala, Jerebko, Cook, McKinnie, Livingston, Bell, Cousins, Jones, and Bogut.  Draymond was the only guy who played 400+ minutes for the Warriors in both 2019 and 2020. Damion Lee and Looney were the only other players to play 200+ minutes both years."
"Year over year the 2019/2020 Golden State Warriors basically lost Steph Curry, Kevin Durrant and Klay Thompson.  Draymond’s production went to crap as well as he stopped having those guys to play with.  Talk about the biggest year over year collapse as they went from the 2nd best team to the worst.  Terrible for morale for sure."
"Three takeaways from your banned post:  Klay: now I'm interested in how you get Thompson. Is it an euphonic for Tom's son? Harden: he does get harder, just not in the gym Steph: come on, you can't deny he's spicy."
"Tony Parker - has parked a car before  Klay Thompson - a Thompson sub machine gun is a gun that shoots. Klay also shoots.   Bill Walton - has payed bills before  Fat Lever - has a fat lever, if you catch my drift  Gregg Popovich - goes by Pop, is a dad which is another word for pop  Idk I tried..."
"On Bill Simmon's podcast, Malcolm Gladwell's all-time draft for Team Nigeria:   * Giannis  * Embiid * Steve Nash * Igoudala * Patrick Ewing * Hakeem  * Tim Duncan * Victor Oladipo * Klay Thompson"
Klay Thompson would be a Hufflepuff prefect for sure.  Jaylen Brown - Ravenclaw  Chris Paul - Slytherin  Kemba Walker - Gryffindor
"Yeah, I remembered that...  Everyone in grantland was saying: Can you imagine not trading for Kevin Love, just so you can pay fucking Klay Thompson the max down the road?  And I was like: that does sound pretty stupid if Bill puts it like that."
"PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: OG Anunoby  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo/Anthony Davis  C: Anthony Davis/Giannis Antetokounmpo   Bench: Ben Simmons, Brook Lopez, Klay Thompson(obviously expecting him to be the player he once was)  Size, Switching, Secondary options if AD gets hurt and none of these guys are liabilities from the line in close games besides Simmons so I don't have to take them out. Should be the best team in the NBA."
"Starks wasn't the most efficient shooter, but he shot crazy high volume for his era in some of those seasons. The first shortened line year, he shot 7.6 a game, which led the league, and is as many as Klay Thompson took in 2019"
"1st pick will probably still be MJ. However, assuming all 30 teams are drafting in a snake draft, the top fifteen picks will not necessarily be the best players, but a scramble for the greatest bigs that can slow down Lakers Shaq. Magic, Bird, even Lebron can slide down to later picks in favor of Kareem, Wilt, Russell, Hakeem, even Walton or Mikan.  Assuming I'm picking in the 15-20 range, I'll build around Curry.  PG Steph Curry (1st pick)   SG/SF Drazen Petrovic (5th pick)  SG/SF Klay Thompson (4th pick)  PF/C Chris Bosh (3rd pick)  PF/C Wes Unseld (2nd pick)"
"People forget the core 3 warriors with a bunch of scrubs  last time they played  together defeated stacked Rockets, swept Portland, and with a hobbled klay Thompson(missed 1 home game) they took Raptors to game 6 and it all came down to the last shot, that raptors team is better than any team out there, with improved cast and klay coming back they are going to run through the league- book it 67 wins and finals appearance."
Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson
If he can stay healthy and work on his fouling problems he’s basically Siakam but 6’11 and with Klay Thompson shooting
1. LeBron James ($111.2 million) 2. Stephen Curry ($92.8 million) 3. Kevin Durant ($87.9 million) 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo ($80.3 million) 5. Russell Westbrook ($74.2 million) 6. James Harden ($62.3 million) 7. Damian Lillard ($56.3 million) 8. Klay Thompson ($54 million) 9. Paul George ($47.8 million) 10. Jimmy Butler ($47 million)
"The whole NBA didn't just change their defensive scheme...they also changed their offensive schema  Long story short   Curry creates nearly infinite space in the paint because if his near 50% 3pt percentage (he actually shoots better from 30 feet from the basket than most players do 10 to 12 feet out).   So defensives have to stretch to cover him or double him (he is in 3pt range once he crosses the half point line and that really isn't an exaggeration)  So between him and then fucking Klay Thompson there can really be only one to three players in the paint since most GSW warriors are respectable 3 point shooters.   So this creates room in the paint for drives (for example, the video) so defensives collapse, then curry has a choice to finish or pass out for a high percentage 3 pointer shot (you will always notice one to two GSW players on the 3 pt line with hands up)   So the league is a copy cat league, so this proven, basic offensive scheme won multiple chips so everyone started chucking deep 3 pointers and so now you have players like dame, Trae young, Luka bombing deep 3s but no one is as consistent as curry."
"Here's my list, including bubble players  Should be guaranteed (retirees listed first)  * Tim Duncan * Kobe Bryant * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Dwyane Wade * Steve Nash * Jason Kidd * Allen Iverson * Paul Pierce * Ray Allen * Gary Payton * LeBron James * Kevin Durant * Steph Curry * Chris Paul * James Harden  Would be surprised if they didn't make it  * Giannis Antetokounmpo (not in the highest tier only because of age) * Kawhi Leonard * Dwight Howard * Russell Westbrook  I think should make it  * Dominique Wilkins * Reggie Miller * Dennis Rodman * Bob McAdoo  Youngest active player to consider  * Nikola Jokic (in the league for 6 seasons and has an MVP. Shaq only was in the league for 4 seasons before the top 50 list)  My Bubble  * Tracy McGrady * Vince Carter * Pau Gasol * Tony Parker * Dikembe Mutombo * Anthony Davis * Chris Bosh * Manu Ginobili * Chris Mullin * Chauncey Billups * Ben Wallace * Adrian Dantley * Alex English * Carmelo Anthony  Reggie Miller Group (active veteran players not good enough for this anniversary list, but might be good enough in 25 years after a full career)  * Damian Lillard * Draymond Green * Kyle Lowry * Paul George * Jimmy Butler * Klay Thompson"
Sticking with Klay Thompson instead of trading him for Kevin Love.
"**Some modern ones:**  * Jerry West convincing the Warriors NOT to trade Klay Thompson for Kevin Love.  He really didn't like Love's lack of defense * Hornets letting Kemba walk instead of offering him a max contract, not trading for Westbrook, and drafting Lamelo might prove to be a genius move * The Clippers trading Blake Griffin super early into his contract * Trading the #1 pick and presumptive first overall pick Markelle Fultz for the 3rd pick and Jayson Tatum"
"Exactly this. The problem is that the role Klay had and the role Middleton had are just not the same, and so people are comparing the ability of Klay to deliver on his role (3&amp;D, of which he is surely indisputably one of the best ever) and the ability of Middleton to deliver on his role (primary outside scoring option and second scoring option generally - primary in the closing minutes, playmaker) and coming away - fairly - with the idea that Klay is better at his role than Middleton is at his. But these are not equal demands on a players offensive capabilities. Middleton/Giannis PnR with the ball starting in Middleton's hands is one of the best offensive plays that exists in the league today; that is not happening to that level with Klay instead.  I think there's a very clear case for Middleton is a better scorer, because if you strip away everything Middleton is putting the ball through the same number of times that Klay did, but with fewer attempts. He requires less from his team to do this, and is far more versatile. If in this year's playoffs the Bucks offense in the closing minutes involved Klay Thompson, instead of Middleton, starting the offense the ball in his hands and being told to create points, I'm not convinced it would lead to a championship."
"Depends on the team structure, Middleton is better for the Bucks than Klay would be but Klay is better for the Warriors than Khris would be. Khris has shot creating abilities that Klay doesn’t have while Klay is one of the best catch and shoot 3 point shooters of all time but isn’t as great at creating his own shots. Middleton is also craftier in the midrange imo. Thompson has the edge on defense (unless he’s declined significantly). It’s really about personal preference and fit"
"Klay Thompson game 6 of the 2015 finals:  5 pts on 2-7 shooting, somehow becomes a meme instead of an indictment of his performance. In fact across the Warriors 3 consecutive wins to close out that series he averaged 9/3/2 on sub 45% TS.   Klay Thompson game 7 of 2016 finals: 14/2/2  Klay Thompson the entire 2017 playoffs: 15/4/2 on 51% TS.   Klay has 100% shown up in a lot of big games with some awesome performances but when he disappears he’s Teflon. When the Warriors swept the blazers in the 2019 WCF he had 86 points on 87 shots against a Dame/CJ backcourt. The Warriors were down by 17 3 times, had Steph and to a lesser extent Draymond not gone crazy that performance would not have gotten it done."
i have. game 6 2016 WCF. Klay Thompson was NOT in that building
"I like it when Steph Curry does it because that playstyle is efficient for him.  But there are now too many wannabe Steph Curry's who chuck too many three's. Like Dame Lillard, James Harden, Trae Young. They take way too many three point shots. They try to imitate Steph Curry, but to be honest their three point shot isn't good enough to justify the amount of three's they take. Steph Curry, on the other hand, is justified to take that many three's because how efficient he is at them.  TLDR: Steph Curry and Klay Thompson should be the only ones who attempt that many three's. Everyone else is not good enough at the three to justify taking so many three point attempts."
"...but that's for currently injured players. And on top of that, the minutes given don't really match the attitude of the article.  'And that’s not because the model isn’t accounting for Klay Thompson playing games. It’s actually the opposite.'  The model assumes Klay will play ~14 minutes for the year starting from Dec 25th. It assumes Lowry will play 10mpg during the 2023-2024 season."
&gt; they were a horrible match up ~~for the 6ers~~ for everyone except Klay fuckin Thompson defensively
"538 does a lot of good work, but they are horrible when it comes to sports.  So often in their modeling they overlook important variables.  So the Warriors are going to be WORSE than last year?  If your model projects Klay Thompson to be a net negative player, well, you might want to make some tweaks to it."
"Anyone else: ""Klay Thompson entered the league 10 years ago""  [Bill Simmons: ""This is Klay Thompson's *second decade*""](https://youtu.be/GkhHjuXwHqw?t=864)"
"Lmfao why the fuck do people parrot this stupid shite? That was a second round series.   They were a shot away from going to overtime against a better team, first of all. Second of all, I love how people just assume that they would’ve beaten the Bucks. Thirdly, if Klay Thompson was healthy for the Warriors series (no guarantee he would’ve gotten injured in that hypothetical series) then Philadelphia still loses."
"Bruh they give an entire paragraph explaining why, what the hell are you talking about?  &gt;We next have to address the Warriors, who are projected to finish worse than they did last year and miss the play-in tournament entirely. And that’s not because the model isn’t accounting for Klay Thompson playing games. It’s actually the opposite.5 RAPTOR penalizes players who suffer Achilles tears, as Thompson did prior to last season. Throw in the fact that he was already coming off a torn ACL prior to that, and the model now views him as a net-negative player. The model views the Warriors, like the Lakers, as being chock-full of negatives, with only Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Gary Payton II (The Mitten!) grading out as net positives, among the team’s projected rotation players.  Nope, not a single mention of why!!!  I just don't understand someone like you who is too lazy to read an article but is still willing to spend time writing out some objectively wrong stupid shit and pressing save."
"I too, love Klay Thompson, and his amazing boat."
Klay Thompson is a perfect fit on any squad and Steph Curry is fucking Steph Curry. Their price tag would make the Celtics - Nets trade look like chump change.
"Klay thompson on literally any team. Everyone is looking for a 3 and D guy, and he’s the SS tier of 3 and D when healthy."
Klay Thompson is my favorite basketball player
"Hey, everyone knows what Finland is but who knows Klay Thompson? Probably some people in this sub. But surely very rare to know that person in Finland."
"5 all star selections the fun spot with a variety of career trajectories  Made it: Reggie Miller, Pistol Pete, Sam Jones, Bob McAdoo, David Thompson  Probably will make it: Tim Hardaway, Chauncey Billups, Chris Webber  Players still very likely to get more selections: Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler  Not making it: John Wall, Al Horford, Rudy LaRusso  Third options on important teams: Klay Thompson, Kevin Love  and several 60s/ABA guys"
"I just can’t think of another player on his level(note, not hating, he’s a great basketball player with an all time handle, no hate on that front) ever you could really say that about. Klay thompson with the Steph and KD warriors?"
"Other reply sums up my thought. Although I will add that while we are not in “win now mode” as you put it, we’re also not in tank mode. Jackson is the “take a swing” while Duarte fits the immediate needs of a team trying to still be competitive.  Also, who knows, Duarte could be a Klay Thompson in the making. If following the NBA for a while has taught me anything is that people are actually really bad at assessing talent and potential, particularly outside the top 4-5 in the draft class"
"The year he lost out by a vote that went to D-Wade and D-Wade and his wife made a video about how that person should have voted for Klay Thompson.  Feel free to claim you know more about basketball than Dwyane Wade though if you want to argue he didn't, since it will absolutely make my point that the system is fucking stupid if even D-Wade isn't qualified to tell who should be there."
Is Klay Thompson a smart man?
"Murray should be back by the ASB, he is an incredibly hard worker and I am confident he'll be really good again by the playoffs.  MPJ/Jokic/Gordon plus our other guys should definitely be enough to get us into the playoffs, and we basically have all 4 of our core 4 guys locked up for the next 4 years.  So it isn't a big deal if we compete during the regular season this year, and this move would likely hurt us long term.    MPJ is a very different player than Murray also, I think MPJ is more like a Klay Thompson, where Murray is more like a Steph Curry (not saying he is a good as Curry, just talking about style).  Murray can create his own shot MUCH better than MPJ, and in the playoffs we need someone who can do that.  Simmons obviously wouldn't help there.  While he might be a good fit with Jokic in a vacuum, he wouldn't fit with Gordon, who we just paid.  There really isn't a logical reason for us to do this."
You'll never find him in lists of best looking jumpshots but watching highlights you see just how consistent his form was. As much so as Klay Thompson or Ray Allen
Rick and Brent Barry would qualify; so would Arvydas and Domantas Sabonis. They’re probably the best father son duo actually.  Jimmy Walker and Jalen rose are another but they didn’t have a relationship   Dell Curry was a good player and obviously steph is steph  Larry nance Jr is HOF caliber and Larry Nance Jr is a damn good player  Mychal Thompson was the first overall pick and had a good career and Klay is Klay.    Gary Trent and Gary Trent Jr were/are both good players
Klay Thompson is every NBA fan's second favorite player.  What a legend.
We must protect Klay Thompson at all costs
Klay Thompson is a very interesting character lol
Klay Thompson is one of a kind.
&gt; he might not ever reach All-NBA status  And it might not be because he doesn't deserve it. All-NBA selections are fucked some years. See: Klay Thompson.

"Jrue or Simmons.  In principle, I could see someone like Klay Thompson, though I don't really think he'll elevate his game enough. Andrew Wiggins, who's a 3 who could easily be a 2, he could win if he elevated his game a bit. He had a lot of blocks last season for a wing."

"Those were horrible mechanics. Klay Thompson has the best mechanics and they are true to what is taught for 50 + years. The others you mention have gained consistency, but that is not what you would teach someone learning...you teach the proper way so that they build consistency with the proper mechanics. You are confused with the idea of consistent form and fundamental form."
Klay Thompson- Ray Allen?
Klay Thompson is a better player than Steph and the only reason Steph has more success is because he has the ball in his hands more    Twitter
Klay Thompson is probably riding around in his boat in the SF bay wearing his 3 rings.
"Another what if is if the Warriors lost game 5 in 2019, you just assume that Klay wouldn't have torn his ACL, then you have to also assume that Klay wouldn't have injured his Achilles tendon. The Warriors would still have a prime Klay Thompson nuking teams."
"No it does not , look harder.  Only very very few shoot like that .  Even Klay Thompson stands turned to the basket and has a dip , things classic fundamentals tell to avoid ."
Also Barkley haha. He told Klay Thompson after the his injury that jump shooting teams aren’t going to make it in the league.      I think he was just annoyed with Morey Ball.
"It's not so much the guards that need to break through so much that journalists and panelists don't pay attention to anything but box scores. I've seen a lot of stellar effort from guards, even in this hum-drum era over the last few years. No one pays attention to how perimeter defenders shuffle their opposite number in ISO for the front-court to take credit from all the effort, for example, and they give the Center/Forward the kudos for essentially signing off on an assignment where they do 30 percent of the work to the guard's 70.  I mean, I don't mind Gobert winning the award, really, but he's pretty much the poster boy for just how and why defensive Guards end up being underappreciated, because outside of leaking into pass lanes for the odd steal, there's not really as much of a showcase in regards to how the back court steers the offense into positions for their teammates to exploit.  I think the last Guard anyone *really* paid any attention to in regards to this was Klay Thompson."
Any big Klay Thompson game
1a. Steph Curry  1b. Chris Mullin  3. Klay Thompson  4. Tim Hardaway  5. Shawn Kemp.

The same Andre Roberson who made Ben Wallace seem like Klay Thompson on offense.
"Klay Thompson, but not a cheat code.  I have the cleanest stroke ever, and i play defense like there's no tommorow.  Bonus is that i can pass the ball when i'm not in the corner waiting for the ball to shoot."

"If ""only"" scoring 21 points is such a big flaw you can find in multiple playoff series in multiple years, you need to readjust your perspective. Giannis went 22.7 points, 13.5 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.2 steals, and 2.7 blocks per game that series. Ya I think the fact that Bledsoe scored 10.2 points a game or that Khris Middleton scored 13.7 points a game is a much bigger reason they lost that series. Klay Thompson alone scored more points per game than bot Bledsoe and Middleton combined vs the series vs OKC and if they didn't have Klay Thompson, the Thunder would have won. BTW, Curry is maybe the best scorer of all time and even he had a game that series that he scored ""only"" 19 points."
"And wait, Klay Thompson, a probable hall of famer, isn't superstar level? Tell me you haven't been a basketball fan long without saying you haven't been a basketball fan long."
Klay Thompson because I’ve never seen him dribble.
"I don't really see a much (good) case for Klay Thompson over Alonzo Mourning, Tracy McGrady, Reggie Miller, Damian Lillard, Ben Wallace, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili. Especially over Mourning and McGrady who were borderline MVP level players with decent enough prime durations (looking at Rose here, lol).      Other than that, pretty solid list."
*Klay Thompson likes this.*
"I don’t think players who were eligible and had played the bulk of their careers the last time should be added.

"We r talking about 2010-2017 he played with prime kyrie, love was solid not a good third option like a klay thompson. Bosh and love were on terrible teams and were high volume players everything revolved around them. They were all star caliber. But bosh or love werent the same players as they were on their former teams. Bish was good but he started to have injury problems dude had like 6 knee braces on lol wade also was not in his prime the entire time they were together at best in 2011 he was still very good but he started to noticeably decline every year after and was becoming more and more injury prone. But yes 2017 kyrie and 2011 wade were studs still and love and bosh were still very good. More so bosh..steph kd teams were all in their actual primes at time and meshed together better in you factor in role players and bench it wouldnt b very close at all."
"Shooting guard shoots ball, perfect example Klay Thompson"
Klay Thompson
"Klay Thompson. While he’s not that highest tier of superstar, always being the complimentary star, he’s never shot less than 40% from 3 and until the injuries was a serious iron man for the warriors."
"Most overrated quote of all time. We all know who Kevin Durant is: a completely unguardable scorer who was spoon fed wide open shots for three years because he wanted to play with Steph Curry and Klay Thompson. I'm sorry KD, you're an amazing player, but I'm not impressed by your revenge tour after blowing a 31-point lead to Lou Will and Pat Bev. You were on the fucking Warriors, and you manhandled a team with 0 All-Stars that wasn't supposed to make the playoffs. Sick."
"Those are the greatest players at each position but to describe the position I think it would be better to list players like Stockton, Klay Thompson, Paul Pierce, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing"
"&gt;Additionally, Curry did not account for all that many wins in the years Durant was there, since that team wins a bunch of games regardless of whether any one of Durant/Curry/Thompson are missing from the roster.  The win-pace when Durant was injured (which was virtually identical) and Currys on/off those seasons would tell a significantly different story there.   Like I agree that pairing Durant with players as good as Dray and Klay is a championship-calibre roster given how transcendently good Durant is, but that Warriors team minus Durant was still torching people, and it was largely due to Curry."
Klay Thompson? Do mixed people count if their skin is still white?
"&gt; That core included a fully healthy Klay Thompson that wasn't 31 years old and a Draymond Green that hadn't significantly declined and is also 31 years old.  &gt; They aren't the same players outside of Steph.  31 years old, just ancient."
&gt; Except this Warriors core has actually won 73 games before.  That core included a fully healthy Klay Thompson that wasn't 31 years old and  a Draymond Green that hadn't significantly declined and is also 31 years old.  They aren't the same players outside of Steph.
"Klay Thompson ! Haha naw Kevin love , Gordon Haywood, Duncan Robinson, and Tyler Herro.  Prob going with Duncan Robinson for my 2022 pick"
Harrison Barnes. DeMar DeRozan. Bobby Portis. PJ Tucker. Eric Gordon. Rondo. Honestly Klay Thompson. Draymond. Morant. Kevin Huerter. Cameron Payne.
"Man wtf is this? Is August Klay Thompson awareness month?  If its not an some puff piece about how ""hysterical and charming"" he is, then it's stuff like this claiming he'll add 20 wins to any team."
"Steph,Klay, and Draymond were the 7th,11th, 35th picks in the draft. GSW front office acquired KD in free agency. Cavs front office acquired Lebron in free agency. Along with a 1 pick (Kyrie), another 1 pick(Bennett), another 1 pick(Wiggins/Love), and whatever high number pick Tristan Thompson was. The Cavs clearly were the ones in position to build a superior team"
"I don’t care what anyone says, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green was a superteam. The only reason people act like they’re not is because the KD team is wayyy better in comparison but having the clear two best shooters of all time and one of the greatest defenders ever was so unfair. And they’re still together. Man I hope Klay looks at least a little close to 100%."

"That's sort of a bizzare hypothetical given that no player gives close to a 100% chance of a title, and teams can't sign a player for 10 years.   Saying would you rather have a MVP candidate player (~%20) for a year or 3-4 years of like Klay Thompson is a more realistic comparison."

"Such a weird beef.   LeBron: Draymond called me a bad word, and I didn't like it:  &gt; “I’m all cool with the competition. I’m all fine with that, but some of the words that came out of his mouth was a little bit overboard, and being a guy with pride, a guy with three kids and a family, things of that nature, some things just go overboard and that’s where he took it, and that was it.”  Klay: People talk trash a lot, but I guess what Draymond said hurt his feelings:  &gt; ""Guys talk trash in this league all the time,"" Thompson said. ""I'm just kind of shocked some guys take it so personal. You know, it's a man's league and I've heard a lot of bad things on that court, but at the end of the day, it stays on the court. We're all competitive people. Trash talk is a part of the game in basketball. I feel like it's a part of any sport, especially this competitive."" &gt;  &gt; A reporter then asked Thompson directly if he thought James overreacted. &gt;  &gt; ""I don't know,"" Thompson said. ""I don't know how the man feels. But obviously people have feelings and people's feelings get hurt even if they're called a bad word. I guess his feelings just got hurt. I mean, we've all been called plenty of bad words on the basketball court before. Some guys just react to it differently. All I can say, for myself individually, I just try to ignore it or just let it fuel the fire, but I don't carry it with me when the job is done."""
"&gt;Thompson ehh... he never did develop the handle to operate as an independent scorer. But then again he’s one of the best 3pt shooters of all time and an elite defender.  There were legitimate arguments if Harden / Butler / Klay was the top SG after Kobe and Wade had aged out.  Although, this article seem to think it was between Harden / Wiggins / Klay.

"   1. Anthony Davis. Pretty close, AD has been a solid top 10 player for a few years now.    2. Andrew Wiggins. One of the only ones where there's no injury excuse for why the player isn't as good as predicted.    3. DeMarcus Cousins. DeMarcus could be here if it wasnt for his injuries.    4. Kevin Durant. Pretty good Guess, they probably taught KD would have regressed a bit by now, which he hasn't, since he's almost consensus top 2 player right now.    5. Russell Westbrook. Wrong, but not that insane, I guess Russ would be in the 20-30 range.    6. Kyrie Irving. Pretty close, since he's considered about top 10 right, would be higher if he wasn't injured all the time.    7. Blake Griffin. Way off because of injuries.    8. Stephen Curry. Pretty close,    9. Paul George. Also really close, actually this might be spot on in my eyes.    10. James Harden. Pretty close.    11. Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kind of close.    12. Klay Thompson. I would say spot on if we assume Klay is as good as the last time we saw him.    13. Karl-Anthony Towns. Honestly, for me this is right where Kat belongs, except he's on Timberwolves. I know some people rank him like top25 which is insane to me.    14. Andre Drummond. Way off.    15. Bradley Beal. Really good guess.    16. John Wall. Could be correct if not for the injuries.    17. DeAndre Jordan. Way off    18. Jahlil Okafor. Way off.    19. Dragan Bender. Lol.    20. Jaylen Brown. Spot on Id say.      So to summarise,   Incorrect because of injuries - Demarcus, Blake, John Wall.   Spot on - KD, PG13, Klay, Kat, Bradley, Jaylen Brown.   Way off with no injury excuse - Wiggins, maybe Westbrook?, Drummond, Jordan, Okafor, Bender.   ​"

Where's your Oubre that the team pays hundreds of millions in luxury tax to trade for just to replace the injured Klay Thompson who also, wait for it, tore an achilles."
Jordan Poole. Basically Curry with more fast twitch muscles. Or a Klay Thompson with better handles.

Curry legit has an 11point 5 turnover game in the finals while having a bunch of hall of famers as his safety net.  They still won that game by 15.  He also has a 6-19 game in a close out game 6 in the finals in 2019 where he scored 10 points less than an injured Klay Thompson in ten more minutes and went 1-6 in the fourth quarter.  And those are just the most important games.

Kawhi took Lowry and Siakam as his two best players to win a championship.  And for the defensive competition aspect, go take a look at 2019. Kawhi averaged 30.5 ppg on 49/38/88 shooting splits while going up against defenders such as: Aaron Gordon, Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokuompo, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala.  I'll wait for you to let me know when KD has ever faced that many elite defenders in one playoff run.  Also, I remember when KD was going crazy vs the Pat Beverly Clippers, people didn't seem to care about how shitty the defenders he was playing."
"Klay Thompson, actually Air Bud in human form"
"Klay Thompson is fucking great. Idk if anyone doesn't like him, but if they do I don't know how"
That middle aged white couple on a date were hundy planning to go home until Klay fuckin Thompson invited them to party
"There's lots of examples of a good team stomping on bad teams. I would offer up a situation of a stacked team stomping another stacked team:  [Lakers vs Spurs in the 2001 WCF](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2001-nba-western-conference-finals-lakers-vs-spurs.html)  * 4-0 Sweep by the Lakers against the Spurs who had the Best Record in the NBA that year. * The Lakers posted an ORtg of 115.1 against the #1 Drtg (98.0) in the league. * The Lakers held the Spurs to a woeful Ortg of just 90.4 compared to their regular season ORtg of 106.6 * Average margin of victory was 22.2 pts.  This series was HEAVILY hyped at the time since it was the defending champion Lakers trying for a perfect post-season run against the Spurs with the best record in the NBA in the WCF. With multiple future hall of famers and top-tier coaches on both sides, and it was expected to be an all-time competitive series. No one could have expected the utter domination that unfolded.  [Game 1](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200105190SAS.html) saw Kobe going supernova with an all-time playoff performance dropping 45/10/3 and stealing HCA.  [Game 2](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200105210SAS.html) was the only competitive game with the Lakers overcoming a 40/15 effort from Duncan. The Lakers put the clamps on the rest of the Spurs who laid enough bricks to rebuild the Alamo.  [Game 3](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200105250LAL.html) was a complete humiliation as Shaq &amp; Kobe combined for 71 points compared to the Spurs who scored just 72 as a team in a 39 point beatdown.  [Game 4](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200105270LAL.html) was another 29 point rout. Derek Fisher put on his best Klay Thompson impression and was actually the leading scorer in this game. Duncan looked utterly shell-shocked and attempted just 10 shots while the Spurs basically threw in the towel midway through the 2nd Quarter.  Across the series:  * Kobe played perhaps his greatest playoff series ever, averaging 33 / 7 / 7 / 1.5 / 0.8 * Shaq averaged his usual 27 / 13 / 2.5 / 0.8 / 1.3 against the Twin Towers. * Fisher averaged 17.5 pts and shot 75% from 3's for the series. This is still the record for the best 3 pt percentage in a 7 game series (min attempts?).  It's rare to see a championship caliber team utterly dominated in such a fashion."
"Lmao I was trying to give Curry a break. This is hysterical, so much for trying to be fair.  Curry averaged 43% from the floor and 35% from 3 that series. Curry blew that one too. Even without KD and Thompson GSW still had comparable talent and Kawhi outplayed Curry. With Thompson GSW should have smacked a weak Toronto team, yet they are down. And Curry went 6-17 in the deciding game and 3-11 from 3.   The reason they were as you say a “jumper away” was because Klay gave them a better game in his 30 than Curry did playing 40.  Curry went 1-6 in the final quarter without him and 0-4 from 3, and choked the game away once again.  In regards to 2015. Yes you would generally consider when you have 3 hall of famers including the reigning mvp. and an exceptional all star caliber player you would be able to beat a team without their second and third best player.   I laughed at your prison line. So there is that. Are you in prison? Is that why you go there constantly?"
Why is it klay Thompson day
I am not a Golden State fan but I've always enjoyed watching Klay Thompson play and this will make me want to watch him even more. He's a young man who makes millions of dollars but after winning a championship did not think he was too good or that it was a waste of his time to go hang out with two young fans and for that big props go out to Klay Thompson and I hope when you come back this year you come back with a roar except when you play the Heat take it easy on us would you please lol
"First team all likable:  Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Klay Thompson, Giannis, Nikola Jokic"
"I really tried to break it down too, I feel like that era of warriors is a FUCKING FANTASTIC way to get into enjoying NBA ball, but thats gonna be hard to do if anytime you see Klay Thompson (like the funniest NBA player) you think ""selfish asshole"". ""Boy why is the Steph guy shooting so much I thought he was supposed to be the point guard, what a dick!"""
"Look this is not what I got into the basketball business  to be doing, to be a klay thompson shot getter. I’m a shooter"
"Someone needs to get Klay Thompson to hold Clay Klay Thompson holding a Clay Thompson, then this will be complete"
"Game 6 - KD had the worst game of his playoff career, Russ had the worst game of his playoff career and Klay Thompson had the best game of his playoff career. All three things needed to happen together for OKC to lose this game."
at this point im basically of the opinion that klay thompson is just mr. bean with a wet jumper
you get raised to be told everyone's unique and different and blah blah blah  and then there's Klay Thompson
Never been an elite defender? Klay? Klay Thompson? Aight fam..
Klay Thompson is the  Zach Grienke of the NBA
I think Klay Thompson is a figment of all our imaginations lol
When did Tyler Herro play like Klay Thompson? Y'all just be talking out of your ass
"Klay Thompson, Zion."
"They do when they’re Bubble Frauds and have Tyler Herro playing like he’s Klay Thompson for 20 days, lol  What happened to ""stupidly locked in"" Jimmy this year and just about every other year?"

"Assuming you’re telling me this on Jan 1, 2019. This isn’t a fun fact at all, but I wouldn’t have believed you if you told me that as of late August 2021, Klay Thompson hadn’t played an NBA game since June 2019."
Klay Thompson might be my favorite NBA personality of all time.
What's the journalist interested in lying? At that time clippers were media darlings and championship favorites.  Also what about pat because history would suggest this is made up? It's not like someone claimed Tim Duncan said this or klay Thompson
Klay Thompson
Clay Klay Thompson with his Clay Thompson is the best thing I’ve ever seen
"We've been spoiled by having so many great shooters in the league over the past 5 years in addition to having the greatest 3 point shooter EVER on an amazing offense built to allow for open 3s (oh yea and they also had Klay Thompson, a top 5 shooter of all time).  Guys like Steph, Dame, Harden, and KD regularly hit shots that would have gotten a player benched 10-15 years ago and it's gotten so absurd that we're used to it and ok with it. In no universe should Luka be taking as many 3s or the type of 3s that he does. Trae is clearly going through a slump but at the same time he's a little too comfortable chucking up a difficult 3."
he’s just going to be big steve nash till he’s 50 and it’s gonna drive me nuts. then he’ll learn to shoot better and be klay thompson till he’s 60 and finally retires
"Those are probably the top-2, yes. Mychal/Klay Thompson are behind them. As are the Waltons, Nances, Barrys. I have high hopes for Domas in coming years as well!  On a side note, be nice to Seth. I miss Seth, especially following yesterday when Mavs-not-named-Luka went 2/20 from 3. Covid be damned. And JRich is great, but still miss Seth. Hope he recovers well, it was great watching him scorch the nets for PHI."
a rim protector cuz they already got offbrand klay thompson
"Any role player has a huge night against the Lakers. Take your pick, Gary Trent Jr just looked like Klay Thompson against us a few weeks ago"
Looks a lot like the (also uncalled) [foul](https://twitter.com/bballbreakdown/status/1135368130782351361) that caused Klay Thompson to miss a game in the 2019 Finals.
Unfortunately Klay Thompson has possibly the worst contract in the NBA. He will miss at least one full season and possibly a second. He may never return to form and even then it will be years since his last game. During that period he will have earned 70-110 million.
Klay Thompson
&gt; he’s more like Klay Thompson lite  I think this might be overreacting just a tad to a 12-game sample.
"I don’t think he has enough ability to create for himself to be the next Jimmy Butler right now. He has improved pretty rapidly so it’s possible he improves that part of his game, but right now I would say he’s more like Klay Thompson lite. Maybe a thicker Danny Green back when he was in his prime? He’s essentially Tony Allen with a jump shot which is pretty dang good"
it would be like If KD teamed up with Steph Curry and Klay Thompson
Klay thompson 😞
"Klay Thompson was an all-star too, that doesnt mean teams werent spending the vast majority of their resources trying to counter KD and Steph.  Middleton is a great player and an amazing shooter, so that space Giannis creates makes an already great player shoot at ridiculous numbers.  Im not arguing Middleton isnt great, Im arguing that Tatum is unquestionably better.   Defensively it’s a non-contest. Offensively, Tatum is still better by quite a bit IMO but I can understand arguments for the contrary, even though I strongly disagree with them."
give em the ole Klay Thompson
"Devin Booker,Klay Thompson,Kobe Bryant"
"The yeae before, Melo was the firsr guy in NY.  Rondo, Pippen, Worthy, McHale... Are not first type guys. But their are peefect to build a super team.  Randle is the number one guy in NY averaging crazy numbers. He's not a super team piece material.  Klay Thompson is the god complement player. Can't be number one because his style of play.  Everyone has their own definition about what's a super team.  But, in my opinion, if you have an all time great that the year before, and since his second year was THE GUY on his teams in Melo, an MVP who averaged a triple double during 3 seasons, a 3rd in MVP voting, all nba defense guy who can knock 3s like crazy + an interior enforcer... For me that's a super team. We don't see them as a superteam because it didn't work.  Same as Those Prokhorov Nets. But I remember the league being scared as shit, even saying the Russian was paying under handz because a team that had...   old but still  decent KG and Pierce. They had the same age as LeBron now  All star Joe Johnson  Andrei fucking Kirilenko (not im his prime, but still)   Deron Williams (who averaged the 3 seasons before 20/9)  20 ppg and all star the year before Brook Lopez  Jason Terry, who was the hero of the finals 2 seasons before  Shaun Livingston, who after that tenure was a fundamental piece in the GSW 3 rings  An enforcer like Evans, who had +11 boards per game the year before  And then good players.  Andray Blatche had 16ppg 2 years before  Teletovic was a solid player  Thorton averaged 12ppg and 38% from 3  Rookie Plumlee..."
I feel like Harden is redundant with Lebron and Curry already being such good on ball creators. Klay Thompson would make more sense imo
Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson and draymond green
"""pushed hard through rehab""  *Klay Thompson flashbacks*"
"""I ain't sacrificing shit"" -Klay Thompson"
Joe Harris kinda like Klay Thompson?
Lakers are definitely short a Klay Thompson but the homegrown guards are shooting above 50% to start the season.
Wow so Middleton is finally giving Klay Thompson level production
KCP has turned into Klay Thompson.
"Klay Thompson is currently getting paid $35 million dollars, and he cannot play this season. The Warriors are currently hemorrhaging money due to COVID - an enormous amount of their revenue came from Chase Center ticket sales, and despite that they haven't furloughed or laid off any of their staff. Is it unethical for Klay not to give some of his money back to the organization?"
"&gt;But instead of answering, you dodge the whole thought experiment.   The problem is that your ""thought experiment"" was the actual dodge. The argument was about showing up. Because you are trying to trap me into your comically narrow logic I will now answer the question to continue your ""thought experiment."" Yes. Chris Paul is better than Kyle Lowry.   Maybe the problem is here that we have different definitions of ""showing up."" To me showing up means playing to your ability. At work today I would say I didn't completely show up because I found out my friend died yesterday. I was at work but my mind wasn't.  I explained this before but when I say James Harden doesn't show up in the playoffs, I'm saying the edge he bring into the regular season is not there.   I pulled a stat specific to this conversation. It's a little random but bare with me. I tracked a bunch of stars that won championships to see how many playoff games they played where they shot less than 25% field goal percentage to show you an example of how much more frequently James Harden has a bad game in the playoffs. In no way am I saying this is a perfect stat but one factor in winning is obviously consistency.   I will list them ranked from least consistent to most consistent and you can tell me if it's a good indicator of greatness in any way.  Kawhi Leonard 3 times in 124 Magic Johnson 4 times in 190 Lebron James 3 times in 260  Larry Bird 2 times in 164 Michael Jordan 1 time in 179  At this time you are probably saying to yourself that these are all mid range shooters. Lets look at some 3 point shooters.  Kyrie Irving 5 times in 61 Damien Lillard 3 times in 55 Klay Thompson 6 times in 123 Steph Curry 4 times in 112  Kevin Durant 3 times in 139  There were definitely a bunch of players that were more inconsistent than Harden but I am only putting exceptional players because Harden gets regular season awards for being exceptional.  The amount of times Harden has shot less than 25% fg%: 14 times in 128 games. That's a lot more.  You want me to go into true shooting percentage and how great an indicator that is? He is below all the active players I listed that won a title as well.   He simply isn't a great playoff player and it takes being great to win.  You pointing out a couple specific games is completely missing the point. I never said he has never played well in the playoffs."
"I would say he's becoming this upcoming generation's Klay Thompson.   He's not the historic shooter Klay is but as you said, his defence and shooting (and cutting) makes him incredibly complementary. Plus, mindset wise he seems willing to sacrifice if it leads to wins.  He pairs well with Tatum but he could also play alongside:  * Luka * Giannis * Jokic * Simmons * Mitchell  * Murray * Ingram * Embiid * etc etc  He might not be the absolute best star in the league but of the young stars in the league he's becoming that guy who could fit on any team and next to any other star."
Klay Thompson
"Lol. So that’s the kind of guy you are.   Jesus Christ could come down to earth and do a Reddit AMA. And you would be the guy disagreeing with him and saying he was wrong. “You didn’t really create the universe in six days. I think it really took eight days.”  You have zero idea what is going to happen to a sports team next year, much less 3-4 years down the road.   Kyrie could retire. Durant could pull a Klay Thompson and Harden could get stabbed at a strip club and miss the season.   Harden and Durant could end up not getting along (there is a pattern) and both leave.   In all seriousness. If you honestly think you can predict what happens in a sports league 4-5 year down the road? You should quite your job. Max your credit cards and start betting pro sports."
"Joe Harris for Klay Thompson, who says no?"
Just pause the season until Klay Thompson comes back
"Ah, when Draymond is another year older and looks even more physically washed than he does now. And Klay Thompson is coming off two major injuries that we assume won’t impact his game. Gotcha."
"No, I'm not. I also said it depends on how you define a superstar. Y'all trying to make me look dumb for saying no one cared about Moses. It's not like I said he was bad, I just said he wasn't a superstar. Because he wasn't. Klay Thompson is more famous than Moses Malone. Moses wasn't a superstar. Period."
"Well that's just you being disingenuous IMO, his team was at a massive talent disadvantage, and the only reason they had a chance in that series was because of Harden, he was the only shot creator on that team once CP3 went down, and the other 2 team had 2 MVPs, and another 20+ PPG scorer in Klay, arguably the best 3rd option of all-time (well until now with this Nets team...).   Harden is just a worse version of LeBron. LeBron always lost to better teams, until he stacked the deck and made the best team and won championships. Even the Finals he's lost in 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, he gets a pass for because again, he lost to better teams and nobody rightfully holds that against them because there's an acknowledgement of the talent disadvantage he was at.   KD lost to better teams in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2016, until he stacked the deck in his favor and won championships.  You say LeBron took GS without Kyrie and Love to 6, and yeah, he did, but he didn't actually win that series and he was horribly inefficient. Does anybody *blame* him for that? No. Nobody sane does.   Harden took the 2019 Warriors to 6 with a decrepit Chris Paul who was useless for the first 5 games of that series, and yet somehow he gets blame for that? That series was INSANELY close, 2-2 after the first 4 games, with none of the games in that series being decided by more than 6 points. If you want to argue that he could've done better once KD went out, sure, but if anything that proves what every sane basketball fan believes, which is that Steph Curry &gt; James Harden. Klay Thompson was also a better #2 option than CP3 was at that time given his injuries, so again, he was at a talent disadvantage.   Point is, that Harden has never lost to any team where he was the favorite, where he had the better team. Now, you can argue that's what makes you a truly great player in this league.   However, has Kevin Durant done that before? Has Kawhi Leonard done that before?  Hell, has LeBron done that before?   It's really, really fucking hard to win a championship, which is why these superstars just stack the deck in their favor to try and increase the odds. The NBA has never been more like Game of Thrones than it is right now."
There is no way the media and nephews were wrong. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson changed modern basketball with volume three balls. They were going to be a top 3 contender and would be this year if klay wasn’t hurt. There was a lot of parity in the west with Durant in OKC. It was ridiculous when he went to Golden State. Everyone knew they would win and they did.   Imagine if Giannis went to the Lakers. That’s how ridiculous KD signing with Golden State was
I've said this before but the man plays like he thinks he's klay Thompson
"Now no one else wants to say it...but fuck it, I will :  These guys that the Warriors currently have, just aren't as good as Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. Don't really care how much this offends u"
One bad elimination game doesn’t make you a choker. Harden consistently shits the bed in big games. Look back to the last playoffs. Murray and Mitchell were going off and carrying their teams. Tatum could step up big. Klay Thompson has been a difference maker.  All of those guys have delivered gutsy performances while Harden has had more chances than all of them combined.
"They’re ability to contend is based solely on how Klay Thompson returns from an ACL and a calcaneal tendon tear. Klay won’t be back until December or January anyway. If Klay isn’t as good as he was, the Warriors can’t beat either the Lakers nor Brooklyn."
Imagine if Klay Thompson was 7 feet tall. He could make 20 threes with zero dribbles.
Kuzma could make so much money in China as a Klay Thompson impersonator.
DRose is an MVP  DRose by your logic is better than Kawhi   Yawn   Iggy&gt;Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson didn’t I remember very vividly
Klay Thompson? We must be pretty loose with the superstar title
Neither of them have worst contract in NBA. It's Klay Thompson by a longshot.
1. Lebron 2. Anthony Davis 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Luka Doncic 7. Steph Curry 8. Klay Thompson 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Paul George 11. Jayson Tatum 12. Joel Embiid 13. Nikola Jokic 14. Damien Lillard 15. Giannis Antetokunpo  Honorable mentions:  Devin Booker/Chris Paul/Rudy Gobert/Donavan Mitchell/Jamal Murray. To say top 15 easy is laughable.
Klay Thompson is also known to be a huge Harry Potter fan. Could y'all imagine the hilarity of a Lopez bros + Klay podcast about ... Harry Potter ?
Porzingis is playing like a 7”2 Klay Thompson without the three point shooting lmaoo. No dribble and all bricks lmao.
"did you give a shit about Klay Thompson going out partying, posting on IG live without a mask on right before  going to sit right beside your guys on the bench?  &amp;#x200B;  probably not. don't pretend you actually care about that"
"the amount people care about him partying was exaggerated as hell. plenty of NBA players were seen out partying, only a select few did people pretend to care about. nobody ever talks about what klay thompson was doing before he'd go sit courtside at games with the teams"
"&gt;Historically, the 2019 Warriors nearly pushing the Raptors to a Game 7 without Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant would be the ultimate example.  This isn't ewing theory at work though. Ewing theory states that a team gets noticeably better when their star player isn't playing. That warriors team 100 percent was NOT better with no KD or klay thompson."
I legitimately forgot Klay Thompson existed
MPJ is more a bigger Klay Thompson atm  He doesn't quite have handles yet to create for himself off the dribble like KD
Lots of guys play a shit load of minutes as Ironman and then break down suddenly. Klay Thompson and Tristan Thompson come to mind. Harden was also out of shape this year and that puts a huge extra strain on your body. Add on the fact he was ramping up minutes and load a lot with extra weight and less training it’s no wonder he’s been dealing with injury.
"# i like klay thompson, he is a good dude  &amp;#x200B;  # when he plays good basketball i think to myself ""yes""  &amp;#x200B;  # but when he beats the blazers i think to myself ""no"""
I ducking love Klay Thompson
"These girls are passed around though. They are hoes and sluts. So it's not like these dudes are fucking 10s who also happen to be virgins. Most of these girls aren't even all that with all the make-up, plastic surgeries and baggage they have. Just doesn't make sense to have a relationship with them or get them pregnant. They are literally made to have fun and move on. Klay Thompson did it right. Derek Jeter another guy that did it the right way."
"We need to brain storm, how to come up with alternative media, to replace game revenue.   NBA gonna be like, 10% less revenue? Nah  But if we could come up with unique production segments. I'm talking, weight room coverage, NBA cribs, popular youtubers with guest NBA player segments for hobbies and exercise demonstrations.  NBA dogs TV.  Do brain storm everything. Rule out the dumb shit. Send out some surveys.  Pitch it to the NBA players, have if houre willing to do some of this goofy shit, you won't have to play as many games, your body will be better protected, we will try to maintain your current pay, and maybe you'll even find it fun.  Like why can the NBA not have a goofy 26 minute TV show, with 8 minutes of Klay Thompson cruisng around on a boat. And Steph curry visiting some historic tourism sites or something."
Klay Thompson aka Al Cowlings of The Bay
I miss Klay Thompson.
"Oubre was acquired in a trade with OKC for a second round pick, using the trade exception from trading away Iguodala iirc. The Klay Thompson Injury Exception was granted a month or so later, and the Warriors never used it. This, again, points to ownership probably not wanting to spend because of tax implications"
"&gt; I understand he ruined Lebron's best game ever,  That has to be the biggest hyperbole coming out of the 2018 finals, second only to LeBron claiming his right hand was 'basically broken'. It would only have ruined the game only if he managed to make the right shot/ right pass to a shooter in time. No one mentions how KD's poor boxing out gift wrapped that opportunity.   I agree JR's spacing contribution is always underrated and he turns into hot Klay Thompson in pivotal moments."
"100%  Coaching matters in the NBA, but much less than people think. First and foremost, you need a good roster. The Blazers haven't had a team that could truly compete for a title. Dame is good enough to be the best player on a championship team, but their second &amp; third options aren't good enough and the rest of the bench isn't good enough.  He needs his Klay Thompson and Draymond Green - CJ and Nurk aren't going to cut it. You could replace Stotts with Nurse (best coach in the league imo) and *maybe* they make it to the WCF at best, but you can't compete for a championship without having a top tier roster."
"a) is Klay Thompson available to any other team? (no)  b) Will Klay's contract be more valuable than CJ's once he returns from injury? This is more of a rhetorical, and should be accompanied with an ""I'm sorry""."
That’s more than Klay Thompson I think lol
"Huge waste of talent, dude needs to put on weight and muck up the paint with some pick and pop play but he wants to be Klay Thompson"
Where was that on last year's game 7 😭😭  I'm gonna blame the anomaly of the bubble. I mean Herro played like Klay Thompson on the bubble
"Pat Bev was there for the 1st year with MDA, Ariza for year 1 and 2, PJ for years 2-4, and Capela for years 1-3.5. I don't think that is the difference defensively between Rockets and Blazers. Don't get me wrong, PJ is an amazing defender and Capella was good but he wasn't as impactful with Rockets as he has been with the Hawks defensively. Ariza was amazing and definitely huge for the year as the #6 defense but the last 2 years the Rockets were better than the Blazers even without him.  I think the biggest issue is having 2 average at best defensively starting guards. Dame is below average and CJ is better but not amazing. In the West especially I feel like a lot of the major scoring threats are Guards. Curry, Harden, Jamal Murray, Luka, Ja Morant, CP3, Booker, Donovan Mitchell, and Klay Thompson when healthy. I think that's a huge reason Blazers played the Nuggets so close, especially with Jamal out. It's bad when Austin Rivers is exploiting your defense in the playoffs."
"Lol what, the overwhelming majority of slander Kyrie gets has nothing to do with basketball, *and* he’s got a bigger ‘playoff killer’ reputation than he should because nobody cares when second options have bad series as long as the team wins anyway and only pay attention when they’re great (see also: Klay Thompson, OKC Westbrook, Tony Parker)."
Pretty sure klay Thompson did this exact thing in 2016 but no one gave a damn. Everyone needs to stop constantly shitting on players and stoop getting so mad over ridiculous shit like if he didn’t shake the suns hands. Just take them for what they are and enjoy the ride because they’re not gonna be around forever
Y tf Reggie Jackson playing like prime Klay Thompson all game
Luke Kennard is Dookie Klay Thompson
THJ is literally Klay Thompson in this series
"Idk ask that warriors/klay thompson flair u/tayklompson who said ""\* team played in NBA Bubble to compete for a Mickey Mouse ring. Not recognized as a real championship. Fraudulent team otherwise who aren't able to compete in a real game and are ""lead"" by an entitled sore-loser who gives up when things don't go his way""   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nsesz1/since\_1950\_the\_los\_angeles\_lakers\_have\_gone\_to/"
"They can all shoot off-ball, but so can Kyle Korver or JJ Redick. They’re a great combination of talent, but there are a lot of redundancies. They’re all very skilled with the ball in their hands, so using 2 of the 3 players as spot up shooters is not taking advantage of their ballhandling talents.    Nobody is saying they’re not an amazing team, just that they’re not “perfect complements”. For example, Kyrie is better than Klay Thompson but the Nets would definitely be better swapping Kyrie for a healthy Thompson."
To think that the Bookers drew a comparison to Klay Thompson on selection day.   I believe that simply playing alongside Chris Paul and probing his brain has improved his BBIQ.   He's also playing off-ball way more.
"Klay Thompson died, or we’re just not counting him as active?"
"His handles are nowhere near as good as KD, he's more like a 6'10 Klay Thompson"
Klay Thompson runs through walls too.
"Sometimes, people that aren't Kenny Smith need to remind Kenny Smith that in his best seasons, he was like, the third option.  And not a Klay Thompson on the KD warriors third option, like a third option on Giannis bucks behind Kris Middleton third option. Man swears he was that dude back in the day."
"True. But this year appears to be worse than ever. Just off the top of my head the following guys had injuries this year: Lebron, Anthony Davis, Hardin, KD, CP3, Murray, Westbrook, Klay Thompson. There’s others. The league has an injury problem that I wish they’d figure out. It sucks when the best players miss time."
To be fair Joe Harris is no slouch. He’s basically a more cerebral Klay Thompson.
"Even at that Kyrie was a top 20 player Love wasn't.  KAT, Lebron, Steph, KD, Harden, Russ, Paul George, Kawhi, Dame, Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, John Wall, Kyrie, Derozan, Lowry, Hayward, Cousins (pre injury still), at absolute minimum where better than Love with more players being arguable. Y'all literally call anything a superteam."
LeBron isn't leaving Cleveland if Eric Snow was Klay Thompson. Curry is blessed to be a warrior
"Bro what? He was guarded by the likes of Klay Thompson and Draymond.   He gets the best guard defender every matchup ie Jrue, Vanvleet, etc."
"he absolutely is, so is Harris...by that logic Klay Thompson wouldn’t be considered one of the best of the best"
"Report: Warriors are hopeful Klay Thompson returns this season. More news at 11, Mike."
"Devin Booker reminds me of Klay Thompson. Looks like him, has a perfect release like him, and get hot as fuck like him. Crazy that he got 70 in a game once. Dude is a baller"
Klay Thompson hasn't played basketball in two years. It is not illogical to assume he will not be Klay Thompson when he comes back.
We are witnessing the alternate timeline where Klay Thompson has a handle and iso creation
Didn’t LeBron take offense to Klay Thompson doing this? LeHypocrite.
"&gt;He whines at the refs, teammates, and coaches.  Refs sure, but teammates and coaches? What? Calling them out on them not playing well or whatever is fine?   &gt;Completely gives up towards the end of games and then leaves without a basic show of respect that all players do.  He showed the Warriors respect so don't act like he never does this.   &gt;I.e. Bad boy pistons after bulls loss, Klay Thompson 2016, get shit for it, because it’s completely lacking in the grace that a professional should have.  Lol please. Losing is very frustrating and not swallowing that frustration to congratulate the other team in the name of good sportsmanship and to appease fans like you is fine."
"That is absolutely an asshole move. But I’m not even just talking about that. He showboats and taunts when he’s winning and does this when he loses. He whines at the refs, teammates, and coaches. Completely gives up towards the end of games and then leaves without a basic show of respect that all players do. The ones that don’t, I.e. Bad boy pistons after bulls loss, Klay Thompson 2016, get shit for it, because it’s completely lacking in the grace that a professional should have."
"&gt; You never destroyed shit.  Destroyed three HOFers.  &gt; Toronto beat a banged up team and the Lakers ring is just as valid.  One guy was out. Lakers faced two All Stars for four games, with no fans, no games on the road after three month break.  &gt; You want to pretend the Warriors team was the same team that won the chip but it wasn’t.  Hmmm it pretty much was. The starting lineup for the 2015 finals which the Warriors won consisted of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut. For the 2019 finals which the Warriors LOST consisted of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green and Demarcus Cousins who is an upgrade over Bogut. 4/5 are the same and one is an upgrade lmao.  &gt;  I’ve repeated my argument over and over because you’ve never destroyed it.  I destroyed it before it ever began. Sorry to say."
"&gt; Sadly, you have to factor in the team and what affects what, not just the names and accolades.  MMMM you're right they had to rely on back to back MVP Curry and best post season shooter Klay Thompson. Must've been real tough! /s  &gt; And they looked gassed because? That's right, it's because KD wasn't there and they weren't deep enough to spread those minutes around.  Who was their backup small/power forward when they went 73-9 or when they won the chip in 2015? Oh it was either Harrison Barnes or Kevon Looney. Well would you look at that, they had Looney in those finals against my Raptors and Jerebko who was slightly worse than Barnes was. I'd say the backups were pretty much the same as their 2015 chip...  &gt; Just pretend that the Lakers faced the Nuggets in the finals. They were a scary team with Murray playing like a superstar.  I do pretty much. That was the real NBA Finals for 2020."
Klay Thompson cosplay
"It's bad sportsmanship to insult the other team or something like that.   Klay Thompson left after losing the finals in 2016. That was fine.   It's cool that Curry did that, but if he didn't I wouldn't hold it against him at all."
"Klay played in like 19 of the 24 quarters of that series, the whole GSW was so banged up narrative is so overblown   Obviously they didn’t have Durant which obviously hurt them, but they still had Steph, Dray and Klay for a vast majority of that series   Maybe if you need Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Boogie all fully healthy to win a title then just maybe the other team is good and deserves credit too?  And it’s not like the Raptors were all 100% either. Kawhi could barely walk during the ECF, Lowry had to have surgery after the playoffs, Siakam was nursing an injury throughout the playoffs and they were missing their second best defender all playoffs long"
Or like Klay Thompson after the 2016 finals?  Who gives a fuck? This is just drama baiting.
“I guess his feelings just got hurt.” - Klay Thompson
"&gt; He dropped 30 then got injured.  I know you're stupid, but here's the fucking Box Score to make you STFU... https://www.nba.com/game/tor-vs-gsw-0041800406/box-score#box-score  What does it say you dumbass idiot? Game 6? Check. TOR wins Series 4-2? Check. Klay Thompson 30 points? Check. NotFrankSalazar is a complete fucking clown? Check :)  &gt; Yea they won before him, but they gave up a ton of depth to sign him.  Yeah totally, they went from a team that had four All-Star caliber players to a team of five All-Star players. They sure gave up a lot! /s"
God damn Crowder out there looking like a bigger Klay Thompson.
"Klay Thompson, Klay Thompson. 6 foot 7 made of radiation. Opponents beware.  The West beware. He’s coming. He’s coming. He’s coming."
"Where did he say that in this interview? Full text below.     `The Warriors have gone up against some of the league's best players and teams since the emergence of their home-grown trio of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green.`    `Green is one of -- if not the best -- defenders in the league, and has been tasked with guarding some elite offensive talent throughout his nine-year NBA career.`    `The Warriors forward sat down for a Bleacher Report ""AMA"" on Wednesday where he answered questions from fans around the league.`      `One person asked: ""The hardest player you have guarded in your NBA career is ___""`   `""Kevin Durant,"" Green responded. ""Nobody is impossible to guard, but he is as close to impossible as it gets.""`     `Once former teammates, Durant and Green have plenty of history playing with, and against each other.Was Draymond sending Warriors message while analyzing Wiz`   `Now on separate teams following Durant's departure from Golden State, Green -- as a guest analyst on TNT's ""Inside the NBA"" -- recently predicted Durant's Brooklyn Nets as the team to win the NBA Finals.`   `In addition to Durant, Green named another player that he has had a tough time with throughout his career.`   `""And Manu Ginobili,"" Green added. ""He used to move downhill, but moving sideways. The moment you see him moving to the left -- euro step.""`   `His response was interesting because both Durant and Ginobili are two very different players.`    `There aren't many players who have success against Green, who is once again a nominee for the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year award. The ones that do though, are future Hall of Famers.` "
"Devin ""Steph 'Klay Thompson' Curry"" Booker"
"Klay Thompson has not played in two seasons, is over 31 and will be making $43.2 million at the end of the 23-24 season"
"Jae ""Game 6 Klay Thompson"" Crowder"
"leg injuries tend to lead to other injuries in other parts of the leg... see: Demarcus Cousins, Klay Thompson, etc... plus he was already resting for the chronic Achilles problem, I'd be really nervous if I was a Lakers fan"
Makes you really appreciate what Klay Thompson did in 1 quarter  MPJ has been lights out like it’s hard to imagine being hotter than he was in the first. Sky is really the limit for MPJ
"MPJ is a 6'10"" Klay Thompson already."
He heard the comparisons to klay Thompson and decided to go full game 6 klay 👀
Klay Thompson is the most worried person rn
MPJ or Klay Thompson?
So we’re just gonna pretend that ain’t Klay Thompson out there masquerading as MPJ?
Nuggets have a 6’10 Klay Thompson on the floor right now. I can only imagine the damage they’d be dealing if they had Jamal
"Holy shit, getting Klay Thompson kind of hot"
"They compare very similarly really. Your problem is you are basing too much on the finals vs the 1st round instead of comparing the 4 teams in question. You need to look at each series in a vacuum when comparing luka vs lebron carrying their team.   Steph, klay did not have a good series vs the cavs in the finals. Steph was playing like pandemic p for the first 2 and a half games. Klay avg 15 ppg. That didn't have anything to do with lebron it was a mix of them choking and the defense of delly and Tristan thompson. The warriors won because of their superior depth and steph played much better towards the end of the series. There was no one on the warriors playing like kawhi has in this series.  I'm not arguing luka is carrying more than lebron did that series and I give lebron the edge for doing it on the biggest stage, but you are sloughing it off as not close, maybe you're a lebron fanboy?"
Or klay Thompson or Kevin Durant
Collin Cowherd said Klay Thompson is D Wade with a better jump-shot
At this point its Klay Thompson
"You're also lying about ""firing on all cylinders"" warriors team. Did you watch the series? Steph gagged the first 2-3 games of the series and got locked up by dellavadova. None of the 3 stars played good enough to win finals mvp. Klay thompson only had 15 ppg on bad efficiency. The warriors weren't a champion before that season either"
"Kevin Looney did not decide any factor of an NBA championship.   Barring KD's injury which goes back to the 2nd round of the playoffs. The Warriors still had 3 all-stars(4 if you want to count Cousins). The Raptors already beat the Warriors twice with Klay Thompson and it was a tight game when he got hurt in game 6. So, who's to say they would have automatically lost?   The Warriors won a title when Kyrie missed the series. The Cavs won a title when Draymond Green was suspended. Magic Johnson missed the 89 finals. Yet, somehow the Raptors who still played a very competitive team that won a title with that core 4 years prior should be vilified."
"I mean, if it quacks like a duck... it's probably a duck.  I found a 48 min podcast that he's on, I'll have to find time to listen to it.  https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/klay-thompson/id1451871735?i=1000458555491"
"And KD has played with Harden, Steph, Kyrie, Klay Thompson, Draymond, and Westbrook. It’s crazy"
"Haha, nice one.  Reminds me of my Klay story where I saw Klay Thompson at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
Steph Curry  Dwyane Wade  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Shaq
"""Hi I'm Klay Thompson, welcome to Jackass"""
Who exactly is gonna fight 6ft6 Klay Thompson LMAO
"""a lot"" not really. Most streamers make minimum wage and are in the fast lane towards a heart attack.  I get it though, society has accepted gaming as a hobby. Not sure what this has to do with Klay or your projection of yourself onto Klay Thompson."
Yea feels like he needs a Klay Thompson type for his #2 but idk how many other #2s play like that. That or a Kyrie type who can get a bucket whenever. Basically the LeBron blueprint.
Interesting take from Chuck there on Inside The NBA saying Klay Thompson was the greatest player of all time
"I love the Klay story in Iggy's book. But I also love this Klay story by Joe Lacob.  Lacob once asked Thompson what he did for fun. Thompson simply responded, “I like to shoot.” Lacob explained that he meant what Thompson did off the floor. Thompson shrugged and repeated himself: “I like to shoot.”"
That’s the most Klay Thompson-like story to have ever happened
"Who thought it would be a good idea to have Klay Thompson say, ""the odds have never stopped us"""
Fuck yes! I needed a Klay Thompson return commercial more than anything in the world!
i love klay thompson and i don’t care what anyone thinks about that
"Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson"
Hilarious Klay Thompson story. Gold please
I fucking love Klay Thompson
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, KAT, Myles Turner."
Never forget Klay Thompson got interviewed about scaffolding.
The Klay Thompson interview kills me
My team:  Steph Curry  Klay Thompson  Michael Jordan  Tim Duncan  Shaq
"Curry Klay Kawhi Draymond (whose shooting doesn’t regress as much imo) Pau is a very close match. Warriors have one of the best defences of all time, and the best shooting team of all time. Whilst Curry, Klay, Kawhi may not be as good as Lebron, KD and Kyrie, Dray and Pau are much better than Love and Thompson. This match isn’t clear either side but it’s in GSW favour imo.  It’s the best offence of all time vs one of the best offences and defences."
Klay Thompson asks people if they appreciate wood
I personally don’t see him turning into someone you can build around. Obviously a different type of player but he’s more of a Klay Thompson-type guy to me that can’t be the best player on the team if you expect to win.      If you feel otherwise that’s cool but it’s beside the point to a degree. The overwhelming majority of Sixers fans know the team will look worse on paper with a Simmons trade.
I'd **MAYBE** say no.  Hear me out:  1. Steph is 33 on a max contract until he's 37   \- How many more years will be elite?    2. Klay is 31 on a max contract until 34.   \- What Klay Thompson am I getting back?  Will either guy try as hard in a new city?  Joel is 27 and signed util he's 33 (player option).  Steph is a better player than Joel but in terms of rarity- They are both top at their position.  There are more decent guards than there are decent centers available IMO.  So I'm just trading one problem for another.  Going to be hard to find my new center.... Or not maybe.  Actually a harder question than Joel makes it I think.  Being too humble.
Klay Thompson is not made of clay
Klay Thompson &amp; RIP Hamilton bad offensive players ?
Klay Thompson. Nuff said.
"Klay Thompson had the benefit of also playing defense, which I'm sure MPJ has heard of, but Lord knows he's never inquired about.  That said, he is a good offensive player. Anyone who can give you the points he does on the efficiency he has is going to be valuable in any system. He does need to work on his ball handling though, because not being able to put the ball on the ground will likely be the difference between a $20-$25 million contract and a max."
The Worm hasn't played in the NBA in almost 20 years and he is still mentioned more than Klay Thompson. So who do you think?
Don't compare Klay Thompson to Khris Middleton...
"To be fair to Simmons, Sixers failed to build team that complement him.  To be fair for the Sixers its damn hard to build team around when Simmons and Embiid are together in the same team. But it's not impossible, the complement star must be a scoring guard, someone like Bradley Beal, Klay Thompson, CJ, Lilard, Lavine might be it. Tobi is a bad fit for Embiid and Simmons duo and why that's line up not working out which made Simmons get all the blame.  This is by no mean a shade to Tobi, he is a good player but the three cores just don't fit. These relationship don't work out. Someone has to go, and Simmons want to be that guy that move out."
That’s no worse than 2015/2016 Klay Thompson so yeah it’s good enough on a deep  team with a true superstar #1. Like we literally just saw.
"KD is probably the best ceiling raiser ever. And yeah why would you want MJ? What do you want with the best scorer ever who is also one of the best defensive guards to ever play, when you can have Curry who is worse in every conceivable way.    Not even going to touch Klay Thompson just going to pretend you didn’t actually write him."
Lol. No offense but Klay Thompson should be nowhere near an all time team.
"So if LeBron and Luka guard each other, they're suddenly PGs? But if they're guarding Klay Thompson, they're suddenly SGs???"
"Klay Thompson is a great shooter, but he is not great at the step back. Donavon Mitchel is a great shooter, but he does not have a great high post game. You are just not appeciating how skilled someone like Jamal Murray has to be to be able to perform all these facets of scoring. Summed up, you are over conflating shooting percentages with pure skill"
"PG - Steph Curry  SG - Klay Thompson   SF - Lebron James  PF - Kevin Durant   C - Hakeem Olajuwon   Basically take the most talented team ever assembled, give them Lebron and Hakeem, idc what combination of MJ/Bird/Magic you have. No one is beating this team. It’s Lebron + shooters on another level."
I completely forgot that Klay Thompson and the big three(+1) celtics overlapped at some point. Feels like different eras
Klay Thompson (Booker) Isaiah Thomas (CP3) David Robinson (Ayton) Khris Middleton (Bridges) Shane Battier (Crowder)   Off the bench   Devin Harris (Payne) Doug McDermott (Johnson) Andrew Bynum (McGee) Greivis Vásquez (Shamet) Nenad Krstić (Kaminsky)  Yeah I’d say that’s a pretty good team.
"Actual Starting 5 - Stephen Curry , Klay Thompson , Andrew Wiggins , Draymond Green , James Wiseman   Their Draft comparisions - Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf , Marco Belinelli , Vince Carter/Rudy Gay , Jared Dudley/Luke Harangody , Hassan Whiteside/DeAndre Jordan"
It was random dude like 2 pages into google lol. I was looking for what I wanted on that one.  [found it](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/2020-nba-draft-sleepers-aaron-nesmith-compares-warriors-klay-thompson)
I found Klay Thompson as Nesmith on a google search (not nbadraft.net) because I thought Cam Johnson and RoCo were terrible comps for a pure shooter that was a 50% shooter in college. I saw it as a ceiling comp on some website I never heard of lol.
wait whose comp was Klay Thompson? I thought maybe it'd be Nesmith but they have him as Cam Johnson or RoCo
"Dwayne Wade, Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler, Danny Granger, Horace Grant  Pretty damn good lmfao"
"Not even a little bit. I wouldnt expect anyone in the entire league to be able to do it without specific training. A 5k? Sure. Maybe a healthy klay thompson, rip hamilton-type could do extremely well in the 5k"
"Lebron James has more 3 pointers made than JJ Redick, Klay Thompson, Peja Stojakovic and Kevin Durant...Does that mean Lebron is better at 3's than all of them?"
Luka Doncic - Klay Thompson - Kawhi Leonard - Zion Williamson - PJ Washington.
[Queue the Klay Thompson Meme](https://imgur.com/a/73L264L)
"I don't think even a fully healthy Norman Powell gets near injury replacement for the All Star game.  A ""third to fourth option on a team"" is the All Star team comprised of only 5 teams' players?  If you're the ""third to fourth option on a team"" then you're not an All Star unless you're like Klay Thompson on a dynasty Warriors team or a member of that weird 60-win Hawks team in a wet paper bag Eastern Conference.    And, no, 18-19 ppg (in the 2020s!), when scoring is by far your most valuable contribution, is not fringe All Star worthy.  Like at all.  He's starter quality at SG, sure, and that's fine, but I'd rather have a starter level big wing like Barnes 100 days out of 100."
"Ah shit I had a whole response that I guess didn’t get through, my bad!  Alright so to respond to one thing: if you are saying you don’t think the gap between the overall USA talent pool and the rest of the world is huge, I just completely disagree. Giannis, Luka, Jokic, Embiid, and Gobert are all star international players, but none of them have even a 2nd star on their roster. Their teams perform well in the olympics for that exact reasons- because they play together all the time and are actually a team. If you took Giannis off this years Bucks squad, and just ran their all american lineup of Middleton-Jrue-Brook Lopez- Connaughton- Pj Tucker, that team would dominate the Olympics. It’s just that this USA team had a really shortened window to practice because of Covid/ the NBA season being pushed back.  I don’t understand the point you are trying to make about Dame and KD. Yes they are superstar players, and while I don’t necessarily think Tatum will be as good as KD 4 years from now, it’s not at all crazy to think that some combination of 2 of any of these young USA guys will 4 years from now be as good as Dame/ KD. Also worth pointing out that the Olympic team is struggling in large part because Dame and KD are playing awful, so I don’t see the logic in saying a different version without them is automatically better.  Anyways, in a larger sense, if the USA sends a full or even semi full team in 2024, we will absolutely dominate. This years team is missing so many key guys: Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis…. which is literally maybe the best starting 5 we can roll out overall.  I’m not sure exactly what point you are trying to make. The USA is still by far the most talented Olympic team, despite how poorly we’ve played, and you not seeing why a different team 4 years from now can be better than this does not make any sense to me. If that 2024 team develops and everyone wants to play, it could be an all time great roster. Who knows though, obviously just speculation at this point."
"&gt;While that’s not a perfect metric, it defies reality that they’re crushing it in the draft so much more than anyone else when they’ve gotten some serviceable role players and 1 borderline all star. Your system just seems to reward consistency of picks over actual impact of players that matter.  I disagree that it values consistency. It values drafting good talent when little good talent was available. The Raptors have made a lot out of very little.  I think you're criminally under-rating some of the Raptors draft picks by calling them ""serviceable role players"". They landed one star player, two high-end starters on good playoff teams (OG is a premier 3&amp;D player at a young age, Powell scores an efficient 20 ppg as a mid 2nd round pick), and a few serviceable role players (which isn't a gimme that late in the draft). Just as important, they had no big misses (Daniels and Caboclo being relatively small misses).  That's an incredible haul given what they had in draft picks (in terms of both quantity of picks and draft position).  &gt;For example, It ranks Poetl (drafted #9) as being significantly better than Klay (drafted 11th).  Their scores aren't that different, but this is basically two reasons. First, a number of good players were drafted after Thompson. Second, a *lot* of bad players were drafted after Poeltl. Advanced stats also quite like Poeltl, largely because he's an excellent defensive player.  Maybe advanced stats are giving Poeltl a bit too much credit (I could buy that), but those results don't seem insane to me. I would say the methodology is working exactly like it's supposed to by in this case. That result might ""feel"" wrong looking at it, but I think with the full context it starts to make sense.  Klay is also obviously the outlier among GSW's three big picks—Green has a 3.2 and Steph has a 3.5. Both of those are among the best scores in the entire dataset (as they should be!). Because in both cases, they were *way* better than the other options."
Klay Thompson isn’t ready to come and save the Warriors season
"They would beat a team with Curry on it. Everyone has to be solid on defense. Curry would be a swinging door and you can’t hide him. Not to mention you can hand and shoulder Check in FIBA 3x3.   I would replace Curry with Kawhi Leonard. Klay Thompson would be better in 3x3 than Curry  And I love Curry but his game is meant for NBA 5x5. He won’t have any space in 3x3. Guys like Kyrie, Trae, Damian Lillard and Chris Paul would also get exposed and do very very poorly in 3x3 too"
"No.  The rules are different and FIBA 3x3 is super fast paced. It’s non stop. There is no stoppage, no time outs. Those 40 year old retired players would have a heart attack after one game or tear an ACL or rupture an achilles   It’s also more physical. Hand checking is allowed. Even shoulder checking is not called. If a player has a weakness in their game, especially on defense, it will get exposed  If america wants to win gold in 3x3 in the Olympics, they’re going to need to send their best YOUNG players  Even then, guys like Steph Curry, Kyrie, Damian Lillard, Trae Young, etc would get EXPOSED. They’re not built for the 3x3 format. They would be complete liabilities on defense and they can’t be hidden. They would get hammered physically. James Harden and Chris Paul would have to ditch their foul-baiting and flopping ways since they wouldn’t get ANY calls  Lebron would adjust and adapt and do very well in 3x3. Kawhi Leonard would also be excellent. Kevin Durant might struggle with the physicality but the dude can still shoot over anyone so he would be a good pick up. John Wall would be great as well. So would Klay Thompson. Westbrook would be excellent…..except he has a super inconsistent outside shot and you have to be able to shoot in 3x3.   If America sends guys like 50 year olds like Stephen Jackson, Cuttino Mobley and Iso Joe, they’re not going to last, especially playing two games a day. They will absolutely tear something or get a heart attack"
"Ingram technically have the tools to be an elite defender if we consider his unreal wingspan (7'4) and standing reach (9'1), plus great mobility.  Zion tho, definitely not. Not fast enough to guard smaller ones and not talle enought to guard bigger players. His average standing reach (8'7, same as Klay thompson) and short arms (his wingspan is wide just because he has damn wide shoulders) prevent him to be elite. In NBA right now I can count only Butler as a player with short arms and yet able to be great on defense.   All the good ones (even at all-time level) had/have elite length.  Othern than this, to be a good defender you need the right mindset and instinct. Neither Ingram and Zion got that. And doesn't matter if Zion looked ok in NCAA on defense because at college level many awful defenders looks elite.  Ingram is like young KD: potentially all the tools to not just good but excellent on defense but zero will to even try it."
"Klay Thompson is definitely a social activist ([source 1](https://abc7news.com/warriors-klay-thompson-instagram-breonna-taylor/10415385/) [source 2](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-klay-thompson-makes-plea-justice-elijah-mcclain). Funny how fans are obsessed with supporting Hong Kong, despite having players who are heavily influenced by China."
"In Washington DC most stay at the Ritz Carlton downtown. I used to live near there, and you could often see some team buses around. My roommate once met Klay Thompson on the street when GSW was in town"
Strongly reminds me of that one Klay Thompson copy pasta about his ankles and his dog and chocolate milk lmfao
"Even worse tho, if they had the 8th pick they could have gotten either Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, or Kawhi Leonard."
This Klay Thompson mf
Prepolic shoots like klay thompson but cant make a layup lol
"Four lottery picks for an undersized shooting guard whose 3pt shooting has declined each of the last four years and who is earning a max deal and plays the same position as another player they already have who is himself on a max deal.   Um...   I mean, Beal is a great player, but they give up something in size and defense and take a HUGE cap hit.   So giving up FOUR players who are all lottery picks.  With those picks this year, the Warriors could get two rotation players, even starters and potentially future All-Stars.  And Wiseman is more what the Warriors need right now than Beal. He's rough around the edges, but he's a teenager.   The Warriors are in a unique situation, like the Lakers were when they got to pick James Worthy or the Celtics when they got to draft Len Bias. Adding great young talent to a dynasty to give them a re-charge and extend their window?   That's better than trading for an undersized shooting guard when they already got Klay Thompson."
"KD has always been a better player than Klay. Klay doesn't have to create shots on ball like KD does, and he doesn't have the athleticism that KD had. A significant part of Klay's value besides running off screens and being a godly shooter was his on-ball defense which does not age well.   KD has also not been out for two entire seasons (and Klay might be out for part of next season too).  So basically you're saying paying Klay Thompson 35-40 million dollars a year for the next 3 years after he's had two major injuries, hasn't played in two years, won't play until probably December/January of this year and we don't even know what he looks like is not a negative asset? Talk about blind homerism. Which insane team will take a look at that contract and be like ""Yeah I totally will give up positive assets for a guy who doesn't create shots for himself and others on a max deal for the next 3 years"". If that's your argument, then go ahead and become a GM."
"Firstly, it's three consecutive seasons of serious injury issues. Doesn't have to be season ending to have injury affect play.  **Players definitively better than Westbrook (23)**  Embiid, Harden, Kyrie, KD, Giannis, Middleton, Trae Young, Tatum, Butler, Beal, Gobert, Mitchell, Chris Paul, Booker, Jokic, Kawhi, Paul George, Luka, Lillard, LeBron, AD, Curry, KAT,  If you disagree with any player on this list, we just have fundamental differences in how we understand basketball.  **Players that rank around where Westbrook is (15)**  Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Bam, Jaylen Brown,  Sabonis, Brogdon, Zach Lavine, Kyle Lowry, Siakam, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Demar Derozan, Zion, Dearon Fox.  Notable omissions from this list include Jamal Murray and Klay Thompson.  I personally have him behind pretty much everyone except McCollum, and DeRozan which puts him number 37.  If just half the guys on the second list are better (ranking them is splitting hairs), Westbrook is in that 30-45 range that I have him at.  If you list the players like that it really isn't that outrageous  or disrespectful to have Westbrook where I have him.   If you have him better than everyone on the second list, which puts him at 24, I'll just think you're a biased fan."
"&gt;When did I suggest players going directly against FO? It is bad if you let players decide specifics ie. x must join their team and x must leave the team and I agree there, I said this. And I mentioned that Steph, Klay, and Dray aren't doing this, they are simply asking the FO to prioritize or have the openness to seek win-now moves because they are a championship core and championship cores don't come by easy and they are getting old. If the FO prioritized winning over staying relavant over a long period of time (if they wanted to keep making money), then they would agree. You don't get championships by being a competitive team and staying complacent like the Blazers did for years.  ""Silly take. Marcus Thompson, who has connections with Curry/Draymond, just released an article saying our core wants to push for a trade for a star using draft assets.   You going to question their knowledge of the game? They don’t give a flying fuck about development prospects right now because it contradicts competing for a title.""  This was the original comment and it is clearly implying that the players words go above the FO's in terms of what to do with the assets. It's not what you're suggesting, it's what that guy was suggesting. You also completely shifted the topic when you said   ""Steph, Klay and Dray aren't specifically asking who to trade for and who to give up, they are leaving the specifics for the front office to decide, not hand picking who should join the team. They are simply encouraging the front office to have the attitude/openness to sacrifice future assets to get assets to win now""   This is because the original guy straight up said to push for a star and ignore the draft picks RIGHT NOW no matter who the draft is. That's not a mentality, that's specifics.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I understand that it is possible to have an immediate impact rookie, but I said they were usually unlikely. And apologies if my point wasn't clear from the start, but my main point is that it is a waste of a resource to try to get quick help from the draft as that is inefficient use of your assets. Drafting one should look and prioritize for potential, if they wanted immediate help its better to look for vets and etc. via free agency, not the draft.     Bro, they are not unlikely in the slightest, they are literally a category of rookies. Drafting a rookie for immediate help is not a bad use of assets because it's been done for like decades on decades, I'm pretty sure I'll take dozens of incredible GM's words over yours."
"The only positive asset is Klay Thompson yeah he had 2 horrible injuries back to back but he’s a player that relies very little on athleticism he’s still one of the greatest shooter the nba has ever seen  Tobias, KP, CJ, and Hayward are negative assets KP and Hayward being very injury prone and not playing anywhere near the contract they have Tobias and CJ are just very overpaid for what he brings to a team and more so CJ completely disappears at times  The rest are neutral assets good players that might have a large contract that most teams wouldn’t pay but still make your teams better"
**Bahamas Starting 5**:  C-Deandre Ayton  PF- Kai Jones  SF-Mychel Thompson  SG-Klay Thompson  PG-Buddy Hield   Would this lineup win a medal?
"Yeah, and this is why I am fine with being patient trading him. While he doesn't look great on our team, on a team like the Lakers or 76ers, Buddy would look like Klay Thompson."
"This same exact block of text was written in 2004.   &gt;Yeah you can argue they are not as stacked as they could be  Folks seem to gloss over this as though it's an afterthought but this is how it's been for decades now. If Team USA doesn't send the best of the best, things can get variably dicey.   Everyone was convinced the world had not only caught up to the USA, but perhaps even surpassed them in the mid-2000's. Then when USA got their minds right and actually sent the cavalry the next time out (2008), we got original Dream Team types of results.   Circumstances are different this year because so many stars are out with injuries (as opposed to just opting out like they did in the 2000's). But you can't leave these guys at home...  * LeBron James  * Stephen Curry  * Anthony Davis  * Klay Thompson  * Kyrie Irving  * James Harden  * Donovan Mitchell   * Paul George  * Kawhi Leonard  ... and then turn around and casually be like, ""I know we didn't send our best but still."" There's literally a Dream Team sitting home and for a long time now, when those guys aren't in the fold, nothing's a sure thing."
Klay Thompson looking good!
Kyrie Irvinf is drastically better than Klay thompson and Draynond green
"Steph curry, klay Thompson, draymond green, Kevin Durant, demarcus (boogie) cousins"
"Don’t forget demarcus (boogie) cousins. He was also on a team with steph curry, klay thompson, Dray, and kd"
"Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Tristian Thompson is about as good as Steph, Klay , and Dray"
lebron would make buddy hield look like klay thompson sheesh
"Flop, act generally entitled, has a face like a smushed Klay Thompson, rewarded the Suns in 4 guy for getting in an altercation, etc... It's not that serious though, I hate Booker as an enemy but I'm sure he's a fine person. It's sports bro, there players hated for way dumber reasons its just hard to see it when it's someone on your own team."
"Klay Thompson going nuclear vs other teams is box-office entertainment, you just know the man will pull the trigger no matter what coverage they try on him  Klay Thompson going nuclear vs *your team* is the single most terrifying thing in the universe"
Microwave scorers like Jordan Clarkson are fun to watch.      He won the Jazz many games last season and had some unbelievable take overs like his 41 points vs GSW with like 30 in the fourth and his 17 points in 2:30 against the Clippers in game 6.      Klay Thompson probably also fits this archetype.
Really glad they added (Thompson) or I would have had no idea which Klay they were talking about.
Klay Thompson? And we all have our opinions but I personally think Larry would be better. He’s just the better player and his game translates just as well to the modern league
He’d be very good. Like a better klay thompson but KD would still be better imo.
Klay Thompson??????
"Cause a lot of people already said kawhi,  Pete maravich, Klay Thompson, Dwight Howard"
"The last time Klay Thompson played when he was healthy was 29, now he's 31 and may not even play till he's 32 wtf"
Some of the fans think Klay Thompson is the difference between a 15-67 season and a 62-20 season and others think that he's done for. Not a lot of inbetween that I've seen in r/nba anyway
There’s also the Klay Thompson for Kevin Love deal that almost happened in 2014.
They didn't make the playoffs because they were rigged with injuries and played many guys that didn't know the system.   A respectable Klay Thompson + a 1-2 decent role players make the Warriors a contender.   Also Klay's value on that roster multiplies like a lot
Klay Thompson?  never. Not even coming off his current injuries.
"Didn’t learn until today that 3v3 half court basketball was an event, I would have LOVED to see a team comprised of NBA players.   Imagine Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson  What would your three be?"
"I don’t think it would be as bad of a fit as him on the lakers because of the spacing that curry and Thompson provide, Westbrook could drive and kick to an open curry or Klay teams are just gonna sag off on the 3pt line heavy on Draymond and Westbrook but he brings an extra added intensity to the team with Draymond also it’s not the best fit but I don’t think it’s as bad due to having Klay and curry"
He dominated this year because he’s that good. What kind of dumbass logic are you using. The dude grew up and was doin it without a super team. How could y’all but riders possibly act like having Steph curry and klay Thompson did not have anything to do with his play that year. Seriously dude.
"I’m thinking the compete opposite.  The Warriors will return back to championship form with Klay Thompson, and possibly a new addition."
Are we talking about Derrick Rose or Klay Thompson?
"What team would that trade make sense for?  They'd be trading away a superstar for a 30-year-old Klay Thompson who hadn't played in a year coming off an ACL tear and the 2nd pick in the draft?  A win now team wouldn't want the pick, and a rebuilding team wouldn't want an injured 30-year-old making 32-40 million a year for 4 years.  You can't just snap your fingers and make a trade happen in the NBA.  It doesn't work like that."
Right? We could’ve even got Klay Thompson
"&gt; That includes playing through injury like others teams have had to do. Lowry had an injured thumb that series as well.  Please tell me how Kevin Durant could've played through a torn Achilles and Klay Thompson through a torn ACL. You are comparing career threatening injuries to an injured thumb, really?  &gt; y your logic, there is no point in playing any games if all you're gonna go by is pre season predictions. Why bother playing 82 games and the post season when you already think gsw or lakers has it in the bag?  No, by my logic, if a team goes 82-0 in the regular season, sweeps their way to the Finals and then all get injured on their way to Game 1, there should be an asterisk attached to that season.  I will say it again, the asterisk exists so we know that the ACTUAL best team in the league lost due to unforeseen circumstances, the Golden State Warriors were BY FAR the best team in the league, they lost because they got hurt, plain and simple. This is not discrediting the Raptors, they won and god bless'em, but they were probably the third best team that year, Golden State eliminated the 2nd and injuries eliminated them."
Well we actually had an incredibly deep team before we got KD (worth it of course). And true but the Bucks lost Donte to injury while the Warriors lost KD and Klay Thompson. Bucks still had their 4 best players
"This is a great question.  I'll keep my answers to current players.  Players I'd take over Cade is Bam Adebayo (this assumes Bam doesn't get significantly better otherwise it would be an easy decision).  He isn't an all-nba level player but his defensive versatility and skillset is very rare and valuable in todays game.  Klay Thompson and Al Horford would also be my other choices.  I'd take Cade's potential over all-stars Draymond, Ingram, Derozan and Oladipo."
"From 2004 to 2021, almost every injury asterisk is for a player whose name starts with K:  2004: Karl Malone  2009: Kevin Garnett  2010: Kendrick Perkins  2015: Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving  2017: Kawhi Leonard  2019: Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant  2021: Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving"
Small ball itself is overrated. Its just a buzz term for people trying to copy the Warriors. But they don't have Steph Curry and Klay Thompson taking those threes. The superstar talent you have should dictate your style of play. Teams need to stop trying to fit square pegs into round holes.
"&gt;11 - Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler  Bump Kemba Walker for Nikola Vucevic for your starting 5.  Not saying Kemba is not as good as Vuc, but I am saying Kyrie, Klay, and Jimmy are better than Kemba and this lineup needs a big man, Vuc is a 2x all star."
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
"I can’t fault anyone for picking Russ due to Klay’s injury history the last two years, but it’s not like Russ is any younger (he’s older, actually), and Russ plays a much more demanding style of basketball, which puts a lot more wear and tear on his body. He’s not 100% free of injury concerns, either, and certainly didn’t look like himself when we last saw him this postseason.   I understand your point, but comparing MJ post-(second)retirement at age 40 vs. a soon-to-be 32 year old is a bit of a reach. Even if Klay is limited some as a defender, he still has the defensive IQ that will (most likely) allow him to be an effective defender as his body starts to decline. We’ve seen guys like Iguodala continue to be effective defenders well into their 30’s, and no offense to Russ, but his defense is what it is.   It’s not like Klay had much more of a role on offense than a glorified Kyle Korver; I think that, at worse, he returns to the court as a better Korver while being a plus defender. If I needed someone to carry my team, Russ is probably the answer (and probably would be, even if Klay was guaranteed to be 100%), but on a team that has its de facto leaders already, I’d personally prefer someone who doesn’t need the ball in their hands to be their best. I don’t mean any disrespect to Russ; its simply based off of my team’s current needs. Klay Thompson at 75% fits most (playoff) teams better than Russ does currently. If I’m missing out on playmaking, or a #1 guy, I’m taking Russ, but if I’m needing someone to be the third (or fourth) wheel, Klay seems to fit that mold better. If we had Bam, Russ, and Butler, we would *need* Klay Thompson out there with Duncan Robinson to have any kind of spacing."
mikal Thompson (klay dad) was a 1st round pick with a nice career but not 1st pick worthy
"&gt;As many championships and the greatest player in our franchise's history left after he was past his prime.  What? Wtf are you saying, yeah I know MJ left at 35 or whaetever. Bulls also got 6 rings from the GOAT. That was like 23 (Hah!) years ago, your team is NOT GOOD. You trying to flex on the Warriors for being relevant is like the Kings trying to flex on the Lakers for losing in the first round.  You and what, 80% of your fanbase statistically probably wasn't old enough to appreciate those Jordan years.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I'm sure Klay Thompson is the difference maker though. You'll get em next year.  Nah, Klay alone won't get us there. A key piece or two like Batum and K-Love, (Batum is linked with us and Dray is close with K-Love, plus we fit him better than the Nets) and ideally Mills (No rumours or links, just an appealing acquisition that's possible) should get us to where we want to be."
As many championships and the greatest player in our franchise's history left after he was past his prime.  I'm sure Klay Thompson is the difference maker though. You'll get em next year.
Great footage. Thanks ! It really help appreciate how good West was. Baylor and Chamberlain are clearly past their prime. But Jerry looks so fast and slippery with a sweet jumper and long hang time. He looks like a Tony Parker - Klay Thompson Dragon Ball fusion. He must have been a nightmare to guard.
"This may be my inner nephew, but why would GSW trade for Beal or Lillard when they have probably the best back court outside mayyyyyybe Brooklyn, unless Thompson doesnt come back soon. Actually want to know, please comment  Edit: I know Klay has an ACL, but he is meant to come back this season right?"
"&gt; if he returns a lot worse he'd prob be a top 30-40 player  You dropped a lot of hot takes in this thread but by far my favorite is you thinking Klay has **only** this far to drop off if his play takes a dive next season.  Lebron  Durant  Curry  Harden  Jokic  Kawhi  Embiid  Dame  Giannis  Luka  Davis  Booker  Gobert  Kyrie Tatum  George  Beal  CP3  Butler  KAT  Zion  Trae  Middleton  Ayton  Simmons  Randle  Bam  Brown  Mitchell  Lavine  Harris  Murray  Sabonis  Holiday  Morant  Derozan  Fox  Siakim  Ingram  Vucevic  Westbrook   ~40 names roughly sorted off the top of my head. Just for the sake of argument I'll put Westbrook at 41, cause I would love to see what other 10 players on this list you could justify placing an **unhealthy** Klay Thompson above?"
"because it’s klay thompson, this subs golden bong boy"
"Michael Jordan, Zach Lavine, Ray Allen, Stephon Marbury, Tyler Hansboro, Emeka Okafor, Mario Chalmers, Paul Pierce, Dwight Howard, Klay Thompson."
Klay shot still gone be there  But you aren’t getting Klay Thompson anymore
Wiggins was spotted sitting with James Wiseman sitting at the social outcast table in the warriors cafeteria while Klay Thompson reportedly was handing out invites on a team boat ride without them.
Last year’s team didn’t have Klay Thompson.
&gt;I was more referring to adding a Klay Thompson in Steve Kerr  I'm sorry but Steve Kerr was never fucking Klay Thompson...wtf?
Best perimeter defender? You badly misspelled Klay Thompson
You heard that in 2016 when the reigning scoring champ recruited a multiple time scoring champ to join himself and Klay Thompson. It was wildly successful.
"&gt;Some on the Golden State Warriors are watching closely the next move of Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal. Should he become available, he’s at the top of the offseason wishlist.  &gt;The Warriors’ trio of stars — Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson — have made it clear to management they want the franchise to focus on the pursuit of a championship, even to consider using their two lottery picks to get someone who can help immediately, sources confirmed. Warriors general manager Bob Myers said their goal this offseason is to add more of a veteran presence.  &gt;Should the Warriors go that route, Beal, the Washington Wizards’ guard who made third-team All-NBA, is deemed to be the best player and best fit for the Warriors among the players who could potentially be available this offseason.  &gt;Of course, “available” is the operative word. Beal to this point, publicly, has held firm in his stance he would not request a trade from the Wizards. He has two years left on his deal worth $71.8 million, including a $37.3 million player option for 2022-23. So Washington really only has team control for one more season and, after hiring Wes Unseld Jr. as their new head coach, might be ripe for a slower rebuild.  &gt;Beal attended Team USA camp in Las Vegas along with Green and Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who is an assistant coach for the Olympic men’s basketball team. Beal did not travel to Tokyo after being placed in health and safety protocols.  &gt;Blazers guard Damian Lillard, who has been rumored to be unhappy with Portland and a threat to demand a trade, was another desired player if he were to become available. But Lillard has clarified he has not demanded a trade and multiple sources said the Warriors don’t suspect Lillard would want to come to the Bay.  &gt;The interest in Beal (and Lillard) underscores the prioritizing of another reliable offensive creator. Golden State had the 20th-ranked offense even with Curry averaging a career-high 32 points on 48.2 percent shooting.  &gt;Beal, who finished runner up to Curry for the scoring title, would significantly bolster the talent and explosiveness on the roster. He’s a preferred target over the Raptors’ Pascal Siakam, who has been a rumored option for Golden State. Beal would give the Warriors shooting and another offensive creator — two elements they need badly to take the pressure off Curry. One of the best scorers in the league, Beal can also carry the team should Curry have to miss some time.  &gt;At 6-foot-3 and reputed as a subpar defender, Beal doesn’t fit the Warriors’ typical mold for an NBA off guard. But his strength and physicality create some hope Beal could contribute on defense if he bought in on that end of the floor. Undoubtedly, some of the optimism comes from the strides Andrew Wiggins made in a defense anchored by Green.  &gt;Beal could only be acquired through a trade, which was expected by many during the trade deadline earlier this year. But Beal reiterated his intentions to stay with Washington, and the Wizards rallied to make the playoffs as the No. 8 seed, losing in the first round to Philadelphia in five games.  &gt;If Beal to the Warriors is even possible, it would likely have to happen before next week’s draft. The Warriors’ No. 7 and No. 14 picks would almost assuredly be included in a package for Beal. Golden State would likely have to add a future pick as well. The clear preference for the Warriors’ veterans — Curry is 33 years old, Green and Thompson are both 31— is to go all-in for these next few years instead of restocking the regular roster with players who could take years to develop.  &gt;Any deal involving Beal would have to include Andrew Wiggins to make the salaries match. Wiggins has two years, $65.2 million remaining on his contract. One team source did say the Warriors wouldn’t be quite willing to gut the roster to acquire Beal. If they could land Beal while keeping James Wiseman, it could be the best of both worlds for the Warriors — appease the desire to win now while retaining a future centerpiece. But Washington figures to want Wiseman.  &gt;The Warriors are expecting to get Thompson back after two years missed due to injuries. But after sustaining a torn right ACL in 2019 and a torn left Achilles in 2020, it is unknown at what level Thompson will be when he returns. Kevin Durant’s ability to play at a high level coming off an Achilles injury allows for some confidence in Thompson’s return, but just his presence would be much-needed help for Curry, who put up an MVP-caliber season on a team with inexperienced players in key positions.  &gt;Golden State went 2-7 in the nine games Curry missed, which landed them in the play-in tournament where they were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies. The Warriors had a .587 win percentage in games Curry played. A .583 win percentage was good for a three-way tie for the No. 5 seed in the West.  &gt;Barring a seemingly improbable trade for a star, the Warriors’ options are to use the picks and hope to land a player who can be a contributor by season’s end, then use free agency to fill gaps with veteran talent. The Warriors have the taxpayer mid-level exception and veteran minimum exceptions to use. They also have the option of finding a sign-and-trade partner for Kelly Oubre Jr., a free agent who isn’t expected to return to the Warriors."
"Imagine the Warriors have the two highest scoring players in the league, **and Klay Thompson**. Unstoppable.  I wonder where I’ve heard that story before"
Mike Conley  Klay Thompson  Giannis  Tacko  Boban  Spacing would be horrible in the front court but defense would be solid.
&gt; Pippin was drafted by the Sonics.  Yea and Kawhi was drafted by the Pacers. Doesn't mean anything  &gt;I was more referring to adding a Klay Thompson in Steve Kerr  bro what. Steve Kerr is more like Danny Green or something not Klay  &gt;and a Draymond Green in Dennis Rodman.  they already had three titles by then  Also add my friend Horace Grant to the drafted by the Bulls list.
"Pippin was drafted by the Sonics. I was more referring to adding a Klay Thompson in Steve Kerr, and a Draymond Green in Dennis Rodman."
"that's good drafting. makes up a little for bennett and wiggins  edit:  well they could've picked better than thompson, looking at this again. i know not all of these guys stood out back then, but they did pass on klay, both morris twins, kawhi, vuc, harris, butler, and bogdan"
"I don’t think anyone in the league hates Giannis, kinda like Klay Thompson. They’re just likeable guys. I bet suns fans are happy for Giannis too"
Murray and Klay Thompson.
Is u/ProudStephew actually Klay Thompson?
Kevin Huerter is truly Klay Thompson
WHAT?!?!!?  You’re not putting Luka over Klay fucking Thompson. Does you’re own example not show you how patently insane this is????  Who decides “how it works”? Why are they an idiot?  My head hurts  The better player is better…. It’s not hard
"You can think it’s stupid, that’s just how all time lists work. I’m not putting Luka over guys like Klay Thompson or Paul Pierce all time, even though he is better than they were at their best."
Talen Horton-Tucker and Wes Matthews for Klay Thompson
Robert Covington ----&gt; Trevor Ariza ------&gt; Klay Thompson (all in their primes)
"Your predictions arent really bold predictions.  Minnesota ends up being Top 4 in the West - DLo, Edwards and KAT -  BIG 3  Suns dont make the playoffs, Booker requests for a trade halway through the season  Ben Simmons gets traded to Miami  Klay Thompson Highest PPG   CP3 retires"
It's also A LOT easier to beat a team with a duo of Booker and old as CP3 than say...Steph Curry Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant lol chill out there young fella
Korver=Klay  KD=Tristan Thompson because both went to Texas
Cmon man I know he’s been injured but give Klay Thompson some respect
"There’s a difference between having Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh as your other 2 guys, or Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson as your 2 guys (3 with draymond even) than…. Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton. How are you gonna say that good team building is a “super team”?"
Idk man. He's definitely gonna improve and be a better player. I just don't see him becoming one of the great SGs of this league. There's just something missing.  Ive been watching NBA since the days of Pete maravich. I'm an old dude. There is this spark you feel from future HOFers. Two guys currently who don't give me this are Klay Thompson and Devin Booker. They will become HOFers. It just seems like their game ain't explosive. Idk maybe im wrong
"No but they had 73 damn wins and unanimous MVP Steph Curry alongside DPOY Draymond Green and all time great sharpshooter Klay Thompson. Also had Iguodala, one of the great defenders of the modern era along with a bench unit that was far superior to the list of vet minimum guys the 2011 Heat cobbled together. Oh and did I mention they won a chip the year before?"
Unlike klay Thompson.
"there are very few guys who have this attitude and then stuck with it instead of taking the eaiser route. he could have easily demanded a trade and sign to play with someone like curry who hes really good friends with but he was a man to his word.  also how can you not love this guy, the only guy who is an acceptable answer to like more is klay thompson....all other responses are wrong"
then Khris “Black Klay Thompson” Middleton
Sometimes Booker looks like Klay Thompson JR and sometimes he looks pedestrian
any chance we could see klay thompson on this bucks team?
"**In order:** Jamal Crawford, Pau Gasol, Amare Stoudemire, Bron, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Steph Curry, Paul George, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Giannis, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown 🍀, Jayson Tatum 🍀, Luka Doncic, Zion, Lamelo.   **Honorable mentions:** '01 Tony Parker, '04 Andre Iguodala, '06 LaMarcus Aldridge, '08 Russell Westbrook, '11 Kyrie Irving.  It's funny my honorable mentions stopped at 2011 and didn't continue. Those are all the guys i almost picked over ny final pick for that year.  Tony Parker was a fantastic cerebral PG who won several championships with San Antonio. I went with Paul Gasol because he was one of the best 4s in the game and played at a star level alongside Kobe Bryant. That says alot.   Andre Iguodala was always a really good 2-way player and enjoyed a long, healthy career. But people forget how incredible Dwight Howard was. 4x DPOY, explosive athlete who managed to lead his mediocre Magic team past Lebron's slightly worse Cavs team.  It's a shame that both of my picks for '06 were guys that would end up having health problems. Although Aldridge had a much longer career, he was in the league for many years with a heart condition. Long story short, he is lucky to be with us today.  Derrick Rose was *not* by my knowledge ever an injury concern. But what I do know is that his intangibles blow Westbrook's away, and assuming both could've stayed healthy, I'd trust a Rose-led team over a Westbrook-led one any day (except maybe prime OKC...)  Klay Thompson is extremely underrated because he shares the court with the best shooter we've ever seen, but Klay is a fantastic 2-way player who can not only heat up with some of the greatest scorers ever, he also frequently gets the assignment of guarding the opponent's best perimeter or wing player because he can clamp them down. Also team chemistry."
"Klay thompson tier, but a little bit worse (?)"
Jeff Hornacek should be up there. He’s one of the best pure shooters ever and it’s a crime he never had a coach that told him to just jack it up. Today he could be like a Klay Thompson that could playmake and get to the line
"Yeah, but that happens a lot when people play with other superstars.  In a previous post, I said that Ron Harper was a better overall player than Klay Thompson is at the same points in their careers. I meant what I said and the stats back that up. Thompson was slightly better as a scorer. Harper was a vastly better basketball player at literally everything else.  Being a 21 ppg scorer and a defensive liability means you aren't a top 100 career player, much less top 75.  So why wasn't Harper lauded that highly?  Three reasons: he had a knee injury that limited his athleticism in a time where an ACL tear could end your career, he played during an era where all-star selections were pegged to your position, and he won his rings with Michael Jordan.  The dude was literally billed as ""a poor man's Michael Jordan"" before he got hurt and averaged 20/5/5.  Harper's PPG dropped 13 points when he went to the Bulls.  Phil Jackson told him that he was not expected to score much, and for his focus to be everywhere else on the floor.  He settled into his role and did his job.  He was very important to the second set of Bulls' title runs."

"Small tangent, but that’s why third banana Klay Thompson arrogantly claiming he deserved to be on the list really rubbed me wrong. I know he’s a beloved internet meme, but this and the LeBron comment during the 16 (I think) Finals really make me not a fan."
What's the record for 3-point attempts by a single player in a game? The most I could find was 24 by Klay Thompson.
That was a Klay Thompson-esque three 😳
On a roster with Otto Porter and Klay Thompson? Alright bro...
Klay Thompson might be a good fit
KD has an MVP and finals appearance without Klay fuckin Thompson LMAO
This deep ass team is adding Klay Thompson and James Wiseman
Just remember this team will soon be adding Klay Thompson 🙀
“SUCK MY COCK I’LL MURDER YOUR FAMILY!” - Klay “Jackie Moon” Thompson
Oh yes klay Thompson the absolute best SG in the world
"Ah yes, best in the world Klay Thompson."
You clearly don’t watch the nuggets. He had an off night but he usually is money from anywhere. Contested or not. He has klay Thompson green light for shooting 3s his shot is that wet
If anyone can catch Kobe it’s Klay Thompson
"The Warriors went with Steph Curry, who had never averaged 25 ppg in a season, Klay Thompson who has no ball handling skills, and Draymond Green who has the scoring potency of a donkey and won a championship and dominated the league. While getting rid of David Lee who was a very very good offensive player at the PF position. All by getting a new coach. The talent of the Warriors in 2015 and 2016 wasn't all that impressive. Guess what, the Duncan Spurs weren't all that talented either. Just coached well.  Yes, coaching schemes matter, considerably. A first round exit and pretender turned contender over one off-season and one coaching change.   Damian Lillard is the 2nd best deep range threat in the league today. And since when have you ever seen him run around screens or pin downs? The Blazers offense is literally to just work through Damian. Didn't work then. Still won't work now when they go up against strong defensive teams.   Didn't work for the Warriors in 2014.  Never worked for James Harden.  Didn't work for Russ.  Didn't work for MJ until Phil Jackson was hired."
"Sure but wasn’t klay Thompson injured for the warriors. It was pretty much just him versus steph, no?"
"Klay Thompson talent, Tristan Thompson brain."
"Hey well I suppose it’s better than Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green teaming up to destroy everyone? Lol."
Klay Thompson like
"If PG is the first or second best player on a team, they aren't going to win a championship. He's not reliable in the playoffs as a scorer and not good enough a playmaker to be a main option for a team that wants to win. If he played a Klay Thompson-esque role for the Clippers, then they might have something cooking."
"You mean Jabari ""Six-foot-nine Ray Allen"" Parker and Aaron ""The Young Klay Thompson"" Nesmith?"
"""The Nets are in talks with the Warriors to send Kyrie and James Harden to GS in return for Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, an Draymond Green."""
Rondo turning into Klay Thompson there for a minute was pretty scary.
"I never said he wasn’t the best player on that team, but you’re acting like he carried that team which is extremely untrue. That was a team win if there’s ever been a team win. FVV bailed his ass out a few times with clutch ass 3s and good rough defense on Steph. That year the Warriors sacrificed depth for an unbeatable starting 5, losing Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson is NOT comparable to losing Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. Especially when there’s no depth because you have 4 stars eating up cap space."
"That's the Sixers playing 4D chess. Let than man go 4/4 in the first quarter last time we played, now he thinks he's Klay Thompson./s"
Kinda wanted to see the Heat pull a Klay Thompson third quarter and just find Duncan Robinson every play.
He's phenomenal but Klay Thompson exists
Duncan is the new Klay Thompson what the fuuck
You can give Steph props without dumb hypotheticals like this lmao.   The Thunder within SGA had a worse record. And they didn’t also have a Klay Thompson on the bench.
He should still look like old Klay Thompson tbh his appearance hasn’t changed much aside from a beard
"Once Klay Thompson comes back, there won't be any more double teaming Curry."
I feel like this comment will age like a fine Klay Thompson-promoted Vitamin D milk.
The difference between klay and Boogie is that Boogie is a big man who relied on his legs a lot in the paint for post ups put back dunks blocks and things like that Klay Thompson is a spot up shooter he hardly dribbles the ball at all so the injuries he had really won’t affect him as much as he doesn’t rely on his legs to explode klay is going to be back and klay is going to be klay
"His shot is never coming back after the hip surgery in 2016.   I think they can still compete though with his current offensive game, its just tough to win games when you have a max player and your second best player tear his Achilles on draft night.    Soo many games this year, including both play-ins were a mediocre Klay Thompson performance away from a win."
He was terrible in the short roll this game and has been when teams trap Curry with playoff intensity. Kicking it to the feet of a corner shooter doesn’t cut it unless that shooter is Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant. His defense is championship material though.
He’s basically making the case for Klay Thompson as MVP next year. He’s probably right.
He’s gonna get Klay Thompson back and not have to pass out of triple teams anymore is what he’s gonna do.
Ikr. Peja was Klay Thompson before Klay Thompson. It's true he was past his prime in 2011 but he was hitting clutch 3s as part of the second unit in the Play-offs and was super experienced.
Gotta be Klay Thompson
"I mean Steph doesn’t pick his teammates. What can he do? Besides deal w/ what hand was dealt.  FO tried to find a Klay Thompson replacement in Wiggins and Oubre and didn’t deliver. No one was going to replace to exact production but still, it’s a FO fail more than anything  Not even a Warriors apologist just a objective basketball fan"
"Huh, I wonder if missing a top 5 3 and D guy of all time for the past two seasons due to injuries had anything to do with that?  Nah, Klay Thompson is just a modern day Pippen, no way would he have that level of impact on a team (a real take I've heard)."
"Klay Thompson alone coming back isn’t taking the Warriors from out of the playoffs to title contender. Wiggins needs two play at an All-Star level and Wiseman needs to turn into David Robinson. Dubs are old, creaky, and have missed the playoffs two years straight. I think their title opportunities are over no matter how well Steph plays."
"&gt;Even LAL with key injuries to Lebron/AD fell to 7.   Yea, and that's the point. Their injuries were even worse and still were ahead of the Dubs by several games. Not just Bron and AD, but Schroder, Kuz, Gasol, Caruso, Wes Matthews and pretty much every valuable rotation player for the Lakers got injured  &gt;Warriors maintained 8 seed (reg season now, i guess?) with Curry and Dray missing games, Wiseman missing a GOOD chunk of the season, and I mean, Lebron doesn’t hit that crazy 3 and Warriors might have hit 7 seed.  Wiseman hurt the team, Dubs fans have said this unanimously. He's a literal net negative and him coming back is lowering their record  &gt;The west is stacked. It will be for awhile. But Dray at DPOY level this year, Steph having maybe his best year ever and an MVP level year, with Klay Thompson? Yes. They’re hitting top 4.   Klay Thompson post ACL &amp; Achilles, and with everyone else one year older. I don't see Top 4  &gt;They weren’t even THAT far out with all the shit they had to go through.  Warriors were 8 games back from the 4 seed.  &gt;Klay likely won’t be the Klay we all knew, but he 100% makes the Warriors a better team when Steph did all he did this year as really the only offensive threat on the entire court 100% of the time.  True, but I see at least 5 teams def better, and 2 probably better. Lakers, Clips, Suns, Jazz, Nuggets def better and probably Mavs and Blazers. All these teams had real bad COVID/injury luck too, outside of Phoenix  I don't see Dubs top 4"
He's a great defender. But not every great defender can make an all-defensive team. Just look at Klay Thompson. Only 1 selection and look how long it took for him to get it  It doesn't help that a lot of the time players are selected based off reputation instead of production. If this is the defender Brooks is going to be for his career he'll get there
"Even LAL with key injuries to Lebron/AD fell to 7. Warriors maintained 8 seed (reg season now, i guess?) with Curry and Dray missing games, Wiseman missing a GOOD chunk of the season, and I mean, Lebron doesn’t hit that crazy 3 and Warriors might have hit 7 seed.  The west is stacked. It will be for awhile. But Dray at DPOY level this year, Steph having maybe his best year ever and an MVP level year, with Klay Thompson? Yes. They’re hitting top 4. They weren’t even THAT far out with all the shit they had to go through. Klay likely won’t be the Klay we all knew, but he 100% makes the Warriors a better team when Steph did all he did this year as really the only offensive threat on the entire court 100% of the time."
"I agree about Curry choking, and that he needs to catch more criticism for his 0/10 record on playoff game winners, but also remember that it's not just ""without KD"" it's ""without KD AND Klay Thompson"" Klay had a HUGE impact on every finals from 2015-2019 and his absence in the lineup is felt debatably more than KD considering that Thompson was an All-Defensive team selection, KD doesn't have the impact that Klay does on the other end of the floor"
"Draymond complaining about the lack of veteran players for Steph is about as dumb as his shot at the end of the 4th. Klay is hurt at $35 million, Steph at $43 million, Wiggins $30 million, and Green at $22 million, and Oubre at $14 million are already $12 million over the taxpayer cap and that’s without Wiseman and a bunch of low-paid guys.  Lacob may not care about the tax, but it’s the lack of roster flexibility being that far over the cap hinders the Dubs this offseason.   Okay Thompson returning alone isn’t going to make GS a contender next year. Cray summer for the Warriors because this is a flawed roster even when Klay gets back after missing almost two years."
Some big changes coming to GS. This Warriors team is not a Klay Thompson away from becoming a contender.
Hopefully we can all watch some healthy Klay Thompson next season!
"Lol the dude had 13 turnovers in the last two games. Blaming it on Wiggins wow how original. Maybe Steph, Dray, and the Warriors just aren’t as good without Klay Thompson?  Also if you’re that careless with the ball you aren’t winning shit."
[It irks him too.](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/06/23/stephen-curry-regrets-behind-the-back-pass-to-klay-thompson-in-game-7-of-2016-finals/)
Welcome to Damian Lillard's existence the last 8 years. Life is tough when you don't have KD and Klay Thompson to pick from to pass the ball to when you get trapped.
"The nearly non-existent Curry MVP buzz dying to Grayson Allen getting hot, lol.  Klay Thompson ain't going to fix this."
I hope Klay Thompson comes back 100% next year. It's painful to watch Curry get triple teamed because everyone else sucks
"Klay Thompson, you are missed."
Klay Thompson tore his Achilles tendon.
Klay Thompson tore his Achilles
Curry showing he can’t win without Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant.
I mean they are starting Kent Bazemore instead of Klay Thompson. That’s the biggest problem
"""Help us Klay Thompson, you're our only hope""  -Some Warriors fans probably"
Klay Thompson is about to come off the bench in a dramatic anime-like fashion &amp; drop 7 3’s to save the game.
Like one Klay Thompson?
They're killing Klay Thompson.
I think someone like Klay Thompson would fit in well next to curry
Klay Thompson = The Human Highlighter
Klay thompson got no drip
MVP - Klay Thompson  DPOY - Trae Young  6MOTY - Aron Baynes  ROY - James Wiseman  MIP - Kelly Oubre  COY - Luke Walton  JWK Citizenship Award - Meyers Leonard
"Absolutely. MJ (GOAT or arguable GOAT), Pippen (top 50 player/a GOAT wing defender), Rodman (one of the GOAT rebounder/defender), Kukoc (swiss army knife 6th man), and Phil Jackson (arguable GOAT coach at best/top 3 coach at worst).  This was a time where not many teams even had 2 top 20 players in the league, much less top 10. The Bulls arguably had 2 of the top 5 players. The only other teams were Orlando (Shaq/Penny), Seattle (Payton/Kemp), and Utah (Stockton/Malone). Houston had an old and aging Big 3 with Hakeem, Drexler, and Barkley but they got swept by Seattle.  The Knicks were built around one superstar in Patrick Ewing (who's second banana was John Starks). The Pacers were built around one star in Reggie Miller (that's like building around Klay Thompson today). Those teams were good but nothing compared to today's league where you need 2 all-stars at minimum to even think about contending. A team with a John Starks type as their 2nd best player wouldn't make the playoffs."
Klay Thompson 2015   Hot take but the dude was garbage for about half the postseason (Elite 2016-2019)  Honestly it was just the finals were he sucked
Yup but fun fact there was another guy in the NBA named Mychel Thompson who’s only 1 degree away from Klay! I believe the connection was Omri Casspi. I was specifically looking for father/son duos who were 1 degree away.
"I think you need a Jokic team defensively. You need big defenders around him to help.  On the other hand, Davis can be the only big and the team defense won't suffer.  This makes me think of like Klay Thompson vs LaVine. If you want someone to run your offense, you pick LaVine. If you want someone to fit next to anyone, you want Klay."
I mean I could see a contender where prime Klay Thompson is the #1 scoring option if you have great defenders around you. Doesn’t mean that either is top 5
Mychal Thompson is only 2 from Klay.   Mychal - Elden Campbell - Richard Jefferson - Klay
"Draymond Green’s importance to that team is always underplayed. If he’s not on that team, they get worse in literally every aspect of the game. The ball won’t move as much on offense. Transition offense gets sloppier. Every player on the team who isn’t Klay Thompson get’s worse on defense. They’ll simply score less and give up more points, straight up.  I don’t think it’s a fluke that everyone on the coaching staff and front office that get’s interviewed says that they’re not winning a championship if they don’t have Draymond Green on the team."
10 Teammates separate the first man to ever score a point in the NBA and the most recent person ever to score a point in the NBA   Ossie schectman (first NBA basket) --&gt; Bud Palmer --&gt; Carl Braun --&gt; Bill Russell --&gt; Don Chaney --&gt; Mychal Thompson --&gt; Byron Scott --&gt; Reggie Miller --&gt; Jermaine O'Neal --&gt; Klay Thompson --&gt; Justin Holiday --&gt; Cassius Stanley (Last points in the IND/WAS game)
"Have you heard of Klay Thompson, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre, Damion Lee and Marquee Chriss. All hurt this season."
How many degrees of separation between Klay Thompson and Magnus Carlsen tho?
"Because the most valuable player makes his team better too, like Steph did in 15 and 16.  Remove Steph from the warriors teams and we probably wouldn’t give a shit about klay thompson or Draymond green"
"The (current) Bucks are basically hoping to outshoot their opponents on each and every game. And yes their offense is clearly better. However neither Portis, nor Forbes add anything defensively. Maybe P.J. Tucker does add to their defense, then again I trust in Bud to heavily misusing him and playing him alongside Lopez ... because why not? I have a switchable small ball C? Why not play him alongside the most unswitchable player in the modern game? Basically negate his superpower (defensively) by asking him to basically chase players?  So, yeah, obviously if the Heat go on a run (oh and they will) and the Bucks go to even bigger runs, the Bucks win. However if you are hoping to outshoot each and every opponent in your way to the trophy ... good luck.  In fact I'm doubter of the Nets even, who are even better at this style of basketball (""let them go in a run, we will run even faster"" type of nonsense) . Things that you think may work , don't in the playoffs. There the rules are different. The Lakers basically mangled those hapless Warriors to submission. The amount of ""missed"" calls were incredible. I sometimes joke that playoff basketball has more football in it than it has regular season basketball.  I wanna see Forbes and Portis shooting 45% when driven out of the court because the refs refuse to call the same things they do in the regular season. Shooting teams get roughed up in the post season ... Always. The Warriors ultimately won because on top of being a shooting (super)team they were also tough defensively and very switchable. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green were taking everything away (and Iggy earlier on). You *need* that, goonery. You won't go to the finals prancing like a princess. And yes the Bucks have goons of their own (defensively), however they are greatly misused by Bud's system. He puts no bodies in the perimeter, they are always chasing the shooter, like always. Those are NBA players, they don't need much to get hot. Leaving 3+ ft to shooters (consistently) is a recipe for disaster. Suddenly players like Duncan Robinson would look like superheroes on your a$$, all the while your very shooters would be roughed up on the other end (before even they are in a position to the get the ball), because Spoelstra has Bud's numbers.  So yes, better personel. The Bucks are blessed to have so many good players at once. Despite lacking a legit No2. They have 2-3 no 3s, and some good 4s and 5s. Not many teams can have that. Still.not.enough against good teams.  Even if you win over the Heat (on talent alone) then you get the Nets next. Without outwitting *them* you are a second round exit (and you will be that in your best case scenario)."
By my count that’s 4 more games than Klay Thompson.
"It just sounds so stupid to say, ""If Klay Thompson is healthy, Steph wins MVP.""   Because that is basically what it means to say you can't give a player on an 8th seed the mvp without his second best player all year."
Klay Thompson even hobbled
And I love that you start Klay Thompson over Larry Bird. You clearly do not know basketball.
"Because he looks like pre championship Curry again with the new haircut and old warrior jerseys. Its a little bit of nostalgia, also hes the scoring champ, also his team has been winning a lot with several not well-known players, and no Klay Thompson"
"Not talking shit, I just don’t realistically see how this Laker showing relates to them being favored over the Nets. The dubs can put up a very decent fight despite not having Klay Thompson. I have zero faith that this version of the warriors could take the Nets in a 7 game series."
"Draymond Green is definitely the Dennis Rhodman for the Warriors (albeit not as weird) which actually helps Steph and Klay as he can take much of the hate away from them. I think another reason Steph, and the Warriors in general are like better than Lebron's team, in this case the Lakers, is because it is organic. The Big 3 of the Warriors, were drafted by the Warriors. Steph, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green have grown through their careers on the same team, and together. It's natural. Its organic. Despite being a big 3, it's not like others. They got a lot of hate when they signed KD, but KD absorbed a lot of hate, as you said. So, if the Warriors say, win another championship once Klay is healthy, a lot of people will probably be rooting for them. People don't love the Lebron style of leave when things get tough, and form a super team in your next destination. I don't think any athletes image has changed as much as Lebron's after the infamous 'Decision' to go to Miami."
"Switch Anthony Davis with Dryamond Green, or throw Klay Thompson back in, and we'll see who daddy is.  Edit: Or drop both anthony davis and draymond green and we will see who daddy is."
I know better than to post up Klay Thompson
It was so bizarre to see something like this in the field of sports and I guess Sports Icon is really a great way to push mass adoption as well. I will wait for the Klay Thompson collectibles once they make it happen soon. I'm hoping...
"So glad we won.   My Takeaways:  - 36y/o still showing he's the best player in the league is goddamn impressive. Also NGL some acting skills involved especially on that charge that was overturned that was pretty lull, but he legit got poked in the eye.  - Curry's ability to hit shots is goddamn scary but I was actually surprised at how much Wes and the child of Erneh managed to cause him to fumble. His handle was questionable, and this isn't the first time in the playoffs its been questionable. IMO trying to go through the double team every time doesn't work against good D like ours and the 6 TO's (altho 1 was just a pass drop by TA) were how we got back in it. This all goes away with Klay Thompson back I guess but MEM with Brooks might be a real problem for GSW if they watch tape.  - Draymond Green is really really really good, he made some Westbrook like shitty passes on back-cuts but damn he disrupted our entire offensive scheme every other time.  - AD still looks way off, I don't think PHX will give us much trouble due to how we match up, but this version of AD not gonna do it vs LAC.   - Obv Biased but I thought Ref's were pretty good. This level of ""letting em play"" tho favors us a bit just cause of our aggressive our D is.  Glad we got the extra rest."
"Which I guess I am fine with, as much as I love Curry -- Lakers and Memphis are better, deeper teams, and I'm actually really interested to see what the Grizz can do against Utah. I think they're a million times better equipped to handle them than GS is.   This Warriors team is a lot more than just Klay Thompson from being legit contenders. Interesting to see if they go all-in on trying to get another ring from their most famous draft trio."
"No I just am saying how the Lakers bent their defense a lot more to stop Curry than the Warriors bent theirs to stop LeBron.  That bending of the defense leaves openings all over the court, however the Warriors shambled roster wasn't able to take advantage of it well enough, which is the reason it's a viable strategy in the first place.  Had Anthony Davis been one of Curry's teammates; he would've been getting a LOT of free dunks out there (which would not show on the stat sheets as assists for Steph despite creating them btw). If Klay Thompson is out there, that's a lot of wide open threes.   Unfortunately it is JTA, Jordan poole, Kevon looney, Kent Bazemore, Wiggins trying to finish those opportunities. They were almost able to do enough but not quite"
that's a klay thompson move
I’ve been waiting two fucking years for Klay Thompson to return and I can’t wait to see what he and Steph do next season.   I’m so bored by teams like LA buying championships. Make it stop
The warriors doing this without Klay Thompson is crazy
Warriors woulda won by 25 if they had klay Thompson
Would've been Klay Thompson taking that wide open 3
they didnt have klay thompson. the 2nd best player on their team
When did Bazemore turn into Klay Thompson?
"as a rockets fan, watching steph get landing spot fouls while klay thompson could just tackle harden in the open field pisses me off."
You let Klay Thompson into space jam and you thought he wouldn’t do any behind the lines scouting for the dubs 🤨🤨
Lebron come play with your costar klay Thompson next year on a vet minimum
One klay Thompson away.
Keep waiting for Warriors to pull the Klay Thompson strat that one user on here came up with. I know they’ll use it. It’s too good not to.
Lakers daring anyone except Klay Thompson to beat them
No disrespect to the Warriors but I'd much rather have the Suns face a warriors team without Klay Thompson in the first round than the fucking Lakers who seem to be finally healthy. Go Dubs!

"Note I said fully healthy, as in a 100% Klay Thompson. I don’t consider that homerism given their history."
"Oubre, Lee, Paschall, Steph, Looney. I didn’t even mention Klay Thompson.   There were times the Warriors were running 7-8 man rosters with 2 unplayable players (Smiley and Mannion.) Warriors saw plenty of injuries."
"If Klay Thompson was playing this game, yes I’d pick the Warriors"
"The problem is our defense falls severely with trading Wiggins, the young players are depth and losing 2-4 depth pieces would suck. But Wiggins, like you said is our #1 defender and unlike Simmons can impact an our offense for the positive. It would be preferable to keep Wiggins in a trade and rock with a Curry/Dame/Thompson/Wiggins/Dray which isn’t easy on Klay still as he’s gonna be guarding PFs most likely. We’d be the Nets, trying to outscore everybody. It might work but we might become the new and improved Blazers with our guard height and heck, height as a unit just getting shot over. We can take the risk but we would be wagering about the last half of this decade on it. Is it worth it to see the most amazing 3 point offense of all time? Maybe"

"I'm just going to assume that people who say ""Never got the hate about Kuzma"" didn't see his tweet about Klay.  https://thespun.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/kyle-kuzma-is-getting-crushed-for-his-tweet-about-klay-thompson"
I literally thought you meant you looked over at his penis and deduced it was Klay Thompson.
"Grayson is a very good defender. He’s a more physical, brute Klay Thompson"
We peed next to eachother in an airport bathroom a few years ago. I just looked over and said “ah shit you’re klay Thompson” and he just went “m yep” and walked away. Pretty chill.
"at different times I was surprised to find out thatJason Kidd, Steph curry, Blake Griffin, Klay Thompson, and Devin Booker were black.  I guess I just never really thought about it too hard until someone pointed it out"
"Pros for Embiid: - better offensive player in isolation - better post defender - slightly better shooter  Pros for AD: - better P&amp;R defender - better perimeter defender on switches - slightly better roll man   So it kinda depends on the roster around them.  If either of these players is the best player on their team I'd much rather have a healthy Embiid, who can probably be the best player on a championship team. I'm still not 100% sold AD can be that, even though he's obviously a great player.  If you have a great perimeter player (especially a P&amp;R ball-handler) with them, then I'd rather have AD. He's a better complimentary player to a heliocentric center-piece player.  I actually think this is somewhat similar to the Klay Thompson/James Harden debate from the 2015-2017 time frame. A lot of numbers point to Harden, but there was a good argument for Klay on a lot of teams that already have a centerpiece because of off-ball scoring and defense."

"We’re not talking about right now though. We’re talking about playing with different hand checking and holding leniency in older eras. I’ve never seen an off ball championship level #1 superstar. In fact, some could argue Curry’s inability to create with the ball in his hands in the finals is why he’s never won a finals mvp. The way you’re describing Curry’s off ball movement is comparable to Klay Thompson. Fantastic player, not mvp caliber though."
yes even klay thompson is a role player hes just the greatest role player ever. hes a star within his role
Game 6 Patty “Michael “Klay Thompson” Jordan” Mills in full flight!
"A lineup of Lillard, Curry, Thompson, Green, Looney  With Poole, Porter, Iguodala, and Bjelica as our only bench players ain’t going anywhere. Especially when Klay may not be back day 1. Why the deal needed to be done pre-draft. Maybe Hornets go get Markannen and we get an Oubre TPE to hold onto Wiggins. That’s much more stomachable but we’d need some big hits in the buyout market to win a title."
"A Deserved victory of the United States against a great team of France.  The two best teams of the tournament were there. The gap between the USA and the best teams in the world is getting smaller and smaller.  The United States will have to send their best team in the future to avoid future big disappointments.  The French have already given the Americans a date in 2024.  The most incredible thing about Team USA is the incredible talent pool.  The Olympic champion team would probably have been beaten by a team composed of: LeBron, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Harden, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Trae Young, Julius Randle."
If you laughed at the Klay Thompson choccy milk with his dog you'll enjoy this one.
"Correct, he did not become the clone of Klay Thompson, we are in agreement on that."
And? That doesn’t make him Klay Thompson.
Highly doubt he will ever be the level of shooter Klay Thompson is.
middle class klay thompson
I like Jordan Poole's chances. He is going to be the breakout star especially with Klay Thompson playing a limited role to start the year.  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT: spelling
"Since we just had the draft keep in mind Jimmer went before Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Vucevic and Jimmy Butler."
"would honestly be the most klay thompson thing ever. Struggles to get in rhythm all season, then magically it all clicks and he has the single greatest post-season of all time."

Klay Thompson: “Klay Thompson”
"Man technically the Warriors and Nets got better too, because Klay Thompson will be back, and the Nets got one year of chemistry under their belts and they should be better this year than they were last year."
"Klay Thompson injures opposing teams confidence in practice by scoring 69 points in 1 quarter. He shot 21/21 from 3 on 8 dribbles.   He had a noticeable limp that we asked him about after the game. He said: “slipped on my boat the other day, it’s the only thing I know that’s wetter than me… then again I did meet your mother the other day.”  In other, supposedly unrelated news, Otto porter Jr has retired from basketball. He shot 0/7 during practice and tore his acl guarding klay during his tsunami of 3s."
"ok? i mean Draymond isn't going to win a ring without Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, and I doubt they would win without Draymond either, so I don't really know what that statementt is supposed to mean"
we're adding klay thompson.
"im kind of surprised people think Klay Thompson can turn a non-playoff team into a title contender. also, the only reason the warriors even got into the playoff hunt was because wiseman got hurt."
Everyone saying no but if Steph didn’t get injured for like 10 games and they won 6/10 of those games they would have been 6th seed.   With an upgraded bench and Klay Thompson being 60-70% his old self i wouldn’t be surprised if they could grab the 3-4 seed especially given how open the West is
If Klay Thompson is Klay Thompson maybe but I find that hard to believe
BREAKING NEWS: Klay Thompson cleared to play for the 21/22 season.  _Later that day_  BREAKING NEWS: Steph Curry's right ACL signs a 2 year contract with the Shanghai Sharks for a reported $4 million.
if any team could make it work its the team with steph curry and klay thompson
Damian Lillard. Klay Thompson.
I like this list a lot. Hard to disagree with most of it for me except for some reason you don’t have KD which I’m sure you just brain farted and forgot him. I would put KD one and just move everyone down one on the list probs  Edit: I would also remove klay Thompson from the list. Given that he’s had two major injuries in the previous two years I don’t know how anyone can put klay too 20 when you’re not sure what kind of form he’ll be in when he eventually plays again. I’d probably put Zion in there in place of him.
I didn’t know there was such a huge overlap between hoop heads and I Think You Should Leave fans. I’m getting a custom Dan Flashes inspired Klay Thompson jersey. Who’s with me?
"&gt;There’s only one ball for the big 3 to share.  And guess what we were going to do?? Put it in the hoop.-Klay Thompson   And you got dragged down tot he wire by a hobbled team. Literally, a hobbled Nets gave the bucks their biggest challenge this playoffs, more than Miami, ATL, and Phoenix   That’s nothing more but reaffirmation that you were never beating even a half way healthy Nets team. This isn’t even to disrespect the Bucks, you play who’s in front of you, but that series just reaffirmed to me that the Bucks weren’t this scary dominant team that people kept claiming in the regular season. Both them and Phoenix are unlucky to be back in the finals"
"You're right, dunno why you're getting downvoted.   https://fansided.com/2021/06/11/warriors-klay-thompson-injury-history/"
Klay Thompson gets........again.Fck I don't even want to say it.
Something something Klay Thompson injured again something something
"""Klay Thompson fell off his boat while holding a toaster"""
He’s somehow surpassed Klay Thompson levels of sore loser
"So prove it.  What is your definition of best shooter? Steph Curry is still easily the best shooter in the league by both the eye test and stats and not close.  Durant is also in a different universe. Shot eFG% of fucking 60.8%, 53.7% on 2s, 45% on 3s, and 88% from FT.  So those are 2 unarguables.   For last year specifically Zach Levine had a much better shooting year (killed Dames numbers on similar volume), but hasn’t had the same year to year consistency.  Kylie Irving also was head and shoulders above Dame, literally in the 50/40/90 club last year.  Now we get into what you define as a good shooter. Harden had a worse year statistically last year, but I don’t think many people would argue he’s a worse shooter.  Seth Curry has smaller volume but shoots WAY better than Dame, esp from 3. Joe Harris also had much lower volume but blew away the eagle in combined 2 pt and 3pt shooting. 47.5% on 6.4 3pt attempts per game.  And ofc Klay Thompson was hurt, but is anyone really taking Dame over Klay for shooting?  So last year Dame was at least 5th, if not 7th or 8th depending on how you judge shooting. Going into next year assuming Klay and Harden are healthy, I’m easily putting Steph, Durant, Harden, Kylie, and Thompson as better shooters.  So yeah, I won’t wait for you to respond with facts, cause I know they aren’t coming."
"The person Rich Paul is probably thinking GSW would want to offload for Ben is Klay Thompson, but I imagine that Kerr is outspokenly against that idea."
"Nearly 3 years? It's been 2 years and 2 months since his last game. Even at the beginning of next season it'll be 2 years and a half. Also, if this was a player that predominately relied on his athleticism like Westbrook or Zion or someone like those players, I would be concerned. This is Klay Thompson, that dude with the nicest release in the history of basketball. His shooting is something that won't ever go away.   At worst maybe he's a bit slower, but that doesn't mean plays can't be adjusted to getting him open especially when they have the greatest shooter of all time the opposing team has to worry about. His shooting ability will always keep him among one of the most deadly teammates in the league which is something that will relieve a lot of pressure off of Curry. There wasn't a single game where Curry + Dray did some plays that left their wing players completely open by them doing nothing more than just standing in the corner, like Wiggins or Bazemore. Klay simply standing in a corner single handedly wins GSW's more games last year lmao."
"Really, really hoping Klay Thompson can pull off the same."
"In a weird way, Klay Thompson. He's been out of the league for almost 2 years now. He signed a contract extension I believe right before that. If he wants another 150M+ contract he'll have to show he can still do it."
Klay? R we thinking of the same klay Thompson 💀💀💀 idc if he is 80% that man is one of the best players in the league omg
"Oubre said that Kerr commenting that he would be coming off the bench if he re-signed with the Warriors (because, you know, there's this future HoFer called Klay Thompson...) ""lit a fire under him"", and that he felt he had been ""boxed in"" while with the Warriors.  Apparently he thinks the other FOs in the league are fucking stupid and didn't watch tape of him play for the Warriors, and the absurd amount of leash and playtime he got."
"Shoutout to Klay Thompson as well.  In the 2019 Finals vs the Raptors, with Durant out for basically the entire series, he was 26.6 PPG on 70.6% TS."
It might not be exactly half but he hasnt even started practice in anyway yet https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/steve-kerr-reveals-klay-thompson-has-taken-big-rehab-step%3famp Even when dude comes back he's gonna be rusty as hell and probably struggle since he tore an ACL and Achilles. You wont be a contender this year my man.
It's not even my thrilling Klay Thompson performance. It was fun as fuck but mostly an unimportant game
Two ACL tears on the same knee plus gungate.  Basically John Walled. Could be Klay Thompson at this rate too but I have faith in Klay's rehab process
We acquired a healthy klay Thompson this offseason
"It's a testament to how good BOTH of those dudes were in the OKC days. The 2014 team that lost in six in the WCF to the Spurs (who blasted the Heat by 20 ppg) had KD, Russ, and injured/hobbled Ibaka, a third-year Reggie Jackson, and then the rest of their playoff rotation was Kendrick Perkins, washed Caron Butler, rookie Steven Adams, Jeremy Lamb, and 39-year-old Derek Fisher. They won 59-games in the West that included Memphis, upstart Golden State, the peak lob city Clippers, and the champion Spurs.   KD and Russ were the only players in the Spurs series to average more than 12 ppg. Fisher was their fifth leading scorer with 5.7 ppg. Perry Jones, Lamb, Butler and Jackson combined to shoot 12/28 for three in the series. Fisher did shoot 8/17 from three, but was horrendous at everything else, including 3/13 from two in the series.  The 2016 Thunder beat the 67-win Spurs in six and then were up 3-1 on the 73-win Warriors before an epic collapse and a Klay Thompson miracle game 6. They lost the series because Klay and Steph combined to shoot 42% from three on over 21 combined attempts her game, and Harrison fuckin' Barnes somehow put in 10/19 from three over the series before turning into dogshit in the finals. While Russ didn't shoot well in the series, he did get to the line roughly nine time per game and shot 82% from there, and put up a statline of 27 / 11 / 7 and 3.7 steals per game. His defense was a key part of flummoxing the Warriors machine. The Thunder shot 32% in the series from three, and KD shot 29%.   They had a better overall roster in 2016 with Adams, Roberson, Waiters and Kanter, but still lacked a consistent supporting cast, had no outside shooting, and didn't have other creators on their roster. They still probably should have won the title.  In 2013, they had the best record in the West and Russ' knee was destroyed in the first playoff game. In 2015, KD hurt his foot and was out most of the season.  So, basically, even after Harden was gone they were in competitive WCF series against excellent teams every season Russ and KD were healthy. I am pretty confident they win a title or two over the next few seasons if KD stayed."
"&gt; 2019:  &gt; Best player: Klay Thompson, 26/5/2 on 71% TS  lmao"
How is RJ Barret in the same bracket as Klay fucking Thompson lol  Drummond and Adebayo/Ayton/Cousins as well

Is really fair to put Klay Thompson who hasn't played in two years over someone like lavine or Beal?  Also I still have lebron in my top 3 but how is kd still not over lebron I'd argue either kd or giannis are the best player in the league rn and my bias leans more to kd  Also Zion is top 30
People forget how good Klay Thompson actually is.  They are not that far away at all if he comes back to form.  We'll see.
"Not while he was with the Warriors, sure. That doesn't take away from the fact he punched Klay in the back of the head... THE Klay Thompson... The same guy who sings on instagram &amp; plays with his dog all day. Klay does not have any enemies, Klay doesn't deserve to be punched. Oubre isn't smart IMO."
"1996 is the only year that you can even argue MJ had a superteam and even then I am def taking Chris Bosh, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, and Russ over Bulls Rodman"
"I don't mind Lonzo and Caruso, but DeRozan clearly seems like a panic pick up in order to discourage LaVine from leaving...  DeRozan is basically the same archetype of a player as LaVine... Rhythm shooting combo guard that needs the ball in his hands but can't run the offense... And then you have to factor Lonzo in there somewhere too. I know LaVine can shoot from outside, but im not sure he's willing to veer more into a  Klay Thompson role to accommodate Lonzo and DeRozan needing time on the ball to maximize their effectives.   The Bulls might make the Playoffs still, on talent alone, since the Eastern conference is kind of trash after like the first 5,6 teams, but they're definitely not gonna make a deep run, imo"
"Larry ""Skywalker"" Nance Sr. and Jr. are both pretty nice  Mychal Thompson and Klay Thompson vs. the Curries in a shootout?  Rick Barry and all 3 Barry boys (Bones was probably the best)   Henry and Mike Bibby, though I think they still hate each other  Mike Dunleavy Sr. and Jr. would somehow finesse you out of every penny  Doc Rivers and Austin Rivers would probably call bullshit fouls  Fun fact: Melvin Booker and Devin Booker BOTH played against Kevin Garnett and Kobe. Imagine your pops giving you tips on guarding Kobe."
"James Harden, Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, Spencer Dinwiddie, Paul George, Kyle Korver, Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday, another dozen current NBA guys to choose from... yeah they'd be alright. 10m people though, not 4m like that dude said."
I dont know I’m not Klay Thompson. I was just stating a fact
You don't think Klay Thompson might have a somewhat biased opinion of how far Klay Thompson can take the Warriors next year?
"Who would you take over them though? The Suns and Jazz should be pretty good, but I don't think they'd be favored over the Lakers in a 7-game series.  The Warriors missed the playoffs last year and I don't think adding a Klay Thompson who hasn't played in two years will make them the #1 team in the West."
"-	KD, Slim Reaper -	LeBron, The Phenom -	Giannis, The Gyro Step or Super Gyro -	Bobby Portis, The Eater of Worlds -	Harden, The Soho Hobo -	Kyrie, Captain Bizarro -	Alex Caruso, The Ranger -	Steph Curry, The Spicy One -	Klay Thompson, Mr. Chocolate Milk -	Lowry and Jimmy, The Butt and The Butler  Some are purposely goofy, just trying to have some fun"
"Drazen Petrovic deserves a mention. Go ahead, I'll wait while you look up his stats. I would not include any other C in this but Kareem should be in there. I know centers get everything from within 5 feet of the basket but have you ever tried to sky hook? Dr. J might belong here, Adrian Dantley too. Karl Malone definitely belongs here. Jayson Tatum and Klay Thompson are both working their way into this conversation."
1. Stephen Curry   2. Ray Allen   3. Klay Thompson   4. Reggie Miller   5. Steve Nash   6. Kevin Durant   7. Larry Bird   8. Kyle Korver   9. J.J. Redick    10. Dirk Nowitzki
"I didn’t mean to trash the knicks it’s a fine deal for them cause they have money to spend and need to keep winning to improve their reputation around the league. But for a team like Boston who already has 2 stars in the making they need cap space. And paying fournier 18m a year for 3 years is just not it and kills flexibility. My opinion on fournier is just he’s a very good shooter but he can’t maximize his shooting like guys such as Duncan Robinson, JJ redick in the past, klay Thompson etc. Fournier just is slow so he’s not as much a threat off ball."
So Klay Thompson?
Klay Thompson in a all time staring lineup? Idk about all that
I think that team is better with Lebron as the PG and Klay Thompson to replace Curry. That lineup would be just brutal defensively. Opponents couldn't score anywhere.
"I find it funny how LeBron playing off ball is a waste of his ball handling talent, but James Harden, who was probably the best handler for the last 5 or so years, should play more off ball. And you can't really claim ""oh, well there's an in between...."" because no one was asking LeBron to play like Klay Thompson in the first place."
"Again it depends on the guy. See, Klay Thompson and DeMarcus Cousins who both missed a whole season in 2019, and Jabari Parker (injured in Feb 2017 and didn’t return till Feb 2018) and Brandon Knight who got injured in July 2017 and missed the whole next season."
It's the same guy who gilds anything about Klay Thompson.
Warriors now have 5 sons of former NBA players:  Steph Curry // Dell Curry  Klay Thompson // Mychal Thompson  Nico Mannion // Pace Mannion  Andre Wiggins // Ender Wiggin  Otto Porter // Walt Chamberloin
"Yes, for two reasons. First of all, Klay Thompson is still injured and no one has any idea what he's going to look like when he comes back. Second of all, Joe Lacob just gave a long rambling interview about how the team is looking to build for the future and probably isn't going to trade any of its young guys. If I'm a veteran looking to get a ring, I'm not going to go to the team that isn't going all in on trying to win a ring now, especially with one of their major players a question mark until later this year."
[Praise Jerry West](https://www.si.com/nba/2015/06/11/jerry-west-klay-thompson-kevin-love-deal)
"It's not the same. Currys FO killed it with draft choices, and he was locked in his deal as the other talents were emerging. Dirk was surrounded by wily veterans and they had no second star. The closest thing would've been Jason Terry or Tyson Chandler... not exactly a Klay Thompson."
"How the does hard capping the team with Lonzo help the Bulls win games?  Is Zach all of a sudden Klay Thompson?  Is Vucci Mane now Joel Embid?  Do those guys need help getting set up?  Why are the Bulls so hard up for a non-shooting PG?  How does this move the needle on the Bulls?  Further, the Bulls owners HATE divas.  Literally the second Lonzo’s dad opens his mouth, Lonzo is gone in a trade no matter how bad or how long it fucks the Bulls over for."
Tim has a higher ceiling but a lower floor. One game he shoots like Klay Thompson and then the next game he could shoot like the 2018 WCF Rockets
The Klay Thompson special.
"It's borderline ridiculous to think you're getting back all-star caliber Klay Thompson. He had back to back injuries that end careers of many players and hasn't seen an NBA court in over 2 years. I think a very positive outlook is that he gets integrated back in and mostly just isn't absolutely ass. His movement is going to be much worse, and all of Klay's specialties rely heavily on quick movement. Hopefully he gets back to where he was, but it won't be soon, probably not even this year."
The top 75 thing was absurd.  Whose career would you rather have - AD or Klay Thompson?  I mean...
Or Klay Thompson for that matter.
"I guess that gets to the heart of the matter. Isn’t that what being an All-Time Great is about? The accolades and the mark you made/are making in the game?  Of the new entries, and in the order of, the following compelled me to raise a brow:  Anthony Davis Damian Lilard  Ray Allen Russ Westbrook  In advance, we know why Westbrook is there. So love him or hate him, it is what it is.  Dwight Howard Klay Thompson   These two should have been on that list. Hell, AD just won a title with a healthy and rested James—before that, what was he? I’d just assume give McGrady his spot, if the criteria was that low."
They forgot about Klay Thompson.
"Between regular season and postseason, that’s like 30 missed games or about a third. I wouldn’t call that exactly reliable. It’s going to be the same thing this year. I guess you’re going to tell me how great John Wall and Klay Thompson are and where they should be ranked? At a certain point, you just need to allow those recovering from injury to just rehab and get back on the court. There’s no point in discussing how wonderful those guys are as they haven’t played very much recently. Yea, when they play they are good. You can’t know how good Kawhi will be after serious injury. Nobody knows how anyone will recover from such things."
"Again, I give the simplest counter to this arguement. Dwight Howard had a better career than AD. They were both on the Lakers team to win their only title. Let's take that year away from both of them and look at the bulk of their career. Theres no way you can argue that AD's career with the Pelicans is better than Dwight's career with the Magic. If you are going to use the championship arguement that he was the second to Lebron in the Lakers title, then Klay Thompson deserves it. Won a title as the second scorer to Curry and was a 3rd option in a dynasty. Theres a bunch of 4th options and below that won a title in 1973 with the Knicks that are in the top 75 list that shouldn't be on it."
"- Warriors played 12 players tonight - Klay Thompson and James Wiseman are at home - Every single night will be a challenge when they return  Warriors will collapse, miss playoffs presumably"
Word Klay Thompson didn’t even make the list 🤯
"*Klay Thompson, 77th best player of all time*"
Yeah it’s ridiculous how much Karma I get from dumb Klay Thompson related posts
"Dude Kuminga is lookin really good. Yalls team is so fun I love it. Poole was a nice surprise, I love Draymond taking a more Rodman role, Steph is better than ever, GPII is must watch basketball, Porter is lookin good, Wiggins decides to play basketball every once in awhile, and you have KLAY FUCKING THOMPSON in your back pocket?! I'm a big fan."
Heck even Klay Thompson deserved it a lot more
One of the stupidest things on social media is people pretending Klay Thompson is somehow cool or hilarious when he has the personality of an IRS tax auditor and is lame as hell.
"&gt;I can buy most of that, but personally don't think having Russ and the pup version of Harden compares to having Prime Shaq, arguably a top 5 all-time player.  Nah, having Westbrook and Harden doesn't compare to having a prime Shaq. You know what it does compare to tho? I'd probably say that it's even better than having a prime Shaq. Having the only unanimous MVP in NBA history Steph Curry who had just had the best offensive season of all-time better than peak Shaq , DPOY Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Iggy. Why are we pretending like Kobe having a Prime Shaq is at all comparable to KD joining the best team in NBA history?   Kobe with just Pau Gasol accomplished as much as the KD warriors did. Having Westbrook and Harden, hell just having Westbrook by himself is probably better than having a Pau Gasol. Let's not pretend like KD has had it worse than Kobe when it comes to teams."
"well you see the Nets have $33M in salary sitting on the bench, whereas Klay Thompson only gets paid $40M"
When Demon Overlord Steph Wardell Curry and his Great General Draymond Backpack Green are already dad dicking the Hero's army and here's another Great General Klay Toaster Thompson about to join the one sided beatdown.
This team is going to be getting Klay Thompson back in a few months. Safe to say that the Warriors are back.
"KD apologists better understand why he won those rings so easy in Golden State. Curry alone creates problems for everyone now throw in a healthy Klay Thompson, you get a dynasty"
Not to mention he gave up playing with Steph for Kyrie and now Kyrie isn’t playing at all and Steph is dropping 37 on him while Klay Thompson heals on his boat.
"Their postgame thread is pretty salty too. ""Injury-riddled Nets"", as if we weren't missing Klay Thompson (multi-year All-Star, top 5 shooter all-time, all-NBA defender) and James Wiseman (#2 overall pick, and literally 50% of our center presence). That easily outweights Joe Harris, Paul Millsap, and Nic Claxton. Unless you're counting Kyrie, but he's not out due to injury. He's out due to being a woke idiot, which their front office knew full well when they signed him."
"Most Career Games With 9+ 3-Pointers Made,  NBA History  Stephen Curry - 37  James Harden -  9  Damian Lillard - 9  Klay Thompson - 7  JR Smith - 5  Kobe Bryant - 4  So, yes, I'll save you the math: he has more than the next five guys combined (34)."
Klay Thompson is the perfect complimentary player for literally any superstar.     Excellent shooter who plays good defense.
Have you met Klay Thompson?
"With Klay. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson is the best backcourt of all time, and is the best backcourt in the league when healthy."
Imagine this warriors team with Klay Thompson
"AD, Lillard &amp; to a lesser degree Paul Pierce should not have been on that list over Klay Thompson, Dwight Howard were major snubs.  Parker, Ginobili, Pau and maybe even Derrick Rose deserved a spot. Rose obviously had major injury issued but he and Jokic are the only MVPs not on the list. Injuries didn't keep Walton off; same should have been said about Rose.  As for OPs question: AD is and will always be a second option. Everyone knows who he is at this point and do not expect more out of him...because they're not going to get it."
You can compare accolades tho. 3x all NBA and 7x all-star appearances is a Klay Thompson tier player.
I was surprised Klay Thompson wasn't on the top 75 list more so than Dwight Howard.
"He won 1 playoff series without Lebron, beating the Blazers. Klay Thompson beat the Blazers in 2016 largely without Steph while averaging 30. That certainly isn't enough to put Klay in the top 75. And I admit freely that AD is a better player than Klay, no doubt. He's not had teams built around him or a co-star that helps him prior to Lebron, and Lebron will always overshadow him. If you only found success in the playoffs by teaming up with the GOAT people will question you. Especially if the minute that player goes down you can't find a way to win. AD is in his prime and has plenty of time to continue to show his greatness so comparing him to former players entire careers is premature. But he will have to find a way to win as the lead guy once Lebron is no longer the best player on the Lakers."
"It's crazy that this sub will criticize Anthony Davis for being a top 75 player that can't carry a team while also advocating for guys like Dennis Rodman, Ben Wallace and Klay Thompson to be on the list. I will bet any amount of money that if those players had to carry their own team they would be much worse than Anthony Davis.  No one would object to Kevin McHale being on the list but if Anthony Davis played his entire career with LeBron we would view him as being as good if not better than Kevin McHale.   If the year was 2005 this sub would be saying the same thing about Kevin Garnett that they are about Anthony Davis.  I would much rather have a player who can be the second best player on a championship team vs. a player who can carry a bad team to a first round exit."
It was always sus when Westbrook was added but not Klay Thompson or LaMelo
"""Anthony Davis led his team to a title"" lmao    That's the equivalent of saying ""Klay Thompson led the Warriors to a title"" or ""Kyrie Irving led the Cavs to a title""    No, he played sidekick to the greatest player in NBA history. He didn't lead shit. We're seeing right now what happens when AD has to lead a team."
No one is asking AD to win a championship all by himself.  You're conflating arguments.  Embiid hasn't won a chip yet either but he can at least carry his team to a good seed and make some deep playoff runs.  Davis can do neither of those things.  He's an elite role player.  He's like the Klay Thompson of centers.
"And then imagine also having a non-injured, 100% Klay Thompson"
What? Klay Thompson is actually injured.
Klay Thompson is also rich. Should the Warriors not pay him?
Klay thompson but with elite playmaking
"The 2017 Warriors were getting their asses handed to them by an injured Spurs team missing its starting PG. Kawhi Leonard, who's a poor man's MJ, was locking up KD. Go look it up. KD couldn't score for his life until Kawhi got taken out by Zaza.   You want to say it was just one game? Ok. You're seriously telling mean all time team like the Bulls would have problems replicating that defense intensity in a series? Seriously think about this. That Spurs team which was missing TP and had an old Pau starting games, was able to contain the Warriors. Nobody on that team is known as great defenders other than Danny Green and Kawhi. Yet they were still able to contain the Warriors and were up over 20 points led by Kawhi who was scoring on KD, Dray, Iggy, Klay, with no problem mostly in the mid range. MJ is 10 times the scorer Kawhi is. People saying who would stop KD as if Scottie and MJ couldn't hold KD. The real question is who's stopping MJ? Recency bias is a hell of a drug because MJ is on another level of scoring from KD. Even KD himself said MJ is a fucking god of basketball and study his moves to this day.   And what the hell is with people saying omg this team is going to be awestruck. HUH? Are we acting like this is some college team getting a chance to play the pros? This is the most legendary team of all time. It's Michael fucking Jordan. The bulls practice with the GOAT every single day. I'm sure they'll be ok watching Klay thompson average 19 ppg."
"2011 draft is pretty good in this regard.  13 of the first 19 picks have played at least 10 seasons, with 1 of the 6 who hasn't being Klay Thompson who is in his 11th season of being paid.  Jan Vasely (6) and Chris Singleton (18) are the only Top 19 picks to play less than 5 seasons at 3 each. Derrick Williams (2), Jimmer Fredette (10), and Brandon Knight (8) are the guys to play more than 5, but less than 10 seasons. Brandon Knight made $80 million, Derrick Williams $31 million, and Jimmer Freddette $9 million, so monetarily Jimmer was the only big failure out of this group.  So 2011 enters at 12/14 lottery picks with solid careers, and 16/19 of the first 19 picks having solid careers."
Does Grant Williams think he's Klay Thompson?
"There are about 42 million people in the Yoruba tribe, so this is kinda like saying ""Westbrook, Lillard, Kawhi, Paul George, Brooke and Robin Lopez, James Harden, Reggie Miller, Klay Thompson, and the Ball Brothers are all from California."""
Curry won the MVP twice playing next to Klay Thompson who averaged 20+ pts on elite 3 point shooting and elite defense.
"Yeah, probably even more if you replaced Kyrie Irving with Klay Thompson and Blake Griffin with Draymond Green"
Klay Thompson. I think that kid just might make a splash in this league.
"When Rozier is playing his starting role next to LaMelo, he is a near-perfect fit for our starting 5 and I think he was statistically the most clutch player in the league last year.  It goes to shit when he's asked to create for the second unit and make decisions with the ball. It's like if you asked Klay Thompson to facilitate, it's just not part of his skillset.   Terry has had a rocky start to the season, he sprained one ankle in the preseason and the other in his first game back, so he's been understandably rough, but he's looked like himself the last 3 or 4 games and been key to our last couple big wins. I'll take him over Lonzo on this team, but I'd take Devonte' Graham at less than half price leaving enough room for a better center than Plumlee over either Terry or Lonzo"
I have come from the Future and I can say the East is better overall conference period. The only thing they don't have is the fucking Warriors (at the time of these writting) who are 11-2 without James Wisemen and Klay Thompson. The Hawks (as of this writing) are 5-9 which is good enough for 13th in the East of they were in the West they would be 10th and since the play in tournament got made they have a chance to be in the playoffs. Now before anybody flipout this is still early in the season so it could change
Sustained production matters. What good is a player can only get hot every now and then? Is Klay Thompson the best player in the NBA because scored 37 points in a quarter? No.  The honour of being the best player belongs to player who increases the probability of winning games the most.
“Only boring people get bored”- Klay Thompson
League average TS% is 55 Lmao  With your horrible logic you just said Klay Thompson is worse than mediocre since he has a career 57 TS%
Oh are you one of those Klay Thompson is gonna plug and play and Wiseman is gonna take the jump from horrendous to good tbh is year?
"thats what klay thompson is for lol, how spoiled are the warriors that they need even more balll handlers and scorers"
GuyCarbonneau spams posts that aren’t remotely related to anything relevant. Like Klay Thompson eating shrimp on his boat. Okay cool but there’s 8 fucking games on and I wanna see highlights. I legitimately get annoyed with that dude.
Trade Kat and Klay Thompson to the Celtics
"Guys like Keldon ""literally Klay Thompson"" Johnson should help"
Melo turning into tatted Klay Thompson has been my favorite development this season  Stay Me7o
"Dwights best year he averaged 22 points, they won 59 games and they lost in the first round to Atlanta lmao. Klays best year he averaged 22points and they won 73 games. There is no universe where you can win a championship with Dwight as a starter. Ya he can get some rebounds but he has zero offense. Good bench player. Better than Klay Thompson lmaooooo."
"""Curry beat KD"". No, the Warriors beat the Thunder when they had a 73 win roster, and they would've lost if Klay Thompson doesn't go supernova."
"Klay Thompson who was a good two way player,  one of the best sharpshooters in the league. And rarely missed games due to injury. He's also Loyal to his team."
calling it “poor shot selection” doesn’t do it justice. dude pretty much shot us out of multiple close games at the end of the season because he thought he was Klay Thompson
"Injuries, other top players eventually adjusting to the new ball / officiating over the course of the 82 game season, integrating James Wiseman and Klay Thompson into their lineup while ensuring that their role-player wings get consistent minutes, other teams game-planning exploiting their weaknesses around their center rotation."
"Such is the life of a pure shooter. That's what separates him, Redick, Korver, etc. from Klay Thompson. He really was an amazing slasher and got pretty good at attacking and finishing at the rim."
"It's odd that he's shooting really poorly on wide open 3s. If he can get that back to his normal averages he will be around 43-45%. Eventually Klay Thompson will return, and while the defense might suffer some, Steph should have more space to work with. Klay was really good that year and Draymond shot a career high from 3 that year which really opened up things for Steph."
"A lot of people have claimed that Westbrook is a better defender than Steph.  There's still people who think Steph is/was a bad defender, and point to him getting hunted on switches when the rest of the lineup was KD, Draymond Green, Iguodala (or Durant) and Klay Thompson, like just about anyone else in the league wouldn't be the defensive weak link in THAT lineup.  It was the cornerstone of the argument that Westbrook was as good as/better than Curry, based on Curry being unquestionably better at every aspect of offensive play."
Idk ask Klay Thompson.
And Klay Thompson won’t! This list is a joke
"Man you're a real piece of work lol. ""Free history lesson"" my ass lol. You're an absolute goomba. If you actually had an elementary grasp of reading, you'd see that the person above you also mentioned that Klay Thompson has been out for the entirety of the time Steph was out (which is the entire basis of your argument for why the Warriors suck without steph). A team that has over 40% of cap space tied to injured players (not a problem that the Bulls had because Jordan was off the roster and they were free to sue the cap however they wanted) is gonna have a hard time.  For a more complete example, take Paul George off the clippers. Are they contending now? Probably not. That's basically what the Warriors were with Curry and Klay out.  All the examples you're providing are of teams built completely differently. They're all ""balanced"" teams with a strong division between stars and role-players. The Warriors were built around Steph. So when Steph goes down, you can't just ""adapt"" the roster. These guys are not iso-scorers, and the entire motion offense goes away.   At this point, I'm wasting my time. You're obviously down the rabbit hole on your opinion, so any further conversation is pointless."
The fact that this is all before Klay Thompson comes back is crazy. James Wiseman coming back should be a good boost for them also. That team is scary.
Imagine when Klay “there goes that man” Thompson comes back.
"Lol. He didn’t struggle offensively in the playoffs his whole career.   Tell me that you don’t know what you’re talking about without telling me you don’t know what you’re talking about.  Jordan was the leader.   Steph curry is the leader of the warriors, but they weren’t winning a title without klay Thompson or draymond.  Jordan never wins without Pippen."
Imagine when klay Thompson and wisemen comes back!
"I think most of harden being a beast was the play style. All he did was draw fouls and pad broadcast time at the free throw line. Now look at him. Can’t draw fouls and therefore can’t be the ridiculous 40 a night guy. If anyone got snubbed from the top 75, it’s Klay Thompson.  A shame that the nba just added 25 players to their old top 50.  Half the players on the old list were from the 40s to 60s that just don’t stack up to the 80s to modern day players that appeared."
"Clippers, Grizzly, Lakers, maybe the Suns have the players matchup to stop Warriors offense in the West playoffs. Klay Thompson coming back is crucial to provide consistent space to make the offense run smoother."
"To be brutally honest, he played as a 4th option on a sub-par offensive team with an all-star in Vucevic, who sure as hell wasn't voted an all-star because of his defence.   And the fact Ross can be game-planned out of games easier than other guys doesn't exactly help his case.   The occasional big game doesn't make someone a 1-man offence.   He doesn't have the ball-handling, playmaking or consistency to be considered a 1-man offence. Hell, I wouldn't even say Klay Thompson is a 1-man offence and he was putting up numbers Ross could never dream of.  When I can get a different decent role player for a couple of 2nds, why would I pay a full 1st on your decent role player?"
Did Klay thompson not put james harden away in 5 games without Steph on the court? Harden is a product of the dantoni system. Klay is a better 5v5 player hence him being a better SG
? on paper? ive seen klay put james harden away in 5 games in a playoff series BY HIMSELF. Klay is a better shooter than James and can score in bunches just as well as james without the foul baiting. Klay thompson is a better defender. Klay has 3 rings and fits into any 5 man lineup. Klay is the better SG
JAMES HARDEN WAS PUT AWAY IN 5 GAMES IN 2016 TO A STEPHLESS WARRIORS AND KLAY THOMPSON AS THE NUMBER 1 OPTION. THE NBA IS A 5V5 SPORT. KLAY IS A BETTER SG IN A 5 MAN LINEUP THAN HARDEN AS PROVEN BY HIS 3 RINGS. GIVE ME THE BETTER SHOOTER AND DEFENDER AS MY SG EVERY TIME
"ya i agree with that. i dont expect it to be in the same form  it might end up being something like a duncan robinson / klay thompson on steroids where they shatter 3pt shooting off of the catch but are one dimensional compared to steph. so he’d remain the best shooter overall but in terms of one specific area of shooting, they might be better.   that might be more likely than anything else honestly. guys like drob and klay are insane already, but it’s not hard to see them surpassed"
"And then Andre, standing behind Klay says, “And this is Klay Thompson”"
"Awaiting the return of his Splash Brother, Klay Alexander Thompson following a lengthy sabbatical, Prince of no dribbles, Master of Boats, the Chillest, fellow holder of 3 rings, affectionately known as the 77th Knight of the realm, instant buckets Specialist, and Best Friend of Rocco and everyone not named Rodney McGruder."
Kyrie-LeBron-Love-Jr-Thompson vs Steph-Klay-Barnes-iggy-Dray in terms of talent the Cavs were just as skilled.
As much as I dislike Kyrie a full Nets vs this Warriors team with a good Klay Thompson would be amazing
"True story the other day I decided to watch an old game because I'd been talking to my brother-in-law about a 2018 game.  Klay Thompson pulled up for a jumper, didn't even hit it and I had tears.  I just really miss watching him play basketball.  I'm going to be *sobbing* when Klay plays again."
"&gt;It's apples and oranges. Those Kobe teams won at a very small time. The Durant warriors would probably destroy them.   I think you're missing my point. Kobe accomplished the same amount as KD with a far less talented team.   &gt; Also you're leaving out Andre Bynum who was pretty damn good in those days.  What? Andrew Bynum was a role player on those teams and he missed the entire 2008 postseason. He was a good rim protector but he's not Draymond, Klay level good.   &gt;Durant is every bit as good as Kobe ever was. There is a lot of revisionist history about Kobe, but look at the numbers.  Kobe destroys KD in defense and it's not even close. It's much easier to score now than it was during Kobe's era. I also think Kobe's perceived 'inefficiency' is really overblown. Many people will cite 'oh Durant was a more efficient ISO scorer than Kobe ever was.' This is when you need to look at the tale of the tape as opposed to advanced metrics or statistics because they can't tell you the whole story.  All ISO efficient scorers this league have one important luxury that players back then really did not: the rate at which a big man is switched onto them.  It is very rare now for teams to run an ISO without a PNR to get a big or mismatch onto the player ISO-Scoring. How often do you see a team run a switch for Durant, Harden, Curry, or LeBron to get their primary defender off of them? Just take a look at the 2016 Game 5 or 6 highlights that LeBron had. They forced the switch repeatedly so that LeBron could ISO against a big. You could even watch James Harden's recent explosion on the Cavs where the big (Tristan Thompson) was switched onto him repeatedly.  This big vs. guard ISO wasn't as prominent back then for one simple reason: the bigs back then couldn't stretch the floor for 3 points.  When guarding against a big setting a PNR before the three point explosion, you could live with a player scoring a given 2 points if you trapped the ball-handler. Now, you can't simply because 3 points, despite just being one point greater will add up terribly in a game. Teams nowadays do not have the luxury of being able to trap the ball handler when the big setting the pick can shoot the 3 ball. Ironically, this is how Golden State went on an absolute tear last year. Everytime they had forced it out of Curry's hands in the PNR with Green, there was a three on four, which back then would have led to a 2 point score; instead they blew games open with repeated 3 point bombs.  In the previous eras, ISOs were run with the primary scorer being guarded by the primary defender, whether that be Bruce Bowen, Doug Christie, etc. So when you consider that Kobe's points were predicated on playing one on one against their best defender, as opposed to a slower big, then you hold his shooting percentages, whether advanced or just regular FG% in higher regard.   &gt;He didn't rack up multiple MVPs. He was never this dominant force that could just carry a team to greatness.  KD doesn't have multiple MVPs either. Kobe could carry a team much more than KD can. Gasol was good but he's no unanimous MVP, not to mention Klay, Draymond, and Iggy.   &gt;Kobe was never at any point the best player in the league. For three of his titles he wasnt the best player on his team.  I'd say he was the best from 2006-2010. You could argue that Kobe was just as good as Shaq in 01.   &gt; Those warriors were better with Durant than they would have been with Kobe. No question.  Nah. Fact is Durant had to join the most stacked team in NBA history to even win a ring. Kobe's 2008-2010 run is better than anything KD has done. He averaged 30/6/6 on 57% TS in the playoffs, played excellent defense, made 3 straight Finals, and won 2 FMVPs. And this includes 2010 when he was banged the hell up. KD needs to prove he can win without the most stacked team in NBA history before he passes Kobe."
"Nah, I was just assuming you were the Lakers idiot.  Correction: your FO caused serious injuries to Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant?  Because if one of those stayed healthy Raptors lose."
That's fair enough but Damion Lee being 6x more effective than Klay Thompson as a shooting guard is not.
"Some say that Klay ""Gendry"" Thompson is still rowing..."
"[538 Preseason Forecast](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-bucks-run-it-back-can-lebron-win-his-fifth-ring-how-our-model-sees-the-2021-22-nba-season/)  &gt;We next have to address the Warriors, who are projected to finish worse than they did last year and miss the play-in tournament entirely. And that’s not because the model isn’t accounting for Klay Thompson playing games. It’s actually the opposite.  5 RAPTOR penalizes players who suffer Achilles tears, as Thompson did prior to last season. Throw in the fact that he was already coming off a torn ACL prior to that, and the model now views him as a net-negative player. The model views the Warriors, like the Lakers, as being chock-full of negatives, with only Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Gary Payton II (The Mitten!) grading out as net positives, among the team’s projected rotation players."
"I feel like we’re arguing semantics.  I understand the mental distress most people with mental health issues are under, and I understand the difficulty posed by basic every day tasks with something like severe anxiety or depression. However, these mental issues are just that. They’re all in someone’s head. That doesn’t make them any easier to deal with, but it means they still have the physical capability to do whatever they could do prior, unlike something like a broken leg or torn Achilles which makes you completely physically incapable of doing many of those things. I’m not saying people should just suck it up, but it’s fundamentally  incomparable to a situation like Klay Thompson"
"It's not that tough when you consider the players you sign. Does anyone think Klay Thompson is happy staying home for 2+ seasons and getting paid to play zero basketball? No. He's a competitor. And that's the bet you take when you give hundreds of millions of dollars to these guys. That they want to compete at the highest level. This isn't the NFL. You can't cut these players. You take the risk when you sign any player to a long term deal that they want to win. I think this sub gets too caught up in their own jobs and how they would love to stay home and get paid. That's not how athletes work. Hell, I just played in a softball tournament last night for free. The teams assume guys want to play so one guy sitting for a season or two because he's a big baby doesn't set a precedent because 99% of the guys would absolutely hate to stay home and not play."
Klay Thompson: Am I a joke to you?   There's a splash bro reckoning coming
"You seem to be jumping back and forth between an NBA contract and working at Wal Mart. The players have earned a ""better"" contract. I don't know what that is but it's probably better than most regular jobs so that shouldn't be a factor. Klay Thompson hasn't played a game in more than 2 seasons. He's still being paid. How is that applicable to any other job you're trying to bring into this conversation? To be clear, I realize these are complicated issues. Any time you have a contract that expects someone to perform at a certain level is going to be. I'm in the music business and you deal with the same thing with artists. You can't make them write and perform a great song at a high level. You have to take that gamble. Which is what you do with athletes as well. If they can't perform, you have to absorb the risk. Unless it's the NFL where you can just cut the guy. But this is what the players fought for."
"I think the general sentiment here was that they would be a playoff team. The team is better than last year and they were technically the 8 seed. Also, the Klay Thompson is coming back. Even if he's half the player he was, that's a positive contribution. Personally, I thought they'd be 6-8 seed. A tough first round match up but they wouldn't make it out of the 2nd round.  But you're right. I don't think anyone seriously thought they'd be as good as they have been so far. It's still early but theyre showing that they have the potential to compete for the title."
Klay Thompson hasn't played a game in more than 2 seasons. Why is he still being paid? What you (and many others) fail to realize is that this isn't any other job. It's the NBA. These guys are worth millions and worth giving these benefits to. It's discussed before they sign the contract. What happens at Wal Mart is not applicable to this discussion.
Which is exactly what Klay Thompson has received for 2 plus seasons.
What are you talking about? This couldn't be further from that. They're not freelancers. Klay Thompson hasn't played in one game in more than two years. He's being paid in full. What freelancer is being paid for doing nothing for two years?
Draymond is arguably the best defensive player of his generation.  The guy is just nuts on that end of the floor.  It's kind of funny how casuals think Klay Thompson is more valuable than him.... when really it's not even close in the other direction

"The 2016 Thunder team that was one Klay Thompson historic shooting performance from eliminating the 73-win Warriors? Come on man, that’s a weak argument. That team was a powerhouse and bowed out to one of the best teams of all time.   The Harden trade is such revisionist history. Was he an important piece? Yes! And obviously they would have wanted nothing more than to have him back. But it was much more an ownership decision to not accommodate him financially than it was a Presti decision. Also recall the league was not in the same place as it is now re: perimeter players vs big men and Harden was coming off a historically bad NBA Finals against Miami."

"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
"I mean Mark Jackson managed to take Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala all the way to the conference semifinals. Then he got fired and the Warriors won the Finals the next year with basically zero roster changes. I can't imagine why nobody wants to hire him!"
That sums up why the Golden State Warriors quickly traded Monta Ellis and drafted Klay Thompson once the Warriors saw what Steph could do.

There certainly would be more pressure on him to do that.  Yes the Warriors drafted well but Curry and Thompson being available past pick like 5 is very very rare.  If you go back through the last 4 or 5 drafts nobody remotely close to that caliber is taken late and by late I mean after the first few picks.  Maybe Donovan Mitchell.  With all due respect to the Raptors if Durant doesn't tear his Achilles and Klay doesn't tear his ACL they don't win that season.   It's not big market I'm talking about, I'm saying it all comes down to a few stars and where they want to play.  If they don't pick you, you basically need the stars to align with two historically great players falling to you past the top few picks or major injuries at the right time.  The Spurs won the lottery and their guy wanted to stay, if we're being honest I'd say those Warriors teams or the Nets healthy now would beat all those Spurs teams.  Most teams have no chance at getting Durant or Kawhi or Kyrie or Steph or LeBron or Davis.  Much less another guy of that caliber which is what you really need or you're ""wasting his talent"" because all you can get is role players and overpaid Middleton/Hayward caliber pseudo stars."
Draft Picks are a lottery and getting more lottery tickets is a good thing.  Not all of the stars in the NBA were picked in the top 2.    Past 10 drafts  2010 Best Players  * John Wall (1)  * DeMarcus Cousins (5)  * Gordan Hayward (9)  * Paul George (10)   2011 Best Players  * Kawhi Leonard (15)   * Kyrie Irving (1)   * Kemba Walker (9)   * Klay Thompson (11)   * Jimmy Butler (30)  2012 Best players  * Anthony Davis (1)  * Bradley Beal (3)  * Damien Lillard (6)  * Draymond Green (35)  * Khris Middleton (39)  2013 Best players  * Victor Oladipo (2)  * Giannis Anteokoumpo (15)  * Rudy Gobert (27)  2014 Best Players  * Joel Embiid (3)  * Julius Rangle (7)  * Zach Lavine (13)  * Nikola Jocic (41)  2015 Best Players  * Karl Anthony Towns (1)  * D'Angelo Russell (2)  * Devin Booker (13)  2016 Best players  * Ben Simmons (1)  * Brandon Ingram (2)  * Jaylen Brown (3)  * Domantas Sabonis (11)  * Pascal Siakam (27)  2017 Best players  * Jayson Tatum (3)  * De'Aron Fox (5)  * Donovan Mitchell (13)  * Bam Adebayo (14)  * John Collins (19)  2018 Best players  * Deandre Ayton (1)  * Luca Doncic (3)  * Trae Young (5)  * Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (11)  2019 Best Players  * Zion Williamson (1)  * Ja Morant (2)  2020 Best Players  * La Melo Ball (3)
"jesus dude you are absolutely REACHING to put down cp3 lol  david west, tyson chandler, and peja are what are called role players. klay thompson is what is called a future hall of famer.   if cp3 gets to play with booker for a few more years, then we can put this idiotic argument to bed permanently but what are you even talking about comparing david west to fucking karl malone lmao"
He wasn’t quiet this gam as much as he was Klay Thompson last game
"For me its Bogdan Bogdanovic, Ben MacLemore, and Klay Thompson"
Someone told me that Joe Harris is on par with Steph Curry and Klay Thompson. Hmmmmmm.
Harris is a great shooter and almost automatic when he is open. But he isn't in the league of Curry and Thompson in tight spaces or off the dribble (I know Klay is more of a spot up guy too).
"Klay Thompson really had multiple final runs and a title as an all-star and 2nd option, only to be compared to a role player with no playoff resume."
Klay Thompson is way better than most of these guys. He's scored 60 in 3 quarters twice? He is a human toaster. He definitely can create his own shot but doesn't have to. He took like 11 dribbles to score 60 in 3 quarters and scored 37 points in a quarter.
People really compared him to Klay Thompson my lord
People really compared him to Klay Thompson my lord
People really compared him to Klay Thompson my lord
Let’s never compare him to klay Thompson again
Let’s never compare him to klay Thompson again
If sixers fans can move from Simmons   Nets fans should be 100% be doing the same right now.   This man is sorry and don’t y’all ever compare him to klay Thompson ever again.
Nick Young turning into prime Klay Thompson lol
Klay Thompson — 37-points in a quarter game against the Kings  Kawhi Leonard — Game 7 of the 2019 Eastern Conference Semifinals
Steph curry was born rich with everything laid out for him. So that argument is kinda weak….and there’s plenty of other sons of former nba basketball players that have pushed themselves. Klay Thompson as well…they all have an ego
"Klay Thompson would say otherwise. I'm not on the Warriors training staff but I'm sure if he had a very lengthy injury recovery and there was &lt;5% compensation, who knows? He might have had protection from his second injury.  I'm not making a scientific or medical claim. I'm not an orthopedic surgeon. I'm just saying KD is a decent case report for these kinds of injuries that take a long time to heal in the atmosphere of expectations by the media and fans.  If Joe at the office who is a salesman hurts himself, I'm sure Joe goes to work in a boot or a brace and takes as long as he wants to heal and he probably doesn't injure himself again. His company isn't counting on his legs. Then again, Joe isn't playing elite sports that puts strain on him."
"Of fucking course it is. You have Klay motherfucking Thompson as your 6th man, and seeing the starting lineup, its obvious why."
"The Warriors have a history of small ball and ball-movement-based offenses, going back to the small ball of the we believe team and the run and gun style of Run TMC. The modern dynasty run and the 07 We Believe run were also underrated in terms of scrappy defense. I think you can construct just such a lineup using only historic Warriors players:   PG: Stephen Curry SG: Klay Thompson SF: Chris Mullin PF: Stephen Jackson C: Draymond Green  6th man: Juan Toscano-Anderson to rep Oakland.  While Kevin Durant was a truly great player for GSW, he was never quite the cultural fit that this prompt suggests."
Also related but I don’t see a logical explanation for why adding Klay Thompson coming off two brutally deviating injuries in a row is going to bring them from just missing the playoffs to being title contenders.   Especially when you account for all the young talent that will be a year older.
Yeah but Philly &amp; Utah don't have Klay Thompson.
That'd be a helluva modern lineup:  PG- Gary Payton  SG- Michael Jordan  SF- Kobe Bryant  PF- Scottie Pippen  C- Draymond Green  6th- Klay Thompson
dude would be a superstar if he could dribble. he’s basically if klay thompson were kinda shitty.
"&gt; Jeff Green absorbed Joe Harris's powers and turn into Game 6 Klay Thompson  He had a more efficient shooting night from 3 than any playoff game Klay played in his life. Klay's best efficiency from beyond the arc that post-season was 6 of 9 against the Blazers, and he's had a few 5 of 6 type games in other years. Game 6 vs OKC Klay basically pulled a Steph going 11 for 18, which is both an all time high in makes and attempts for him from beyond the arc during the playoffs. I guess it just feels like he couldn't miss because the barrage came at the right time during the game."
"Klay ""Boats and Hoes"" Thompson"
I’m taking the jazz and suns over the 9 seed warriors with an added klay Thompson who missed the last two years back
oh yeah a klay thompson coming back from injury will sure make this low seed warriors into a strong mid tier
"I don't think so, not with this roster. Oubre is legitimately bad, let alone compared to KD.  Wiggins is much worse than even 35-year-old Iggy.  Even Looney was miles better in 2019.   The difference between a legitimate contender and this roster is much larger than Klay Thompson."
"I know I'm in a very small minority who thinks this, but Klay Thompson is one of the most overrated players in the NBA over the last half decade."
"klay ""skipper"" thompson"
"Klay Thompson did some play-by-play earlier this season, if that's what you're looking for? It was on TV though so unfortunately it's not the unfiltered commentary you're looking for"
Klay Thompson School of Thots and Philosophy.
A Klay Thompson type player would be ideal
"Lmao yeah bro, I’m sure the neutral TNT announcers and NBA players on twitter were mad the rockets lost, as if they had any horse in the race. I’m sure the nba admitted they were fouls for no reason.   We lost by single digits. There are 6 point swings on these plays. Klay thompson avoided foul trouble.   Also, Steph didn’t get fouled, if you see anything other then him getting ripped and diving for the ball you’re blind"
"Was just about to say that, like damn you’re on a sick boat with klay thompson and you’re scrolling on your phone?  Not only that, but what is with this weird habit of people having that “tick” to just mindlessly enter their phone to escape situations."
So your telling me Klay is not an elite scorer cause of 3 points? You put Klay Thompson on the Pistons he is putting up at least 25 a game
Klay Thompson
Klay Thompson just is the coolest guy alive
Nah. If it’s a top 50 player that don’t count. Fans will vote a injured klay Thompson over d mitch.
Klay Thompson is a national fucking treasure.
"Klay Thompson smoking a J and riding his boat in the afternoon is nothing like Jose getting smashed and doing coke, riding his boat at uncontrollable speeds near dawn.  But I agree I hope he is being responsible."
It’s very Klay Thompson to incriminate himself before Wiseman sleeps with the fishes
"I know it's all ""haha Klay Thompson does the weed"" but after what happened with Jose Fernandez I sincerely hope Klay is sober when operating his boat."
Klay “Dennis” thompson
"He's not a rookie anymore, but it's Klay Thompson, you don't talk back to Klay Thompson"
"I've only been watching since 2012 but I haven't missed a post season series in that time. For my money its the 2016 warriors vs the Thunder.   There's a bunch of things that happened here.   1. The Thunder crushed the 67 win Spurs in the second round. This set the stage as that Spurs team had one for the best defenses of the decade and with their big three all sacrificing, they found a good look nearly every possession. If D'antoni's suns were 7 seconds or less, Popavich's Spurs were 24 seconds: no less. A truly special team.   2. This was the **73 win warriors**. The greatest regular season of all time. To watch another team take them down 3/1 was unreal. I was mystified. I would have bet my house that they'd win the west and yet I saw them on the verge of losing a 5 game series.   3. The Klay Thompson game. Need I say more? This dude became a hall of famer for me in this game. I'll never forget where I was like it was 9/11.  4. The aftermath - this series changed the course of basketball for the next 4 years. I will always hate KD for his soft ass move, and I can thank this series for it."
"If I had to pick one guy to hangout with in the NBA, it’s Klay Thompson"
Lol. It’s not even the offseason and Klay Thompson is the biggest shit poster.
Klay Thompson.
"Klay Thompson, great catch and shoot and elite defense"
Klay Thompson and whoever beats PatBev
"Personally, I think it's someone like Paul George or Klay Thompson. Both are elite shooters that provide great defense and the ability to create their own shots. I think that would be the ideal partner for LeBron James in this era."
I fear Hawks more than Bucks.  Ive seen enough Suns vs Bucks games where the Bucks didn't have enough fire power and Ayton was able to prevent Giannis from going 40 points on 70% efficiency.... The devil you know... Basically.  Hawks?  With Trae Young's ability to shoot from anywhere half court... And John Collins get key offensive rebounds out of nowhere... And also Huerter channeling mini Klay Thompson offensively.... They are more unprecitable.  Losing Hunter was huge though as he was big against the Suns last time they played.
"Most coaches run other schemes these days because defenses are allowed to play zone (aka guard an area of the court vs having to actively guard an opponent). While chasing through screens is effective, particularly against off-ball shooters (like say Rip Hamilton or Klay Thompson), these days coaches (in general) would rather switch the screen than let the ballhandler have the time to get off a shot that would happen while chasing through a screen.  But that really is coach dependent, teams like Milwaukee or Utah tend to chase go over screens and bring their center up to hedge. Other teams, like the Lakers or the Warriors almost prefer to switch on P&amp;R."
"Damn, that's actually a much worse than it looks initially when you reexamine draft... when Kawhi, Klay, Butler, Kemba and Vucevic were still on the board. Hell even Tobias Harris or Isaiah Thomas. That was actually a great draft, a ton of role players that could contribute to championship level teams - the Morris twins, Reggie Jackson, Tristan Thompson, Bogdanovic. The odds were actually in your favour that year to get something worthwhile. Sorry that sucks."
"Yep, easy to see ""Klay Thompson - 2012"" on the list and go ""holy shit"" and think this select team is way worse, but in the summer of 2012, Klay Thompson was a former 11th overall pick that averaged 12.5 PPG as a rookie. Certainly not a big name star or anything."
"Mychal Thompson is still a better player for his career than Klay has been, and that's crazy given, you know, that its Klay Thompson."
"I love Klay Thompson, but I’ve heard a lot of “When Klay is back the Warriors will be scary,” and I personally don’t know how much he raises their ceiling from Play-In team to contender off of a two-year, two knee-injury lay-off"
"Klay Thompson, Kelly Oubre Jr., and Wiseman all out with injuries."
Kawhi Leonard and Klay Thompson. Why is the prevailing assumption these guys will be good and consistently available when they next play?
"RJ has more potential as a three level scorer, and offense raises your ceiling more than defense. OG is great but he looks like he'll be an elite 3&amp;D player. If OG could become a Klay Thompson type, RJ could become a Jayson Tatum type. However, OG is closer than RJ is to reaching his potential so far.   This year I'd take OG for now based on what we've seen in the past, but RJ could very easily make that leap and be more valuable this year, and I see him as having more potential going forward"
And I will buy and read the hell out of that Klay Thompson book
"Damn, thought Lebron was gonna be used like klay thompson"
"I saw Klay Thompson at a restaurant in Oakland and as I walked by I just said ""I'm a huge fan. Keep it going!"" or something like that (it was before any of the championships). I felt so silly afterwards that I needed to interject myself into his dinner."
"Stein makes 32 selections.  Locks:  * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Kobe Bryant * Stephen Curry * Tim Duncan * Kevin Durant * Kevin Garnett * James Harden * Allen Iverson * LeBron James * Nikola Jokić * Kawhi Leonard * Steve Nash * Dirk Nowitzki * Dwyane Wade * Russell Westbrook  Non-locks:  * Ray Allen  * Carmelo Anthony  * Chris Bosh  * Vince Carter  * Alex English  * Pau Gasol  * Manu Ginobili  * Draymond Green  * Kyrie Irving  * Jason Kidd  * Reggie Miller  * Tony Parker  * Chris Paul  * Gary Payton  * Paul Pierce  * Dennis Rodman  * Klay Thompson  Not sure how one can justify picking Klay over McGrady, Dwight, Billups, Dantley, Dumars, AD, or Webber."
"It was huge, but at the time the Wizards were looking good with Wall, Beal and Otto Porter. If game 7 Kelly Olynyk didn’t turn into game 6 Klay Thompson, the Wizards go to the conference finals. Wall and Porter got injured and it all fell apart for Washington."
According to this article:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/klay-thompson-only-needs-0-79-seconds-to-beat-you/amp/  You’re full of shit and talking out your ass.
"You think prime Duncan, Parker and Ginobili to old Big Z, Varajao, and Boobie is a bigger discrepancy than:  Prime Curry, KD, Klay, and Draymond vs. washed Love, Tristian Thompson, Kyle Korver, and JR Smith?"
"The model also says Klay Thompson is a “scrub,” so..."
Klay “High on a Boat With His Dog” Thompson
"&gt;There’s a huge difference between starting over Devonte Graham and Malik Monk and starting over Klay Thompson. No matter what he does he wouldn’t start. That seems frustrating.  Klay can play the 3. It's not even about starting, it's about PT. They can roll out a Steph/Melo/Klay/Dray/Whoever center as the death lineup and that team will score a shit ton of points. Sure the defense might not be as good but you're gonna smother teams with offense.  &gt;But he will adjust. It normally takes bigs longer than other positions without Covid screwing up practices. And for a big his shooting is actually very promising.  It's not just about the skills, dude looked absolutely lost out there. And it's not even about the fit, it's about production. If Wiseman did produce last year they can either keep him or package him and some salary for a superstar. Now they have no choice but to develop him, no one wants him. That won't be the case with Ball, a shit ton of options would have opened up this year."
"&gt; Ball didn't even start in Charlotte, he had to earn that. I think with GS he would have the same path. The moment he clicks with Steph is the moment he'll start.   There’s a huge difference between starting over Devonte Graham and Malik Monk and starting over Klay Thompson. No matter what he does he wouldn’t start. That seems frustrating.   &gt; But even if he doesn't start he'll still provide the continuity of the ball/player movement because of his high BBIQ.  That’s true but is that good value at the #2 draft pick? A high-end bench player?  &gt; Wiseman had obvious trouble adjusting to the NBA pace, homie can't even shoot. They gave him the starting job outright, and eventually got demoted.  But he will adjust. It normally takes bigs longer than other positions without Covid screwing up practices. And for a big his shooting is actually very promising.  &gt; Isn't this the reason why people are so down on him pre-draft? But still he was stuffing the stat sheet and showing that elite playmaking skill...plus unlike his brother, he doesn't shy away from contact and actually drives to the hoop to try to score and not just pass.  I get that but the shooting and defense is a HUGE concern for the Warriors last season when you know he’s gonna be a net negative (all rookies are) and you are playing him with Curry on defense and Dray on offense. 3 sub 30% shooters on the court with Curry just isn’t going to work. Now if he’s a bench player the only problem is you are using your best pick you want to get for the next decade on a bench player for the next near half decade."
I highly doubt Klay Thompson will come off of the bench for the warriors
Paul George and klay Thompson are the best 2nd options in the league
"Klay Thompson, game 6 WCF in 2016 at OKC - they had been humiliated in games 3&amp;4 and as a team didn’t look great in this one.  Without some incredible 3’s down the stretch by Klay there’s no way they win"
Klay Thompson in Game 6 of the Western Conference Finals against OKC in 2017. That man willed the team to a game 7.
“Wasn’t healthy” this is revisionist history at its fucking finest lmaoo  He averaged 26 ppg on 54/57/88 shooting. He looked fucking incredibly when he played and only missed game 2 for precautionary reasons. The Warriors still lost 16 of the 18 quarters that Klay Thompson played in that series.
I'd still take a Klay Thompson-esque Booker plus Luka over Booker/Ayton tho
Jordan Poole is looking solid this season and promises to be a valid asset. It will be interesting to see how they fit Klay Thompson once he returns.
1.Steph Curry 2. Tim Hardaway 3. Alonzo Mourning 4. Shawn Kemp 5. Tie: Gary Payton/Klay Thompson
"Draymond has 3 rings because of Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. Dirk had way less help from his supporting cast. Do you honestly think that if Draymond played in Dirk's place on those Mavericks teams that he would even have 1 ring? I highly doubt it. Dirk helped revolutionize the game. He paved the way for players like Giannis and Luka. If you are measuring greatness by rings alone, that is very inaccurate list."
"Dude did a triple-double without points and missed 5x5 by a point. Versatile on both ends. Also was the top scorer in a FINALS GAME 7 that featured LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Kyrie Irving. That's nuts."
Someone doesn't think much of Klay Thompson to leave him off this list and put Curry top 10 and Dray top 30...
1. Kobe 2. Shaq 3. Ja Morant 4. Pau Gasol 5. Klay Thompson
1. Jason Richardson 2. Stephen Curry 3. Klay Thompson 4. Jordan Poole 5. Eric Floyd
1. Steph Curry and it's not even close 2. LeBron James 3. Vince Carter 4. Allen Iverson 5. Klay Thompson
"0. Steph Curry  1. Luka Doncic  2. Steve Nash  3. Klay Thompson  4. Ray Allen  Honorable Mentions: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Zach Lavine, Kobe Bryant"
"Klay Thompson, whenever he comes back he's going to have that one random Game of the Year where he just goes nuclear"
&gt;KLAY THROMSON!  THROMSON is one of my favorite players. He's actually so much better than the more well known Klay Thompson.
"1. Who wants to die today?  2. Hey-ya hey!  3. Klay Thompson scaffolding interview  4. ?  5. Game, series, Toronto has won!  6. ?  7. Drake and Draymond  8. I love it!  9.

Hilarious story about Klay Thompson?  To the front page you go.
"Klay Thompson, he hasn't missed a shot this season."
"mods please automod this before brigaders come in here and tell me LeBrons not allowed to care about black lives because he's not stopping forced labour in China.  THAT BEING SAID, if there is clear evidence of forced labour being used to create Anta, Li-Ning, and Peak, then any sponsored players should absolutely cut ties, and the NBA needs to cut any ""official"" ties with the companies.    I also see that its easier said than done for low level players who might not be making much money, but I think players like Klay Thompson should absolutely take the step."
Klay Thompson
"Klay Thompson is your flair, if you wanna talk parental advantages."
"They should pick up draymond green, iguodala, and klay thompson"
"I know  you’ve seen more Clippers this year than I have, but I can’t help but think curry might actually be great for this team. First of all there’s much less overlap between curry and PG than Kawhi/PG.  And I can’t help but think a curry/Bev/PG/Morris/Zubac lineup would be awesome  PG could be Klay Thompson at times and secondary ball handler/drive to the paint at times, and I think could still put up a 25/7/4"
Klay Thompson in shambles
"The only reason I say argurably because some fans will argue that Klay is a better shooter than Lillard  Thompson is the best catch and shoot player in the league ( when healthy ) easily , but in a scenario with no Steph , Lillard is the best easily"
Neither of the guys injured that year had any sort of rough injury history as well lol. I mean ffs Klay Thompson was the definition of iron man before that injury.
"Every time I see Klay Thompson, I remember the guy that pretended to be him. Lmao they look so muck alike"
yeah such a shame GS gave Curry a roster capable of winning 3 championships and then chose to have Klay Thompson miss 2 seasons in a row so they could get lotto picks.. that team is surely never gonna come close to the playoffs ever again..
"Damn dsmn, what an awesome game! So hype, shot after shot. What can I say, nuggets have the better team and pulled it off. What a waste by Portland of an epic historic performance by Dame.   This man could not miss, I was in shock and awe. Its too bad his teammates are so trash around him. If he had a competent 2nd guy, someone like klay Thompson, I bet Portland would have deeper runs in playoffs and might win. CJ is not the right guy for this team. Hope they can trade him so Dame can shine"
He was lucky Klay Thompson got injured in that game 6 vs. the Raptors. He was hot that game and Warriors could have forced a game 7. He would have been crucified if they won without him.
"Man it's half time, and Lakers have scored 36 only. I mean, Klay Thompson scored 37 in a quarter, sure it was one of his best performances ever but still.  37 in a quarter vs 36 by a team in a half really puts into perspective how mentally down the Lakers are."
Teams win plenty without one of their star players. That’s like saying the warriors shouldn’t have won any games this year because they are missing Klay Thompson. If Lebron is as good as everyone says he is then he should be able to step up and be a role model for everyone else on the lakers and get them to all play as a team and win even without AD. I think some of the other players have issues being on the team with Lebron especially after he said he would have gladly traded half the team to get Anthony Davis. Lonzo even spoke up a while back and said Lebron isn’t the best team mate.
"AUSTIN ""STEPH 'KLAY THOMPSON' CURRY"" RIVERS"
klay thompson is a hall of famer lol that’s pretty good potential
"Yeah seriously, he has klay Thompson potential at best"
"Klay Thompson  Edit: Actually I have a better one, Kyle Lowry"
"Klay Thompson. People act like he doesn’t do anything but shoot threes, but dude is like 53% on fadaways and 55% on all turnarounds."
did klay thompson die?
"&gt;  you guys couldnt even win one game against GS and KD wasnt even playing.  ...the series before we beat Denver starting Enes Kanter.  Then people are somehow shocked we don't do better playing Dame, CJ, and Enes Kanter vs Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green while Dame is playing with a separated rib.    Our center rotation that series was Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard.  We went from starting Aminu, Mo Harkless, and Enes Kanter to Norman Powell, Robert Covington, and Jusuf Nurkic."
Klay and Rocco Thompson!
"I mean, Ariza, RoCo, Wes Matthews, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Patrick Beverley, PJ Tucker... all guys who were pretty solid in both aspects in their primes (some of them still are), and I wouldn’t really call any of them “stars.” The only really “star” I think of when I hear the “3&amp;D” label is Klay Thompson.  Edit: I misunderstood what you were calling “overrated”; that’s my bad."
Klay Thompson
"Yeah and what you said was flat out wrong..  quote ""I’m just saying it’s a fact that shots where you don’t have to move your feet are easier than shots when you do have to move your feet.""  Have you ever actually played basketball? Nearly every player will prefer to move there feet to get them set in the right position before taking a 3 point shot, sure it's possible to catch &amp; shoot a 3 without moving your feet, but its not optimal.  This is only one player, but to illustrate the point, here's a 5 minute video of Klay Thompson catching &amp; shooting and notice that he moves his feet in nearly every case, as he catches or just after catching the ball, the foot movement is a part of the 3 point shot:- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_FKG0vhbyiY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FKG0vhbyiY)  Now if you had said ""Its a fact that shooting the ball with your feet set are easier then shots where they aren't"", then I could get behind the argument you're making."
"Just 4-5 years ago this team would've killed  C: Rudy Gobert / DeAndre Jordan / Clint Capella / Jusuf Nurkic  PF: Kevin Love / Serge Ibaka / Zach Randolph  SF: Jae Crowder / Tim Hardaway Jr. / Khris Middleton  SG: Klay Thompson / Buddy Hield / Gary Harris  PG: Jrue Holiday / Tony Parker  Love, Holiday, Klay and Gobert were all all star level players in '16-18"
Give me   Steph Curry/Michael Jordan/Klay Thompson/LeBron James/Kareem Abdul Jabbar   I've always said Klay will get you more mileage out of being the fifth best player of a GOAT lineup than any of the actual GOATs.
Where were you when Grayson Allen became possessed by Klay Thompson
"Jimmy wouldn't be out of a leadership role. Steph, Klay, Draymond, and Jimmy would all be leaders of the team. It's been awhile, but it would just be a veteran group where you don't need someone like Butler to be a strong leader like you do on a younger team like Miami or Minnesota. This would be more similar to the 2000s Pistons or KG Celtics. That's the brillaince of having a bunch of win-now veterans, none of them need their handheld.   As for the lockerroom dynamic, Butler is actually friends with Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. They all played together on the 2016 Olympics team.   I'd guess Iguodala will sign with the Warriors for the minimum this summer as well, so you will be bringing in another guy whose worked with both parties if this trade were to happen."
"This is actually a very good list until Scottie Pippen at 19.  It's doubly astounding that you ranked Scottie over David Robinson because their primes overlapped. Like literally in Scotties ""best year ever"" when he finished 3rd in MVP without Jordan, Robinson was the guy who actually won the MVP that year,  averaging 30/13/4/3/4 on a 60 win team.   It would be like ranking Klay Thompson over Giannis today. Like you're objectively wrong with Scottie over DRob. Anyone who saw them play would laugh at that. let alone DWade, KG, and all the other MVPs you've got under Scottie."
He also choked last year and was a Klay Thompson injury away from choking the year before.
Corey Kispert for sure going round 1. Very Klay Thompson like.
"""only superstar on a team"" leaves a lot of desired context.   For example, Kawhi with the Raptors didn't have a ""superstar"" teammate but at the same time he joined a team that won 60 games without him the season before where he could ""load manage"" half the season and the team still hummed along to 60 wins again.   For Curry, he didn't have a ""superstar"" but he had literally one of the greatest shooters of all time as a teammate in Klay and one of the best point forwards in the league in Draymond. Both were elite defenders.   Are you saying , In both scenerios one of the tier two guys like Harden couldn't win a ring with those circumstances? You don't think Harden can join a team that won 60 games the season before and lead them to a ring? You don't think Harden can't win with peak Klay Thompson and Draymond?"
"I can say it because I have watched them both play enough to know what I am watching. Klay Thompson is an excellent defender. Thybulle is one of the most gifted defensive players I have ever seen. If he could shoot like Klay, he would get enough minutes to be a perennial DPOY candidate."
Hes been saying this early in the season that he will try to emulate Boris Diaw but ended up emulating prime klay thompson from the deep. What a scrub /s
klay thompson is my spirit animal
if tim hardaway jr isn’t shooting like klay thompson mavericks could be in trouble
Ah yes known villain and evil guy Klay Thompson
I can't think of someone more injury prone over a longer timespan. Klay Thompson maybe but that's only last few years. KD has missed almost two full seasons I think. Porzingus maybe.
"Both KD and Paul George are at the top of that list but to add new ones I’d say Klay Thompson, Joel Embiid, Zion Williamson"
"Yes yes Aminu, harkless, and Meyers Leonard the same thing as Norman Powell, Roco, and Nurkic   Not to mention “warriors without their best player” is literally still Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green"
They be having AD posted up on the corner like he’s Klay Thompson with Drummond holy shit.
Lmao the two people I was gonna say were Beal or Klay Thompson depending on if you wanted the shot creator scorer vs 3 and d stereotype. Maybe also like Zach Lavine?
Yeah you're talking about a better defending Klay Thompson with a little bit less shooting ability but more athleticism and much younger
So I don't really watch Hawks bball. Is Huerter still good? I heard Klay Thompson comparisons when he was a rookie...
"he played with bums in the last 5 years. draymond, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, James Harden, Kyrie Irving. Trash teams but he carried them"
You think thats bad? Try winning next to Klay Thompson
"You really think it’s all that simple, honestly? I mean Jae was a big loss, but he also turned into an unsustainable Klay Thompson clone in the bubble. I mean he hasn’t been the same caliber guy in Phoenix.   Look. I mean no slight against your organization. You don’t need me to tell you what you’ve accomplished in the last twenty years. And you’re currently sitting with a top three coach in the league. I have nothing but respect for you guys.    At the same time, I think Jimmy is a unique leader whose style of leadership was uniquely beneficial in the bubble.   And it’s not just you. Look at at TJ Warren. Look at Murray. And more just at unsustainable shooting rates. We saw it this season with no fans, too.   Cheers, man. Not attacking your organization. Just think the bubble was a very unique setting that produced very unique results."
"Damn imagine being that stupid^   How the hell did dame, CJ, aminu, and mo harkless not win more games against Steph curry, klay Thompson, and draymond green!!   Our center rotation was literally enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard   Not to mention dame separated his ribs game 2 of that series"
I was talking about Klay Thompson.....'s teammate Damion Lee
The heat called him the second coming of klay Thompson. Wooo boy.
"Most guys in the league don't win shit, especially with LeBron and KD constantly stacking the deck in their favor.  Since Jimmy's been in the league, six players have been the best player on a finals team - LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, and Jimmy Butler.  Since Jimmy's been in the league, the only players that have won shit are LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyle Lowry, and Anthony Davis."
Bryn Forbes just decided to be Klay Thompson in this series
bucks got better and Jae Crowder isnt there doing a klay thompson impression
"It's not the most unbelievable thing that a world-class athlete could commit assault with a torn ACL. Klay Thompson was running up and down the tunnel in the Finals after he tore his ACL. Deshaun Watson played an entire football game against South Carolina with a torn ACL. I'm not making any kind of comment on the accusations because I don't really know that much about them, but I wouldn't necessarily assume they were false just based on that."
"In no particular order, Kevin Love, John Wall, Russell Westbrook (debatable), Kemba Walker (unfortunately), Klay Thompson (mostly injuries though), Otto Porter Jr. (his contract is almost up),  and KP.  Also, Wiggins until recently, Steven Adams (sadly), and I'm skeptical D'Lo returns decent value.   I know we give Bertans shit for his contract, but it's not like he's forgotten how to shoot. The Wiz just have insufficient spacing outside of him and Beal. They're just asking him to make 3-4 3's a game on high efficiency. He'd play better if they had even one or two more quality shooters in the rotation."
"Oh yeah there was poll this year by YouGov (there is an article written about the survey by business data journalist Graeme Bruce) this was a survey of Americans on who they thought was the greatest athlete in all sports of all time and Jordan came in 2nd after Muhamed Ali and Lebron was not even on the top 10. And when they narrowed that question down to just basketball fans the top three answers went 1) MJ 2) Magic 3) Kobe… so that is what I formed my statement. And a less scientific but very measurable stat that informed me how people feels about MJ is 19 years after his retirement his shoes sell more than that of Lebron, Durrant, Giannis, Klay Thompson &amp; Dwyane Wade combined."
I don’t have a horse in this race but I’d just like to point out that Curry was seeing double teams at half court in the Finals with Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson on the floor.
"Klay comes back to the Warriors, and with Steph+Dray+a player they trade for, Steph leads them to one final run and the media salivates giving Curry another MVP. He performs similarly to this season, with his numbers slightly lower due to Thompson returning, but the better record pushes it over the edge."
They should not trade Wiggins lmao   They might be able to get someone good if they land the pick for it and wiseman but they’re gonna likely replace Oubre with Klay Thompson so that should help
Surprised this didn't get a real answer with the exception of u/scottishere's comment [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nfrd7j/terry_rozier_went_09_behind_the_arc_tonight/gynvu4p?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

"You forgot Klay Thompson. Disagree with a few, but not a bad list."
They should get that dude who looks like [Fat Klay Thompson and fake everyone out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJqnpoJPDMM)
"He's a top rebounder for a PG but Westbrook getting 15 rebounds is less valuable than someone like Klay Thompson or Damian Lillard grabbing 15 rebounds.  Just watch the game, are you really that impressed by Westbrook being right under the rim with every Celtics player already back in transition after a shot attempt goes up, and he grabs the board with all the other players cleared out?  Clearly his team schemes for him to grab a ton of rebounds to initiate offense faster, not necessarily stat padding, but it's not THAT impressive.  Edit: He just got a sick putback, like I said he's an outstanding rebounder for a PG, but his RPG is definitely inflated... he averages more boards per minute than Tristian Thompson who is clearly a better rebounder."
"Your comment makes no sense. Please explain how my statements are “idiotic.” I just showed you the value he adds. I just think Jokic adds more value this season. Yet I can see how someone rationalizes Steph Bc he did it with less.   Also, the people voting on the mvp are not “experts” lmao. They don’t even watch the games except for a few marquee matchups. For example, Stephen A. Smith said he would trade Andrew Wiggins for a bucket of chicken. Anyone who knows basketball understands Wiggins impact and value to the warriors defensively. Another example is Rachel Nichols voting for Dwayne Wade to an all nba team in his retiring year instead of Klay Thompson. They don’t “know” basketball. They get paid to pretend they know basketball"
Honest question here.. people say the warriors are klay Thompson away from being contenders or steph is carrying the worst team in the nba to the 8th seed../ which one is it cause it can’t be both? Lol
"This is a controversial take but I agree. He definitely belongs in the HoF for being a pioneer in taking 3s and being a great shooter, but I feel like he's become quite overrated in recent years with the rise of analytics.     He was not good at creating off the dribble so he largely was an off-ball player and not the primary ballhandler. He's gained a lot of praise for his efficiency and shooting, but if you look at his TS% and EFG%, a significant portion of his efficiency was from flopping and drawing free throws.    For instance, Klay Thompson has a better EFG% of 55.1% while Reggie had a EFG% of 54.4. But Reggie crushes Klay in terms of TS%, 61.4% to 57.5%. While Reggie a better FT shooter than Klay, it was the volume that Reggie took FT's at that really helped him (FTr 0.402 vs 0.141 for Reggie vs Klay, by comparison Steph's FTr is 0.242). A free throw rate of 0.402 is really astounding for someone who was not a primary ball handler - it's comparable to LeBron's career FTr (0.404).    Indeed, the eye test backs this up. Reggie was notorious for his flopping back in the day and is widely considered to be one of the GOAT floppers. In fact, the NBA even created a rule after he retired to disallow the leg kick flop he did while shooting - the ""Reggie Miller rule."" People have selective memories about the ""tough 80s and 90s"" when many of the GOAT floppers were making their reputations.    Reggie's primarily off-ball shooting and flopping held up well too in the post-season, hence why his advanced stats stayed constant or improved. However, I think we should acknowledge that his RS and post season success, both personally and in terms of overall record, was the function of a well-crafted team around him which allowed him to maximize his off-ball shooting and flopping skills, especially since he was a poor ball handler and a decent defender at best. Avoiding the demands of on-ball creation and defense also greatly contributed to the longevity of his career. In many ways he was an ideal ""system"" player (a term I personally try to avoid in most cases since it's so often applied misleadingly, like with Steph or Kawhi earlier in their careers - it's clear that they ARE the system for each of their teams at this point)."
Hornets fans where were you when Doug McDermott turned into Klay Thompson?
Lol the warriors would have been so good this year if Klay Thompson could have played.
"Melo worked outta the high post and used his size and strength to bully ball people, Porter is much more of a spot up guy and a shooter, I never really considered Melo someone with considerable length, but there’s a lot of players with clean form and confidence in the league, like Klay Thompson and Melo aren’t close to the same but in your world they’d be identical"
"Oh god, the amount of people trying to get his attention is going to be worse than the Klay Thompson gilding stuff isn't it?"
"Yeah we basically teach to the Klay Thompson mold for higher level players, but some curry principles thrown in. I love teaching the legs stuff when kids get stronger cuz it really goes a long way and so many guys I know just tell every player that misses a shot to put more legs into it and I'm like....bruh the arms are what actually shoot the ball, fix that first!"
"sure but you know we're also living in the time of LeBron James, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, quite possibly Luka Doncic and Chris Paul and we also saw Kobe Bryant.  Fuck if Steph weren't around Klay Thompson would be getting discussed as the GOAT shooter."
"I'd give Westbrook All-NBA before Beal. Beal's a great player, but I don't think it's a coincidence that the Wizards started winning when Russ got healthy and flipped the triple-double switch. To me, Russ' playmaking has done more to get the Wizards' other players involved than Beal's scoring. Players like Daniel Gafford, Davis Bertans, Robin Lopez, Garrison Matthews (when he plays) all noticeably got better with Russ playing well. Beal's the Klay Thompson of this team, but Russ is the Steph Curry."
Klay Thompson is not better than Draymond Green.
Klay Thompson for Kevin Love
I’m going to take it a step further and say a healthy Dame is a more consistent shooter  than Klay Thompson
Chris Bosh was one of the best bigs in the league for over a decade. Klay Thompson has been a big part of the Warriors Dynasty and may very well go down as the second best shooter of all time when he retires. Like who cares if they were third bananas if they were dominant?   Did Rodman not deserve it? James Worthy? Ray Allen? Tommy Heinsohn? John Havlicek? Robert Parish? Tony Parker? Manu Ginobli? The list goes on. Greatness is greatness and its arguable that a lot of these guys may've had even more storied careers on their own.
Basketball hall of fame rewards guys like klay Thompson and Chris bosh too much. Neither of those guys were top 10 guys at any point but will make it. I don’t mind the international and college aspect  but I hate how 3rd bananas or even second on dynasty’s get in because of nostalgia and being on winning teams.
"Steve Kerr: holds the highest 3pt% in history, coached Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and KD  Also Steve Kerr: hates 3 pointers  ???"
Wonder how he'll play out when Klay Thompson steps on the floor next year.
"Everyone has, even Lebron, he’s just saying he thinks Steph was more valuable to his team which is a very reasonable point to make. Depends on what you value for MVP. If you want the best player who made the most impact on his teams success, it could go either way between the two. It’s only when you factor in team record that Jokic takes the lead and I’m sure Lebron hates the idea that a Klay Thompson injury is Curry’s biggest weak point in MVP this season as someone who’s had to carry many teams himself"
Danny green about tackled Klay Thompson mid airs in the finals and Klay got extremely hurt because of it. Danny Green is a dirty player. We win those finals with Klay not hurt only reason the sorry ass Raptors won
Most teams are terrible without their 2 best players because Klay Thompson matters dammit!   PLUS KD left them so basically losing their 3 best players. And they still have an amazing coach that created this offense for Steph. Context matters.
"PG13  Kyrie  Curry  KD  Harden (when not trying to draw fouls, see 2015-16)  Clippers CP3  Jordan  Hakeem  Carmelo  Joe Johnson  (I’ll name more as I remember them)  Edit: CJ McCollum how could I forget you man.  Klay Thompson"
Kyrie is the better player but you could argue Klay Thompson fits the role of a third option better since he doesn’t need the ball
"It’s not unreasonable considering the year Steph had. Literally the biggest knock against his MVP chances is that Klay Thompson was injured... if Klay was healthy and the Warriors were the 4 seed Steph’s chances to win MVP would go up immensely, even though Steph has no control over Klay’s health. That’s why the award is so weird to me. The Warriors were the worst team in the league last year, in games that Steph played this year they had a 48 win pace, and in games he was out they had an 8 win pace. He also won the scoring title averaging 32 PPG on 66% TS. Why is it “Jokic neglect” to say that Steph deserves MVP?"
"crazy that hes right up there in 3s with players like Steph Curry, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Steph Curry."
Next season Mulder's spot in the rotation gets taken by a dude called Klay Thompson
"When Klay set the record , Mychal Thompson said “on 24 shots? Seems like a lot...”"
Klay Thompson memories
A player has hit 10 or more threes 67 times. Curry is responsible for 22 of those games. Klay Thompson is second on the list with…5.
The nephews have forgotten who Klay Thompson is 😞
nah man what the hell happened to Jeff Green's shooting  he was bricking like crazy in all the april games now he's suddenly Klay Thompson
"VanVleet is roughly 5’11 Klay Thompson to me. But he definitely has his flaws.   Playing off ball, he’s amazing. We’ve seen it time and time again from going supernova in the playoffs to dropping 54 points on 11 made 3’s. His jumper is elite and his on-ball defense is potentially the best amongst guys his size in the league. True 3 and D stud.  But then there’s his weaknesses. It’s a block party whenever he drives to the rim. He has very little shot creation for himself yet likes to think he’s Kyrie Irving for long stretches. He’ll get supreme tunnel vision and it’s the most frustrating thing to watch in the world.   So he’s best in a specific role where he just plays off-ball and plays stellar defense but sadly he wants to be a lead playmaker which just isn’t the best role for him."
"Let’s be honest, after the hamstring injury in 18 and then cp3 underperforming in 19 having a former MVP seemed to make sense at the time. Chris Paul is a good player on a team with other good players. He is not a good number two to a superstar with a shitty surrounding cast. He’s no pippen, kyrie, ad, or klay thompson."
Klay Thompson
Everyone saw a light skinned 6-6 dude and thought he was the next Klay Thompson even if their games weren't remotely the same lol
"Whenever you mention Klay Thompson it is customary that before you speak, you raise both hands into the air, stand on your toes and praise the holy toaster. You will also be required to end every statement relevant to him with “Klaymen”"
"The greatest nickname I've ever read for Mulder was Mychal ""Steph 'Klay Thompson' Curry"" Mulder 🤣🤣🤣"
"I think the argument is not that he didn’t help those teams. His style of offense is great at getting an awful offensive team to a respectable level (similar to Allen Iverson). However, his style doesn’t scale well at making a good team into a championship level team the way someone like Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant do."
"Who were his best teammates? KLove? Tristan Thompson? Kyle Korver and JR Smith?   It was so bad that the ESPN graphic that showed each teams 3 best players as a promo for game 1, included Steph, Klay, and KD on the warriors, and LeBron, George Hill, and Kyle Korver for the Cavs."
"First and foremost Klay Thompson. Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, Shaun Livingston, Nick Young, Kevon Looney, Quinn Cook, Jordan Bell, Zaza Pachulia, Patrick McCaw"
"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.  Players on Golden State hate Klay Thompson.  The first question to ask: why? Why do they all hate him? The obvious answer: forgot about him in his prime.  Likely explanation: I know that most them were around 14 or 15 years old. That means they only got into NBA basketball in the last couple years. So they never watched The Toaster in his prime.  And because they didn't watch him in his prime, they try to compensate for that by ignoring stat sheets and box scores. But here's the thing: basketball is played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""playing time"" or ""health"" I know they know nothing about basketball.  Klay's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.  So when I hear somebody say that the team is congratulating Andrew Wiggins over Klay, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Klay in his prime wouldn't do that. Unlike GSW players, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Klay is better.  They might be jealous of Klay's 3 rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest spot-up shooter in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Warriors fan who watched basketball in the 2010s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.  This team would make you think that Klay isn't even a top 75 player ever.  So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like Steph Curry The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Klay talk to the adults. Fair?"
isaiah thomas is the prime example of being done dirty. john wall got his max and doesn't have the obligation of a guy like simmons to fulfill his contract or the expectation of klay thompson to come back on the court.
"Just like Klay Thompson and his $80 million deal with the Chinese company, Anta"
Klay Thompson has a $80 million deal with Anta
So do we. Pat Williams and Coby White might not be Klay Thompson but that’s more defense and offense we have off the table. This while LaVine is playing with a torn thumb.   Fully healthy we’re probably not contenders but again don’t start crowning shit 12 games into the season.
