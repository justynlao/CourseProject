McDermott out for the game... Edmond Sumner needs playing time.
Weirdly edmond sumner too
I once saw Joel embiid get sent flying in a collision with Edmond Sumner. Who is a skinny young guard on the pacers.  Its crazy that Sumner is so strong
"They’re also starting Doug McDermott, Edmond Sumner and Justin Holiday. It’s nowhere near a typical starting lineup"
"The TNT guys are one thing, but it drives me up a wall when the actual analysts and play-by-play guys get names wrong, whether it's pronunciation or just simply not knowing the right name. I watched some of a Pacers game the other day, and I'm pretty sure the away team commentator kept calling Edmond Sumner ""Edwin."" Sure, he's not a star player, but he's been in the league four years and your job is to know this stuff. I hear Coby White get called Colby a lot too."
Edmond Sumner is good.
GET OUT OF THERE EDMOND SUMNER!
Shoutout to Edmond Sumner for being the primary defender on Curry majority of the game and doing a damn good job.

I can't believe 301 of you guys decided that Edmond Sumner was the best use of one of your votes
"He has modernized the offense, and he has done well utilizing Sabonis as an offensive hub while empowering Myles Turner more as well on the offensive end. He has leaned perhaps too heavily on starters, but it's also forgivable because IND is missing their leading scorer and Bubble God from last season, TJ Warren, and is without who would be the team's, arguably, third best player in Caris LeVert.   Basically, for the Pacers to win most games, they need a consistent outing from Brogdon and Sabonis, a good defensive performance from Turner, and either Justin Holiday or Doug McDoug to go 4-6 from three. IND is missing a lot of offense and a wing defender, so it's been even harder since the Oladipo trade.   LeVert might be back in a month, and Warren might be back in two. The only player to be worse since Nate's takeover has been Aaron Holiday. He has been crazy inconsistent, and I'm not sure how much blame to ascribe to Nate, but the fact Aaron has continually had more playing time than Edmond Sumner is slowly becoming a problem."
"Yeah what's the difference between playing against Sabonis, LeVert and Brogdon vs playing against Jeromy Lamb and whoever the fuck Edmond Sumner is? They're all NBA players!   Fuck outta here lol"
"1. Domantas Sabonis (best, not most valuable) 2. Myles Turner 3. Caris LeVert 4. Malcolm Brogdon 5. T.J. McConnell 6. Justin Holiday 7. Doug McDermott 8. **Edmond Sumner** 9. **Goga Bitadze** 10. Jeremy Lamb 11. Aaron Holiday"
"Edmond Sumner, Oshae Brissett, and Doug McDermott are officially apart of NBA history."
Bruh you missed out on watching Edmond Sumner ball tf out
Edmond Byron Sumner.
Edmond Sumner has been great. Justin Holiday 6-8 3 pointers. Aaron Holiday DNP CD.

That was Edmond Sumner
"On the Pacers there would be at least some developing youth and also maybe a couple proven guys to snag... 4 we keep for be for sure: Sabonis, Brogdon, Turner, Levert. I'd feel pretty sure we keep Warren and McConnell. From here I'd want to keep Edmond Sumner and Oshae Brissett.  So according to my list: Lamb, McDermott, Goga, and both Holidays are open. That's not bad at all (to draft from). And I could be wrong on my last two protections meaning Sumner or Brissett could be in this pool and both have been improving steadily. Goga might be one of the best young, unprotected bigs in the league and I could imagine him being very helpful to an expansion draft team."
Probably Edmond Sumner
"1. reggie miller  2. danny granger  3. lance stephenson  4. rashard lewis  5. terrell brandon  6. alvin williams  7. markelle fultz  8. shabazz muhammad  9. shareef abdur-rahim  10. cliff robinson, qwyntel woods, darius miles  if edmond sumner stays in indy for a long time, he will be on this list"
"Pacers shooting 46% or better:  Doug McDermott, Oshae Brissett, Justin Holiday, Domantas Sabonis, Malcolm Brogdon, T.J. McConnell, Edmond Sumner  Game MVP:  Terry Rozier"
"He’s had a few games where he’s shown some potential this year. However, by in large he regressed from what was a pretty decent rookie season. Minutes were taken from him by the likes of Edmond Sumner.  Holiday is short but has a nice wingspan and shows flashes as a popcorn scorer off the bench. I won’t be broken hearted if he stays or goes. Quite a shame as I thought he showed real promise at times in his rookie campaign."
"Barely anyone has said this. We all know what his issues were and we stand by them. Of course we're going to wish him the best, he's a nice dude.  The only people who are saying they never criticised him are people who barely go on the sub, and thrive off of negativity. We have like the most negative sub, every game thread had typical people who would complain and blame for no reason.  If you actually pay attention and go on our sub, you'll see that the main belief is that it was time to part ways.  Y'all motherfuckers don't watch us play.  Dude never utilised our shooters. We were 30th in 3-point attempts and I think 30th in FTA. He spammed PnR, even when Brogdon was driving into Bam. He liked ISO hero ball, with Oladipo handling the ball for 20 seconds before taking a long 2. He made no adjustments and let runs go on too far. We collapsed every 3rd quarter. He lost the locker room. He had no inbound plays, Brogdon even complimented Bjorkgren on drawing up plays. We never played our young guys, just look at Alize Johnson, Georges Niang, or Edmond Sumner.  His system works for Trae Young and Clint Capela, but it didn't work for us. You build a system around your players, not the other way around."
"Oh boy, more Aaron Holiday and Edmond Sumner!"
"What if when it comes to perimeter players, scoring actually is that much more important than the things you described?  Well, being an elite fast break player is nice if that's actually true. It sounds like one of those things people say.   Pulls up transition stats, sorts by points made, ctrl + f Ball not found. Yeah, Lonzo is so elite that he can't even score as much as Edmond Sumner. Good call."
Let me go onto the nets subreddit and suggest you send us harden for edmond sumner. Someone ban this loser
"You are way overvaluing Kuzma. Pacers are not gonna pay $13 million a year to a guy who averaged 13 and 6 and brings nothing of value to the Pacers that they don't already have. Plus, he'd come off the bench, so no, that contract is not reasonable for not only a bench player, but a guy who would be fighting for playing time with not only Warren, but also Justin Holiday and Edmond Sumner, at the SF position alone. PLUS, Kuzma has regressed the last 2 years. He averaged 5 point LESS the last 2 years, than he did in 2018.  You can keep him and his contract. No one wants it, especially in Indiana"

"Not beating any one of them 1v1, but if I just have to score one to win, I'd pick either IT (5'9"") or someone injured like Edmond Sumner, Onyeka Okongwu."
Edmond Sumner too.
"All my homies hate Doug McDermott, Edmond Sumner is our best friend now"
THT is like a shit Edmond Sumner
Edmond Sumner always held his own in that matchup
Bet the house on Edmond Sumner for MVP. Trust me.
