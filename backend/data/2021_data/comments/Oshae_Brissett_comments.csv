"Oshae Brissett had a couple vlogs that gave a little look into the bubble, the Raptors, and rookie duties."
"Westbrook gets almost 3 contested rebounds per game, which leads all guards by a decent margin. Josh Hart and Oshae Brissett are the only other players &gt;2 per game."
Oshae brissett is way better than Bennett
He's no Oshae Brissett
"Edmond Sumner, Oshae Brissett, and Doug McDermott are officially apart of NBA history."
"To split hairs even more, there are multiple High School teams that play there.  Indiana Pacer Oshae Brissett also went there but played for ""Athlete Institute Prep"", and former NBA player Ignas Brazdeikis went Orangeville Prep like Jamal. And Thon Maker was at Athlete Insitute Prep at the SAME time Jamal was at Orangeville, and they basically each ran a team.  &amp;#x200B;  Used to coach there and it is really a top notch org"

"I agree - I was shocked reading this article cause I only heard positives from Nate from our players and staff. I thought he'd do great in Indiana.  If what they say is true about Nate then yes that is shady shit, but I'm having my doubts about it. Oshae Brissett signed a 3 year deal with the Pacers, he played for Nate in Toronto and then again in Indy. Obviously he was playing for a job and wouldn't turn down a contract if offered, but I feel like that has some value towards Nate not being as awful as some of the things in this article says.  I absolutely believe he's lost the locker room, I just don't know what happened."
"Oshae Brissett is impressive man – the coaches clearly trust him, too, since he literally played the first 13 minutes without coming out. Great find by the Pacers FO"

Oshae Brissett finally reunited with Nate Bjorkgren
OSHAE BRISSETT
welcome to the Oshae Brissett era
Yep Oshae Brissett definitely deserved that contract.
Honestly I would definitely rather take a team assembled of the top 15 NCAA players than a team of:  Greg Whittington  Anžejs Pasečņiks  Will Magnay  Ashton Hagans  Theo Pinson  Ignas Brazdeikis  Keljin Blevins   Grant Riller  Gary Payton II  Jontay Porter  Malik Fitts  Oshae Brissett  Ray Spalding  Devon Dotson  Ty-Shon Alexander  Jalen Lecque  No coach ever plays all 15 players in a game so you only need the top 8 or 9 college players in the country. I guarantee that theres more than 8 college players in the NCAA who could enter the NBA right now and be better than the worst 15 NBA players.
1) Jordan Nwora - Bucks  2) Gorgui Dieng - Spurs  3) Ryan Arcidiacono - Bulls? (not sure if he was traded)  4) Keljin Blevins - not a clue  5) Tyrell Terry - not a clue  6) Brandon Goodwin - Hawks  7) Mo Wagner - Bulls  8) Oshae Brissett - Raptors?  9) Trent Forrest - Heat?  10) Wenyen Gabriel - Heat?
Chris Boucher  Khem Birch  Oshae Brissett  Anthony Bennett  Cory Joseph  Jamal Magloire
"On the Pacers there would be at least some developing youth and also maybe a couple proven guys to snag... 4 we keep for be for sure: Sabonis, Brogdon, Turner, Levert. I'd feel pretty sure we keep Warren and McConnell. From here I'd want to keep Edmond Sumner and Oshae Brissett.  So according to my list: Lamb, McDermott, Goga, and both Holidays are open. That's not bad at all (to draft from). And I could be wrong on my last two protections meaning Sumner or Brissett could be in this pool and both have been improving steadily. Goga might be one of the best young, unprotected bigs in the league and I could imagine him being very helpful to an expansion draft team."
Oshae Brissett. This is based purely off Fantasy NBA scores
"Among those who accepted the camp invitations: Golden State’s Andrew Wiggins, New York’s RJ Barrett, Memphis’ Dillon Brooks, Oklahoma City’s Luguentz Dort, Houston’s Kelly Olynyk, New Orleans’ Nickeil Walker-Alexander, and Indiana’s Oshae Brissett.  For some, like Barrett and Brooks, availability will obviously hinge on how far their teams advance in the NBA playoffs.  “There is no greater feeling in sports than the chance to represent your country on the highest international stage at the Olympic Games,” Canada senior men’s program general manager Rowan Barrett said. “Our players and staff fully recognize the unique opportunity that lies ahead of us and I would like to commend them for their dedication to playing for Canada this summer.”     Let's go"
I’m pretty sure oshae brissett is the best shooter. Shaq needs to actually watch the games.
siakam has never had a season like randle just had  but i also think its possible randle had a season of him just hitting complete meme shots  all in all im doubling down and choosing Oshae Brissett
"If everyone was healthy and wants to play we would have:   SGA, Murray, Wiggins, Dort, Boucher, Brooks, Barrett, Tristan Thompson, Khem Birch, Oshae Brissett, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell, NAW from the Pels, Cory Joseph"
Oshae Brissett from the Pacers was also playing great near the end of the season so him as well.
"My best case scenario Canada team  First line  Sga, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Chris Boucher, Kelly olynyk  Second line  Cory Joseph, Dillion Brooks, Lu dort, Brandon Clarke, Khem birch   Third line  Kevin pangos, Nickel Alexander-walker, oshae Brissett, Dwight powell and Tristan Thompson"
"He had literally no clue who Oshae Brissett was, but he knew that name was somewhere on the court. So Sumner and both Holidays got called Brissett."
We are ALL Oshae Brissett on this blessed day
"&gt;  Oladipo  And he barely played last year (and when he did, he really played terribly)  Their primary problem is that they never consolidated assets. They have like 11 guys who are pretty good rotation players.  And yeah, they had a ton of injury issues, and yeah, Oshae Brissett was a wonderful surprise late in the year, but...they just have too many guys who you're happy to play 20 minutes+ per night, and not enough guys you think should be on the court in the last 5 minutes of a game 7."
I am ALL Oshae Brissett on this blessed day
We are all Oshae Brissett on this blessed day
Every black guy on the Pacers was apparently Oshae Brissett during the first half
Kelan Martin was Oshae Brissett at some point
called Kelan Martin as Oshae Brissett early in the game while breathing intensely in my ear.
"*Black Indiana Pacer scores a basket*  The dementia-ridden, decrepit sexual assaulter: “Is this Oshae Brissett?”"
Everyone is oshae brissett to marv. Next thing you know he's going to be calling his wife brissett
Any Pacers bench player:     Marv: I diagnose you with Oshae Brissett
I don't think Marv could pick Brissett out of a choice of one picture.    He's already called two people who look nothing like him Oshae Brissett in Kelan and Justin Holiday.
Oshae Brissett is a great name
Quite the career turnaround for Oshae Brissett.  Gets released by his hometown Raptors after playing only sporadically the past few years.  Then ends up as a starter on a playoff team.  Good for him.
"Pacers' leading scorer of the postseason: Oshae Brissett, as NOT predicted pre-season, or mid-season, or really even late-season.  The Pacers have so many different possible looks, none of which work quite right yet."

Copy &amp; pasting what someone else responded to me elsewhere. I know a lot of r/NBA just isn’t familiar with Pacers play this year (and why should they be lol):  &gt;	Pacers had two dudes they signed from the G League this year and a second-round draft pick play significant minutes today. Oshae Brissett and Jakar Sampson played most of the defense on Anthony Davis. The Pacers lost by seven and were within three with two minutes to play.

oshae brissett is up there
Looks like [he withdrew from the team](https://www.tsn.ca/dillon-brooks-oshae-brissett-not-in-training-camp-with-canadian-national-team-1.1658118).
"Oshae Brissett - maybe never all star but he should be a solid starter and was a free agent halfway through this season. He brings a great defensive presence, energy, and we will need to see if his improved 3pt shot is for real."
"Oshae Brissett got put in the Indiana starting lineup and put up some pretty damn nice numbers in the second half of the season, averaging 13/7/1/1/1 on nice efficiency in the last 16 games he played (aka the ones he got real pt)."
"Could really use some front court. No tt, Kelly, Chris boucher, khem birch, oshae brissett, yikes"
"No way Masai agrees to giving up the 905.  Having our G League team be a 30 minute car drive from Scotiabank Arena has been instrumental in accelerating our prospects' development.   - Poetl  - Delon Wright  - Oshae Brissett  - Siakam  - FVV  - Powell  - Boucher  - Flynn  Are all players who have benefited from exposure to Raptors coaching staff/facilities while they were technically in the G League.  I think Boston is even a stretch, Montreal is 50+ miles further from Boston than Maine, and Maine is already almost 250 miles away."
"Impressed by a number of rookies, but I'm always surprised Oshae Brissett isn't getting more recognition. Great showing in Summer League, good season last year after latching on in Indy (13.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 1.1 steals, 1.2 blocks as a starter), had that 31 point game too. Hope he gets a more defined role this year."

"Always partial to the Pacers:  TJ McConnell, Chris Duarte, Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lamb, OShae Brissett"
"1. We're not doing much; as you can imagine we're looking to run it back more or less with a competent coach in Carlisle.   We drafted Duarte who's immediately going to be a rotational player. We lost Dougie McBuckets but signed Torrey Craig to help with the front court minutes and Oshae Brissett had enough of a promising end to the previous season that I could see him getting more minutes. We also retained TJ McConnell and will probably look to move Jeremy Lamb.  2. I guess I'm high on the Raptors because I think FVV is a solid guard. I think their lineup is pretty solid as is except for the fact that they're missing a center.   I'm not high on the Celtics though to put them in Tier 2 - they've continued to bleed talent over the past few years  4. I guess they're going to keep Simmons. If that's the case, they'll continue to be a solid regular season team and probably cap out at ECSF.  6. You're right. The East isn't as stacked as the West but a lot of teams in our conference have made major upgrades to their roster and fighting for playoff seeds is going to be difficult for any of my Tier 3 teams. Not looking forward to it."
"Surprised by the Bembry waiving, but I was surprised we got rid of Rondae last year as well.  I finally had one take that aged well: we should've held onto Oshae Brissett."
"Anunoby, he’s only 23 and has improved every year. He could average 18-20 points per game next season.  Kenyon Martin Jr., he had a solid rookie season and should be a bigger contributor with more minutes.  Oshae Brissett, he is a good shooter and should be a good bench piece for the Pacers next season."
Well good for Oshae Brissett man 🙌🏽
I hope the NBA isn’t shocked when Oshae Brissett is the leading scorer for the tournament because none of the key players take it seriously
No such thing as Europe as it pertains to basketball. The best G league players are bench warmers in the Swedish league? Here are some of the players playing in the g league last year: Kevin Porter Jr.  Jalen Green   jordan Poole.  Paul Reed.  Jared Harper.  Henry Ellenson.  Jeremy Lin.  Nico Manion.  Oshae Brissett.  Kobi Simmons.  KJ Martin.  Jalen Adams.  Vernon Carey jr Antonio Blakeney.   Any of these players can play for top European clubs. Some would dominate. Some actually signed with European clubs and many more were called up to the NBA. Some were sent for development and played a good 10-15 games.
We should only talk about Oshae Brissett.
When the answer is clearly Oshae Brissett or Chris Duarte
Malcolm Brogdon  Chris Duarte  Justin Holiday  Domantas Sabonis  Myles Turner  T.J. McConnell  Goga Bitadze  Oshae Brissett  Jeremy Lamb  Torrey Craig  Isaiah Jackson  Brad Wanamaker  Caris LeVert  DeJon Jarreau  T.J. Warren
"Even as a neutral fan, I was testing my hair out at the Oshae Brissett missed FTs in the 4th"
see that’s the thing our true second unit being some kind of comp of McConnell - Duarte - Justin Holiday - Torrey Craig - Goga/Jackson  with Oshae Brissett and Jeremy Lamb still behind them but in the mix - we’re a DEEP team   however it’s gonna be a mixed bag of injuries as it always is so not sure what the second unit will be
"Pacers starters: -18, -21, -20, -9, -15  Oshae Brissett: +20  Brad Wanamaker: +20  Jeremy Lamb: +21  Jesus H Christ this team is a disaster at the moment."
Why isn't Oshae Brissett heldto a higher standard? This is a “Top 75” player and is always mentioned in the top 5 best current players and can’t lead his team to any wins. Everyone is throwing blame at Sabonis and Turner but this should be Oshae's team. Oshae is supposed to lead this team to wins. With TJ Warren and Duarte out he does the same thing he did earlier in his career. Put up empty stats and get his team embarrassed and no one wants to talk about it.
