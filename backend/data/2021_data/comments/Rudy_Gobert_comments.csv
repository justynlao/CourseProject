"Did you even read the article or bother to look at any stats outside of blocks?  You’re pushing this narrative that people only think Myles should be dpoy because of blocks, when you yourself are only looking at blocks.  Myles is first in defensive raptor, holds opponents to the lowest fg% within 0-3 feet, and when he’s on the floor the Pacers have the best defensive rating in the league, meanwhile when he’s off the floor they’re 28th.  I’m a huge Gobert fan, so don’t take this as me saying Myles is a better defender than Rudy.  Rudy is still the biggest game changing defensive player in the league in my opinion.  It just really grinds my gears when people discredit the year Myles is having by saying he only chases blocks and then compare him to Hassan fucking Whiteside.  Give the man his damn respect.  You can hype up Rudy without tearing Myles down."
"Shaq’s claims about Gobert are bogus because if Rudy left the Jazz in the off-season, there’s no way in hell they’d be as high in the standings as they are now. He’s not an offensive threat only because we’re still in the 3-point era. But in a way we’re getting longevity out of inside terrors like Gobert, and Shaq’s era saw many guys like Gobert get burnt out by 30 because there was too much pressure on them to dunk on everyone and back down every night. That shit catches up with you very fast, especially if you’re nearly 7-feet or overweight(which we saw in the tail end of Shaq’s solid but mostly absent veteran play.)"
"kids, all you have to do is be rudy gobert and you can make a fucking truckload of money baby"
"uhhhh just off the top of my head, here are my picks:  Donovan Mitchell Rudy Gobert Royce O’neale Mike Conley Bojan Bogdanovic"
Rudy Gobert
"Rudy Gobert on the nets pretty much solves their interior defence problem, which is their biggest weakness by far.   Obviously you’d have to give up one of the nets big three, but if it was just gobert straight to the nets? You’d have KD able to go back to guarding wings, which he is much more suited for. Kyrie’s and Harden’s guard defence isn’t elite by any means, but they’re capable enough that they can play some good team defence if they have KD and (more importantly) Gobert to make up for when they overcommit."
Rudy gobert does it too.
"It’s because Rudy is a better help defender so they figured he could help Jokic’s man, but it didn’t work because Millsap and others were hitting threes. Also there was one play where Gobert should have helped but he got out of the lane to avoid a three second call"
"Did Dirk Nowitzki, Tony Parker, Giannis, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Peja Stojakovic, Arvydas Sabonis etc... all just fail to exist?"
Add Rudy Gobert for being patient zero
I think he can slow him down enough that it could just throw a wrench in the gears of the Sixers offense. Everything usually goes through him. This is Rudy Gobert we’re talking about — I don’t think he gets the respect he deserves
"This sub threw a hissyfit when a HOFer insulted Rudy Gobert.   Where was all that ""HOFers can say whatever they want"" when a Warriors player had to get his mommy to defend him after a HOFer made fun of him? And mommy wanted the HOFer suspended for being a big meanie on TV."
Most bigs get cooked at the perimeter though including Rudy Gobert.
Nikola Jokic and Rudy Gobert

"I don’t know if you’ve been watching basketball for 2 days or what’s the deal, but Rudy Gobert dpoy has no correlation and is completely irrelevant to Jokic being able to win mvp."
Rudy Gobert
Teams are scoring 14.5  less points per 100 when Rudy Gobert is on the court. Would definitely say him
Lmfao fuck Rudy Gobert
"It's two reasons I think (though not agreeing with them).  Shaq putting the focus on him, this sub loves drama so now they're looking to see those comments get backed up.  Secondly, I think people at least subconsciously still kinda dislike him cause of the Covid thing from last year. Which it's still crazy to think Rudy Gobert was basically the domino that caused our whole country lock down lol."
"That financial tie in only came about recently, and it's fucking stupid. It's how you end up having to pay Rudy Gobert insane money instead of just a lot of money."
"Rudy’s flaws are hyper-emphasized by fans compared to everyone you mentioned. Nearly every time Rudy has a poor play where somebody scores on him, it’s instantly made into a clip and highlighted on this sub. And yet literally no one cares when someone scores on or has a big game against AD, Giannis, Bam, etc.  At this point though I’m pretty much done trying to defend Rudy because it’s clear no one will stop the Gobert hate-train unless he wins a championship and is the clear FMVP."
"Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, Jakob Pöltl"
"Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, Lu Dort, Jrue Holiday, Ben Simmons"
Rudy Gobert: *Aight*
Based on more than half the teams having a center who is clearly better defensively...  1) Nikola Jokić - Denver Nuggets  2) Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers  3) Rudy Gobert - Utah Jazz  4) Jusuf Nurkic - Portland Trail Blazers  5) Nikola Vučević - Orlando Magic  6) DeAndre Ayton - Phoenix Suns  7) Jonas Valančiūnas - Memphis Grizzlies  8) Steven Adams - New Orleans Pelicans  9) Myles Turner - Indiana Pacers  10) Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks  11) Jarrett Allen - Cleveland Cavaliers  12) Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks  13) Karl Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves  14) Al Horford - Oklahoma City Thunder  15) Tristan Thompson - Boston Celtics
Rudy gobert? More lile Rudy dispair
"It didn't fit my narrative /s  For real though, the defensive metrics are actually a lot closer than I expected them to be. In their entire respective careers it's only like a difference of 1 in terms of DRTG. But I assume that playing in the 2000s inflates that DRTG a bit, just as Rudy playing in the 2010s/20s is inflating his ORTG a bit. Camby slightly blocks more shots per 100 possessions, but he also fouls more. Gobert grabs more boards by % on both sides of the floor. The biggest difference is when you factor in the offensive production and efficiency, giving Gobert a much higher net rating  Just for kicks, I also pulled up numbers for Mark Eaton. Compared to Gobert, they're both even in defensive rating for their careers, and all the other defensive metrics are very similar except, of course, Eaton's absurd shot blocking prowess"
"OP you didn’t even watch the game. Jokic probably scored 15 points against Gobert today.  And I’m not gonna lie, Jokic owns Gobert anyways. But he’s the best center in the NBA so all that negative shit about Rudy is just unnecessary. Stop being a hater and give Jokic credit without putting down someone else."
"Oh yea, there's dozens and dozens of reddit posts, youtube videos, podcasts, pundit segemnts, etc wondering ""Is Rudy Gobert Overrated?"" spanning a half a decade, but I guess it's still spicy for some people."
"when rudy is sitting on the bench and derrick favors is guarding jokic is that “other players helping him”?  again, it was a bad night for gobert, but he did not play during all of jokic’s minutes."
"Rudy was in a tough spot today. He couldn't put a hard challenge on Jokic's threes cuz Jokic would just spin around him, so one of two happened: 1) Jokic made the half-contested 3 or 2) Rudy moved up to challenge Jokic and he just blew past him for a 2 or a foul.  Jokic beat him in the paint more than the average match-up, as well. He made a lot of the contested shots he missed over Gobert/Favors last game."
"This was his most dominant performance over rudy, no doubt. I felt gobert did pretty damn well on Joker last game and in the playoffs, considering we let him guard him 1v1.  Today Jokic was unstoppable, and Rudy kinda played like ass. So did Spida for that matter"
Jokic always seems to make Rudy Gobert his son. He torched him in the first round too
Rudy Gobert
"were you watching the game? it was not a good game for gobert, but you’re acting like rudy was the only person guarding jokic."
 Jokic usually does slap up Gobert but the scheme on defence here seems to be keep Rudy closer to the paint where he’s most effective
Jokic made 2x DPOTY Rudy Gobert look silly.
"Nah the DPOY on a $200 million dollar contract rightfully deserves criticism. If lebron hung 33 in a half on kawhi, wed shit on kawhi too. Even the fact that gobert wasn't on him for a lot of plays is bad, bc the fucking 200 million DPOY C should be guarding fucking jokic, not crossmatched while favors gets clapped. Literally hiding a dpoy. Not to mention rudy does little on the offensive side, so he's getting paid almost entirely for the defense."
1. Rudy Gobert
neither do u if u think rudy gobert deserves 205 million dollars.
"Not even. It was Bogdanovic, which is way more disrespectful. I understand Quin does it so Rudy can help off a worse shooter and it worked against the Mavs and Porzingis, but I wish he'd just put Rudy on Jokic unless he's gonna play Gobert and Favors together."
"  ""From outside in you knew he was a great defensive player, that's kind of where I left it at, but after getting to know him and what he does for our team, he makes our team go, honestly,"" Conley said. ""He's the most important player on our team with his ability to get guys open on screens and sacrifice runs down the court.""  Lol fucking 1 loss and you could swear an 11 game winstreak was 3 years ago. The difference between the worst record in the East and the best record in the West isn't Mitchell/Beal; it's Rudy Gobert."
Well then watch the game? Due to how they rotate Jokic and Gobert only share the floor about half the time. We take Rudy and Conley out fairly early every first quarter while Denver leaves Jokic in almost the whole quarter. Only 3 of Jokic’s makes actually came with Rudy out there
Unbelievable watching him play right now. Especially against Rudy Gobert in the paint
Isn’t rudy gobert suppose to be the best defender in the league?
Rudy Gobert
"RPM in general has gotten weird. There seems to be a pretty big bias against big men. There are only 3 centers and 4 PFs above 2.0 RPM, with 12 Pgs, 9 SGs and 8 SFs. Even centers with good raw on/off and high efficiency are frequently given strongly negative ORPM. RPM also seems insanely biased towards offense. The top DRPM mark is 2.84 while there are 26 players with a higher ORPM than that, topping out at 7.7. Seems to be pretty structurally flawed rather than just small sample sizes. RPM can identify Rudy Gobert as the best defender in the league but it also rates him 67th player overall. Seems fundamentally broken to me."
"Wow. Managed to mention everyone by name that isn't Rudy Gobert, and has clearly not watched the last few games when Gobert absolutely dominated.  Gobert has all the offense we could possibly need. His defense is what allows our offense to flow. When he needs to he can score."
"jokic was dominant too  but its always ""dominated rudy gobert"" when a player or team does well against the jazz, even though there is a lot of nuance and shit since its a dynamic team game  but that is something i am totally happy to accept, because when a player or team sucks against the jazz im giving rudy gobert credit every time"
Oh wait he also dominated Rudy Gobert.    What next mate? Are you going to say Giannis has more abs and is better 😂😂😂😂
Joking was guarded by Zubac and Harrell lol. Why we acting like he dominated Joel Embiid or Rudy Gobert? Al Horford is so much better than Zubac.
Rudy Gobert. That doesn't have anything to do with the Kings though?
"I think the top 5 playing now are: Rudy Gobert, CJ Mccollum, Hassan Whiteside, Danny Green, and Fred VanVleet"
I’d take Rudy over Embiid any day of the week... in a three point contest. Gobert has never miss from behind the ark you know?
You literally have it backwards. Teams sell out to stop Rudy from dunking and it leads to open shots all night everywhere else. Also his screens give these guys a ridiculous advantage and he is their whole defensive system. So sick of casual fans spitting it out their garbage takes about Gobert. The man deserves more respect.
"Rudy Gobert is not the Jazz’s best player lmao   Kind of a stretch to call him a “star” as well. He’s good but I would say a star is someone even casual fans know/recognize, that’s not Rudy.   I’m very happy the center position is making a comeback tho."
Neither is Donovan Mitchell. Sure a player of that type is hypothetically more valuable then player like Rudy gobert but your forgetting the context of Donovan Mitchell being a lower end all star.
We'll take one Rudy Gobert for him.
"It will be interesting to see coming down the stretch of the season and hopefully into the playoffs, how it works for other teams planning for Demar. There’s a lot more around him for teams to account for than before. You plan for Demar and get BIG BODIED by Keldon, or your eyes cut out by Dejounte, or FIBA patty goes off, BLOKOB POETLE is basically Rudy Gobert, Lonnie streaks for 12 points in 3 min, Vaselle wrecks havoc on defense and hits 40% from 3. Not even mentioning if Lamarcus Frankenstein goes sleep walking for 20-30, and NOT THIS GUY Rudy Gay does exactly what he’s been doing all season. Spurs are good! Currently sitting 4th in the west and finding their stride.  Edit: And Derrick White is back! Time to groove."
"wow, 4 games? and offensive superstar rudy gobert wasn't the leading scorer in any of them?"
"The Rudy Gobert cycle:  -Start Season  -chad regular season, blocks tons of shots and boards well  -Jazz hype train builds  -wins dpoy  -takes on dominant pnr ball handler in postseason gets picked apart because he struggles guarding on the perimeter  -Everyone Shits on Gobert in offseason  -Start season"
"3P%, well 35% is what many consider the league average  FG% really depends on what kind of player you're talking about, and what kind of shots they're taking.   Big men who lives almost exclusively on a diet of offensive rebound putbacks, lobs &amp; shots very close to the rim? Anything below 55% is honestly unacceptable considering these are supposed to be easy shots, for reference Rudy Gobert who is such a player had FG% of 69% (nice) last season  Guys who take a huge majority of their shots from 3-point range, a FG% of above 40% is good enough. For example, Duncan Robinson who takes almost 9/10 shots from 3pt range has a FG% of 43% this season but that is fine because his 3pt% is elite (40%), the Heat will live with that"
"&gt;By asserting Bogut as some sort of counter-argument to the discussion, when he is actually a prime archetype of why people said the position was dying.  I've repeatedly expressed disagreement on what people ""thought"" about the position at the time. Many of those same people look at Rudy Gobert and are not impressed because he has no creation ability. The common fans evaluation of centers is limited to offense, NOT overall impact as many don't know how to assess overall impact to begin with in basketball let alone the position.    &gt;What they mean is DeAndre Jordan being a 1st team All-NBA Center, no center making a deep playoff run as the clear best player on their team, no superstar centers for years in the league, etc.  DeMarcus Cousins was better than Deandre Jordan, for one. You should know that media decided awards are not some end all test for player rankings. There's also a comparison to be made between Cousins and Towns regarding the lack of success for their respective teams, in contrast to their production and on/off metrics that support them being influential. If Cousins were someone else, would he have suddenly killed the ""death of the center"" narrative? Quite possibly. Certainly had the potential to be first team over Deandre Jordan!  Second, the very year after that Rudy Gobert emerged and Marc Gasol was clearly better than Jordan (an often forgotten part of this discussion). I'm not seeing role players in those two players. I'm not seeing a period where the best center in the league was a role player. That's kinda ridiculous.   &gt;He didn't revive anything, but subsequent players like Jokic and Embiid did, because the position did need reviving. They dispelled the notion of a center not being a position that could harbor a superstar, a clear best player on the team that hopes to contend.  That notion was stupid. Dwight Howard, despite all his offensive limitations, led the right supporting cast to the Finals. Of course another talented big could do the same. It just took the right player and the right environment.  ANYONE who denied that, was being an in the moment idiot, as are the people who thought the position was dying.  &gt;The notion of ""the death of a center"" was not one of people not posting up, it was a notion of centers being relegated to roleplayers in order to have team success. And this notion would persist still if DeAndre Jordan kept being the best center in the league and guys like Bogut at center were hallmarks of a competitive roster.  Deandre was never the best center in the league. We need to stop saying that. People who say that are the reason the ""death of the center"" was ever a thing."
"I mean DPOY it works because a lot of it is the eye test and impact. If Rudy Gobert was on the #1 defense Knicks and didn’t even make the playoffs, he’d still win DPOY, because it’s a measure of defensive impact, not team success and narrative.  But for the most part I agree with MVP, but it seems like you’re underselling   &gt; right mix of team record, stats, and narrative  Only the best players can do that lol. Therefore it’s still indicative of how good a player is, but not necessarily the best. Like I can use that in conversations, like “Giannis is better than Jokic” and use those two MVPs as an argument"
"Great recovery by Gobert. Luka might have had him if he'd put the shot up right after the initial pump fake, but the tiny hesitation after gave Rudy just enough time"
"Just say you didn’t watch it. Jokic is a MVP tier player and had to fucking adapt to Rudy gobert, Jokic would not go near the paint on offensive possessions. Gobert was phenomenal on him but Jokic is a wizard on offense, at the end of the day this was a bad take"

"Players voted Rudy Gobert as the best defender in 2018 and 2019.  I don't think they held a vote in 2020, or I can't find it at least."
rest of ex-yugo out here catching strays in a thread about rudy gobert
"It really is amazing how one single play 4 yrs ago, from the Reigning league MVP &amp; best guard of a generation against a young 7-1 center in his first playoffs, trying to guard him 1-on-1 &amp; 25' ft from the hoop; has convinced 90% of r/NBA that Rudy Gobert is actually a trash defender who can't guard away from the basket."
Just give r/nba a chance and they will list 7 players that have a bigger defensive impact than Rudy Gobert.
"He's not sharing the floor with Rudy by coincidence  They toghether just hit some levels of understanding and chemistry on both sides of the floor that's it's just nuts. They've been so good toghether that playing them separately outside of a situation as of these last two games (no Mitchell and Favors) doesn't even make sense  Also these Dallas games they've been not sharing the floor so much as we had no Mitchell and no Favors (thus the lineups been a bit different than with these two) and tonight Gobert had a lot of foul trouble, and Conley still rocked"
"I vote based on how well a player is playing and how much i think they deserve it and how impactful their play is... I dont vote for box office players just because theyre box office players. my list this year west: mike conley, steph curry, bron, AD, Rudy gobert.   east:  jaylen brown, harden, KD, Embiid, randle"
It’s almost all noise no guard is worth anywhere near this much defensively even the best defensive guards over large samples people like Ben Taylor will tell you are worth around 2 points per 100 poss defensively above replacement level. I just posted it because it’s a hilarious stat. Good for him though not his fault he plays with Rudy gobert
"Utah Jazz general manager Justin Zanik proudly waited outside the locker room after the final buzzer to give Rudy Gobert and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Friday evening. Injured guard Donovan Mitchell yelled out, “Aight. That's it.” Sharpshooter Bojan Bogdanović gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Mike Conley yelled out, “We got a [expletive] squad now.” And before Gobert hit the locker room door, former NBA great Carlos Boozer hugged him and said, “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.”"
I heard a number of Mavs fans treat late season KP who averaged 27 for a month as what KP is permanently going forward and why he’s better than Rudy gobert as an ex. When you set that up as the standard and rationalize his play so only the good stretches count your just setting yourself up for disappointment
No but ironically Rudy Gobert should be..
Rudy Gobert is EVERYWHERE
Rudy is to Porzingis what Rockets fans think Harden is to Gobert.  Dude can't guard him.
"For what it's worth, [bbref's MVP tracker](https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/mvp.html) (which tries to predict who voters will pick, not who deserves it) has Jokic as a heavy favorite for MVP so far.  |Rk|Player|Tm|W|L|W/L%|G|GS|MP|FG|FGA|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|2P|2PA|2P%|eFG%|FT|FTA|FT%|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS||Prob%| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Nikola Jokic|DEN|11|7|.611|18|18|35.5|9.7|17.1|.567|1.1|3.2|.328|8.6|13.8|.622|.598|4.8|5.7|.843|3.3|8.5|11.8|8.9|1.8|0.6|4.0|3.1|25.2||47.7%| |2|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|14|5|.737|15|15|34.5|9.5|18.9|.505|2.1|4.9|.419|7.5|13.9|.536|.560|4.8|5.3|.900|1.0|4.4|5.4|5.7|2.0|0.7|1.8|1.7|25.9||13.1%| |3|Joel Embiid|PHI|13|6|.684|15|15|32.0|8.7|16.0|.546|1.2|3.0|.400|7.5|13.0|.579|.583|9.1|10.9|.834|1.8|9.3|11.1|2.8|1.2|1.4|3.3|2.4|27.7||12.4%| |4|LeBron James|LAL|14|6|.700|20|20|33.1|9.3|18.8|.496|2.8|6.6|.417|6.6|12.2|.539|.569|4.1|5.8|.713|0.7|7.1|7.8|7.5|0.9|0.4|3.6|1.5|25.5||6.9%| |5|Kevin Durant|BRK|12|8|.600|15|15|36.7|10.3|20.0|.517|2.9|6.6|.444|7.4|13.4|.552|.590|6.9|8.1|.860|0.5|7.0|7.5|5.5|0.7|1.5|3.3|2.1|30.5||5.4%| |6|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|11|6|.647|16|16|32.6|9.8|17.9|.547|1.3|4.4|.296|8.5|13.5|.630|.584|5.9|10.1|.584|1.7|9.3|11.0|5.6|1.1|1.1|4.0|3.4|26.8||3.8%| |7|Anthony Davis|LAL|14|6|.700|17|17|32.8|8.5|16.2|.522|0.9|2.7|.326|7.6|13.5|.561|.549|4.1|5.7|.711|1.8|7.0|8.8|3.5|1.3|1.9|1.8|1.8|21.9||3.2%| |8|Rudy Gobert|UTA|14|4|.778|18|18|30.4|5.4|8.9|.602|0.0|0.0||5.4|8.9|.602|.602|2.6|5.1|.511|3.8|10.4|14.2|1.4|0.6|2.8|1.4|1.9|13.4||2.6%| |9|Paul George|LAC|14|5|.737|16|16|34.3|7.9|15.8|.504|3.8|7.8|.484|4.2|8.0|.523|.623|4.3|4.7|.907|0.5|5.7|6.2|5.4|1.2|0.5|4.0|2.1|23.9||2.5%| |10|Khris Middleton|MIL|11|6|.647|17|17|33.0|8.2|15.8|.519|2.6|6.0|.441|5.5|9.8|.566|.603|2.9|3.1|.925|1.0|5.5|6.5|5.8|1.0|0.2|2.2|2.7|21.9||2.4%|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/mvp.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#players) Generated 1/29/2021."
"Idk, Gobert has been amazing too.  I love Mitchell, but he's been streaky this year so far.  If I have to choose two Jazz players for all star at this point, I gotta go Rudy and Mountain Mike!"
Cannot believe u just said rudy gobert is better than Paul George.. and I dont even like Paul George
"I mean the Kuzma comment was obviously hyperbole.  But in all seriousness, you've got some gaps in your knowledge base if you think Paul George is better for a team than Rudy Gobert.   I don't mean that as disrespect in any way, I just think maybe you haven't sat down &amp; actually watched Gobert enough to see how impactful he is, or something.   Fact is, the Utah Jazz are a team literally built around Rudy Gobert, and they're one of the best teams in the NBA.   Paul George has never been the centerpiece of a team that had the success Utah has had w/Gobert. &amp; at the end of the day, there isn't a GM in basketball that wouldn't take Gobert over PG13 to build a team around."
"Who is a better defensive Center then?   I can see an argument for David Robinson &amp; Dikembe Mutombo maybe, but I'm old &amp; have been watching the game religiously long enough to remember Bernard King winning scoring titles.   I've never seen a player consistently impact &amp; dominate the entire game defensively like Rudy Gobert does."
"Players score points, teams get wins.    Luka and curry aren’t playing with Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert"
"The backlash has grown a lot recently with Shaq's recent ridiculous comments on Christian Wood, Rudy Gobert, and Donovan Mitchell, but yes there's a minority of us that dislike how low-level their commentary is and how they are *legitimately clueless about and apathetic at best towards* the modern NBA."
Regular season. You ignored the playoff stats.   In 2018 via your source in the playoffs Draymond had a defensive rating of 100.8 Rudy gobert was 106.1.  In 2019 gobert was 114 draymond was 109 and Kawhi was 106.  In  2020 kawhi was 110 and gobert was 119.  In 2017 wich you left out for some strange reason( because it hurts your arguement) draymond had a higher rating in the regular season and in the playoffs he was again far far better as was Kawhi.  In 2016 Kawhi and Draymond both had better regular seasons than him. https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=MIN*G*30  In 2015 same again. https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2014-15&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=MIN*G*30     So essentially Kawhi and draymonds prime in 2015-2017 and ignored the playoffs. A lie by emission essentially. Rudy gobert is not near the level Kawhi or Draymond in the playoffs.
Basically Rudy Gobert with a 50 inch vertical?
TFW you either have to admit that Conley is really good or that the one guy who he matches minutes with - Rudy Gobert - is really good...😰
"Rudy Gobert is overpaid, but he's actually proven himself to be a great player. And is one of the league's best defenders and is a big reason why the Jazz continue to make the playoffs, and currently (very early) have the league's best record."
Really what’s your lack of optimism? Especially interested come from a fan of a franchise that gave rudy gobert 205 mill
"I never even said Joe Ingles was a primary facilitator, I said he can initiate the offense and can make plays for others, which he can. But if you think Donovan Mitchell is your best passer, you are seriously underrating what Mike Conley is actually doing for your team.  Again, nothing you said counter my argument about how Gobert brings something far more irreplaceable than Mitchell. I'm not saying Mitchell isn't a great player, but Utah is simply a talented team with guards and wings, and Rudy Gobert is a completely game changing defensive player and maybe one of these best pick and roll finishers in the league. Meanwhile, you have few other very good PnR ball handlers outside of Mitchell.  BTW: Ingles has averaged 5.2 assists over the last 4 years on less turnovers than Mitchell who has averaged 4.1 assists. For someone who's had the ball in his hands so much, he's not some type of elite passer for your team. Just look in the thread and see what most of your fellow Jazz fans are even saying."
"every year jazz fans say this because of advanced stats. Yet 30/30 GMs in an NBA re-draft would place Donovan higher than mitchell. Every year Gobert gets figured out in the playoffs, and every year we rely on mitchell offensively. Mitchell is averaging 24/5/5. That's ridiculous and rare in today's nba. Rudy is incredible as well, but nah"
"So that would be Rudy Gobert in this instance.  Realistically though, this Jazz team is built more like the Hawks team that had 4 All Stars awhile back, 3-4 guys who can drop 20+ a night but not any guy who is The Guy."
So that would be Rudy Gobert in this instance
"&gt;Rudy Gobert has unquestionably been one of the 10 most impactful players in basketball for several years now.  He's a great player but this could very easily be questioned, what do you mean unquestionably? The guys who are unquestionably top 10 most impactful are guys like LeBron, Kawhi, Giannis. Offense is more important than defense, so even if he is at that level defensively that doesn't automatically make him top 10 in terms of impact. And definitely not at a level where it can't be questioned.  He made third team All-NBA last year, if he was unquestionably top 10 in terms of impact wouldn't he be a 1st or at least 2nd team player?"
"He's not a Top 10 player by usual definitions, but Rudy Gobert has unquestionably been one of the 10 most impactful players in basketball for several years now.   In the same way that Curry or Harden is a one-man offense, Gobert is a one-man defense."
Rudy Gobert is slowly turning into the best defensive player of this generation.  He's a legit one man defense.  The last time we saw this was Dwight Howard.  If he was D12s level of skilled on offense we'd be calling him a top 10 player easy.
[Need to get the face when Gobert blocked him in the playoffs lol he looked like a turtle](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/rudy-gobert-of-the-utah-jazz-blocks-the-shot-attempt-by-nikola-jokic-picture-id1228112486?s=2048x2048)
"you do know that rudy gobert exists, right?"
"Yeah, and if you make Rudy Gobert guard point guards, he will get cooked.   But that's not the point, is it? There is absolutely no role in which Trae can be anything but an awful defender. There *is* a role in which Korver can be an adequate defender."
Body wise no that’s a bad comp lol. He’s a 7-3 gobert with the offensive skillset of jokic and way more athletic than Rudy
If Joakim Noah is a fringe all star then so is Rudy Gobert.
My favorite part of the ASG was Rudy Gobert constantly setting screens that nobody used.
Rudy gobert after filming supersize me
Built like rudy gobert...
Someone should tell Rudy Gobert it's ok to have fun in the All Star game and that he should do a crazy dunk or shoot a 3.
The last few minutes of the 2nd quarter were the most entertaining with CP3/Steph/Dame all making alley oops and Steph/Dame shooting from the half court.  Least entertaining is every Rudy Gobert dunk. Someone should tell him to have fun with his dunks or at least attempt some crazy 3 point shots.
Rudy Gobert started covid
I wanna see Rudy Gobert run point for a possession
LOL team durant should have drafted rudy gobert!
Giannis spacing the floor for Rudy Gobert and Nikola Jokic
ngl forgot rudy gobert was playing
Wait is this a Rudy Gobert Giannis and Jokic lineup
I want a bucket so I'm drafting Rudy Gobert
When they're making fun of Rudy gobert
"To show team Durant and his charity some mercy, the entire 3rd quarter should be Rudy Gobert jacking up 3 pointers."
Rudy Gobert: “I got selected because I’m great at defense” Everybody else: “LOL”
"MARV'S ANNOUNCING??? FUCKKKKKKKKK WE BOUT TO HEAR ""RUDY GOBERT WITH HIS 5TH 3 POINTER!!!"""
Rudy gobert looks like a Rick and Morty character
"This thread is wild. He made a joke. Rudy Gobert stinks, and Donavan happened to be last. Getting mad over a joke about Utah of all places is insane."
Next year we should do an anti 3pt contest gimme Ben Simmons Giannis Rudy gobert Andre Drummond and Dwight Howard
"Don't blame him, he watches Rudy Gobert every game. You can see why he thinks moving screens aren't illegal in the NBA."
Rudy gobert will be dpoy again.  He’s the reason why Utah is so strong this season!
"Embiid was 8 for 18 for 22 points when guarded by Gobert last night  It's not like Rudy matched his minutes 1:1, Favors played some long stretches against Embiid and Gobert against Howard"
"The Jazz have been boat raced out of the playoffs by teams with players nowhere near as good defensively as Rudy. So, what are you on about? talking about players like Gobert anchor anything. Superstars and players that can put the ball in the bucket without being awful defensively are what win titles."
"It's not made up. Sure, those series were lost more on the offensive end than the defensive end for the Jazz against largely more talented teams. But the Jazz have been anything but dominant defensively in the playoffs and are paying a lynchpin 30mil to have less impact in the playoffs.   Rudy can't switch or get out on the floor easily and he's not the best isolation defender, so a lot of these talented teams can mitigate his effect. Rockets and Nuggets both exploited Gobert without attacking the most glaring weakness in the Jazz scheme, which is strong wings like Kawhi, PG, Lebron."
"I’ve only noticed that quite a few counter arguments on Rudy as DPOY tend to highlight a small selection (n= 4 to 6) of games/scenarios where Gobert slipped  up during mismatches with guards and then is seemingly exposed. Fair assessment.   Apologies in advance if I’m “mansplaining” here, but just as a reminder, when sample size is increased, those instances of exposure are averaged out. When results are tallied, data has shown (past and present seasons) a statistically significant difference in defensive metric percentile scores for Gobert vs wing defenders.   I really don’t know how much the eye test goes into the voting, but from data driven/statistical perspective, Gobert definitely has the advantage here.   There was a paper presented at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference on advanced defensive metrics that came out a few years ago that might help with leveling out the statistical playing field. Here it is if you’re interested in reading about it.   http://www.lukebornn.com/papers/franks_ssac_2015.pdf"
"As a Jazz fan I'm sure you understand Rudy's impact WAY better than I do. But from the perspective of a coupe scenarios like this and the series with GSW (maybe this was regular season) stand out as hunting for guard on Gobert matchups.  The criteria for the award has certainly changed, not saying Rudy is undeserving in the slightest just that I wish some wing defenders would get looks. Marcus Smart, Ben Simmons, those guys."
"I have no clue where to even access this.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28763166/russell-westbrook-scores-34-points-being-guarded-rudy-gobert%3fplatform=amp  Here's a good example in a n=2 scenario. The defensive player of the year TO ME, should be able to play good defense on most people. A la, Kawhi. A la, prime draymond, a la, prime Dennis Rodman.  The rockets were essentially hunting for the Gobert matchup with their perimeter players."
"You have to consider that a large chunk of Mitchell’s minutes are with bench units and without Gobert. Favors is a great backup but it’s still a steep drop from Rudy. Couple that with the defensive drop off from Conley (whose minutes are essentially tied to Gobert’s) to Clarkson (who I love and is really putting effort on that end), and you see why the defense gets worse in a large portion of Mitchell’s PT.   Mitchell will also often be out there with Niang instead of O’Neale, so there’s a big difference in defensive ability of the lineup."
"Joel Embiid matchup data against Rudy Gobert last night:   8-18 FG, 1-4 3P, 5-7 FT, 22 points, 1 assist"
"If he were scared of Gobert, I couldn’t blame him. I wouldn’t want to get that close to Typhoid Rudy either.  Anyway, Embiid made him look like a scrub."
"From my view on it, it felt like the refs were inconsistent about how soft they were calling the game. As a jazz fan, there was one foul on Embiib where he jumped straight up in the air, didn't put any contact on Gobert and still got called. Rudy didn't even sell it, the refs were just calling it way too soft. Then there were other moments when they were just ripping each other apart and getting no calls. I'm all for a game being scrappy and it going that way, but give some God damned consistency to the game. It felt like there was no way to gauge what would or wouldn't be a foul because both teams could do the exact same thing as the other and get the completely opposite call. I don't think the game was rigged, but I do think the Jazz fell on the wrong side of the officiating inconsistency this game. And we've definitely fell on the good side of bad officiating as well, which just feels like a hollow victory."
"Lol no, I know Rudy gives up points, because unlike   you, I do research to justify my opinions, rather than embracing whatever makes your pp feel good.  I love that you aren’t even arguing against the idea you’re moving the goalposts, because the second you do that you concede that, like everyone is saying, centers have more responsibilities than simply guarding the other team’s center’s shots, you’d have to look to overall Jazz team defensive data to understand how good a defender Gobert is, and you know damned well Jazz lineups with Gobert are consistently among the best in the league.  Wanna guess how many of Embiid’s points were scored while Rudy was matched up on him? Go ahead, take a guess."
"[Nephew, please.](https://www.thespax.com/nba/the-multi-season-defensive-dominance-of-rudy-gobert)"
"The best player on the #1 team in the league right now is Rudy Gobert, a center.  The Heat made the Finals last year thanks largely to their All-Star center dominating in the ECF.  AD is effectively a center (he played it almost exclusively in the playoffs) and his play won the Lakers a championship last season.   Centers are nothing like running backs, they can make or break a team."
"Yeah, some of these comments read like ""If he can't guard 3 match ups in the entire NBA, he should be cut from the team."" Like who else can the Jazz get that can guard Embiid, Jokic, *and* AD? The only centers that have put up good defense against Embiid are Horford (albatross contract), Gasol (not doing too well this year), and Baynes (not doing anything well outside of guarding Embiid). The only center I can think of that did especially well against the Joker is Dwight Howard in the playoffs last year, and that's because he was able to give up free fouls to frustrate him. The only way to neutralize all three of those star big men would be to sign them. Rudy Gobert is *very* good at defense, it's frustrating how he's criticized in this thread."
"Joel Embiid matchup data against Rudy Gobert last night:   8-18 FG, 1-4 3P, 5-7 FT, 22 points, 1 assist  Obviously Joel had an amazing game and bested Gobert, but I think it’s getting a little overblown. Gobert is still an amazing defender."
If you want to be a candidate for DPOY off-ball is the answer.   Just ask Rudy Gobert
"First of all, back in '04-'05, Rashard and his wife used to shop at the grocery store I worked at in high school (Fairwood area of Kent). They are such amazingly nice people.  Anyway, I really think what you have with Gobert is what happens when any athletic 7 footer has the opportunity to prowl for defensive opportunities. If you put Jarrett Allen in his spot, or even Anthony Davis, would you get similar defensive results? (subpar 1 on 1 matchups against elite offensive bigs, and a brick wall against everyone under 7 feet). I think Rudy is a stat-grabber on defense. The defensive version of a guy who puts up 40 shots a game, instead of playing within an offense."
"@andyblarsen: Joel Embiid matchup data against Rudy Gobert last night:   8-18 FG, 1-4 3P, 5-7 FT, 22 points, 1 assist"
"@andyblarsen: Joel Embiid matchup data against Rudy Gobert last night:   8-18 FG, 1-4 3P, 5-7 FT, 22 points, 1 assist"
"I mean that's kind of the point though right? It's not a team full of polished ready to roll talen it's not a team that's got a Chris Paul or a Rudy gobert or a kawhi Leonard or an Anthony Davis sitting in the wings. It's not a team that can afford for him to have an off week or so because as you stated they don't currently have the firepower to blow guys out. It's a team that lives and dies by demar right now. I don't know if you've had a chance to watch them much this year. They're full of young up and coming players but The difference in offensive cohesion when he's on versus off is absolutely dramatic. He has become one of the most measured floor generals in the entire NBA. off the top of my head I can think of at least six of those 18 wins that demar single-handedly 100%, won for them. So just saying that those players are better than him I think is to do a disservice to how radically he has morphed his game the last couple of years. And again this is coming from someone that was one of his most vocal critics during those raptor runs. I used to throw a huge huge fit every time he would be named an All Star. The guy is damn good right now."
It's kind of crazy that Rudy Gobert was essentially the reason America shut down when it did.
“If this was about Rudy” ????  This post is literally about Embiid and Jokic averages against Gobert in two games dude...
It’s crazy that the jazz win so many games when Rudy Gobert our highest paid player literally does nothing
"Important to not misconstrue my statement. I said “All time great offense”. Jokic and Embiid are playing insane basketball right now. Unfortunately 95 percent of the players aren’t on Jokic and Embiid’s level on the pivot. Consistent defense is very much valuable. And embiid and jokic aren’t “real all stars” they are much more than that lol. They are top 10 players. MVP level, franchise players. Rudy is a hall of fame type of player but certainly not a top 10 player. Doesn’t mean he isn’t elite. There are a lot of all stars this year that aren’t as valuable as Gobert/won’t be picked by GMs over gobert."
Rudy Gobert would get abused when they go small and play Jeff Green at the 5. Brooklyn is a bad matchup for Utah in my opinion.
so Rudy Gobert?
Wow. If you *only look at Gobert* it's clear Rudy was handing out fouls like turkeys on Thanksgiving.
"This. I don't know why people insist on shitting on Gobert rather than simply giving Embiid his due praise for a great game? I'm curious to see the stats from second spectrum tomorrow from Embiid when Rudy was his primary defender. Regardless, Embiid played like an MVP, that should say more about him than it does Gobert, but people insist on shitting on Gobert for some reason."
"What else do you want a 6'2"" guard to do in the paint, become Rudy Gobert? If you want to argue that it was a blocking foul (even though calls like that rarely get overturned), then sure, but taking a charge is just smart basketball"
Nah because they want Turner for DPOY. Even though Embiid dominates Turner and Rudy actually does a pretty decent job against him. But the Jazz just lost a game so it must mean that Gobert is an overrated bum
"If Rudy Gobert is facing Embiid in the playoffs, then the Jazz had a successful season."
remember when rudy gobert coughed on all the interview mics when he had covid and then laughed about it
"So he’s literally Rudy Gobert...if you made him a worse scorer, defender, etc, etc."
"Damn lmao rudy gobert getting eaten alive the last two matchups by simmons and embiid. Simmons said he found it disrespectful for rudy to guard him when he dropped 40 and now embiid says this,"
Embiid plays a completely different type of game compared to Jokic and Rudy.  Of course they don't get the calls he does.  Gobert shouldn't even be talking.  He has the ball in his hands like a minute a game and only takes wide open layups/dunks.
Rudy “I’m allowed to goaltend” Gobert crying again
 &gt; I’d be willing to bet that most of those points came while Rudy was on the bench...   At least today..that wasn't the case.  Embiid had 11 points in the 12isn minutes he shared with Favors on the floor and 29 points in the 28 minutes he shared with Gobert on the floor.  Not to mention Dwight scoring 12 points in 12 minutes off the bench all primarily against Gobert
"&gt;Gobert has defended an opposing player on 8024 total possessions since the 2017-18 season. It’s not the most in the league (as the graph clearly shows) because guards defend ball-handlers more often than big men. In fact, Gobert is 36th in most plays matched up against an offensive player since 2018. Nonetheless, he has saved 762.5 total points, the most in the league during this span. Forget volume, though. Nobody comes close to Gobert’s efficiency either. The ‘Gobert Line’ represents his DPS: total points saved per 100 possessions. Since 2018, Gobert has saved 9.50 points per 100 possessions — also the most in the league in this span.   &gt;   &gt;Can’t find Gobert’s points? Just ignore the bottom 98.9% of points. and it might become easier. The lowest D-PIPM Gobert has ever put up was 3.24 in his rookie season when he was averaging just below ten minutes per game. That’s the 55th highest D-PIPM recorded since 2010 out of 4853 total single-season performances. In other word, Rudy Gobert’s least valuable single-season defensive performance was still more valuable than than nearly 99% of all single-season defensive performances since 2010. That’s not too shabby. The last time he wasn’t in the top-2 was in 2016.  I reccommend checking out the accompanying graphs too which show just how ridiculous Gobert's defensive impact is [https://www.thespax.com/nba/the-multi-season-defensive-dominance-of-rudy-gobert/](https://www.thespax.com/nba/the-multi-season-defensive-dominance-of-rudy-gobert/)  but hey good reddit analyis, he can't play 1 on 1 defense so lets just ignore 4 seasons worth of data that shows how Gobert single handedly had the biggest defensive impact in the league."
"Okay on one hand we have your handful of Jazz games subject experience on the other hand we have data, let me present you one article that takes a look at defensive impact from 2017 to 2020. This is a three year period we are talking about:  This article has in graphs (and I reccommend you reading it) numbers over a three year period that shows how Gobert is at the top of the league when it comes to drop off in opponent EFG, he's in the top 1% in the league when it comes to defensive points saved, and his D-PIPM numbers are historically great.   [https://www.thespax.com/nba/the-multi-season-defensive-dominance-of-rudy-gobert/](https://www.thespax.com/nba/the-multi-season-defensive-dominance-of-rudy-gobert/)  His primary value comes from rim protection, alot of Utah's defense is predicated on funelling players to the rim and he has had multiple seasons of altering shots."
"Which makes no sense because Embiid has dominated that matchup in the past. Even though it was still BS to say he ducked Gobert, Rudy at least has contained Embiid before."
"As a counterpoint, at the end of 4Q and OT:  - Gobert brings his arm and shoulder down into Embiids shot with a lot of contact and no call.   - Donovan Mitchell initiates the contact on a 3 by jumping to the side on his corner 3, which by league rule is not a foul on the defender  - Rudy Gobert at the top of the arc on a double screen  pivoted as he screened and grabbed the defenders jersey to open up a wide open (Bogdonovic i think?) 3.   I do think the O’Neale play was BS, but they did call that one by the books. That’s a rule that should probably be revisited this offseason.   Not saying we didn’t benefit from calls - absolutely we did - just saying there were some head scratching moments on both sides tonight"
"&gt; Royce O'Neale saving the ball from OOB, gets called for OOB, Sixers ball. Refs reviewed it, upheld the call because they said the ball brushed against the leg of a ref who didn't get out of the way of the play enough.  So they made the correct call by the rules.   &gt; Mitchell in the early part of OT got hooked by Simmons and tried to hit him with a spin-move into a layup to get the call (since you can't hook the arm of the guy you're defending), they called him for an offensive foul, then a T  Mitchell hooked Simmons, the replays clearly showed this.   &gt; Rudy Gobert defending Joel Embiid, Embiid puts up a shot, gets his own rebound, puts up another, gets his own rebound, then falls over and they called a push on Gobert.

He's elbowing him in the side as Embiid goes up, this is a foul every day of the week and is the reason Embiid misses the dunk.   &gt; the Mitchell ejection which was the byproduct of a sequence of really bad calls on the part of the refs.  All the above called were correct, he was frustrated because Simmons locked him up and he shot his team out of this game."

Rudy Gobert was used and abused tonight
Rudy Gobert proving Shaq right.  Embiid acting like he just won a championship (really epitomizes him) and refs being trash.
# LFG. FUCK RUDY GOBERT. DPOY MY ASS.
Rudy Gobert fuck you you animal
Rudy Gobert calling for a challenge when he already made Snyder take a failed challenge is funny lol. would've gotten this one though
HERE COMES RUDY GOBERT WITH THE MONEY IN THE BANK BRIEFCASE
can someone edit over the other guy with rudy gobert
donovan mitchell is a 6th man and rudy gobert is french cody zeller
Rudy Gobert
Nobody outside of Utah gives a single fuck about the Jazz. The Jazz could go 74-8 and they'd still be irrelevant. Non-hardcore fans don't want to watch Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley (as good as those guys are).
99% sure I saw Rudy Gobert trying and failing to get into VIP at Staples during All Star weekend 2018. Poor dude
Wow such constructive criticism such as  putting Mitchell on the spot in an interview and making degrading memes about Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert for the MVP then.
Butler is averaging 20/8/8 and I feel like that's pretty reflective of his impact lol  G: Conley  G: Mikal Bridges  F: Josh Hart  F: Draymond Green  C: Rudy Gobert
"You’re so right, this year’s MVP race should be between Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons"
"Absolutely not. Just think of a 1-5 pnr like they're talking about. Say Rudy Gobert's guarding Jokic and Mitchell's guarding Murray. If you switch that, you have Gobert guarding Murray, and Mitchell on Jokic. That's not something you ideally want out of your defense."
I mean.. who is better between Chris Paul and Rudy Gobert? How do you compare the two?
"From 2013-2018 the 27th pick has been Rudy Gobert, Bogdan Bogdanavic, Larry Nance Jr, Kuzma, Siakam, and Robert Williams. It's been a very solid run but can't speak about the last two. That's 2 stars and 3 solid role players if Rob stays healthy.  Edit bonus is the 3rd pick Run. In the last 10 years The 3rd pick would produce a team of Luka, Beal, Brown, Tatum, and Embiid."
Imagine we made titles like this for every player   “26 year old Nikola Jokic splashes a mid ranger in the eye of 28 year old Rudy Gobert”
He won’t win. Ben Simmons or Rudy Gobert will win.
"Gobert will always affect the game more statistically because all his work is done near the net. Rim protectors are always going to be involved in higher percentages of defensive plays. The ball literally has to come to him. Rudy is great at what he does, I just think Ben's right there with him when it comes to being great at what he does."
"It’s shit like this why people don’t like the modern NBA. Dudes, “big men”, like Gobert crying about someone touching them.   Also he has no problem when he’s fouling other people and getting away with it. Guys who want to take the physicality completely out of basketball are annoying and bad for the game.  You got out muscled Rudy by a very muscular guy. Hit the weight room. Don’t cry for the refs to help you."
James Harden and Rudy Gobert
I don’t have a full list but Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert are locks.
"For anyone interested in the actual breakdown or “how well that turned out”, here you go:  Ben Simmons was guarded by Rudy Gobert for 4 minutes, 26 seconds.  Gobert Defending       •  FG — 3/7 (42.9%)       •  AST/TO — 1/3 (0.33)  Not Gobert Defending       •  FG — 12/19 (63.2%)       •  AST/TO — 11/1 (11.0)"
Rudy Gobert started Covid-19
"I know a lot of people who blame Rudy Gobert for bringing the Coronavirus to the US  Obviously, they’re wrong, but they still hate him"
Because the Sixers having a worse defensive rating than the Jazz despite having Ben Simmons (apparently better on defense than Rudy Gobert) AND another top 5 defensive player would be too comically bad of a take even for nba.com
While all my homies hate Rudy Gobert plays
Rudy Gobert and Karl Anthony Towns
"Rudy Gobert is a top 2 defensive player in the league, and he ain't #2.  Also Jamal Murray fucking lol"
"if Rudy Gobert is the main person to contest the shot, the rest of the Jazz struggle to defensive rebound. It’s been a lowkey trend all year but I think teams are starting to notice this as well and willing to force Gobert to contest even if they miss that shot. Because of the offensive rebounding chances"
"Honestly I haven't noticed Clipper fans being any more defensive than other fans. But that's coming from a Jazz fan, where I feel like every thread ends up being about how Rudy Gobert doesn't deserve his salary"
by that logic Donovan Mitchell should be MVP! Rudy Gobert should be MVP! Joe Ingles is in that discussion too
"I think the distinction is   Switches which end with a guard shooting a pull J over a 7 footer=usually shitty   [possessions on totality where a guard defends a big or vice versa for that teams offensive rating](https://twitter.com/knarsu3/status/1162465103738036224?s=21)=generally good   This stat is from 2 years ago with lower offensive ratings and isn’t specific for Rudy. Idk what the overall offensive rating of teams is when they get Rudy on the perimeter. But it’s much more getting a mismatch the point of it is to compromise the defense force them to send help, lead to a breakdown etc. Even if the guy who got the switch isn’t the one who ends up scoring.   I don’t really agree with this tweet but I think the better point is on the other end Rudy can’t capitalize on teams playing small and putting smaller guys on him. If they play in the playoffs a team like LAC will put marcus Morris at the 5 a lot and get open 3 after open 3 while Gobert won’t be able to punish them on the other end"
"That's pretty much exactly why they do it I reckon. It's not that Gobert is an easy mismatch to shoot over, but Utah are so undersized outside of Rudy that if you take him out to the perimeter, and the Jazz guards don't rotate in time you can get a pretty good look at the rim while he's not patrolling the paint."
"Cade Cunningham - Trevor Lawrence: Tall/Big generation talents that every team wants  Patrick Beverly - Jalen Ramsey (ramsey a lot better but the attitude and skillset): Defensive focused players in LA that are aggressive, get a lot of fouls, talk shit and love to take on the star player of the other team, heart and soul of team  Daniel Jones RJ Barrett:Young top 10 picks out of 2019 Duke that have been really good but sometimes inconsistent. Are both doubted and underrated by media  Kyler Murray Devin Booker or Lamelo Ball: Young exciting prospects out of Arizona (Besides Ball) that will be top players in the future  Aaron Donald Rudy Gobert: Large players that impact the entire defense of their team  DK Metcalf/Zion Williamson: Large freak athletes with a really bright future in the league  Baker Mayfeild Lonzo Ball: Top picks in their respective class that haven't panned out but are still good players, Lonzo is a lot like a QB and they both have been overshadowed by better players in their draft"
Look I know I'm gonna sound like a homer but Booker *and* CP3 over Rudy Gobert is straight up stupid
"I think Adams is really one of the best role player centers in the league.  On that note, I think Rudy Gobert is maybe the best role player since Ben Wallace, that is intended as a compliment."

Donovan Mitchell? After he got all butt hurt and was throwing shade about the Rudy Gobert shit? Lol mans a fucking goof
"You know Embiid had 40 against Gobert this year, right? Jokic had 35 and 47. I don’t think Rudy wants to guard either."
"Conveniently leaving out star duo Joe Ingles and Rudy Gobert for a +18.5 net rating...  400+ minute line ups are hilarious - Niang is in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th best duo lineups"
"Rudy Gobert, for one"
DPOY is so easily Rudy its laughable. They are trying to magically give it to Simmons who is the 2nd best defender on his team and doesnt have the analytics to back him as much as Gobert.
"The rankings:   **DPOY:**  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Bam Adebayo  **MVP:**   1. Nikola Jokic 2. Damian Lillard 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Joel Embiid 5.

In the coronavirus era I would start the franchise with Rudy Gobert
 That’s the thing he is quick enough to guard on the perimeter.  The strength thing may be legit but outside of Robin Lopez he was pretty good against very other Center we played.  He knows how to defend without fouling and he can switch on the perimeter .  So maybe he’s not good enough to be the anchor of a defense but in Chicago who was the best defensive player he played next to.  Thad Young?  He isn’t Rudy Gobert but his defensive foibles are highly exaggerated because most defense in the NBA is a team scheme and he’s really really good in our team scheme.
KAT is better than Gobert. You see the Suns-Jazz game yesterday? During crunch time Rudy is nonexistent on offense. He’s not rim running during crunch time and he’s also not spacing the floor.
"Gobert. KAT is VERY CLOSE with Rudy but man his defense, impact, and winning sure is something. There is a gap (not massive but still a gap) between KAT and 5th Bam (maybe even Vucevic idk)"
Neither. It’s Rudy Gobert.
"The things you say that Gobert does are a lot harder and more valuable than you make it out to be. Help defense is the most important part of being a defensive anchor, and Rudy is leagues above everyone in the business at it."
Rudy Gobert 31 year old woman confirmed
"Well, Rudy played less than him lol so playing more games isn’t the biggest argument. It’s as simple as Gobert was absolutely amazing. Name one other player who played 56 games and earned 89/101 votes"
"Bucks look pretty good built around Giannis - Jazz look pretty good built around Rudy Gobert (who essentially has a supermax). Teams have 7 years before players are even eligible for a supermax, and by the time a player would earn a supermax the team is presumably no longer in the ""building"" stage."
"Does anyone know where he pulled these stats from?   According to NBA stats/Synergy, [Rudy Gobert has only guarded the roll man on 86 pick and roll this season](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/roll-man/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TypeGrouping=defensive&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*&amp;sort=POSS&amp;dir=1) which is the most in the NBA. [And has only guarded 12 pick and roll ball bandlers](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ball-handler/#!?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=POSS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*Gobert&amp;TypeGrouping=defensive) which isn't even 100, let alone 300. But maybe I'm doing something wrong."
"Ah yes. DPOY candidates Myles Turner, Rudy Gobert, and Nikola Jokic"
"Defense. There is an ABUNDANCE of offensive players in the league and only a handful of ELITE defenders. I think of guys that change the makeup of their team, Rudy Gobert, Ben Wallace, Scottie pippen, Dennis Rodman, Gary Payton."

Hearing fans boo Rudy Gobert while he stalled putting his contact in was hilarious. Made me realize how much we've been missing without fans.
"Oh ya, I definitely know Chris Paul’s history. Rudy Gobert lying on the floor and leaving the game momentarily after replays showed he barely got touched is 10x funnier than any of Chris Paul’s flops 😂😂  It was nearly Paul Pierce leaving the game after shitting himself level of funny"
"Rudy Gobert may be one of the best rim protectors in the league, but he is an absolute liability in the high screen pick and roll."
Rudy Gobert can go suck a dick
Rudy Gobert
"Rudy Gobert, FT god"
"Rudy ""flop"" gobert???"
I feel like Monty has to match taking out Ayton with Gobert. Once Rudy comes in against Saric the Jazz will have the upper hand.
"They’re saying mitchell and Booker should be in the mvp conversations, but neither are MVPs of their own team. Chris Paul and Rudy Gobert both are much more impactful for both squads."
Pipe down your best player is Rudy fucking Gobert
"&gt; What's the argument here? Just defense? Gobert is a minimal offensive threat that barely creates his own points. He's scoring 15ppg and happens to have the best shooting team in the league around him which helps a ridiculous amount with having free points near the basket.  Best defender in the league right now, by a wide margin.  I don't think too many people disagree with that, so that's all I'll say about that.  As far as offense, yeah he's pretty offensively limited and doesn't create his own points, but he DOES create points for the rest of the team.  He's an elite roll man which really helps our shooters get shots.  His gravity lures defenders into the paint, which leaves our shooters wide open.  People think he just stands there and waits for lobs, but he's extremely important to our offense.  Utah wouldn't be the 3 point shooting team it is without Gobert's gravity on the inside.  And of course, we can't forget that he leads the league in screen assists.  People get unreasonably mad at screen assists for some reason, though.    &gt; He's a perennial DPOY candidate, but got 40 dropped on him by Embiid, 35 then 47 dropped on him by Jokic, which I goes more to show that man-on-man the advantage goes to post scorers. Gobert is a game changer overall by anchoring the entire defense for sure, but I think top 10 requires way more than that.  I mean, if you just look at a box score, yeah, but when it was actually Gobert defending Embiid that game, Gobert did well.  According to [this article in the Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/joel-embiid-scared-76ers-rudy-gobert-20210304.html), over the last two seasons, Embiid has shot 19-for-48 (39.5%) with Gobert on the floor, and 12-for-35 (34.2%) when Gobert was the closest defender.  As for Jokic, he's just the MVP, lmao.  He's just straight up a bad matchup for Gobert, lmao.  No one else out there quite like him.  But yeah, a lot of advanced stats really like Gobert as well, such as NBA.com having him as the #1 among all starters in Net Rating, and [538's RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) having nothing but good things to say about him.    He's the best player on the best team in the league right now.  I don't think a team does as well as Utah is doing without at least one player in the top 10.  In a thread about hot takes, I figured this opinion was warranted."
Me and the real fans know Rudy Gobert is a top 10 player in the NBA.  A lot of /r/NBA just isn't ready to have that conversation though.
"I just said if all you care about is win loss record then just look at win shares. Looking at record is braindead, and you know it too. If it was we would all say rudy gobert is the best player in the league but we don't because you only like to be braindead and act like record is all that matters when it's convenient"
"It’s really fucking good against Rudy though. Zion’s also the only player to draw more than 3 shooting fouls against Gobert this year, which is equally impressive."
Rudy Gobert
"Rudy Gobert was at one point the worst player in the league, averaging 2.3 pts on 50% ts."
"I will say Jokic neutralizes a lot of what Rudy Gobert does. He is able to stretch the floor and take Rudy away from the rim on defense where he plays best. I think it’s a close matchup but if I were the Jazz I would be scared to play the nuggets. Jokic is going to put up his usual MVP numbers and Rudy has never really slowed him down. MPJ is one of the best shooters in the league and can pull up against anyone. Jamal Murray elevates his game, plays better under pressure, and has proved this season to be clutch. Then you throw in Aaron Gordon, who is proving to be elite at cutting to the rim and get easy looks with his athleticism.   I think the nuggets win the series 5-6 games. Jokic neutralizes Rudy which is the reason the Jazz have such a dominant defense. Then you have 3 players that can hit off balance and difficult shots at a high percentage. And on top of this Jokic and Jamal Murray have arguably the best two man game in the entire NBA. The playoffs is a much slower, more physical, and half court game and the nuggets two best players both excel in this environment."
&gt; Crazy how people don’t see a 2 time DPOY who could very well become 3 time after this season as a super star.  Rudy Gobert pretty clearly isn't a superstar.  There's nothing crazy about that.
Imagine if Rudy Gobert shot the 3 like Kelly Olynyk
How highly do you have Rudy Gobert ranked? Top 10? 15?
"Danny Green, Shane Battier, Robert Covington. 3&amp;D are still underrated.   Also: Rudy Gobert"

Rudy Gobert shoe deal incoming
"https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/rudy-gobert-og-anunoby-jazz-ejection/19iqsjjz0ocqu1xyjl8mnogvlz  He's probably nice irl but he's dirty in game,"
https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/rudy-gobert-og-anunoby-jazz-ejection/19iqsjjz0ocqu1xyjl8mnogvlz
"Rudy Gobert has posted on social media multiple times about Uyghur genocide, Morey specifically caused so much controversy because the Rockets were effectively Chinas team"
"Right, but Gobert was a true project. Late first rounder, without a lot of expectations regarding his development. Wiseman was the #2 pick and plays like he should have been a mid to late 1st rounder. Sure we knew he needs time to develop, but he looks extremely raw even for a supposed project. I'm not sure if he has Gobert's feel for the game either. Rudy looked pretty good from his sophomore season on, and I'm not sure if Wiseman will even be serviceable by next year. Again, I am very interested in his development."
If Rudy Gobert gets the 3 ball going its a wrap! League fucked! Game over!!!
"yeah i actually think rudy simmons (or ben gobert) would be a super dangerous player. rudy has no handles and frankly no finishing ability. give him the ability to dribble, and to playmake, and to actually do more than just dunk, and wow that's the mvp right there  &amp;#x200B;  not to mention you're giving rudy fucking gobert the ability to guard iso players the way ben simmons does"
I think the hate comes from the fact that you can’t play Rudy Gobert deeper into the playoffs because he struggles to defend in space. He was a legit liability vs Houston.   Not fitting of a DPOY.   Id say a better example of bias against defensive minded players is the Draymond Green slander
"I'd say a playmaking version of Rudy Gobert would be really scary, even if he can't shoot from 5 feet away from the rim"
"If PG’s defense was as good as Giannis’s sure. And if Steph or Harden were as bad as Jokic in the most integral defensive positions, sure.  If by “larger” you mean 10x more then you’re just wrong. If you gave me Paul George with Rudy Gobert or Giannis type defensive impact, he’s one of the greatest players ever"
^(rudy gobert)
He's in the same boat as Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. They deserve fringe votes for being on a top team and having career years. But they aren't in the top-5 conversation or in contention for actually winning the award.
"You're right. Donovan and Royce are so off tonight.   Also, this is not a stray on Rudy. This just meant Gobert will be put on him cause he's the least threat on offense, so Gobert will always be ready to help on the paint. I think most of DFS 3PA this game are all open 3s coming from a drive-kickout. This sub just love to hate Rudy."
"Wait did KAT die or something wtf.  Jokic=Embiid&gt;KAT&gt;Gobert&gt;Bam  Jokic and Embiid are head and shoulders above the rest imo, with KAT and his talent and what he has showed us he can do putting him at 3 (minny being trash isnt really all his fault). Then gobert who rose real quick this season and is there purely for his ridiculous defensive presence and a glue guy for the 1 seed jazz. Lastly Bam who is just such a talented player and is so good both offensively and defensively and has proven he can show up big when needed to.  Those are my top 5.  Next tier below are just below Bam and have potential to get in the top 5. These are Vuc, KP, Christian Wood and Timelord.   Vuc on a good team i believe can really shine, the magic just was not it for him to really display his true talents. KP when healthy is something that is completely unstoppable offensively tbh. Hes on the low end of this list but every season he has flashes and games that really show just how dangerous he can be but his health stops him from going any higher. Christian Wood has made leaps and bounds this season and now that he has minutes is showing how talented he is. I think he has the skills to be a top tier center but needs a little more time for growth.  While the top 5 are what i consider completely irreplaceable players for their teams and whose skillset are damn near complete (other than rudy but his defensive prowess compensates for him not being as good as the others on offence), the next tier is the players who i think can make then jump up but need a little more development or experience or that have the potential to be great but dont show it properly due to their circumstances. This is exactly where i think timelord fjts in. Hes not yet a superstar caliber player and is still definitely growing. He is doing well and shows potential but has not proven that he can show up big when needed. You cant really justify a player being top 5 center imo without them being a clear top 2 option and be getting some serious minutes.  Maybe he will take that next jump next year, but for now na no way hes already a top 5 center currently."
"I mean it's clear that it's a coach decision by the Jazz. Rudy stays in the paint and they leave their worst shooter open. Dorian's a roughly 37% 3pt shooter but he basically only shoots wide open shots. Rick said he'll take that. Now Dorian went 5/12, and you'd expect him to hit 4 or 5 of those shots. What was more unexpected was that Dorian created a little off the dribble. That was nice.   This is how teams will guard the Mavs in the playoffs - sag off of whatever non-shooter is on the court and put a wing on KP so your shot blocker can deter Luka from owning the paint and stay out of rotation. This mostly worked all night - Luka's points mostly came off 3s and the Mavs had a hot shooting night but still only put up 111. Gobert really limted Luka in the paint.   I came away from the game feeling like the Mavs got a little lucky, even if they played well."
"Rudy Gobert. All star caliber player, not starting on the 76ers."
"I mean, you have entire teams afraid to attack the paint when they play Gobert.   Just because perimeter players give props to the guys guarding them directly doesn't mean people don't remember real quick when Gobert is on the court to be a lot more careful attacking the hoop. I've seen so many drives aborted without even trying to probe because Rudy is in position."
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."

Rudy Gobert
"Context my friend. Rudy's playoff series losses include: 2017 Golden State, who were literally unstoppable and Rudy just came back from a knee injury; 2018 Rockets, in which Quinn Snyder's defensive scheme was very dumb; 2019 Rockets, where Gobert did a great job and it was their shooting that was abysmal; and the 2020 Nuggets, where again Rudy did way better than most people do against Jokic but he just could not miss that series. That doesn't even include how good he was during the OKC series in 2018.  Playoff metrics think Rudy is fine and those are already effected by pretty unfavourable matchups."
r/nba has Rudy Gobert as its god? Seriously? Dude gets slandered daily lmfaoo
Rudy Gobert?
Huh? Rudy Gobert is a paint defender who affects team offenses. Jrue is a iso defender who guards teams ball handlers.
"A lot of people here are shitting on Wilt hard.  It's really hard to find accurate stats on Wilt since he lied all the time, people took it at face value, and the NBA didn't keep any real stats.  He didn't bench 600lbs because that's a ridiculous statement and he didn't have a 50"" vertical unless he never jumped his max height in a game, in college high jump, or on camera (trust me I dove deep and people have tried very hard to prove it, always coming out with 38-41"" for his vertical).  The numbers we are confident on compared to Shaq for reference are:  standing reach: 9'6"" for Wilt / 9'5"" for Shaq  height with no shoes: 7'1"" for Wilt / 7' for Shaq  wingspan: 7'8"" for Wilt / 7'7"" for Shaq  Weight: 280-310 for prime Wilt / 315-335 for prime Shaq  Max reach: 12'6""-12'8"" for Wilt (13' is rumored but unlikely) / 12'5"" for Shaq   40 yard dash: 4.6 for Wilt / 5.8 for Shaq in 2007, so maybe 5-5.3 in his prime?  Many of the stats are very close but the ones that stand out are Shaq being slower than Wilt, and weighing more (so he's probably a lot stronger).  Things that aren't clear are anything on court since the game is completely different.  Bball IQ in the modern game, lateral quickness, skill in the post, etc.  All we have for that are the assumption that he's coordinated with videos of his game, and highlights of his skills such as a turnaround jumper, an elite hookshot, and a finger roll (which he developed due to the ruleset at the time).  I think in the 90's game, Wilt would still be elite.  He'd likely be the fastest center in the NBA by a good margin and also on the taller end with the highest reach and vertical.  280-310 is nothing small either, only the biggest guys would bully him.  I think in the 10's-20's NBA Wilt's value would be at an all time low and he would devolve into a defensive specialist / screen setter / lob catcher due to likely being a bad shooter as evidence by his 51% FT.  That being said I think he could easily play the role of a Rudy Gobert, but with a reliable post game.  Probably not an MVP but an all-star at least.  All the way through the eras of modern bigman dominance (70's, 80's, 90's) I think Wilt would have a place near the top with his speed, touch, and vertical."
"It feels about right.    Like the shot BI got fouled on last season that Rudy “blocked”. It was obvious to everyone it was a foul, and if anyone else was there they probably whistle. But Gobert is a DPOY level player. Enough where refs doubt the call or assume that they’re defended it cleanly more often because of their rep."
"finney-smith going off wasn't no fluke  usually his rotations mirror the best offensive player (was the primary on mitchell tonight), but with rudy covering him on offense, carlisle was rotating him so that he'd be on the floor whenever rudy was (through 3q), then there was a 2nd adjustment to do more drives and kick outs  i can only guess why finney-smith was on the floor to begin the 4th when he went nuclear, he's almost never on then as teams' best players rarely start the 4th and neither mitchell or gobert were on, but since it's so anomalous it must have been a deliberate decision based on something"
"Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert, and some guys they found on the street outside the arena, I think"
Rudy Gobert with a positive +/- in an 8 point deficit
"Actual title: Luka tries to take Gobert off the dribble and Rudy fouls Luka the entire drive, getting away with bad play."
"Looking forward to the articles, podcasts, and r/NBA new fodder of ""Is Rudy Gobert really the MVP this year?"" quoting this stat, whatever their preferred defensive stat is (""His LEBRONS-D is enormous!""), and screen assists.  I like Gobert and think he's great and all, just making a prediction."
"so you cant make judgements on players until their careers are over or until they win a title?  its not this year that rudy has been the best defender, its the last 5 years  i guess since the jazz didnt have a good enough team to win a championship, that means gobert hasnt actually been the best defender  or somethign, whatever ur trying to say"
That Rudy Gobert was a better center than Joel Embiid.  On offense.
"Rudy Gobert played 9 minutes a game his first year. But I agree, Embiid, AD, KAT, we’re all hyped, and people figured out pretty quickly that Jokic was good"
yea  I know I am just trying to understand the orginal comment where he saying pretty much every perennial all star C came in Good Day 1 so I am trying to understand the bench mark for good. Rudy Gobert is showing to be a perennial all star and I wouldn't consider him Good Day 1.
"Jokic, DeAndre Jordan, Demarcus Cousins, Marc Gasol, Rudy Gobert, Joakim Noah, Al Jefferson. All had mediocre to downright terrible rookie seasons. And that is just to name a few.      It's like you people just talk out of your ass."

"The Jazz realized very early that gobert does take thoughtful roster construction to build around, but in terms of pure impact fulfills so many roles for which it takes multiple players for most teams to accomplish. It makes him elite impact-wise (even if he’s not necessarily elite when it comes to raw skill)  In football terms rudy is the entire defensive line, both safeties AND the entire offensive line, all wrapped into one fifth of the on court presence.   You get four other players to fill out cornerbacks (perimeter defense), then just load the team with shooters for your skill positions like wide receiver.  In terms of making the roles of other players easier I’m not sure there’s another player in the league that plays better support on offense and defense, which is his most overlooked attribute  It was a slow transformation but we were a good not great team when we had no shooters outside Donovan plus rudy, and made our final transformation when we got Conley and bogey, and finally a backup c that lets gobert play defense more aggressively without worrying about  fouling."
"Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid"
Defensively or as an overall player.  I think Gobert is a better overall player and has more versatility as a defender but Mutombo is probably still a slightly better defender because his rim protection was just a bit more impactful than Rudy and his post defense is also better.  Rudy can switch and move more but also rebounding goes to Dikembe.  Rudys offense as a pick and roll man and overall screener in general puts him over the top for me.
"Rudy Gobert. Mutombo won’t be able to lockdown anyone in the modern era due to players being stronger, faster, bigger and smarter than in the 90s."
"Advanced stats guys have had Gobert as a top-10 player for at least the past 3 years. And yeah, I'm a Jazz fan, but I am also a realist, an NBA fan, &amp; (very) amateur student of the game, and I don't disagree.   Rudy will never get the respect he deserves by fans in general, bcz his offensive greatness doesn't show up on a stat sheet &amp; even his defensive impact is underappreciated, and that's fine. It's something you don't recognize if you don't regularly watch Utah play &amp; closely pay attention to Gobert specifically--as most of his elite work is done off-ball  But there just isn't a player in the league that's more positively impactful to his team winning that Gobert is, and I will die on this hill.   Yeah, he's the DPOY. Everyone knows that. But Utah's record setting 3 pt shooting, borderline perfect offensive shot chart, &amp; league leading offensive production and efficiency are all because of Rudy Gobert."
"Yeah, but his point is still valid. Gobert has tons of game-saving/winning blocks &amp; defensive plays over the past 3-4 seasons in clutch situations.   Yeah, Rudy is a ""floor raiser"", but raises the ceiling too w/ winning late game play against the best teams.  But yeah. Utah isn't a contender w/out Mitchell leading Utah's offense."
"I think that was definitely part of it.   Point is teams with scoring bigs w/range caused problems for Utah defensively. Not because Gobert can't defend them, but bcz it forces Gobert to focus of a single defender-- rather than being able to roam the paint &amp; keep everyone else from getting buckets at the rim.   That is why they needed a 2nd quality defensive big to be able to A) back-up Rudy effectively &amp; B) play mins next to him to defend quality opposing 5's when necessary (like Jokic &amp; AD)  But reports were that it was primarily Utah's problems w/Davis &amp; the Lakers last year, that led to Utah targeting Favors.  [Source](https://lakersdaily.com/report-utah-jazz-decided-to-target-derrick-favors-after-having-problems-with-anthony-davis/)"
"Just imagine Rudy Gobert as main ball handler, playmaker, and offensive intiator?"
devin booker received the 26th most all star votes from fans. He received more votes than:   * Chris Paul   * Rudy Gobert   * Ben Simmons  * Kyle Lowry   * Nikola Vucevic   * CJ McCollum   * SGA  I'd say he is properly rated
"Whilst I agree with your sentiment, the Utah Jazz are an interesting case and I’ll tell you why.   I believe Rudy Gobert is a top 15-20 player, and he anchors the 3rd best defensive in the league right now, and I think he’s the best defensive player in the league right now, but there’s more to it to Utah having the best record in the league.   On top of having a top 3 defense, they also have a top 2 offense, and it’s ever so slightly to Brooklyn who are #1.  They have 10 guys that are posting .565 TS% or more,  and 5 above .600 TS%. This is a very, very, effective and efficient offense.  They also shoot the most 3’s in the league, so I think although Rudy is responsible for their defense and therefore a big part of their success, he absolutely isn’t at the forefront of it all.   If Utah were to have an average offense, and Rudy was still anchoring them to a top 3 defense, this post wouldn’t exist right now."
The Jazz literally built their team around Gobert tho and he's the reason why they're a perennial 50 win playoff team with a top 5 defence in the West.      [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR9uwZItEjY) also shows how he plays a vital role in our making our 3 point heavy offensive game plan work with his roll gravity and clever reading and passing. I agree that he's not an actual MVP guy but you can build a team around Rudy.
"&gt; Again, Randle’s rebounds per game are inflated because he plays 40+ minutes a game.   This is part of what value is and what goes into single season awards playing alot. It's not a debate of the best players just who had the best seasons and how much you play for that matters just like games missed.   1st:   G: Doncic  G: Steph F: Giannis  F: Kawhi C: Jokic  2nd   G: Lillard  G: Harden  F: LeBron F: Jimmy Butler C: Embiid   3rd:  G: Chris Paul G: Kyrie Irving  F: Jayson Tatum F: Paul George  C: Rudy Gobert   Neither of us have Zion or Randle interestingly. Im not as high on Trae Young as you(doesnt pressure the rim and isnt a real off ball threat which keeps him from being the highest offensive tier for me) and probably thinks his defense is more harmful than you do but this is otherwise pretty close. I also probably dont put as much emphasis on efficiency as you which is probably where the Tatum disagreement would stem from. Both Randle and Zion were real close for me, I just think Tatum is a little better."
"Nah, if you polled NBA GMs right now 90% of them would take Rudy over KAT if you ignore age/contract status and just look at them as players. It’s way easier to build a winner around Rudy than Towns. When you have a center as bad defensively as Towns, it severely handicaps your GM because you have to target a very limited pool of power forwards that can also provide rim protection. The biggest reason the a wolves haven’t been able to build around Towns is because finding a power forward that can do that is extremely difficult.   With Rudy you can basically ignore the defense of your other players and solely focus on building the best offensive cast you can. Gobert lets you sign a guy like Bojan to play power forward and start nobody else above 6’ 4”. There’s also not close to being inverses of each other. Towns is a horrific defender while Gobert is the most efficient offensive player of all time. Rudy might not be a star offensively but he’s among the very best offensive role players in the league.   Taking Towns over Gobert is just ignoring the fact the basketball is a 5 on 5 game. On a playground pickup game that’s 1v1 towns is obviously more skilled, but it’s beyond clear at this point Rudy contributes more to winning at an NBA level, and every objective metric out there supports that."
Rudy Gobert
"Hallmark of an elite level player is the ability to make his teammates better. Gobert is a legitimate quarterback on defense. Sets the tone, helps, etc etc. KAT is an ultra talent and will always get his, but he is a meh defender and while he stuffs the stat sheet, does he elevate his guys enough to be better than Rudy?"
One could make the inverse argument for KAT and Rudy Gobert
Ok I’m gonna say it again Rudy Gobert is not a good offensive player.
"I dont think anybody is really arguing Thybulle is at a DPOY level.   However, Thybulle this year:  RAPTOR: [4th in defense in the NBA](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)  EPM: [2nd in the NBA](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm)  LEBRON: 12th in the [NBA in DLEBRON](https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/)  The reason he isnt having a DPOY caliber season beyond the min argument is because Rudy Gobert is in the NBA and is a historic level defender. If it werent for him and Thbyulle were playing 30-35 min a game he'd have a viable case. Probably still wouldnt win DPOY but he would be in the general convo."
Why are rudy gobert fans so insecure lmao. y’all get your feelings hurt on his behalf
"One random person on Twitter doesn't like Rudy Gobert &gt;&gt; ""OMG, why does so many fans hate Rudy Gobert?!""."
"I think my issue with this is that in the past few playoffs, it's not like the Jazz have been favorites in their matchups. People say he got played off the floor last year but he led the Jazz in minutes played and had a pretty good net rating.  The year before he wasn't great and the Rockets turned up the pressure on him. So yeah, that wasn't a great series. But no one brings up that Mitchell was abysmal in that series. It gets pinned on Rudy while Donovan was a negative in every advanced stat and had a 42% TS.   Same thing happened the year prior against the Rockets.  So like is Gobert ideal against an elite PnR player like Harden? Nope. But the #1 thing dragging them down was Donovan Mitchell taking 2x more shots than anyone else with a sub 45% TS.  The Jazz have been underdogs in all their recent playoff matchups and while their defensive star may only be a B in the playoffs, their offensive star is gravitating between A+ and D-."
"Ok, c'mon I know youre arguing for him, hes a great top notch defender, but Rudy Gobert is nowhere close to one of the best offensive players in the league. That's just ridiculous."
Did u just compare Rudy Gobert to hitler?

"I think it's largely the fact that Gobert has been able to anchor Utah to the best non-garbage time DRTG in the whole league, as well as the best record, without any other great defensive teammates (maybe Royce) and also [dominating every defensive imaginable stat](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/). That said, I predicted that the media will vote Bam into 3rd this year for DPOY voting and that he will be the odds-on favourite next season."
Rudy Gobert would have a hard time carrying a lineup of Hield/Harris/Robinson defensively
"but Jokic is considered the MVP? he has the media narrative and is amazing this season. in addition to that, Rudy is a defensive monster, you can look up the defensive stats here: [Gobert](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/nba-defensive-rating-leaders-this-season)"
Rudy Gobert. Ben Simmons has also missed quite a few games this season.
"Rudy ""+/- King"" Gobert"
"Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green, and Bam Adebayo are the top 3 right now imo, and then I'd give an honorable mention to Jimmy Butler.  Edit: And another honorable mention to Giannis and Embiid."
Rudy Gobert kissing Draymond Green
The issue with jokic's defense is that people who criticize it don't watch the games. Due to his unique skillset and lack of jumping ability he isn't going to produce the normal defensive stats of a big like Rudy gobert. When Jokic was trying to block shots at the rim he was drawing a lot of fouls and had to be taken out of the game.  Malone knows this and has adjusted the defense to it. The nuggets switch everything at the top and have Jokic clog the paint where they double in the lane if they can. Jokic's job is to alter the path of the person driving the lane and use active hands to get a steal when possible.  When this works it works well. Even when he doesn't get the steal the awkward angle of the drive results in misses and balls falling off the rim for rebounds. Jokic is always in good position to get these rebounds and his ability to bring the ball up and facilitate before the defense gets set allows for easy transition points. This happens from time to time on made baskets as well.  So its not defense that is meant to prevent as many points as possible. It is defense that attempts to lower the points being scored but is mitigated and usually overcome by the offense that is created from being in that set which is where his skillset is most useful.
Nah man Rudy Gobert is the DPOTU he should do it.
"&gt; My issue with gorbert winning defensive player of the year is that he gets this award and routinely has been rendered a ninfactor to slow or stop great offensive players that can operate outside the paint.  For sure, I agree that that has been a problem in previous post seasons. I think he's improved at that this year (it's part of why they can afford to run him with 4 perimeter players).  If you are dismissing Rudy by thinking he's as good a defender as he was in previous seasons, think again. This is the BEST Rudy has ever been defensively.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/"
I love him but I feel like Rudy Gobert is right there... Maybe it's just because I watch so much Jazz but everytime he touches the ball he is complaining about something.
"I want some size! **Ben Simmons - Paul George - Kristaps Porzingis** (only for 3-pointers and back-up defender) - **Anthony Davis - Rudy Gobert** (for me Mitchell number 1 at Jazz because of usage and his clutch time role). Maybe it's not most powerfull team, but I would watch this team play once!"
"So the only thing that qualifies being a center is being the biggest guy in the lineup?   The point I'm getting at is that Jokic plays the role in the Nuggets' offense that is almost always associated with the point guard. People have *general ideas* of what role each position should fill and the playstyle that Jokic has goes beyond a Rudy Gobert or Clint Capela, which is what is usually associated with the center position.   I can understand why people would object to Clint Capela being classified as a guard because they can point to specific aspects of his playstyle and state exactly how it does not align with the characteristics that they use to classify a guard. What are the specific, objective differences between the way Jokic plays and another position?    If, for example, the answer is as simple as just being the largest player in the lineup then that's fine, because at least it's *some* type of objective measurement. But saying ""he's only a center because he only plays center"" is circular logic."
"I won't downvote you for the question. I think it's a legitimate convo.  But you're obviously in the minority.  Jokic is first in win shares this season, with a large lead over Rudy Gobert who's second. Luka is 14th.  Jokic is also a point-center, which is extremely rare and extremely useful. Luka's sort of a point-forward, but mostly just a point guard.  Jokic beats Luka in almost every advanced stat. Luka's metrics aren't (yet) translating to a bunch of wins.   TLDR: Beyond Lebron and Chris Paul, Jokic is probably the best floor general and that's what pushes him beyond Luka."
Rudy Gobert.
"All public statements must be 100% objective and not influenced by current incentives at all. How dare Daryl Morey talk up current Sixers, he should remain 100% objective in his tweets. How mad does Rudy Gobert get when Draymond implies Draymond is the DPOY? If it's more than 0 he's being dumb. This story is basically a guy who's not 8, but 82 complaining ""Jeanie Buss was mean to me by not recognizing my accomplishments."""
"People who make the case for Gobert use stats.  People who make the case for Simmons use feelings.   This shouldn’t even be considered a race at this point. “But Simmons is better in one v one! He can guard one through 5! The eye test says he’s the best!!” Then why don’t ANY of the stats support that narrative?   The reality is this: the same stats that clearly place Rudy as the league’s #1 defender also place Simmons at close to #50. Point blank, if you had one player to build your team’s defense around— Gobert or Simmons— who do you pick? Lol. It’s not close. And for those that wanna use the “stats favor Centers” line, remember that Embiid, Simmons and Thybulle TOGETHER don’t create better team defense than Rudy Gobert + any 4 players the Jazz happen to have on the floor. And those three are ranked 3 of the top 10 defenders in the league, all on the same team. The Jazz have Gobert and that’s it.   The fact that articles like this exist isn’t to bolster Gobert’s case for DPoY. Gobert makes that case on the court; not on begging for the award on ESPN. No, articles like this exist to educate the legions of NBA casuals that are gonna cry when Rudy wins his third award."

Swap Rudy Gobert for any Kings player outside of Fox and we're a playoff team no question
In the real world the NBA is a guard/wing ran league. In the real world Rudy Gobert gets ate alive by any above average guard and wing in the post season. It’s why y’all can’t get out of the first round of the playoffs. Your best defensive player is not great in space at all and when an NBA coach is given the chance to gameplay to take advantage of that y’all get smoked. Why do you think Jamal Murray was giving y’all 50 every game last year in the bubble?? Get Gobert out of the paint and he’s a liability. Every guard/wing in the league thinks that guy is food. You know who they don’t think that about?? Draymond green. Lots of guys SAY they can guard 1 through 5. There’s only one guy who actually DOES IT EVERY GAME. Good day.
"&gt; Ight they’re supposed to have idiotic biased takes  Well, calling a person an idiot for thinking Simmons should be DPOY is the height of idiocy in of itself. NBA.com has had Rudy and Simmons as the #1 on their DPOY ladder most of the season and Rudy has only just [retaken the top spot](https://www.nba.com/news/defensive-player-ladder-rudy-gobert-or-ben-simmons-race-enters-final-week) from Simmons. Personally, and even as a Simmons fan, I think Rudy will get the award but suggesting that the notion of Simmons being in the hunt is ludicrous is just dumb. He's right up there."
reminder that rudy gobert is taking a bad defense and making it good by himself
U joke but I believe Rudy Gobert is more valuable to the jazz than Jokic is to the nugs.
"It's not really that simple, no team in the league plays pure man to man defense. Offenses will run screens specifically to get switches to worse defenders, fast breaks usually force defenses to stick to the closest man. The Jazz don't normally switch on screens unless the defender is completely beat, then Rudy is forced to stop the ball... unfortunately that leaves the screener free against a guard and a lot of bigs get their points against us that way.  The Jazz aren't keeping him away from inside scorers, they are just keeping him inside as much as possible and offenses scheme to try to avoid him. Embiid was the exception, it seemed like he wanted to go at Gobert, and I'll take 20 points on 17 shots against an MVP caliber player any day of the week. 17 shots against Gobert is a LOT more than most players would be willing to take. In fact even Jokic is averaging less than 10 shot attempts against Rudy. Even when teams scheme to avoid him he's still 2nd in the league of shots contested, he's not doing that against centers most of it is against penetrating wings.  Gobert is a paint patrolling defender. He'll absolutely guard on the perimeter if he needs to, and he's very effective when he does, but that leaves the paint unprotected and our wings are real bad perimeter defenders (outside of O'Neale)."
Rudy Gobert did it a couple times
"I wouldn’t be shocked if Gobert gets 5th. All the guards/wings who missed time could split votes on ballots and writers will want to reward Utah. With Conley/Mitchell missing time, Rudy is the only guy to consider from Utah."
"Eh? Green got a combined total of 2 first place votes the years Gobert won, he didn't finish top 5 either year and was barely on the radar. Should have won at least one of those is a baseless statement.  Rudy probably should won have over Draymond in 16-17, defensive statistics heavily favored him. Realistically Draymond won that one because he was well known from the GS playoff runs while most voters barely even knew who Gobert was that year.  14-15 he got more first place votes than Kawhi, though not by a lot.   As far as I can tell he should have at most two, if you give him the one in 14-15 and don't give the 16-17 one to Gobert.  I think he probably has the right amount, but it should have been 14-15 instead of 16-17."
"I think they excelled in different ways. As amazing as I think Rudy is, I think part of the reason he's so good is the way the Jazz use him in their defense. As a Jazz fan I've seen plenty of posts saying Gobert is statistically having the best defensive season of all time, but it'd be hard to say that Dwight couldn't fill the same role and maybe do it better. Tough to know for sure though"
For most of you it's Rudy Gobert.
"Pretty cool pattern where a player is clearly next up for any variety of reasons (improvement, previous DPOY falters or gets injured, shift in perceived value) and ends up winning it the following year.   1984/1985: Mark Eaton  1991/1992: David Robinson  1994/1995: Dikembe Mutombo  2003/2004: Metta World Peace  2011/2012: Tyson Chandler  2016/2017: Draymond Green  2017/2018: Rudy Gobert  2019/2020: Giannis Antetokounmpo"
Well pretty much everybody else feels like Rudy Gobert is the Defensive Player of the Year every year.
KJ was foaming at the mouth to make LBJ join the likes of Rudy Gobert or Marjanovich
Sometimes I feel like Rudy Gobert too when I get the cereal down from the top shelf my first try too.
"Rudy Gobert is 245, Nik Vucevic is 260, Deandre Ayton is 250, Ivica Zubac is 240, etc. Obviously those aren’t going to be exact at any given moment, but I don’t think anybody would describe any of those guys as light"
"I don't mind it, I just wish it were more reasonable. There are legitimate criticisms, he's a half step slow on the perimeter, he's not exactly a versatile offensive weapon, he's clumsy with the ball when he has to dribble. He's very much a specialist who is just one of the best to ever do the things he specializes in.  If someone says ""Hey, I don't think Rudy is an MVP candidate because of his limited offensive versatility"" I can't really argue. I generally maintain that MVP should go to the best 2 way player, so I can accept that. I even accept ""Gobert is at best a top 3 center today"", Embiid and Jokic are fucking nuts.  But it's always stupid shit. It's always ""but I remember one time we scored lots of points"" or ""but switchability"" or ""lol exposed in playoffs"" like we didn't force one of the best offenses in NBA history into several of their worst playoff performances. Almost all the Rudy hate is just the most fundamentally stupid shit."
[Deandre Ayton](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629028/)      [Rudy Gobert](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203497/)      One is 6 years older than the other with almost the same advanced stat line. I would argue Ayton is better under most circumstances because the Jazz team defense is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Suns team defense.
"All NBA level (no)  but he plays with Looney who is very good, he plays with Wiggins who is quite good now.  JTA is also solid and Oubre is as well.  Also Bazemore is a solid wing defender as well.  Really its jist Steph and Jordan Poole who gets major minutes that suck on defense.  The point is he's not as good as Rudy Gobert I didn't say Draymond sucks.  Also in the Denver game he didn't Jokic as well as he used to defend Centers in the past."
"To say talent is as genetic as height... yeah and no. Talent can be inherent, but it's not like there aren't players who were completely average, worked really hard and got very good. To say talent is as genetic as the size you're born into is wack. Sure, there **are** players who are born talented, but there's also the players who are just workhorses who pushed themselves to be incredible. Michael Porter Jr is a great example of the combination.  &gt;and stats this year show he can guard anyone in iso better than **anyone else his size**  Alright, well, again: who's his size? Bol Bol, Tingis Pingis, Ibaka, JaVale, Embiid. I mentioned Boban and Tacko, but they're even **larger**.  It's a no-brainer he's guarding iso better than anyone his size. He's built like a 747 and the best player to be a DPOY candidate (Embiid) has missed too many games to win an end-of-season award. I mean shit, even in wingspan, his only competition is Drummond (by sheer ape indice), Mo Bamba and Whiteside.   I'm not trying to discredit Rudy. I don't know why Jazz fans insist on ""well actually""-ing everything. **I know Rudy Gobert is a highly intelligent and efficient defender.** I'm aware that he does more than camp the paint. I just think that when you shift the competition down to that 6'11 to 6'9 forward size, the players that Bam and Ben (the #2 and #3 in the DPOY race) are outperforming are of much higher quality than the players that Rudy (who is 7'1 with a 7'9 wingspan) are outplaying."
Is that why they let Rudy Gobert and a squad of role players score 116 points?
This.  The narrative of 'Gobert getting exposed' should really be 'The Jazz getting exposed''.   There's only so much Rudy can do.
Rudy Gobert is basically a one man top ten defense.  He has very few defensive talents around him.  Draymond while great isn't as good as he once was as evident by the facts that he can't guard bigger fives anymore.  Once he slimmed down he sort of lost defensive value at the 5 in order to have better conditioning.
&gt;You can neutralise Gobert but Bam switches everything  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/bendowsett/2020/06/29/rudy-goberts-improved-perimeter-defense-is-an-major-tool-for-the-utah-jazz/?sh=11a0984a75c5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bendowsett/2020/06/29/rudy-goberts-improved-perimeter-defense-is-an-major-tool-for-the-utah-jazz/?sh=11a0984a75c5)  Gobert is one of the best isolation defenders in the league. You can't just switch onto him and score.
DPOY is like MVP during the Jordan years in that it's really silly if Rudy Gobert doesn't win every year because he is literally the only man in the league who is a one man defense.
"Jokic better... Embiid better..  Luka  better... Giannis better... Westbrook better... Chris Paul better..  Orange Julius better...  Dame better...  Steph better..  Booker better.. Rudy Gobert better... Kawhi better.. Kyrie better... Donovan Mitchell better.. Jimmy Butler better..      I mean, you're so confused you listed KD who is an even more injury prone. almost washed up mega star..      LMAO."

"Gobert and the Jazz genuinely believe he is the best defensive player of all time. Rudy seems to be accepting that unique forms of greatness aren't easily appreciated at first.  For me, gobert is as good as anyone player I've seen this century on defense. I'd probably prefer KG if I really had to choose, but if gobert isn't in your top 3-4 you'd have a lot of explaining to do."
Rudy Gobert is a fucking worm 🪱
"I mean, he didn't shit on Gobert, he's just saying if you only watch Sixers games and not every Jazz game, then your opinion on Rudy is skewed.  We definitely memed it up when Simmons had his career high against the Jazz this year, but its pretty obvious that wasn't all on Rudy."
"Rudy isn’t going to stop everyone that comes at him. Switching into guards like Curry, Booker, Kyrie, etc. is still probably a bad idea because those guys are just unreal on the offensive end. The fact Gobert can lock up the paint and guard 85% of the guards in the league if needed is a massive advantage"
Need a job at NASA to understand the statistics people use to tell me Rudy Gobert is good
"Off topic ish, but I’m thinking career blocks will not be broken. Hakeem leads with 3,830 (assuming regular season there). But the more emphasis on threes and pulling bigs away from the rim, it will be tough to see a time when another guy averages 3 a game for his career.   Hakeem topped out at 4.6/game in 1990 and bottomed out at 1.5 in 2002 for those interested.   For comparison, Rudy Gobert is leading the league this season (and having his career best in terms of quantity) at 2.7/game."
"i think it has a lot to do with the fact there’s a huge chance if Rudy wasn’t born a genetic freak (by NBA standards, even) at 7’1 with a 7’9 wingspan, he’d be 50 slots further down. If he were born 6’1, he’d be at French Walmart. Sure, he’s not just paint-camping; he’s got his screens, his sheer presence, his length on the perimeter. Not denying his impact.  ... but Bam and Ben are both above average genetically (again, even by NBA standards) and there are far more 6’9/6’10 forwards in the league to compare them to, in which they’re completely above and beyond everyone else.   Rudy’s competition in terms of sheer build are names like Tacko, Boban, Kristaps — I guess to an extent, AD in terms of sheer wingspan/ape indice — but these are primarily names of players not known to be defensive stalwarts. Gobert is winning a footrace against people in walkers.  Ben and Bam’s competition is found everywhere. LeBron, Giannis, Capela, AD, Nerlens, Siakam, Anunoby, Turner — these are just SOME names. They’re just outsprinting real runners right now. The case can be made for either Bam or Ben; I’m gonna be a homer and vouch Bam for the sheer rim protection, but isn’t it just a **little** wack that Gobert can have an award handed to him because “his presence alone is a deterrent!”?"
"yeah, shame they have to face the legendary rudy gobert and don mitch led utah jazz instead, omg, je suis shitting my pantalons"
"I want to add Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell to this. THE NUGGETS DIDN’T REALLY DRAFT THEM. We traded the pick and told them who to draft for us. So all the people saying “nuggs could have had them all” are not at all accurate, cause the nugs never intended on picking them, that was all us."
"Why would I hold an injury against someone?  That's totally different than it being obvious that someone becomes a schematic liability when teams lock in.  Being capable of a thing can be different than doing the thing.  If Mitchell twists an ankle and Gobert is a defensive force in a 6 game loss, I'd believe in Rudy."
"Bam, he DOES do everything on defense. Unfortunately, the one defensive thing Rudy Gobert does he does so well that nothing's really gonna sway em."
"I’m sorry Bam. Not this year, buddy  People talk about heliocentric offenses that run through one guy like Harden, Trae, Luka. Utah’s defense is equally reliant on the play of Rudy Gobert."
"**First Team:** Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert.   **Second Team:** Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, Mikal Brudges, Joel Embiid.  Honestly, I really considered going the ""cheating route"" of using Bam and Embiid as ""forwards"" to include Bam and Myles Turner. Shout-outs to Clint Capela, Matisse Thybulle and Paul George too."
"iverson  klay  danny green  gordon hayward  rudy gobert  all in their best season, would be a nice team"
Ill chose the entire defensive system that's named rudy gobert over the guy that is a great iso defender. Simmons is awesome but he's legitimately the 3rd best defender on his team.
Jrue Holiday (for perimeter defense) - prime AI (scoring + hustle) - late Lebron (dominant ball-handler along with AI) - KD (before last injury -&gt; great defense) - Rudy Gobert/Ben Wallace (or another great rim protector..maybe Mutombo..that way this team will be closer to reality=)
"You are probably joking, but still... https://www.nba.com/news/defensive-player-ladder-rudy-gobert-or-ben-simmons-race-enters-final-week   Hes not even top 10"
Doubt he cares about Rudy Gobert lmao. He’s a great matchup for LeBron.
"Gobert should be unanimous.  His defensive rating 100.8 which is insane considering the  offense that's going on in the league.  Also, 2.7 blks/gm.  [https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/rudy-gobert-defensive-rating-this-season](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/rudy-gobert-defensive-rating-this-season)  It's debatable if Simmons is even the best defender on his own team lol.  Come at me Philly fans"
Sooo... not Rudy Gobert then?
Can’t have two shitty perimeter defenders in your backcourt. It’s not like Rudy Gobert and Kevin Garnet are their 4 and 5.
"On screen assist Gobert was 2nd last season, 1st in 2019, 1st in 2018 and 1st in 2017 too (with gortat).  I think that maybe Rudy is decent at setting screens."
"Rudy Gobert is a future HOFer, easy top-10 player in the NBA, and on the short list of best defensive Center to ever play the game."
&gt;Screen Assists - Rudy Gobert (415)  Now.  Then.  Forever.    ^^^Sod ^^^off ^^^Sabonis.
Yes. That's the whole point of being a high seed. Rudy Gobert will be FMVP.

"All counted equally although 10 steals and 10 blocks would be the most impressive just because youll rarely if ever see those stats by themselves. 10 assists is probably the most valuable category because it means your responsible for at least 20 or more of your team's points. You could also make an argument for 10 steals being more valuable because of the defense leading to offense tradeoff. Scoring at least 10 points is the easiest, least important, and least impressive of the categories. For a top player, youre expected to score more than that every game, even for valuable players that arent typical scorers (ie Rudy Gobert)  5×5's are also a popular counting metric in the nba with the 5 boxscore metrics that could make up a triple double. Theyre even more rare bc the steals and blocks are just that hard to accumulate especially together. Funny enough Draymond Green missed a 5x5 game either last season or the season prior on points (he only scored 4pts)"
"I think he's gonna end up top 5 in DPOY voting. He certainly has an argument, the Warriors are somehow a top 5 defense despite having like no defensive personnel outside of Draymond and Wiggins, but just like Steph I'm pretty sure their record is holding him back.  Also Rudy Gobert is the DPOY and it's not really a conversation at this point"
"&gt;As a Timerwolves fan and someone who’s post I actually enjoyed I expected better from you in this comment. Ayton has not been disappointing in the slightest this year and you saying that is proof you don’t know what you’re talking about. Ayton is one of the key reasons the Suns are the #2 team in the NBA. He’s 23 the rock of our fantastic defense, extremely efficient and one of the best rebounders in the NBA.   I mentioned in a comment below how defence is not an issue with Ayton but if I am trading away KAT I wanted a franchise cornerstone not Rudy Gobert lite. Do you think his offensive game has developed as much as you had hoped?"
"   &gt;Russell Westbrook has been accused over the years of ""padding"" stats by grabbing rebounds from teammates. Offensive rebounds are much harder to fake. This year he is averaging 11.6 total rebounds, vs last years 7.9. But the rub is that his offensive rebounds have dropped from 1.8 to 1.7.  Fantastic analysis and point. Russell Westbrook, 6'3 point guard does not have the 2nd most rebounds in the league. He is tragically being beaten by the likes of 6'10 Jonas Valanciunas and 7'1 Rudy Gobert. It'd be a shame if someone realized that RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS 6'3. Easier to fake? It's ridiculous for a 6'3 Guard to be top 50 in ORebounding, DRebounding is much easier and height is less of a factor."
**highlight of Rudy getting outplayed**   Oh fuck yea I’m about to NUT  **it’s not Rudy Gobert**  sorry little guy maybe next time
Rudy and the Gobert of Fire
&gt; Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert needed several years to emerge as a starting center.  Read the damn article.
[Never Forget the Rudy Gobert dance-off](https://youtu.be/3Jcfcv2af3o)
Rudy is overpaid I agree with Shaq. The jazz are just gonna get steamrolled in the playoffs by a legit contender. I’ll put 1000 on it with anyone who thinks they won’t lmao. The jazz might be the fakest good team I’ve seen in recent history. Gobert gets eaten alive by any young athletic center like capela in the rockets series
"&gt; Where did you get Rudy is much better as a scorer? Gobert is 12 ppg scorer. Mostly on lobs. Simmons is 16 ppg and can create his own shot.   I think you are mistaken on your numbers?  This year Rudy is scoring 14.3ppg on .683TS%, missing 2.7fgapg.    Simmons is scoring an identical 14.3ppg on .582TS%, missing 4.5fgapg.  I see NO way in which you can manipulate that in favour of Simmons. They score the same amount, yet Gobert is more efficient and needs fewer attempts to do so.  &gt; Better at defense how?   Gober is the premier rim protector in the league. That's the most valuable defensive skill to have, and he's the best at it. Simmons is also a great defender and is better on perimeter defense, but what Gobert does is more impactful in terms of improving his team defense."
Rudy Gobert is the best rim protector in the league.
also Morris Sr? morelike Morris Chestnut  cuz he had Rudy Gobert looking like Vivica A. Fox
"man, some of these Jazz lack of defense highlights…  Morris Sr? morelike Morris Chestnut  cuz he had Rudy Gobert looking like Vivica A. Fox"
Which DPOY candidate playing better defense right now? People putting way too much weight into a guard being faster than Rudy Gobert
2018 - Rudy Gobert  2019 - Rudy Gobert
"Lowkey if you put draymond on this jazz team instead of gobert, they would be unstoppable. Lockdown defense, switch heavy, still provide rim protection and dray just as trash as rudy on offense lol. Reggie and PG were cooking rudy out there."
"Yeah people are saying Rudy got cooked in the 4th.  In the fourth quarter tonight the Clippers ran 8 total picks at Gobert. They scored 2 total points.  Rudy was not the issue on defence, or at the very least, the only issue"
In 20 years Rudy Gobert will be best remembered for touching some microphones
"This sub really is fooled by advanced stats lmao, when will yall realize this aint baseball. Anybody with 2 eyes and a brain knows AD is better than Gobert come playoff time but nah since Rudy has higher T.R.A.S.H. rating than him he’s obviously the better player. Rudy is a regular season player through and through."
Jazz have to find a way to punish the clippers for not playing a center. Gobert has zero offensive game but maybe give him the green light to go for offensive boards?  I get that most teams opt to head back on defense early to stop transition opportunities but Rudy just leaves his guy unguarded in the corner anyways so might as well go for the rebound and try to get some extra possessions
"Rudy was the only one that showed heart in the second half. The role players need to stay in front of their man because they depend too much on Gobert to help them, which leads to drive and kick situations."
Like I'm baffled why this is asked and I'd love to see the thread that said Rudy fucken gobert is a better player
"agreed, especially when they started talking about how logan paul and rudy gobert should box"
"I can't understand Rudy Gobert.   Offensively, he's getting boxed out by much smaller players, and he's never near the rim. Defensively, no one is afraid to attack him. He's always used size as a fear-tactic, but he's soft as all hell. He also plays like he has hulk hands on. I've never seen someone so big play so afraid.   But he wins things, so i'm told he's great."
"The Jazz are not as good as some say, but I don’t think they’re embarrassing like the Bucks or Sixers have been. Nobody had expectations for Utah. They had a good run, but maybe some of it was luck, and it’s beginning to run out.   They definitely shoulda taken advantage of an injured Kawhi, but Spida is hurt and Conley is out too. I don’t think there’s any need to be too harsh on them. They were hot, but finally cooled off. Just not the best time for it to happen.   Shame for them, but I wouldn’t be that concerned except maybe about Rudy Gobert."
ce n'est pas rudy gobert
It’s not crazy. They have Rudy Gobert. He gets exposed when teams go small in the playoffs every year. He’s good but this just always happens.
"100 comments and cant find a single Utah flair.   Just putting these out here:  Paul ""doesnt perform against Jazz"" George  Paul ""Ingles' son"" George  Rudy ""worth the max"" Gobert"
LOL RUDY GOBERT SO IMPORTANT TO YOUR TEAM AND DPOY CANT EVEN STOP PEOPLE FROM SCORING
Rudy Gobert is legit one of the most overrated players in the league. DPOY gets played off the floor every playoffs and people still suck him off for his supposed “intangibles.”
People owe Shaq an apology for his Rudy Gobert takes.
Rudy Gobert was a defensive liability
It's simple. Rudy Gobert is one of the best regular season players and turns into a role player come playoff time.
Rudy Gobert…I have never seen a DPOY who gets run around to this extent in the playoffs.
Everyone blaming Gobert but Donovan Mitchell is a bad liability on defense. Man doesn’t even try causing Rudy to step out and then the Clippers just swing it to the open man over and over again
How tf is Rudy Gobert the DPOY?
It’s Rudy Gobert.
"Rudy Gobert disastrous class when you need him most smh, I’m sick."
"Rudy Gobert needs to give that DPOY up, man gets abused in the playoffs"
I don’t know why but watching Rudy gobert go for loose balls is comedic
Reggie Jackson &gt; Rudy Gobert?
Reggie Jackson looking like a HOFer and Rudy Gobert actually looking like Baguette Biyombo tonight. This is the darkest timeline.
"Be a good time for the best player on the Jazz, Rudy Gobert to close this out."
Imagine if Gobert was with Trae... I know Clint is awesome too but that Trae-Rudy connection in the 2020 all star game was insane.
Lmao it’s a crime to nba history that Rudy Gobert has 3 DPOY awards.
Rudy Gobert is a sorry ass perimeter defender even for a big man. Foot work is dog water and he looks lost. DPOY has to be versatile and able to guard inside and out. That ain’t him
Rudy DPOY Gobert BTW LMAOOOOOOOOOA
"Watched the Hawks plenty. Atlanta has been a bottom-10 rated defense all year.  But hey, if you want to pretend like he’s Ben Wallace, or even Rudy Gobert, then just go right ahead."
Rudy Rodman Gobert
Gobert finally remembered he is DPOY. Where was this earlier Rudy?
"Rudy ""Ole Reliable"" Gobert"
Oh I just noticed Rudy Gobert is on their team.
Rudy Gobert is officially on my betting blacklist
"1st Team All Regular-Season   Frontcourt:    Giannis Antetokounmpo, Rudy Gobert  Backcourt? - who you got?"
Rudy Gobert getting boxed out by Mann. just wow
"nobody would think Rudy Gobert is soft if he didn't pull his leg there lol.  Ty Lue is probably the most infamous step over victim and it clearly didn't damage his rep in the league.  They're pretty irrelevant in their life tho. Like Rudy Gobert and Marcus Morris interaction ends at the game.  Why does Rudy Gobert care if Marcus Morris thinks he's ""invisible"". He is clearly not invisible lol he's a 3x DPOY on the best team.  It just comes off as thin skin and self-esteem issues to get so ornery over what is a slightly dickish move"
Rudy Gobert really gone win FMVP.   I'll rage quit.
Just thinking about the fact we’re going to see a Rudy Gobert or Bojan Bogdonavic FMVP
I’d take Rudy Gobert shooting a free throw over Simmons
Zubac ain't bad. Rudy Gobert is a better FT shooter than Ben Simmons.
Can Rudy Gobert get covid-21 so I don't have to watch basketball anymore?
"I hate Rudy gobert’s covid spreading, George Floyd conspiracy boosting, trying to flop for a tech literally on the bench lookin ass. I fucking hate gobert. I want to see him cry again. People compare this bitchmade bastard to Ben Wallace but that is downright insulting.   The players throwing shade for being under appreciated in the all star team selection when they haven’t accomplished anything in the playoffs is laughable. They think they’re great and that Jordan Clarkson is suddenly a championship quality player because they went hard AF in the regular season which saw teams devastated from covid protocols and injuries. Many teams clearly were prioritizing rest. If cp3 is out too, they very well may waltz into the finals and play exclusively teams which face massive injuries besides the 1st round against an 8 seed."
"Lol Chris Paul has been roasting Rudy gobert his whole career, that’s why he dominated em in Houston and why we swept them this year"
That’s future nba champ Rudy gobert /s
Y’all cannot let Rudy Gobert get to the finals please
Is Rudy Gobert a role player?
"Lebron has 5 all defense first team selections and 1 all defense second team selection. RW is a hustle player on both sides of the ball. Other than harden, this was a garbage take.  Also players like Ben Simmons, Rudy Gobert, and Draymond Green all got max contracts for being elite defensive players while being average on the offensive end."
"I'm saying it now, Giannis is just Rudy Gobert without the BBIQ.   Both guys can only rim run. Giannis has the elite athleticism to be the most dominant rim runner in the league. But Rudy has the BBIQ to know his role on offense."
This day has got to be worse than the Rudy Gobert day when Tom Hanks got coronavirus
Rudy Gobert is about to sleepwalk his way to a ring...cancel everything
"MJ was the exception because at that point there was no max contract or luxury tax collectively bargained. Jordan made like $4 Million up until 1996 when he had already won 3 titles. Since the Bulls had his Bird Rights, they were able to surpass the salary cap in order to sign Jordan. The contract they offered was 122% more than the entire Salary Cap for the 1998 season. [source](https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/how-michael-jordans-salary-surpassed-nba-salary-cap-consecutive-seasons).   To prove my point a little more, $33 Million in 1998 is roughly equal to $50 Million in today’s dollars. There is a legitimate chance that within the next 3 years that is the average annual salary of super max contract. Some elite players in the very near future will be earning more than entire teams could spend to field a team in 1998 in terms of purchasing power.   Jordan is a GOAT-tier player, compared to his peers he is unquestionably the best player. Soon players of John Wall or Rudy Gobert are going make similar money as Jordan. (Not trying to downplay had great those players are, it’s just to point how more common that type of money will come in the NBA.) also, Jordan getting paid that much was absurd in 1998, pretty sure he alone made more that season then the Jazz team he played in the finals."
Rudy Gobert playing the long game.  Brought Covid to the NBA only to take advantage now (only assuming they beat Clippers cause of the Kawhi injury too)
"&gt;Size is a negative unless you're skilled and fast.  I mean that's just not true. A slow, lumbering, skill-less 7 footer is going to be a hell of a lot more valuable than a slow, lumbering, skill-less 6 footer.   A guy like Rudy Gobert is not exactly known for his blistering speed or his supreme offensive touch, but he's obviously extremely valuable in the league. If you want to say ""well defense is a skill"" then yes, but that's part of the value of size. A tall person can affect shots much more effectively than a short person. If Rudy Gobert was 6' 3 he'd be out of the league.  Yes, being tall and also having guard skills is obviously extremely valuable. But you don't have to have those skills in order to contribute positively as a big man."
Remember Rudy Gobert?
We really might Rudy Gobert lift up that Finals MVP trophy....let that sink in
"*Rudy Gobert licking the microphones for his moment, again*"
The irony of Rudy Gobert hoisting the trophy would be even greater
He made an All-NBA team. His name is Rudy Gobert.
"Idk what you’re even arguing, Giannis is long and athletic and annually in contention for DPOY. Maybe if you had a healthy Kyrie and Harden you’d have a point, but you gotta try to put Giannis on him.  Also the comparison to Rudy Gobert was disingenuous, the lateral quickness alone makes it an unworkable comp."
at this rate giannis is a greek rudy gobert. in the playoffs he should only camp the paint to deter people from going into the paint and catch lobs on offense.
"People focus too much on the bad with Ben Simmons.  The reality is that he’s never really had a viable jumpshot, and has always been years and years of muscle memory away from developing one. The foundation just isn’t there.  That being said, he’s the best defender in the league outside of Rudy Gobert, a fantastic passer and is a super high IQ player.  He’s not LeBron or Giannis and was never going to be. He’s Ben Simmons."
"He got crossed by KD so many times early in the game. He got killed by him in the first two games two. He's an elite help defender, but can't move his feet quick enough to be an elite wing defender. It's like saying Rudy Gobert should cover KD because he's a multiple DPOY and 1st team Defense."
"It's insane how many people don't understand why giannis is a good defender. Giannis is good at playing help defense and protecting the rim. Giannis absolutely cannot guard KD. He is not quick enough laterally and he sucks trying to get around screens. Of course giannis isnt going to guard KD when there are at least 2 better options on the team in middleton and tucker. Even jrue holiday would be a debatably better choice.  Defense isn't so simple as your best defender guards their best player. You wouldn't have rudy gobert guard KD either, or kawhi for the series hes in, and hes the actual DPOY  I expect dumb ass takes like this from reddit analysts, but not from actual nba players"
in the playoffs giannis is a glorified rudy gobert imo
*Calls Rudy Gobert*
"Okay great, so you're mostly right. Before I explain where I think you're wrong let me explain how basketball changes in the playoffs compared to the regular season.   Playoff basketball is a game of give and take, you take what the defense gives you, they adjust, you find the new weakness, rinse and repeat.   You are right about shot deterrence/rim protection (I qualify these as the same strength). Utah's defense is excellent because they have good all around perimeter defenders with Gobert spearheading the paint.   There are two ways you can attack Utah's drop defense:  1) Single out Gobert in isolation with an elite guard. You touched on this with one of his weaknesses being poor footspeed on the perimeter  2) Midrange jumpers to open up the offense. Good midrange shot creators (e.g., Kawhi) can get their shot when they want against Utah's defense because they strategically concede them.   This works well in the regular season when teams are just running default schemes and not practicing midrange jumpers to prepare for Utah. In the postseason however, teams adjust and that's why at least over the last couple years you see that Utah's defense, while consistently top 5 in the regular season, routinely gets worse in the playoffs. Part of this is because they're playing better teams but that just adds to my point, better teams can exploit Utah's weaknesses  Another point to consider is that players naturally adjust to each other over the course of a series. A couple years back Harden would struggle to get the same calls he got in the regular season the longer a series went on, because teams would adjust to his alien-like movements that he'd use to draw fouls and stop making the same mistakes.   Similarly, teams get used to Gobert's commanding presence in the paint. Unlike players like Draymond or Giannis however, Gobert isn't versatile enough as a defender to be able to adjust back. It's not his fault, he has slow lateral movement and reflexes.   Now for offense. Gobert's finishing is one of my biggest gripes in his game. He can ""finish"" well when he finds the open lane, which to his credit he can do with consistency (although those lanes get closed in the playoffs). But if you give Gobert the ball in the low block with a mismatch like a PG or someone, he doesn't have a soft touch to lay the ball up and in.   His hands are also bad (they used to be awful, so he's improved a bit). This is partially why as you mentioned he's a bad decision maker with the ball in his hands. Things move so quickly in the NBA and the half second of awareness Gobert loses because he has to focus on catching the ball, ends up costing him opportunities for assists.    Now for Mitchell:   Mitchell is one of the best players I've ever seen at splitting the double team. In the playoffs this is especially valuable because he's leaving two players behind and getting to play 4v3 on offense. This leads to dumps to Gobert, or quality layups most of the time.   If you don't double him then he can either create a shot on the perimeter or beat his man off the dribble for a midrange pull up or layup. I'd combine undisciplined shot selection, tunnel vision and middling court vision into 1 weakness, that being tunnel vision. When Donovan tunnels he very often misses his teammates for wide open shots. He also gambles a lot on defense, for the most part he can get away with it because Utah is so elite at recovering but it does lead to open shots for the opposing team so I'll give you that.  Why I think Donovan is better. Less of his game is compromised by playoff basketball, while Rudy has a hard time adjusting to changing gameplans, Donovan's game is built for adjustment. If you try to take away his first option to score by doubling, he'll split the double and create a second option for himself.   Rudy's value on the other hand, is primarily defensive. If you're immobile then you can't adjust as easily, which can allow opposing teams to exploit him.     My biggest reason for picking Donovan though is that he never quits on the team. If Rudy doesn't get the ball for many possessions in a row, he disengages and has atrocious body language. Just yesterday when the Jazz were fighting to make a comeback, Rudy wasn't positioning himself well for rebounds, wasn't being active on offense, and was making poor decisions.   I ended up writing way more than I expected so   TL;DR Rudy exploitable, disengages when things aren't going his way, has a harder time adjusting in the playoffs. Also Offense &gt; Defense in general but especially in the playoffs."
Wonder if people were this outraged when Rudy Gobert won DPOY while playing 56/81 games.
"**No “hurt” NBA caliber player is getting 21 rebounds in a playoff game**   Embiid is only making excuses. A 7fter with a ***torn meniscus*** doesn’t get 21 rebounds in a game.  By your logic, Rudy gobert should have 2000 rebounds per season.   So… just so I understand your logic…. The hawks are the reason an injured Embiid got 21 rebounds?"
"tbf, all else aside, Simmons did give Rudy ""3x DPOY"" Gobert a 40 piece earlier this year"
Nah Kawhi vs KD would be amazing to watch. Giannis vs Rudy Gobert would put me to sleep
Nobody can shut down Alex Len and Bismack Biyombo like Rudy Gobert I will give you that
"I love rudy's defense and I do believe he should be all nba 2nd team over embiid because of his impact on winning however, the point that all nba/defensive teams are very dependant on the competition in the position and to put it mildly the defensive center of the past decade have been utter garbage in historic comparison outside of rudy gobert and draymond."
"I mean I’d say it’s a combination of eye test and the stats. Granted, as we know defensive metrics are notoriously unreliable in small quantities but looking at everything, they all seem to agree Rudy this season is top tier.   He has the best defensive on-off splits since 06.   In 538, He has [the best Defensive RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Willie%20Cauley-Stein&amp;season=2020) since they started recording in ‘13.   In ESPN, He has the best [defensive Real plus-minus](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM) since they’d started recording in ‘96.   In Dunks and Threes, he’s tops in their [defensive estimates plus-minus](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm) which spans back to 2014.   By Bball-Index, he has the best [D-Lebron rating](https://www.bball-index.com/lebron-database/) since they’d started recording in 09.   Even if we look at goberts “weaknesses” he stands out among the other centers in the league. In p&amp;r, he only allows 0.851 points per possession which is lowest in the league among all centers who defended at least 300 of those plays over the season (parameter there to exclude players who barely played and thus have small sample size).   Even in plays where’s he’s getting ISO’s against, he only allows .779 points per possession which is 4th lowest among players who defended 125+ of them.   He’s also statistically the best close-out center in the league, allowing the least points per possession when closing out to a shooter.   Now a lot of these metrics don’t go back to hakeem or even Duncan’s early years which is why I didn’t say he has unequivocally the best defensive season ever, but it’s really odd that you’d act like I’m just making shit up. Pretty much every measurable metric has Gobert number 1 and in most cases it isn’t particularly close"
"People like to compare him to Draymond, but he doesn't play like Dray on offence at all. Dary is most often used as a roll man or DHO guy. And, even as limited Dray's game is he still shoots over 40% of shots outside 10 feet.   Simmons, sometimes I don't know what he supposed to be doing on offence. He can't run pick and roll. He has Rudy Gobert shot chart taking less than 10% of his shots outside 10 feet. And, is hardly used as a roll man, only getting in that action half as often as Dray."
"Just depends on matchup.  Was shit for him against the mavs but he’s been playing really well against the jazz.  You know who had the most blocks in the game yesterday? Ill give you a hint, it wasn’t DPOY Rudy Gobert…"
"This Rudy Gobert love is weirdest thing on this sub. It’s not even debatable who the best player is. Do people do it to show they’re smart or something?  We are literally doubling/trapping Mitchell every time down the floor, and leaving anybody to guard Gobert. We’re barely playing our Center and he still can’t score.   On offense our small ball is putting him in rotation and foul trouble, he can’t live with the drive and kick threes. Yes he’s an elite rim-protector but calling one your best player is asinine. He’s not Dwight Howard, who was a focal point of a championship contender."
"Thybulle deserves being there, idk if you saw him play but he is one of most disruptive player and he covers such a large area its almost inhuman like some shots are not a possibility just cus he is in the game for example floaters and stepbacks, if Im not wrong i saw a that he blocked the most floaters and he almost doubles the next man that is Rudy Gobert if i remember correctly And thats without speaking of his best quality, recovering, there isnt a more dangerous man to try to screen and then shoot   I really like watching him play but i think thats obvious by now"
I remember when people thought Hayward wasn't going to get paid after he shot 30% from 3 and and was just down overall down in shooting his 4th year. Jazz were greedy and didn't max him right away. Charlotte Maxed him with a player option that the Jazz were forced to sign and he opted out and got to leave there early. Jazz got lightning in a bottle with Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell shortly after that though but at the time it was a dark time for them.
"""Cant get blocks if they wont shoot over you"" - Rudy Gobert, probably"
"This is not true, we look absolutely abysmal without Gobert and this is a casual take. Mitchell is the scorer in the fourth quarter who will visually win a game, Gobert is the reason their two stars won’t touch the paint for 36 minutes a night and keep us in the game in the first place.   Our guards are 6’0” and 6’1”, our forwards are 6’4” and 6’8”. we are undersized in general and Rudy makes up for that by being the best rim protector in the league. Our defense looks so great because our perimeter defenders can play the 3 ball insanely tight and not care about being blown by.  Kawhi had at least 6 times today in the second half where he drove to the basket untouched and turned to pass it out. That doesn’t happen if basically anyone else is there. Rudy is the best defensive player in the league in part because he’s literally amazing at what he does and in part because his whole team’s defensive scheme is built around him and he literally carries it.   Highest plus minus in the league this year. He is a game changer and would be the best player on most teams in the league. Mitchell is a great scoring guard who needs his team to be in the game for him to do his thing and take his credit."
Rudy Gobert trick yall man.
"Gobert is a better regular season player. The best teams have the talent to gameplan a little tighter and press on teams minor flaws, which Gobert does have. While he's absolutely a solid perimeter defender, it's happening consistently that the Clippers are able to force switches and take him further away from the paint than he's comfortable with. Even when they don't attack him explicitly, they've been able to attack with other players and delay Gobert's help defence, or grab offensive boards due to Rudy being out of position. The Jazz spent the whole season funnelling towards Gobert but when he's not there, the principles they've been practicing all year are harder to execute."
Jazz fans know Mitchell is our best player. Rudy Gobert is however our most important player. Without him the Jazz are in Cancun right now.
"Bro, why even comment if you didn't even watch the game? Congrats on reading a box score. If you actually watched the game you would have seen how they abused favors the second Rudy was off the court and the multiple instances PG drove in the paint on Gobert only to turn it over."
"Patrick ""Too Fucking Small"" Beverly got 4 blocks, the most in the game. 3x DPOY winner Rudy Gobert got 1.   Back to back 30 point games for Kawhi and PG."
"It came from the fact that in games where the Jazz where missing an All-Star from their back court, Gobert's defence was incredible enough to allow us to go 21-7 in that regular season stretch.      Back in 2017-18 too, Mitchell's rookie year, the Jazz lost 16 of 20 games midseason when Gobert was injured but then won 30 of 35 to end the year when he came back. Again that stretch coincidenced with defensive records being smashed.      Rudy's amazing but I think Mitchell has surpassed him by now, it's a valid argument in the regular season but playoffs are a different game and Donny elevates while Rudy is mostly the same."
"This is where you need scoring and your star/max player in Rudy can't step up. Gobert is one of the greatest defenders ever but, he needs to develop his scoring game."
"Sure. But it's hard to make the case that Gobert is both a defensive and offensive liability if the Jazz have gained points on the Clippers while he's been playing, in a relatively small 31 minutes of play.  If the Jazz were really playing 4 vs 5 on both ends with Rudy, the Clippers would be abusing Utah whenever he was on the floor."
Rudy Gobert is nonexistent on the offensive end and is a liability against the clippers' small-ball lineup.
❗️fun fact❗️  Rudy Gobert is the only player in NBA history
"the jazz still had the #1 overall defense solely due to rudy gobert, but you’re right that their system got exposed due to their heavy reliance on a rim protector. part of it is also the fact that they didn’t have the personel or desire to go small and match the clippers but i see what you’re saying"
"If you paid a moderately athletic 6’9 man with a 8’10 wingspan $40 million/year just to train every day, then yes I am fairly confident that they would be as successful as Giannis. Rudy Gobert is only giving him props because he is in the same boat and knows it"
"Rudy Gobert imo.   Awesome defensive center but it seems like everytime I watch a jazz game he's getting gameplaned out by getting hunted on switches onto a perimeter shot creater or having a beefy post player bully him around down low since he's light in the ass and relies on his length/positioning to rebound, or he's in foul trouble.   Like to me it seems there's a simple gameplan to reduce his effectiveness and otherwise he's a shot blocker so you can get him into foul trouble pretty easily as you know you can bait him to go for the blocks.   But in all seriousness it does seem to be about half the time I watch him that's the case, the other half he's got great D and is meh on O lol"
Rudy Gobert. He has won DPOY 3 of the last 4 years and every playoffs he gets 1. Fully exposed in a pick and roll and 2. shot off the floor by a team who can shoot 3s
My answer will always be Rudy Gobert.
"I used to think Gobert was the most overrated center in the league before these last playoffs. I know people will disagree because they lost, but, Rudy is a fucking defensive savant, some of his defense on the perimeter was insane for a dude as big and lanky as he is. I also don't mind him not being a scorer but my favorite era was also the 2000's."
"There's a picture of Rudy Gobert and Mark Eaton standing by one of his bikes, Rudy looks like a little kid next to Mark."
1 Sabonis   2 Lillard   3 Chris Paul   4 Jamal Murray   5 Bradley Beal   6 Jimmy Butler   7 Tyler Herro   8 Cameron Payne   9 Rudy Gobert    10 Julius Randle
"I've argued in the past that Gobert gets way too much blame for what down. It was more the fault of the perimeter defenders, Snyder for leaving him to defend a small ball lineup. and bad luck that the Clippers got insanely hot at just that right now.   There's a reason Lue didn't go the 5 small strategy until they were 20 points down in the 3rd quarter of an elimination game - over the long-term it probably doesn't work.  But that's not what I want to talk about...  Overall, Mitchell was signficantly better than Gobert in the playoffs. But, there is virtually no coorelation between players who perform above/below their regular season stats in the playoffs one year, and how they perform the next year. BY FAR the biggest predictive factor is how they perform in the regular season. The idea of a ""playoff perfomer"" isn't totally bunk, but it's *barely* outside of a normal standard deviation.   Similarly, there are some differences between regular season play and the playoffs, but they are not nearly as significant as the NBA marketing wants you to believe. (If anybody cares I have stats to back this up). Even annecdotally, how many players have you heard aren't playoff performers, only for them to suddenly have a really great playoffs? Hell, everybody said Giannis couldn't perform in the playoffs because that ""Giannis wall"" was unbeatable.  I'm done.. but take away from this 2 things:   * the concept of consistant playoff performance is 98% myth * Blaming Rudy for the Game 6 colllapse, is like saying Gary Payton was a shit defender because whenever he got switched onto Shaq he got abused. Every great defender has a weakness, it's the team's job to not let the opposing offense take advange of those weaknesses"
"I don't care if rudy gobert is a ""class act"" he's a basketball player and he deserves slander for this past playoffs, he's not being slandered for anything else."
Rudy Gobert is a really nice guy that gets a lot of hate from NBA twitter
Just how fucking stupid is Rudy Gobert??
"Mitchell was on one leg dropping 40 on heavily contested shots yet again these playoffs and on top of that he actually tries on the other end. How many ridiculous playoff performances does he need to get some respect? He is better than Booker, dont blame him or let what happened with Rudy Gobert diminish your guys’ opinions."
"Had a lot to do with the problems that eventually showed up in the playoffs. No other good defenders and the backup center spot was an absolute nightmare. We were still an elite-ish defense with Rudy on the floor and either last or close to last with him off. Several advanced individual numbers including DRAPTOR had him first by a good margin, and Rudy’s made it known he does pay attention to those.   I understand why he didn’t win but it wouldn’t be crazy for him to feel slighted. If anything he should probably have been upset about finishing behind AD when the whole reason AD was second was due to the Lakers team D, with the Lakers with Davis on had basically the same Drating as the Jazz with Gobert on."

Yep eye test is still needed as is context. Otherwise rudy gobert is like a top 35 player of all time according to some stats lmao.
Lmao Giannis and Middleton at [60 overall](https://hoopshype.com/nba2k/milwaukee_bucks/2013-2014/)  Rudy Gobert rated lower than I thought possible [at 52](https://hoopshype.com/nba2k/utah_jazz/2013-2014/)  Draymond also being slept on [at 61](https://hoopshype.com/nba2k/golden_state_warriors/2013-2014/)
"Asserting that they're dominating the game is already deliberately pushing in not only nationalistic stuff but emotion-based claims that are annoying. I'm a Nets fan, one of our only retired jerseys is Drazen Petrovic, who was a huge star on our franchise and died young, and also happened to be European. There was no ""OMG a European is killing those Americans on the court"" because that would imply that it's an odd situation for a European person to be good at basketball. Just appreciation of an individual who was a great basketball player. It is possible that not speaking the same language creates some barriers between people, but what they do on the court doesn't need language either, and we can appreciate them either way.  I hope the same can be done now. Rudy Gobert is his own issue because he was going around catching Covid and touching microphones, but Giannis's greatness as a player just shows that nation, like race or other factors you're born with, doesn't define who you are or can be. Rather than making it more about that."
"Defensive specialists like PJ Tucker, Draymond Green, and Rudy Gobert aren’t exactly getting wiped off the floor. DeAndre Ayton, Julius Randle, and Giannis are all big men who don’t shoot much from outside. They are all doing pretty ok."
"Giannis and harden, and maybe rudy gobert/ben simmons are the only times i can think of where they dont go ""hes a great player, etc etc"" whenever another player is brought up by a reporter"
"Yeah, noted shooter Rudy Gobert really sets the tone for having to be able to shoot in today’s game."
"Rudy Gobert is going to be a hof, just because of those DPOYs awards"
"We got Big Body and Jakob ""80% of Rudy Gobert for 20% of the price"" Poeltl in that trade babyyyyyy"
"You mean Rudy ""Licking the Microphone"" Gobert?"
"I think the problem with Favors isn't that he's super cooked or washed, it's just that he played a lot of minutes versus starters with a not super stellar defensive supporting cast, but was asked to do the thing that Rudy Gobert usually does which is to just defend the team 1v5 from the rim. That's a tough ask for a guy who's older, shorter, and also is just much worse defensively than one of the ten or fifteen best defenders of all time."
it was rudy gobert who was the lowest rated
"the lowest rated player on 2k that year was rudy gobert, but yeah 2k14 had giannis, middleton and draymond green very low ratings wise"
True. We also know that John Stockton blocked more shots than Rudy Gobert at least this year
Rudy Gobert
"Yup, to me it's not about being international as opposed to the limitations of his offensive game. Luka, Manu, guys like that get the respect because of how they play.  This is kind of reductive, but players tend to respect people like Jamal Crawford and Kyrie Irving, who have a deep bag and can score at all levels.   And compared to guys like Kawhi, LeBron and KD, Giannis is just seen as an athletic freak rather than someone with refined skillset because of his poor shooting. But in reality he can handle the ball and pass really well for his size. If we think of him as a center rather than a small forward, his skill level starts to look more polished compared to say, Rudy Gobert."
Rudy Gobert.
I have never met someone in real life who got excited over Rudy Gobert highlights. I wonder how many Gobert fans there are out there outside Utah
You can tell if someone only talks basketball on reddit. Like no one outside of reddit rates players like Rudy Gobert
fr bro. Advanced stats are the only reason Rudy Gobert gets into All star games n gets dpoys. Statsexuals are the downfall of the nba
Gobert is a biracial Frenchman. Giannis is the Greek son of Nigerian immigrants. I don't think they'd agree with your assessment. Giannis probably feels more kinship with some of the West African guys than someone like Rudy.
"I hope GIannis doesn't have covid but if it turns out he does, will this be his ""flu game"" or will he get blasted like Rudy GObert"
Head Coach: Mike Budenholzer  PG: Eric Bledsoe  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Harrison Barnes  PF: Julius Randle  C: Rudy Gobert
&gt;imagine thinking kareem is an all time defender in 2021 lol  Like you've even watched enough film to say this. You used him not winning a DPOY to prove your dumbass point that he wasn't an all-time great defender. Rudy Gobert has 3 of them for fuck's sake.
"Am I comparing the loss of defensive impact from starting Andre Iguodala to starting Kevon Looney to on the other side the Rockets going from Chris Paul at point guard to James Harden at point guard? Yeah, I think that's in the ballpark of fair.  The Rockets were -63 in that series. This idea that the Rockets ""solved"" the Warriors needs to die. They eeked out a couple of close wins after Iguodala went down because there was someone on the floor the Rockets could abuse hard enough on offense. It's really hard for bigs to be relevant for the right reasons facing a perimeter centric offense. Just ask Rudy Gobert.  The harsh truth of that series was it was the absolute closest that those Rockets could have played that Warriors team. You can simulate that series game 1 to game 7 20 times and the Rockets maybe win 1"
"Better than Holmgren, Bates, and Duren and Banchero. He averaged 5.7 blocks during the U19 championships. He’s a dynamic offensive and defensive weapon. Imagine a more mobile Porzingis on offense with added passing skills, and Rudy Gobert with more length on defense."
"How fans let mob reactions ruin a player’s perception. For example, people were making the “playing in China next year” joke about Rudy Gobert after the Clippers-Jazz series, ignoring the fact that he wasn’t even the real reason for their L and, you know, he’s a 3x DPOY!"
"Some pretty good takes  &gt; Raptors don't do a complete rebuild from year three, but they do a retool and successfully pull off a trade for a super star.  &gt; Jerry West successfully gets the Clippers to the Western Conference finals.   &gt; Paul George left OKC.  &gt; The Timberwolves and Suns are the two favorites in the West.   Well that was half right.  &gt; The Nets are a major contender in year four and five of this timeline.  &gt; Clippers make the WCF without CP3  &gt; Rudy Gobert wins 3 DPOYs  But also some really bad takes....  &gt; Embiid isn't a starter, always injured.  &gt; Seattle has an NBA basketball team again.   &gt; The best rookie will be Josh Jackson.  &gt; Wolves win a title  &gt; lonzo considered top 10 player in league."
"Rudy Gobert, a lot of defenders for a glorified shot blocker who is constantly exposed and played around in the playoffs.   Jazz fans will be around to downvote and say he’s the best player on the team shortly."
Rudy Gobert maybe?  Or Facu Campazzo suddenly becomes the star in the NBA that he was in Europe now he can get frisky on defence again
"Where has the ""Rudy Gobert is the best defender"" brigade gone? Funny they all seem to pop up in the regular season then disappear when the playoffs start"
"ehhhh I'd consider draft day trades as being drafted by who you  end up with.  Unless you want to say Luka was drafted by the Hawks, and Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert were both drafted by Denver, etc"
"Rudy Gobert or Giannis Antetokounmpo in the regular season, Anthony Davis / Draymond Green / Giannis in the postseason"
"The team needs size, rim protector.  Someone who will actually knock the ball off the rim, sets screens, rim runs.  Basically an American Rudy Gobert."
bradley “rudy gobert” beal
Anybody seen Rudy Gobert? He's the one who spread it all over the microphone last time and almost killed everyone and it ended up costing him like $1m lol
“Rudy Gobert is a top 10 player in the NBA” was a popular take by Jazz fans at one point   Ex:https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eow47o/currently_rudy_gobert_is_a_top_10_player_in_the/
"All-hated team should also have: Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Rudy Gobert, Grayson Allen, Ben Simmons, Andre Drummond, Jae Crowder, Kyle Kuzma  All-loved team should have: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Derrick Rose, Alex Caruso, Jarrett Allen, Boban Marjanovic"
"Rudy Gobert has been doing this for 5 years now. He'll make at least 7 of those 10 shots and will provide everything else a team needs in rebounding, defense and effective screens. Impact wise, I'm not sure there is any player that can do more. A younger Draymond Green would have a strong case as well."
"KD, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Draymond, LeBron, Rudy Gobert"
All time? Bill Russell.  In today's game? Rudy Gobert or Draymond Green.
"Draymond, Ben Simmons, Rudy Gobert"
Rudy Gobert could definitely face guard Durant for 50 minutes and hold him under 10.   The only way he couldn’t would be cuz Quinn Snyder’s system was holding him back
rudy gobert gonna start retweeting him
Wouldn’t a shorter 3 point line mean someone like Rudy Gobert could guard the paint and still be able to close out on his man if he’s around the 3 point line?
How many (straight) girls are we in this subs ? For having this discussion with my girl friends (because thats the only way they get interested in basketball) most common answers are :  - pretty boy Oubre JR - Serge Ibaka - Ben Simmons - Devin Booker - Jordan Clarkson - Rudy Gobert (that's the french pride) - Kevin Love -  Danilo Gallinari - JJ redick - Dlo - Dame - Beal  But big big hype on boys like Simmons Oubre and Booker they ar every popular (among my friends and women talk on the internet).
Rudy Gobert Goaltend
"Ahh so since scoring is the most important, then the best scores must be picked for the all stars every year because it’s so important right?   Who was it who has been an all star 3 times and who was it who’s never been an all star? 🤔🤔  Rudy Gobert must be a great scorer then if he’s an all star since scoring is so important right? 🤔  Stop showing your ignorance of the sport lmao. The 3x all star, 1 team all defensive point guard on a 1 seed is better then the 0 time all star, not great defender on a 12 seed. It’s not hard.   They don’t just hand out all stars you gotta earn that, something fox hasn’t done yet while Simmons has done it 3 times in a row at the same position. Unless you think you know more than the professional voters 😂"
"My under the radar ones...  Rondo and Wade on the Bulls, with the IG post ""My vets would never go to the media"" talking about Jimmy Butler... never understood the logic there  Lebron passive aggressive tweets, the Kevin Love saga was amazing, we all literally argued over the meaning of an Arthur fist meme for months.  Giannis discovering what a ""Smothie"" is  Giannis' blowjob bell  Paul Pierce vs IT retirement night fiasco. The pettiness was hillarious.   Kobe's 60 on 50 shots in his final game.   Rudy Gobert trying to spread coronavirus to people.   The Demarcus Cousins traded during the all star game thing"
"all that is very speculative, I dont buy this argument that capela is holding collins back in any meaningful way.  ""clogs the interior""?    they can obviously coexist just fine on the floor, they went to the ECF this year.    why would any other center be less prone to ""clogging the interior"" than capela is?   do you want to run collins at center?  mavs have problems with interior defense since KP wasn't very good at protecting the rim.  collins did a good job defensively but how much of that was capela doing a credible rudy gobert impression with his paint protection"
This is not the question but take Giannis out of the Bucks and add Rudy Gobert and you just might have the least watchable team in league history.
Yeah only arguable ones I see are    Rudy Gobert vs Donovan Mitchell   Myles Turner vs Domantas Sabonis   Pascal Siakam vs Kyle Lowry   Gordon Hayward vs LaMelo Ball
"he's an all star talent, albeit very flawed  RUDY GOBERT ALERT."
"Correct, it’s how Rudy Gobert absolutely **dominates** international play, even to a degree that he doesn’t in the NBA."
France- Rudy gobert  Argentina - Facundo Campazzo  Japan - Rui Hachimura  Ausie - patty Mills  Italy - Danilo Gallinari  Spain - gasol brothers    I just named 1 player for most of the team. Iran don't have a nba player so we can expect them to get blown out.
Kevin Love is strictly for when they play France cause of Rudy Gobert
"Team 1: Choose death  Team 2: They all hate each other and will never pass the ball to each other  Team 3: Jimmy Butler is going to have sex with all their girlfriends and it will be a PROBLEM.  Team 4: a great team until their point guard decides he'd be better off spending his time fighting for the rights of obscure causes, and until the second round when Rudy Gobert turns into a golem  Team 5: My pick for second best of these 5, some really streaky shooting"
"A random hawks-wizards game in march 2020 to see trae vs beal, trae magically missed the game with the flu, then the rudy gobert covid ordeal happened like the next week."
I mean Rudy Gobert might end up in the Hall of Fame too
Rudy Gobert has left the chat
"The crazy thing about Robert Williams aside from being an advanced stats darling, or his stellar passing especially throwing lobs to others, ability to change the trajectory of almost anyone's shot, and change the time continuum. He's consistently one of the best shot blockers in the game.  He's ranked 9th in the league with 91 blocks per game.  This was something I'm always in awe of, because I was looking at his statistics on BBall-Reference two days ago, and he's ahead of players like Embiid, Giannis, and Jarrett Allen. All players well known for their defensive capabilities/weakside or shot blocking help.  And he's done this in 985 minutes.  |1. Rudy Gobert|2187 MPG|190 blocks| |:-|:-|:-| |2. Myles Turner|1455 MPG|159 blocks| |3. Nerlens Noel|1547 MPG|141 blocks| |4. Clint Capela|1898 MPG|129 blocks| |5. Jakob Poeltl|1845 MPG|123 blocks| |6. Chris Boucher|1453 MPG|111 blocks| |7.

Joel Embiid|1585 MPG|69 Blocks|  What a freakin' beast. If the dude could just stay healthy, he makes us that much better as a team for real."
Rudy Gobert isn't averaging damn near 30 points and 6 assists every season now is he?
Because Rudy Gobert takes 8 shots per game (mostly open dunks and putbacks) compared to 21 from Giannis.

There’s a guy who looks like a white Rudy Gobert in my local commercials but idk where to post it
Ben Wallace was a way more dominant player than Rudy Gobert. I don’t think he really deserved HOF induction either but his case is far better than Gobert’s
Well you can live in your fantasy world where Rudy Gobert gets into the HOF. He won’t. You’re making the case for him because it helps your shitty argument. Few people in this sub and likely fewer people in the HOF committee will look at Gobert’s career and see a HOFer
It doesn’t. See Rudy Gobert
"He carried Argentina to the finals of the world cup two years ago, dropping 28 and 13 against Rudy Gobert in the semi final. Dude is a legend, last one of the golden generation, still carrying the torch."
Is Rudy Gobert a superstar?
"&gt;a great bargain for a player who, let's be real, posted the same exact stat-line as Rudy Gobert last season prior to joining the Lakers  That should tell you that looking at the stat-line is a terrible way of evaluating these two players."
There was an Athletic article making the case that the sole reason KLove is on this team is defense against Rudy Gobert or something like that.
fr outside of Luka the 2nd best player at the Olympics is Rudy Gobert💀💀. They should never lose to these teams.
Rudy Gobert is a huge One Piece fan. He was interviewed about it on the Crunchyroll website.
"It really just depends on the context. Shaq would probably be benched if their opponent had a stretch 5 in the modern era. Rudy Gobert won DPOY this year and then literally got benched in some of the post season because he can't keep up with small centers. It doesn't mean he's worse than them by any means, just that he doesn't match up well against them. Their 3s are worth more than your 2s so you need to be benched.  Tim Duncan is the best PF ever but he might have some issues defending against modern day forwards that can hit 3s and run faster than him.   If Curry went against Magic, that would be a tough matchup. Curry is a way better scorer but Magic is much better on defense. Magic might be able to stop Curry sometimes but Curry is definitely not stopping Magic's giant body from backing him down. Curry's 3s are worth more than Magic's 2s so it would be close.    Of course having 5 of the top 10 or so players ever will be mostly unstoppable but the context changes a lot. In the modern era, I would prefer to have more positionless players that won't be a major liability on defense if they get switched onto.  Something like:  Magic  Michael Jordan  Lebron  Durant  Giannis"
"His rep is as one of the most arrogant assholes in all of sports. That happens when you anoint yourself ""Playoff P"" and then continue to double and triple down in subsequent years.  Nothing more people love than to see that guy fail. Lebron was basically Kim Jong Un after the decision. Rudy Gobert was one of the most talented, likeable guys in the NBA before that covid shit. Now he's a bum and no one likes him lol.  Meanwhile Giannis could miss 100 straight clutch free throws and no one would bbq him. Character plays into perception."
Lol you don’t turn someone as good as Shaq into Rudy gobert.
"A lot of people remember DJ as this Rudy Gobert type all star defender, it's weird man. As a Clippers fan who watched every single game since his rookie season, I can tell you he improved astronomically from where he was, but DJ was never as good as it seemed he was. So many times he would get lost on switches, he would leap past defenders if they pumped faked, he would get into foul trouble, and his strength was kind of lackluster for such a big dude. He would also get absolutely abused by better big men all the time. It was so frustrating hearing people call him the best rim protector in the league when as a fan, you were pulling your hair out going ""c'mon DJ"" more than you were praising him during games. So basically, I'll take Ayton now over DJ on his best night, because he just does so much more, is more consistent and while his defense isn't as flashy, I find it's a ton more disciplined and effective."
" Booker is definitely top 20 but out of Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gobert, and Chris Paul, is Booker definitely ahead of 7 of these players?"
Ayton. Jordan is a lesser Rudy Gobert.
Surprised to see Gobert over spida comments. Was disappointed he was so hobbled in the playoffs. He’s so good. And a super clutch performer. Fuck Rudy
"On less efficiency and higher turnover percentage. Since the average nba possession is worth about 1.1 points, if you take the ball away then that takes 1.1 points away from your opponent and give 1.1 points to your team, also of you cut an opponents  TS% percentage by 6% the. You are basically lowering that 1.1 per possession to 1 so every possession your better defense basically earns your team 0.1 points. Over 20 possessions that is 2 point, and over an average NBA game that is 10 points.  Again this is all just based on averages and is just based on value above an average player but Iggy increasing Lebron's t/o by almost one a game and lowering his fg% by 6% over roughly 80 possessions is worth 8-12 points a game on defense alone, somebody adding an additional 8 points per game while taking away nothing offensively is a major achievement and will change the outcome of many games. This is why dudes like Rudy Gobert get max deals, not because they won't get embarrassed by a star but because that embarrassment will be lower and will be worth far more points than an average defensive player"
"Gobert was asked to do the impossible in that series and guard both the paint and the perimeter. He can't be in two places at once and no one else on the team stepped up to help him.  He's not the primary reason the Jazz lost that series. It was being outcoached, the lack of defense from anyone not named Rudy or Royce, and not having a proper point guard to run the offense."
Rudy Gobert doesn’t attempt 3’s. Lu is better
"Yes - Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Jokic, Kyrie   Yes, but he shouldn’t - Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin  No - Paul George, Kevin Love, Rudy Gobert, Andre Iguodala  Absolutely not - Kemba Walker"
"I was sooo pissed I don't watch this live. I had a feeling Terence Mann was gonna go off one of the next few games. I saw the Jazz have a huge lead by halftime, said to myself ""Okay it's getting late I'll stay up for game 7 though"" and turned off the TV.   Wake up next morning to check the box score, Terence Mann has 39 points, and apparently along with Paul George, Reggie Jackson, and Patrick Beverley they 3-pt barraged the Clippers to victory and abused Rudy Gobert"
Someone should make this into a “YOU JUST LOST TO RUDY GOBERT” meme
Lowry - No  Lillard - Yes  Carmelo - Yes  Derrick Rose - No  Paul George - Probably   Kyrie - Yes  Kevin Love - No  Rudy Gobert - Maybe  Andre Iguodala - No
Best defender in the world is Rudy Gobert!
Rudy Gobert took that personally
"The easy answer to this question is ""Wilt Chamberlain.""   He once averaged 50.4 ppg for a season. He averaged 27 rpg in a season... twice. He averaged just under 23 rpg *for his career*. He scored 100 points in a game. He grabbed 55 rebounds in a game. He averaged 48.5 mpg in a season. (Read that again. Yes, he once averaged 48.5 minutes per game for an entire season, in a sport where a full-length regulation game is 48 minutes.) The list goes on and on. Many of his records aren't getting broken, ever.  But if you're looking for a non-Wilt answer, I would offer the following:  - Stockton's career assists and steals numbers. He's not just #1, he's #1 by a mile.  - Rasheed Wallace getting 41 technical fouls in a season. Since the mid-2000s the NBA instituted a rule where a player would get suspended a game after accumulating 16 technicals, and a subsequent suspension for every 2 technicals after that (I think). With these rules, Sheed's record is technically possible, but *very* unlikely.  - Mark Eaton averaging 5.6 blocks per game in a season. For reference, Rudy Gobert is obviously a good shot blocker, and the reigning DPOY. He averaged 2.7 bpg this season. If he came out next season and literally *doubled* his blocks, he would still fall short of Eaton's record."
Rudy gobert = overrated
"[""Remember when statmuse used to tweet cool stats and now they just slander Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert like the rest of NBA Twitter? Sad. Expected more""](https://twitter.com/rudygobert27/status/1409648394805547013)"
Rudy Gobert paid for my meal at Vegas. It was a fucking expensive meal too and I just said hi and complemented him. Was the year before he won dpoy
"John gobert still isn’t elite at scoring. Rudy becoming an elite shooter still doesn’t make him an elite scorer, but his play making alone would make him really valuable on offense."
"It's nearly ten years since his MVP season, we only really remember the highlights. Like Rudy Gobert dunks all the time but he doesn't have that many highlights. Pretty much every Rose dunk was a highlight"
Rudy Gobert vibes.  *hides*
Rudy gobert
Rudy Gobert is overrated and over paid
John Stockton  Klay Thompson  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Tim Duncan  Rudy Gobert
"I was thinking about this and a few big Europeans always seem to be very loyal to their teams. Tony Parker, Rudy Gobert, Marc Gasol spent 11 years in Memphis, Dirk, Jokic said he wanted to be like Tim Duncan for Denver in terms of loyalty, and Luka signing that 5 year deal. Even in general a lot of European starters spend at least 5+ years on a team before getting traded or opting in to free agency."
"I think there is enough similarities between Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert to make a comparison. Both are premier defensive players, with very clear limitations regarding their offense and are seen as all-star level players, but what their actual value is has been quite controversial."
"I’m torn between John Malone, Karl Gobert or Rudy Stockton. I think Rudy Stockton would be damn near close to a perfect player though. Basically Jokic on offense with better passing and pull-up game and Rudy is now probably the best player ever at predicting passing lanes? That’s probably the best."
Just about every year they give the Jazz all their hard games early and their easy games late. Which evens out by the end of the year but it sucks when it comes to all star voting. Front loaded schedules 100% cost Rudy Gobert all star bids in 2018 and 2019. Tbh I haven’t looked at how frontloaded or not our schedule this year is.
definitive answer:   ||PLAYER|TEAM|AGE|GP|BLK| --:|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:| |1|Myles Turner|IND|25|47|3.4| |2|Rudy Gobert|UTA|29|71|2.7| |3|Nerlens Noel|NYK|27|64|2.2| |4|Clint Capela|ATL|27|63|2| |5|Chris Boucher|TOR|28|60|1.9| |6|Jakob Poeltl|SAS|25|69|1.8| |7|Robert Williams III|BOS|23|52|1.8| |8|Anthony Davis|LAL|28|36|1.6| |9|Jaren Jackson Jr.|MEM|21|11|1.6| |10|Richaun Holmes|SAC|27|61|1.6| |11|Brook Lopez|MIL|33|70|1.5| |12|Mitchell Robinson|NYK|23|31|1.5| |13|Jarrett Allen|CLE|23|63|1.4| |14|Daniel Gafford|WAS|22|54|1.4| |15|Joel Embiid|PHI|27|51|1.4| |16|Kristaps Porzingis|DAL|25|43|1.3| |17|Goga Bitadze|IND|21|45|1.3| |18|Kevin Durant|BKN|32|35|1.3| |19|Hassan Whiteside|SAC|32|36|1.3| |20|Isaiah Stewart|DET|20|68|1.3| |21|Mo Bamba|ORL|23|46|1.3|
"Purely shot blockers:   Myles Turner, Mitchell Robinson, Nerlens Noel, Chris Boucher, Rudy Gobert, Kristaps Porziņģis, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capella all come to mind. All of them are great at block shots eplicitly. But not all of them are elite level interior defenders &amp; rim protectors.   Best rim protectors/interior defenders is a similar list, but it excludes players who are great at getting blocks but not doing much else defensively. That list for me would be:   Rudy Gobert, Clint Capella, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, Bam Adebayo etc..."
"Tangential since you mentioned it, but who are the top five shotblockers in the league currently?    Myles Turner   Mitchell Robinson   Giannis Antetekoumpo   Anthony Davis   Rudy Gobert   Joel Embiid   Clint Capela   Robert Williams   Deandre Ayton   Bam Adebayo"
"Tbf I don’t think it *required* the best 3pt shooting team in the league to expose them. That’s a strategy that a lot of teams have used successfully, the Clips are just the most recent obvious example.   To be clear, I’m a big fan of Rudy, but let’s not pretend he can’t be game-planned around.  Edit: to let my bias show, I would’ve happily welcomed a series against the Jazz and watched Gobert run around the arc chasing KP or DFS."
Thanasis has more followers than:  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  James Harden  Kawhi Leonard  Rudy Gobert  Who's the GOAT now?
"everyone u named is ahead of him, but not tatum (yet), Gobert (and I love rudy), or KAT, and Kyrie is above mitchell beal book. Also, despite his poor playoffs, I'd have butler over kyrie, and in fact butler is in that 12-15 range as well."
"Sure, but are you *really* going to say that ankle was the main reason you lost the series when all of the following happened **post-Kawhi injury**? (Keep in mind that I haven’t even included Conley’s horrid game 6 because he, too, was returning from injury.)   #**Game 5 :**   Marcus Morris Sr. : 25 pts, 10/16 shooting (3/4 from 3)  Reggie Jackson : 22 pts, 8/15 shooting (3/8 from 3)   Jordan Clarkson (second half) : 1 pt, 0/6 shooting (0/4 from 3)  Royce O’Neale (second half) : 4 pts, 1/7 shooting (0/5 from 3), 4 PF, -14 in 20:14  Utah Jazz (second half, Mitchell’s stats not included) : 10/29 from the field (34.5%), 2/15 from 3 (13.3%)  Utah Jazz (second half, Mitchell’s stats included) : 13/43 from the field (30.2%), 3/24 from 3 (12.5%)  Utah Jazz (full game, Mitchell’s stats not included) : 14/21 from the FT line (66.7%), 10 AST, 12 TO (AST:TO = 0.83), 18 pts off TO  Utah Jazz (full game, Mitchell’s stats included) : 19/27 from the FT line (70.4%), 15 AST, 14 TO (AST:TO = 1.07), 20 pts off TO   #**Game 6 :**   Terance Mann (second career playoff start) : 39 pts, 15/21 shooting (7/10 from 3)  Reggie Jackson : 27 pts, 10/16 shooting (3/7 from 3), 3 stl  Los Angeles Clippers (second half) : 30/42 from the field (71.4%), 14/19 from 3 (73.7%)   Rudy Gobert (second half) : 6 pts, 2/2 shooting (0/0 from 3), 6 reb, 3 PF, 2 TO, -34 in 24:00  Rudy Gobert (full game) : 12 pts, 5/6 shooting (0/0 from 3), 10 reb, 2 stl, 5 PF, 3 TO, -24 in 42:08  Jordan Clarkson (second half) : 0 pts, 0/4 shooting (0/3 from 3), -25 in 10:42  Joe Ingles (3rd quarter) - 0 pts, 0/2 shooting (0/2 from 3), 2 AST, -17 in 06:18  Utah Jazz (second half, Mitchell’s stats not included) : 11/26 from the field (42.3%), 5/17 from 3 (29.4%), 5 AST, 10 TO (AST:TO = 0.5)  Utah Jazz (second half, Mitchell’s stats included) : 15/39 from the field (38.5%), 9/25 from 3 (36.0%), 10 AST, 11 TO (AST:TO = 0.91)  Utah Jazz (full game, Mitchell’s stats not included) : 27 pts conceded off TO, 8/10 from the FT line (80%), 10 AST, 14 TO (AST:TO = 0.71)  Utah Jazz (full game, Mitchell’s stats included) 29 pts conceded off TO, 14/19 from the FT line (73.7%), 19 AST, 16 TO (AST:TO = 1.19)  Biggest lead : Utah Jazz (25, 11:36 left in 3Q)   Given all of that, are you really still gonna sit here and say that the main reason you lost the series was because of an ankle injury to a guy who **averaged 30/7/7 over the last 2 games anyway**? Y’all didn’t lose because of that - **y’all lost because the team played like shit**."
Rudy Gobert would be the modern center equivalent. Guards have been so scoring dominant lately it’s tough.  Rajon Rondo is 4 time all defense and a steals champ. Not sure what his Vegas odds are on HOF.
"Lmao Rudy Gobert gets beaten by Jokic too. Should I post a clip of that and claim Rudy can't guard the 5 either? There's clips of LeBron stopping your average 5 player all the time, ofc MVP caliber players can score against LeBron, hell any MVP level position can do that."
Rudy Gobert with Steph's full offensive capability
"he was pretty awful, and it's about the opportunity cost.  The Clippers drafted Olowokandi over 3 no-doubt-about-it first ballot HoFers who are in the top 20 all time in scoring, and two of which are Finals MVPs (plus Dirk won regular season MVP in 2007).  You can say that the Cavs took Bennett instead of Giannis, which hurts, but the rest of that class was pretty weak.  2013 was a draft class without a consensus number 1 pick, whereas in 1998 Vince, Jamison, Paul Pierce &amp; Bibby were tearing it up at major NCAA schools &amp; had tons of visibility while Olowokandi was 23 when he got drafted &amp; went to University of the Pacific.  Call Giannis &amp; Dirk a wash as far as draft misses if you like, but the opportunity cost of not getting Vince or Paul Pierce vs. a CJ McCollum or Rudy Gobert is way worse to me."
"I would the say the Sixers because the way they got beat was just embarrassing. 2 blown double digit leads with one of the best defenses in the league is just embarrassing, but I think the Jazz has to be a really close 2nd. They had the best record in the NBA and the DPOY, Rudy Gobert. They were up 2-0, and they should’ve beat the Clippers easily especially with Kawhi out. Instead they got outschemed easily, lost 4 in a row, and lost Game 6 in such a terrible fashion with a 20+ lead loss against the Kawhi-less Clippers. (I don’t know why so many double digit leads were blown that week in the playoffs that was strange)."
Rudy Gobert suddenly developing a deadly 3 point shot.
"I would argue yes.  If you look at the top players in the game today, it’s clear that this is the era with the biggest variety in terms of style of play.    Today you have sharpshooting guards with elite playmaking in Curry, Dame, Harden, CP3, Trae Young etc.    But you also have big, physical wings who like to slash in Giannis and Lebron.  You have 3-level scorers who are elite from midrange in KD, Luka, and Kawhi.   You’ve got Jokic who is an elite low post scorer who can extend to the 3 and is an elite playmaker.    You’ve got Embiid who can shoot threes, but makes his money being absolutely game changing beneath the rim.    You’ve got Rudy Gobert who has never made a 3 in his career, but changes the game defensively.    And that’s not even touching on the next generation of players coming up all of whom are bringing new skill sets into the game.    This variety exists because the 3 pointer is so important today.  Why?  Because it’s so easy to get 3pt shooters in today’s game.  In the 2000’s, the game was entirely predicated on iso scoring wings and dominant low post players.  But that meant if you wanted to be a star, you had to be either an iso scoring wing (Kobe, TMac, DWade, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, hell even Lebron played as an iso scoring guard when he first came into the league) or a dominant low post player (Shaq, Yao Ming, Tim Duncan, Dwight Howard).  If you had any other skill set, you were a role player.  Are you an elite wing defender and playmaker?  Role player.  Are you a hyper efficient 3pt shooter?  Role player.  Are you a stretch big who can rebound, pass, handle the ball, and guard on the perimeter?  Well can you go against Shaq one-on-one 2ft from the basket?  No?  Role player.    Nowadays, if you come into the NBA with staf potential, regardless of skill set teams can build around you because the only requirement that a team needs to have offensive is good shooting, and you can get that from role players, you don’t need that from your stars.  So now stars can be whatever they are best at, and teams will fill in the rest of the team with 3&amp;D role players and be all set."
"Also a good point, but I wouldn't say Leonard has been ""coddled"" in any way. People were celebrating when he was kicked off the Heat.   Leonard apologized, and he's trying to make amends. I'm not who was attacked, so I don't really get to say whether or not he's forgivable.   Another example is Rudy Gobert - he made that dumb show of support with the media right before he tested positive for COVID. Nobody remembers why he touched the microphones, they just remember he did, and they ignore both that context as well as his attempts to make amends for that mistake and hold it against him that he was a jackass."
I always laugh when people said Lebron could guard 1-5. yeah he can guard soft bigs with no offensive skill like Roy Hibbert or Rudy Gobert but matchup against a true 5 with skill like Embiid or Jokic and it's BBQ chicken
"Rudy Gobert has 3 DPOY's. And?  AD is more of a game changer as a defender in the playoffs and is the best overall due to his ability to protect the rim, guard the perimeter &amp; play the P&amp;R a bit better than Giannis. His ability to completely shut down entire offenses led by stars (like the Rockets &amp; Heat in the 2020 playoffs) is insane.  Giannis is up there too, but I'd put AD and Draymond over him."
"and what's he done till then? never improve on defense ran jimmy out of town. still in purgatory.  Is he even a top5 center? Jokic  Embiid, Ayton, Bam, Rudy Gobert, all got cases against him.   Facts don't lie, keep loving your fortnite boii"

if NBA didn't give a rats ass then why is Giannis and Rudy Gobert on Xmas day
"6th,2nd,3rd, 5th,2nd 3rd, 10th,14th, DNP, 6th  Yeah…he’s pretty good. Rudy Gobert has also been top 3 in this stat for the last 5 years. Guess it’s not hard when the only times you shoot are when you drop the ball into the basket."
"Tony Parker has been in the league for nearly 20 years and won 4 NBA championships. So, that's experience and success that Rudy Gobert can't yet compete with."
"Tony Parker. Gobert has a lot of awards and may finish with more All-Stars and All-NBA than Tony. But basketball is a team sport and the goal is to win championships. People may say that Tony was never the driving force of the Spurs' trophies. But that is wrong for the last two. He was Finals MVP in 2007 and was the leader of the team in 2013 and 2014.   And there are other dimensions where TP surpasses Rudy. He led a dramatic change in the basketball culture in France and made the French national team a contender in ways we had never seen before. He was the clear leader of french basketball for 15 years. The French NT vocal leader is Fournier, not Gobert.   Things may change but unless Gobert wins a couple championships, Parker reigns"
"Remember when the narrative for Rudy Gobert and Mitchell was that their relationship was unrepairable because Gobert was careless to a virus that became a global pandemic, ending the lives of millions…Then they continued to play together.  Yeahhhh so I’m pretty sure some post game comments from embiid and doc aren’t this relationship killers y’all are acting like."
"He's very good defensively in the role he plays. I'm not convinced he brings enough to the table outside of that though to make them a real contender, and when you're paying someone that much money, I feel like they should be real difference makers. Like I said, I am not invested in the success or failure of the Jazz, but that is how I feel about Gobert. I mentioned this in another comment, but I think you could very well get 70 to 80% of what Rudy gives you for much, much less money which would free them up to build a better team around Mitchell who I think can certainly be the best or second best player on a championship team in his career."
"That's just it; I personally think you can find 80% of what Rudy brings to the table for far less money and then build a better team around that. There is no team in the NBA willing to part with a top 30 player for Rudy for that reason. I'm not sure the Jazz would get back even 50 cents on the dollar for him. I don't mean to rag on the guy, but I just don't think the Jazz do much outside of the regular season with Gobert playing such a prominent role and commanding so much money."
"It’s not really a problem when it’s your center, especially if they also create a bunch of space via screens and have roll gravity. It’s also just a weird thing people have with Rudy. I don’t think I’ve seen someone say Clint Capela is holding back the hawks offensively (or the rockets before that) and offensively Gobert is basically a significantly more efficient version of Capela."
Name one playoff series where Rudy gobert took over.    The warriors rockets and clippers all Eliminated the jazz by targeting gobert and torching him.   Meanwhile I can’t find one playoff series you can point to sand say gobert won them that round.   However with Parker... he’s the main reason a lot of teams have been eliminated.
Rudy gobert is no James harden or Hakeem and Parker was no role player.
Victor Wembanyama is well on his way there. Up to this point he’s had the best career so far. Still will be probably a decade before he surpasses Rudy in terms of accolades but it terms of pure basketball ability he could surpass Gobert in five years.
Not even close. Tony Parker was a problem in his prime. Rudy Gobert is getting torched by Mann and has no offensive bag outside of catching lobs. Rudy Gobert himself would tell you Tony Parker is much better. The only French player who has a chance of passing TP is Victor Wembyanama or smth
Tony Parker is better than Rudy gobert
James Haren  Patient Zero (Rudy Gobert)  PG13% in his peak “playoff P” bum times
"Rudy Gobert was the best player on the best team with better advanced stats than anyone besides Jokic last year and yet he finished behind multiple Knicks. Awards voting in the NBA has always been weird because there’s too many games for any voter to watch all or even most of them, which leads awards voting to be highly prone to narrative, moreso than in other sports.   Also it’s not surprising that nobody voted Kobe for MVP when he played on a 34 win team and had just completely shat the bed in the previous finals."
"I'm going to go slightly against the grain and take Rudy Gobert over Tony Parker.   Rudy Gobert has already won 3 DPOY awards, and has 5 defensive team selections and 4 All-NBA selections, and he's still right in his prime so it would be expected that he would add to that.   Parker was a great player, but I'm not going to give him credit in a comparison for winning all those rings when he played essentially his entire career next to Tim Duncan. His finals MVP in 2007 is certainly noteworthy, but I don't think it outweighs the fact that Gobert is on 3 DPOYs and counting."
Depends on the team composition. I doubt the nets would need another scorer more than a Rudy gobert.
"It’s obviously Rudy vs Parker, and I guess it comes down to what you value. Here’s their personal accolades:   Parker: 6x All-star, 4x All-NBA, 1x FMVP  Gobert: 2x all star, 4x All-NBA, 3x DPOY, 5x 1st team all defense   Parker also has 4 titles, but he wasn’t the best player for any of them so that’s a matter of opinion how much those should matter. Rudy also has 2 of the most egregious all star snubs ever in 18 and 19 and just turned 29. Parker for the moment is probably the most accomplished but TP never reached the level that Rudy’s at right now."
They really gave RUDY GOBERT a Christmas game over Joel and jokic….
"Just curious, why? Utah have built their entire system around Gobert and sacrificed perimeter defense for pure shooters and a motion-pass heavy offense.  Nobody else in the league can do what he does in that specific role where he can cover for everyone else defensively. And even then it can be exploited like we saw in the Clippers series when they apply too much pressure to the zone with 5 capable off-the-dribble 3 point shooters.  They would need a complete rebuild if Gobert is traded which is highly unlikely as they just signed both Rudy and Don to max extensions."
"If you're actually interested, I would recommend watching his minutes from the last 2-3 months of the season. He didn't really have an issue with fouling outside a couple of games. He also showcased the basketball IQ to diagnose where the defense was breaking down quick enough to cut off options for the offense. This doesn't necessarily show up on the stat sheet, but is very important to a defense. And also, it's not like I'm saying he's Rudy Gobert or anything. I'm saying he finished the season as one of the best defenders on a team with mostly poor defenders."
"how is that even a debate  rudy has time to close the (huge) gap that exists right now but there's no debate at the moment  the disrespect to tony bruh, 100% sure gobert himself would pick tony and as a french guy one of the point that i'd like to emphasize (even tho idk if it counts lol) is how much tony did for the french national team  he ALWAYS was there even tho it was very uncommon for bonafide stars and really is the reason you see batum and now fournier and gobert in the EDF every tourney, you're french you're playing international basketball anytime you can and he really paved the way for that"
"I think there's a chance that they make the playoffs without Mitchell because his skillset is easier for our roster to replicate, and the Jazz had a very good record last year in games that Mitchell didn't play. However, the Jazz have been abominable for years in the minutes that Gobert doesn't play.   Rudy raises our floor. Donovan raises our ceiling. We need both. It's the auxiliary pieces around them that can be moved."
name 1 year you think he was anywhere close to top 10 and i'll name you 20 players better than him this year  jfc i'm french and biased for both tony and rudy but that's madness gobert never sniffed top10
"I just feel bad for Favors.  &gt;Originally started as a ""4"" next to Gobert making like 17M a year but basically got all of his time as a backup behind Rudy for 48 minutes of rim protection  &gt;Utah realizes that they can't have 2 non-shooting bigs in the lineup and dump Favors to New Orleans  &gt;Favors COMES BACK to Utah on a reduced contract to be Gobert's certified backup big. No starting lineup anymore.  &gt;Utah says, ""Fuck it, we need more perimeter D instead of rim protection"" and ship Favors off AGAIN. They then decide they can get backup minutes on the cheap by signing Whiteside for a vet-min and getting Eric Paschall for a 2nd rounder.  Favors showed a ton of loyalty and got shafted twice as a result."
&gt;I watched the Jazz all season. Bojan held his own all year. Their system was designed for guys to go inside because they knew they had Gobert as a help defender. You probably needed to watch more pal   It's only designed like that because nobody on their team outside of Niang and Rudy is a good defender. Its a reason they fell apart in the playoffs once the Clippers went 5 out and Rudy couldn't guard both the rim and the perimeter.
"Issue with this i see is who do you poll?  Say you poll team USA, solely comprised of stars (and Keldon Johnson). Then you are only getting the perspective of stars and guys that *usually* get the calls.  Of course they aren't going to like FIBA officiating, they got less calls.    You could also poll guys like Joe Ingles, Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier since they are quite familiar with the FIBA officiating.  But then you have the opposite problem - you're polling guys that very likely benefit from the differing rule set. I don't see those three foul baiting often if at all and their opponents (the stars) suffered from the rules.   I would be surprised if they didn't like it more.    Then you have the fact that less than 80 percent of the NBA (rough guess) would not be included in this poll, and very likely would be unable because they have not experienced or played under a FIBA rule set.    So I dont see a good way to have an accurate poll."
"Rudy Gobert has 3 DPOYs, has never played for a team as good as the teams Parker usually played with in San Antonio (other than the Jazz this year), and is on track to be a hall of famer"
Currently Parker but Gobert will probably be at the end of his career.   There individual awards are close now and Rudy is only 28.
I mean it's the same as with Ben Simmons. Their recent lack of playoff success is influencing everyone's opinion. Rudy is a very good player but he can't carry a team where he's the only positive defender.  Tony Parker also had the luxury of playing for Pop and with multiple HOFers unlike Gobert so you know.
"&gt;Andre Drummond  Going to have to respectfully disagree on that one, though it's a common refrain.   If anything, I always thought Andre was super fortunate to be playing in today's NBA, where the paint is emptier than it's ever been and where teams play spread small ball, allowing him some of the most unobstructed rebounding lanes in post-merger history.   Moreover, in the age of the spread pick-and-roll, that dude's been able to average over 16 points per game despite having one of the worst offensive skills sets I've ever seen out of an all-star center... ever. Guy just gets to feast one point blank alley-oops and tip-ins (often from on the aforementioned pick-and-roll).   Andre Drummond in the 1990's or prior is in trouble. Suddenly he's not just warding off Myles Turner for his rebounds, he's dealing with Antonio Davis &amp; Dale Davis, not to mention a rebound-hungry Otis Thorpe and Jerome Williams on his own side, all crammed into the paint at once, vying for that rock.   And without the prevalence of the spread pick-and-roll, I'm not really sure how that dude's scoring in the 90's or prior because no team in their right mind would give that dude more than a couple of post touches per game. And instead of running into a Rudy Gobert or Joel Embiid a few times a year, it's not hard to imagine Andre getting very lost among the shuffle of Shaq, David, Hakeem, Patrick, Rik, Rony, Vlade, and Dikembe."
"&gt; He played 38 mins a game that playoffs.  It was a wrist injury lol. That doesn't affect your cardio or ability to move.  &gt; You keep mentioning how Wall was better than Lowry  Of course he was. Because of the injury.  &gt; Oh no let’s do like you though and minimize it to just “1 ppg and 3 apg” as if any real objective basketball fan would use an argument so basic. Hey Our New PG Dennis Schröder only averaged 2 ppg and 3 apg less than Lowry last season guess there isn’t a huge jump in how good they are compared to each other lol.  You're the one minimizing it to just two stats. Lowry beats him by every advanced metric and was a significantly better defender. You're completely right that Lowry scoring just 2ppg and 3apg more than Schroeder doesn't show the whole picture, you have to look at *all* of the stats. Was Colin Sexton better than Chris Paul because he averaged more ppg this year? Oh and Jonas Valanciunas is better than Rudy Gobert. And don't forget that Jordan Clarkson is way better than Dejounte Murray.   Or do we need to look at more than just minimal differences in base box stats to evaluate a player?  Honestly at this point I'm not exactly sure if you understand how efficiency works. 1ppg is, quite literally, meaningless without looking at efficiency. But if that's your reason for Wall being better then you do you.  &gt; Wall was better in the regular season  So... Lowry leads him in every advanced stat and had Curry level efficiency and was one of the best floor spacers in the league... but Wall got 1 more ppg so he was way better lmao. Got it.  &gt; Would love to hear what you think Lowry could’ve been if he hadn’t been “hurt” throughout his prime though. Maybe a couple of 1st team all nbas? An MVP? Scoring titles? Surely in contention for goat right?  Lol come on now. Let's just have a mature debate about this without strawmanning. Personally I think Lowry had an argument for one more all nba third team in 2016 though, but it's debatable."
Ben Simmons?  Rudy Gobert?  Zach Lavine?  Blake Griffin(in DETROIT?) D'Angelo Russel? ANDRE DRUMMOND? John Wall?  Demarcus Cousins?  De'Andre Jordan?  Melo?  Isiah Thomas? Kevin Love? Demar Derozan? Lamarcus Aldridge?
"You could say that, yeah. But then again, our only other option at that time was Derrick Favors who is a worse perimeter defender than Gobert. Basically if a team decided to go Stretch 5 against us, we were fucked. That’s probably why our FO was so eager to sign Rudy Gay, who will probably just be playing at the 4 but could also be used as a “break in case of emergency” Center if teams go Stretch 5 on us."
"Rudy Gobert is useless in the playoffs. If you watch the jazz in the playoffs, it's pretty obvious that their perimeter defense falls apart in the playoffs and Gobert is constantly asked to guard 2 people at the same time."
"Before we start just naming players, let’s think about what kind of skillset we’re looking for. Since this team is made up of clones, both teams will be switching everything on defense, and there won’t really be any matchup hunting. Because of this, wouldn’t expect to see very many ball screens. Instead, I’d be looking for a versatile, switchable defender with a good handle, a good isolation scoring game, and solid spacing. Passing wouldn’t need to be elite, but the ability to make basic reads (drive and kick, find the open man, etc.) would be preferred, and obviously better passing is a bonus.   I don’t think he’s the WORST player (he’s very good) who would be able to do it but I would be fascinated to watch a team of 5 Scottie Pippens. Obviously the defense and passing are there, and although his career 3pt% is low, his 3pt volume and efficiency were both higher in the mid 90s and I think he could improve on his 3pt shooting if he were to devote as much time and effort to it as players do today.   People in this thread have mentioned Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Paul George, who could all work pretty well I think. As a Spurs fan, I’m hoping that Keldon Johnson can develop into the kind of player who would be able to do this, but he’s obviously young and still developing, so we don’t know what he’ll look like in 5 years. Also, at 6’5”, he might just be too small to defend bigger players, even with his famous “Big Body.”   P.S. Another interesting question is who’s the BEST player who WOULDN’T succeed on a team of clones of himself. I’d be looking for players who lack defensive versatility (Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Trae Young) or lack ball handling and isolation scoring ability (Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert). All of that said, it’s hard for me to say for sure that these clone teams wouldn’t still win, given the immense amount of talent present."
"I’d ask you, why did you not push back on Luka, but you pushed back on Trae? They’re almost equivalent players, save for Luka’s rebounding and Trae’s FT shooting. Trae will compete for the scoring title and assist title every year; which is Harden-esque. But the biggest difference between Luka and Trae is that Trae led his team to the Eastern Conference Finals this year. Trae is the #1 on that team (compared to Ayton as a #3). The point isn’t to be “on the finals team”. The point is to *lead* your team to the finals.  When looking at those 3 players *right now*, Ayton is well behind them. They are truly superstars. Doesn’t mean Ayton can’t be. But he’s averaging 14ppg after 3 years. There’s not many superstar bigs that were averaging 14ppg after 3 years. Rudy Gobert is the best comp I can think of. And he, too, is overshadowed by Luka and Trae."
"Lillard, john wall, rudy gobert, Ingram, and julius randle."
"Oh yes, Rudy Gobert over Giannis."
People will think Rudy Gobert was a french clothing brand in 15 years
"Gobert. Think about how many people bring up Mutombo or Wallace these days when talking about all time greats. Now imagine if they were both hated by most casual fans. Even though Rudy is one of the best defenders of this generation, he’ll barely get any attention in the future."
He would be basically Rudy Gobert or a Bam Adebayo type player in today’s league. Absolutely would be a stud.
Rudy Gobert is not an offensive liability
Well Rudy Gobert landed a pretty nice contract and is considered at least a pretty solid player.
"Rudy Gobert is a 3x DPOY and I can't think of many, if any, MVP he is better than."
(Rudy Gobert)
"Ben Wallace, Luol Deng, Joakim Noah, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert are all defence first players who were all stars with similar stats off the top of my head, not saying Simmons deserved his spot this year (Trae probably should’ve got in) but there’s definitely players who get into the all star game based off their defensive play  EDIT: Looking back on stats, Luol Deng did average 19 his second all star year though so maybe not the best example for my argument compared to the others"
Gobert will continue to be the best defender but he’s gonna face a massive uphill battle of voter fatigue. I feel pretty confident he’s gonna lead the league in DRAPTOR/DLEBRON/DRPM but lose DPOY to AD/Giannis. Rudy might need to win a chip for another DPOY or still be at this level in 3/4 years.
Most people see him as a top 15-20ish guy but I'm convinced that Rudy Gobert would make the Mavs contenders and a top 2 seed. He's shown that he can anchor a team with no All-Defence calibre teammates to the leagues best defence and he'd be a great lob threat next to Luka. His screening and vertical spacing could also make the Mavs more dynamic on offence.
"He was able to punish USA in the Olympics when he had a small switched on him.  Utah doesn't have anyone who can pass him the ball regularly.  Granted he should have been able to do better and it is a weakness of his, but there were several times where he was open or had his man pinned and he didn't get the ball.    The Jazz got exposed in the 5 out because Donovan was hurt and couldn't get by his defender.  If Donovan is healthy he gets to the basket at will against the 5 out.  On defense, no one could guard their man on the perimeter.  Rudy does great when getting switched on guards.  Statistics show he is one of the best perimeter defenders against guards in the league.  Problems with him getting switched on guards is the there in no one to guard the rim. When the team swings the ball, he has to leave his man to help out and then is forced to rotate back to the guard.  That is when he gets in trouble, but I don't know of a big in NBA history that could do that (maybe Draymond, but he is at least 6"" shorter than Gobert).  When you account for reach and wingspan, Rudy is basically the same length as Yao Ming."
Rudy Gobert. The Jazz win percentage is like 40% without him and 60% with him.
The problem is that Ingles is the only one of those ball handlers that’s actually good at getting Rudy the ball. Mitchell in particular is god awful at passing to Gobert. It’s so bad it makes sense to stagger them because of it.
nooo rudy gobert should be able to guard all 5 players at once or he should return his dpoys
"Rudy Gobert Nikola Vucevic until very recently, Jrue Holiday"
You probably think Rudy Gobert is overpaid too.
"No but there’s a reason Dirk Nowitzki has a ring and Dikembe Mutombo doesn’t. Same with Rudy Gobert being ringless (&amp; medal less) and Dwight Howard only winning one as a back up. Magic Johnson is considered the greatest point guard of all time even though he was a black hole on defense. Defense is greatly valued but not in primary roles. You don’t win championships with defensive stalwarts as your best player unless they are equally adept on offense (think KG/Duncan/Hakeem) or an elite two way wing (MJ, Kobe, Bron, Kawhi). You can get lucky and get a few stops with bad to mediocre defenders or they can turn up the intensity to get by. Poor scorers don’t get hot and all of a sudden carry offenses in the playoffs."
Jakob Poeltl. Dude is basically Rudy Gobert lite in terms of rim protection and defensive impact
Len Bias.  But fr probably Kobe. Of current players I think Rudy Gobert. He gets clowned on for crying but Rudy has top level care factor.

Rudy Gobert
"i didn't express it very well but i mentioned those players as a way to recognise that there is a point, in roster construction, where scoring becomes less valuable  but honestly i don't really think what you're talking about is really that big a problem. rudy gobert only averaged 14.3ppg last season compared to, say, terry rozier who average 20ppg, and just about everyone would agree rudy is the better player"
"There are around 200k people in SLC, with 2.6% black population, so there are approximately 5200 black people. Assume half men, so 2600 black men.   33.4% of the city’s population is 25 to 44, now we have 1736 people. I’m going to cut this group in half, as Clarkson is 29 and could pass as any age from 25 to 35, so we are now at 868.   Clarkson being 6’4” puts him in the upper 0.8% of height for the population ages 25-34, knocking this group down to 7 people.   Looking at the Jazz roster from last year, the following players fit the profile of black, 25-35, and 6’4” and above  -	Jarrell Brantley -	Jordan Clarkson -	Derrick Favors -	Rudy Gobert -	Shaq Harrison -	Georges Niang -	Miye Oni  Summary: if you see a very tall black man who looks like he can legally rent a car, there is a 100% chance he plays for the Jazz."
"Because Anthony Davis + LeBron + Frank Vogel's coaching is basically enough to still get a top level defense. Lakers had the #1 Defensive rating last year despite having both them out missing significant time.   If AD is the monster defender people say he is, he should be in DPOY conversations this year because if Rudy Gobert almost single-handedly makes the Jazz an elite defense, that's gotta be where a healthy AD has to be if he wants to be the player he prides himself to be."
Utah Jazz win it all. Rudy Gobert MVP.
"Rudy Gobert, the 5th highest paid player who is an incredible defender, and also capable of making freethrows at a rate which prevents hacking. The next closest non-scorer to Simmons (ranked 13 highest paid) is... Al Horford at 45th. Next closest is maybe Derrick White ($17,500,000  AAV, 79th highest paid)?"
"No one else failed in the same way.  Who else would you like held accountable? Seth Curry? Tobias Harris? Doc Rivers?  Tobias gets crucified by the fans all the time, but even he isn't SO BAD at any part of the game that he gets played off the court.  Seth Curry's offense was the only thing that was consistent outside of Embiid. His defensive burden was an issue but considering he was our second most important offensive player he can have a pass.  Doc Rivers? Literally, everyone holds him accountable and shits on him relentlessly.   Ben Simmons is the common denominator of issues for 3 consecutive years. Ben Simmons is great on one side of the court, and was such a burden on the other end and to the team as a whole that he had to be benched because he can't even manage to shoot 50% from the FT line. Ben Simmons passed up a wide open dunk out of fear that Trae ""Rudy Gobert"" Young would block him. Ben Simmons deserved to be held accountable."
Lmao Duncan Robinson &gt; Rudy Gobert as a post defender confirmed.
"You can't just cherry pick his worst moments and ignore his best ones, dude lol (although the series you're using against him he still put up great stats). You're leaving out the fact that he picked apart the clippers, he's carried his team twice against the blazers, he was fantastic in the spurs series. Hell he hit the series winner over Rudy Gobert playing the jazz. I'd say, yeah, his suns series especially wasn't as good as he's capable of, but you have to consider the team he was playing with. He still averaged 25/5.7/13.3. That's without having other consistent scorers on the team to boost his stats and divert the opposing defense.  All of that is ignoring the fact that you arbitrarily decided to exclude the large sample size which is the regular season, where he's literally been voted MVP and first team all NBA.  Again, I'm not even arguing that he definitively a top three player. Only that there is an argument to be made."
"Yeah idgaf which team you cheer for. Being a pacers fan doesn’t automatically make your opinion more valid. It is ironic though because you guys literally started two centers for the past two seasons and finished 14th and 6th in defensive rating, so it clearly isn’t a hard and fast rule like you’re acting it is. You’re acting like it’s some crazy phenomenon that an elite rim protector can make up for poor perimeter defenders when that’s literally what they’re there for. Center is considered the most important defensive position *because* they essentially “guard” the whole team from the most efficient shot in basketball. It’s why Rudy Gobert can play with shit tier defenders for 82 games and still *at least* drag them to an above average defence.   &gt;But this lineup would immediately be the worst defense in the NBA.  This is a gross exaggeration made more so because you dislike being disagreed with than it having any merit. You might as well have added “and it’s not even close” at the end. It’s impossible for a team playing Joel Embiid (assuming health, obviously) to be the worst defence in the NBA."
Rudy Gobert award.
"Top 5-7 is also top 10.  MVP ladder… yeah  I don’t really care. You think Julius Randle, Derrick Rose and Rudy Gobert were top 10 players in 2021, they were all top 10 in MVP voting.  It’s okay he was a teenager, and he was significantly better as a teenager than Kobe Bryant or Kevin Garnett who are two top 20 players of all time. LeBron I believe is second only to Jordan, there is no reason to pretend he was better than he was in 2003-2004."
Rudy Gobert eats 12 croissants for breakfast every day
"Nicolas Claxton, Al Horford, Rudy Gobert, Deandre Ayton, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Clint Capela, Semi Ojeleye (lol), Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, and Bam Adebayo have all been ""Giannis stoppers"" at some point or another. Last two have been pretty good though"
"RAPTOR also says that Rudy Gobert is the 2nd best player in the league, I don't think it's to be taken seriously lol"
Right but a super team has historically been more about offense. It’s not like if you gave Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert prime draymond green that they’d be considered a super team.
Rudy Gobert had a 9 block game v Chicago. Had it not been a blow out he probably would've broken that streak
"&gt; Yeah, my mistake for interpreting his starting 5 exactly as he presented it. Fuck me, right?  I guess? Just seems weird that you wouldn't assume the ability of the coach to just play whatever lineup they think is best. Like did you assume come playoff time they wouldn't be allowed to have lineup adjustments? But whatever, my bad for assuming, sorry.  &gt; Oh, please. Every contending small ball team in the last 5 years could at least shoot from 4 out of 5 positions.  Yes I agree, if clarke was playing big minutes next to simmons there would be problems. But besides that I just don't see the need for 5 shooters. The whole point of small ball is to have 5 quality offensive players, and so that you don't have to play some unskilled big (e.g. rudy gobert). Simmons would still be a fantastic small ball 5, on offense at the very least.  &gt; And so is saying they are a contender when you have multiple teams with top 10 players they have to compete against. Simmons can’t be your second best player on a championship team.  I think the jury is still out on Ben Simmons when he has a team built to accommodate his deficiencies. Sure this team would never be favored to beat the nets or lakers, but the way most people use the term ""contender"" is fairly broad. I could say something like ""a team with devin booker as their best player when there are teams with multiple top 10 players will never be a contender,"" but most people consider the suns to be weak contenders at worst. Also FYI I never even said this team would be contending, although I think they would be, when you consider the normal, broad definition of the term.  I'll just add, in 2017-2018, the sixers went 52-30 and were the 3rd seed in the east (this was good enough for 3rd in the west too). Joel Embiid played 63/82 games last year. Jo/Ben's best supporting players were robert covington, jj redick and dario saric. Fucking Jerryd Bayless played about 20mpg in the regular season. In other words the supporting cast was dogshit and they had 60 games of embiid instead of james harden, and that team still was the 3rd seed. I hope this shows why reading that the team in OP's post has a ceiling of 5th seed gives me an aneurysm."
"I bet you also think Rudy Gobert is the best defensive player to grace the league, right?"
"not only that, many and I'd argue most organization aren't caring if he is a top player/or winner, they realize he is a top revenue generator. I'd bet that this generation will ahve different metrics bc if you know how to market yourself and tell the story online, guys like Lamelo and Zion while they aren't good players like even like Leonard or Rudy Gobert or something...they probably generate revenue for them  thats why these cut throat owners are on their knees to bring these guys in bc they walk in, they do have to evnetualyl perform, but even as rookies for their highlights they hornets and pelicans are probably seeing some of the best jersey sales and season ticket interest in their lives...bc of these two young dudes  so that shows the power of that, whether I wish it were different is a nother case."
"I don't know. I think you can have a successful and even perfect career without winning it all at the end. Those moves by the GMs shouldn't be altered when it only was enough for the Conference Finals. It seems like you are saying that Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert were smart picks right now, but if they bring 2 championships to Utah in the next 5 years they were incredible lucky picks and I don't follow that logic."
Have you seen Rudy Gobert play in the playoffs?
Rudy Gobert 2.0 apparently
Maybe you have heard of the 3x DPOY Rudy Gobert that played along side Favors those years. Could have been something to do with it. Go to bed. Your done.
"I am saying the only reason Simons has any recognition is because the market he plays in. If he played in Utah, no one would know about him and he would be sitting behind Rudy Gobert. I believe this is Derrick Favors 11th or 12th year in the league. I don’t think Simmons will have that length of career unless something changes. In fact, the 76ers don’t have to do anything and could effectively end his career for 3 years. Which in essence would end his career."
People had there pitchforks out for Rudy Gobert when Covid hit
"An additional wrinkle is that your rim protector is now out, away from the basket, and a smaller guy is rotating in to try and block shots, it feels like there are any number of guards that get blown by regularly, but its one thing to blow by Donovan Mitchell and then have Rudy Gobert as the help defender, its a lot easier to blow by Rudy and then have Mitchell playing help D (or Jingles/whoever rotates)."
"But construct a roster of players that are AD and players worse than AD. You could have a roster of all stars, they easily win. Ad, cp3, Klay thompson, playoff pee, and Rudy gobert fit this criteria. That team is winning a ship"
"Bruh using just stats with no context is just lazy.   It’s like saying Giannis is a better rim protecter than Rudy in his DPOY season. In Giannis’ DPOY season, he kept the rim protection FG at 41% which is better than Goberts. Does that make him a better rim protected? Obviously not. With context, Gobert does his FG% on 9 attempts compared to Giannis’ 3 attempts.   You throwing in a stat without context like how often, what matchups and all that’s is just lazy af. It’s a skin deep statistical argument."
"Gobert doesn’t get hunted for mismatches, and he didn’t agains the clippers. They were successful because they avoided him, beat someone else, and then punished the help.   Al the stats on individual perimeter defense have Rudy as being a straight up better 1v1 defender than either Davis or Giannis. Rudy gave up .71 points per possession on isolations last year. Davis was at .96 and Giannis 1.06"
Oh come on man. Rudy has one glaring weakness which is common to big men. Getting hunted for matchups in the middy.  Giannis and AD are the only big men who can’t be exploited the same way.   I’m not saying it’s Rudy’s fault. Even brook got exploited the same way by the nets and hawks. It’s a common weakness for big men.  I think it was coaching and perimeter perimeter players fault. They didn’t have his back properly. Pinning the fault on Gobert isn’t right.   But. Giannis and AD can’t be exploited the same way. That’s why I said what I did. They won’t solve the entire perimeter D problem but they’ll be better in that scenario.
Unless you get a top level defender like Rudy Gobert or Draymond I don't think there's a reason to trade Kyrie. No player better than him is gonna be available any time soon so just keep the unfair god tier offense
Zach Lowe mentioned the Jazz refuse to switch with Gobert when teams go small. The Jazz have tried switching with Gobert in the past and he got killed by Curry and Harden in the playoffs.   People keep blaming Utah’s wing defenders for getting wrecked by the Clippers in the playoffs but Rudy was a defensive liability against the small ball lineups.
"Ja is overrated because of how flashy he is  I literally see people praising him for his missed dunks on this sub for ""being brave"" and stuff like that  Just go back and look at the thread of Rudy Gobert blocking his dunk attempt, everyone is impressed with Ja for trying something unbelievably dumb"
There's a video of Rudy Gobert playing the #1 prospect in France and he's hitting stepback threes with zero effort
"It's maybe kind of a ""Rudy Gobert"" situation because there are similar numbers with him  Basically both of them have obvious offensive limitations that hurt the team when they are on the court, but the people who replace them when they are off the court are actually far worse options overall"
"I think after a great ROY campaign, there were sky high expectations for Ja.  He was the best player on a young team who few believed would sniff the playoffs that first year, yet they were the 8th seed going into the bubble.   They let it slip (more about Portland getting healthier than Memphis).  The expectations for this season were to make the playoffs, and for Ja individually to sit improvement.  I anticipated him being at that just-missed-the-cut, borderline all-star status.  If he had followed that trajectory, he would have been in discussions with Murray and possibly Fox (I didn't know Fox would reach the level he has).  Half these things worked out.  Memphis did manage to sniff the playoffs.  However, I didn't feel like Ja individually showed much improvement over his rookie season, at least over the regular season.  There's some evidence he regressed, at least at face value.  His numbers per 36 remained largely the same or less.  His shooting splits all went down.  The bright spot for him and his future is how impressive he was in the last few games of the season and his playoff series.  (Per 36 stats) He went from 21/8 on .537 TS in the regular season to nearly 27/7 on .578 TS.  That's a respectable level, and he did it on more minutes played against a very good defensive team with Rudy Gobert manning the paint.  With Ja being a close-to non-shooter, those stats vs the Jazz are impressive.  Hopefully Ja can show the leap people were anticipating for this season going into the next one.  Between an actual off-season, another year's experience and growth, and his playoff experience this year, I think there's a good chance he has a much better season.  I think his team will be worse though."
"PG: Steph (super star), his gravity and scoring is unmatched  SG: Shai? I'm not sure here... duncan Robison? Bridges? I'm thinking shooter that gets the job done when defense is swarming KD and curry.  SF: KD (super star), I picked him because this also take him away from being on another team  PF: Draymond Green(all-star), facilitate the ball and the team well.  C: Rudy Gobert (all-star) great defense and help grab boards  -----  Note: If you dont consider draymond all-star then SG really open up the room for tons of people. Since rule says no injury, I pick Klay... gets the job done and already mesh well with most of the team. This goes to show how stacked the warriors team was."
"only the greatest 52nd pick of all time, blocked rudy gobert twice and a bunch of other 7 footers, houston rockets legend  **kenyon martin jr.**"
"You said the Jazz/nuggets are a more “popular” matchup to use your exact words. Nobody who is allowed to drink coffee in 49 states wants to see Rudy Gobert over Luka.   Talking about the pistons does nothing, and I never claimed they should get a Christmas Day game lmao. Talk about jokes when your team gets a ring ;~)"
Rudy Gobert is our only good defender. I actually want to trade for Simmons if the price isn't too high.
"Hardest part of this mental exercise is how we define a superstar. I'll try and avoid borderline top 10 players like Beal, George, Tatum etc.  PG: Jrue Holiday (Premier perimeter defense) SG: Duncan Robinson (Historic 3 pt shooting) SF: Kevin Durant (Kevin Durant) PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (A Greek freek) C: Rudy Gobert (DPOY)  Bench: Lonzo Ball (discount Jrue), Joe Ingles (3&amp;D+ bench playmaking), OG Anunoby (versatile 3&amp;D) and Jonas Valanciunas (monster rim runner/ rebounder)"
"WS/48 still isn’t very helpful though. David Robinson is 2nd all-time. CP3 is 5th all-time.   I don’t think anyone has *ever* placed those players in their Top 10.  James Harden is great but he’s 8th all-time. Rudy Gobert is 10th.  Yao Ming ended with a higher WS/48 than Dr. J, Dirk, and Hakeem.  It’s just another arbitrary mash-up of box score figures which doesn’t really do anything except *try* to quantify impact on winning."
"The list of all-time WS leaders is nowhere near the consensus best players list, though.  Karl Malone, John Stockton, Dirk, KG, and Artis Gilmore are top 10 all-time in WS.   David Robinson, Neil Johnston, and Chris Paul are top 5 all-time in WS/48. The top 10 also includes Rudy Gobert.  Win shares and all those other “advanced” metrics are cheeks.   The only thing that really holds weight from a statistical standpoint IMO is pure production (PPG/RPG/APG) and key efficiency metrics (TS/rTS/Turnover Rate)"
"Simmons can drop 42 along with DPOY defence while guarded by Rudy Gobert…  KPJ has had seven good games in 3 years bro. Cmon lol I like the kid but he’s barely showed anything, trading him *and* the worst contract of all time for Simmons is robbery"
"We're just 3 years removed from Drummond's last All-Star selection, and just one year removed from a 5 season run of him averaging 15.9 ppg, 15.0 rpg, 1.8 apg, 1.6 spg, and 1.5 bpg, during which he led the league in rebounding 4 times, and led the league in Defensive Win Shares twice. If he was coached and used like Rudy Gobert, he wouldn't try to (or be allowed to) do too much with the ball on offense, wouldn't be a meme, and would still be a valuable high-paid starter, rather than a 27-year-old former All-Star with no significant injury history forced to take a backup role on minimum salary."
"Rudy Gobert is close, though he's still on a team.  Both have a skill that is different than where the league us heading.  Cam is basically an option qb, Rudy is a back to the basket, d-minded big.  Both could have adapted, but didn't.  Cam could improve his throwing, Rudy his outside shot.  Both rub some people the wrong way w their antics.  Cam w his being ""cam"" and his outfits, Rudy the whole spreading covid thing.  Neither is very old, but neither is seen as being as good as they were just 5 years ago.  A lot of the other guys mentioned, had their careers altered due to injuries (i.e. d-rose).  These two saw the league change, and didn't adapt w it."
Nah Rudy Gobert
"""X guy is overrated"" or ""Y guy is underrated."" Gets thrown around so God damn much you end up making the argument for the guy being the opposite. Like Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons cannot be overrated if everyone is saying that."
"You’re saying Drummond isn’t the worst player in the league. Advanced stats clearly say he is.  Has no post game, no jumpshot from mid or deep, turns the ball over at an all time worst rate for post players, is a defensive liability because he can’t guard the perimeter or anyone with a bit of explosiveness, got traded for a 2nd round pick even though he was an “all-star”, everyone in Detroit started to hate him for padding his stats in the first half of games then disappearing for the 2nd half, can’t run a pick and roll to save his life, is barbecue chicken for elite big men like Jokic, Embiid, Gobert, Nurkic, KAT, Valanciunas.   He is horrible, I watched Pistons games when he played for them and they were a bad team, but then again that’s everyone’s excuse “you don’t watch the games” yes I do. I’m an NBA fan. Obviously I’m watching the games or I wouldn’t be on this subreddit. My favorite player all time is on the Jazz btw. Rudy Gay. Hope he shines off the bench for yall."
"Every player should grow an Afro. It would cause offensive geniuses to have to devise new formulations on the offensive end. Just imagine James Harden with an Afro closing out on a 3 pt shot. DPOY. Karl Anthony Towns with an Afro? Who needs Rudy Gobert when you have Afro KAT. Players need to take a hint at what Jarret Allen is doing. Mfer got that Fro, then the dough, now he’s coming for Mo"
Rudy Gobert is now a top 5-10 player in the league  Giannis is now far better than anyone else
Rudy Gobert becomes even more dominant than he already is
I think Alonzo Mourning was the MVP runner-up in 1999.  Mourning winning the award might have changed the landscape for defensive-minded player like Rudy Gobert to have legitimate MVP arguments.
That's pretty understandable. I was actually going to object to Gobert saying that AD was better; be it you said Rudy Gobert.
Not while journalists have a say. They’ll find a way to give it to Rudy Gobert
"this would be like someone shooting 45% on threes on 1.5 attempts a game and people saying they’re an all time three point shooter  on that same list, jared dudley is defending 1.8 a game and he’s doing it better than rudy gobert, is jared dudley an all time rim protector too or does the volume matter now"
this is about Rudy Gobert posting a jump shot picture to instagram guys.
"Well I mean this is a completely different argument to that you whereby you initially asserted he never guarded the other team’s best player lol.  For the record I don’t even disagree with you, I do think he should have guarded KD more in the BKN series.  That being said, why should the fact that he’s not as great an on-ball defender mean he’s overrated. Is Rudy Gobert overrated because he can’t guard Steph Curry on the perimeter? What Giannis brings to a team defensively outside of his relative (note relative) weakness in guarding on-ball is historically elite."
"Just the many unknowns on our team.  Our defense plummets when Gobert sits, but we got Whiteside to hopefully replicate at least 25% of Rudy does. He might drive Quin, Ingles, and Conley crazy on offense though.  Last year we lacked size at the 4, we got Rudy Gay to help with that but he's old and still considered a tweener 3-4. I don't have any expectation from Paschall tbh because while he looked good in the Warriors tanking season, it was just that, a tanking season and we probably signed him more likely cause he's Donovans super close friend.   Playmaking/age/health: We have Conley, Ingles, and Donovan as our playmakers but Conley is rarely healthy for a full season, and Joe has been looking washed more and more often the past 2 seasons. Depending on Donovan too much might lead to the ankle situation all over again."
"I disagree.  For one thing lebron himself was in the east.  The KG-Allen-PP-Rondo Celtics were great and they came up right after those awesome Pistons teams were over the hill.  Dwight was a one man wrecking crew on defense and a top three player at his peak, snuffing pick and rolls, grabbing every rebound and playing like a super athletic rudy gobert on the other end.    The conference lacked depth for sure but the era of the really weak eastern conference team (probably '99-'03 with conference champ knicks, pacers, sixers and nets) getting smashed in the finals predates lebron's prime."
"Okay, go watch the OKC series a few years back, vs the clippers. vs okc (different players on the team however), the nuggs series in the bubble, the grizzlies before the kawhi/PG clippers. Tell me one other team in the playoffs that could pull the line-up that the clippers had. the real issue was from the guards not being able to stay in front of their man which made rudy be in two places at once. Just shows you have no idea what you're talking about and that you do not watch the Jazz. You just go along with the herd shitting on Gobert because you have some random hate boner for him."
I think most people are pretty good at applying context to the stat. Nobody thinks Rudy Gobert is as effective a scorer as someone who creates shots for themselves
"&gt;	Lavonte David says Tom Brady saw one of his teammates crying after they won the NFC Championship Game. Brady went right up to him and said: ""What the f*** are you crying for? We're not done yet."" 🐐  &amp;   &gt;	Spikes talked with Robert Klemko of MMQB about his career with the Patriots, where he played from 2010-13. That conversation resulted in Spikes revealing just how uninterested Brady is in Pro Bowl talk. “I had one of my best years my third season,” Spikes said. “I’d been playing off the charts. And I didn’t get picked to go to the Pro Bowl. I was moping around, actually in tears, and a few guys were trying to lift me up, like, ‘It’s gonna be alright man. We’ve got to worry about what’s in front of us.’ Then The Pharaoh himself walks up to me—I used to call Brady The Pharoah and he hated that—Brady walks up to me and says, ‘Hey B, you think I play this s— to go to Pro Bowls? Get it together. Get your head up. We’re trying to win rings. That’s what it is here  Rudy Gobert would have hated Brady.  Saban &amp; Belicheck are also obsessive with terrible attitudes."
"And I’d rather have Gobert than Capela and some assets. It’s not a trade that makes too much sense for either team, but it’s the least ridiculous trade for Rudy out there. The fact that it’s not something either team really wants just goes to show that Rudy’s extremely unlikely to be moved at any point in the near future."
Rudy Gobert can probably make fade away 3s in practice NBA players are just on a different level compared to everyone else
"Sorry, all—we’re keeping him. I look forward to the day we unveil a Rudy Gobert statue next to Karl and John and when we hang his number in the rafters."
"Everybody is hating one these terms but I feel like when used properly you are essentially describing the whole point of the spear or the guy throwing it analogy. I feel like most of the it’s a poor way of describing how well someone can play with others combined with volume vs efficiency. There are exceptions to every rule but it’s almost accurate.  Take kris Middleton, klay Thompson, devin Booker, all of these guys are people I consider ceiling raisers. Guys that can’t carry your offense for an entire season but can make it elite. These guys are all pretty efficient   Compare that to Rudy gobert, Westbrook, , all guys that can carry a team but you have to scheme around some facet of their game so they need some specific pieces to be effective  Some guys can do both, Lebron, Kawhi,"
"This is a tough question in general, but even tougher because this sub has no idea how to evaluate defense/Rudy Gobert in general.  Look at those downvoted comments lmfao."
"Patty Mills, Jayson Tatum, and Rudy Gobert made me spit out my milkshake"
Would UTAH benefit from a straight Rudy Gobert/Danny Green swap? They get an elite defender and decent shooter in Danny Green
Rapm isn’t the only thing I look at. Lowry also has great box numbers and unlike Rudy his game doesn’t fall apart in the playoffs. Also rapm can have funky samples in one year stuff. Over 3 years from 2015-18 Lowry has a great 3 year split among the best. Gobert is one of the best over the last few years but You hve to knock him down with his poor impact ratings in the playoffs.
"Narrative unanimity and/or rule changes. If they bring back hand checking, that opens it up a lot, because guards will be able to defend larger players one-on-one without coaches sending another guy over. Players, opposing coaches, and media members would all have to agree about the vote publicly. The award was originally made in part because Michael Cooper and Sidney Moncrief weren't getting enough credit. The player would also have to *look* insanely active on-ball, not just be insanely active on-ball. Even big fans of the sport don't see defense unless it results in a block or steal. He has to switch onto big guys and strip them or not give up ground, and jump passing lanes for steals. It would also require the player to be good on offense. Like Mookie Blaylock or Eddie Jones two-way good. Unlike some of the bigs that have won the award/finished high in the voting that have been stiffs on the other end, a guard has to justify the big minutes they would need for cumulative stats like DefWS, anything using +/-, even steals. That's why someone like Matisse Thybulle can't win it, but Rudy Gobert can. I don't think the days of Doug Christie getting DPOY votes will be coming back.  Here's a Frankenstein's monster of what I think it would take:  * Dwyane Wade's help blocks * Gary Payton's visible on-ball activity * Chris Paul's late 2000s help steals * Jrue Holiday's ability to take a back-down by thrusting his hips * Sidney Moncrief's shot strips and hip angle cutoffs (much harder when players can carry the ball for two steps and never get called) * Jamal Crawford's likeability (when he isn't on your team) * Mo Cheeks' push-ahead poke steals when defender is in a low dribble * Tony Allen's forearms and ability to get away with hand checking * Crazy lateral acceleration. I can't even think of a comp at this size."
"royce oneale or rudy gay  gobert almost never guards AD, at least historically, the lakers have always had some guy like gasol or drummond or someone on the floor  royce and bojan did all of the AD guarding last year"
"So, let's accept that premise. I would disagree with it, but let's take it as true.  It doesn't matter.  It's that simple. It doesn't matter. A dominant defensive center, in the playoffs, does nothing. It's why Rudy Gobert gets played off the floor year after year. Elite offenses make elite defensive centers completely useless in the playoffs. Building around a dominant defensive center is a perfect way to get smashed in the playoffs. That's exactly what Boston did to Embiid when he didn't have Ben around to hide the fact that he's not actually a dominant defensive center, he just has a top 3 defender in the league there to hide his myriad defensive flaws. Trade Ben, and the defense collapses. The on/off numbers from the past two years show it too. As for dominant on offense, he's still not a primary ballhandler. He will never be a better offensive player in the playoffs than an elite on ball guy. That's pretty much all there is to that.  You know why there hasn't been a championship winning center since Shaq? They changed the rules a few years later (03-04). The rule changes made it impossible to dominate like Shaq dominated. Building a team around prime Shaq, the way Shaq played in 1999, in 2021, would fail miserably. Ignoring how much of an impact those rule changes is a common issue among NBA fans.  Finally, take note that as much as Embiid carried the Sixers, he also killed them. Go back and watch the Kawhi shot. Watch Ben. Watch Embiid. Ben has Kawhi locked down, Embiid screens Ben and then can't get to Kawhi. Go back and watch the last few minutes of each loss in the Atlanta series. Watch Embiid try to do everything himself rather than play within the offense. Unless Embiid can harness his desire to win into something productive, he will kill the team every time because he tries to do everything himself, *especially* when he shouldn't. And I don't know that that's fixable."
Rudy Gobert
"Rudy Gobert, Bam, Jimmy Butler"
I’m gonna disagree with you here. Not on PG but on Gobert and Ben. There’s a difference between having a bad playoffs like harden or PG have done before. And just simply being too limited of an offensive player to be effective in the playoffs like Ben or gobert. PG could be the exact same player he always is and still play well in the playoffs. There is literally zero chance Ben or Rudy play as well in the postseason as they do in the regular season.
Rudy Gobert
"Ben Simmons, Rudy Gobert, Paul George last year. Anyone who's really talented but flawed and performs poorly in the playoffs."
stats would suggest that rudy gobert was better than steph last year
"There’s a lot of NBA 7 footers who are more skilled than Giannis. Jokic is more skilled in every facet of the game, just less athletic. KAT and Lopez are better shooters. Mason Plumlee is a more creative passer. AD and Rudy Gobert are better shot blockers despite being less mobile and appearing to not jump as high. Embiid has better footwork and post moves. If I started talking about past players the list of more skilled 7 footers could go on forever.  There’s literally like 3 guys that you could argue are more athletic than Giannis all time.   I think harden is just saying that being one of the most athletic people to ever play basketball makes the game a lot easier to dominate. It’s really not that crazy."
Rudy Gobert: Thank God it's not true.
"The list of people who they have ranked as worse prospects than Elfrid is pretty epic. Embiid, Giannis, Paul George, Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Rudy Gobert, Bradley Beal, it just goes on and on and on, lol."
Rudy Gobert.
"Yeah I mean RFAs and stars once they hit 30 are often a good source for this. Chris Paul 2018, Rudy Gobert 2020(not 30), Allen Crabbe 2016(we cant lose him for nothing!), John Wall 2017(him not aging super well even if he had bad luck wasnt hard to see), Tristian Thompson 2015, many LeBron role player free agents really, Nic Batum 2016(cant ruin our momentum from the previous yr)"
Rudy Gobert hits halfcourt there's in practice videos
"Rudy Gobert man, great rim protector and rebounder and that’s about it. Dude will have the value of a replaceable center in no time while being paid Max"
"I remember this game and was dumbfounded by the reaction the general media had. ""Rudy Gobert did not capitalize on Hardens bad night"" lol"
Kyrie Irving   James Harden  Khris Middleton   Jerami Grant  Rudy Gobert
"Eh ""2nd best player in the world, Rudy Gobert"" seems kind of sus lol"
"&gt; Actually, I don’t know if any star in the history of the league became a better rim protector in the tail end of their career…  Wilt Chamberlain and Tyson Chandler would be 2. Wilt is the most clear example of this on the Lakers.  I would also say for Duncan even early in his career he wasn't particularly athletic or played above the rim. He was a defender that always positioned his body well and cut off angles. So age wasn't as much of a factor. He was more like Marc Gasol or Rudy Gobert."
"I'm trying to think of one for Rudy Gobert that is accurate, and a hot take, and won't have people attacking me online and making me feel bad. I'll just not."
"Well, it is like comparing apples and oranges. You don’t often see comparisons of totally unlike things. Like, “whose better? Drew Brees or JJ Watt?”  I mean, you can probably try to make an argument, but their games are so different that it barely makes sense.   Also, I think people hate on Gobert, but you add him to pretty much any team other than the Sixers and their defense vastly improves.   I agree with you for sure, but I think it’s not an unpopular take, not because of the opinion, but just the idea of comparing two players that effect the game so differently.   As a fun thought experiment, add either one to the Kings and which one makes that team make the playoffs. It can only be Rudy I would think.   Maybe not a great example since Fox and Westbrook are redundant."
"Saying OG is a ""way better defender"" is like saying Rudy Gobert is a better defender than Jrue Holiday. It makes no sense because they play completely different positions. Lonzo's shooting gets better every season too.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm taking Lonzo over OG"
"You brought up team performance when you had no argument for Brown on an individual level. Not me. I'm just gonna save my keyboardstrokes, I'll never change your opinon. I'm sure you'd want no part of Rudy Gobert either on your team since he's been exposed in the playoffs twice now too.   Keep talking yourself into Jaylen Brown, every Celtics fan I've ever interacted with online thinks he's more valuable than AD, PG or Kawhi who'dve been available for a trade if Brown was thrown in. Not even talking about the contract situations when either of these players was avilable. It's a waste of time, you couldn't convince me that Simmons is better than Bam either for bias reasons. Let's just save us both time"
"Because Rudy Gobert, the supposed clear best defender of this generation got cooked constantly from Reggie Jackson driving at his face. The whole team are frauds."
"Anthony Edwards on playing against Rudy Gobert:  ""With a guy like that, you can't stress about him rebounding. That's what he's gonna do. Motherfucker's 9'7"", 475 pounds. Ain't nothing you can do. We could box four people on him and he's still gonna grab the board."""
"It's the way that block/charge works outside the circle. Same for contesting ""natural"" layups- rim protectors like Rudy Gobert can't just leap across the key with momentum. They have to either jump straight up or not make contact.  I am specifically concerned about the second part of my point, rewarding defenders who get fooled."
"What does ""pack it up"" mean?  I think there's a tendency especially in the analytics side to think that teams are either rushing toward contention, rebuild, or mediocrity and sometimes fail to acknowledge incremental improvement is possible.  I think some of the teams on that list have gotten a little stale, like the Pacers, and could stand to shuffle the deck by dealing either Turner or Sabonis but that doesn't necessarily portend to an entire rebuild. But it should always be remembered that guys like Rudy Gobert, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, and John Collins were taken outside of the lottery, so its not like those teams couldn't just try to continuously gain talent.  And some of those teams are in smaller markets which may not have the stomach to willingly break up an alright team and start from the absolute beginning again"
They can be great floor raisers with defence. Like rudy gobert
I’m not sure the exact trades but the picks that became Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert originally belonged to Denver
"1st team all defense, at center, for a rookie, after 4 games played ... over last year's DPOY Rudy Gobert?"
Don't look now but offensive superstar Rudy Gobert is averaging more PPG (18.7) than elite post defender James Harden (16.0)
Rudy Gobert is 100% in already.
"Or Shaq and Donovan Mitchell. Or Shaq and Rudy Gobert.  You know, I think it's a Shaq thing"
"It’s probably overused in Jazz circles, but screening (and especially screening well) is an important part of the game. A huge reason Conley had his career best year in both 3pt% and attempts was Rudy’s screens. Over and over Rudy would screen and re-screen Conley’s defender and get Mike absolutely wide open for an easy look without having to make a single pass. Nothing’s recorded on the box score for Rudy, but Gobert definitely has an unusually good ability to get his teammates quality looks.  Screen assists have a lot of subjectivity to them (as do regular assists) and shouldn’t be taken as gospel, but I think it’s a step in the right direction in understanding that there’s things a player can do besides get points/assists/rebounds/steals/blocks that can help their team win."
rudy gobert
The day Rudy Gobert is even an MVP finalist is the day MVP award loses all credibility.
"They don't call Rudy ""The Gobert Factor"" for nothing.  Just him standing anywhere near the rim deters shots, and you can see it happen very clearly every game."
Rudy Gobert is gonna flirt with 20 ppg  Please
"The time was about evenly split. 7.1 minutes vs Gobert (13/2/0 on 100% shooting), 7.9 against Whiteside (11/4/6 with his singular missed shot). You're fooling yourself if you think he wasn't dominating Rudy too."
"3 games in, there’s no way to trust RAPTOR, because it’s all just on/off. For example Rudy Gobert is averaging 19/19 on 73% true shooting and has a RAPTOR of -3.5."
"&gt;Is this the same metric that said Rudy Gobert was the 2nd best player in the league last year?  No, it's the metric that had him as the player with the 2nd greatest statistical impact according to their model."
Is this the same metric that said Rudy Gobert was the 2nd best player in the league last year?
"The Nuggets traded the 1st round pick that became Rudy Gobert for a 2nd rounder and cash. The 2nd rounder was Erick Green, who played half a season of games for the Nuggets and got waived, then finished his brief career on a couple of 10-days with the Jazz."
Next perennial DPOY after Gobert? Somewhere between Giannis and Rudy
"&gt; Harrison Barnes is top 5 in FTA per game, higher than James Harden, Trae Young and Joel Embiid.  Rudy Gobert is top 1 lol"
"I think the difference is against the Bucks, at least Gobert cant stay at the rim and while Giannis might score 40, the Utah defense is still working as intended.  Jokic however will give you 40 while also making Rudy spend half the game at the 3 point line, which destroys the integrity of the entire Jazz defense."
"Their tallest player last night was 6’8 against Rudy Gobert  and to my knowledge they had Bol on the bench   absolutely ridiculous, they need to trade him bc he’s just sitting there he plays like 20 minutes a season"
Meanwhile Rudy Gobert has a free throw rate of 1.333 right now lmfao.

\&gt;He was pretty much who Rudy Gobert is now     Idk if you even watch either of them
Rudy Gobert will be the Goat defense player when he retires
Rudy Gobert with a season low of 16 rebounds
"Rudy has checked out after 5 minutes every game since the beginning of last year. It has nothing to do with Jokic, it’s just his regular rotation because we’ve found running Conley/Gobert three stints each half works really well."
"They were really only on the court together for the first 5 or so minutes. Rudy gets taken out first so he can play 3 shifts each half, while Jokic tends to play almost the whole first and sit out the first half of the second (when Rudy has his second shift). Rudy got his second rest almost exactly when Jokic came back in and then they were only on the court together again for a short bit before Jokic got hurt.   This happens all the time, Jokic will put up a bunch of points mostly against whoever Rudy’s backup is and then Reddit nephews will act like he got all of them posting up Gobert."
"Rudy Gobert needs a new barber... he must really hate clippers.  Sorry jazzbros, I couldn't help it when I thought of the joke."
your team gave rudy gobert the supermax
Rudy Gobert can't guard elite perimeter players or elite centers. Mans useless in the playoffs
"Bro you started your comment by comparing Rudy Gobert, in the top league in the world, to a dude at an amateur pick-up game. Your argument has zero traction. They’re out there playing hard, shit happens."
"Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler,  Kyle Korver, John Wall, Marcus Camby, Rajan Rondo, Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, Marc Gasol, Cedric Maxwell, Lou Willians, Jamal Crawford, Kevin Love, Al Horford, Demar Derozan, Andre Igoudala, Rudy Gobert and maybe DeAndre Jordan, Isaiah Thomas and Paul Millsap should all be in the hall of fame"
rudy gobert/joakim noah
Well that proves it Rudy Gobert is the GOAT
Rudy Gobert lmao. What a terrible contract.
"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/rudy-gobert/  Estimated 5 year market value: 200M.  That's already pricing in he is a declining asset, if he continues to play at the same level then his market value is much higher.  Rudy is not flashy but he is the best defensive player in the league bar none and a big part of the Utah Jazz recent success."
"Funny. You have a bunch of guys who were top 10-15 players in the league when they got their supermaxes, and then Rudy Gobert who isn't even top 30"
"There are only 9 players in the league on supermaxes: Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, and Rudy Gobert."
"No, DeMar was not better except for Lowry's first season where he was splitting time at point guard with Calderon. Once he became the full time defacto starting point guard in his second season as a Raptor, that is when the Raptors really started to take off. DeMar was the face of the franchise due to being drafted by us and things like the ""Don't worry, I got us..."" tweet after Chris Bosh left to Miami which endeared him to us and the 1st option on offense which many people think equals being the better player but isn't true. For example, Lowry being better than Siakam in 2019 and 2020 seasons, or Rudy Gobert being better than Mitchell in his rookie and sophomore season and even arguably in his 3rd season. He scored more points than Lowry, but he was not better in totality than Lowry. This is reflected in the impact stats, lineup data, advanced stats and simply the eye test in which it was made glaringly obvious."
Rudy Gobert
Another crazy stat is that Rudy Gobert is averaging 20+ rebounds.
god damn at this point i really hope he yams it on Rudy GOBert
"Rudy Gobert   Dame  KAT  And I've always been a believer in Mo Bamba, still think the guy can make a splash in the league."
Rudy Gobert basically just sticks his elbows out when he sets screens. They really need to crack down on screens. It's too easy for the offense right now imo
Due to how the nba is played right now. Prime carmelo would basically be a taller faster stronger brand ingram. That's a scary sight to see.    Prime Dwight imagine on the Utah jazz instead of Rudy gobert would be a sight to see with Donovan Mitchell.  Prime melo on the lakers  cause of floor spacing
"Yea, i even made my own video breakdown of a lot the bad defense down the stretch of those games   So you’re expecting perimeter defenders to never get beat vs 5-out offense? Thats not a reasonable expectation, the are nba players. Even a team like LAL relied heavily on getting into rotation which means heavy reliance on [helping and recovering](https://streamable.com/f2eucz)   Im not saying the jazz were good defensively on the perimeter, im saying that Rudy would be a problem even if they were. The exact same thing happened vs Houston and they had good perimeter defenders back then  In the modern nba, defenses have to be able to constantly be in their rotations on any given defensive posession. Jazz cant do that with Gobert so they opted to concede open corner 3s and even then Gobert blew his assignment a few times. Its not about Gobert being in two spots at once, its that once he takes away the rim and is asked to make an additional rotation to a shooter then his value drops significantly on that end  2 5-out offenses have been exploiting him like this"
So did defensive player of the year Rudy Gobert. So does Embiid.
"Nope, Ty Lue straight up admitted that the clippers game plan was to target Gobert. They literally wanted him on the floor  The reason for this is because the clippers 5-out offense is designed to feast on drop coverage bigs like Gobert. While the Jazz POA defenders weren’t good either that doesn’t excuse the play of Rudy Gobert"
"The whole “Rudy Gobert can’t guard the perimeter” nonsense.  He can’t guard the three point line and the rim at the same time, but he’s an excellent 1 on 1 defender in space."
Rudy Gobert +4.8  Rudy better offensive player than Giannis and Luka confirmed.
"Yuh, Giannis gently whispered “Rudy gobert is dpoy “ into keldons ear midair"
Rudy Gobert?
Weird how everyone forgets about 3x DPOY Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert. I know advanced stats say that he's a great defender but he gets cooked everytime I watch him play which I admit isn't super often.

"If he keeps this level of elite defense up, that’s a level of improvement in his game on par with the “if Giannis can learn to shoot 3s” discussions. Obviously Jokic was already an above average defensive player, but Rudy Gobert was arguably the most important player for the 1-seed Jazz last year. Centers are just that much more important than any other position on defense.   The way this guy just gets better and better every year, without fail, is incredible to me. He’s so nonchalant about it too."
Rudy gobert has been a fucking monster so far
Rudy Gobert remains underrated ... Monster   Also Davion Mitchell is an absolute mad man ... Sac really got back to back rooks who are fun as hell
"Against the clips, our drating was 136 with Gobert off the floor (122 with him on). Blaming Rudy for what happened that series is like blaming a quarterback for taking a bunch of sacks when they have the worst O-line in the league. At some point there’s only so much even a fantastic player can do when their teammates but them in awful positions."
"Gobert by a good margin. Mitchell’s been insanely hot the last 2 playoffs, but that’s not the player he really is most days. If he’s really gonna shoot damn near 50% on 8 pull-up threes per game in the playoffs for the rest of his career, then yeah it’s probably Mitchell. But I really doubt that.  We stagger lineups with just Rudy and just Mitchell. The on-off data really doesn’t lie, Gobert has a much bigger influence on the game than Donovan."
"Really you havent heard of rudy gobert or dwight dominating the paints? This shit is just hilarious. Goodbye, man. it's clear your just interested in misconstruing words."
Rudy Gobert? Lol wtf is this guy just trolling or what?
"i mean i wouldn’t expect rudy gobert to make the list  edit: i remember this man shut down the whole damn league, nvm where the fuck is he?"
"The hawks have done everything perfectly since getting Trae. Huerter, Hunter, and Reddish are good draft picks, as was Collins pre Trae.  Gallo and Bogdonavic were good signings, but the biggest thing IMO is Capela. I hear so little talk about him relative to his skill, he’s probably the best rebounder in the league, a great defender, career 63% shooter. Like, I think he’s 95% what Gobert is but is mobile enough to play Deep in the playoffs. Like, top 4 centers are KAT, Rudy, Embiid and Jokic, and I’m not so sure Bam is surefire number 5 when Capela is this good.   So, if Trae is superstar, Collins is a semi star, Capela is rim protector, and you have 3 and D guys (elite on the D)…  Really I guess my point is fuck the Mavs lol. We could’ve gotten Capela I bet, and just… idk."
"Klay hasn't played since 2019. Dame is 6x 1st+2nd All NBA, Klay is 2x third team. Klay 5x all star Dame 8x. Klay has had some amazing playoff performances but Dame also has 2 series winning buzzer beaters, one in game 7. Why would you have Klay above him?  I've seen dwight brought up a lot so i'll paste one of my previous comments here:   Dwight has played 8 more seasons than dame and this is still a conversation because of how underwhelming the last 7 years of dwight have been. Dame is 31 and could have 3-4 more all NBA years as well as more postseason success if he changes teams.  Dame has been a 6x all nba player in an era of elite guards like steph, harden, cp3, klay, luka, russ. While the second best center when Dwight was in his prime was.....Andrew Bynum for 3 years?  Dame has made the playoffs 8 years in a row as the guy, longest active streak in the league.  I weigh what you did as a role player way less than what you did as a #1 option.  Rudy Gobert has 3 DPOY's and is going for #4 this year, great accolade but doesn't automatically mean you are a top 75 player.  To be clear I think Dwight should still be on there, but not at the expense of dame."

Yea. Giannis the weak side defender &gt; Giannis full time rim protector. That’s why you got to have a shooting Center with good rim protection out there with Giannis. The Bucks defensively have been at their peak when packing the paint as opposed to relying on help defense (a la the Jazz and Rudy Gobert)
My contention with calling Klay the second greatest shooter of all time is difficulty of shot and shot creation. What Steph does is an entirely different category of shooting. It's like comparing greatest dunkers and having Vince Carter at #1 for his difficult dunks and then putting Rudy Gobert in second because he set the dunk record on  .669 FG%.
"Dwight Howard, Ben Wallace, Dikembe Mutombo and Rudy Gobert."
Idk but if Rudy Gobert played in the 60s y'all would talk about him like you do with Bill Russell. Don't @ me.
Rudy Gobert couldn’t agree less
"I hate to be the guy to bring it up, but while we are arguing why AD and Dame over Howard in the first page. Reggie Miller made it in with ""only"" 3 All-NBA (all of them are 3rd team) and 5 all stars is just beyond me. Like, AD/Dame and Howard all have a way better resume than Reggie. Even Rudy Gobert has more all-NBA than him and I am not even counting his 3 DPOYs."
"Yes, this is another thing. Someone needs to show him some Rudy Gobert tapes"
Dwight was Rudy gobert on defense while carrying the offense
I absolutely love how Rudy Gobert literally initiated the entire American lockdown and everyone just forgets
Rudy Gobert
"People take away from all these players way too much.   Prime Steph Curry, not Steph Curry that dropped a triple double opening night, but 2016 MVP Steph, was legendary and had the best shooting of anyone that we’ve seen period.   John Stockton, who nobody will probably ever touch his steal and assist record was the greatest role player of all time. He did the dirty work that nobody wanted and had legendary court vision.   Tracy McGrady in his prime, scored 13 points in less than 45 seconds, legendary and clutch.  Carmelo Anthony in his prime was elite. He’s dropped off in recent years but everyone can appreciate his time in Denver and New York as amazing.   Rudy Gobert is in his prime. He’s won 3 of the 4 past DPOY awards and every team is forced to adjust their offensive plan to keep his impact as minimal as possible. Only 4 players have won 3 DPOYs, people won’t appreciate him until he’s gone.   Ayton hasn’t even tapped his prime yet. Still very young, very elite and underused for his shooting abilities in Phoenix. Will easily become a top 25 player in the league within the next 5 years."
"Lol he's doesn't suck. The things he chooses to do he does at an elite level, he's All-star for a reason. It's just peoples expectations of him are ridiculous.  You don't ask Rudy Gobert to shoot, why you ask Ben to just because he dribbles faster"
"Gonna get killed by everyone for this but:  John Stockton, Steph Curry, McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Rudy Gobert  6man: Ayton  This would actually be an amazing team, I just don't think these guys are/were as good as most think. I'm also mainly talking playoffs."
"Kyrie, Melo, Kuzma, T-Mac, Rudy Gobert"
"I think that a lot of it was scoring concerns that LaMelo seems to have worked out much much sooner than we thought. His shot looked bad in Australia, and he had bad percentages. His finishing looked inconsistent and one sided. His defense looked suspect. His passing and vision and height were really the only big pluses. Obviously those can be big pluses, but they're also the same pluses Ricky Rubio had. The fact that he seems to have dramatically improved in all those question areas is pretty remarkable and hard to predict.  Meanwhile Wiseman is a 7'1 athletic freak with physical measurements that rival Rudy Gobert. It's easy to see why the FO went with Wiseman."
I mean obviously Russell Westbrook is still a great player lol by success for his expectations and caliber tho thats star level  Also idk if there’s basically anyone paid over 100 mil aside from Rudy Gobert that doesn’t have some shot creating ability including centers
"Why do you think he hasn't tried? Bc he doesn't shoot in games? We don't ask any other non shooter to shoot in games!!! This isn't someone like Giannis who always shot in the league. This guy NEVER shot, came into the league not shooting 3s. That doesn't mean he didn't/doesn't work on it. Nobody chucks full court shots in games to get better at it, they know it's a bad shot and wasted possession. The same thing a non shooter shooting a 3 would be. Imagine if Rudy Gobert just started chucking a three or two a game just to ""try"", we'd call him crazy. We know he's a liability, his form is poor and he's a poor FT shooter. He's 6'11, it's not the norm at all for guys that big to be shooters (a big reason is bc of hand size). You can name anomalies and exceptions, but they're just that, exceptions.   You have sources for those? I remember one quote from him standing on the PG role, and I think that was before the draft or before his rookie season, but I think in the same quote he said he can play any position (tried a quick search and couldnt find the quote).  Brett even said they'd start using him as a PF in the bubble, but he got injured before the playoffs. Doc said they'd stagger him and Embiid, and play Ben as a C this season. Seems like Philly just realized too late that he isn't a PG"
"I believe the final 25 will be:      11 Locks: Elgin Baylor, Kobe Bryant, Steph Curry, LeBron James, Jason Kidd, Kawhi Leonard, Shaquille O'Neal, Gary Payton, Dolph Schayes, Dwyane Wade, Dominique Wilkins  6 Probables: Carmelo Anthony, Billy Cunningham, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Robert Parish, Russell Westbrook  2 Likely but on the bubble: Paul Pierce, Dennis Rodman  5 Squeaking in: Ray Allen, Dave Debusschere, Grant Hill, Bob McAdoo, Tracy McGrady  10 Biggest new omissions: Chris Bosh, Pau Gasol, Paul George, Draymond Green, Blake Griffin, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, Dikembe Mutombo, Tony Parker, Ben Wallace   4 Omissions from top 50: Dave Bing, Pete Maravich, Earl Monroe, Lenny Wilkens"
"really gotta stop this nonsense  rudy gobert was playing at a DPOY level and got 84% of the 1st place votes and dominated the field  simmons was playing at a runner up level, pretty good, but not really close to winning the trophy"
name me a star rim runner  The only one is Rudy Gobert whos arguably the best defender in the league  Also im pretty sure this list is for guards and wings

Rudy Gobert
"Yeah Ayton is 23, that makes a big difference between pondering maxing somebody like Paul George or even Rudy Gobert where you know they'll be declining on the back end of their deal.  Barring major injury (and Ayton hasn't been injury prone) there's just basically no way him on a rookie max is a bad deal in a couple years.  Worst case what, he doesn't improve hardly at all, he's still giving you a super efficient 16/11 and is one of five guys in the league who can give Jokic/AD/Embiid trouble defensively."
"Big Billy Bob was closer to a Rodman/Draymond green combo than Rudy Gobert.  He was an insanely agile, playmaking defensive big. He didn't score much relative to the volume scoring players of his time. But he was the ultimate team player.  Rudy is not the best comparison. Since Rudy is HUGE and Bill was undersized. Think Ben Wallace but without the muscle.  But there's really no other player like him. Draymond/Rodman are the closest but even then."
Rudy Gobert is Bill Russell if Bill Russell played with modern rules like a 3 point line
"I think Ja is still mad he couldn't finish *that* dunk over Kevin Love  Though he's sort of moved on to bigger targets, such as his obsession with trying to dunk on Rudy Gobert"
The Cavs start three 7 footers and one of them couldn't be Rudy Gobert smh
"2011-2012: Raja Bell, Devon Harris, Gordylox Hazelwood, Paul Millsap, and Al Jefferson.  2021-2022: Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neal, Rudy Gobert.  I've got my money on current team, but I would love to see Big Al post up against Rudy."
"Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Domantas Sabonis.  Arguably Clint Capela and Nik Vucevic."
"lol yeah exactly.  there's a reason you can't describe what happened in that series.  it's because you didn't watch it, or at least didn't watch it with enough knowledge and intent to form your own opinion.  we have exactly one player that is a competent perimeter defender, and the original game plan of having Royce guard PG didn't work once Reggie Jackson started lighting everybody up.  so we had to move Royce over to Jackson and put Gobert on PG as our only competent defender.  that left Bogdanovic guarding the 5, which he literally can't do, so coaches just left Terrance Mann open.  if you're interested in learning something and not just talking shit, watch that play that was on all the highlight reels of Mann dunking on Gobert.  Gobert picked PG up on the 3 point line, guarded his drive forcing him to give it up to Mann in the corner. Bogdanovic is the closest defender but doesn't move to close out on Mann because he was fronting Marcus Morris on the 3-pt line like he was denying an entry pass to Tim Duncan on the low post.   Gobert on that play picks up one of the best offensive players in the NBA, stops him from getting to the basket, then when he kicks it to the corner Gobert runs from the basket to the 3 point line and runs Mann off the corner 3, then follows him and contests his shot at the basket.    he was playing without reservation the best defensive basketball I've ever seen anybody play in my life during that series, but goobers like yourself just see the dunk highlight and go to bbref and think he sucked.    if you think Rudy Gobert played poorly in that series you're a moron."
Rudy Gobert gonna win his 4th this year
You posted this so people say Mikal lol  Probably Rudy Gobert though once all the reactionary stuff is gone
"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/. One of the variables that isn't refined for this particular analysis is team winning percentage. End of season winning percentage was used (because it was already available for a different analysis) rather than record at the all-star break."
"Rudy Gobert in 2019, these where his ranks in the league as of January 27 (before the All-Star team was revealed):      - 1st in win shares. - 1st in field goal percentage. - 1st in effective field goal percentage. - 1st in defensive win shares. - 1st in defensive box plus minus. - 2nd in true shooting percentage. - 2nd in offensive rating. - 2nd in total blocks. - 3rd in total rebounds. - 3rd in defensive rating. - 3rd in win shares/48. - 5th in VORP. - 5th in rebound percentage. - 5th in offensive win shares - 7th in block percentage. - 8th in box plus minus.      - 1st in dunks. - 1st in double doubles.      --      He'd been averaging 15/13/2.2 blocks per game on 65% shooting. He was the best player on a Jazz team that had won 9 of their last 10 coming into the announcement of the teams too."
"here are some fun stats. the first list below is the top 20 accrued Win Shares for anyone born outside of the US, and the second is the top 20 WS / 48 by the same criteria  'Nique is about as foreign as Kobe and this cross-section misses obv. folks like Tony Parker but i thought it interesting   *Foreign-ish WS Total*  * Tim Duncan * Dirk Nowitzki * Hakeem Olajuwon * Pau Gasol * Steve Nash * Patrick Ewing * Dominique Wilkins * Dikembe Mutombo * Tony Parker * Detlef Schrempf * Manu Ginóbili * Vlade Divac * Al Horford * Marc Gasol * Peja Stojaković * Carlos Boozer * Rudy Gobert * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Rolando Blackman * Kiki Vandeweghe  *Foreign-ish WS / Game*  * Boban Marjanović * Nikola Jokić * Rudy Gobert * Tim Duncan * Clint Capela * Yao Ming * Arvydas Sabonis * Chris Boucher * Dirk Nowitzki * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Joel Embiid * Manu Ginóbili * Ivica Zubac * Jonas Valančiūnas * Dwight Powell * Tiago Splitter * Hakeem Olajuwon * Pau Gasol * Kyrie Irving * Todd MacCulloch"
Ironic? As a Rudy Gobert fan I'm exactly the person you would expect to be triggered by it
He could make it  3 frontcourt starters  Jokic LeBron AD (fan vote)  3 front court reserves Paul George Rudy gobert  JV/ayton/towns/KP
"""Tell me you're a nephew without telling me you're a nephew.""  It's weird when people say this shit, as if players from the past were playing an entirely different sport or something. You don't think anyone else in Eaton's era even *considered* just hanging out in the paint and erasing shot attempts...?  Of course they did! It's just that Eaton was so much better at it than everyone else. He had phenomenal spatial awareness, timing, and an intuitive understanding of defensive concepts that made him an absolute monster on that end of the floor. He might not fit perfectly in today's game, but fucking Rudy Gobert has a max contract for the same team, so let's not get carried away and say he wouldn't make it 20 minutes in today's league."
"Being a unanimous MVP depends on the competition, not just how well you're playing individually. Yes, Steph is having a historic season so far. AGAIN, I agree he should be the MVP if voting happened today. But KD is also having a historic season.  In 2016 Steph won the scoring title, the steals title, averaged 30/6/7 on 50/40/90 splits, set the 3pt record, and led the warriors to the winningest season of all time.   Second place in voting was Kawhi, who averaged 21/7/2 on 61% TS and was the DPOY. Which is great. But that'd be like if Rudy Gobert, the reigning DPOY averaging 15/15/1 on 72% TS was the second best player in the league. Of course Rudy is not going to get an MVP vote, and if he was the second best player in the league I'd agree that Steph is looking at another unanimous vote. BUT  The gap between 2016 steph and 2016 Kawhi is SO much greater than the gap between 2021 steph and 2021 KD."
"You should use a cutoff year. I think of the NBA in three eras. 1946 to 1979, 1979 to 2014, 2015 and after.  It's somewhat arbitrary but my rationale is the first 33 years were dominated by centers, and 99% of the players went strictly with their strong hand.   The 79-80 season was when Magic and Bird entered the league, and ushered in the era of players who played strong with either hand and traditional stereotypical roles evolved based on skillsets. It also represented the first wave of players who could legally dunk in HS and college after it had been banned.  The 2014-15 season unlocked the power of the 3-pointer as a major offensive weapon. Before then, teams might shoot 8 or 9 threes per game by design.  That being my criteria, Russell led era 1, Hakeem led era 2, followed closely by Mutombo and Eaton, and in era 3, I'd call it a tie between DeAndre Jordan and Rudy Gobert."

"For the longest time my wife thought whenever I said “Rudy Gobert” I was talking about our mascot. Can’t fault her for her logic, though.   He’s the “Jazz Bear” in case anyone cares to know."
Nah I just think of Rudy Gay as the main Rudy because he was on the spurs for 3 years. Didn't even think about Gobert.
First one is definitely wrong so agree there.  Kobe is about the 8-12 range. People forget he wasn’t even the best player on his own team that won 3 Championships but he still was one of the greatest SG’s to play.  Anyone who think Rudy Gobert isn’t good needs to run head first into a brick wall.   Great choices here dude!
"Good to hear! I’m glad you were able to take a deep breath! So let’s talk about exaggerations. I did some research and couldn’t find a thing about Wilt having a 55” vert. I did find a few things claiming a 48” vert and a few  articles breaking that down to say he realistically had around a 35-40”. Should I link that? Although if you type in Wilt Chamberlain 55 vert it’s one of the first things that comes up. Also I couldn’t find anything verified that he benched 500lbs, but that really doesn’t mean too much. I’m sure Andre Drummond benched more than Rudy Gobert, that doesn’t really translate to the court. And if anything the whole averaging 50pts a year hurts your argument. It really shows the level of talent in the league, and when he finally went up against some decent competition (Bill Russell) his stats fell off dramatically. I can link that too if you want."
The correct answer is Rudy Gobert
"Rudy Gobert  The amount of hate he gets is insane for someone who plays as hard as he does every game. He does so much on both ends that go unnoticed.  His development/improvement over the years is also commendable, there are so many tall skinny guys who don't make it past a backup big or out of the league, yet Rudy has turned himself into an All-Star"
"&gt; I legitimately don’t know where the narrative of him being a bad defender came from.  He used to get targeted on switches by other teams.  Notably, when the rest of the defensive lineup was Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant.  The ""no shit Steph is the weak link"" lineup. Did you know he's also a worse rim protector than Rudy Gobert?"
Why do we call Rudy Gobert a good defender when he can’t lock up Curry 1 on 1 on the perimeter.
"Ah good point. We should get Rudy Gobert to do it, he knows a thing or two about things going viral."
Someone last year put together a hilarious set of clips with Rudy Gobert.  So many NBA players nope right out of a layup just because Rudy's nearby.  Doesn't show up in the stat sheet
Rudy Gobert being a prime example
This is what I’ve always found funny about AD. He’s super efficient at the rim that even though he’s a terrible shooter his overall efficiency is still good (but not great for a big). He’d be a much more impactful player if on offense he played like a better version of Rudy Gobert than taking a bunch of crap midrange fadeaways.

in what world is rudy gobert not on this list
David Locke does a good job using advanced stats to explain Rudy Gobert. Things like shots missed when Rudy is the closest player. Shot selection when Rudy is the floor etc.  There is a tone of defensive stats that no one ever talks about because they are to wordy to explain without diagrams.
"Rudy Gobert hasn’t lead the league in any of those categories in the 3 years he’s won DPOTY, last time it happened was 2017 when Draymond won DPOTY and lead the league in steals"
"The Rudy Gobert cycle:  -Start Season  -chad regular season, blocks tons of shots and boards well  -Jazz hype train builds  -wins dpoy  -takes on dominant pnr ball handler in postseason gets picked apart because he struggles guarding on the perimeter  -Everyone Shits on Gobert in offseason  -Start season"
Nobody on the warriors expect Draymond Green to be Rudy Gobert. Why are people expecting Rudy to be Draymond. I don't get it.
Jazz problem is Rudy can’t guard corner threes. It wouldn’t be as big of a problem if other teams had to play a big but they don’t since Gobert doesn’t punish small guys on the other end.  The other option is to trade Ingles or Bojan for a better defender
Of all time?  PG- John Stockton SG- Donovan Mitchell SF- Andrei Kirilenko PF- Tim Duncan C- Rudy Gobert 6th man- Joe Ingles  Current players?  PG- Ja Morant SG- Donovan Mitchell SF- Joe Ingles PF- Giannis C- Rudy Gobert
"After seeing the Rudy Gobert post-game interview, I kinda understand his pain.  He was open for a dunk here that may have as well been the dagger."
yeah it’s one thing to say we need to pass more but the idea that Gobert just needs the ball more for us to be better is ridiculous. Jazz fans will never criticize Rudy no matter what lol
"Its so weird for someone to recognize how good a defender gobert is but also say ingles is solid. Ingles and bogdanovic are the worst wing defenders in the league who get actual minutes. We need to close with rudy gay and hope gobert, o’neale, and gay can cover up for mitchell"
Rudy Gobert?
It was so hilarious last year watching PG and Reggie Jackson just go right pass them every play and making Gobert help which left shooters wide open every time. I felt so bad for Rudy lol

"Conley and Ingles are still solid, though older and slower.  Bogie and Rudy are okay. Mitchell is okay too but it looks like he gambles for steals every third play for some reason. I don't really know how to judge either of Clarkson or Whiteside's defense.  But both Royce and Gobert are unreal. Royce can make it hard as fuck for opposing team's best player one on one, while Gobert has been and is the DPOY. You could have 4 g-leaguers out there with Gobert and probably still boast an average defense."
80% of Rudy Gobert for 20% of the price babyyyyyy
Yes because a guard (who carried your offense) being a bad defender should torpedo an entire team's defense.   Meanwhile:  [Reggie Jackson dances on Rudy Gobert after taking over in the 4th Qtr Jazz vs Clippers Game 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0UIxTK7u1o)  [Terance Mann EPIC POSTER DUNK on Rudy Gobert in game 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyNWoQDA5Fw)
"The myth of Gobert being a liability when attacked by guards bla bla bla is just a fucking myth.  Yes Chef Curry cooked him at times, no shit. But overall it's a myth. Here's a paper debunking this myth and there 's been some others.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/amp/"
This is basically the offensive version of Rudy Gobert as a rookie.  Rudy barely got minutes but he still was an impact full defensive player his first 2 years.  Like he was really buried in the bench despite being an amazing defender.
"Maybe, but doubtful. Rudy Gobert has lead the league in total rebounds for the last 2 years and is doing so again this year. Even if he keeps up his current pace this year of 15 RPG it’d take him another 7 years playing 82 games every year (into his age 36 season) to reach 15k career boards. Just unlikely without a big increase to pace."
"Dame.  Spider is great, but he's also on a better team and the Jazz can hide two 6'1 guards with Rudy Gobert in the paint. Jazz also have depth and good shooting around those two.  Damian Lillard is a very special shooter and scorer. Spida still young and can change, and probably will keep adding to his game, so who knows the future? But rn it's easily Dame."
It’s just surprising. It seems much easier to replace Rudy Gobert type production than it is to replace what someone like Donovan Mitchell does. I just don’t see how it’s close.

Roleplayers don't run entire systems dude. I don't think you know Draymond. Is Rudy Gobert a role player? Is Anthony Davis a roleplayer?
Rudy Gobert has .732 efg that's not how you measure shooting. Plus embiid's only played 9 games and still shot almost 40% from 3 on 4 attempts a game.
Rudy Gobert is the best player on the Jazz
"I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone say Rudy gobert is the best player on the jazz. Your take may be right though. I don’t really follow jazz basketball that closely but my first instinct is to say that Donovan Mitchell is clearly the best player on the jazz. When injured you are just that, injured."
"That's why he's 1 in my eyes, I'm very biased but what he does for an offense is similar to what Rudy Gobert does to a defense"
That's not true at all.  Every good defender worth their marbles has been dunked on.  Rudy Gobert is who I consider the top near rim defender and there's literally lists and videos of him being postered. https://youtu.be/d3IuwtB3h14
You absolutely can individually carry a defense and Duncan absolutely did that some years. See Rudy Gobert. Jazz have some solid defenders around him in guys like Royce O’neale but were exposed by the clips in the playoffs when they went 5 out by being completely unable to stop dribble penetration forcing Gobert to either concede the layup or the corner three. But generally in the regular szn they had a a terrific defense entirely because of how good he was at deterring shots at the rim
"Gobert definitely orchestrates. It's just that guys like Bojan and Mitchell don't like playing defense, so Rudy has to literally push them into the correct spots."
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Pretty much looking like Rudy Gobert vs. Draymond Green right now.
Rudy Gobert is having a hell of a season. I think the Olympics really helped him out.
Rudy gobert
LeBron is an excellent Giannis defender and Rudy Gobert locks down the paint. Who's guarding Steph AND Dame?

I cannot be dissuaded from the idea that if Rudy Gobert was on the lakers he would've been in top 5 defender all time conversations beginning several years ago.
"Rudy Gobert; “A voice from behind me gurgles, ‘Boy that popcorn tastes good a second time.’ I turn around to say ‘Yeah, I bet it does.’ I turn around and this guy is puking everywhere… I absolutely choked, I am not joking, I turned around and he was smiling. He was smiling while he was throwing up.”"
"That’s the thing, he was the fastest fish in a small pond. Don’t mean shit in the ocean with the guys he has to go against in the NBA. That shit ain’t gonna work on guys like Embiid, Rudy Gobert of even Bam (just meaning he’s undersized compared to the other two)."

"I thought about what rudy gobert said last time. Isaiah did nothing when he had a chance, then acted all bad boy and shit once ppl got between them"
So wait a gentle embrace from Rudy Gobert isn't what would happen?
"Not always. I'm my experience with the Sixers subreddit they'll be more likely to brag about their guy doing something like that, and some of the more level headed fan bases can acknowledge that their guy isn't always right.  I get that sports are tribal as a motherfucker, but I literally named my account after Rudy Gobert and when that motherfucker pulled his stunt with the microphones I didn't pretend nothing happened. He's not a magically perfect being just because I like the way he plays basketball.  We accept that fan bases will defend their guys even when they do something that's obviously dangerous and against the rules, but we really shouldn't. Supporting a sports team does not require that you be a fucking idiot."
Rudy Gobert somewhere turning off his phone
"Before I address this, did you read my post?  You stated that **all** advanced metrics rate Duncan superior to Kobe. I listed several that show the opposite (RAPTOR, WOWYR, OBPM). That alone invalidated your point, because you spoke in absolutes.   Also, the only point I was trying to make was that advanced statistics are split on Kobe and Duncan. I even acknowledged that you could repeat this exercise with statistics that show Duncan &gt; Kobe…so it wasn’t necessary to go ahead and list this all out, but I appreciate the effort.  Few things worth pointing out:  1) A lot of what you listed (PER, WS) are really outdated and not even worth listing anymore. Rudy Gobert trumps Tim Duncan in many of those statistics lol, so not sure what the takeaway is there.  2) You also sneakily extended your list by practically repeating the same things twice (WS and WS/48, and then again with BPM and VORP).  3) BPM is a composite of OBPM and DBPM, and DBPM is notoriously shotty and even worse than OBPM. That said, OBPM lists Kobe as superior (4.6 to 3.3) and DBPM lists Duncan as superior. Which makes sense, as Kobe was the more impactful offensive player and Duncan was the more impactful defender.  4) The listing of the TS% is notoriously misleading and fails to encapsulate the proper context. Both players had a TS+ of 104, meaning across their careers, they shot 4% higher than the average player in terms of TS. The difference? Kobe was a high-volume scorer, who peaked at 35 PPG and won 2 scoring titles, whereas Duncan peaked at 25 PPG and never shot above that mark more than once.  Also, Duncan might have the higher playoff TS% by a hair, but again, Kobe was higher volume and his RELATIVE true shooting was higher once you account for defenses faced.   Kobe’s playoff rTS was +2.54%. Duncan’s was +2.28%."
"Rudy Gobert on if he'd ever seen Zion eating an entire rack of ribs before: ""No, first time.. life is full of surprises.   I hope he's ok.  I actually made eye contact with him.  He was smiling.  He was smiling and shoveling food in at the same time"""

"I have a theory that this guy may have done it one purpose. Like he told his friends he had court side and bet he could throw up on TV.  Because he doesn't even attempt to hide himself or even move, despite knowing he's on national TV. According to the Rudy Gobert quote he was smiling the entire time.  Having worked in bars and once joined a college fraternity, I've seen a lot of people drink until they spewed. Usually it isn't followed by sitting in the same place smiling, knowing everyone is watching, unless the person is soooo drunk that they are starting to fall over and pass out."
just crazy imagining this guy staring at dreamy 7 foot french superstar rudy gobert grinning like a drunk moron while vomit gurgles out of his mouth  so bizarre

"Didn't watch the game, did Rudy Gobert really attempt a three pointer?"
"As of right now the Wolves don't have an allstar. LeBron and AD will both make the allstar game, even if the Lakers are barely above .500, which will take away the possible frontcourt spot KAT could get. Guard is way too freaking deep for Edwards to make it, and as you can see from this breakdown, there will be an overflow of guards into the wildcard spots, making it so the bare mininum of 6 frontcourt players make it.   **Starters**  * Stephen Curry * Luka Doncic * LeBron James * Anthony Davis * Nikola Jokic  **Reserves**  * G - Donovan Mitchell * G - Chris Paul * F - Paul George * F - Draymond Green * F - Rudy Gobert * W - Devin Booker * W - Ja Morant"
Rudy gobert
"This is true to an extent, but it severely lacks context which in my opinion brings the overall value of the whole metric down. Like taking Gobert for instance, its undeniably true he's a highly efficient scorer, but just looking at his box-score values wouldn't show that over 3/4 of his shots are assisted. Despite being efficient, there's little on-ball shot creation from Rudy himself, which doesn't translate into the PER value. Imo It's a disingenuous behavior trying to boil all this information down into a single number, which is compared across every player in the league regardless of position or other contextual factors"
"they are. its a stat that attempts to divvy up credit for the success of a team. that is inherently a flawed. If you dont think thats flawed, then consider that Rudy Gobert in 2019 had a higher WS/48 season than all but one from Magic and all from Kobe."

"Yeah again, the move itself isn’t difficult. It just leads to a shot/ exists in a context that is difficult. Like, dribbling toward the basket is easy, but hitting a layup over Rudy Gobert is hard. That doesn’t make the dribbling part hard too."
"&gt;Kobe is an 8-15 guy ... only gets fringe top 10 recognition because he won so much. His career OBPM ... points to more of a top 20 guy than a top 10 guy  Career OBPM puts TMac and Dame Lillard over Kobe; it's like ranking guys by career TS% and declaring Rudy Gobert the GOAT.  There may be an argument for Kobe just outside the top 10, but 15 is ridiculous. There's a better case for Kobe at #5 than there is for Kobe at #15."
"Look at team G.Paul George,Draymond Green and Rudy Gobert."
"Based on your response, Rudy Gobert is still one of the most underrated players in the NBA. Gobert is a better scorer than Draymond and that’s just a fact, there’s no metric by which you can argue otherwise."
"Basically the entire offensive scheme relies on pick and rolls with Gobert and kick-outs to shooters on the perimeter if it doesn't work.  Look at the [highlights of the last Hawks game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD4PEmdyTEI) vs the [highlights of the last Jazz game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVITmKho_K8). The Jazz tried some new stuff with Rudy Gay on the floor (he has size nobody else has) but aside from a couple plays with him, Rudy screens and rolls in pretty much every single non-transition play.  His roll gravity is what opens up our shooters. Without him, nothing we do works."
"Conley’s impact this year has really shown up when you look at the lineups. The Jazz essentially runs three different groups each half- the starters, then a Mitchell-Whiteside led group, A Rudy-Conley group-Mitchell-Whitside again and then the starters to finish.  That third group so far has basically always had Rudy Gobert, Eric Paschall (though probably now Rudy Gay), Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson. The difference between have Conley with that group vs anyone else is staggering. These are the lineups with those 4 (Rudy Pashcall Ingles Clarkson)  Conley- +11.3 net rtg (113 min)  Butler -4.3 net rtg (21 min)  Forest -12.7 net rtg (21 min)   Mitchell -64 net rtg (8 min)  Conley’s ability to floor general that unit in particular is so incredibly valuable."
"Conley and Ingles are really the only guys that actively look for Rudy. Mitchell in particular has always been awful at getting Gobert the ball down low, and that actually caused a lot of tension in the locker room about 1-2 months before COVID hit. Rudy even had a 3-4 game stretch of basically on court protesting his own players not feeding him the ball.   The whole team needs to just dump it to Rudy inside whenever he’s got someone small, because 60% of the time the defender panics and fouls Gobert within 2 seconds of the catch. If they don’t Rudy can just dump it back out again."
"&gt; Centers are notorious for peaking their rookie years because the position is so easy  14 pts, 8 reb, 1 ast - Anthony Davis' ""peak"" rookie season.   10 pts, 7 reb, 2 ast - Nikola Jokic's ""peak"" rookie season.   7 pts, 6 reb, 2 ast - Bam Adebayo  2 pts, 3 reb, 1 blk - Rudy Gobert  6 pts, 5 reb, 1 ast - Nikola Vucevic  6 pts, 5 reb, 1 blk - Serge Ibaka  4 pts, 5 reb, 1 blk - Deandre Jordan  3 pts, 3 reb, 1 blk - Clint Capela  2 pts, 1 reb - Thomas Bryant  3 pts, 4 reb, 1 blk - Steven Adams"
"This is why I have no problem with how he’s spoken about Rudy Gobert. Gobert gets paid more than ~98% of the league. He’d better play like it. Yes, he’s a DPOY but Utah can not and will not win a title this way.  Shaq, of all people in NBA history, understands the pressure of being a big fish in a small (or medium sized) pond. If you get all the money and accolades, you can’t keep blaming everyone else for not winning it all; at some point you have to accept why people clap back at you  Exactly that applies to James Harden, who has had the Rockets franchise catered to his every whim for 8 years and somehow it’s still not enough and it’s still everyone else’s fault they couldn’t win. Once again, they gave him what he wanted but there’s an even greater level of expectation - like what KD himself perceived to be a slight - because there are really no more excuses this time"
Rudy gobert
"AD, Lebron, Giannis, Luka, Kawhi, Dame, Steph, Harden, Butler, Tatum, Westbrook, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul,  Paul George, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Andre Drummond."
"Rudy Gobert got DPOY 5 years in and All NBA Defensive Team first team in 4 years.  Giannis is 7 years for DPOY and All NBA Defensive Team second team in 4 years.  Kawhi is 4 and 3 years.   Draymond is 5 and 3 years.  So, yeah, Luka could peak defensively in the next 2 years."
But what if you get Rudy Gobert??
"of course, though I think Rudy gobert could be described as a prominent figure in the nba world, not just a Twitter egg."
"Let's not get this twisted, Houston Rockets are the winners here without a doubt. 8 draft picks, AND Vixtor Oladipo. Please understand, Kevin Durant is dropping 30 points every playoff game, but Unless he becomes a huge defensive threat, this team seems destined to come up short. Yes they can score at will. Yes they can probably shoot you to death, but they just traded away the man who glued their defense together, Jarret Allen. That man never had a silent game, he is so Rudy Gobert-like in the sense that even without him reaching for it he affects shots. AND HE'S ONLY 22! The Nets are laying down all their hopes on how well DeAndre Jordan and KD can defend the paint. KD will of course be playing the 4 or the 3 most of the time.  You're betting all your money that DeAndre Jordan is going to defend Embiid, Giannis, Bam and the Boston forwards. Back to back to back, then go on to defend against Anthony Davis.  People, DJ was outstanding in LA, but now they're asking him to be DPOY over all these other great and young bigs.  Unless more changes are coming, this just seems like a great 2021 regular season team! They'd have to sell kyrie just to afford more salary space!  TLDR: Houston Rockets are the winners of the trade and could potentially be favorites over Brooklyn next season."
"&gt; The difference with Giannis is he can and will semi-regularly be put on guys like LeBron, Kawhi, PG etc. Gobert is never doing that and is largely incapable of all that.  Is he incapable? That just isn't our defesnive system is all, If we ask Rudy to guard those guys then who is guarding the other team's big? We don't have another big to turn to unless we go with a Gobert/Favors lineup which historically hasn't worked for us on the offensive end. I don't think we should assume Gobert cannot defend those guys just because it's not the defensive system our coach uses. Also, while it doesn't happen often, the few times we have put Gobert on those guys he has pretty much smothered them, so I really don't think that part of your argument is valid. We both know Giannis has more quickness than Gobert, so of course he will be better in isolation but that's one aspect of his defensive game and Gobert is still a much bigger factor for his team, which is the most important part of individual's defense in my opinion. How much does he improve his team? They both improve their teams tremendously, and overall Gianis improves the Bucks more than Gobert improves the Jazz, but on the defensive end, Gobert has the bigger impact and that makes him the better defender. Who cares what they can do in a vacuum, basketball isn't played in a vacuum."
"Don't forget about Rudy ""supermax"" Gobert"
no I mean the situation isn't there is another hour they're socializing with the other team its its 10 minutes at most. The only person who is pretending to be an expert on viral spread is you. This rule is entirely arbitrary and is merely the NBA seeming like they're doing something to justify continuing the season. I'm waiting for a big name like Rudy Gobert to get sick again and the season gets cancelled because its kind of inevitable at this point.
"Ok, if he want to extend it to Ben Simmons's career (or any single season, they're all about the same), he averages 16 points on slightly above average efficiency, while being totally unable to threaten to score outside the paint. Is that great scoring? Is Rudy Gobert, who's much more efficient on the same volume and profile, a great scorer? What about Clint Capella?"
The nba didn’t do shit to help show how dangerous covid was this wasn’t some benevolent act once Rudy gobert had it you HAD to shut down there was no choice. They prolonged it as long as they could till then they still wanted to have as many fans as possible. Everything was driven by $$ just like any other time
"The NBA is really falling short on common sense areas right now.   1. Space out the games more. You get these mass breakouts because teams are playing 3-4 times per week. One infection can spread to several teams very quickly. The NBA should know this because of the first Rudy Gobert outbreak.    When games are packed too tightly together, the virus spreads quicker.  2. Have the tests in earlier. A huge chunk of the current covid cases / potential covid cases come from Seth Curry (not that it's his fault). Seth was playing sick and they pulled him midway through the game because they got a positive test result.    The question the NBA needs to ask is, why was Seth playing if his results hadn't come back yet?  3. Be more honest and realistic about who is at risk. Bradley Beal had to isolate because he spoke to Tatum at the end of the game and Tatum ended up being positive. If Beal speaking to Tatum is enough to put Beal at risk then everyone on the Celtics should be considered at risk too, because they've all spoken to Tatum and shared a huddle with him during the game.    Right now the NBA is trying to isolate as few as possible and it's clearly not working.   None of this is rocket science. The world has had a year to learn about and understand this virus. This is simple shit."
He's no pre-bubble Rudy Gobert. That dude shut down the entire nba!
"I’ll probably be downvoted for saying this since I’m a Jazz fan, but oh well. Here goes..:  If we’re measuring overall defensive impact, Turner is not a better defensive center than Gobert. Gobert has the highest defensive RAPTOR by a significant margin. Turner is 5th.  Should Turner be in conversation for DPoY? Absolutely. But let’s not act like he’s all of a sudden the best defensive center when defensive metrics still have Rudy significantly above all other centers"
"Rudy Gobert, Giannis"
"The diskussion should not be if Jokic is better than embiid cause its obvious, rather is embiid as good as Rudy Gobert? Debatable.  Jokic is much better. Jokic first team All nba while embiid was second team, last season, Jokic second team All nba while embiid was not even third team. That was Gobert. So the NBA officially ranks Gobert over embiid."
"He's still gonna get all that as shown by literally every disgruntled star the last two or three years, culminating with nothing happening to Harden and Rudy Gobert getting a giant fat check after basically shutting the league down (was happening no matter what, don't need that conversation, but he was still an asshole).  Kyrie is VP of the union that shows the players they can do whatever they want, whenever they want.  Iggy sat out the entire season until he was traded and is a VP.  Kyrie won't face any reprucussions and if he does, it will just be days missed and not being paid for those days. Oh no.  He didn't get paid for the work he refused to do, just like literally anyone else.  That's not punishment.  Other people would be fired.  He needs to pay money out of pocket in addition to being suspended this season (if it keeps up, right now he should just be docked the days he's missed and told to get the fuck back on the court and if he isn't by ___ then he's suspended the rest of the reason and contract terminated or whatever the Nets want."
And people say Rudy Gobert is getting paid too much.
"&gt; You’re just wrong and don’t understand basketball.  &gt; It’s evident most people on the sub are ignorant about the nba.  &gt; It’s 2021. Offense is valued over defense.  &gt; Let’s play a game here of what would you rather have with health not being a factor:  &gt; Rudy Gobert or Kristaps Porzingis?  &gt; Rudy Gobert or Vucevic?  &gt; Rudy Gobert or KAT?  &gt; You take each of these centers over Gobert based on overall skillset.  &gt; Gobert is considered a better defender than all of them, yet we wall know he’s worse than all of these centers because he’s complete ass on offense.  &gt; Being highly skilled on offense and below average on defense is by far more valued than highly skilled on defense and below average on offense. Also, all the centers I listed aren’t terrible on defense either, just slightly worse or moderately worse than how Gobert is perceived.  &gt; Come playoff time, Gobert and every other unskilled offensive big man are useless on offense and a huge liability.  &gt; The Deandre Jordan/Dwight Howard centers are a thing of the past now.  So people know what this tantrum post is in reference to. This dude is upset that I didn't agree with him."
Imagine Rudy Gobert infecting Donavon Mitchell again
Nah Rudy gobert still
"Good. If this is all true, fuck Kyrie Irving.  Remember the statement he released last month when he decided to stop talking to the media?  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nets-kyrie-irving-releases-a-statement-instead-of-talking-to-media-ahead-of-season/  &gt;COVID-19 has impacted us all in many ways, so I pray for the safety and health of our communities domestically and abroad. I am truly excited for the season to start and I am also praying that everyone remains safe and healthy throughout this journey.  &gt;Instead of speaking to the media today, I am issuing this statement to ensure that my message is conveyed properly.  &gt;I am committed to show up to work everyday, ready to have fun, compete, perform, and win championships alongside my teammates and colleagues in the Nets organization. My goal this season is to let my work on and off the court speak for itself.  &gt;Life hit differently this year and it requires us, it requires me, to move differently. So, this is the beginning of that change.   The videos yesterday show all those words are bullshit  Rudy Gobert got crucified for not taking COVID seriously when he touched mics last year.  This was before the NBA shutdown and before the country sheltered in place as a whole.    1 year later, we're all suppose to know better but this asshole is out at a super spreader event, where most of the people there have no mask on and are not practicing social distancing protocols.    Irving not taking COVID seriously is going to eventually shut down the NBA again."
Do you think if we transported Rudy Gobert to the 60s than he'd be spoken about like a mythical GOAT defender like we do with Bill Russell?
This comment wrecked my mind with the time warp this past year has been. Rudy Gobert touching microphones feels like yesterday

What is the joke? That your response to the team with the douchiest players in the league doesn’t count because you think Rudy Gobert causes the covid shutdown that every professional sport also experienced? It’s either stupid or dumb. Probably both.
Then we're gonna get a post about how Brandon Ingram dropped 50 on Rudy Gobert's head with the whole sub following the narrative until one person actually bothers to look and realizes Gobert held Ingram to 0-6 and a turnover when defending him
Yes Rudy Gobert is the reason covid exists. Hot take.
He’d slap Rudy Gobert with his dong dunking on Rudys face. Nobody stopping Wilt. Games soft as hell today too so he’d man handle all these dudes
Patty Mills is front runner for 6MOTY (Clarkson not far behind)  If Steph keeps doing Steph things I can see him winning MVP  Rudy Gobert is quietly putting in another DPOY level season  LaMelo will win ROTY  Randle for MIP  *these predictions could all change in a week
&gt;Although rudy gobert getting 200m really screws over the market for big guys  I think you mean bigs should be sending thank you cards to Rudy for their upcoming oversized contracts
"Yes, you're right but I just wanted to point out how misleading that was and how it wasn't received that way. It was clearly posted just to shit on Gobert and just not the reality of what really happened. Rudy guarded him 59% of the time so yes he was his primary defender. However, 20 of his 30 points came while guarded by others. He shot 28.6% while guarded by Gobert and 50% while guarded by everybody else"
"He is hard to find a comp for me. He has really good defense and is up there with Bam and some others as best perimeter defending big man which is crazy because he is 7'0"". His rebounding is great. I have yet to find any centers that are as bad as he is was at getting to the line. His ball handling isn't good as well. I think he is going to be like that Enes Kanter and Derrick Favors hybrid that Jazz fans wished they had early in both of their careers before they had Rudy Gobert. Enes Kanter on offense and Favors on defense."
I think he will get close to those numbers but not quite get there  Although rudy gobert getting 200m really screws over the market for big guys
He’s playing more of a Rudy Gobert type of role for us this season. A lot of his impact isn’t showing on the stat sheet but he’s been the anchor to our defense.
Anyone remember when Rudy gobert got punked by eric gordon and pj tucker last year lol
"“But Rudy Gobert’s contract, I should get paid $1 billion dollars if he’s getting $200m”  -Shaq  You’ve done some nice analysis, Gobert isn’t incredibly skilled offensively but he continuously finds a way to play towards his strengths as a roll man."
"Dude, 10 months ago the whole league went crazy when Rudy Gobert touched a bunch of mics when he had Covid, now you've got guys with Covid touching other guys hands who are then immediately touching their face and you're acting like that's not a big deal.  Embiid has decided to quarantine himself from his family out of precaution but the league doesn't care."
"At this rate has to be bubble, or people can enjoy watching G league game on national TV lol. Rudy Gobert one positive shutdown whole NBA, now back to back positive in same team, and NBA still want them to play..... Risky gamble. Just look at celtics, now Tatum is out , they basically gutted the whole starting lineup."
Rudy Gobert is nodding his head approvingly somewhere

He fouled the shit out of Rudy Gobert while trying to get the rebound.....  Don't start playing dirty Giannis.....
imagine 4 years ago someone told u gordon hayward was gonna make less than rudy gobert lol
Rudy Gobert hasn’t. He can hit them decently in practice but I don’t think he’s ever attempted one in an actual game
"and with all that spacing available to him, Rudy Gobert feasted, going for 9 points on 44 fg%"
"No no no, you see, ""Baguette Biyombo"" is Shaq's derogatory nickname for Rudy Gobert. This is the actual Biyombo."
"Imagine: You're about to take a 3 point shot, but then, RUDY GOBERT COMES A'RUNNIN RIGHT ATCHA"
"No, they are pretty useless on offense without their respective skills, such as footwork and touch around the rim. See: Rudy Gobert"
"Does this sound like a lottery team to you?  Rudy Gobert, Joe Ingles, Ricky Rubio, Jae Crowder, Dante Exum, Derrick Favors, Rodney Hood, Joe Johnson.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2018.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2018.html)"
"To that point, players like Rudy Gobert and Michael Porter Jr. have made far more destructive comments against science than Kyrie has with his flat Earth crap."
"You’re like a parrot bro, you hear that Rudy gobert fact and you just repeat it back to everyone you see. Like the other guy said, mike Conley had the biggest contract in the league at one point. The nba is a bit more complicated than best player=best contract"
"Rudy Gobert started covid in the league and then they paid him $200m for it, the Jazz are def the most unlikeable team. 🤦‍♂️"
"To preface this... He's great, but not a supermax type player, and no one was talking supermax, but him. If I were ownership, I'd have countered their offer, and told him that we needed one more key piece. Now he needs to up his game, or something has to fall your way with that contract taking 1/3rd of the salary cap.    https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2129708936860/utah-jazz-star-rudy-gobert-receives-five-year-205-million-extension ""For me, my goal is to always win a championship,"" Gobert told ESPN. ""When we spoke with my agent before the negotiations started, I decided that I didn't want to ask for the supermax. We didn't want to start the negotiations by asking for the supermax. For me, it was important to show to the organization and show to the team that it wasn't about money. It was about continuing to build what we've been building and also give this team and give myself the stability and the peace of mind to not have to deal with the negotiations later."""
Definitely depends on the teams goals. If all I'm trying to do is make the playoffs set me up with the best rim protector available and I'll ride that into a first or second round loss. If I'm a championship level team then being able to switch in the highest leverage games is more important so having a rudy gobert or brook lopez type is going to be less appealing.
"I'm OOTL, why does everyone hate Rudy Gobert?"
"If you don’t know how good Rudy gobert is or how impactful he is for the Jazz, you don’t know basketball"
"But Rudy gobert is most certainly playing to his contract. Shaq isn’t just wrong, he’s a big insecure baby"
"Who is saying that Rudy Gobert is anywhere near the same level player as Shaq?  Salaries have gotten higher since Shaq played, should Rudy have turned down the contract because he’s not as good as Shaq was?  There is no point to what Shaq is saying, it’s just straight up rude and unnecessary"
"""Enmity ended with Rudy Gobert. Now Jokic is my worst enemy."""
The 3rd highest contract *in NBA history* belongs to Rudy Gobert. I think that should live in everyone’s head rent free
Rudy Gobert is so dead right now. Getting shots back and forth from these two
"Yeah, Rudy Gobert shouldn’t have taken a max! At very best if he really wanted to win he should’ve have taken the minimum he could have gotten so the jazz would have been able to sign a better player  Smh bro nobody in their right mind is going to turn down money like that and criticising Gobert for it is stupid  If you are eligible for money like that you’re damn right to take it- he didn’t even get the max anyways and I’m pretty sure 99.99% of the population would do the same no matter how much they criticise Gobert now"
Rudy Gobert was pretty good in Clash Royale apparently
"This was funny at first to see Shaq flame someone again, but at this point Rudy Gobert is living in this man’s head."
"Gobert's impact is massive but he got that contract because of he had all the leverage in negotiations. The only party who was gonna come out of it worse off was the Jazz, just depended on which poison they wanted to pick.  Jazz lets him walk in free agency, they are fucked because they just gave away a DPOY for nothing. If Gobert joins a West team, double fucked for the Jazz.  Jazz trades him, they won't get much of a return if other teams are concerned that Rudy Gobert might bolt after a year. Also no guarantee of them being able to find a replacement either via draft or free agency  Jazz extends him? They nuke their cap sheet to hell if they gave him the supermax he was qualified for, as it is they got him to leave some money on the table. So they are still not in a great position cap-wise, but at least it could be worse."
Cannot believe Rudy fucking Gobert is in Shaq's head rent free lmao
"So last years Denver vs Jazz series had the Chad Nikola Jokic vs the Virgin Rudy Gobert.  By the way, no offense intended towards Gobert or Utah fans, just a joke."
"Na. LeVert was already really good in the Jazz game. He played himself out of his early season funk. Allen literally dominated Rudy Gobert. Harris is good, too. They were even better with Kyrie in that game."
should rudy gobert or steven adams take a wide open 3? Is that a good shot?
"Rudy Gobert got over 200 millions because of his defence. No offence, but I don't think its his screen assists that got him that contract. And Btw bertans is much much better and more valuable than Kris Dunn."
No one has ever said he'd be an all-star. But he is 1.6 blocks per game better than anyone else in the league at the moment. More than double everyone but Rudy Gobert
I would swap out Vucevic for Rudy Gobert.
"I find him really tough to evaluate.  The talent is definitely there but it feels like his impact comes and goes.  There are times when Rudy Gobert getting 3 blocks feels more impactful than Myles Turner getting 6 because Rudy does a better job of altering the shots he doesn't block.   It was a big concept with Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. They could both get 8 blocks a game, but people would walk away from games incredibly impressed by all the shots Bill altered without getting the block (especially early in Wilt's career).  His first game against Boston for the season, Myles had 5 blocks and Boston still shot 50% from the field. It just felt like, ""yeah he had the blocks, but we still pretty much got the shots we wanted"". Whereas Rudy having a big night is like putting up a sign that says ""sorry, this part of the court is closed"".  Myles certainly isn't a pure stat-padder like Whiteside (who can lead the league in blocks as a NET negative defender), he's definitely had periods of dominance, but it doesn't feel like a consistent dominance.   There are games where Myles gets a lot of blocks and he suffocates the offence. Then there are games where he gets a lot of blocks and the offence keeps chugging along as if nothing's happened."
"Yeah it is. That’s not to say Rudy didn’t struggle a little bit when pulled out to the perimeter because he did, but without a Gobert level rim protector Randle likely would have had at least 40"

"Let’s face it. In a year’s time, people gonna look at this contract and it’s effects on the available roster moves and assess it for what it really means: “how many games did Rudy Gobert win for the Jazz, and did his contract bring the org closer to its goals?” So far, regardless of his “unquantifiable” impact, he’s letting opposing bigs have big numbers and his team has lost both of those games. He should get clowned. He’ll face worse when he gets Blake Griffin status in a year or two."
"I recommend picking a stat or action and watching how each play is set up to accommodate and facilitate it. The NBA has a lot of ""Pick and Roll"" type plays for instance. Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz is one of the most physical and effective screen-setting centers in the league. A lot of a team's strategy during a play is based on how a screen is set-up, executed, and how the ball moves as a result. Another way to look at games is by focusing on defenses and how they are responding to the other team. Can you guess if the defense is playing zone or man? When will teams use a full-court press? Where are the help defenders? How far past the perimeter will they pursue shooters and ball-handlers? Can you tell if a team is trying to ""hide"" a defender? Can you see if there are certain players defenses will ""cheat"" off of?  It is a fun and exciting game to watch, enjoy."
I don't think Rudy gobert contract was worth 700 billions
"Zach Levine, Booker, Lonzo, Aaron Gordon and Rudy Gobert."
I still won't forgive the Nets for drafting him over Rudy Gobert. I've never been a fan of any Plumlee (except Marshall- he's cool)
Fuck Rudy Gobert
"I’m biased, but pretty solid is underselling his defensive performance throughout his career. He’s been fantastic, the best defending big man outside of rudy gobert"
Imagine paying Rudy Gobert the max and convincing yourself its worth it
Rudy Gobert got paid $205 million just to let Austin Rivers drag his nuts across his face
"""worst trip to NY ever"" - Rudy Gobert, probably"
Austin Rivers is tonight’s “Who made Rudy Gobert look like a trash bum” just 1 night after Jarrett Allen took the honors
Rudy Gobert is a fucking bum btw let me make that very clear
Wonder if Myles will be allowed to win the Rudy Gobert award
"This is the same thing that made him great.  Shaq used to look around at the centers in the league and shit on them because they weren't as good as him. Today Shaq looks around the leauge and still shits on centers because they still aren't as good as him.    In my opinion people need to stop making an issue of this. Respect from the greats doesn't come easy and it shouldn't.   The things Shaq did in his career didn't come easy...as far as I'm concerned he can call Rudy Gobert soft and overpaid as much as he wants. People had alot to say about Shaq when he was playing, he proved them wrong."
Rudy Gobert?
Shaq is so weirdly insecure for a legend of his caliber. No one even has him and gobert in the same stratosphere but he saw Rudy get paid and got threatened
"It's childish and it sucks. Shaq can have an opinion, but he shouldn't be attacking Rudy Gobert to this level. I don't find it funny at all. I find it pathetic."
"Yeah, Rudy is a max level player and he got paid like what, $2m more than the max a year? When Utah was already over the cap after re-signing JC? Utah would have had like $17m in cap if they let Gobert walk as a free agent, there's no player as good as Rudy that you could get for that low of a price.  He's a little overpaid, but you compare him with what they'd be getting to replace him if he walked and it's not even close."
"...... Do you really think he's not trying to insult Rudy gobert here??And the sentiment isnt the same, one is shouting out his culture and hyping him up, the other is using a dumb French stereotype to put him down."
"&gt; I never said there weren’t still bad FT shooters.   You literally said they ""died off"".  &gt; Today, there’s atleast 7 over 80% In 2001-02, not a single center over 80%. You will get 2-3 that are (make sure you check attempts please)over 80% here and there. But not the consistence of today’s basketball.   And in 1980, you had 5 centers shooting 80+% from the line, plus 4 guys listed as power forwards who were big enough to play center today.  In 1985, you had 6 centers at 80+%, plus 8 guys listed as power forwards who were big enough to be 5s in today's game.  &gt; Mind you I only used FT as an example, we can go into alllll the other stats if you want. Centers are really about rebounding and Defense. Like Rudy Gobert   During the 20th century, centers won the NBA MVP award more often than not. 27 times in 45 seasons.  That doesn't include players like Bob McAdoo, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, and Larry Bird, all of whom might be stretch 5s if they played today.  &gt;And the sport was compleeetely different back when Bob Pettit played.(Like how they jump balled after each basket...yes, you read that correctly   I know, I actually played some jump-ball-after-each-basket games.  I'm not quite that old, but I did once have a weird gym teacher who insisted that was the proper way the game should be played.  &gt;But he was one of the freaks of his age. Are you trying to tell me he was the average?  Are you claiming Nowitzki and Porzingis are?  &gt; Garnett/lDuncan set the standard of PF’s today   This makes me doubt that you know half as much as you seem to think you do.  Duncan was the prototype center, circa 1965.  Outside 3', Duncan was a mediocre shooter at best -- 45% out to 10', and 40% between 10 and the arc.  Garnett, by comparison, shot 45% out the arc, and was actually semi-threatening beyond it, at least for his era -- meaning he broke 30% from 3 a couple times."
"Clarkson is pretty high, but Mike is actually far above even the other players on his own team. Rudy Gobert is second with 187."
"Utah Jazz general manager Justin Zanik proudly waited outside the locker room after the final buzzer to give Rudy Gobert and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Wednesday evening. Injured guard Donovan Mitchell yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Bojan Bogdanović gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Mike Conley yelled out, “We got a \[expletive\] squad now.” And before Gobert hit the locker room door, former NBA great Carlos Boozer hugged him and said, “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.”"
Gobert definitely doesn’t dominate AD. AD had struggled scoring in the paint against him but then adjusted to a more perimeter focused game that absolutely burned Rudy.
In 2000 Shaq averaged 38/17 in the finals with two 20 rebound games.  In 2001 Shaq averaged 33/16 in the finals with two 20 rebound games.  In 2003 Shaq averaged 25/14 in the finals with another 20 rebound game.  Rudy Gobert literally has never grabbed 20 rebounds in a playoff game. Salty Utah fans mass downvoting me when I’m right.
"Definitely the fans  I highly doubt Donovan is losing sleep over what Shaq, yet fans STILL bring it up till this day  They also pick and choose who to defend against Shaq. It wasn’t really a problem when he ridiculed Rudy Gobert and posted an IG pic of him dunking on Gobert, it was instead “savage”, now all of a sudden he crossed the line with Mitchell"
"Well Kristaps is one of five vertebrates on earth with a higher center of gravity than Rudy Gobert, with the other four being Masai Giraffes. It's just a good matchup"
Rudy Gobert: 29 pts 20 rebounds 3 steals and 3 blocks.  Shaq on Instagram: LOL!!! Did you see Rudy get absolutely posterized by Kristaps?!?!? That bum can't play defense.
Actually didn’t care for gobert much but since Shaq went at him for no reason I cheer for the Rudy gobert
&gt;Gobert is one of a select few players who you can find constantly hunting for Offensive Rebounds even when he isn't getting offensive touches.  Its really funny that you've noticed that bcz it's the perfect example of Rudy excelling at something that he's not focused on bcz he's just.that.good
"Shaquille O'Neal does not validate this game. Rudy Gobert was too strong yesterday ...  Gobert sticks to his role with Jazz, but when he is given more balls on offense, he is able to do much more than his usual point statistics indicate.  Sorry Shaq."
"Eh you could argue that any of Conley, Mitchell or Gobert has been our best player and have a valid argument. To me it’s Rudy by a decent margin but you can’t win MVP scoring 15 ppg. Wouldn’t be surprised if Gobert finished top 5 or so getting a bunch of 4th and 5th place votes."
For years Rudy Gobert has been statistically been the best isolation defender in the league. We didn’t struggle against the warriors and rockets because of the all the 3 point shooting but because our offense dies against switch everything defenses. It negates a lot of the complicated screen actions Snyder likes to run.
"Not enough people understand this. Looking at Rudy Gobert for example, his box scores rarely pop out, but his overall impact on the game is absurd if you actually watch."
"It’s crazy, I see people getting upvoted in here literally saying Rudy Gobert doesn’t even know how to play basketball. One thing I cannot stand is people who have these strong ass opinions on something they don’t know anything about 😂"
"I mean the best way is to watch a team and then find one that you enjoy watching.   My personal recommendation would be the Utah Jazz. They've been in an awkward middle stage these past few years. Not bad, but not really contending. Either first or second round playoff exits. But this year they've started to connect all the pieces. One of the most exciting young stars in the league in Donovan Mitchell, a 2x defense player of the year in Rudy Gobert, memes galore in Ingles and Niang. They just got a new owner this year with money and is willing to spend to make this team great. Not to mention, we're on a hot streak right now playing the best basketball in the NBA, but by no means would you be a bandwagon for following the jazz. Dope uniforms, fun players, and a mastermind coach. We got 3s, Dunks, and Defense. Idk what more you'd need.  Other than that I'd probably say the Grizzlies. I just like Já Morant."
Even though he's overpaid doesn't mean it's not surprising. Rudy Gobert doesn't do much on the offensive side except P&amp;R so to see him score that much is surprising and unexpected.
"That's Rudy friccin Gobert, you heathen."
"I couldn't be happier for a player than I feel for Gobert after that performance!   This stat &amp; story line will be a ""narrative changer"" for Gobert.  It's an eye popping line on the one night Mitchell was out.   It'll say what we already know, that Rudy is a great offensive player, he just doesn't need to score to be most effective for the team."
Rudy Gobert with the epic *fuck you!* game to the haters!
The amount of players dying on Gobert screens tonight was mind-boggling. Rudy isn't always gonna score this many points but he just impacts the game so much on both ends. Truly the most underappreciated star player in the league.
"Don't let this distract you from the fact that Gobert is Porzingis' daddy. In 7 career games against Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert has recorded 150 points (21.4ppg) on 55/73 shooting (75%) from the field."
Rudy fu*king Gobert.
Rudy “No Offense” Gobert
"Fun fact: In 7 career games against Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert has recorded 150 points (21.4ppg) on 55/73 shooting (75%) from the field."
Rudy Gobert stats is like prime Shaq LMFAO
rudy gobert looking like he's worth his contract.
#RUDY GOBERT
Rudy Gobert is 7 foot 7 and can take a shotgun blast standing but can't catch a pass on a cut without dropping the ball to his knees and getting it slapped.  EVERY DAMN TIME. Get it high big guy!
I don’t watch a lot of jazz games but holy shit the impact of Rudy Gobert in the paint is devastating. The type of stuff that doesn’t show on the stat sheet can still be the most impactful
Rudy Gobert needs to interfere in the match
Rudy Gobert was All-NBA last year
yeah he was like Rudy Gobert on steroids. Really fun to watch before the back surgeries.
"Gobert is the most underrated all-star in the league, maybe ever.   I've been an NBA fan since the 80's &amp; honestly, Shaq &amp; Hakeem are the only centers I've seen play that impact a game more than Rudy does. Maybe Jokic is on that level too.   He's a one-man defensive system, and his rim-running &amp; screening game are the reason Utah is able to get up the unprecedented volume of open 3's they have for the past few seasons.  Lebron, KD, Harden, Giannis &amp; Kawhi are--in my opinion-- the only players that have a bigger overall positive impact on their team.   He's ridiculously good. It's unfortunate that his impact doesn't show up in traditional stat lines, but damn, the man is so fucking good!"
"Rudy Gobert - overrated. He’s a great interior defender but not very versatile compared to other big men. I feel that his defense is overrated as if u draw him outside of the paint he doesn’t have the same defensive effectiveness as a Giannis or Davis. He doesn’t stretch the floor and can disappear sometimes on offense. He seems very one dimensional - traditional big, which is a dying breed. He’s still a good player but his current contract is huge and doesn’t reflect his impact on the game. I still remember Durant on a podcast saying “I see some guys that won defensive MVP but they are so easy to score on” pretty sure he was referring to Gobert"
also there is one Rudy Gobert-Bourgarel to be considered
"I think statheads are annoying, but at the same time, these stats can be fascinating. For example, if you look at rudy gobert play sometimes he seems lost, but if you look at impact metrics, hes up there with the best of the best.   Someone made a post with a few players and their SD, and it confirmed my though that Grant was one of the more consistent players in the league this season, so far."

Don't forget when Rudy Gobert passed Shaq in career earnings
"&gt; Rudy Gobert is 3rd right behind LeBron btw  Hey Shaq, maybe this is why this man makes so much money huh?"
Rudy Gobert pulled the chair out from under his ass
Because Rudy Gobert is in the paint
"You must have never seen anything but highlights on NBA tv. If you had seen Shaq in his prime, you would know who Rik Smits is. I used to see 10 live games a year from 1990 to present day and one was always a Laker game. I have seen him live more times than I have seen Rudy play live. Shaq didnt have Hakeem moves. He was BIG. I did see him dominate. But Smits was the only Gobert style player in the league at the time. Go back and watch Smits destroy Shaq. Ive seen it with my own eyes. Smits was a type of player Shaq couldnt defend. Plus he was the type of player that defended Shaq almost better than anyone else. I think there is even tape when Shaq retired where he admits that Rik Smits always dominated him."
"Yeah, pretty darn. That won’t do anything for you in the postseason. Have fun with a Rudy Gobert"
"Offense isn’t more important.  Players just do more individually on offense more than they do on defense.  It doesn’t matter how good say Rudy gobert is, James harden can elevate an offense more than he can elevate a defense.  However this isn’t a great argument because Giannis is very good on offense while being one of the best on defense."
"I was at that game! It was AD’s first and only triple double at this point in his career, against Rudy Gobert and the Jazz. The thing that makes this so cool for me, being an NBA fan, is that I got to witness it, and I’m not even from New Orleans. I live in Indiana and am a huge Bulls fan, and a fan of players from Chicago in general. This was like my 3rd ever NBA game that my friends and I just happened to catch while we were in the area for a music festival."
"seriously people roast Jokic for his defense but zion is just fucking awful right now (understandable bc hes a rookie)  the league needs to market jokic, book, mitchell, and and even gobert more before zion as national stars. jokic and rudy will attract more international fans and book is already a fan favorite among youth in the US (not to mention a damn good player)."
Zero player covid deaths. Zero players had to retire because of covid. Zero coaches retired because of covid. Zero nba staff covid deaths. Zero nba referee deaths. Rudy gobert will be known as patient zero and he didnt retire. Dont worry about covid nba deaths.
"No. DPOY isn't just about counting stats and one fucking game isn't going to suddenly catapult him into contention. Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, Joel Embiid, and Anthony Davis are the front runners and I don't see Capela breaking into the top 4, let alone top 3 for the award."
"Nah man, There’s plenty of good ones now, people just use numbers and last names more, these are ones off the top of my head  Spida - Donovan Mitchell  Patient Zero, Stifle Tower, French Connection - Rudy Gobert  Minivan - Georges Niang  Juan Stockton/Spanish Samurai - Ricky Rubio  The Greek Freak  Durantula/Slim Reaper  The Brow  The Beard    Those are pretty cool"
Those guys are not big men though. They are PFs. The forward/center era is re-emerging and teams now need more rim protectors. Allen is averaging a double double on 26 minutes with a block and a chunk with some steals. I easily see him fitting the Rudy Gobert type but less of a liability on offense.  The only Cs I see are Wiseman and Ayton on your list. The rest are either stretch PFs or point forwards.
"""Rudy Gobert needs to apologize for his contract."""
"I've never really loved Shaq on TNT, I love that show because of EJ and Chuck. Shaq is an extremely sensitive &amp; egotistical bully. The guy has a bunch of rings, was on an all time great Laker team, and is easily one of the top guys in the history of the league. With a resume like that, why do you still need to beat up on guys like Rudy Gobert? Or going back even further, all his crap with Javale McGee? That's one of the reasons it's so funny when Chuck says he was just riding the coattails of Kobe or DWade, it gets under his skin immediately every time."
watch your tone when you're talking about rudy gobert LOL
"&gt;Dwight Howard, Javale Mcgee, and Rudy Gobert  All big men who Shaq, as a big man, has this mentality to *dominate* them still.   ""in 1999 Stephen A Smith said to Shaq ""You haven't stepped up yet"" and that motivated to Shaq to play harder. "" &gt;Shaq literally told Mitchell he was trying to motivate him to his face on Inside.  It's different when it's lil guys lol   He likes Giannis and give him the superman title for how aggressive he is so idk he just sounds like Shaq being Shaq to me.."
"Drop the percentage, just count number of wins. That way there is no disadvantage to playing more games at less than full strength.  You should never be penalized for playing more games. And if NBA players are out there getting Covid, that's on them. Who is the bigger problem, Rudy Gobert who got Covid before protocols were put into place or the Player who gets Covid tomorrow? They aren't getting Covid playing the game."
"Shaq is really being constructive when he calls Rudy Gobert a bum and overpaid, that's really actionable advice that he can use to improve his game. Also when he tells Donovan Mitchell that he can't take that next step and that he doesn't know who Christian Wood is. All really great, constructive criticism that totally doesn't come from a negative place.   Also, how tf is LeBron trying to make himself the victim here? This isn't about you bruh"
"It's his job to talk shit to these guys and create pointless drama. If he wasn't working for TNT, he probably wouldn't even care about Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. It's sports entertainment."
It also doesnt mean you will be rudy gobert
They only person shaq should grill is the president of basketball operations for the jazz. Do i think Rudy gobert should be getting more money then anthony davis-fuck no. But shaq shouldn’t be pressing rudy gobert’s teammates about it. Thats on the Utah Jazz’s management so shaq should just leave it at that.
"Fair point. But Gobert got the max, he doesn’t deserve that. Aside from shot blocking I don’t think Drummond and Rudy are that much different of players. I’m sure this is not a popular opinion"
Kenny was saying you wouldn’t be Rudy Gobert aka DPOY if you’re 7ft with base athleticism
"Barkley: ""If you played against Rudy Gobert he'd be blockin' your shot, hitting little kids in the stands!"""
Fuck that Rudy gobert was fucking crying because he wasn’t all NBA he’s a fuckin pussy.  would never say that shit to shaqs face
Shaq got Utah more in their feelings than Vernon Maxwell!  Was he rude to DM? Yes.      Is he a Rudy Gobert hater? Yes.   But Rudy and DM aren't soft
"Yeah, they have different skill sets. And Embiid is amazing. But if I were a GM on most teams, I’d take Jokic over Embiid if I were lucky enough to have that choice to make. What I’m saying isn’t wildly controversial, people debate this all the time, and I readily admit Embiid is an amazing player, so I’m not sure why you’re acting as if I said Wendell Carter Jr is better than Rudy Gobert or some ridiculous shit."
"200 million dollars is living in Shaq's head, and at the moment that money is called ""Rudy Gobert"". Harvard comma intended."
How is shaq to insecure that Rudy gobert getting paid is what drove him over the edge lmao
I used to love shaq cause he was such an amazing player and he is funny  But he has been acting like only his generation was right all others are wrong  Doesn’t even give credit where it’s due  Starts beef with young players like Dwight Howard and Rudy gobert  Both Dwight and Rudy has been way more mature in this situation than shaq ever was
Literally what did you expect to happen when you're like a half foot shorter trying to lay it up against Rudy Gobert. Hart has some balls lol
"Shaq also lied about David Robinson snubbing him for an autograph for years. I just don't trust that he has many of these players best interests at heart at all. Maybe some of the big ones, but his comments about Dwight Howard, Javale Mcgee, and Rudy Gobert to name a few show he's just doing it because he's a dick"
"I don't think it's hypocrisy in this case to say that it's fine for players to get paid what they can, numbers set aside.  Do I think the Jazz made a mistake in offering Gobert a contract that huge considering his style and production? Yes. Do I blame Rudy for taking the contract? Obviously not.  It's not about Rudy being good enough or not, it's about his pretend responsability regarding the money he's being paid. In what world is a player supposed to do the job of the front office and arrange their financial affairs? Not to mention that Rudy isn't as marketable as most American stars, whose financial ""sacrifices"" are dampened by the endorsements they get out of playoff success."

let's put that skill including his worth ethic into the body of Rudy Gobert. how successful is he then?
Conley is playing way better and actually knows how to use Gobert now as opposed to last season when they would bump into each other a bunch of ties. I feel like Rudy has taken a step back and actually works way better with the entire setup as well.
"Fine, I’ll give you that. That’s one time though. He was also an ass about Rudy Gobert crying. Two times.   He doesn’t step outside the game anymore though after that recent incident. He keeps it within the confines of the court (even if he’s not very knowledgeable at all). People still grow in old age."
So? Is Rudy Gobert not a DPOY candidate because he can only guard 4s and 5s?  Should Gary Payton never have won it since he couldn’t have guarded Barkley or Hakeem?
"Career average. But yeah a lot of Centers don't post good career averages.   Shaq himself is 23.7 and 10.9  I mean Demarcus Cousins is at 21 and 10.8. If Cousins stopped playing when he got hurt, he'd have put up better career averages than Shaq.   Embiid is at 24 and 11.5 but that's going to peak and drop off when he's too old to move a lot but is really good in spot minutes.   Howard, both Gasols, Duncan, career averages aren't all that pretty.   Gobert is a threat for 15 and 15 any night though, and his DPOY isn't because he's just a shot blocker. Whiteside is more of a threat to block your shot than Rudy. But Whiteside's defense is very exploitable while Rudy's isn't."
fair enough but prime deandre jordan is not close to current rudy gobert in any regards
It's a sound opinion tho.   I say it all the time bcz people who dont watch Utah and/or know basketball always assume it's Donovan.  Gobert is clearly Utah's most valuable player tho. Everything they do on both sides of the ball is anchored around Rudy &amp; his unique skills @ his position.  That makes him the best player for Utah.
"Yeah tonight was just sad. Like, Rudy Gobert is not a threat to your legacy so lay off. Worst I've seen him since him bullying Javale."
"Rudy on the court would probably clog the paint a bit though. I think someone with more shooting range would be ideal, though Gobert screens and Zion driving sounds like a terrible day at the office for opposing bigs.  Someone like prime KG would've been perfect."
"But yeah, it's dumb, I don't call Rudy Gobert a 2x DPOY, 1x 2nd place DPOY and 1x 3rd place DPOY, and if I ever did, the other kids would laugh at me."
"Why are you being so condescending hahaha  Let’s look at James Hard and Stephen Curry. Both are the system and are superstars. Kawhi Leonard— superstar and trancends a system that revolves around him.   Damian Lillard— superstar? I think so. Plays within a system that allows him to go off. I can see why people would argue against it.   Donovan Mitchell is a star and not a superstar. Rudy Gobert being the focus of their system has produced him individual awards and no real post season success. Good defensive player, not a superstar."
Yeah i’m sure Shaq went after Rudy gobert of all the players for *ratings*
"Rudy had to get all-nba twice, so if you can make the all-nba twice, then yes you can make Rudy Gobert money."
"His harden takes, him getting dunked on by Wood, him trying to “push” these guys, his random ass beef w Rudy Gobert etc.   Dudes trying to force it so much."
bro rudy gobert living in shaq’s head rent free
Rudy Gobert hasn't moved from out the lane since mid 2nd Q my guy. It's really just pathetic to watch. I get your biased but you're a 3 point shooting team playing a paint team and keeping up or beating us in FTs. In a vacuum you know this is just bad officiating. Robbed us of a good game.
I wonder what a team of Rudys would look like.   C - Rudy Gobert  PF - Rudy LaRusso  SF - Rudy Tomjanovich  SG - Rudy Gay  PG - Rudy Fernandez
"&gt;	Rudy gobert won DPOY, he should be guarding LeBron  i wouldn’t be surprised to read this on /r/nba tbh"
"I’m reminded of Game 7 against the nuggets in the bubble and I don’t really remember him doing much. The game came down to Jokic vs Gobert and if Mitchell is supposed to be a number 1 option on a contender, that can’t happen.   The Jazz won’t go anywhere if in the big moments, Rudy Gobert is carrying the offense. That’s why they lost."
"Glad some of us watch the shit and not just comment on highlights. Such a simple take when I see ""DpoY sHouLd GuaRD LeBron, AD AND protect the rim""  It's like ""Rudy gobert won DPOY, he should be guarding LeBron"""
"Zion hates Rudy Gobert, Zion being anti-covid confirmed"
He's worth what teams are willing to throw at him. If guys like Tobias Harris and Rudy Gobert are commanding the max then Lavine is a max guy
So you think he's better than Rudy Gobert?
Offense:  -	Steph Curry -	James Harden -	Kevin Durant -	LeBron James -	Nikola Jokic  Defense:  -	Jrue Holiday -	Kawhi Leonard -	Ben Simmons -	Giannis Antetekounmpo -	Anthony Davis/Rudy Gobert

i'd rather kill myself than think rudy gobert is good at basketball
This episode alone he said rudy gobert is arguable top 3 mvp + having lillard out of the top 10 for mvp for silly reasons that were later contradicted by having luka above him
Rudy gobert is on their team. Biggest pretender of all time tbh
"All-Star is largely just a basic stats game with a dose of reputation.    Team record and defense have never been major factors.  Great players on bad teams make it all the time, and defense simply isn't valued - see Rudy Gobert making the All-Star game once despite being arguably the best defender in the NBA for the last 5 years.  To that end - it's basically gonna come down to Sabonis at 21/11/6 vs Bam at  20/9/5.  Sabonis is clearly ahead, but it's not so different that either guy can't pull ahead in the next couple of weeks.  But nothing is saying either make it.  Or maybe even both.  Like I said, it's such a wild toss up between those 9 names for 2-3 spots and everyone is gonna have their favorites."
"You’re using the worst possible advanced stats to make your case. BPM, win shares and PER are all terrible stats.  John Hollinger, the creator of PER, is a journalist and has no education or background in statistics, he just jumbled a bunch of numbers together and the media treat it like gospel. Hollinger has said PER is a flawed stat and he didn’t use it to evaluate players when he worked for the Grizzlies.  Hollinger  said Rudy Gobert is third in his MVP rankings this morning, he has so many god awful takes, can’t believe people still use a stat this dude created over 20 years ago."
"Curry should be higher, but so should a few other too. The votes are a complete and utter joke, Dame is 13 on the list behind Gobert and Mitchell. How is it Dame and Mitchell are less vauleable than Gobert, and Gobert is a great player. But I would take Lillard and Mitchell everyday of the week over Rudy. Then there is Luka who is ahead them, despite the fact that Portland and Utah are way better, and their star players more deserving this season to be in hunt for the MVP. Lillard has dealt with similar injury problems to Dallas, but Portland is actually competitive. Also I would argue that Tatum, Paul George, Kawhi, and Durant should all be behind Mitchell, Curry, and Dame. Boston is struggling big time, George and Kawhi take days off, because they can. And well Durant is nice, he is playing with two superstar players. The rankings are a farce and don't reflect the true value some of these players bring to their team."
"Team defensive rating is usually the biggest factor, just look at the recent winners of the award.

"Best player on his team?   I mean...... Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Mike Conley...... I get some sensationalism, but this take is... it’s bad.   He’s instant buckets sure, but to say he’s the best player on his team is absurd."
"I mean partially you're right - Mitchell is having a career year from 3p range (in large part due to the fact that he's taking more catch and shoot 3s), but the real standouts for this team are   1. Our guys are more aggressively taking their shots - in the past, Bogey, O'Neale, and *especially* Ingles would inexplicably pass up wide-open 3pt shots to keep the blender running. Now that we're shooting more 3s and the chucking spirit of the Filipino Deity of Love and Vengeance has started to possess our roster, they're really letting them fly from distance.  2. Defense. Royce and Rudy are awesome, but our bench minutes with Bradley on the floor last year were *atrocious* for an NBA team on the defensive end, and now we've upgraded to Derrick Favors, arguably a top-15 center and one of the best rim-protecting bigs in basketball. Niang has also stepped up in a big way, and Conley has really gotten back into form as a premier defensive guard (or as good as you can be while only standing at about 6' tall).  3. Speaking of, Conley has had a wonderful bounceback season so far. Efficiency is way up from last year, his floater is falling, the three ball is dropping, he's running the offense, and he's clicking with Gobert. All that plus Quin's rotations have moved Mitchell to the second unit where Conley was playing a lot of his minutes last year, and now Conley is finally in a great position to succeed.  There are lots of schematic adjustments and improvements in places other than shooting where Utah has improved this year that account for the more aggressive, higher tempo team we're seeing compared to 19-20. It's not just more 3s on a better rate, although that definitely matters."
This was [actually a good quote and I’m surprised he just openly said this about Rudy Gobert](https://twitter.com/tommoorephilly/status/1361543175882571779?s=21). But clearly however it was this case he was pretty motivated tonight
I'm comparing 39 year old Tim Duncan to peak Rudy Gobert.  I'm the biggest Tim Duncan fan and he is obviously a way better player than Gobert.  I'm just just trying to discuss basketball.
You are comparing fucking TIm Duncan to Rudy Gobert and writing paragraphs. Cmon man can’t you see this a troll Jesus
I'm gonna have to say no. That brings to one Rudy Gobert
Yes but it’s not like Simmons is James Harden and operating around the 3 point line getting ready for step backs which are gonna have Gobert lost.   You know he’s gonna try and slash to the rim which Gobert specializes in. Rudy was a good matchup on him. Still funny though.
Rudy Gobert was guarding him lol
"Vs Rudy Gobert too, very impressive for a player who can only score at the rim vs probably the best rim protector in the NBA"
"to be fair, you need to have to have a very high IQ to understand rudy gobert"
You got fuckin Rudy Gobert on your team and your talking about moving screens just stop
well rudy gobert is bad and royce oneal?? and joe ingles moonlights as a history teacher so idk why this is impressive
Simmons has been vocal when asked about how he thinks the DPOY should be a player who can guard all positions and playstyles. I do have to wonder if him attacking Gobert over and over is his way of trying to show that Rudy can't guard him.
"Even if he was just a good free-throw shooter and maybe could pick n pop. He didn't need to be a mainstay in the offense. He would have been so much more valuable, even in this era. Look at the value of players like Draymond Green and Rudy Gobert."
We got Ben Simmons starting at center against Rudy Gobert. God help us
"Nets, Dallas, Atlanta, the Lakers, the Clippers, Portland, Boston, Charlotte, Golden State, Spurs, and Pelicans would all chose Rudy. Probably Denver too as he would compliment Jokic better than Towns.  The teams that have no real stars or are struggling to score probably go with Towns which would be legit. If you have a star or two, and they are guards, Gobert is a no-brainer."
"So excited for this game.     In 5 career games against Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid has averaged just 20.5 PPG on 40% shooting from the field. He's also fouled at an average of 5 times per game with 2.8 of those fouls by Embiid on Gobert.      However Joel is having a career year offensively and Gobert a career year defensively so we could see something different. Either way it should be a red hot contest."
"Except not really.   People can argue over how close they are talent-wise, but in terms of strengths/weaknesses the player he resembles most in the league isn't Rudy Gobert (who is often the comp because of blocks), it's Daniel Theis.   He's an undersized defensive center with some rim running and 3P shooting. He gets abused by bigger frontcourts.  Turner and Theis pretty much succeed and struggle in the same environments. There is really only 1 matchup where they deviate and that's the 4 good games Turner had against Bam. As someone who wanted Turner, my argument was ""he's a younger Theis with a higher ceiling and Theis has been good for us"".    &gt;I meant like they just want to keep this undersized archetype   This is exactly what people would be saying if we did grab Turner."
"Because people don’t realize how crazy good Adams is, his numbers don’t reflect how good he is at all. Pretty sure his team’s offensive rebounding percentage is crazy higher with him on the court than off the court for his career. And people don’t understand how smart he is, Adams makes all the stuff he does look easy but only a couple guys in the league can do what he does.  That’s why he’s still a good player playing his style and got $40/2 year extension last offseason. Him, Deandre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson, Clint Capela, and Rudy Gobert are the only starting centers in the league who still play that way, and Jordan probably shouldn’t even be a starter anymore (maybe Jarrett Allen should take his spot in this list though). It’s REALLY hard to play center in the league without a three point shot now."
They can be 22-5 and that’s cool and all but that doesn’t mean Rudy is better than KAT. In a redraft a GM would always take KAT over Gobert that should be enough to tell you who’s more valued and who’s better
The Denver Nuggets traded Rudy Gobert for a 2nd round pick (Erick Green) and cash considerations.  And then they traded Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.
"Here's a better way to compare it.        Andre Drummond takes 6.6 more FGA per game than Rudy Gobert to score an extra 3.5 PPG. That's extremely inefficient and if he decided to play Gobert's style of rim running, screening and catching lobs he'd be way better.  Instead he insists on getting these garbage post touches, tries to dribble into his drives and attempts 40% of his shots from outside 0-3 feet."
"I was planning on doing an entire player profile because I was thinking about making the video about whether or not the Raptors should trade for him, but I figured it'd take too long and that the trade would be coming sooner rather than later.   I only did a cursory analysis of his defence before dropping the idea, but the one thing that stuck out to me was that he is far too lumbering and slow to be effective on the perimeter. He gets blown by so easily by guards and even some bigger wings. He can't switch, either.   His best defensive asset is his rim protection. He's been terrible this season in that department but I don't think it's fair to focus only on that. Historically, he hasn't been as good as he theoretically should be. Elite rim protectors like Rudy Gobert and Joel Embiid not only force misses when players actually get to the rim, but they also deter players from attacking the rim altogether. Over the last few seasons those guys have cut down opponent shots at the rim bv 5 or 6% and saw a corresponding increase in opponent floaters and mid-range shots. Drummond doesn't seem to have nearly the same deterrent effect."
"He is IMMENSELY talented but seems completely averse to playing to his strengths. He's probably an all-star level player if he locked down and focused on his defense, and approached the offensive end like Rudy Gobert and Clint Capela do. But he doesn't.  Instead he thinks he's a post up big and occasionally a point center, which results in an endless stream of turnovers and a lot of inefficient shooting.  Defensively, he has the tools, but mixes in games with no effort where he's a complete liability. It's just a catastrophe.  He's basically a mirror image of Dwight Howard in Charlotte, if anybody watched that."
"The NBA average for points per possession is 1.11, which means a 56% FT shooter getting two shots is an above-average offensive outcome. A 60% FT shooter is more efficient than the best offense in the NBA.  The worst FT shooter in the league right now, out of 112 qualified players, is Rudy Gobert at 56%. Andre Drummond is the only other guy under 61%. *That's* why hack a Shaq went away, it's bad math unless you're facing an outrageously bad shooter who is also completely unstoppable in the paint. It's not a realistic concern in 2021."
"Honestly most teams centers get played right off the floor. People even say Rudy Gobert does and he's the best regular season defender in the league. Not that I buy that but, I really cant think of ,any teams he would that useless outside of the ones where they need someone to spot them minutes guarding 5s"
"the issue with the demar number there is that he played so much with LaMarcus this year. his on/off without LaMarcus is positive, if that shows you just how bad Aldridge has been. Jakob jumps off the screen to me in the same way Gobert does, you just see the offense getting scared over time. his defense is genuinely unreal.  as for the bench mob, Patty has no exaggeration been a star in his minutes. Rudy has been a monster defensively and as hit or miss as his BBIQ can be, he's still draining ridiculous contested shots when no one else can get anything going to keep us afloat. Vassell is one of the most naturally gifted defenders I've ever seen and he's going to be an absolute fucking menace in the future.  he has awesome defensive stats but the best stuff he does is shutting down off-ball actions constantly like he's clairvoyant.   I'm really enjoying the success for this team even though I wanted to #FADEFORCADE and trade all the old guys."
"The Jazz are another great example of this. They have the best record in the league and currently have 7 players averaging over 20 minutes a game. Of those 7 players, 5 of them are:  - Rudy Gobert - Drafted 27th overall - Bojan Bogdanovic - Drafted 31st overall - Jordan Clarkson - Drafted 46th overall - Joe Ingles - Undrafted - Royce O'Neale - Undrafted  The only players on the roster drafted higher than 27th overall are Conley, Favors, and Mitchell. Granted, some of those players like Bogie and Clarkson were well-established with other teams before joining the Jazz but I think it's cool to see a team doing so well that is mostly comprised of late-round/undrafted guys"
"Most people use the Jazz last few playoff appearances as a reference on why you shouldn't take this team seriously. That is a lazy take for people who don't watch the Jazz, except maybe when they play their team.  2 years ago the Jazz lost to the Rockets, yes, but the Jazz roster was Rubio, Mitchell, Crowder, Favors, Gobert. The team looks completely different now. If you just look at last year, it was pretty similar to this year.   The differences: Conley and Bogdanovic have a year of the system under their belt. They are both playing better this year than last year. Bogdanovic missed the playoffs last year. He was the Jazz 2nd leading scorer with over 20 pts/game. It did take him a bit to get going again this year, but he seems to have hit his stride offensively, but is playing better defense this year and isn't a liability. Even without Bogey last year, if Conley's last shot is 3 inches closer, the Jazz beat the team who went to the WCF finals.  Clarkson was a mid-season trade who fit in decently from the start, and is flourishing in this system. He is playing the best basketball of his career and is front runner 6th Man of the Year. He's another shot creator, which Donovan really needed the last couple years.   Gobert is playing the best he has ever played on both sides of the floor. His defense is quite a bit better than the years he won DPOY, and if he continues is a shoe in. His offense has improved also. If teams really force the Jazz off the 3pt line Gobert gets a lot of open dunks, and if they take away Gobert's touches the Jazz find open 3's.  Mitchell has improved as a facilitator, and is benefiting from having others that can create offense on the floor with him. If teams double team him this year someone is open.  O'Neale has improved his defense and 3pt shooting. He guards the best wing players every game, and is starting to generate noise as a possible defensive team award.   Having a good backup center in Favors is huge. Last year when Rudy left the floor the other teams went on runs almost every game. Tony Bradley just didn't develop as fast as the Jazz needed him to. This year Gobert can get some rest and there isn't a huge drop off.   Finally there were reports that Snyder was bored with being inside from Covid, and revamped both the offense and defense to better fit the players that are on the team. They are getting more open looks at the 3pt line, and when you have four 40% 3pt shooters and Rudy inside, it's just a matter of picking your poison.  The only other argument is that teams don't win without a ""Superstar"". I don't know how a Superstar is defined, but I think they have 2 of the 20 best players in the league. Gobert's impact on the game defensively is equal to the best offensive players in the league's offensive impact. I get that defense isn't sexy, but points saved are equal to points earned. I think Gobert is top ten in the league, and possibly top 3-5. Mitchell is also playing as well as almost anyone in the league. His percentages are up in 3pt% and eFG. His pts, rebounds and assists are all up. He isn't far from averaging 25/5/5 with the best efficiency of his career. Now that teams can't double team and shut the Jazz down, in my eyes, takes this team from good to great.   They are a serious contender this year. Will they win the championship? I don't know. But I think they actually could, and anyone dismissing them isn't watching them. That much I know."
"Imagine a lineup of Lowry, Smart, Beverley, Draymond, and Rudy Gobert. They could win games while scoring under 90 points"
"I can tell you one big difference between the Jazz and those Hawks, Bucks, Raps teams, and its coaching (also notice the common theme of Budd teams overachieving in the regular season and crapping the bed in the playoffs lol). Quin Snyder is a terrific coach and one of the best game planners in the NBA. He's put together terrific gameplans in their recent playoff runs, and the losses have usually been a personnel issue more than anything.   A few other common things I've seen:  &gt; The Jazz don't have a superstar and teams that are legit have at least one superstar.  That could be true, but it might not. We don't really know, but Donovan Mitchell easily could be a top 10 player at some point in his career and it's entirely possible we just don't know it yet. It's true that some teams have won without a current consensus top 10 player, most notably the 2014 Spurs -- incidentally who opposing players and coaches keep comparing this team to, as well as the 2004 pistons -- also comped due to the defensive grit and anchor comparison of Wallace to Gobert. That all said, Mitchell averaged something like 35.5 points (historically one of the best series ever btw) in his last playoff series and lost barely in a 7 game series against a team that went to the WCF.   &gt; This Jazz team has never made it out of the second round, what makes this year different?  Better bench play (Derrick Favors return was an underrated AF move that shored up Utah's biggest weakness -- Utah hemorrhaged points when Rudy sat, and now they don't), Mike Conley playing like his Memphis self, and Healthy Bojan (missed last playoffs against the Nuggets). They were a rimmed three away from going to the second round against the Clippers last year, and that was playing a UDFA rookie as the back up center and no Bojan."
"1-They come at you 48 mins/ night w/5 really good players on the floor at all times who are all fresh &amp; rested. Absolutely relentless pressure.   2- They can beat you with offense, they can beat you with defense.   3- Rudy Gobert is better than you think he is  4- They have the personnel to exploit any weakness you have  5- Quin Snyder might be the best coach in the NBA"
"I think Bill Russell would struggle in the modern NBA relatively to his highs in the 1960s NBA. He'd still be a great player, but his lack of shooting would be much more of a liability now. I think he looks something like Rudy Gobert in the modern game. Rudy Gobert is still a great, All-NBA talent, but he's not in the GOAT discussion like Russell was."
"LOL dude gobert doesn’t even touch steph in terms of impact. Shit I’d take dray over rudy EASY, and Klay. Gobert would be the 4th best player on that team. Gobert is not that good in the playoffs"
"Klay Thompson, Rudy Gobert"
"Maybe not this year. But will Utah compete for titles, I believe so. They play well and it is sustainable. Rudy gobert is underrated imo. Dpoy means you're one of the best players in basketball. And dude isn't a liability on offense either."
"Only Nets can win against Lakers. But i don't think Nets will make it to Finals. People don't know how to rank playoff teams. Utah, Boston, Nets, Clippers, Bucks, Suns, Nuggets are really good teams. But sometimes good isn't enough. They gotta win 4 times against AD and Lebron. And supporting cast looks even stronger than last year. Kawhi is unlucky because he has the weakest duo. I would prefer Jamal Murray or Rudy Gobert over PG.  Edit: or Devin Booker"
The good ol offensive powerhouse Rudy gobert lol
"Funnily enough I think Jazz regular followers have exactly the opposite opinion, Gobert brings the same thing day in day out, like 13/13 and great defensive presence in the paint, and it's the offense who has struggled those recent seasons in the playoffs.  It's precisely this consistency who makes Rudy the best jazz player, his floor is really high and he never has completely awful games. But Jazz ceiling depends more on the ability to still find and make good shots with tighter defenses."
So basically all the stat guys on this subreddit think that Rudy Gobert and Joel Embiid should be the only two guys in the DPOY voting because ORTG overvalues rim-protecting centers. Got it.

Rudy? Does Gobert have an offensive game to worry about?
"I grew up in Utah in the 90s. I used to waive at the Mailman every day because I just associated him with Karl Malone. I met John Stockton once at a golfcourse when I was 10 and I to this day I can still see the texture of his five o’clock shadow in my mind. I worshiped them. I still remember being in our neighbors home theatre and watching John Stockton make the 3 over Barkley to take us to the finals - I still watch that clip sometimes just because of how happy it still makes me. I drive past Karl Malone Drive and John Stockton Drive on my way to work everyday, bought my Honda at the Stockton-to-Malone car dealership, and even though I loved every second of The Last Dance, couldn’t watch the last 2 episodes because the hurt is still too fresh.    Salt Lake City is often described as the hardest city to play in by other teams because our fans are *insane*. We have the passion of a small market that feels like David taking on the Goliath, and we know we can slay Goliath one day. We almost did it. Stockton and Malone almost beat Michael Jordan. We all believed we could, and even though we came up just short, that feeling of reclaiming the glory of the Stockton and Malone days and finishing the job fuels our passion and energy. That emotion lies in almost every Jazz fan; it doesn’t matter if you weren’t even alive in the 90s, your parents were and the love they passed to you for the team was created by the Stockton and Malone days.    If Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert stay in Utah, recapture the passion of the 90s, and finally, *finally* , bring us home the championship we’ve all been waiting our whole lives for, they could very well pass Karl Malone and John Stockton as the greatest Jazz men ever. We turn the Delta Center into a 110 decibel rock show every home game because deep down I think we believe it’s possible."
i hope they despise rudy gobert holding up his fat ass FMVP and Larry O'B baby
"It's not pointless because of that, it's pointless because it is literally impossible for the Nets to get Rudy Gobert. So it's the exact same as replacing Kostas with MJ."
To inquire as to the increase in talent if the Nets were to replace DeAndre Jordan with Rudy Gobert.   Not sure what you're confused about.
The 76ers are the only team I can think off that are worse with Rudy Gobert
Rudy gobert is so good man is dominating on the defensive side like I haven't seen in a long time
I swore that blender pass inside to Rudy teleported right through the outstretched hand of Bam and gobert caught it on the other side
"Completely agree. Like Rudy Gobert is making paint shots tough to score, but heat missing tons of easy shots they usually make."
Rudy Gobert.
Rudy Gobert 3 point attempt bottom text
"&gt;I'm not a guy who just started watching basketball, I've been watching 20+ years.   I appreciate that, and your username was a hint to that effect.  I still maintain that you are wrong.  &gt;There isn't nearly the amount of ""plugs"" in the nba now. You don't see low skilled 7 footers get any meaningful play time when just 10 years ago it wasnt uncommon and even more so 20 years ago.    There are different types of skill.  Playing defense and rebounding are skills, and the necessity of those two skills 20 years ago led to those players getting minutes -- because there were skilled seven footers on many teams that needed to be stopped.  That said, is Rudy Gobert more ""skilled"" than centers of twenty years ago?  What skills does Mitchell Robinson possess that were not commonplace twenty years ago?  What about DeAndre Jordan?  Alex Len?  Steven Adams?  Hassan Whiteside?  Andre Drummond?  Jarret Allen?  Mason Plumlee?  Enes Kanter?  Ivica Zubac?  Jakob Poeltl?  Robin Lopez?  Willie Cauley-Stein?    None of those players would have been at all remarkable for their skills at any point in NBA history.  The difference is that now you have a few teams like Toronto and Boston who don't play any traditional bigs, and who can get away with that because the skill level of bigs in today's game is generally way down from its historical level -- a few players like Embiid, and Jokic, aside."
Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert
"Starters  G: Stephen Curry  G: Damian Lillard  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: Lebron James  F: Nikola Jokic  Reserves  G: Luka Doncic  G: Donovan Mitchell  F: Anthony Davis   F: Paul George  F: Rudy Gobert  WC: Devin Booker  WC: CP3  These are just my predictions, not who I necessarily *think* should make it. For example, De’aaron Fox absolutely deserves a spot imo, but I think he’ll get the Booker treatment from years past where his team just isn’t good enough to get picked over guards on playoff teams."
"**Starters**.      - G: Stephen Curry - G: Damian Lillard - F: Kawhi Leonard - F: Lebron James - F: Nikola Jokic    **Reserves**.     - G: Luka Doncic - G: Donovan Mitchell - F: Anthony Davis.   - F: Paul George.   - F: Rudy Gobert.   - WC: Devin Booker.   - WC: Chris Paul.      ----      SGA, Fox and Zion could all make the team over CP3 and I wouldn't complain but I think the winning record for Phoenix deserves to be recognised and both CP3 and Booker have been playing at an All-Star level."
I want a mask autographed by Rudy Gobert.
"Do you not remember the Lakers and Jazz matchups last year? Have you wiped them from your memory for being too traumatic or something? The Lakers absolutely ran the Jazz off the floor. Surely you must remember [when the Jazz announcers were pissed at LeBron for celebrating while only wearing his socks,](https://youtu.be/ZpgCgGC3ksM) right?   The Lakers came into SLC and blew the Jazz out by so much that early in the 4th quarter LeBron had already taken his shoes off, signed them and given them to a fan, and then later on was celebrating the ongoing blowout with nothing but his socks on and the Jazz announcers thought it was ""disrespectful"" 😂   That was the previous matchup between the Lakers and Jazz. In the one before that the Lakers were winning at halftime, but Vogel started AD at center in the 2nd half and the Lakers embarrassed Gobert, with Rudy having as many fouls and turnovers (2 &amp; 3) in that 2nd half as he had points, rebounds and blocks (2, 3 &amp; 0). So those were all the Lakers-Jazz matchups last year. Not a good sign for the Jazz, IMO.  If you really think AD is not *the* nightmare matchup for Gobert in the playoffs then you clearly haven't been paying attention. If Utah is gonna beat the Lakers, they're gonna have to figure out the Lakers' small ball lineup of AD at center and LeBron at PF. Good luck 😂"
AD does not always roast Gobert. Not even close. Rudy gets him as much as anybody else. Lol at your evidence being one fucking game
We have the perfect defence against Giannis.  Smaller guy/s to hound him on the perimeter and Rudy friccin Gobert to stop him at the rim  👌🏻
Uhh Rudy Gobert?
"&gt;Efg% is not measuring scoring. It is measuring live action shooting.  It's just a combination of 3pt% and 2pt%. Unless you are clarifying layups, dunks, post play as shooting, it just isn't a shooting measurement. e.g. DeAndre Jordan and Rudy Gobert lead the all time NBA career eFG list. I don't think anyone wants to argue they are better shooters than Curry lmao.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/efg_pct_career.html   If you want a stat measuring shooting, you'd be better off just using the part of eFG that best measures shooting, 3PT%, but actual shooting stats also exist. e.g. https://www.nba.com/stats/player/201939/shooting/"
&gt;Lol somehow you made your argument even worse. One video means LeBron doesn’t get unreasonable hate?   That’s one more video than you’ve provided.   &gt;Wtf was Rudy Gobert talking about then?  Who knows? Maybe if Gobert gave an example (like you aren’t) we’d know.
"&gt;	Me linking that video of Broussard was not evidence that the media loves LeBron. It’s simply evidence that they don’t hate lebron like you’re claiming they do.  Lol somehow you made your argument even worse. One video means LeBron *doesn’t* get unreasonable hate? Wtf was Rudy Gobert talking about then?  &gt;	I personally haven’t seen that,   Exactly... because you only see what you want to see."
"What is this, a complimentary post about Rudy Gobert on r/nba? WOW!"
"&gt;Lol love how you ignored the rest of my post because it pointed out how flawed your argument is. So instead you pull up two videos to show they love him and don’t criticize him?  The Chris Broussard video is him saying LeBron has the slightest edge in MVP. You didn’t even bother watching your own videos.  Guy...saying LeBron has the *slightest* edge in the MVP race is not criticism. Not even remotely close. It is quite literally a basketball opinion.  It doesn’t surprise me at all that you see criticism everywhere you look when you’re specifically looking for it. You’re seeing criticism where it isn’t there.  &gt;You’re gonna have to do better than that. I guess Rudy Gobert is seeing what he wants to see also lmao  I guess he is.  &gt;It’s clear you only see what you want to see. Either that, or you didn’t watch basketball back around the “decision” time.  Oh I 100% agree LeBron had received unwarranted criticism in the past. I thought we were talking about recent memory, specifically the last 5 years or so (since we’re talking about Steph I thought we were discussing that time period)"
"Lol love how you ignored the rest of my post because it pointed out how flawed your argument is. So instead you pull up two videos to show they love him and don’t criticize him?

"Definitely a difference in where they were for each, and honestly IDC if Giannis is more athletic haha. The reality is that he got dunked on here, and Gobert wasn't in position to challenge the dunks by Giannis this game. In other games that has been different and Giannis has thrown a couple down on Rudy. It happens."
"&gt;	I’m not sure which media you’re watching, but the media absolutely loves LeBron. Honestly seems like you’re seeing what you want to see.  The irony of this comment is actually pretty hilarious.   Skip, Stephen A, Ric Boucher, Rob Parker, Chris Broussard etc are all super critical of LeBron. That doesn’t even cover all of them. Combine that with all the fans who’s daily goal is to hate on LeBron. He got shitted on for sitting at the end of the bench for a game lmao and then Phil jackson had something to say about him as well. Former players are always unreasonably critical of him as well.   Even [Gobert](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2929639-rudy-gobert-lebron-james-is-the-most-criticized-player-of-our-generation.amp.html) chimed in on it. Do you think he is only seeing what he wants to see as well?"
It's not just Lakers fans. Just before Rudy signed his new contract I saw a Celtics fan say Utah should trade Gobert and Mitchell for Smart and Robert Williams.
"Shaq has been critical of Rudy Gobert all season. Then Rudy puts up a stat line you’d expect from Shaq.   Also, even if lots of other players could do that, Shaq’s averages from 1999-2003 were 28/12 and 2.4 blocks. Those are literally Shaq numbers."
How is embiid a better defender than gobert? Embiid isn't winning dpoy so there's no way he's first tean all defensive team when rudy wins dpoy for the third time in 4 years...
"That’s why Rudy Gobert isn’t the GOAT center right now. It’s Embiid with his abundance of moves and repertoire, just like MJ."
"Tough question honestly, depends on what you value more. Gobert is a monstrous rim protector and his help defense IQ (especially in the post/key) is off the charts. Gasol I would consider a better 1-on-1 defender anywhere on the floor, but still with an edge to Rudy in lateral quickness. So overall, Gobert by a smidgen."

"Definitely on pace.      Rudy Gobert made his 4th All-Defence First Team in his 7th season. The only players with more selections to the All-Defence First team in their first seven seasons are Tim Duncan, Walt Frazier and Kevin Garnett (5)."
Michael Jordan or Rudy Gobert
"That was a weird time.  I think Gobert mentally checked out because it looked like the Jazz were not going to sign him and he was making a statement to how valuable he was.  Conley also had an injury in that time, plus the Jazz had a terrible backup to Rudy.  The Jazz get destroyed when he went to the bench, Favors has solved that."
"Pump the brakes there bud.  I think Royce is an incredible defender but he'll maybe be 3rd team ALL-NBA defensive team.   On the other hand,  Rudy Gobert is a future HOFer defensive specialist, having the best season of his career"

Rudy Gobert had a hell of a game.
"""I dropped the hammer on The Freak. He started lookin' at his feet. Well it's no surprise he got demoralized, he's gonna go back home in defeat. When I jam it home, it rocks you to your bones, and with your messed up joints you realize that two points ain't two points."" -Rudy RapStar Gobert"
Rudy Gobert literally shut down the nba with his stupidity
"I know they're missing Jrue, but the Bucks offense is so ugly when Giannis isn't taking over. They just posted up Brook Lopez against Rudy Gobert with Giannis and Middleton both on the floor. What's the point?"
Rudy Gobert slams it on Rudy Gobert with a spin move
Rudy Gobert was absolutely a project coming into the league and played a good amount of time in the g-league.  Rudy today looks nothing like rookie Rudy.
"Oh do shut up. Who do you think he's being compared to, James Harden and Rudy Gobert?"
"Look, I know you’re a Warriors fan and you all can’t self-regulate since you weren’t loved as toddlers, but calm the fuck down you petulant little bitch. No need to get fucking testy over a critique.   Your hypothetical falsely implies that all-star selections are chosen by stats. They’re chosen based off of popularity. If they were chosen based off of stats, 4/5ths of Atlanta’s starting lineup wouldn’t have made the All-Star game in 2014-15 and DeAndre Jordan/Rudy Gobert/Joakim Noah wouldn’t have been All-Stars.   Also, how the fuck do you define ‘play the right way?’ It’s fucking basketball, not fucking Golf. There’s more than one way to skin a cat in the NBA."
No respect for the Jazz. Mike Conley and Rudy Gobert are well most of those guys.
Flip side tho- defensive stops become exponentially more valuable. A Rudy gobert preventing easy paint looks would be huuuge
I feel like it might also be due to the context of the personnel he's had around him on the court for so much of his career--mostly because Mike Conley now comes to mind so often when thinking about point guards' lob aptitude. Chris Vernon has brought it up a couple times but playing alongside a Marc Gasol rather than a Rudy Gobert dictated a lot of which skills were developed. I can only imagine Dame could be a similar case.    &amp;nbsp;  But also it might just be that three pointers go brrrrrr.
The only way to save the dunk contest is to have Rudy Gobert at the rim and have everyone try to dunk on him.
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"Rudy Gobert's on/off numbers in the last 2 playoffs  2020 - opponent ORTG on court: 120, off court: 107.5  2019 - opponent ORTG on court 114.6, off court: 98.9  That means the opponents offense was abusing the Jazz defense when Gobert was on the court. The more you know!"
"Rudy Gobert's per 100 possession ratings in the playoffs for his career: 125 ORTG, 107 DRTG  That means per 100 possessions the Jazz are +18 when Gobert is on the floor in the playoffs. The more you know!"
And people are allowed to criticize his callouts when they're dumb af. Calling out Rudy Gobert for making money or Donvan Mitchell for potentially never being a superstar are literal shitty takes that people who barely watch the sport would make let alone somebody on a basketball analysis show (comedy or not)
Would be hilarious as Tucker has been pretty vocal on his opinion of Rudy Gobert. Wonder if Tucker would sing a different song if they became teammates.
"True, though we are approaching the anniversary of Tom Hanks-Rudy Gobert Day"
It's hilarious that a fan of a team that saw Rudy Gobert become a star after having to back up Enes Kanter don't understand how important defense is for a big man
This is the NBA bro who cares about defense lol. Unless you have Rudy Gobert type impact it’s not important.
"Rudy Gobert isn't white.   I don't know if you're alluding to his lighter skin color, but I mean, he's still on the court with everybody else, it doesn't stop him from hearing racial slurs even if they aren't directed at him."
"&gt; Rudy Gobert also said he's never heard a racial slur in his time in Utah.  To be fair, one's white and the other is black. Also, Maxwell played in the 80s and 90s when I assume racists were more publicly outspoken."
"I feel like if what Vernon Maxwell was saying is true, that more than zero Jazz players of all generations would have said \*something\* about fans constantly hurling racial slurs towards their opponents.  Rudy Gobert also said he's never heard a racial slur in his time in Utah.  I have an extremely hard time envisioning this being a thing where fans are casually tossing racial slurs at players on a nightly basis as Maxwell is claiming."
"I mean Mike Malone literally said both Murray and MPJ screwed up. I think the NBA coach is the authority here.  It's clear what Murray wants to do, and MPJ should've recognized it too, but there is still no excuse for failing to get a shot in the paint on that play if you're the ballhandler. MPJ's mistake should've taken what would be a 4-on-1 layup and turned it into a 3-on-1 layup. It's Bradley Beal, not Rudy Gobert. Force him to stop a full-speed transition layup by one of the best finishers in the game while backpedaling without fouling or surrendering a putback. The only reason Morris and Campazzo stop is because Murray slows down and looks toward them before he even reaches midcourt."
Has Rudy Gobert been the best center in the league for 5+ years?
do you consider rudy gobert a superstar?
"Yeah, if Rudy Gobert added a good dribble-drive to his game, he'd be unstoppable!"
"He was going against enes kanter and Harrell. But he also dominated Rudy gobert and was good vs poeltl, but he had some good matchups"
this was like the same first sentence as the rudy gobert dpoy last night for the lakers lol
Only thing Rudy can shut down is the league. Corona Gobert
"Yeah but he can’t really guard wings. There’s a huge size difference between him and lot of the SFs in the league. DFS has pretty much been the best at defending any position outside of the 5 for our team. Even if Richardson was doing better on offense, I think he would have been a little bit of a letdown because he really doesn’t move the needle enough defensively  Every Western Conference Playoff Team has 1 truly elite defender besides us pretty much. Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Mikal Bridges, Robert Covington, Draymond Green, Dejounte Murray.  I’m not sure if Gary Harris has been elite, so maybe Denver also, but I know He’s been a lockdown defender in past season."
Still less impactful than Rudy Gobert. At least in the regular season.
Rudy Gobert ain’t clampin up KAT /s
Rudy Gobert ain't clamping up Luka
"To Everyone commenting ""Gobert"". Hes making a meme of the post last night about Rudy winning DPOY. ""I would like to see what I would he like if JJ bares was playing""  Its pasta."
Is it so wild to think there can be guys who are funny and ALSO can give not stupid takes like “if Rudy Gobert can get paid anyone can” and “only 28 and 10” or seemingly weekly just doing the “RINGZ” shit?
He's clearly spoofing that thread about Rudy Gobert being DPOY
Because Rudy Gobert exist. Its not an indictment on Ben; Gobert is THAT fucking good.
Because Rudy Gobert has been better defensively
"He'd be average as hell. Seriously, nothing about his game was special enough to be a weapon in today's league. AD and Giannis would embarrass him both ways and dudes like Rudy Gobert and Jokic would bully him off the court. I think the closest comparison I can come up with is an Injured Bam Adebayo"
"I say this because the current level of the Jazz is simply not sustainable and the Jazz lack true star power, aka a superstar. Donovan Mitchell/Rudy Gobert won’t cut it against the likes of Harden/Kyrie/KD, PG/Kawhi with a better team and playoff LeBron/AD with the best defense.   So to think that It’s dumb to say that the Jazz have the most difficult run out of any contender is just delusion. They are a regular season juggernaut akin to the Bucks the last few years. Could the Jazz win the chip? Sure, but history shows us good regular season teams almost always lose out to the truly elite squads."
Rudy Gobert!
"Favors over Tony Bradley is **monumental**  Last year we'd have similar starts to games that we see this year, only the moment Rudy sat a 12-15 point lead would EVAPORATE because Bradley just isn't a quality NBA defender yet (he's still young and I think he'll turn into a capable rotation piece) and we'd go down.  If we started poorly, when Gobert would sit a close game would become a 12-15 point hole we'd have to dig out of, sometimes we did, sometimes we didn't.  With Favors those leads are maintained, and close games stay close, so when the starters come back in they go up another 12-15 points. And you get a 24 game stretch where Utah wins 20 games by double digit leads."
"No! There are multiple sides to a basketball game. Let's compare Trae Young and Rudy Gobert.   In 35 min, Trae Young is putting up 27 pts, 9.5 ast and 4 reb on 43.8/36.5/87.5 while playing 35 min a game. **Insane offensive numbers but then you look at his defense and he's one of the worst in the league.**   In 30 min, Gobert is putting up 14 pts, 13.3 reb and 2.8 blk on 64/0/59.2. He's a **top 3 rebounder** and is most likely going to win **DPOY**. The difference is that he's **good on offense** too. He puts up 14 points on 8 shots a game.   Sure Trae's numbers are more appealing but there are 2 sides to a basketball game."
"Because players like Kobe made the ASG while missing the entire season due to fan voting. With Fanvoting not being 100% of the starters vote anymore, it got rid of the HOF guys getting one last ASG. If media and players voted for All Star starters when Kobe was playing, I'm sure he's not named a starter as his media vote would've been like 100th to N/A the years he was injured or averaging 14 ppg.   All Star games are for fans, and fan favorite's are going to provide more entertainment value. Seeing 40 year old Dirk drill three deep 3s in the ASG was way funner than seeing 2019 Rudy Gobert have a wide open dunk and a few block shots.  at the end of the day ASGs are for the fans and Dirk and Wade are huge fan favorites. FWIW I don't think ASG should be taken too seriously, especially because conference has a huge impact on All Star selections. Look at Pau Gasol and Bosh. Most would agree Pau was a better player, but Bosh has almost 2x as many All Star Selections as Pau. IMO All NBA should be the ultimate award to look at. Pau has 4 All NBA nods, while Bosh only has 1.  Dirk has 12 all NBA nods and Wade has 8, it's not like they were scrubs."
Gotta be Rudy Gobert
"The NBA on TNT group doesn't think rudy gobert is an impactful player. Also, just because he isn't AS impactful as those guys doesn't mean he isn't important. He's been very good this year."
"EXACTLY. In the playoffs teams scheme around Rudy specifically. Not around anybody else (to the same degree).    They specifically pull him out of the paint or force him to switch so now a big is on a small and they mismatch the entire game.   If the Jazz can switch properly we will win it all. If we can’t figure out the Gobert playoff conundrum, we are done for. Regardless of regular season record."
"Gobert stock, fairly or not, has fallen during/after the playoffs for the last several years. The Jazz facing Houston, the team that was most capable of exploiting Rudy, two years in a row certainly played a role in that"
"Yeah, these people are actually INSANE if they think that LeBron James would be playing the same way if this was a playoff game. It could be Rudy Gobert, Dikembe Mutombo, Hakeem Olajuwon, you name it, LeBron would be driving and getting points if this was a playoff game.  Also Rudy is really good, might win DPOY this year again, but we've seen Anthony Davis absolutely ABUSE him on defense just this past year, so it's kinda weird to talk about how he should be DPOY after last night's game when he didn't even go against the guy that has routinely obliterated him everytime they face off.  The Jazz are cute, their fans will downvote me to oblivion, but we all know that their season ends in the 2nd round the same way it happened to the 2018 Raptors and the 2020 Bucks. The Jazz could win 60 of their 72 games and there are zero people outside of Utah that would pick them to beat the Clippers, Lakers and the Nets/Sixers in consecutive playoff series."
My dream is a Rudy Gobert FMVP and jazz championship if the heat don’t win it. I soooooo want to watch Shaq’s reaction to that
There are so many players that do that and it is *annoying* because there is no foul  Kawhi Leonard and Rudy Gobert come to mind
"Yes but a lot of that was because of what happened when Rudy wasn’t on the floor, which I don’t think is really fair to hurt Rudy’s case. With Gobert on the floor last year we were 7th in defense and with him off we were 25th. Fwiw Mutumbo won multiple DPOYs on average defenses because his own impact was so apparent. I’m more mad that Davis somehow finished above Gobert because the Lakers Drating (106.3) was better than the Jazz’s (109.9), but the Lakers with Davis on vs the Jazz with Gobert on was basically a wash (107.8 to 108.4)."
"I think the lack of javele and Dwight Howard is being understated in your argument. The more that Rudy Gobert gets to guard AD the better for us and Marc gasol is currently averaging just over the same minutes as each of them individually. The lakers backup center presently is Trez who is a total defensive liability and can be matched up with bogey much easier than McGee or Howard would have been. I think losing their size hurts AD against us a lot and they are not similarly constructed to how they were last year so I really don’t think his stats from last year are valuable comparisons. This is a league of matchups and pg and kawhi are without a doubt a worse matchup, we only have one elite perimeter wing defender and them being able to play Morris at the 5 plays Rudy out of the game which harms us a lot more than what the lakers can do."
"&gt; Tell me why Rudy Gobert is not the DPOY again this year, please.  Voter fatigue and a great defensive season from Myles Turner.  Rudy deserves it, though."
That is 100% not what I'm saying haha.  My only point was Rudy Gobert has improved on perimeter defense since 2019.   Which is a pretty tame claim compared to saying he can single handedly stop 3 of the best offensive weapons in the nba.
Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert are not top 10 players in the league though. Most of the time a #1 seed destroying teams on a nightly basis like this will have at least one top 10 player on that team. They seem to be a team with just insane depth.
Doesn't Embiid shoot a career 40% against Gobert?   Rudy can claim to be the DPOY because he obviously IS.

"Rudy ""Aaron Donald"" Gobert"
"tbh I think that the contenders who can really build a gameplan around Rudy consist of   - Lakers (but only in their minutes with AD at the five, and in those minutes the rest of their supporting cast is pretty soft)  - Clippers (when their five-wing lineup gets rolled out, but I'm sure Quin will have his own set of adjustments to make after seeing that)  Either way, they can always just adjust who Rudy matches up against / what minutes he plays so that we have a more switchable lineup on the floor (Oni, Morgan are both guys who I think could see real playoff minutes depending on the matchup / use case, plus any buyout guys). Rudy has played a *lot* more minutes against the opposing team's second unit this year in tandem with Mike as opposed to last season, so the unicorn-style players like AD or Jokic who really present matchup problems are just not going to spend as much being guarded by Rudy if regular season is anything to go by. That means more time where Rudy's all-time level defensive impact is at its most impactful. Clippers could bust out the five-wing lineup and Gobert will definitely play for some of those minutes, but he'll also be playing in the minutes where Zu is the 5 and the Jazz will really be able to exploit those minutes. Same with the minutes where Trez or Gasol play the five in any LA series."
"&gt; bro if the jazz can mirror the air bud timeline, and the air bud multiple sequels  Didn't the sequels involve Air Bud playing other sports like hockey and baseball?    Because watching Rudy Gobert trying to throw a fastball would be entertaining AF, not gonna lie."
"Lol I think the real answer to that is Gobert came into the league as an amazing rim protector his first couple years but was not asked to do a ton of perimeter defending. Jazz would force 3 point shooters into the paint where Rudy would eat them up. His perimeter D tho has really stepped up since around last season, so people still have a view of him as a stiff rim protector even tho his game is more dynamic these days."
"When the Warriors last played the Jazz people were asking why Wiseman was shooting from midrange and deep instead of going to the paint.  And, like... Rudy Gobert? Is right there?"
There's one in every Rudy Gobert thread
"Donovan Mitchell, or Rudy Gobert"
Just cause he had a good game that does not mean that he was not best player on the floor. It’s clearly Joel Embiid and Rudy Gobert.
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
"I'd give Rudy Gobert a phone call, but he blocked me."
"I would have no doubts about either, great basketball instincts, freak athletes, pure bred winners, they'd translate no problem, worst case scenario for Bill Russell would be a super juiced Rudy Gobert and worst case scenario for Wilt would be a bigger, stronger, faster, really he has no comparison."
The jazz have rudy fkin gobert
"If you take out the first year when Gobert was a rookie AD is below his season average. Like the first game they played in 2014 AD put up 43 and Gobert only played 14 min coming off the bench, so they probably didn't even match up much.   He obviously still scores well against Rudy but cook probably isn't the right word."
"- Embiid averages 20.5 PPG on 40% shooting in his 5 game career against Gobert.      - Towns scored just 16 points on 6/19 shooting in his last game against Rudy.   - Sabonis scored just 20 points on 7/20 shooting in his last game against Rudy.     - Porzingis scored just 29 points on 12/32 shooting in his two games against Rudy this season and even got played off the court because he couldn't handle Gobert in the paint and got in foul trouble.        Top 10 offensive powerhouses like AD and Jokic have done really well against him but Gobert has historically and this season locked up the other bigs that you claimed ""could get their own on him"""
Rudy is great. But I remember in the bubble when they had to pull Gobert out the game because of how AD was just cooking him. Anyways Rudy go earn your DPOY.
How many easy ass baskets is Rudy Gobert gonna get out of pick-and-rolls right now?
"We do, we get so many threes because teams take away Gobert at the rim, he's part of the reason we get so many.  The Mavericks made the mistake of not taking away the interior from Rudy earlier in the season and Rudy dropped a 20-20.  We can absolutely switch it up when we need to, you'll see it if you take the time to watch Jazz games."
"We do, we feed Gobert on PnR. Then when guys start collapsing on Rudy too much, we go back to passing for open threes."

UTAH JAZZ KINGDOM OF BIG MEN:   3. Rudy Gobert   2. Mark Eaton   3. Greg Ostertag
More like Rudy Gobert lite
Gobert. The entire offensive and defensive scheme relies on him. Cant have that spacing without Rudy
"Ya he is pretty damn good. Of course not at Rudy Gobert level, but the best part of Ayton's game now is his defense and rebounding. He is especially good at perimeter defense for a big and I actually look forward to see what happens when a guard is switched onto him."
"This stat exists and is called ""Screen assists""  Take a look at:  * [Hustle stats at nba.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/hustle/?sort=SCREEN_ASSISTS&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) (sort by screen assists) * this article: [Why the NBA Internet is fighting about ‘screen assists’ - SBNation.com](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/16/21068898/nba-internet-fight-screen-assists-uah-jazz-rudy-gobert-basketball-stats)"
"He's ridiculously big I saw him and Rudy Gobert up close standing next to each other during a game, and he dwarfed Gobert, not in height but in sheer girth. He's probably the largest human being I've seen in person."
"True that, but calling him a defensive specialist really minimizes his achievements.  When i think of defensive specialist I think of Ben Wallace, Dikembe Mutombo, and Rudy Gobert"
Do you know who leads the NBA in all time offensive rating? None other than RUDY GOBERT  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/off\_rtg\_career.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/off_rtg_career.html)
"He plays Embiid extremely well. Well enough that Embiid noped out of facing him a week or two ago. A business decision on that MVP bid (I kid, kinda.)  For most of his career, Gobert actually had the upper hand on AD as far as keeping him in check, as much as anyone can. The last year non-Lebron AD played Gobert, Gobert dominated AD in both matchups they both played in. AD got him last year, but LA was head and shoulders above the Jazz as a team last year.  Jokic is a problem, but Jokic's career average against Gobert is 21-10-6 with Gobert winning more games 9-8. Jokic didn't dominate Gobert in the playoffs last year, they played pretty even. You are just going off of the last game against Denver where Denver his something like 16 out of 18 of their first three pointers. That game is an extreme outlier and not really representative of the matchup as a whole.  I mean if your whole premise is that Rudy is mediocre at matchup defense because he doesn't dominate Embiid, AD, and Jokic defensively every single time they play, that's just silly. NOBODY can do that, not every time. Gobert doesn't match up like that anyway.  If you want to see this on th ecourt, here is a video. It's older, and I think Rudy has improved since last year, but it gives you an idea:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y93fx0ZDLAQ"
"When you're talking about actual basketball, sure  but you have to understand how much more the All-star game is weighted for offense. It's a glorified WWE match, all they care about are flashy numbers.   Rudy Gobert wasn't even an all-star reserve either year he won defensive player of the year."
"Yeah, maybe he should drop 40 on Rudy Gobert or something"
"&gt;	You can’t say your opinion matters more than the actual players who voted.  Not even making a judgment call on Booker here, but this is bad logic. The player vote is crap every single year.   A large amount of players don’t take it seriously. Even if they do, then just because a guy plays in the NBA doesn’t mean he’s good at analyzing it (look at how many former NBA players make terrible analysts).   Carmelo Anthony was 9th in player voting for the West frontcourt, with only 4 less votes than Rudy Gobert. Kostas Antetokounmpo got 10 player votes."
"Missing a Rudy Gobert type defender makes a huge difference in the ability to win regular season games and be a top 2 seed IMO, but I think they'd be a top 6 seed personally"
"'And while we're at it, don't even get me started on Rudy Gobert...'"
"I wonder why you might have left out the massive gap in fg% yet noted Mitchell's shooting the 3 better?  ""Every other aspect"" yall always point to ""Mitchell can play D"" yet he's been abysmal this year. Mitchell's on/off stats with Rudy Gobert do not favor him either. Also, Booker's team is at 20-10, he's not on some poverty fringe playoff team anymore."
"That makes no sense since back issues doesn't mean you can't learn footwork. Dwight lacked the skill to be more dominant offensively, your comparison makes little sense. Gobert will never be an MVP, he's even remotely in this conversation. Dwight was a significantly better offensive player than Rudy has ever been. Even declining Dwight on the Rockets is something Rudy has never had a whiff of. Your attempt at analysis screams you never watched Dwight play and you just read stats."
Probably would like to see less Rudy Gobert and more Booker though... and less Vucevic/Simmons and More Sabonis/Trae/Bam....
"[Same.](https://twitter.com/RunTheJules/status/1343819305327099904)  ""Gobert's not a creator of offense, I don't care, stop with the screen assists.

Stop saying it!"""
Why the hell is Rudy Gobert on this list. NBA is a joke lmao. Simmons? Westbrook is averaging more than him in almost every stat category.
Rudy Gobert is a 2x All Star so that contradicts your point
"If Rudy Gobert can make it, then anything is possible"
"Wrong. Per Yahoo,   Western Conference G: Damian Lillard  G: Chris Paul  FC: Anthony Davis  FC: Rudy Gobert  FC: Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: Paul George"
I'm pretty sure he's not saying that Rudy fucking Gobert is Shaq-like on offence lmao. Just that he plays more like Shaq style wise than someone like an Embiid or a Giannis.
"I think they have similar impacts in different ways if that makes sense. Rudy is a defensive anchor and DeMar is the best playmaker on offense, both teams would suffer a lot of any of them goes down but again in my biased opinion DeRozan should be here in his place given he's putting better numbers across the board (yes I totally understand different positions, but my point is DeRozan is putting numbers that should put him in the ASG ahead of others like Gobert)"
Yeah I understand the bias lol. Gobert not being the first option on offense doesn’t matter. He is a defensive monster and is helping lead his team to the 1 seed. You take Rudy off that team and it has a bigger impact than Demar being off the spurs does imo
It's an All-Star game. Fans want to see Book not Rudy. And I think Gobert is a more impactful player than Booker too.
"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"
"West: Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis   East: James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic  Just a feeling I have"
"Seriously.   No disrespect to Horford, he was a great player there in his prime, &amp; OP is right about him being their best player.   But he 100% wasn't doing what Rudy does. Utah's entire system &amp; roster is built around Gobert."

"My guy. Myles Turner is 1st in blocks. You know what else he is? 1st in fouls committed. Rudy Gobert is (I think) 3rd in blocks, and 99th in fouls committed. Myles Turner is a whirling dervish at the rim, Gobert is a disciplined expert."
"Yeah that’s true. I’m not trying to discredit Gobert or say he’s undeserving of DPOY, so Jazz fans please stop downvoting me lol. Just that I like watching Simmons because he’s a guy you can switch onto someone like Harden or KD to try to slow them down.   Rudy slows them down indirectly, his presence in the paint takes away a scoring option for the offense without even needing to guard them 1 on 1. Just by virtue of him being the rim protector, guys will be less likely to attack the paint.   Really hard to compare each type of defender. Ideally you need both lol, someone who can step out and switch onto different types of scorers, and someone to anchor you in the paint."
"Sure it would.   Last year the Raptors had a 105.0 defensive rating, better than the Lakers do now, and second only to a really dominant Bucks defense. They had no players appear on any DPOY ballots, and didn't have any players make All-Defense. And that was reasonable - they didn't have any individual super dominant defensive players.   In general, unless you have an overpowering rim protector like Rudy Gobert, one player doesn't tip the scales much for a team's defense. It's much more of a product of collective effort and coaching."
"On-Off defensive rating differential.      A stat the effectively looks at how many points fewer per 100 possessions teams score when a player is on the court compared to on the bench. [Here are the league leaders this season](https://twitter.com/statmuse/status/1371927990611836929?s=20).      - 7.3 — Rudy Gobert,    - 5.8 — LeBron James,    - 4.2 — Giannis Antetokounmpo,    - 4.2 — Robert Covington,    - 4.0 — Myles Turner"
"Embiid didn't ""son"" him. Didnt he go something like 6/17 with Rudy as his primary defender? Embiid had a great game either way, but this is just a false narrative.  Jazz are the best defensive team in the league because of Gobert. There's a reason the man has 2 DPOY already. Easily the best rim protector in the league and averaging a steal and 3(!!!!) blocks per game"
???   &gt;So currently Rudy Gobert is by far the most impactful defender in the league
yeah hes a good defender but hes not rudy gobert and some people have been getting a little ahead of themselves

"no one gets rudy gobert as a rookie, except donovan mitchell"
"i dont have to play this theoretical because the jazz already built a team around rudy and we're better than the mavericks?  gobert is a 3x All NBA, 2x DPOY i dont really understand why people still think hes trash....hes actually one of the best players in the league and the jazz have built the best team in the league around him"
"No, not really. Gobert has pretty much always obliterated Porzingis whenever they’ve matched up (pretty sure he averages 25+) and it’s a bad matchup for Luka as well. We don’t help off the pick and roll so his drive and kick game isn’t as good and he’s never done well against Rudy. He always tries to iso Gobert and it’s never ended well for Luka. Doncic’s career numbers against the jazz have been worse than any other west team."
"We aren't but a big reason why we'd win the series is that KP is so incredibly soft. In 7 career games against Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert has recorded averages 21.4ppg on 55/73 shooting (75%) from the field, 13.6 rebounds and 2.9 blocks.       In their recent head to head this season Gobert dropped 29/20 on the lanky pillow pet.      If the Jazz matched up with the Mavs in round 1 we'd be winning in three games due to our pick and rolling prowess that Zingis has no way of containing."
KP has absolutely never been a problem for us lol. There's the idea that he'd pull Gobert out of the paint but the dudes fouls out on the other end when he can't stay with Rudy.
"rudy gobert is a lot better than you think, there is a reason why we have the top seed and you dont"
Rudy Gobert is not a better player than Luka... idc what a two game sample size says
"We aren't but a big reason why we'd win the series is that KP is so incredibly soft. In 7 career games against Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert has recorded averages 21.4ppg on 55/73 shooting (75%) from the field."
"Even if you wanted to make the argument that Mitchell is a better player than Gobert, I think Rudy would still be more valuable for us just because the role he plays is so unique. If we don't have Donovan it can be rough but we have other scorers and ball handlers. If we don't have Rudy our entire defensive scheme falls apart and we lose a lot on offense too from his screens to the gravity on the pnr. Rudy doesn't do everything, but the things he can do he does so damn well."
"id say best but people would have me for a nutter, impactful is more palatable for you all  also, i know youre a gobert hater, so im not really interested in arguing with you about rudy"
"I have yet to hear some one bring up advanced stats in a real life basketball debate, I also have yet to hear someone ever defend Rudy Gobert in real life."
"I wish you were right about this but way too many jazz fans have such a tenuous grasp of the game that I’ve heard that Gobert is our “4th best” by someone “being generous” and enough people agreed to make me lose hope.   Gobert isn’t just our most important player, he’s our best by a lot. Also - this season I’d argue the difference between Mike and Don is negligible, and the difference even between JC and Don is far closer than between Rudy and Don"
"Are we forgetting that Dwight Howard was a 3 time defensive player of the year and the best player on a finals team??? I know he’s fallen very far, but the disrespect of asking why Dwight is not Rudy. Lol Dwight I’m his prime was waaay better than Rudy gobert."
"Brick wall factor, Rudy Gobert is a brick wall on defense, other guys are not"
"Short answer: Rudy Gobert is extremely good.  Long answer: There has definitely been a movement towards small ball and or stretch 5’s in general that has made the “traditional” center generally harder to give big minutes to.  Not because the skills of a traditional center (rim defense, rebounding, post play/rolling to the hoop) are no longer valuable, but that generally the player that does all those things well is too slow to adequately defend the perimeter, and can be exploited out there. Rudy is just so smart, skilled and mobile enough that he’s very capable getting pulled out of the paint, and is still able to perform the traditional big man roles extremely well. He’s hard to exploit, and consequently, hard to deal with in general."
"You can beat Rudy Gobert but not by pump faking into a layup. First of all he doesn't need to jump, what are you faking for? Lmao"
"Play like rudy Gobert and you’re gonna have 2 fouls in the first 2 minutes, 3 fouls a minute in the 2nd, and 6 fouls playing only 15 minutes all game."
"What was embiid’s shooting stat while Gobert was guarding him? Something like 6/18 shooting? Honestly, someone tell me, I forgot the number. But my point is that Rudy did just fine guarding a potential mvp."
Rudy gobert
It's Rudy Gobert' to lose imo
Embiid scored 16 of those points while Gobert was on the bench but to drop 24 with Rudy on the court is still incredibly impressive. He'd be my MVP if he wasn't set to miss a bunch of games.
The Rudy Gobert special
Rudy gobert is the best center in the league
&gt;Rudy Gobert over his last 2 games   Next level nit-picking.. NBA Twitter material
Simmons is the best defender in the league..... after Rudy gobert
Rudy Gobert is a fucking legend
I mean you’re not wrong but we’re going against Rudy gobert so we don’t have a ton of choice
Of course people only want to post his stats when he plays bad. It’s not like he played great literally the game before against Rudy Gobert
"If you're gonna iso against Gobert, your chances are much better taking the 3 than driving. He's good at staying with guys or making up ground and plays expecting the drive, so he's less good at contesting a jumpshot. Driving against Rudy is almost never an advantage situation."
Rudy Gobert is an MVP candidate
Y’all call Rudy Gobert the defensive player of the year &amp; every year his defense gets made irrelevant in the playoffs where as LeBron’s defense becomes even better in the playoffs. NBA fans are brainwashed man.
Not anymore. Au revoir Rudy Gobert and hello Rudy Gilbert
Think of the volleyball team that USA could roster if players played that instead of basketball. Rudy gobert not even jumping to spike
Rudy Gobert is the best player by far
Dude said Jrue holiday was better than Rudy Gobert lol
Someone tell Rudy Gobert that he has a massive physical advantage and should not be allowed to play in the NBA.   You TERFs disgust me
"I don't know why, but the NBA Second Spectrum has a different defensive rating formula/ranking. Among players with 25+ mpg, this is how the ranking looks like:  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=MIN*GE*25&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Season=2020-21  1. Patty Mills 2. Mike Conley 3. LeBron James 4. Kyle Kuzma 5. Rudy Gobert"
"The problem is he hasn't under-performed in the playoffs at some grand level.  The last four years he's averaged 26/12/5/1.5/1 on 53/33/62 shooting splits with just over 3 turnovers per game. That's a typical from regular season to playoff numbers. He lost to better teams in 2017 and 2018 and made it to the conference finals in 2019. 2020 was rough and had some non impactful games, but he had some huge games, including his final one when he went down with the injury.    Giannis being a bad playoff performer is up there with Rudy Gobert gets played off the floor in the playoffs. Giannis needs to get better, but he's doing pretty damn good so far."
"Whilst I’m glad we’re not shitting on Rudy as much anymore, I’m not a huge fan of Gobert hate being replaced with Mitchell hate lol"
"Against Rudy Gobert, none the less. Kid is just super inexperienced and inconsistent as a result. The only way to fix inexperience is to play the game. He’s definitely going to have more nights like this."
I’m so fucking happy that this man can play like Rudy Gobert and LeBron as he wishes
"On a similar note, Nerlens Noel is fourth in the league in blocks per game, averaging 2.0 a game despite only playing 22.2 MPG, which puts him at 157th in minutes per game. He is second in the league in block percentage with 8.9% (behind Myles Turner) and third in the league in defensive rating with 102.4 (behind Rudy Gobert and Anthony Davis)."
"Is it more impressive to score in the playoffs or against a team like the current Cavaliers? That is what you are asking here  The rate is very similar, with the difference being the number of playoff games (28 maximum and likely less) vs the number of regular season games (82 unless Rudy Gobert tries to kill the whole league again) with 21 (two 6 game series, a 4, and a 5) being a perfect 4:1 ratio matching that of the score"
"Wait what? Embiid is playing in the space and pace era and smaller centers lmfao. Embiid never played against Robinson, Rodman, Shaq, Ewing, Eaton lol. Embiid gets stuffed by Gasol and Horford and you have the audacity to say this dkm man. Embiid will dominate Daniel Theis, Rudy Gobert, and Kanter, he's just worse at everything than Hakeem except for 3 shooting and foul drawing."
"&gt; Don't forget Butler has been rising steadily in terms of stats and doesn't look likely to slow down anytime soon.  Out of his last ten games *two* were against teams with a win% higher than .500. This season he has played seven games against teams that are currently .500 or higher, and against those teams he has an average BPM of... 3.2. So no, I disagree that the numbers of his recent games (which still fall short of the basic averages of other MVP candidates) are bound to continue.  &gt; Nobody is saying they'd vote Butler if the season ended today.  I responded to someone saying he should be a candidate. Someone else has said he is a top 8 candidate.  Once again:  * He has missed 14 games so far * He falls significantly short of other candidates on basic metrics that yes, are *not* advanced, and are *not* the full picture, but nontheless MVP voting has generally followed in the last five years.  It would be unprecedented on *multiple* levels if he were to receive significant votes. It would be so unprecedented basketball-reference doesn't even list him in their tracker, which goes down to Rudy Gobert at 1.6%. Here are some players that an unnamed betting exchange valued at over $2 billion has listed as *more likely* to win MVP this season:  * Jaylen Brown * Domantas Sabonis * Kyrie Irving * Bradley Beal * Jayson Tatum * Anthony Davis * Devin Booker  If your argument for 'serious consideration' is 'But what if?' then I can throw up hypotheticals for, say, Julius Randle (he has a higher VORP! They have an easier schedule ahead! Not missed a game yet!) and the whole thing can be meaningless."
"Yes, easily. The adjustments do sound excessive until you look at the data without it. LEBRON is fairly similar to PIPM(even if they didnt explicitly say so on the podcast) with one of the relatively few significant differences being the role adjustment. That was one of the issues with PIPM you had guys like Duncan Robinson still being way too high. You can order with the specific order of the top 25 or whatever in O-LEBRON that's all fair game but the actual players that consist of the top 25 are in line with what they should be in reality in no small part because of role adjustments.   EPM is also better it's pretty similar to what the old RPM model was back when it was good. RAPTOR is just trying to do too much, stuff like incorporating tracking data which it's very much TBD if it actually helps improve your model and its validity or if its just noise. Trying to do all that stuff is part of what screwed up RPM. It also just fails a bunch of super basic face validity type tests like having Mike Conley way too high defensively because he shares 90+% of his minutes with Rudy Gobert."

"Rather than reply to this with some type of argument, I would encourage you to read the recent article from the [Ringer](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2021/3/11/22324651/utah-jazz-beat-writers-covid-19-positive-rudy-gobert) that provides additional context about the mic touching scene."
"Well that’s kind of what their point is... the idea being that anyone could get triple doubles playing with Steph because a pass to him is more likely to become an assist than a pass to literally anyone else at any time in the history of basketball.  Which is dumb, but the logic at least makes sense to a certain degree in theory.  It would be like if Rudy Gobert played on a team with a bunch of 5’10” dudes and averaged 20 rebounds a game, people would say he only leads the league in rebounds because of who his teammates are, when in reality he could probably do it anyway with normal teammates"
"Nine have a weakness that glaring and that odd. Dame could be all time if he were a better defender but it's not like he freezes in place every possession and refuses to try. He tries and just isn't that great.  Gobert could be all time if he added more of an offensive game, but there's no one specific thing that would catapult him. What's odd about Ben is not that he is falling short on one aspect of his game, it's that that aspect does not exist. He literally does not shoot the ball. Simmons takes a similar percentage of his shots from past 10ft as Rudy Gobert, who is not famed for his versitile scoring abilities.  Simmons might be the only elite player ever who becomes all time great if they become below average at something. Not even good, just making a half hearted attempt twice a game."

Well Rudy Gobert is the all-time leader in screen assists since the NBA began in 1949-50...just don't ask me when that stat was originally tracked.
"Screen assists are a real stat though, just maybe not as black/white as stat-heads would prefer: [https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/16/21068898/nba-internet-fight-screen-assists-uah-jazz-rudy-gobert-basketball-stats](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/1/16/21068898/nba-internet-fight-screen-assists-uah-jazz-rudy-gobert-basketball-stats)"
Rudy Gobert is not better than Karl Anthony Towns lmao. I refuse to accept that people actually believe that 😭
"Their stats are nearly identical. Rudy Gobert has no post game/moves ,he can't shoot free throws, he can't defend the perimeter. Comparing him to other DPOY winners he has to be one of the worst to win it."
Would you call someone like Rudy Gobert a role player? Coz that's basically what you're saying.
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.

there's a guy named Rudy Gobert... incase he didnt know
"&gt; *it’s a good matchup for Rudy*  If they got to play GSW every game, Gobert would be teabagging Shaq."
Everyone gives their pitch on how they are the best defender in the league after they beat Rudy gobert lol
"Rudy Gobert dominated this game, but Derrick Favors spent every minute he was on the floor committing treason."
That Steph Curry screen was so good.    Rudy Gobert didn't see it coming.
"""If Rudy gobert can't match up against Steph Curry he's not the DPOY."""
"It’s not Gobert’s fault that he has a great supporting cast but it puts a dent in the idea that he’s “carried” the team. Kobe carried the mid-2000s Lakers. Lebron carried the mid-2000s Cavs. Gobert has never carried anything.  &gt; KAT has never accomplished anything  You realize he plays for the TWolves, right? And what has Rudy “James Harden” Gobert done in the playoffs besides get exposed on switches? You act like the Jazz have done shit in the playoffs lmao"
"Hey, he's almost up there with the 6'5 Rudy gobert"
"Nice selections. This is what I've come up with while trying to take into consideration individual stats, team success and games played/minutes.      |Team|Player|Position| :-:|:--|:--|.    |1st|Damian Lillard|G| |1st|Stephen Curry|G| |1st|Giannis Antetokounmpo|F| |1st|LeBron James|F|.   |1st|Nikola Jokić|C|.   |||.   |2nd|James Harden|G| |2nd|Luka Dončić|G|.  |2nd|Kevin Durant|F| |2nd|Kawhi Leonard|F|.   |2nd|Joel Embiid|C|.   |||.  |3rd|Chris Paul|G| |3rd|Kyrie Irving|G|.  |3rd|Jimmy Butler|F| |3rd|Paul George|F| |3rd|Rudy Gobert|C|"
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
"&gt; To be clear, my point isn't that Jokic is terrible defensively in the playoffs. It's that he has a clear weakness which can be exploited by a team with the right personnel  i think this is a totally valid criticism, i just also think that Mitchell shooting like Steph Curry and Rudy Gobert rolling is going to be really hard for anyone to stop  That series was a fluke, with Murray and Mitchell both playing at a level we've never seen from them before or since. Plenty of teams play drop coverage and Mitchell doesnt transform into 2016 Steph  On top of this, Denver still won the series. Jokic dominated game 7.   Sure Jokic has weaknesses in his game and likely needs defensive teammates to help bail him out. Few players are perfect.   AD can't carry an offense without an elite PG to create most of the shots for him.  But now he has LeBron, so he can just focus on finishing and defense. Doesnt mean he's not great"
"sixers fans trying to downplay embiid so simmons can win DMVP, lol  Simmons might be the best perimeter defender in the league, but unless you're peak Kawhi, you aren't as valuable as an elite interior big.

Nikola Jokic allows 68.5 and 12.4 FGM a game at 35.9 mins per game.   Rudy Gobert allows 60.8 and and 10.2 FGM at 30.7 mins per game.   So essentially Jokic allows 2 more made FGs at the rim per game in 5 mins more of game time against what is generally considered the best rim protector in the NBA not insignificant but the reason why advanced stats love jokic it so much is the things he does do on defense including the most important part to actually winning the game rebounding. People overrate rim protection.

Gobert are you serious? I can name a 100 players that are worse at the pick and roll than Rudy.
Do you think Simmons is closer offensively to tony Allen or Rudy gobert then?  You think tony Allen and Ben Simmons are comparable offensively?
Lol how many players would you take on your team before Rudy Gobert?   Offense is so much more important than defense
"Easily Rudy Gobert bro is looked at as a top three center strictly because of help defense and setting screens ( and frankly a lot of those screens are illegal). Really don’t think I’ve seen a player get away with more contact either. Bro has his own compilation of him getting away with fouls on late game layups.   No way in hell should he be looked at as better than bam, Kat, ayton, or vucevic"
Rudy Gobert
"Typical haters cherry picking random betting sites, and not using the official NBA ladder lol.  LeBron was literally #4 in DPOY in late February here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/news/defensive-player-ladder-rudy-gobert-ben-simmons-maintain-leads%3famp=1  And now he's still top 5 in the race here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/news/defensive-player-ladder-importance-team-defense-utah-jazz%3famp=1  Can't misrepresent the facts lol, nice try tho"
Rudy Gobert. Always looks good against small lineups but consistently gets dirtied by capable bigs.
"Jazz starters don't get outscored, Rudy Gobert has the highest +/- in the whole fucking league. Their entire starting lineup is near the top.   Team plays a 9 deep roster, with a really strong top 8. That is a typical playoff depth chart.  Teams that suffer come playoff time are the ones that go 10+ deep."
"It’s a dumb tweet but there’s at least a bit of true things. He’s not as much overrated as he is incorrectly categorized. He’s not a superstar, he’s basically the wing/guard version of Rudy Gobert"
"Not enough top end talent for the Jazz to beat the Suns? May wanna back off that overconfidence a bit there. Jazz top 2 match's the Suns, and i would argue the top 6 for Utah is significantly better than Phoenix. The Suns advantage is in the deeper bench, which will be mitigated a bit come playoff time.  Rudy is on pace for the hall for sure. Ben Wallace is very likely to get in eventually. Gobert could certainly match Wallace's defensive accolades by the time be retires, but he is MUCH better offensively (Wallace is a career 5.6 ppg scorer). Calling Rudy an all star roll player is insulting, his overall impact metrics place him as a top 10 player this season overall. In a hypothetical Jazz Suns playoff matchup I think Gobert has a strong argument for being the best player in that series.  Additonally, it's not like the Suns are stacked with sure fire hall of famers. Bookers chances are comparable to Mitchell's. Paul is a first ballot lock, but that's it. Paul has not demonstrated he can lead a team to a deep playoff run consistently. He has played well in the playoffs, but one conference finals in a 15 year career makes it hard to expect them to make a deep run.  Utah actually has a very at strong record when they shoot poorly from 3. They are a great 3 point shooting team but have shown they can win without it.   Utah is a woeful matchup for Dallas. Portland would need a superhuman performance from Lillard to keep it close, and even then it would likely not be enough. Denver beat Utah on a missed buzzer beater in 7 last year, and this year's Utah team is much much better while you could argue Denver has regressed. I'd be surprised if any of those three teams took a healthy Utah team past 5 games.  Gobert only really struggled in the playoffs against Houston, who were a terrible matchup for past Utah teams. This Utah team plays a different style than those teams did, and no team that Utah could play quite fits the stylistic mold of that Houston team.   Utah could surely lose to one of several teams in the playoffs, but I see no team that Utah cannot potentially take down. And with a fair chance of home court advantage throughout, and the expectation of a full crowd come playoff time, Utah will not be easy for anyone to take down."

"lmaoo! 13 people still trolling rudy gobert in some random ass r/nba thread = ""people forgive a domestic abuser but hold a grudge on Rudy!!!"" fuck outta here with that jump to conclusion, look at me im the real victim BS. Both can be true ya know, KPJ can be a dirtbag while Rudy is *still* a clown for those antics."
If somebody called Rudy Gobert  “bubonic plague” would that also be unacceptable? Its just dumb trash talk
"Honestly, Zion needs to shed some weight but he's also a very unique player that can justify his bulk. Embiid is strong, but Zion is STRONG. Watching the Pels games against the Jazz is ridiculous, Gobert is one of the strongest guys in the NBA but Zion just breezes through him like he's not even there. I've never seen any other player consistently bulldoze Gobert's contests. Even Adams, who is pretty unanimously thought of as the NBA's strongest player can't run through Rudy like Zion can."
"No that's not the point...you're just being hard headed at this point. A half seasons worth of raptor is not meant to be predictive. In fact in their methodology page it explicitly draws a distinction between this and a separate predictive raptor, calling this one descriptive. Yeah they have a baity headline but this is clearly only for showing how players are doing this season.  Poetl is playing 24 minutes a game, probably a decent part of which is against the second unit. RAPTOR doesn't account for that, it's not there to use your brain for you it's there to tell what effect players have been having on the game. Poetl is leading the league at opp FG% at the rim. That's a fact. And that'll effect the game hugely whether it's against the first or second unit.  Of course there's heavy team bias in evaluating defense, this is the modern nba. If your defensive scheme sucks then everyone will look like shit. Rudy gobert is looking like a DPOY not because he's the most versatile defender but because the jazz are set up to take advantage of his strengths and hide his disadvantages. You can only evaluate defensive performance in the context of the team. It's the same with poetl. Is that a limitation of RAPTOR? Yeah, the same as every other defensive advanced stat out there which is based off of publicly available data."
"&gt; Yes it does, which models are you comparing it to?  You have to quantify what an outlier is first. But go look at BPM top 10 and tell me which player doesn't belong there.      &gt; None of that is average, and that’s on you for not understanding the context   You are not addressing my reply at all. How is a model useful if the benefit of playing with Rudy Gobert increases your PERSONAL rating with 300-400%?     &gt; Not hard to understand if you don’t realize that the combination on all the injuries and having Enes Kanter as his center makes Lillard’s defense look even worse this year. Again, context   Jesus man, i don't think you understand RAPTOR. RAPTOR is supposed to be an individual stat that accounts for all players on the floor, but using real-plus minus and tracking data. If Lillard's personal rating is affected so greatly by having Kanter than it a trash model for individual evaluation.     I don't know why you have such a hardon for this model, but this is getting ridiculous, your arguments are literally highlighting why the model is bad rather than defending it."
"&gt;	No, no it doesn’t.  Yes it does, which models are you comparing it to?  &gt;	Conley had an average of +1,2 DRAP his last two Grizzlies seasons and now is at 5,0. The model is supposed to evaluate players individually, so if Conley’s defensive value is increased by 300-400% by playing with Rudy Gobert, then the model error makes the model itself worthless.  None of that is average, and that’s on you for not understanding the context   &gt;	This also doesn’t explain Lillard being 35 in raptor behind guys like Montrezz Harrel, Joe Harris and Chris Boucher.  Not hard to understand if you don’t realize that the combination on all the injuries and having Enes Kanter as his center makes Lillard’s defense look even worse this year. Again, context"
"&gt; Not really, RAPTOR has a lot fewer outliers compared to most models   No, no it doesn't.   &gt; Conley has not been average for his career at all that’s a pretty casual take. Conley has always been an all-defensive caliber guard and it’s obvious that his high D-RAPTOR is heavily influenced by sharing the court with gobert a lot. You have to look at context.   The model itself was saying Conley was average, ffs. Stop calling people casual because you can't read.  Conley had an average of +1,2 DRAP his last two Grizzlies seasons and now is at 5,0. The model is supposed to evaluate players individually, so if  Conley's defensive value is increased by 300-400% by playing with Rudy Gobert, then the error model makes the model worthless.   &gt; Rudy and Poetl both play low minutes and mainly play against bench squads.   Poetl has played almost 800 minutes, roughly 200 minutes less than the minutes leader of SAS, and Rudy has played 600. They are the first two guys of the bench. If you are saying the model can't evaluate bench player then that is a different argument. This also doesn't explain Lillard being 35 in raptor behind guys like Montrezz Harrel, Joe Harris and Chris Boucher."
"&gt;	Sure every model has some outliers, RAPTOR just have so many it is pretty concerning.  Not really, RAPTOR has a lot fewer outliers compared to most models  &gt;	When you have someone like Conley who the model has rated pretty average for his entire career, and then the one year he starts for the Jazz he is suddenly the 7’th best defender, suggest that the model is heavily slanted towards team bias.   Conley has not been average for his career at all that’s a pretty casual take. Conley has always been an all-defensive caliber guard and it’s obvious that his high D-RAPTOR is heavily influenced by sharing the court with gobert a lot. You have to look at context.   &gt;	Then there are guys like Poetl, and Gay, this year, and FVV too where their ability just doesn’t match up with their ratings.  Rudy and Poetl both play low minutes and mainly play against bench squads. Again context. And FVV has been really good this season. D-Raptor is generally less reliable than O-RAPTOR, but even D-RAPTOR shows that this is Wiggins best defensive season. But his offense is still clearly very bad."
Yeah he’s not like Rudy Gobert
Ok. Kyrie (+KD and Harden) &gt; Donovan (+Joe Jingles and Rudy can’t hit a post move Gobert). You happy now?
"""Rudy Gobert is out with an illness...""  *[ominous piano music plays]*"
Giannis had the same attitude but he was still pretty stoked about winning it. You can be playing a team game with no focus on individual accolades and still very much care about getting them. Nobody’s ever accused Rudy Gobert of padding his stats or playing selfishly but he still literally cried when he missed out on an All Star nod.
Rudy gobert = best player in nba
"I've missed watching an average of maybe 5 Jazz games/yr, every year, since the Regan Administration.  Gobert was a nightmare for ""Pelicans"" AD, and there is something missing here that's important.  Idk if AD had big games vs Utah when Gobert was injured or during Rudy's rookie year when he wasn't getting mins, but that point average doesn't reflect the norm of Rudy vs. AD matchups w/the Pels since at least 2017.  I don't know how to do this, but if you could pull AD's numbers vs. Utah when Gobert was on the floor, I'm sure they would tell a very different story."
"He’s one of those guys that isn’t the most talented, but is just rare. Kind of like Myles Turner, Rudy Gobert, and Yawcum Perdle."
"This is where casuals really don't get what Gobert does.   Rudy Gobert's primary defensive role is to protect the paint &amp; anchor the defensive scheme, NOT to guard the opposition's 5.  If Quin Snyder told Gobert to play straight 1-on-1 defense against Davis/Jokic/Embiid,etc..., &amp; ignore protecting the paint to stay with the other player, these would be valid criticisms.   But that's not what Utah does.  Instead, they primarily run a sort of modified switching zone, with Gobert guarding the opponents 5 when he's positioned to receive the ball in position to score in the paint, but to switch/leave his man when the 5 moves to the perimeter &amp; position himself to defend the rim.  So when opposing Big's score heavily on Utah, it's generally because of poor rotations to the perimeter by Utah wings, or hot outside shooting nights by bigs.  It's almost never because Gobert couldn't or didnt defend the paint or the individual player well when he was responsible for him defensively."
So Rudy Gobert is the best defensive bigman in the league and also one of the best scoring bigman. Where do you rank him in the NBA?
Rudy Gobert had 66.9 FG% and 15.9 ppg a couple years ago. Which is a higher FG% as well as more PPG than Montrezel Harrel this year. He is putting up similar stats this year and last year as well. Is Rudy Gobert one of the best scoring bigmen in the NBA?
There is no way you seriously think Rudy Gobert can guard Lebron and AD
"The Jazz have Rudy Gobert lmfao  LeBron is 36, he’s bound to regress soon"

Congrats. Rudy Gobert has learned how to get a better front office then Towns. You do know this is a team sport right? The Jazz have always had overall good players in the past couple years along with all stars Donovan/Conley in the past year. KAT would easily be a winner with them.
They said in the broadcast that he has a bigger wingspan than Rudy Gobert... like WTF how bad is he to not get playing time with that natural ability
"That's a great chart. Myles Turner is head and shoulders above the rest of the league, except for Gobert who is in a league of his own. Crazy stuff from Rudy."
And even then rudy gobert is waaaaaay far away from embiid and jokic
"The two of them are by far and away the best centers in the NBA. Who else is even near, Rudy Gobert?"
Rudy Gobert
"I'm pretty sure we all agree that Gobert is the player who is the most vital to our success.  There may be some bandwagoners who have recently joined Jazz Nation because of Donovan's smile or Ingles' breathtaking good looks who don't quite understand this yet, but anyone watching the Jazz all year will almost certainly going say Rudy."

"Watch some nuggets basketball before dropping these trash takes.   I think you meant leads the league* in every game  ""If advanced numbers and analytics are more your speed, you probably don’t even need to be talked into Jokić for MVP. He owns 10.7 win shares, 3.4 more than Giannis Antetokounmpo and Rudy Gobert, who are tied for second in the NBA. It’s the widest win-share margin the league NBA has seen since 2015–16—the year that Warriors star Stephen Curry, who finished the season ahead by 3.4 win shares, became the league’s first unanimous MVP. (Just in case you’re wondering if that’s due solely to the time Embiid and James have missed, it’s not. He holds the edge over Embiid and James—and the rest of the NBA—in win shares per 48 minutes, too.)  More historical context: Jokić’s season [currently ranks as one of the six best of all-time](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/bpm_season.html)—trailing only LeBron’s 2008–09 season, a trio of Michael Jordan campaigns and Curry’s unanimous MVP year—in box plus-minus, which measures a player’s box-score contributions to his team while on the court. While that might seem preposterous on its face, it may not be as far off as you think when looking at everything Jokić excels at within the context of his team, which … [he leads in nearly every conceivable statistic](https://twitter.com/Herring_NBA/status/1374889838298693638?s=20)."""
"It really makes me wonder what backup center we are supposed to acquire beyond Favors is supposed to match the abilities of Gobert. I mean... it's Rudy Gobert, the dude is a 2x DPOY and probably going to get a 3rd. It's hard to be as good as he is at his job."
well... Rudy Gobert is a great defender. This is common knowledge. Rudy Gobert is literally the DPOY frontrunner and has won two already

"Thinking basketball discussed this last year. Bulky rim protectors like Brook Lopez are replaceable, his own brother Robin was able to sustain his impact on defense without much hassle, though it did go down by a tiny margin.  We were best when both Giannis and Brook were on the floor, but we we still the best with Giannis, and middle of the pack without him.  Impact is really subjective, Giannis does a lot of what Embiid does and more. He’s one of the best and statistically the most lethal rim protector in the league. He held opponents to 36.4% at the rim last season; Rudy Gobert and Embiid were in the high 40s"
"[Behold, Rudy Gobert. ](https://youtu.be/tZLD9B_EXas)"
And Rudy Gobert is 10.1
"For real though, his apartment was like a block from the stadium his first year or two here (not sure where he lives now), wouldn't be surprised if he walked to his games. Only reason I know this is I have friends that live in that building, and we'd see Jazz players regularly. Seeing Rudy Gobert pushing a shopping cart is one of my favorite moments, it looked like it only went up to barely above his knee's lmao."
"Lol some of the best shooting teams right now are playing with a non shooter in the starting line up  The Jazz are #1 in 3’s made, 2nd in 3 point percentage, and 3rd in TS%   Yet Rudy Gobert is a horrible shooting centre and can’t space the floor at all  The offense would 100% run through Hakeem anyway  Hakeem was also crazy versatile defensively, both on the perimeter and in rim protection.   Just cause the league moved toward 3 point shooting doesn’t mean that there’s no value in rim protection, and Hakeem would have an insane impact defensively   Peak KD was amazing, but Hakeem arguably had a top 5 peak of all time"

I dare you to make a 3  PG: Ben Simmons SG: Cam Reddish SF: Josh Jackson PF: Giannis C: Rudy Gobert
"I would assume some ridiculous combo of Rudy Gobert and Draymond Green, with even more IQ and athleticism."
Rudy Gobert with a jump shot
He'd be a monster.   * The rim-protecting of Rudy Gobert * The switchability of Bam * The intelligence of Draymond  * The 3rd fastest guy over 6'10 (behind Simmons and Giannis) * The mental fortitude of Kobe/Jordan * Then add in some playmaking (especially in transition)  He's the GOAT defender for a reason.
Myles aint a DPOY candidate lmao. It's a two man race between Gobert and Simmons. Turner is fake good on that end and that specific play of Myles' perimeter defence is what casuals think Rudy is like out there.
PG - Joe Ingles  SG - Donovan Mitchell  SF - Jae Crowder  PF - Paul Millsap  C - Rudy Gobert  Basically a worse version of the current Utah Jazz. We'd likely be a 4-6 seed in the West this season and lose in the first round to the Lakers.
"Np. And by spacing, I'm just referring to his positioning within the offense. His positioning is critical to what Utah does, and Gobert is the most involved player within that offense.   Utah initiates offense with high p&amp;r w/Gobert rolling to the rim, or off-ball/spanish p&amp;r w/Gobert threatening a lob @ the rim. He has to remain a threat at the rim, w/out clogging it up for perimeter ball handlers attacking or drawing defenders towards wings waiting for a 3 attempt.   He's executing everything perfectly. That's why Utah has both the most open 3pt attempts in the nba AND shots at the basket in the NBA this season. Gobert is forcing defenders to guard him and the paint at all times because his finishing at the rim &amp; ft% has been so good.   But he's also been posting up &amp; showing pretty sick iso moves in the paint for the first time ever &amp; has been an excellent passer out of the post too. Also, he's actually taken a few 15-20 ft jumpers from the top of the key this yr too &amp; is getting close to being a threat with that tool. And while he hasn't taken a 3 yet (except a full-court heave at the buzzer), he shoots them in pregame warm-ups &amp; hits em pretty good! So I think the Rudy Gobert 3 is coming!!!"
"&gt; They ran the offense through Tony Parker by 2007  This became true a couple years later but Duncan averaged more points during the regular season and playoffs in 2007. Parker (and Ginobili for that matter) were still very good to fringe all star level players at that point in time, whereas Duncan was still a first team All-NBA type player.  &gt; How is Duncan putting up the same numbers as Kevin Love on the Cavs ""the guy"".  Different era, different scoring averages, different styles of offense, different pace. Also just not true, Duncan averaged 20 points per game 8/9 times from 1999 to 2007, Love never averaged 20 a game in Cleveland and only averaged more than 18 a game once.   &gt; Even when the Spurs had near the best record in the league Tim Duncan wasn't getting any MVP votes from 2005 onwards.  Just factually incorrect, he finished fourth in 2005 and 2007.  &gt; It's like saying Rudy Gobert is the only reason the Jazz are good.  &gt; This year's Jazz is like the closest comparison to those Spurs teams  lol"
"Not really. They ran the offense through Tony Parker by 2007. How is Duncan putting up the same numbers as Kevin Love on the Cavs ""the guy"".

Tbh I’m very high on Mitchell Robinson I want to believe he could one day be better than Rudy gobert by then I start watch the Utah Jazz defensive schemes and then I started watching their games and I’m just wondering is that man the greatest rim protector of all time like when mitch is in the paint people think twice about going in and he always makes sure to make it difficult for them to score but with Rudy he traps players   he uses the players around him to his advantage and plus he also serious makes it difficult for his opponents when they take a shot   But mainly I’m telling there’s more to his defense than just blocks especially on offense his impact is insane on both sides of the floor
"You're right but you can make that claim about anyone.If luka kills kawhi that doesn't make kawhi a bad defender. But tell me this, since you root for the Knicks. Do you really believe mitchell Robinson couldn't do what Gobert does if he played in Utah? Like if Rudy played for the wizards (league worst defense]) would he still be as highly rated as he is in Utah?"
Rudy gobert is a top 5 defender in the league no argument  Your saying he’s not one because he can’t guard the top bigs well who tf can Anthony Davis can’t guard Joel Embiid so I guess he isn’t a good defender   Basically what I’m saying when your going against a superstar or elite scorers it’s a team effort on defense   also Rudy not just a shot blocker he’s actually the best rim protector in the league and rim protecting is not all about getting blocks there’s more to it   And who the hell keep coming up with the stupid that gobert is useless out the paint he’s still a average perimeter defender
"Sometimes guys can get high steal numbers but not be a good defender. Especially now with how many guys turns the ball over, whether if it was from over dribbling or bad passes. For blocks, there are some schemes where perimeter guys over player shooters forcing guys to drive into the center who simply blocks the shot. Rudy gobert is a perfect example of this. He blocks a lot of shots yes, but he isn't actually a great defender. Scoring bigs always play well against him and he isn't good on switching onto wings and guards like an AD."
PG- John Stockton  SG- Pete Maravich  SF- Adrian Dantley  PF- Karl Malone  C- Rudy Gobert
Denver gave Utah both Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert
"Rudy gives that team their identity. Last year, people are making a Rudy Gobert trade rumors because he is spreading covid lol"
"You guys are better than us. We lost cause Rudy Gobert is bad. And yes Jamal Murray is a good young player who can score, but I prefer Shai, honestly."
It seems like the universe is conspiring against Rudy Gobert. What did this guy do in his past life?
"recently rudy said he thinks mitchell can be an all-defense player if he commits to it.   my hope is that he can lock in on defense when its needed. i dont need mitchell to be an all-defense player all the time, hes got a lot of responsibilities of his own, and besides, Gobert is back there to clean up.  BUT again, I hope mitchell can lock in and be an elite defender for stretches of important games"
"The best player on the best team, Rudy Gobert."
"His offensive versatility was irrelevant, all he had to do was continue his defensive greatness and he would have aged extremely well. Even now this late in his career after injuries he's really really good on that end, if he hadn't had back problems he would never have ""declined"" so severely. Also your point about the NBA not being friendly to such big men is dumb. He's a defense first center, is anyone complaining about Rudy Gobert not being versatile enough on offense? He doesn't need to be and neither did Dwight. When you're that dominant on defense then anything you can provide on offense is just a bonus."
I love breakdowns into the more technical side of film. Where you stop it and look at what players are thinking in that exact frame. There really is so much more to basketball than I know. I also just read a comment from another thread stating Rudy is in the 99th percentile of scoring efficiency around the rim. Which leads me to wonder... is Gobert under appreciated?
Agreed and that’s exactly where my opinion of suspect perimeter defense stemmed from. After these responses it makes me feel like I owe Gobert a huge apology because I really didn’t believe he was defensive player of the year material. As you can probably tell I don’t know the more in depth knowledge that goes into coaching a game or building a game plan around one players single specialty. But it’s now clear to me that Rudy brings much more to the table than just shot blocking.
"Rudy Gobert defended the most isolations (most of them on switches against guards/perimeter ballhandlers in the league last year and he allowed 0.66 points per possession on those(good for 90th percentile in the league). This year he's allowing 0.79 points per possession(68th percentile). In 2018-2019 - 0.65 ppp(90th percentile), 2017-2018 - 0.77ppp(77th percentile), 2016-2017 - 0.78 ppp(74th percentile).   Over the last 5 years, he's been not just the best rim protector but also one of the best and most consistent defenders on switches in the league. Yes, he's the best around the rim and that's where his presence is most easily seen and felt, but at this point I welcome almost any guard to iso against Gobert. If you think isoing against Gobert is good option for offenses - bring it on, lets see what happens."
"Not saying this as an insult, its just pretty obvious you start know a lot about the technical side of basketball. Plays, coaching, schemes, etc. Basketball isnt just about putting the best offensive guy on the worst defender.  You cant automatically force Gobert on the perimeter against someone like Curry (even though for a center Gobert is okay on the perimeter) its a lot more complicated than that. (Screens, switches, etc.) There is a reason there is positions, players dont need to guard 1-5. Rim protection is the MOST important skill a center can have and its VERY hard for a center to be elite without it (see Joker) and Gobert is by FAR the best rim protector in the league and of his generation. Gobert is truly one of a kind, he is a 1 man defense. You can put him on a team with 4 piss poor defenders and you will still end up with one of the best defenses in the league, thats how much gravity he has around the rim. A player like Simmons who can guard ""1-5"" doesnt hold as much defensive gravity as Gobert because hes not a big man. Whats better locking down 4 plays one on one in a game like Simmons or every minute you are in the game people are scared to go for a layup like Rudy?"
Rudy gobert
"Probably. Build a team with lots of good shooting and a decent center and I don’t see why they couldn’t be serious contenders with his playmaking. He can’t be the best scorer on your team, but he could be the best player.   For example:  Ben Simmons, Bradley Beal, Mikal Bridges, Tobias Harris, Rudy Gobert.  Simmons is probably the best player on a team like this because Beal sucks so bad at defense, but a team like that could win the championship.  Some of this depends on era too. Are they winning a championship against healthy Brooklyn? No. Could a team like this win absent of a super team (like if the super team gets injured like in 2019, or 2020) sure."
"Boring team. Has Rudy Gobert, one of the most boring “stars” in the league. Mitchell tries, but there’s nothing cool about Utah. Then there’s the racism stuff"
Rudy Gobert caused COVID
Centre. Rudy Gobert is like the third or fourth best centre in the league? He’s great but I mean... he can’t win you a game by himself like some others ahead of him can

"I didn't say this wasn't abot Rubio, I just think we underrate the Gobert part a lot, a crazy good rim protector who could wait for him at the rim with little spacing, especially because Russ has no floater game, the only games in which Russ was good that series were because he was hitting jump shots, and this has way more to do with Rudy than Rubio"
Holmes has played as a 4 until he came to the Kings. He has trouble boxing out and doesn't quite know how to play as a 5 with the specific skills a 5 would traditionally play like post moves and fighting for low post rebounds and stuff. He's also very undersized. He made Poetl look like rudy gobert.
"We used to say that Hayward was invaluable to our success. Then he left and the success didn't. Gobert is our best player by a mile, Mitchell is still a stud and a critical piece of the team but there's no realistic metric that says he's better or more valuable than Rudy."
Damn Rudy Gobert tonight though 🥶
"It's a bizarro-world catch-22.   Nobody really gets how good Rudy is. And nobody really watches Utah play.  Then, Donovan transforms into this cerebral &amp; athletic monster of a guard.  But bcz most Jazz fans &amp; legit analysts keep saying Rudy is Utah's best player, ""joe redditor neffew"" thinks Donovan must not be that good; cuz even Jazz fans think Mitchell&lt;Gobert (who sucks cuz he couldn't defend Steph on the perimeter while injured in the playoffs in 2015)"
"Rudy bends the game in a way literally nobody else does.  It doesn't show up in stat sheets, and it doesn't appear on highlight reels.  The best way I can explain it is that he stretches the dynamics &amp; possibilities of what can happen on the ""Z"" axis of a basketball court-- both offensively &amp; defensively--in a way that no other player can replicate.   And if you remove that variable from this specific Jazz team &amp; system, there isnt another center that could contribute enough in other ways to compensate for what would be lost by removing what Gobert does on a different level."
&gt; The Utah Jazz would be worse with Embiid than they are with Gobert.   No disrespect to Rudy because he’s easily yalls best player and a top 3 center... but how can you honestly believe this? The gap between Embiid and Gobert defensively isn’t enough to make up for the huge gap offensively.
"Gobert is such an unsexy pick, but there's no doubt about it, Utah goes  as  Rudy goes."
"Mitchell on/off: -4.5  Gobert on/off +17  Unless it’s garbage time when Rudy’s off Mitchell’s on and visa versa, so Donovan’s not a net negative by any means but it’s pretty clear who our best player is. And that’s not including tonight where Rudy was +38 and Donovan +8"
"Hmm.  We can start with the field of tier-1 guys. Those who fulfill the following criteria  - Generational / superstar prime counting stats - Best player on a contending team - Unique skillset / hard to replace - Are the fulcrum around which their team operates  That's a pretty short list of guys. By my count, it's Jokic, Embiid, LeBron, and Giannis. Clearly the top caliber of guys who are both nearly impossible to replace with any other player, and who are putting up generational numbers.  Then you have the next tier of guys - people having great years, but might be easier to replace / don't have the same narrative, their stats aren't quite as transcendentally impressive, their team isn't as successful, or there's a black mark on their season and an asterisk you need to consider. This ""tier 2"" of MVPs for me consists of Dame, Steph, Kawhi, and Harden. Kawhi is the best player on a great team, but his counting stats while good aren't *eye-popping*, Harden forced his way out of Houston which hurts his narrative, and Dame and Steph are both on teams that aren't as impressive record-wise as the guys in Tier 1.   After those 8, it's a huge toss-up for me. I would have Gobert, Luka, and CP3 next on that list. In fact, I think the case for CP3 and Gobert is really similar; two guys who have relatively unimpressive counting stats and don't pop out at you when they're on the floor, but who are *insanely* high impact, just in very different ways. And I think that while the top 8 *is* relatively firm in most people's opinions, I personally would not be shocked to see someone like Steph fall out of it since Golden State is no good this year, and if Steph's falling out of the race, I think someone like Gobert or CP3 *is* the guy who would take his place. Every other guy putting up monster numbers on a bad team (like Luka) has the exact same problems as Steph does in terms of making a case for the MVP, so replacing one for the other doesn't make sense to me, if I'm putting myself in the shoes of a voter.  In this exercise, I think the highest I could reasonably put Gobert is at 6th or maybe 5th, but I don't think I could in good conscience keep him out of the top 10. Let's say Lebron and Embiid both missthe rest of the season and they're not even in the top 10, and you decide you don't want to reward Steph for being a good stats bad team kind of guy. You don't want to put Harden on your ballot because he forced his way out of Houston (or maybe that bumps him down a few slots). And now all the sudden, Rudy Gobert is in your top five.   I don't expect this will happen for *many* voters; there might be a cheeky 3rd place vote or two sent his way from people who want to make sure his impact is recognized, and maybe he could sneak his way into 6th or 7th if the Jazz peel off a crazy run at the right time and he's playing at his best. But anything more than that is just being a little too optimistic. Rudy is insanely high impact, but he's not putting up good counting stats, there's no great media narrative in his favor this year (even though the Corona Redemption arc and the blown lead in the bubble arc do kind of write themselves), he's a small-market guy, and he's not a flashy player, and even if he is doing historic stuff on the defensive end of the floor, that's not the top priority of most of the voters."
+15 margin is insane  thats rudy gobert levels of +/-
&gt;It involves having rudy gobert
"Jokic is perfectly capable of doing this. He's a fantastic shooter, great touch from everywhere. Put 18 assists on the Rockets this year without breaking a sweat, literally just decided he wanted to pass the whole game. Had a 30, 20, and 10 assist game against Rudy Gobert last year with a game winner for the cherry on top. Jokic could get this stat line."
Someday I’m going to be bragging to my children that I got to watch Rudy Gobert in his prime
I literally made a video about this. Gobert doesn’t make the threes but he opens up his teammates:  How Rudy Gobert creates shots for his teammates - 4 threes Gobert's roll opened up vs Charlotte https://youtu.be/owAPqsVAYiw
"IIRC, Rudy Gobert was the last time a first rounder was sold for cash. I think it happened with the rights to Rajon Rondo as well."
Rudy Gobert  First seed in the toughest conference and according to Jazz fans by far their most important player

"/r/NBA refuses to accept anything good about Rudy Gobert, but I appreciate the effort."
Lol. Seeing this out of left field kinda reminds me of Chris Bosh’s all star self-marketing when he was on the raptors.   Are you Rudy Gobert?  Are you Rudy’s
"Because the players you’re referencing are nowhere near as good today as they were at the time of signing their contracts. The contracts you’re referring to where teams “have to” overpay their guys are generally only marginal overpays and somewhat justifiable at the time of signing the contract. They’re generally not worth the totality of their contracts but most of the time they’re worth something like 80-90% of it. It Blake Griffin was playing at a level where you’d feel comfortable paying him something close to the $34 million he was making, he wouldn’t have been bought out. It’s only because he’s so far from being that player that the Pistons even considered letting him go for nothing.  Like, Rudy Gobert is a slight overpay. There is 0 chance he gets bought out."
Rudy Gobert for MVP 😭😂😂😂😂
Jokic’s play style is also perfectly suited to highlight the flaws in BPM. He’s not the 5th best defender in the NBA above Rudy Gobert as DBPM says

"You'll get downvoted, but Donovan Mitchel and Rudy Gobert have proved much more than PG has in years.   Paul George is not anywhere near super stardome."
"I'm so confused. Does Gasol just not exist for most Laker fans? Drummond is a below average post defender and just as immobile as Gasol. Marc is one of the best post defenders in the league, a way better matchup for Jokic.   Against Gobert Drummond will compromise the spacing and Gobert will shut down the Lakers just like he did in February. Against the Jazz, the Lakers need to play five shooters when Gobert is on and Harrell needs to play every minute that Gobert sits. Drummond will also give up offensive rebounds to Gobert because he never boxes out and can't win his customary jumping contest against Rudy."
"Make Rudy Gobert 8'2"""
"&gt;I enjoy the challenge small markets get because it forces them into building the right way, so you get teams like Phoenix, Utah, and Denver putting together competitive teams that can potentially give super teams problems.  Spoilers; they won't. This is heartwarming to ponder in your head, but if healthy, nobody 'homegrown' is fucking with the Lakers and certainly not the Nets.  Not to sound corny, but yall deserve better; you shouldn't have to be in a position to give Rudy Gobert a max because you have no better alternatives in the near future. Maybe one solution could be reducing the cap hit that some maxes/supermaxes have when you give them to homegrown talent that's been with you for a long time, which *ideally* would help small market teams"
"Vintage DeAndre Jordan, current Rudy Gobert, sometimes Clint Capela. Guys who create space in the pick and roll by rolling hard to the rim. No postups, just screens, dunks, and rebounds on offense."
See: Rudy Gobert.
"First of all, yeah, I fucked up and was trying to recall from memory Rudy goberts all nba selections and didn’t realize he has 3. Still though, I for sure would not say gobert is better on offense. No matter what, it is helpful for your big to be able to space the floor. Rudy is great in defense, but all the bigs that people consider better than him can shoot like embiid, jokic, Anthony Davis. Horford, like you mentioned, is also a great play maker for a big and on top of that, was also a great, though not dpoy level defender. However, as I mentioned, horford is probably a better match up defensively against certain teams than gobert. I think if all 30 teams could have the option to take a prime horford or a gobert, there would definitely be some teams that would see horford as a better modern big and more teams now a days would be able to utilize him more effectively in the way teams are starting to play. More teams would take gobert though I imagine"
"That's not it at all. The screen assists thing was our radio guy, David Locke, trying to make screen assists a big deal to try to quantify Gobert's involvement in our offense. There was a stretch where after every game he would tweet stat lines like ""Rudy Gobert with 15 points, 15 rebounds, and 19 SCREEN ASSISTS."" These tweets got picked up by the rest of NBA twitter and clowned because they thought what he was trying to say was that screen assists are equal to normal assists in a stat line.  Which is also the misconception that the OP of the original comment appears to have had. Rudy Gobert isn't a normal basketball player so its hard to quantify his impact and involvement in a game like normal players. The point of bringing up screen assists isn't to say that they're equal to normal assists, its just to try to show that Rudy is heavily involved in the offense and makes an impact. I don't think any Jazz fans would bring it up if not for dumbasses calling Rudy a liability on offense when people who watch every Jazz game can clearly see what he brings to the table."
"Also, with you being a jazz fan, it’s actually hilarious that you call Al Horford barely a star. Al Horford has a lot of the same credentials that Rudy gobert has. They both have 1 all team third nba, both are great defenders. Gobert is the better overall defender obviously, but Horford honestly has some great qualities on defense that make him maybe more valuable against more perimeter centric teams, and Horford is a floor spacer on offense and has a better offensive game. I feel like you under rate Al Horford similarly to how many under appreciate gobert"
Why do y’all act like he’s Rudy Gobert or Clint Capela lmao?
been calling rudy G”flu-dy  gobert” even since he touched all the mics in his presser
Hes a great defender but fucking Rudy Gobert is not the greatest regular season defender of all time
Rudy &gt; Wallace.   Both all time greats defensively. Wallace though was an offensive liability and likely the worst FT shooter in league history. Gobert is much much more valuable offensively and servicable at the line for a C.
I know im going to get shit for this but I think Rudy Gobert got wayyyyyy to much hate for the mic touching thing......People were calling for his fucking head. At that point almost everyone I know didnt think or know that the Coronavirus was going to be what it was. Once the season actually shut down is when I knew shit was real.
Billups= Jrue Holiday RIP= Demar Derozan Prince= Kyle Anderson Rasheed = Paul Milsap Wallace =  Rudy Gobert?
Mike Conley   Donovan Mitchell   Royce O’Neal  Bojan Bogdanovic   Rudy Gobert
Ben Wallace = Rudy Gobert ???
"Marc Gasol ranks 4th in D-Lebron this season behind only Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, and Clint Capela.   You can doubt the metric if you want, but this is clearly not a 2015 Peyton Manning situation where every stat is saying this QB is terrible now."

Luka had 1 of his worst games of the year being guarded by AG when he was w ORL. And the Nuggs could beat any team in the West any given series still. ESPECIALLY the Jazz. Rudy Gobert is Jokic’s son
Joker eats Rudy Gobert for breakfadt any day. Only issue is Don. Mpj gotta step up defensively and we will be fine
I'll say Rudy Gobert
"In thinking about it, I dont see the value in trading him, especially given his upside. He is too talented physically to not, at the very least, provide rim protection and guard bigger 5s. His floor in year 2 for me is probably like Javale McGee. On a rookie contract, and considering you have other valuable assets to trade, I think I gamble on this dude becoming an elite defender, closer to Rudy Gobert. The reward out weighs the risk here."
He's been Rudy Gobert with 45 inch vertical for us
Jokic. Chris Paul/Rudy Gobert. Then Giannis.
"Yeah I mean my point isnt really to get into the specifics of who's better Trae vs Capela it doesnt matter to me(I do actually think it's still Trae). Point is more it's an actual convo and the fact that's the case is what's driving their success. It's a watered down version of Donovan Mitchell vs Rudy Gobert even if in Utah's case I think Gobert is better. This is basically the actualized version of him yeah, kind of tailor made for a role of turning a bad/mediocre team into an above average one. He's the only reason this defense isnt a total abomination."
Drummond is not a quality option. You are delusional if you think Rudy fucking Gobert and Donovan Mitchell are going to be competitive against LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
"This proves that Utah Jazz and Spurs (big 3 era) got a lot in common.  Tim Duncan  = Rudy Gobert (great defender)  Manu Ginobli = Joe Ingles(great 6th man, can run 2nd unit)  Tony Parker = Jordan Clarkson (Can steal your girl)"
Legendary post scorer Rudy Gobert with his insane array of post moves and beautiful shooting touch
"Fwiw Gobert is top 5 in most impact stats (and top 2 in several) for the team with the best record. Leads the league in FG%, blocks, rebounds, +\- and on/off while only missing 1 game. I’ve seen people try and put CP3 in the convo because raw ppg doesn’t capture his impact, in which case Rudy should definitely be up there. I doubt he’ll get more than a couple token 4th and 5th place votes but he’s got a surprisingly strong statistical case if you look at more than points."
"This RAPTOR is nice and has value, but I'm not quite there yet.     He does a lot that doesn't show up in the stats used.  Either they're intangible, a worthy metric has not been found, or simply not used in the data set of only publicly available data. Nor does it account for coaching, system, teammate synergy, injuries. Much of his value is how much more he is responsible on defense compared to other stars. Plus the variance year to year and small sample sizes.   The RAPTOR definitely makes me go hrmmm, but not enough to write off playoff Rudy Gobert."
"Is Rudy Gobert on your bench? If so, bench Kanter and start Gobert."
"Gah damn - Demarcus Cousins going 4/17 for 13 points, Rudy Gobert going 4/5 for 13 points, and the warriors still won"
"Welp, you did it again.   You used a lot of words to try &amp; sound smart, but it only gave us all more opportunity to show how stupid you are.  For example: Gobert's success vs. Murray was cuz Murray took a stupid shot, NOT bcz Rudy played good defense  Also: Gobert doesnt defend elite guards cuz Utah won't regularly allow him to switch onto them (with heavy implication that's bcz he can't)   ... Neither of those make sense--esp. in context of this video--but go ahead &amp; think I just ""didnt read"" your post."
"Same reason Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and Rudy Gobert aren't. He isn't good enough. No way MVP can be like the 15th best player"
I mean whos gonna win rudy gobert? Lol
I'm pretty sure this guy hasn't watched a second of USC basketball cuz Evan's handle is actually not that bad and his touch around the rim is other worldly.  This dude is acting like he's a Rudy Gobert prospect.
"Stats are one thing though, actually winning series is another. And yes man, that is usually how I compare players is by their playoff performance, if you didn’t than Rudy Gobert would look like a super star"
"Bro, Houston literally targeted his inability to guard the perimeter in the series they played. I have proof of this. Like i said he can guard the George Hills or maybe even guys like Westbrook because they aren’t super deadly 3 level scorers. His stats do drop off in the playoffs: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/jbt7yl/does_rudy_gobert_lose_his_defensive_value_in_the/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body  Over the past 4 regular seasons Rudy Gobert's Defensive metrics:  Defensive Box Plus/Minus\~ 2.2  Defensive Player Impact Plus/Minus\~ 4.4(1st in the NBA)  Jacob Goldstein luck-adjusted Defensive On/Off\~ 4.16(5th in the NBA)  Gobert Defensive net-rating- 104.84 on court 108.58 off court= +3.74  Past 4 post-seasons  Defensive Box Plus/Minus\~ 1.5  Defensive Player Impact Plus-Minus\~ 0.93(41st in the NBA)  Jacob Goldstein luck adjusted Defensive On/Off\~ -1.73(81st in the NBA)  Gobert Defensie net-rating- 112.97 on court 105.48 off court= -7.49  That scheme isn’t switching Gobert onto the perimeter though, thats drop coverage which Gobert is excellent at executing but in the playoffs drop coverage centers become very difficult to play because of guys like Curry, Lillard or Murray who only need a sliver of daylight and you must face those kinds of offensive players to win on the highest level.   Then theres his lack of mobility on the perimeter which plays right into a team like Houston’s hands.   Im not saying govert isnt effective in the regular season but the playoffs are a completely different ball game and you need switchable swiss army knives to maintain defensive impact/efficiency.  I dont hate Gobert, i just dont think hes the nba’s best defender.   My argument is not based on KD saying he easy to score on, i mentioned it because the guy i was responding to said teams feared Gobert and i was just saying thats not a given in the playoffs. They fear his rim protection but thats not the same as fearing him as a defensive player"
"But Utah is willing to concede those switches **because** Gobert is good at defending the perimeter. I understand that AD is good at switching and is no question an all time great defender, but the numbers literally say that Gobert is the best defender the past 3 seasons - even on switches onto quicker players. If you watch Utah's defensive scheme, our wings go over the screens to prevent 3's and allow Gobert to contest anything that gets past them. And it's obviously effective seeing as we're consistently a top defense. Just because KD said that it's easy to score on him doesn't mean anything.... NBA coaches literally game plan specifically to deal with Gobert's presence. OP might be biased but a lot of people hate Gobert and their biases creep into evaluating him. Not saying that's the case with you, but your argument is based on KD saying he's easy to guard and that Utah's defense tries to avoid switches onto Rudy (Which is untrue)"
Lots of stars aren't close with each other like that. Steph and Klay are basically opposite people in their personal lives and aren't very close off the court. Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell aren't best buds or anything either. Same with Simmons and Embiid.
Rudy Gobert would be a hall of famer in the 60’s
Rudy Gobert a top 5 paid player in the league
Its not my stat. It was an article on SBnation  [https://www.slcdunk.com/the-downbeat-latest-jazz-news/2021/4/19/22391750/can-rudy-gobert-accomplish-what-no-player-has-in-nba-history](https://www.slcdunk.com/the-downbeat-latest-jazz-news/2021/4/19/22391750/can-rudy-gobert-accomplish-what-no-player-has-in-nba-history)  Also I understand the skepticism. Especially since its not my stat and you are all being pretty civil with it so its fine
"&gt; So the coaches switched things, and instead of Bojan getting to play all of his minutes with Rudy, Conley is. And FUNNY, this year we're worried about Bojan struggling. Coincidence? Maybe not. MAYBE NOT. Maybe it all stems from who gets to play with Rudy! Crazy, but it's true.""  Bogdanovic has a 36.9 3P% in 1113 minutes with Gobert and 40.1% in 685 minutes without Gobert.

He’d be less mobile better offensive Rudy Gobert
"I got you. I’ll go by the positions they are playing this year.

Rudy Gobert it is
Rudy Gobert lost my respect with the whole microphone Covid debacle
"That's because Rudy Gobert sucks as a person. Just look at his flippant, ignorant attitude about COVID in that clip of him rubbing the mics.   Everything I've ever heard about Rudy would make me never want to hang out with him."
Kind of reminds me of Rudy Gobert. He doesn't seem to have that many close connections in the NBA besides Vucevic and a few others. And I doubt he hangs out with Mitchell off the court.
"great work. Rudy is lowkey my favorite defender in the league (after Dray). His teammates just have to protect the perimeter, cause its sure as heck that no one is going to the rim. He is the perfect example of what our rookie James Wiseman need to learn from. Although he does have good lateral quickness, Gobert seems to not play guard-style defense in a 1v1 on the perimeter (unlike Wiseman). Rudy even lets his defender beat him, just to recover and block him in a crazy fashion. His timing is perfect. As a defensive purist, it is incredibly good to see. Reminds me of how the spurs used to push the offense towards Duncan who would just eat everything thrown at him.  Gobert is also a very underrated defender on the perimeter: Sure as OP said, a guy Steph will make him look ike a fool at times by crossing him around the 3 point line and making a contested shot (he does this to majority of the league lol), but don't think Rudy will be afraid of stepping up. I've seen him contest and even block Steph's all time quick release (*cough cough\* Embiid)*.  If I'd give anybody consideration for MVP, it's gotta be Gobert. I hope they go deep in the playoffs: if defense wins championship, it's time they unleash Rudy and win it all. My fellow frenchie is a baller and I wish him the best. ""Vas-y Rudy !"""
He had dumb fouls in his first year but he’s been getting better at seeing his matchup’s strengths and weaknesses. He doesn’t go for pump fakes as much and tries his best to keep his matchup in front.   Defenders who allow the lowest shooting percentage in the NBA:  Matisse Thybulle - 38.0% Ben Simmons - 41.7% Rudy Gobert - 42.8%  Thybulle is also:  1st in defensive +/- 1st in steal % 1st in deflections 3rd in defensive rating 9th in total steals 186th in minutes per game
Rudy Gobert and it isn't close
Rudy gobert 100% not even because im biased but he would help your team more than westbrook. The stuff he does just isnt on the stat sheet
In a universe where Rudy Gobert doesn't exist there are probably several players who might get DPOY votes.
"Mitchell is fantastic but he's not consistent. He's three heart of the team, he's a flashy scorer, and he's deserving of All NBA and some MVP votes, and yet he's still not Rudy. It's less about what Mitchell is and more about what y'all are missing about Gobert."

"It has largely nothing to do with Mitchell. It's got to do with other teams' fans and analysts who don't watch the team and push Mitchell as the Jazz' best player and face of the team because he scores the most points and at the same time minimizing and underrating the effect Gobert has. It's a pushback against false narratives. And sometimes it indeed comes out as us having some type of problem with Mitchell, which is not the case. I personally absolutely love Mitchell and I love having him as one of the faces of our franchise. Absolute class act and a great player...   ...but...  The reality is there is ONE constant in Jazz' success since 2014. And that constant has been Rudy Gobert. Go back and look at all the impact stats.  Wins with/without certain players. From the moment Gobert entered the starting unit in 2014 ousting two former top 3 picks in Kanter and Favors, he's been our best player. The Jazz win when Gobert plays and are mediocre to bad team when he doesn't play. No other player on this team has anything resembling that impact. The Jazz were winning without Hayward but with Gobert on the floor, the Jazz are winning now without Mitchell or Conley or anyone as long as Gobert is on the floor. The Jazz lose(or are barely .500 team) when Gobert sits. This has been the story of this team for the last 7 years. That's not to say Mitchell doesn't have his role and we don't need him. We absolutely need him and we are better team with him than without him, but his impact is nowhere close to Gobert's impact."

Anyone still clowning on Rudy Gobert are sad individuals

I think he has an argument, but it isn’t easily."
Come on.... he’s way more athletic then Rudy Gobert.
Daniel Gafford is Rudy Gobert on a rookie scale contract change my mind
"  &gt;	Gobert is for sure better than Noah on offense. Noah was a better playmaker, but Rudy is one of the best roller, screen setters and offensive rebounders in the league.   That doesn’t make him better than Noah at his peak on offense. Gobert has zero creation skills on offense."
"Gobert is for sure better than Noah on offense. Noah was a better playmaker, but Rudy is one of the best roller, screen setters and offensive rebounders in the league. He had an offensive jump this season with his aggression and imo it's his diving that has been freeing up all the jazz offense. And defensively it's gobert no doubt. Noah was a dpoy in an era where, being honest, the defenders pool was not top heavy at all. Rudy is an all time defender and is in the likes of Mutumbo, Wallace and mourning, although no one will ever give him the credit for it"
Prime Noah was an incredible defender and a great passer. He'd be around Rudy Gobert tier
Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons  Paul George and Doc Rivers (or PG and Seth Curry)  Lance Stephenson and Lebron
Rudy Gobert  David Thompson  Joe Dumars  Jrue Holiday  DeAndre Ayton (mostly relative to his draft class) or Draymond
Just gonna leave this here in case you forgot about it  How Rudy Gobert creates shots for his teammates - 4 threes Gobert's roll opened up vs Charlotte https://youtu.be/owAPqsVAYiw
Rudy Gobert is going to win MVP?
"True but RAPTOR does seem to overrate centers, unless we really do think Clint is the 6th most impactful player in the league and Rudy Gobert is number 2 lol."
They get swept by the Nets. Rudy Gobert would get played off the floor.
Possibly? Prime Shaq played at just short of 300 pounds and was freakishly athletic for that size. He has 20 pounds and about an inch on him. If Shaq got the ball on the block I don't think he is keeping him from throwing it down. I admit probably better than any other center. Nobody else has enough size. Even Rudy Gobert is only 245.
Yeah I always thought he was alot closer to Hakeem than Shaq. But when youre comparing someone to Shaq it isnt about stylistics as much as just as being a domineering presence physically and mentally and how you impose yourself on the opposition.   He was just fundamentally a different body type/build 5 years ago. Like youll hear people talk about how he can get beat in the pick and roll and defending on the perimeter and talk about him like its Rudy Gobert.....nobody wouldve said that about him 5 yrs ago with how he moved. The combination of violence + quickness at his size with what his body composition used to be it was the type of thing you could go 30 yrs without seeing again.
Above Rudy Gobert but lower than Seth Curry
"First of all, I said *ranking*, not ""rating"". And they [are #1 ranked](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/defense/?sort=W&amp;dir=-1)  I'm aware they are 4th in the ratings. They are first in ""rankings"" cuz they lead the league in ""garbage time""--since they're dump-trucking half their opponents so bad that Gobert &amp; starters are sitting much of the 4th qtr.  But the undisputed FACT is this: Utah Jazz lineups w/Rudy Gobert on the floor are the best in the league defensively (and offensively) this season, &amp; it's not particularly close either.   That being said, idk what this hate boner is so many people have for Gobert, where they literally can't accept that he's the best defender in the league.  But even more bizarre is people like you who think it's somehow a knock on Rudy or the Jazz that they're OnLy RaNkEd FoUrTh in defensive ratings--as if that would be anything to be upset about in any scenario--let alone when you've got the league's #1 offense &amp; don't necessarily need to play great defense to win???"
Rudy Gobert didn’t do shit against Murray and Jokic in the playoffs last year also.   Postseasons are where legacies are made
"I just think that you can’t separate Gobert from the Jazz defense. It’s all structured on running shooters off the 3 point line towards Rudy.   So ya if you take away Rudy from the paint, obviously it’s not going to perform as well. And they would probably restructure their defense."
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19. Bam Adebayo 20. Donovan Mitchell  21. Kyrie Irving 22. Ben Simmons 23. Rudy Gobert  24.  Jamal Murray  25. Zion Williamson  26. Trae Young  27. Zach LaVine 28. Russell Westbrook  29. Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
"I keep hearing people ask why Booker or CP3, or Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert, are not ""at least in the conversation.""   If someone want to make a case for one of those guys being the MVP, go right ahead. I'd like to hear it. Otherwise, they're not in the conversation. We don't pick MVP honorable mentions. If someone can't get a first place vote, they're not really in it."
&gt; Rudy Gobert  &gt; under the radar
"Eric Gordon, D’Angelo Russell, Buddy Hield, Klay Thompso, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert"
"Dunk attempt with his dick would still get blocked by Rudy ""Cock Block"" Gobert"
"He doesn't impact winning in the way of a traditional center which makes it hard to categorically place him at the level of hakeem, shaq, garnett, duncan, kaj or davis.    When you combine his savant level playmaking, however, he is in the same conversation in terms of his impact on the game.   Wilt isn't remotely close to the playmaker Jokic is and he had no offensive stretch ability.   In the modern nba ""Wilt the Stilt"" would basically be Rudy gobert with less lateral mobility and more bounce."
"you also have to remember this: just because you have vaccine doesn't mean you are immune to the virus, that means your chances of having the disease to the point you have to go to hospital drop significantly.  Or use this comparison: just because you have body armor, that doesn't mean you won't get hurt if someone shot you, it just hurt...""less"".  Beside, with so many ppl still not vaccinated, do you really want to run the risk of getting COVID even with the vaccine?  Just ask Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert how they feel now, long-haul COVID is real, don't risk it."
"LeBron absolutely does not make less than Gobert.    Rudy's extension kicks in next year.  Rudy, this year: $26,775,281  LeBron, this year: $39,219,566    Rudy, next year: $34,844,000  LeBron, next year: $41,180,544"
"Gobert is only half way through a career that you specifically said started off slow.  I'd be careful about making assumptions like ""not a first-ballot HOF-er"", etc....on a guy that's proven to continually improve, develop &amp; exceed expectations at every turn.  If Rudy ends his career w/5+ DOPY's &amp; a championship and/or a couple Finals runs (which seems quite possible at this point), he'll be a first ballot HOFer.  I've been watching the NBA for a long time &amp; Rudy Gobert is the most dominant &amp; impactful defensive force I've ever seen play the game."
"Yes, small market teams often have to do that.   What I'm saying is that Rudy Gobert is not ""that guy"". He is as positively impactful &amp; dominant as any player in the NBA, &amp; worth his contract.   He does it with sublime defensive play &amp; off-ball offensive play, and he does it in Utah-- where nobody get to see him or hear about him enough to understand or appreciate just how good he is-- so his greatness flies under-the-radar.  But make no mistake, Rudy Gobert is worth every penny he's earning, whether Shaq or anybody else understands it or not."
"&gt;Rudy could be synonymous to defense if he keeps locking people from the paint few more years.   Tim Duncan? Ben Wallace? Rudy isn't synonymous to defense until he wins a chip with his defense. Not trying to get Gobert with the ring argument, but he needs to do it in the playoffs like these dudes first before he becomes ""synonymous""."

"But for current day:  Starters: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Rudy Gobert  Bench: Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Julius Randle, Nikola Jokic"
"Lakers go from 37/60 with 8 shooting fouls inside the arc on Saturday to 19/44 with 5 shooting fouls when Gobert came out tonight, lol. Give Rudy some MVP votes goddamnit."
CAN YOU IMAGINE TRYING TO SCORE A BASKET AGAINST RUDY GOBERT LOL
"The thing about Rudy is he is the only player to ever play in the D-League and get all-NBA honors.  When Gobert came into  the league he was getting 10 minutes per game. Gobert was not in the top 10 for rookie of the year.    When Shaq was in college, people knew he was a generational talent.  He was an all-star and rookie of the year.    Gobert worked his \*ss off to get to be an all-NBA player while Shaq started there as a rookie.  The only players who were 1st pick, Rookie-of-the-year, 1st ballot hall-of-famers like Shaq in the last 30 years are LeBron, Duncan, Iverson, and Kidd.  Gobert is an elite player, but he's not a top-25 guy all time."
That's not bringing up win-loss record. That's saying shooting percentage isn't the only stat that dictates if someone is playing well against someone else  &gt;Which is why Anthony Davis has a losing record against Rudy Gobert? Lmao  That's you bringing up direct records. Not me
"Yeah, AD is going to dominate 2 time DPOY Rudy Gobert in his first game back in like 2 months lol."
Anthony Davis dominates Rudy Gobert*  *When Rudy Gobert is forced to guard another center and Anthony Davis has LeBron James on his team
Which is why Anthony Davis has a losing record against Rudy Gobert? Lmao
"Rudy Gobert, Mike Conley and Derrick Favors are AVAILABLE. Ersan Ilyasova is OUT."
"&gt; and the league as a whole especially over the past 2 years has seen a noticeable increase in ft%  My claim above is that this is due to a greater percentage of free throws being shot by perimeter players.  The increase in FT shooting accuracy occurs precisely as league-wide 3PA skyrockets starting in 2016-2017 after Curry makes 400 3s in a season on the best team offense in league history.  It is certainly not driven by a handful of low volume big men like Drummond or Jordan figuring out how to shoot FT at a somewhat serviceable level.  And for every Drummond or Jordan there are plenty of players like Dwight Howard, Tim Duncan, Giannis Anteteokounmpo, Rudy Gobert, even Russell Westbrook or LeBron James, who are marginal-to-bad free throw shooters but don't appear to have gotten any of the benefits of 'modern coaching'.  It's certainly possible that Shaq might have taken that coaching and benefitted from it -- shooting FT at 75% would have easily made him the greatest peak player in league history -- but it's far from a given.  &gt; There aren't any sub 50% high volume shooters left   There was only one in Shaq's era as well -- Shaq!  [In the year he won MVP there was only 1 other sub 60% FT shooter in the top 100 players by FT attempts -- Jason Caffey at 59%.](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=FTA&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=1999-00&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season)"
"I don’t think he’s wrong though, Gobert was just a dude until he put in that work. He doesn’t express it properly but not everybody can be a star, any tall dude that really *wants* to put in that work could model their game after Rudy because it doesn’t take some generational offensive skill set. Obviously hard to be as good as Rudy though but that’s not what he’s saying."
And Shaq is arguably a top 5 player ever. His play and fame is what allows players like Gobert to make such large amounts of money now. 50 years from we will still talk about Shaq. Rudy? No. I can somewhat understand what Shaq is coming from.
"It's really the dishonest argument that gets me. He says he dropped 42 on Gobert as part of his DPOY talk in an interview(he dropped 9 on him but it doesn't matter), but the reporter brings up Kyrie scoring as much as he did and he immediately justifies it with +/- and the W. Guess what Jazz won the Philly game and Rudy was +20 or something."
"It's also about defensive strategy, where are you trying to stop the ball. Jokic knows he's not a great rim defender and works harder at positional defense to stop the ball getting to the rim.  Rudy Gobert has defended nearly 100 more attempts at the rim. Embiid only 20% less despite playing only 2/3 as many games. All that even with Nuggets below average perimeter defense.    Yes, Jokic is absolute a poor rim defender, but defense doesn't only happen at the rim."
"I apologize in advance for plugging my own content, but I made a video breaking down some of the stuff he does that doesn’t show up on the stats sheet in case anyone is interested:  Rudy Gobert The Anti-Stat - 3 Plays He Impacted On Each End Without Getting A Single Stat https://youtu.be/d603A905dUA"
The debate between who's more important between Mitchell and Gobert alone will make it so that there will never be an agreeance on if Rudy is a top 5 player or not
"Raptor rates Mike Conley and Rudy Gobert as top 5 players in impact, and Clint Capela as better than LeBron and KD. Obviously, if all advanced metrics point to a player being really good then he probably is (Gobert) I just think they don't mean much beyond that"
"Mitchell was pick number 13. Rudy Gobert was 27th  Booker was pick number 13, they traded away a future pick for CP3 (which means a shorter competitive window)  Denver picked Jokic in the second round. Murray was 7th.   And yet none of them have even a WCF win to show for it. And do you expect any of them to win the finals? If so, your opinion isn’t the most popular.   Regardless, you’ve shown you’re incorrect on a multitude of your points so I think this conversation is over. Have a good one."
I'm sure your username has nothing to do with your opinion.   Embiid is Rudy Gobert lite in the way that he locksdown the paint and teams thinking twice before even driving into the paint while he is there while AD's main strength is his mobility and switchability.  But I do think Embiid provides more value.
Where did you get Rudy is much better as a scorer? Gobert is 12 ppg scorer. Mostly on lobs. Simmons is 16 ppg and can create his own shot.  Better at defense how? Gobert is a paint anchor but not great on the perimeter and cannot effectively switch on gaurds meanwhile Simmons can gaurd inside and out and has a variety of positions he can be on. Only guy on the league that can gaurd anyone one of the nets stars.
"Donovan size boost. 6'4"" Donovan would be strong as fuck, super athletic and a much better finisher at the rim so more efficient.   Skill boost for Rudy Gobert clearly. If rudy had a better offensive repertoire he could probably be prime Dwight level IMO.   Athleticism is kinda tough, I wanna say Joe ingles because he's so slow. He's super versatile and intelligent, if he was a little more explosive he'd be able to create his own shot better and be a bigger threat to defenses. But I think maybe the better answer is Bogdanovic. He is already a good pure scorer who can get super hot, he's not a bad athlete but bring him up one more notch and he'd be lethal."
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."
"I mean, that sounds impressive but when you really look at it, it's obvious why. Westbrook at 6'3"" will be contested on more rebounds than Rudy Gobert who has a near 10' standing reach."
Rudy Gobert is currently averaging more uncontested rebounds than 2016-17 Russ
Yes. Peak Dwight is better than Rudy Gobert would ever be
Please don't disrespect Rudy Gobert like that
The Rudy Gobert thread was as bad as any Twitter troll cesspoy
I wouldn't call Utah inexperienced.  They still had the coaching and Rudy Gobert was always present same as Favors.  Outside of George Hill and Gordon Hayward they still maintained the frontcourt foundation.  Plus Russ had an all time terrible supporting cast that year.  But more than anything I was talking about his regular season not his postseason.  That's a different story but if we want to talk postseason we can talk 2016 when he outplayed KD in the 2016 West finals.
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."

He's being shit on a lot already so Rudy Gobert. He'll be a 3x DPOY and many time all defensive
"&gt;Roster construction doesn't determine the effort they are willing to put into the game when it's being played. THAT falls onto the head coach.  A great coach will build his system around his players, not expect to fit his players into a system.   The Jazz got very lucky with Donovan Mitchell, and to a lesser extent Rudy Gobert, but outside of that Quin Snyder has turned the Jazz into a group 10x the sum of their parts. If you track it from George Hill, to Ricky Rubio, and then Mike Conley the Jazz essentially traded 5 first round picks to finally land a fit with Conley. That leaves us filling our roster with undrafted or unwanted players. Ingles, O'Neale, Niang, Ilyasova, Forrest, Oni, are all playing great basketball and it should all be to Snyder's credit. Clarkson is playing the best basketball of his career because Snyder built a system to take advantage of his talent.  Stevens is a good coach, but he's had this golden boy status for a few years and I never felt like he deserved it. I've always been a bit jealous and salty over Steven's rep because I've always felt Snyder is a better coach and underappreciated."
"As previously noted...  One should apply some era adjustment to this efficiency statistic. Interior defense in the NBA is worse than it ever has been, by leaps and bounds.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four all-time in effective FG% in the NBA. All are obviously active players. Of the top 20 all-time, 12 are active."
"Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudmire, Shawn Marion, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Nikola Jokic, Manu Ginobilli, Tony Parker, Scottie Pippen, Paul George, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Joakhim Noah, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady...  That should be about 30 player drafted after the top 3 (which is the goal of tanking) and most of them have been late lottery picks, even some second rounder.  All these players let your franchise be a contender, or at least compete for the second round.  Sure you could nitpick on guys like Shawn Marion, AK47 or even Dray and Manu, but all these players are a product of clever drafting over mindless tanking for the first pick."
"Fuck Rudy Gobert, whole season ova"
"Fine. If Rudy Gobert is the finals MVP, he's not anywhere close to top 5 center of all time. He's not even close to being on the same level as Bill Russell, Wilt, Kareem, Shaq, Hakeem, Ewing etc. If he wins FMVP then he's probably top 20, MAYBE top 15."
"&gt;The Jazz defense is great and they have a better team defensive system, but typically when Rudy Gobert leaves the key, bad things happen. If you've watched the Sixers this year, Embiid doesn't leave the paint. Again, he has the lucky advantage of very switchable teammates with length and athleticism.  You dont really seem to get that Danny Green cant guard Harden and if Thybulle is on the floor their offense is gonna be bad. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry will also have to play big minutes. Its not gonna be like you are thinking at all. Embid is gonna have to sometimes. Also you keep ignoring that they are going to get burned in Drop coverage heavy.  &gt;'m more and more getting the impression that you don't watch the Sixers. Harris isn't DPOY caliber in his minutes like Simmons, Thybulle, and Embiid when he tries, but Harris is an excellent and versatile defender. If you'd watched Sixers basketball, what you're describing is not how they've defended the pick and roll at all. You're generalizing with a vague idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the roster. Also, you seem to be basing this idea that Claxton will get playoff minutes on nothing. The starting lineup contains DAJ and will for the playoffs, they've already said that. That doesn't exclude the possibility of him playing light minutes to start with Claxton off the bench, but what they've been experimenting with more is KD going down to the 4 and Blake at the 5. All bad defensive setups. Claxton is only slightly better on offense or defense, and the politics are keeping his minutes to a minimum. If LMA were still playing Claxton would never take off his warmups anymore.  Harris has never been known as a good defender in his career ever. He will get roasted by any of the big three...like any of them, same with Seth Curry. I'm basing this on the reality of what they are. Okay so you know nothing about the Nets basically and are talking about things you dont know.  They have not said that. They have been trying to move away from Jordan for awhile. Claxton has been called their best defender by Nash. He's much better on defense than Griffin, you do not know what you are talking about.   They are benching DJ right now for Griffin too and as Claxton ramps up he will get more minutes. They wanted to bench DJ when Aldridge was there too. Which is why Claxton got minutes the very first day Aldridge got there and DJ got a DNP.  Every single metric shows DeAndre as a poor player, they are not gonna play him good minutes in the playoffs. Claxton will get minutes. That is flat out false lol. Nash literally called him their best defender. DJ literally was a DNP last game. They may experiment with BG at the 5 but once Harden comes back its gonna be clear Claxton needs to be the center.  Nic Claxton has also been on Covid protocol for awhile and Nash has been ramping up his minutes as he only got back two games ago.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;No, that's not what spacing is. Spacing is the result of something, not literally someone just sniping. And any decent NBA defender can recover to a stationary turret to contest a shot. If there is no off ball movement, the spacing suffers. You're pointing to one playoff victory over Gobert when he was younger as proof of your erroneous point, but you're really just highlighting the exception to the rule. Not only that, but Harden's efficiency really suffered that series and the Rockets won because they were clearly a far superior overall team. Good luck replicating that on current Rudy or Embiid, especially with no off ball movement and a far worse defense than in Houston.  Spacing is the result of having good shooters on the floor you cant leave, you arent getting it. The Rockets had no off ball movement at all. All Harden/KD/Kyrie has to do is get by his initial defender and the others already have an advantage. Houston had stationary shooters for years and their offense was great, LOL now those stationary shooters are KD/Kyrie/Shamet/Harris, you do not know what you are talking about.  You are reaching hard.  Younger Gobert? Lol it was 2-3 years ago when Gobert was still a defensive force in the league and it happend 2 years in a row. Embid is not a better defender than Gobert. Harden destroyed them the first two-three games in both series. It took them 2 games to adjust. By then Cp3 could kill them when they ran drop coverage lol, what do you think Kyrie and KD are going to do Embid. And the only reason Harden did poorly in those last couple of games was because they were sitting on his left forcing him right, something that DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE. They built their whole offense around stopping Harden, good luck doing that with KD and Kyrie on the team.  The thing is....Philly is actually only marginally better on offense than those Utah teams as well. To boost their offense you would need to play Curry and he's gonna get reamed on defense.   &gt;It's not a lazy take. The Warriors moved heaven and Earth to fit KD into their offense. We fundamentally changed our offense to work him into it. Steph had just led the league in scoring while shooting 50/45/90 and he took 2 fewer shots per game. We also made all of our triangle sets feature KD in scoring position, which gave Steph a lower quality shot selection and lowered his efficiency. This obviously isn't a bad idea, the man is the best pure scorer in the NBA. But Steph/Klay/Dray all had to be selfless in order to integrate Kevin Durant. And Kevin Durant is a hyperefficient scorer whose only goal was to win. Granted he phoned it in the next two years and refused to run our offense, but our stars sacrificed for him. Kyrie and Harden simply are not as selfless as Steph and Klay. Harden and KD both think they are ""the guy"" and there is eventually going to be friction. Just like there was with Shaq and Kobe. Just like there was initially with LBJ and DWade. Steph was our guy and stepped back for KD, and he didn't care who ""the guy"" was. The difference to your current setup is there is a third star with a history of problems in this exact area and locker room drama and this ""big 3"" has only played 2 games together.   &gt;   &gt;You are grasping at straws and I think you are really emotionally invested in Harden getting a championship here. I'm not rooting against them, I personally visually love Kyrie's game and KD is fascinating to watch, and Harden is who the other team has to game plan around. But I just do not see this as a good fit. I see the same perfect storm around each team like last year's Clips who get hype because of the talent before people take the rose colored goggles off and notice their flaws.  Mhmm..narrative nonsense.   You are grasping at straws. You have an idealistic view that off ball-movement based offense is best and only the players who fit that mold will win.   Harden and KD is one of the best fits in the league and Harden and Kyrie literally went like 16-3 together."
"What makes you think that the Jazz will even make it to the finals? Also no, Rudy Gobert isn't even close to being a top 10 center of all time is he wins Finals MVP."
"Went from potentially Rudy Gobert with a jumper to Serge with a jumper. If he doesn't turn the corner soon he's gonna be Channing Frye that can occasionally block shots. Last few games, although meaningless games, he's had very good box score numbers."
"So is Gobert though. By many metrics Gobert is having one of, if not the best defensive season in NBA history while leading his team to the best record in the league.  If All-NBA weren’t position locked I’d say all three have been top 5 players (when healthy) but Embiid has missed 19 games while Rudy has missed 1."
"This was the case in the playoffs last year as well. If someone just looked at the numbers they'd think Jokić BBQ-ed Rudy by putting up 26PPG on 510/480 splits, but if you actually watched the games and followed the Nuggets prior to that, you could easily tell that Rudy took him out of his comfort zone better than anyone ever did (at least individually).  Limited him to the perimeter hard most of the time, it's just that Jokić was like ""Eh, guess I'll be peak Dirk this time around"". It didn't help that it was ""shit on Gobert"" season, so people were rubbing that in extra hard."

"&gt;  He's gonna have to. There is a reason Gobert has never done well against the Rockets lmao. Its because his drop coverage gets him played off the floor. Kyrie, James and KD will kill him that way, be it easy mid rangers or pull up threes. Harden will get possessions with him on the perimeter. They simply do not have enough to slow them down.  The Jazz defense is great and they have a better team defensive system, but typically when Rudy Gobert leaves the key, bad things happen.  If you've watched the Sixers this year, Embiid doesn't leave the paint.

Danny Green also cannot guard Harden one on one either. He will absolutely be pulling that extra defender be it iso or pick and roll, never mind that in your scenario Kyrie or KD(two of the best iso players in the game) are still getting one on one coverage at the end of the day lol.  I'm more and more getting the impression that you don't watch the Sixers.

We had decent spacing in Houston, not great. Turrets? We had average to below average shooters who took a lot of 3s. That was pre floater Harden and Harden being the only all star on his team. Damn...its a shame Harden has never beaten a team with a great rim protector....Gobert lol. Kyrie and KD dont have to run around any screens, we didnt do that in Houston. Harden can get them open looks by them standing still. But just to be clear, KD and Kyrie to get around screens that;s a lie. Harris will be playing plenty of minutes.  No, that's not what spacing is.  Spacing is the result of something, not literally someone just sniping.  And any decent NBA defender can recover to a stationary turret to contest a shot.

Hopefully this Jazz superteam with GOAT level players like Rudy Gobert and Jordan Clarkson will let the Lakers at least win one game.

No one ever says it like that  Its just that some ppl rsspect players like rudy gobert more since he gets dunked on a bazillion times (and as a result gets clowned on bare on social media) but still the reigning DPOY because he dosnt make business decisions
"amen to that my brother. The brother is a monster in the paint. Rudy ""3x DPOY"" Gobert after this season, mark my words."
"&gt; Rudy Gobert is going to win DPOY though, that's facts.   now that is true facts"
"Nice man. Rudy Gobert is going to win DPOY though, that's facts. The brother is special. Ben Simmons is a bonafide scrub compared to him. Ben Simmons man, he can’t play! No disrespect whatsoever, but I’m sorry to call, tell everybody the truth, the man cannot play the game of basketball. He has small hands, he can’t catch the ball, he has bad feet, he can’t really move even though he’s mobile, doesn’t really know what he’s doing, doesn’t have a post move that he or he puts to memory that he can do two times in a row. He has no game whatsoever, plays no defense, doesn’t have the heart, the passion or anything that comes with it"
"But no one says dumb shit like ""Rudy Gobert can guard all 5 positions"" so no duh?"
Easy yall. Gobert with a consistent shot.   ^or ^even ^better...  &gt;**Rudy for three.**
"&gt; Nah this sub  calls Gobert DPOY all the time.  It's all about the context of the clip. Look at the MPJ dunk thread, lots of people clowning on Gobert and making Simmons jokes. This thread a lot of Rudy DPOY comments. People will comment on things they like."
"Rudy Gobert ""denotes"" over Jokic"
gobert played kinda bad but in any given possession hes still rudy fucking gobert lmao
"Jokic dropped 24/9/13 on 9-11 shooting while getting constantly fouled by Gobert, but yeah Rudy can guard Joker"
Rudy Gobert
Simmons is better on offense than Gobert is anyway.  And they are averaging the exact same points per game at 14.4 so if he's trying to roast Ben he's roasting Rudy too
"&gt;Big men are not getting the same quality shots if the three point line doesn't exist.    That's true, but I'm referring to the shots they got without the arc.  Nowadays, bigs routinely shoot way over 50%.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four *all-time* in effective FG%.  11 of the 20 all-time are currently active bigs.  &gt;You can watch tape of games before the line was introduced  Believe it or not, some of us played basketball before the arc.  We don't need to watch tape.  &gt; and see how cramped the paint was  And bigs still shot better than Curry does, most years.  The median seasonal effective FG% is .478, and most bigs are north of the median most of the time, almost by definition."
Rudy Gobert?
"I’ve been saying for a decade that Drummond is overrated. His box scores are insane but part of that is:  -He gets a lot of touches and shot attempts, so he averages a decent amount of points even if it’s not efficient. He’s shooting like 50% despite only living in the paint and taking a ton of easy layups and dunks. Rudy Gobert for example shoots like 60%.   -He misses a lot of layups and gets his own rebounds which inflates his rebound count. Especially his offensive rebounding count cannot be taken at face value   -He doesn’t really rim protect despite having the body type to excel at it  He doesn’t move off the ball and just stands on the baseline and clogs the paint    Drummond is a fine player but the fact he was getting a max is laughable. He’s a good starter at best. It’s no wonder he was traded then bought out like a hot potato"
"&gt;It's not even about Zion, nobody is getting called at the rim anymore  That's questionable.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four *all-time* in effective FG%, in NBA history.  11 of the top 20 all-time are currently-active bigs.  Those guys are not shooting threes, and they are converting their shots at unprecedented rates -- because interior defense is virtually non-existent in today's NBA."
in that contingency then rudy gobert wins   look it up
top 2 covid NBA moment after rudy gobert touching all those microphones and then testing positive later that day
Kenny brought up Donovan Mitchell as an MVP candidate during this conversation.  It infuriates me for some reason that these guy dont understand Rudy Gobert is far and away the most impactful player on the Utah Jazz.  I can understand Shaq's dumbass not knowing about it but Kenny has been brought up as a potential front office or head coach candidate.
"Utah. I like their play style, their coked-up 80s-era Wall Street coach, Rudy Gobert, and the reaction we'd see from the talking heads who've been talking about them being a paper tiger all year (""hurr durr they'll never beat LeBron!"")"
Rudy Gobert has played the same amount and has a better record than CP3. He's the current MVP favorite and the media seem to agree...
A team led by Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell is not making the finals
Rudy Gobert second team All-NBA 👀  Bam third team??
"I know you did, and the cup slap was his first tech. Look at the [play-by-play summary at 9:13 in the 1st Quarter.](https://www.espn.com/nba/playbyplay/_/gameId/401071048)  I responded to your initial comment because of this line:  &gt; Remember when Rudy Gobert got ejected like 15 seconds into the game after his post game presser criticizing officiating? These guys definitely planned that shit lol.  That insinuates to me that the refs came into the game with an agenda to get Rudy tossed ASAP, which I don't believe. If you wrote something like ""Remember when Rudy got those two quick fouls, and one literally at tip off, after his post game presser criticizing officiating? These guys definitely planned that shit lol"" then I would most likely agree with you. I'm just saying, I think he got tossed by the actions that got him the two technicals, which were warranted. I don't think him being thrown out was as much about him being a direct target because we would see that same first tech and second tech with anyone who slapped a water cup and kept arguing with the refs."
"&gt;The right guy with the right skill set could abuse these mini centers  It doesn't even require much of a skill set.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four *all-time* in NBA effective FG%.  12 of the top 20 all-time are currently active.  Interior defense in the NBA has disappeared almost entirely."
"Same vindictive attitude, same power-tripping, same lack of accountability, same culture of refs having each others' backs. Remember when Rudy Gobert got ejected like 15 seconds into the game after his post game presser criticizing officiating? These guys definitely planned that shit lol. I wouldn't go as far as to say that there are still refs betting on games, but there are definitely players they like and dislike, and the ones that complain (rightfully) are consistently officiated worse than other stars."
Rudy Gobert agrees
he only had one game in the last 5 where he shot under 40%? and that was also against the Jazz with Rudy Gobert.
I am quite possibly the thirstiest Gobert fan on this sub and I would have trouble even saying he should be All-NBA 1st team as a center. He's somewhere in the 3-7 range and while I think Embiid's missed games should put Rudy ahead of him Jokic is a better player than both this year.
Then why is Rudy Gobert considered the best defender in the league?

“oh no my paint” - Rudy “Eric Rosen” Gobert
"The races in 2018 and 2019 were (or at least should be) closer than this year.  Embiid probably would have won in 2018 if Gobert had missed a few more games.  Giannis had a case in 2019 leading the Bucks to the best record in the league.  If Rudy hadn’t already won two DPOYs he would be running away with this award this year no question, but it seems like some around the league want to give it to someone else simply to give it to someone else.  Sixers fans were up in arms about the award in 2018 Because Gobert played 8 fewer games than Embiid yet not a peep this season that Simmons has missed 11 more games than Gobert."
using stats is a dogshit metric and rudy gobert is just a role player - r/nba
"Yes, however have you considered that I hate Rudy Gobert"
If you watched Rudy Gobert without access to basketball reference’s advanced stats you’d think he was a solid but unremarkable center
You can raise the point without shitting on Gobert. Those snubs you’ve listed doesn’t mean Rudy is any less deserving.

"Maybe like a jazz light. Great all around team, but we don’t have the same caliber players. Capela is kind of Gobert lite too except he runs the floor better. Except that it’s the same skillset Where Rudy is better in most"
You think he had a better season then those players I named? Him winning MVP would be like if Rudy Gobert won MVP
"Rudy Gobert only averages 2.77 blocks per game which really underrates the defensive impact he has when it comes to effecting shots.      Joe Ingles only averages 4.6 assists per game, despite being one of the best pick and roll ball handlers in the league and playmakers in general. I think in 2018-19 he led all non point guards in assists while starting every game as a small forward."
"What’s even stranger is how strong of a case Rudy Gobert would have based on this logic and he’s top 5 in all the advanced stats, and they have the best record in the league  but people crucify you for bringing it up."
Rudy Gobert missed 26 games the first year he won DPOY so anything is possible.
"Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving vs Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley.  Brooklyn in 4."
"Rudy Gobert is not some offensive beast that Brooklyn should be afraid of. Most of Brooklyn’s points come from the outside. Nets in 4, 5 if Jazz shooters catch fire."
"Here's some remarks on probably the most unremarkable game of the NBA season (or NBA history, you decide). But hey, I wrote all this shit down so I figured I'd share:  * Early on when Rudy is in the action on D he's comfortable straying away from Poeltl to contest shots. First possession he alters an elbow jumper from Vassell then next possession he leaves Jake Puddle to contest Keldon Johnson's layup. This Spurs bunch doesn't have great passing so they're not looking for JP on lobs or quick interior passes to punish Gobert * CAVEAT TO THE ABOVE POINT: two straight possessions the Jazz guard the Murray/JP PnR with two guys; Gobert stunts to Murray both times and Murray finds JP for two buckets * Trent Forrest Good: puts Vassell in jail on the PnR and hits a nice floater. Trent Forrest Bad: leaves his feet contesting a pretty weak Murray pump fake (on replay Murray may have even been looking to pass?) and fouls the shit out of him. Trent Forrest Good: slips by Murray in screen-the-screener action that Quin loves and gets a wide open dunk (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""That's a big time NBA move."" Uhh, no Craig, the Spurs fucked up the coverage and were all yelling at each other after the play) * Wooofff Rudy Gay just got flat-footed by Bojan on an iso and beat to the rim. Bojan isn't De'Aaron Fox, folks. Maybe it's legs because the Spurs have had a hellacious schedule but that looked pretty bad * Spurs get a couple buckets in the first with Lonnie Walker going at Clarkson. The Jazz need JC in the playoffs but he's going to get attacked, he's dying on every screen (even small/small screens). At least JC is hitting the floater though, 5/6 early for 12 1st quarter points * Dieng is getting cooked in PnR. Like Jordan Clarkson [cooking a grilled cheese cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nreFpbJXt30). He gives up a wide open lane to Ingles off a Gobert screen then on a Forrest/Gobert PnR he doubles Forrest (???) and it's an easy lob to Gobert. He's -14 in 6 minutes. Jazz up 22. Cue Drew Eubanks * Oni kinda looks like a guy who can be a good on-ball defender but he's not particularly quick or long or strong or cerebral. Granted he's usually guarding some of the bigger threats. And on offense he'll hit the open corner three and get some offensive rebounds but that's basically it. If he doesn't add something to his game this summer I don't see him sticking. He's like Royce but slightly worse at everything * Pop may be throwing in the towel a bit early tonight? Poeltl hasn't been in since his first stint, logging just seven first half minutes. After going down 22 they're running with Walker/Eubanks/Tre Jones/Bates-Diop/Samanic to close the 2nd quarter. That is, uhh, not an inspiring group. But I don't blame him, the Spurs have been ahead of the game with resting players and I'm sure Pop is trying to save his guys for winnable games and the play-in * Let's talk about Joe Ingles. He's running the point when he's out there w/ Conley/Mitchell out. Everyone says he's ""crafty"" which is kinda just a bullshit lazy white-guy characterization. To me crafty means you have multiple moves, countermoves, variations on those countermoves. LaMelo Ball is crafty, Ja Morant is crafty, Luka Doncic is crafty. Joe has exactly two moves in the PnR: (1) drive left, pass fake and shoot (2) drive left and dump off pass to Gobert/Favors. He's just **really** good at those two moves. Which is hilarious because, as someone who watches the Jazz all the time, you see it coming from a mile away. But Joe times that pass or pass fake so perfectly that it works more often than not * Jazz up 24 at the half. Bojan leading the way with 19 points on 8/9 from the field and getting to the rim at ease against this not-your-father's-Spurs Defense * Addendum to Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: (3) a third defender comes over in the PnR to tag Gobert and Joe whips a lefty pass to the corner for a Bojan three * Watching Royce O'Neale is kinda hilarious because he makes like four buckets a game but he celebrates each one like a cocky eighth grader. He finishes on Poeltl with an admittedly nice lefty scoop shot and looks at his hand as he runs back, then makes a WIDE open three and points to the corner camera while backpedaling. But hey, if you play a thankless role guarding the best guys and being the fifth option on Offensive like O'Neale, go ahead and celebrate big guy * Self-Aggrandizing-Victory-Lap on Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: Joe does move (1) and gets an and-1 on Poeltl (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""CRAFTY!"") * All of the sudden the Jazz are up 36 midway through the third quarter and this game is over. Friendly reminder that there are too many games in the NBA season and to get your COVID Vaccine. Yours truly will now be tuning out and YouTubing Jordan Clarkson cooking grilled cheese"
Daniel gafford is basically Rudy gobert on Lu dort money
Rudy Gobert is up there
"If you played basketball, you'd understand why offense will always outweigh defense. It is much harder to consistently and efficiently score than it is to consistently defend...it is harder to consistently create plays for yourself and others, than it is to defend...not only that, perimeter defending is significantly more difficult and requires more focus than interior defense. Gobert is primarily standing still and staying with 15 feet of the hoop at all times, that does not require that much effort relative to a primary offensive player or an elite perimeter defender.  &gt;Rudy running around setting the most screens in the league is a bigger physical burden than KAT/Jokic taking jumpshots  C'mon man, every big man is out there setting tons of screens...Embiid, Jokic and KAT are constantly battling and banging around in the post, I don't think Gobert really is out there posting up all that often from what I've seen.  &gt;Your argument doesn’t make any sense. A team with Rudy as its best offensive player is probably not very good. A team with Towns as its best defensive player is gonna be worse.  In a vacuum, you can compensate for individual weak or average defenders through team defense...harder to be a good offensive team without 1 or 2 strong scoring options. If you substitute Gobert for KAT on the Timberwolves, they get worse...on the flip side, because the Jazz are so deep and talented across the board, if you flip KAT for Gobert on the Jazz, I think they get worse because they don't need him to score.   &gt;You’re just taking a very narrow minded approach to what makes a player good. Defense is more important than offense for centers.  No, I'm taking the mindset of someone who played and knows basketball...I do agree defense is more important for bigs than perimeter players, but I wouldn't say its more important than offense overall in a vacuum. Tell that to the Nuggets and Sixers who completely rely on the offensive games of their centers to be top teams in the league...if you swapped Gobert for those players, the Nuggets and Sixers would probably both drop out of the playoffs, at best be low seeds.  Gobert is a great player, but he is asked to do less and is only capable of doing less...he is a specialist, not an all around player."
"The last time we saw Team USA the Celtics let down America, and Myles Turner pissed off Rudy Gobert as long as none of them are in it I’m cool   Yes I’m petty idc how good Tatum, brown and smart are"
"“Dylan Carter covered in-depth just how underrated Jakob actually is on both ends. Carter also tweeted some staggering stats, chief among them is how Jakob’s defensive field goal percentage was tied with Rudy Gobert at the time at a blistering 42.8 percent (now 42.2).”  https://airalamo.com/2021/04/23/jakob-poeltl-underrated-where-ranks-among-nba-centers/  “With Poeltl off the court this season, San Antonio has a defensive rating of 113.5, which ranks 22nd in the league. When he plays, that number drops all the way down to 106.7, a figure that would be the best in the NBA. More importantly, Cleaning the Glass omits “garbage time” from these stats, so Poeltl isn’t just helping the Spurs put up empty numbers when games have already been decided.  Of course, it’s worth mentioning that these are team stats rather than individual ones, but Poeltl still ranks in the 89th percentile among all players when it comes to on/off defensive rating. His impact is evident in other metrics too, such as FiveThirtyEight’s overall defensive RAPTOR and ESPN’s Defensive Regularized Plus-Minus (DRPM), where he ranks 1st and 8th, respectively.”  https://www.poundingtherock.com/2021/3/26/22349444/jakob-poeltl-san-antonio-overall-impact   What I said is not controversial. It’s an opinion that I have that is based on games I watch and articles I read."
He'd be like a Giannis with Rudy Gobert on steroids rim protection
"He’d be a smaller, quicker Rudy Gobert/Bam hybrid with better playmaking"
"Huh? I only mentioned Gobert in passing so I pretty much did make a case for A without mentioning B. Rudy is a great help defender, weakside shot blocker and rebounder. As a man defender, the talented big men put up numbers against him consistently. Simmons toughest match ups are much smaller and quicker/shiftier guards which makes sense due to him being 6'10"". The fact that he is asked/expected to cover those dudes on a fairly regular basis actually makes a case for his defensive prowess even greater."
okay? he still isnt on gobert’s level as an impactful defender. sorry  the sixers have three defenders better than the jazz’ second best defender yet the jazz are marginally behind them in defensive rating. why? rudy gobert
"The game before the shut down we played the Pistons, and he went against Christian Wood. [Wood reportedly played with flu symptoms](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/03/16/report-since-diagnosed-with-coronavirus-christian-wood-played-76ers-with-flu-like-symptoms/) the very same day Gobert tested positive. It's possible he got it from Wood. It's also possible Gobert got it from Donovan Mitchell, as a week before the shutdown the Jazz played the Knicks and Donovan who is from Westchester County NY and spent time with friends and family. Westchester County was one of the first COVID hotspots.  I'm not trying to play ""find patient zero"" but just feel bad for how much hate Rudy got for being the first one tested. I get he brought some of the hate on himself, but dude will forever be known as the guy who gave the NBA Covid."
"Nah apparently a back up big man will shore up a bottom 5 defense...   It would take Rudy gobert to cover this teams defensive problems, not washed up Blake griffin and Clax"
"Here are 2 places where your argument breaks down imo:  1: You claim opposing guards are trying to get Gobert to switch on them on the perimeter to exploit his weakness as a perimeter defender.   This is wrong. Teams primarily work to get Rudy defending 1-on-1 on the perimeter to get him out of the paint.  They are trying to take away his dominant presence near the rim to create easier opportunities for teammates to score there, NOT because he can't effectively defend the perimeter 1-on-1.   2: The double-standard of criticizing Bigs for weaker perimeter defense against elite scoring 1's &amp; 2's, while not criticizing guards for being weaker post defenders or rim protectors against 4's &amp; 5's.  For example, Rudy gets downgraded by you here cuz you say elite guards try &amp; get him in perimeter Iso situations. Yet when, say, Jokic or KAT try and get a switch to post up Simmons instead of Embiid--or more generally--any scoring big attacks a size mismatch against a guard in the post, the smaller players are NEVER criticized as ""weaker defenders"" because they can't defend a situation as effectively due to an overwhelming situational physical advantage."
"Devil's advocate refers to arguing a contentious position to test the strength of an opposing argument. So if I were to say ""Rudy Gobert is the clear DPOY"" a Devil's Advocate would be responsible for poking holes in the argument. The easy and obvious way to do that would be to make a case for Ben Simmons as DPOY and force me to defend why I think Rudy is a more valuable defensive player than Simmons is. What you are doing is not devil's advocacy, it's just saying shit and hoping no one looks too closely.  DPOY and defensive ability have never and will never be about who is the most versatile defender, it's about the best and/or most impactful defender. The defensive player who adds the most defensive value to their team, not the one who meets an arbitrary requirement you've invented. Even if your standard was universal then Simmons would still be miles ahead of Bam and Embiid who don't have his ability to lock down guards. They're competent at handling switches but they're far from incredible at them.  Which, by the way, the three guys you named as being the ones you want to lead a top defense? Only one of them ever has, and his glory days are well past. Embiid has led a defense that was below 10th more often than he's led one that's above it and his team's two best defensive seasons both involved him missing 20-25% of the season, on top of the fact that he has two teammates in contention for All-Defense first team. Bam has been a starter on two good but not great defenses and hasn't shown anything close to consistent incredible defensive ability.  Rudy, on the other hand, has been the only elite defensive player on teams that have been top 3 in 4 of the last 5 seasons. He is clearly the best in the NBA right now at leading an elite defense and the only one who really belongs in the conversation with him is Draymond.  If you personally think that the only skill that really matters on defense is switchability then you are welcome to think that. It's idiotic, but no one can really stop you. Don't pretend like you're open to reasonable debate though, saying that the sky is magenta isn't playing devil's advocate, it's being deliberately dense."
"I'm chuckling imagining an adult person spending their precious free time logging onto the same website every day and every day discussing the same important subjects like ""Is Russell Westbrook overrated or underrated?"", ""Is Rudy Gobert top 15, top 25 or top 35?"" and ""If Miami won in 2011 but with Chandler injured and Dirk averaging 8/8/8, what would that mean to Kyle Kover's legacy?"", with the same, barely ever basketball-related arguments every day. Yeah that doesn't sound pretty. Oh wait that's me."
"I'll happily take the clowning and getting called a nephew, I just wanted to have a discussion about it.  I don't view Rudy as a bad defender overall. I think he's the best rim protector in the league, which is super important for so many reasons. I don't view him as the best defender in the NBA. I said I was playing Devil's advocate after all. Going along with that I also don't even view Ben as the best overall defender in the NBA because he's not a great rim protector.   I think players like Draymond, Embiid and Adebayo (Also AD) are so much better than the rest of the field in terms of defensive impact/versatility that anyone else being mentioned for DPOY other than those 3 is, IMO, stupid. Those players are not an easy bucket at any spot on the floor, and each of them deserve a 1st team all defense nod.  Ben is insane at guarding 1-4, Gobert is insane in terms of his rim protection. I think both of them are the best at what they do. Ben needs to get better at protecting the rim and Gobert needs to not get targeted in the PnR/Switches before I consider either of them the best defender in the NBA. But that's the narrative right now.  If I need the best perimeter defender in the NBA right now it's Ben, if I need the best rim protector, it's Rudy.  If I need a versatile 4/5 who can guard multiple positions, not get abused in mismatches and lead a top defense it's one of Dray/Embiid/Bam. AD should also be in that conversation dude is fucking nuts on defense when he's locked in.  If that makes me a nephew then I guess I'm a nephew."
"I bought your argument as valid until you didn't have Rudy in your top 5. Ben over Gobert for DPOY is a valid take that I respectfully disagree with. Gobert outside the top 3 defenders is nephew shit and totally invalidates the arguments you'd make for DPOY.  The only possible argument for your list is that you consider defensive skill to be synonymous with ""switchability"", which is absurd but at least consistent."
"&gt;Jazz  I know I'm a homer, but who on the Jazz team is unlikeable? Don gotta be one of the more likeable guys in the league... Add Jingling Joe, the Minivan, Rudy 'The Weeb who loves ducks"" Gobert, Bucket's O'neal, and Oscar winner and 2 time Teammate of the Year ""Mountain"" Mike Conley, and you have a likability stew."
"I'll play Devil's Advocate here, although I have a bias as a Sixers fan.  I've seen teams this year, and in the playoffs last year, look for a switch on the perimeter to get Gobert.  I've seen teams this year look to get a switch so they can get anybody else besides Ben.    Ben willingly takes the assignment of someone like Dame, Luka, etc, the opposing team's best perimeter player is usually Ben's assignment especially in crunch time. Those same players who try and get Ben as far away from them as possible simultaneously hunt for Gobert on the switch in crunch time. The Sixers and Blazers played earlier this year and I remember even though Dame was going off early in the game the moment Ben took the assignment he was slowed down and the other players had to make shots in order to win, Dame couldn't get the good quality shots he was getting vs Danny Green/Seth Curry anymore. IMO as a team defender, Rudy is easily top 3 and to many top 1, In terms of overall defensive skill I don't have him in my top 5.  My 5 in no particular order are:  Draymond  Ben  Embiid  Adebayo  Smart  Honorable mention Thybulle but again I'm super fucking biased."
"&gt; But I find it very hard to believe the argument he's more impactful on defense than Rudy Gobert.  why?  Philly is statistically a better defense than utah and simmons is their best defender  That's basically the entire argument for why gobert deserves DPOY, he's the best defender on one of the top defenses  If anything I think this is positional bias, you think a center has a higher defensive impact than a guard.  That's fair but simmons has proven he is an elite defender at 1-5, I'm not sure rudy is going to defend anyone on the perimeter effectively or chase PGs around screens while ben can absolutely do a respectable job at rim protection in addition to everywhere else on the floor"
"Exactly. Give him All-Defense, that's a good honor. But I find it very hard to believe the argument he's more impactful on defense than Rudy Gobert."
Gobert is 3rd on the Jazz  Shake Milton is 1st on the Sixers  Defensive bum Rudy Gay in 6th in the league 😂
It kinda makes me think that this will be Rudy’s last DPOY. It seems like the vast majority of media members are desperate to give it to somebody else (they seem particularly obsessed with non-centers for DPOY) but the numbers are so absurdly in favor of Rudy this year they don’t have much choice. If say next year metrics are really close between Gobert and Davis then Davis would probably win in a landslide.
Utah Drating with Gobert on- 104.3  Philly Drating with Simmons on- 107.2  I don’t think anybody in their right mind would argue Gobert has better defensive teammates. In which case there’s literally just no debate. Not voting Rudy for DPOY this year would be like not voting Shaq MVP in 2000. Every single metric is screaming Rudy.
Defence is over rated on here. No one here even knows what to look for.   Everyone shits on a a 7fters ability to defend a shifty point guard like its a problem they cant. Rudy Gobert cant defend Ja at all. Like JA just feasts on him all game. Is Rudy bad?   Jokic is a bad rim protector. He can defend other bigs at okay level.

"And this is why some people shouldn't be trusted with a stat sheet.  Gobert takes 8.2 shots a game. 77% of 8.2 is 6.3. Ayton takes 10 shots per game. 53% of 10 is 5.3. So their difference in shots from less than 3feet is approximately 1 per game. The ft difference is 5.3 for Gobert to 2.5 for Ayton. Ayton is also not a great ft shooter either, if he shot Gobert's volume on fta the difference would be about 1 point every two games.  Ayton is a significantly more aggressive player than Gobert, taking a similar volume of shots in the paint and gets to the line less than half as often. I chose Ayton as an example because I like him but it gets worse.  Capella takes 70% of his shots within 3 feet, he also takes 11 shots a game so he takes more shots in that area than Rudy does. He averages 3.6fts per game, still markedly less than Rudy. Jarrett Allen takes fewer shots total than Capella takes in that zone and still gets to the line 30% more.  JV takes a similar volume of shots in that zone and gets to the line less than anyone but Ayton.  This isn't some ridiculous conspiracy theory, its just a thing that happens."
There’s a video posted above your post (like 9 posts) called Rudy Gobert The Anti-Stat. Watch it. Debunks this idea pretty well.
Rudy Gobert really wants to block Ja Morant
Exactly. Rudy will have 5 blocks on 6 dunk attempts but the one that works is going straight to the front page and the top comment will be about Gobert being a fraud DPOY.
"I live Rudy and I'm Glad he closed the last 4 minutes well but his fist 7 minutes of the fourth quarter were bad... He had 2 turnovers,one being a really clumbsy travel and he was getting push around in the defensive end. I think there were 2 possessions were the Grizzles got 3 orbs. Gobert was not boxing out or attacking those boards like he should.   Still my DPOY please don't hate but review that entire 4th quarter."
I feel like I live in a world where I can name 20 players I'd rather have on my team than Rudy Gobert.
Just gonna leave this here  Rudy Gobert The Anti-Stat - 3 Plays He Impacted On Each End Without Getting A Single Stat https://youtu.be/d603A905dUA
I’m not saying Rudy Gobert isn’t an awesome player I’m just saying that the argument that he’s awesome just because he’s better than current Porzingis is a bad argument. There are many bigs better than Porzingis.
Rudy Gobert changes games
"Rudy ""3xDPOY"" Gobert"
Beautiful game from Gobert after the passing of Mark Eaton (with Rudy being like a spiritual successor to the Jazz franchise of what Eaton was for the team)
if you’re torn about rooting for rudy gobert or not then idk what to tell you
"I def don't like Rudy Gobert so I really wanted Memphis to win... Brooks totally choked in the last 3 minutes.  &amp;#x200B;  Brooks missed three open 3 point shots, instead of driving after 2 misses he hit a third brick. On defense he gave 3 free throws to Mitchell even though he was badly beaten... totally lost his head. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PLAY HERO BALL."
"Anyone who thinks Rudy Gobert is a shitty big man, or is over hyped, please direct your attention to Porzingis game 3"
This is what happens when Rudy Gobert is your best player.
are we gonna talk about how rudy gobert has been getting bitched all night
Imagine thinking you were tall and big enough or had the defensive capabilities to stop a downhill Grayson Allen. SMH Rudy Gobert
#RUDY GOBERT THOUGHT HE COULD STOP A DRIVING GRAYSON ALLEN LMFAO
"Steph, Draymond, and Rudy Gobert thought they had a chance. *Anime villain smile.*"
Rudy Gobert has more dunks in a game than dunks total in the entire history of the WNBA.
How the fuck did Rudy Gobert win a DOPY dude acts like a baby giraffe falling over when he faces a strong breeze.   You don't need to answer I already know.
I genuinely dislike Rudy gobert with every fiber of my being
fuck rudy gobert!!
Yeah that's why you don't help and you switch.  Outside of Mitchell they don't have great iso scorers.  If you lose because Rudy Gobert is posting up a smaller guard every possession than so be it.
I hope Ja does the Kevin Love dunk over Rudy Gobert tonight and finishes it to completion
I’m drunk dammit fuck Rudy gobert
Yeah it’s cool that he can just defer the shot creation on offense and essentially become a rich mans Rudy Gobert for a whole game like he did for game 3
Carried doesn't have to automatically mean scoring.  Example: I would say Rudy Gobert carried Utah this regular season.
I don’t know why but I read this that Rudy Gobert just died
"Feel like people only look at whether the player is worth X amount. Small market teams/undesirable locations have to overpay guys. Everyone got on the Jazz for giving Rudy Gobert $205 million, but what other player would they have got with that money? No chance a big FA goes to play over there, and they can't exactly tank with Mitchell on the team.   The Knicks haven't hit on any big FAs, so the argument can be made that they've been/currently still are an undesirable location. Maybe that's changed since they've got their shit together, but they've only had their shit together for one season, so I'm not sure top tier guys are going to head there just yet."
"Not gonna argue much in the Westbrook point, but you just mention Gobert paired with guards. Does anyone else on this list get a boost for being paired with certain teammates? No. It’s okay to admit that you might have put Gobert a little high or about 2 tiers to high. Sabonis is below several players who didn’t make an all star team this year, and is the best player in his team an one of the best bigs in the game. He isn’t a black hole on D like KP or Marc Gasol, he’s decent even better that Jokic on D. Even still his Offense, shooting passing and rebounding must be accounted for. Also Rudy deserves credit as a good rebounder. Sabonis and Joker are Elite rebounders, Joker is elite at scoring and passing while Sabonis is great. Rudy is a decent to OK."
"That's most of the centers.  What's Rudy Gobert's offensive game?  Players like Jokic, Embiid, Sabonis, KAT, etc. are still nowhere close to the norm.  And for a traditional big, Capela is good.  Outplayed both KAT and Gobert in the playoffs a few years back.  &amp;#x200B;  A hell of a lot better to have a hard nosed, defensive big that will crash the glass, hustle up and down the court and play within his game on offense by setting screens, rolling, and dunking, than another Drummond/Howard nightmare where an big lacking in skill demands inefficient post ups."
It was kinda like the current Jazz team where it was solid but no huge stars but with even less exciting players than Rudy Gobert if you can believe it.  And the Jazz also have Mitchell   I don’t think anyone really believed in those Bud teams like we believe in this young core and their ability to make noise.
Celtics would be a favorite if they added Rudy Gobert and could stay healthy
"Do these idiots realize there best players are light skinned Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, and Clarkson 🤦🤦🤦"
"the dpoys are all already engraved with Rudy Gobert or Vote R. Fatigue  for the next 3-4 years  theres no one in the same zip code as gobert defensively in the NBA right now, certainly not isaac"
Rudy gobert tends to make us look like children.
"I don't know about teams, but the *player* with the most dunks is Rudy Gobert, and we also have Slam Dunk contest winner Donovan Mitchell on our team, so you should watch the Jazz."
"The Grizz-Clips series used to have some decent trash talk, especially during the playoffs. The whole FedEx Forum busting into a five-minute “WHOOP THAT CLIP!” was a religious experience, and then the arena-wide chants of “HE’S A FLOPPER! \*clap clap clapclapclap\*” were great too. Interested to see what we come up with tomorrow against Rudy Gobert and a team with a notoriously racist fanbase"
"If anyone tries this to win a series, the Sixers are gonna roast em.  They are just gonna post Simmons in the middle and let the shooters bomb. No help for the big, we saw how Rudy Gobert handled Ben 1v1 down the middle."

"Schroeder is really good at beating drops tho. His 14-foot pull-ups are butter.  Also with Gobert on the court we can afford to play Marc and try to stretch him to the 3pt line. I don't know who's guarding AD if Rudy is checking Marc 20 ft from the basket.  Also also, the Lakers can switch everything, and did at times last playoff. If there's anything Vogel's proven is that he can adapt the gameplan defensively after a loss."
"I agree and they're pretty much going to be playing the schedule of the 2 seed after they get done with Phoenix so unless the Clippers get out of this funk or Donovan Mitchell and Rudy gobert are still really really really really pissed about being picked last in the All-Star Game, the Lakers will indeed be back in the finals"
"Yeah, I guess I just got caught up in the fan hype &amp; celebrity that is Rudy Gobert.  Classic ""poser"" move by me."
I forget how many points per possession was a Jamal/jokic pick and roll worth with Rudy in the action? It’s on NBA.com but I forget.  Gobert definitely more important than Mitchell putting up 30 a game. Really locked down the Nuggets offence and controlled the paint.
"Johnnie Bryant from the New York Knicks  It might be a coincidence that Randle put up an all nba year and RJ jumped in year 2 but it may also have something to do with Bryant; his history speaks for itself. The following players have had their best professional seasons when Johnnie Bryant was on the coaching staff. Gordon Hayward, Rodney Hood, George Hill, Rudy Gobert, Bojan Bogdanovic, Donovan Mitchell(before this year), Julius Randle, RJ Barrett. At some point I think the league takes notice and someone lets him run an entire team."
u fucking w/ me? rudy gobert? yesterdays game thread?
"Rudy Gobert started out trying to post people up all the time with basically no success, spent some time in the G league and then since 16-17 became the most efficient offensive player ever (he has the highest career true shooting ever even with those rough first couple seasons)."
"He literally gave Donovan Mitchell covid and started the jazz outbreak which shut down the season, so yes I do believe his stupidity was the reason the league shit down when it did. I also am right when I say that most people still believe he's the reason the league shut down too   https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/29/rudy-gobert-coronavirus-nba-return/  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/03/11/coronavirus-nba-shuts-down-after-rudy-gobert-tests-positive/5028026002/"
Jeezuz christ man what's wrong with these people? I feel like during this time a ban is probably not enough as a sanction for that act. Dude's trynna shut the whole league down again Rudy Gobert style.
"Rudy is a world class rim protector, not a world class floater protector. If you think this is a weird quirk of reffing on Morant, look at JV’s stats. He’s also reverted to shots outside of 3 ft compared to what he prefers to do.  Most players don’t have an amazing floater to use as backup when they can’t get to the rim. Ja - and Chris Paul, and Harden, and Lebron, and most of the guys that do well against Utah - does. The fact they’re effective doesn’t mean Rudy’s not one of the best rim protectors of all time.  Because - spoiler alert - [he is.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/) I might just end up bookmarking that link.  &gt; How the hell is that proof that the Jazz can negate Ja by just going under screens?  Because the scheme as it stands leaves Ja alone from between the screen and Rudy at the rim, letting him go downhill and have a completely open floater. By going under screens, Ja is challenged in that floater range, forcing him to try something else. He still might adjust - maybe he does go off from deep, or maybe Memphis tries double screens so Ja still gets an open runway until the rim - but it’s something different from what he’s seen thus far, and it does ask him to adjust on the fly."
"Kanter talked shit on his way out. That's why. He was loved when he was here, but when it was obvious Gobert was the future &amp; Utah traded Kanter away, he handled it like a little bitch &amp; took cheap shots at us.  Idk why?  He made way more money than he would have if Utah kept him &amp; sat him behind the obviously superior Rudy Gobert. But that's beside the point.   Point is, Jazz fans are intense &amp; very passionate about anyone  who ever makes the roster.   They'll love you no matter what for as long as u live, IF you rep for them, &amp; leave with class (see: Millsap, Alec Burks, Favors, Crowder, Neto, Matthews, Korver, AK47), but if you lie, cheat,  swindle or disrespect on your way out,  you'll never be forgiven (see: Hayward, Kanter, Trey Lyles, Mark Jackson, Derek Fisher, Raja Bell, Boozer)"
"&gt;Ok, now do his other 16 FTAs last night.  lol you're the one trying to make the case that Ja is getting to the rim just as much as he usually does. Thus far, I see no evidence showing this to be the case. Your turn to actually find statistical evidence to prove your point.  &gt;My point is that Ja has been getting wherever the fuck he wants with ease  My gosh, the circles we're going in. *He's not putting the ball in the hoop at the rim at the rate he did in the regular season.* If he has FTAs that aren't reflected in FGAs, that necessarily means the shot he took while getting fouled did not convert, so it was successfully defended. If you want to say the refs last night were overly touchy and that on normal occasions many of the Jazz ""fouls"" on Morant would not have been fouls, then all that does is pull down Ja's effectiveness at the rim, because, again, those ""fouls"" did not result in made buckets. And again: you're not accounting for the fact that the stats I've pulled include game 1, where Rudy was in foul trouble most of the night and wasn't on the floor for long portions of the game he normally is.   Ja is scoring a ton of points thanks to his 3-10 foot floater, which is the area of the court the Jazz schematically allow to opponents. Going under screens would limit the effectiveness of this shot. These are both facts. Ja still might adjust his game to account for this adjustment and still score a lot of points, but he won't score as many from 3-10 feet, which has been his bread and butter thus far.  &gt;he's been able to score at a high level even against a ""super elite rim protector"".  The next piece of evidence you find that shows Morant has been effective against Gobert - not Utah's defense as a whole, and not in areas of the court where Gobert usually operates, but Gobert himself, while he's on the floor - will be the first such piece of evidence."
"Russ is one of my favorite guards all time. Consistently a top 10-15 player in the league throughout his career. This season though, putting him right at 25 is generous. Here’s the 24 players I have before him, and I can’t see there being an argument he outplayed any of them this year:  Joker embiid curry Durant  harden Giannis Chris Paul Devin Booker Ja morant  Kyrie Irving  Dame Ben Simmons  Rudy gobert Donovan Mitchell  Trey Young  Luka Kawhi  LeBron Anthony Davis Jayson Tatum Sabonis  Bradley Beal PG-13 Khris Middleton   That would put him at 25. I think a case could be made that Jimmy Butler or Bam would be more deserving of this spot. Also you’d have to put Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray higher if they weren’t injured."
"Rudy Gobert is the truth, glad his defense is even more on point than usual, and the Jazz are a fire offensive team and he gets to show that part of his game off. Jazz look very good and I look forward to their (hopefully) 2nd round series..  Luka still dicking down the clips and now he gets a home playoff game... I may eat these words later but FUCK THE CLIPPERS"
"I mean, you can get an extremely lite version of Gobert, but you're not going to plug in another rim protector and have nearly the same level of shot deterrence/disruption that you get from Gobert.   The Jazz had a top-5 defense this season while ranking last in Turnovers forced. That's *ridiculous,* and it illustrates how special the impact Rudy has is.  Saying Gobert's skillset is replaceable because players like Poeltl and Embiid exist is exactly like saying Simmons' skillset is replacable because other switchable players like Andrew Wiggins and Lu Dort exist who can do a bit of everything. It's true, but it's not the same."
"I don’t want to make this a “rim protector vs perimeter defender” argument, but a “What can Rudy do defensively vs what can Ben Simmons do Defensively” argument. Even if you have Gobert as the best rim protector in the league, you can ask Jakob Poeltl, Myles Turner, Joel Embiid, and some other rim protecting bigs to do what Gobert does and they would be able to do a good enough job doing it (not on the level that Gobert can). My point is that centers that protect the paint, play in drop coverage and contest shots at the rim are more common than guys that can guard all 5 positions like Ben Simmons can. There isn’t anything that guys like him and Draymond can’t do defensively and that defensive profile is extremely rare"
"Here's the way I look at it.  Rim protection is more important than perimeter defense.  It's arguable whether Ben Simmons is the best perimeter defender in the league. Jrue/Bridges/Butler all have reasonable claims.  There's no argument that Rudy Gobert isn't the best rim protector in the league.  Given that, it seems pretty clear that Gobert's defense is more valuable and harder to replace."
"It's Gobert for me, he is simply the better defender.  And while Ben Simmons has the versatility factor, he spent less time on centers than Rudy Gobert did on guards."
"Yeah, this definitely feels like an incomplete picture.  From that short chart, Ja didn't miss a shot in the restricted area; his one blocked dunk started _far_ from the basket. And props to Gobert for that one.  I doubt Gobert is defending him further from the hoop, so are all these misses from game 1?  And with Ja putting up these numbers, I don't really care about stats with Gobert as the primary defender. If he's not able to prevent Ja from scoring at the rim, he's not protecting the rim. Maybe that's a scheme issue more than a player issue, but holistically the Jazz (with Rudy on the court for 37 minutes) are not protecting the rim from Ja."
Rudy Gobert. refer to the clippers who have great perimeter defenders but no anchor in the post which has been killing them
"Rudy Gobert effectively takes away the most efficient shot in the game, a layup. Teams change their whole offensive system because of Gobert."
"Nothing at all against Simmons, but a Rudy Gobert is so much more valuable IMO.  Simmons can shut down a player, but Gobert can shut down the entire post.  It's much easier to work around a guy like Simmons whereas you can't avoid Gobert unless you just want to jack up long shots all game long."
If you think that then you have the analytical abilities of a two year old. It’s almost a a certainty that Christian Wood gave Rudy Covid but even disregarding that it was coming to the league no matter what. If Gobert doesn’t get it then the league was shutting down a couple weeks later at absolute best. Every nba player pushes and flops. You have to be really naïve to think Gobert does that more than others.

Gobert probably won’t guard Porzingis. He’ll likely play free safety off Finney-Smith. The bigger problem for Dallas is Porzingis has never been able to guard Rudy on the roll. Gobert could legit average 22-25 ppg against the mavs if he plays enough minutes.
TELL THAT MFER ABOUT ME!  \- Rudy Gobert
"r/nba hates him, but Rudy Gobert dominated this game on both ends."
Rudy Gobert....?
Yeah but also Rudy Gobert is supposed to be a very good rim protector.
No i'll just blame the one player doing it named Rudy Gobert.
I can't stand gobert. Nothing against rudy as a person but i hate french people in general
Did you happen to watch Rudy Gobert this game at all?
"Nah Jonas hit Rudy in the face, it's really obvious after actually watching this video.  Gobert definitely exaggerated the contact, but it was there."
Rudy Gobert is a great player.  I bet Satan would be a great player too.

Does Rudy Gobert actually have fans. Like do people outside of Utah support him?
"Jazz getting gifted this game, holy fuck. And I don't like either team. Also fuck the Rudy Gobert"
the first time i ever heard of rudy gobert was that whole touching microphones thing when the pandemic first started. so that's the only thing i associate him with. not his skills or anything. just that lol
"Rudy got grazed on the cheek, he was steady on his feet and JV was coming straight down from a layup.  And that principle applies to force that displace people from their base of support, not when hit vertically lol   Gobert just flopped plain and simple"

Fuck rudy gobert!
There can’t be actual humans who like Rudy Gobert
Is there anyone more detestable than Rudy Gobert
That’s superstar Rudy Gobert apparently.
Imagine buying a Rudy Gobert jersey. Jazz fans would rather buy a Big Dawg jersey.
Every day I think about how if I were simply 7’2 and long I would be just as good at basketball as Rudy Gobert

Rudy Gobert. Played off the court in the playoffs everyone.
RUDY FRICCIN GOBERT
Daily reminder that Rudy Gobert is a fraud
It’s impossible to spell Rudy Gobert without “yogurt”   Do what you please with this information
Yeah it's Rudy that's the problem. Rudy no TalkBack gobert
Gobert playing when Zubac is in works. Synder has bring in Donovan and Rudy when he's playing. But he also needs to consider benching Favors for good. Dont think he's been positive even in the wins
It’s mind blowing that they blame Mitchell for giving Gobert the ball early when Rudy has zero offensive game
"hey is that Jazz fan who made that long winded ""Rudy Gobert should be MVP"" post in here?"
"Can't wait for him to have a good half and a bunch of commenters pop back in with the ""Why isn't Rudy Gobert top 10? I mean if you really think about the impact he has and basketball is a 2 way game..."" Enough with the dramatic ass reactionary takes"
Rudy Gobert is the Joel Embiid of the West. Except at least he won’t go 0-12
Rudy Gobert is the Ben Simmons of big men
Sure experts can see that Rudy Gobert is fucking trash but &gt;!can they see why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch!&lt;
"Let’s be honest, no team led by Rudy Gobert is going to contend for the title..."
Prime Dwight Howard &gt;&gt;&gt; Rudy Gobert
That moment when Patrick Beverley is running around doing nothing but has more stats than DPOY Rudy Gobert
hey guys i just wanted to let everyone know from the bottom of my heart fuck rudy gobert
are the clippers aware you are actually not allowed to go up this big on greatest known defensive presence in the universe rudy gobert????? like isn't he the anti-alien defense system like he would block it lol he's incredible and probably mvp of the last 5-6 years according to DFRAPTORLEBRONOISTAN
That Rudy Gobert contract though
Rudy Gobert having a very limited offensive game is really going to hinder this Jazz team going forward.
Rudy Gobert getting sent to the Bejing Ducks by Nicolas Batum
His best connection was Rubio. Ingles usually does better with Favors. Conley with Gobert. Conley and Mitchell still working on when to pass to Rudy and Rudy is still learning how to catch it sometimes.
Rudy Gobert man.... how can you die on that hill.
If I’m Rudy gobert I’m demanding a trade at halftime
Rudy gobert with 1 point and 3 rebounds is suboptimal

"The league is well on its way to having a new least favorite Francophone center.  Mighty huge achievement for Embiid, for people to start disliking him more than Rudy Gobert."
Bill Simmons doesn't think Rudy Gobert should make the HOF...
"He hasn't been playing well offensively at all, either.  A lot of our chances are dependent on how well Ingles can get Gobert going.  He was starting to feel it a little bit last game. That high pick and roll action is where the advantage is with the Clippers going small, but they've done a really good job forcing the ball out of Ingles hand and not letting him get in space with Gobert rim running.  It would help if Favors and Niang would remember they're good at basketball, too.  We really could use some size and physicality outside of Rudy.   Morris is tough but he's not superman, you can push him around and at least challenge them a little more for playing small."
"Aged like milk my dear casual nephew   2020-21 NBA All-Defensive teams:  First team: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday  Second team: Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard"
"So my dear Casual nephew, as I told  Here the results   2020-21 NBA All-Defensive teams:  First team: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday  Second team: Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard  https://mobile.twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1404574866418900999"
"Dylan  Dylan  Dylan  Dylan  And Dylan.    Also,   Matisse Thybulle  Ben Simmons  Draymond Green  OG Anuonoby  I can’t decide between Rudy Gobert or Joel for my 5th, so I’ll go Joel Gobert."
"Top 10 defensive win shares for 2020-21  Spencer Dinwiddie  Henry Ellenson  Mike Conley  Rudy Gobert  LeBron James  Julius Randle  Elijah Bryant  Dante Exum  Ben Simmons  RJ Barrett  This is your voting list for all-defensive teams, correct?"
To even mention Tybulle in the same sentence as three time DPOY Rudy Gobert shows the extent of the Kool aid drinking.
U almost get it it’s funny he’s Amazing at defense literally better then dudes that play all game he does it in 20 mins probably the most efficient defensive player in the league not named Rudy gobert
1st G - Stephen Curry G - Damian Lillard  F - Luka Doncic F - Giannis  C - Nikola Jokic  2nd G - Chris Paul G - Jimmy Butler F - Kawhi Leonard  F - Julius Randle C - Joel Embiid  3rd G - Kyrie Irving G - Paul George  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Lebron James C - Rudy Gobert
"Yeah, and he still isn’t as good. Rudy Gobert is a much better defensive player than Lillard and Lillard is still much better."
"He was constantly put in PNR situations which are his biggest weakness, there is no center in this league who can box out Ayton, pop out to cover Paul, then get back on defense and be in position to contest shots at the rim.  What are we discussing here?? He's a terrible rim protector, literally everyone knows that.  He's a solid neutral defender when the guards in front of him don't allow penetration every play.  Did we watch the same series? Chris Paul was like 90% from midrange because him and Booker would continuously get to the paint, pulling Jokić out.  It tired him out and forced him to address his biggest weakness.  Did you see how many weak side offensive rebounds the Suns got whenever Jokić would attempt to stay the shot? MPJ/Gordon had terrible rotations.  Dude got 20 boards, including 10 offensive against fucking Ayton  ""He's trash""  Literally nobody is arguing Jokić is a good defender.  But we are not grading all players in a vacuum.  In today's game, he's perfectly capable as a team defender, literally any stat will show that. Please look them up. He's a far cry from terrible, he just has a glaring weakness which every player has, his happens to just be perfectly exploitable by the ultra athletic, sharp shooting Suns.  Of course his offense will always be the reason he's in the league, nobody is taking Jokić to anchor their defense; if that's your measure of importance in the Center position, enjoy Rudy Gobert and... who else, exactly?"
"In Goberts defense the Clippers practically did everything they could to not involve Gobert on the defensive end. Idk [if you saw this from Ben Dowsett](https://twitter.com/ben_dowsett/status/1404479323436843009?s=21) but Rudy averages 28.5 ball screens defended a game(so essentially being put in the pick-n-roll). Vs Memphis he averaged 37.8 a game. Vs the Clippers he’s averaged 19. So essentially the Clippers are running all their pick-n-rolls away from Gobert, usually keeping the guy Rudy is guarding in the corner so he’s not getting involved. Rudy gets frustrated when he isn’t getting involved and I think it definitely showed on Saturday."
Rudy Gobert gonna freeze lane to deny exp
"I think Zion over Rudy is obscene too. Don’t get me wrong, Zion is a force of nature, an All-NBA candidate after 83 games played- but he isn’t there yet. His defense is still pretty bad, which is his biggest flaw, and he’s working on refining his playmaking and outside shooting. Is he still a great player even if he doesn’t improve those things? Sure, but not better than Gobert. Rudy is a gameplan altering menace who’s won three DPOYs (arguably should have four)- he makes players shoot an average of 17% worse from the floor, per what Doris said during game two. He’s improved his turnover/brick for hands problems, and he’s not as unswitchable as he’s made out to be.  I also think Rudy is better than Tatum/Book/Trae, all of whom are streaky (and Trae’s a bad defender.) You made the case for him over Mitchell. And I love CP3, but I think he doesn’t consistently turn it on enough to be over Rudy- he shows he can do it, like last night, but he’ll often have 9/4/6 games and let other guys take over. But all of those guys have better cases than Zion IMO, at least from what we’ve seen. So, TL;DR  I’d put Rudy in the 10-15 range."
"I agree lol I've been saying from the beginning that despite Mitchells crazy he's still part of the system built around Gobert on both ends. No knock on Spida but Rudy might be the most impactful guy discounting obvious franchise superstars  Rudy's rim protection but also his screening, efficiency, and rebounding on offense is the biggest reason of why the Jazz are so good"
"2016-2017 Jazz go from good 5 seed to Elite Team  Pg - George Hill, Raul Neto, Exum, Shelvin Mack  SG - Joe Johnson, Alec Burks, Rodney Hood  SF - Gordon Hayward, Joe Ingles  PF - Derrick Favors, Trey Lyles  C - Rudy Gobert, Boris Diaw  &amp;#x200B;  You'd have an elite scoring option in Joe Johnson, DPOY Gobert, Hayward before injury, Leader in 3Pt% Joe Ingles, and an elite slasher in George Hill. Plus, Burks/Hood/Ingles/Diaw becomes one of the best bench units in the NBA."
"When it comes to a guy who’s role it is is score, and he’s not a good playmaker or excellent defender.. yes. I’m talkin bout Tobias Harris, not Rudy Gobert"
"Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley you mean"
"I got Sixers vs Jazz. They played twice in the regular season, where Ben Simmons put up 42 points in 38 minutes but lost because Embiid was out. The last time they played both teams were fully healthy and Donavan Mitchell put up 33 points in 42 minutes meanwhile Rudy Gobert put up 12 points in 38 minutes while allowing Embiid to put up 40 points in 40 minutes. The Sixers pulled out a win with both teams fully healthy. In a 7 game series in the finals I got Philly winning it in 6."
"I think a Sixers / Jazz finals would be the best fun for nearly everyone from a fan's standpoint.  ROY runner up Donovan Mitchell can do his best to try and score on DPOY runner up ROY winner Ben Simmons, while also DPOY Rudy Gobert can get his shot to slow down MVP runner up Joel Embiid.     Plenty of fun storylines all around."
"not really, jokic and embiid had mvp level seasons , curry carried a good deal harder, giannis fit many typical mvp criteria, and if you want votes for a more “impact beyond the stats on a great team” player, you’ve got rudy gobert who was on the best regular season and is more clearly his team’s best player"
"Bruh did you see their defence in the playoffs? Nurkic couldn't stay on the floor because h couldn't defend without fouling.      There's no doubt that with Gobert this Blazers team would be conference finals calibre, Portland had the second highest ORTG in NBA history this past season and Rudy would solve all their defensive flaws."
There's a massive difference between an Impactful defender for 10 mill. And Rudy Gobert.
laughs in Rudy Gobert
"&gt;On offense the system is low key reliant on Gobert being one of the best screeners in the league. People meme about his screen assists, but he's vital to getting a lot of people open looks. So I'd very much dispute that this Utah team is anywhere near as good w/ Towns instead of Rudy. Maybe if you gave the management team an offseason to make trades / adjustments.   Clearly they would play differently.  Instead of Gobert, who defenses only need to guard at the rim, opponents would need a mobile big who could chase Towns out beyond the arc.  That would provide ridiculous opportunity for Mitchell, Clarkson, and company to drive for layups -- which in turn forces help defenders to scramble and yields just as many great shots as screen-assists do, and probably far more.  Utah would be well-nigh unguardable with Towns.  Would that offset their defensive decline?  I think so, but reasonable people may disagree, and we probably won't see them traded straight up, so we'll never know.  I think it's ridiculous to suggest Utah + Towns would not be an excellent team. Best case for an opponent is beating them 150 to 140, and not many teams can shoot with Utah + Towns."
Imma say the Clippers because if you're the Suns then you know you just won on the core of an all-time great veteran and a skilled supporting cast. The Clippers are a team that give you TWO superstar veterans with an also well-rounded supporting cast.   The Jazz are terrific but their best veteran is Rudy Gobert and the team is gonna feel really good about a team like that after having just swept the MVP
"I see honestly two scenarios that play out in this years playoffs:  1. We have the Suns going all the way to face the winner of Nets/Bucks and would be a greatttt series and I can't even pick a winner out of those 3. Hope it goes 7 games. 2. They get stopped by the winner of the Clips/Jazz series and that comes out to a couple scenarios: If the Clips win and come out of the west, Kawhi will carry his team to a championship. If the Jazz come out, I do not see Rudy Gobert not getting exposed by Nets shooters or Bucks penetration or slashes.  Either way, I am just so excited for the playoffs as always and going to be sad on the off time. I hope the players recuperate and get good time healing in the off season. I guess we have the draft to look forward to this summer at least haha."
"The story of basketball can’t be told without mentioning Rudy Gobert and it’s not because of his defensive prowess or potential HOF resume.   He etched his name in not only basketball annals, but history books for his part in this pandemic."
Rudy Gobert does boxing training in the off-season (and he originally wanted to be a professional boxer) so that’d be a good place to start. Idk if any current NBA players have any MMA style experience
"&gt;  I seriously doubt Utah + Towns would be any lower than a two.  The team is literally built to optimize Gobert's strengths.  The defensive system is basically packing the perimeter and funneling everyone into Rudy.  It's what allows the Jazz to play Bojan Bogdanovic (who, recent defense on Kawhi aside, isn't exactly regarded as an elite defender) at PF without getting wrecked.    On offense the system is low key reliant on Gobert being one of the best screeners in the league.  People meme about his screen assists, but he's vital to getting a lot of people open looks. So I'd very much dispute that this Utah team is anywhere near as good w/ Towns instead of Rudy.  Maybe if you gave the management team an offseason to make trades / adjustments.    Minnesota + Gobert - KAT obviously isn't a top seed either, FWIW."
"The center position is by far the most important defensive position though, there's a reason why Rudy Gobert got a supermax and DeMarcus Cousins got a $5.3 million contract coming off of a 25/13 season."
"Gobert is much easier to build around. I’m not sure if it’s possible to build a defense good enough to win a title with KAT as your center. And if you could, it requires finding somebody like Draymond/AD/Giannis that’s a complete game changer defensively at the 4 spot. That’s a really tough ask for a GM to just find that kind of player. Gobert let’s you mostly forget about defense for all your other roster spots. Finding the players to complement Rudy (just guys that can shoot and 1-2 playmakers) is easier than finding the guys that can make up for KAT’s defense. It’s easier to find six shooters than three 3-and-D players.   The key here is KAT lowers your ceiling defensively (by a good amount) but Rudy doesn’t lower your offensive ceiling (even if he does nothing for its floor). That’s what important in building a championship roster."
the Clippers ran just *16* ball screens involving Rudy Gobert for the entire game. They ran 40 involving other players.  It's obvious they're trying to focus their offense away from him.
John Stockton  Corey Brewer  Josh Smith  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Rudy Gobert  Only one guy who shoots 3s reliably.
"on the flip side, he's on a contending team with us that doesn't \*require\* him to do a ton on offense to see meaningful minutes, in big situations, as a second year player? Even Rudy Gobert, coming off back to back DPOY seasons was getting played off the floor as recently as last year."
Hell na dwight is like Rudy gobert on drugs on defensw

"He is not a zero on offense he is a very impactful offensive player. He leads the league in pure efficiency, he's an incredible screener, and he gets lots of offensive boards and putbacks. In the playoffs in particular he is leading the league in blocks and rebounds and is shooting an absurd 73% from the field. Lets please stop with this narrative  On top of that he is the best rim protector in the league. He is really the most valuable player on the Jazz and the engine of their team on both ends  [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/26420295/rudy-gobert-season-most-underrated-offensive-weapon](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26420295/rudy-gobert-season-most-underrated-offensive-weapon)"
I’d go with 3XDPOY Rudy Gobert
Whose better Rudy Gobert is Stephan Adam’s
Whose better Rudy Gobert or Clint
Rudy Gobert has 12 points ?
lol Rudy Gobert on the perimeter is way better than your average center. Him getting crossed by superstars relly ruined people's perception of his defense
Rudy “Shamgodd” Gobert
Well I guess Rudy Gobert would be the final evolution lol
I like Rudy Gobert.
"I think the big difference is that Jokic seems to get exactly where he wants to against Rudy, it's the same shot just from a better location. He's not moving Ayton in the same way he moves Gobert, and it's strange how much getting your shot off from like 4 feet away from where you wanted to be changes it."
He shouldn’t be getting swept in any series where he is clearly the best player in that series. Get a clue man. There’s no scenario where getting swept by Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell is acceptable especially when they are missing their starting point guard.
"If it did, then Rudy Gobert has as good of a case as Jokic IMO"
That robot would definitely malfunction against Gobert. Rudy would give it a virus and it'd be game over.
"Alright I have nothing to do today so I actually just watched all 14 3PA he has had in the series (just found out it's actually not that hard to do if you go to the play-by-play on [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com) and Ctrl+F ""Morris"" because it links a video for every single play).  Of those I would characterize 7 as well contested including 1 block and 2 possible uncalled fouls, 1 that's hard to say either way, 4 that are open with poor/late closeouts, 2 that are wide open with no closeout or so far away it doesn't matter.  I posted the links below.     Ironically the one he made was one of the most contested shots.  You're definitely right that he should make more of these, but I'm not sure it should be many more.  Of his 14 attempts, at most six of them could be called open IMO, and some of the contested ones are like **really** contested, to the point I'm surprised he hasn't gotten a foul call on those yet.     \### Game 1  1. \[CONTESTED\]  [Questionable shot vs Bogdanovich](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=77&amp;GameID=0042000221&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%2025%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) 2. \[CONTESTED\]  [Late shot clock vs Royce, probably a foul but definitely contested](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=363&amp;GameID=0042000221&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) 3. \[WIDE OPEN\] [Rudy chooses not to close out to the top of the key](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=366&amp;GameID=0042000221&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%2027%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) 4. \[OPEN\] [Late closeout to the corner, this one I would think would be money because of Morris' corner percentage](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=593&amp;GameID=0042000221&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%2024%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) 5. \[OPEN\] [Rudy trips and doesn't get much of a contest to the wing](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=616&amp;GameID=0042000221&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%2025%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) 6. \[OPEN\]  [Briefly wide open but Rudy covers a lot of ground in a hurry](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=634&amp;GameID=0042000221&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%2025%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) 7. \[CONTESTED\] [Off the rebound, he actually made this one despite being not a very good look](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=636&amp;GameID=0042000221&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Morris%20Sr.%2025%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20(9%20PTS)&amp;sct=plot) 8. \[CONTESTED\] [jab step shot late in the clock vs Bogdanovich](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=647&amp;GameID=0042000221&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%2024%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) 9. \[BLOCKED\] [by Gobert to end the game](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=679&amp;GameID=0042000221&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%2024%27%203PT%20Pullup%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot)  \### Game 2  1. \[OPEN\] [late closeout to the corner by Ingles, again this one should be cash](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=44&amp;GameID=0042000222&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) 2. \[CONTESTED\] [vs bogdanovich on the wing.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=315&amp;GameID=0042000222&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%2025%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) 3. \[WIDE OPEN\] [ruining Kawhi's assist numbers](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=539&amp;GameID=0042000222&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) 4. \[CONTESTED\] [another one where he's briefly open but Gobert can contest from a zillion miles away](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=550&amp;GameID=0042000222&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%2024%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) 5. \[IDK\] [another Gobert late closeout but a little more daylight here](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=559&amp;GameID=0042000222&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Morris%20Sr.%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot)"
plus mitchell has gobert too lmfao. if rudy wasn't on this team their defense would be bottom 5. even with a serviceable defensive big like favors their defense fucking *craters*.
"You're purposely misinterpreting my sentences with dumb comments like ""according to you, Ben played a 48 minute game"" when anyone with half a brain could figure out what I was saying. You aren't here to ask legitimate questions, you're here to try and tear Rudy down to make Ben look better.  I just watched the highlights too, half the time Rudy wasn't even on the floor and most of the rest of the points were either in transition or with someone else as his primary defender. Simmons had a great game, but the narrative that he abused Gobert on defense that game is false. It doesn't matter anyways, the best defender in the NBA already got his reward."
Rudy Gobert is not only the best player on the Jazz but a top 10 player in the league.
"And Gobert deters a ridiculous amount of shots at the rim from even happening. The number of times a game a guard/wing drives, sees Rudy waiting at the rim, and auto-aborts is astonishing."
"Rudy Gobert is the reason why he’s missing wide open 3s? I mean I guess being afraid of being closed out could be an impact for his shooting, but he had similar cold stretches vs Dallas too."
I wonder if Rudy Gobert could have anything to do with this?
I'm going jazz this one. Donovan Mitchell playing like he should be the MVP. Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson both 6th men of the league. Rudy Gobert the DPOY. I don't see clips taking this one. They just don't have enough manpower to stop Mitchell and company.
"I'm giving 100% credit to Ayton here. He's made sure jokic can't bully him in the post because of how strong an nimble he is.  That said he's also letting Jokic shoot semi contested jumpers which he's just missing. I think just regression to the mean. Nurkic and gobert defended him the same way but he killed him both from mid-range and 3.  He's still the best jokic defender in the league, Rudy is second."

"Dennis Lindsey had everyone sworn to secrecy following Don's pre-draft workout with the Jazz. He realized then that Don wouldn't fall to the Jazz so they traded up to get him with the Nuggets pick, because we knew that any pick we trade for with the Nuggets turns to absolute gold, e.g. Rudy Gobert."
Donovan Mitchell  Mike Conley  Rudy Gobert Joe Ingles  That's 4  Bojan Bogdanovich is borderline.
"Gobert is in a club with Durant, Harden, and Lillard, where every once in a while I think for minute and realize ""Oh shit his first name is RUDY."""
I would go on a date with Rudy gobert
So then Rudy Gobert is graded out as a subpar defender by this stat?
"Can't stand Rudy Gobert, literally one of my least favourite players"
"Unfortunately the analysis is very flawed. You’re taking all this offensive analysis in ‘average’ situations.  The Jazz aren’t an average defence, they are a top 3 defence. People shoot something like 8% worse than average against Gobert in the paint. But if you are just putting in offensive averages you’re postulating that they should be making those extra 8% because ‘averages’.  Similarly at the other end, the Clippers chose to play small without a paint defender. That changes the likelihood of the Jazz making shots in the paint when there is no rim protection. The Jazz chance of getting fouled and collecting offensive boards goes up when you are conceding height and weight to them vs ‘the average’. And with switching, Mitchell was able to select his defender on most plays, so why would you expect him to shoot ‘just average’ against his choice of defender?  There isn’t enough data to be meaningful if you just look at say Paul George vs Rudy Gobert in that location with that spacing and shot type, or to look at Mitchell vs Beverley on any given shot, so they throw in a lot of meaningless noise (who cares how either team shot against the Rockets for example) which is irrelevant to a playoff series against specific looks and lineups."
"This is actually what they want and how you neutralize Rudy Gobert, you play small ball with five shooters because he is incapable of punishing you on offense.  Jackson-PG-Kawhi-Morris-Batum with everyone spread out is what the Clippers absolutely want to do, not only it forces Gobert into guarding a 3-PT shooter, but also gives LA absurd shooting while being solid defensively, the only reason this lineup hasn't worked so far is because Marcus Morris is shooting 7% from three and Kawhi has been way below average.  Donovan Mitchell is also averaging 41.0 ppg, which is absolutely unsustainable, but let's not even mention that."
You genuinely think someone like Rudy Gobert could stop a prime shaq if he played today?  Early 2000s shaq would dominate any era with ease
Rudy Gobert
"Could easily develop into a near Rudy Gobert level defender impact, while also having a nice hook shot and able to knock down mid range. Definitely worth a max not even close. Fact that he doesn't need the ball at all to impact the game makes him so much more valuable.   If John Collins is even close to deserving a max than Ayton not getting max would be disrespectful."
"Imagine if the Bucks actually had an offensive strategy.  Like - his stock isn’t high right now, but can you imagine how much fun Quin Snyder would make the Bucks? Take the Jazz’s 3-heavy, pass intensive system, but replace Rudy Gobert with Giannis."
"20 points is actually more than he got at that time by a fair margin (although scores around the league were a lot lower), but he an elite interior defender and shot blocker.   Not too far off from a Rudy Gobert when healthy. Ayton can absolutely be elite as he's shown these playoffs, but I've got to stick up for Bogut because it's not an easy one-sided answer"
"Collins........12.2 FGA/g.............4.2 FGA @0-3ft...........75.2% @0-3ft  Gobert.........8.2 FGA/g.............6.3 FGA @0-3ft...........79.9% @0-3ft  Ayton.........10.0 FGA/g.............5.3 FGA @0-3ft...........76.6% @0-3ft  Statistically Rudy is the most dominant around the rim of the 3, though Collins obviously has more offensive versatility and is younger with more room to grow as a player.  Ayton is also young and has room to grow.  Just pointing out that Rudy is perpetually underrated on offense.  He's not a monster offensive player but is a great asset to have on offense. Jazz just need 1 more consistent guy to help Mitchell on the perimeter.  Collins not sure he's worth the max, but they should match a max offer I think.  He's pretty close to that level and could still develop more.  Ayton is a no brainer max and I think will develop into a Dwight Howard type player and perhaps even better since he doesn't have the ego issues."
ah yes hes gonna be better than 3 time DPOY (who btw was incredible on the perimeter and post this year) Rudy Gobert  it's possible but highly unlikely
"To be honest, it’s pretty sad that anyone voted for Steph for MVP. He had an insane season, but the Warriors weren’t even a playoff team. CP3, Giannis, Donovan Mitchel/Rudy Gobert, and Dame all were more deserving of MVP votes, and I’d even argue that the injured guys who were front runners at one point or another in the Nets big three and Embiid deserved votes more too.  I’m not normally one to say team success should matter much when it comes to MVP, but it does start to matter at a certain point."
"Used to work at Staples Center and that's the first thing I realized when I stepped on the court. I thought ""holy shit, this court is the same size as the court at LA fitness, or at the park."" And then I imagined Rudy Gobert and Boban parked in the lane on a court at the park and realized how truly skilled you have to be to get a shot off in the NBA. The only difference were the weird sight lines trying to aim for the basket when there's dozens of rows of seats stretched out behind it."
"There’s so much more to Gobert defensively than just length and athleticism. Mo Bamba has almost the exact same measurables but he’s clearly not the same level of player. Being a rim protector requires a very high BBIQ, things like timing, positioning, and communication are vital. Also what makes Gobert so special is the mind games he plays with people. He’s excellent at hiding where his momentum is really going and he’s also great at goading players into taking bad shots. There’s not another player in the league that could pull off what we ask of Rudy defensively- I don’t think most people understand the burden that’s placed on Gobert’s shoulders on that end."
"Except that's 3 time DPOY Rudy Gobert lol. I know y'all love to shit on him, but Ayton will not be better than him because of his rim and perimeter protection.   He'll be better because he already has a decent offensive game, and improving his post up moves will take him to another level from where he is right now, something which Rudy has failed to build up on."
"&gt;Rudy Gobert looked lost against the Clippers like he shouldn’t be on the floor defensively. Ayton is dominating them.  Lmao. I love when two circlejerks collide like this. On one hand, you have the ""Rudy Gobert should've been benched"" take, and, on the other, you have the current ""DeAndre ayton is basically a god"" attitude that's picking up steam due to his recent play. The best part is when you realize that this comment, at its core, is arguing that a **3x DPOY** (and reigning DPOY at that) is worse defensively than a 3rd year player who hasn't even made an all nba defensive team yet. I get that the playoffs turn everyone into prisoners of the moment, so it's understandable in a way, but I still find it funny in extreme cases like this.   Also, like the other guy mentioned, this comment doesn't even take kawhi's absence into consideration"
Yes that’s the question. What if he played exclusively the Rudy Gobert role
"Not that I'm estatic he doesn't wanna play center, but what do you think is going to happen if he runs into centers like Dwight Howard and Rudy Gobert? He knows his limits, especially when it comes to how his body feels after coming back from injury."
"100% he will get the max. Bridges is going to be the tricky one. I'm sure his agent will push for the max, but I don't think the Suns can afford to pay him that and retain CP3.  Rudy Gobert got maxed by the Jazz at 5yr/200mil, there's no world where Ayton does not get maxed. He is better than Gobert."
"The point isn't that Gobert isn't a way better player, it's that taking Lopez out and plugging him in fucks with the roster construction in a way that makes it much harder for our main guy to score. Lopez being able to hit a three means we can let our PF run at the paint in a way that few other C's can really allow.  You can swap out Lopez/PJ for Forbes/Gobert but then you're making the defense actually *worse* (PJ for Forbes is about the biggest possible defensive downgrade you can make) and re-tooling the offense away from Giannis and toward Bryn Forbes and maybe Rudy Gobert."
"&gt;No, two way means he is able to be efficient both offensively and defensively. It doesnt matter how he scores.   It matters in the context of all stars. There is a reason why Rudy Gobert was always seen as a weak all star."
Lol is Rudy Gobert a max player? Of course this guy is worth it
"&gt;Don't listen to this zmajxd, he hates DA and comments on anything ayton   Or you don't want to hear the truth and would rather drink the copium? He's gonna get the max from your FO but he won't be worth it until he diversifies his offensive game.  Same reason people are slamming on Rudy Gobert and his supermax."
"Gobert is more valuable over the aggregate of a regular season, but in a playoff scenario, Ayton is better because he basically doesn't have any weaknesses, whereas Rudy is a zero on offense"
"But that concept goes past ""help FA signings"" and goes straight to ""now you're just in a dream world.""   There's no good way to go the way you want. Taking it to the logical conclusion of your claim, all you end up with is worse on either level- either you get ""free agency is over with. The reserve clause is in play, you're drafted, you stay with that team until death do you part (but the team can trade you when they want to)"", or you get ""...sorry, Utah, you drafted a team well, but it's so UNFAIR you have two stars and other teams have none. By order of the NBA, you must trade Rudy Gobert to Houston for a bag of basketballs and a second round pick seven years from now so Houston can have a star too. It's just the neighborly thing to do..."" , and both of those are bullshit.   There's a point in time where nothing short of ""the 15 best players in the league all agree to take one year contracts and play for a different team each year so every NBA team gets a title"" will help even things out, so there's a point to say ""yeah, EVERY owner has deep pockets, if you're not willing to pay more, that's on you for cheaping out."""

Rudy Gobert to the Nets
"Facts you can always tell who watched AI vs who watched AI's basketball reference page and get all their basketball takes from edgy analytics-obsessed media guys. I recognize the value of advanced stats, but I also recognize things like Rudy Gobert getting played off the floor in the playoffs while some journalists had him in the MVP discussion based on defensive metrics."
"It's ridiculous lol. There were *so* many people saying ""how was rudy a 3 time dpoy?"".... because the regular season doesn't include the playoffs? It's a seven game series and the Clippers are literally spending hours trying to figure out how to get around Gobert, combine that with hot shooting and he never stood a chance against a small ball line up. It's why more of the blame should be placed on Snyder. You either take Rudy out for a smaller defender and give up paint protection, or you leave Rudy in and allow the open 3's"
"The Proving Your Critics Correct award is much more fun:  Ben Simmons, obviously  LeBron  Randle  Doc Rivers  Rudy Gobert/The Entire Utah Jazz Organization"

"how the hell so?  rudy gobert didn't get benched.  rudy gobert also maintained his +60% FT average between the regular season and the playoffs.  gobert also doesn't have some kind of psychological hangup about shooting that caused him to pass up a dunk opportunity over a 6'1"" guard."
"If I have to see any more threads blatantly hating on Ben Simmons or Rudy Gobert, and then some dumbass goes ""ArE tHeY frEe fRoM CrIticIsM??"" one more time, I'm gonna get involved."
you literally just described Rudy Gobert as well btw
Averages rounded down for the starters:  * Ben 14pts. * Kevin Durant 26 pts. * Davis Bertans 11pts. * Porzingus 20pts. * Rudy Gobert 14 pts.  Sum = 85pts.  It's not looking positive.
he lead the league in rebounds and second in blocks and is doing what rudy gobert can't
Is capella better than Rudy gobert?
Oh the most bullshit offensive stat. You know who has the highest oRating in NBA history? Rudy Gobert.
"Anthony Davis was 222 lbs and is not listed at 254 lbs. Mobley should put on weight, but so do a decent amount of highly ranked bigs coming in. Embiid put on 30-40 lbs. JJJ put on 7-17 lbs. Rudy Gobert put on like 20 lbs."
"&gt;I'd argue the Jazz might win an extra game without Rudy  How exactly? There's no one else on the Jazz roster that does a passable job at defending one person, let alone two like Gobert gets asked to do on every play once Clarkson and Mitchell inevitably get blown by."
Knowing what we know now Rudy Gobert is trash and should be blacklisted from the French National team because the DPOY should be able to guard everyone on the court while his teammates get blown by.    Did I do it correctly.
"Cus he was, in the regular season he was their best player. That’s why the Jazz could go 13-6 in games Mitchel didn’t play, Rudy is pretty great in the regular season and his deficiencies in the playoffs are overstated. Mitchell also took it up another level in the playoffs   But yeah if we’re talking about the 2020-2021 regular season, Gobert was their best player."
"2nd round exit. They might be able to make it to ECF if they are in a situation like the Nets were in against the Bucks this year. That said, if KD is injured, this team does not average more than 80 points in game, and they would be in the running for one of the worst teams in the NBA. Even if you switched LeBron for KD, I still don't think they even make the Finals. The only person aside from Durant who can shoot at a high level on that team is Bertans and he's a role play. Porzingis is too inconsistent. Simmons shrinks in the playoffs and offers no spacing for Durant to operate at an efficient level. Rudy Gobert becomes a liability in the playoffs. Overall, Durant would have to average nearly 40 PTS to get this team anywhere good. By the end of the season, Durant would be too gassed with no help and they would flame out possibly in the 1st round even."
"Brooooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣 you're still not getting it. That's great.   &gt;If it works and it's done by a player I like then why would I care if it's soft or not?  Because the entire conversation is about if it's soft or not? Did you forget? If you don't care if it's soft or not, don't annoy me when I say it's soft. So weird   &gt;I'll save that shit for people online who say ""mamba mentality"" lol  Maybe the most obvious joke ever, seeing as that Rudy Gobert taking a dive and complaining to the refs is the absolute opposite of the ""mamba mentality."" I'm making fun of suns fans who say that shit about booker, when in reality he's taking notes from Rudy Gobert about how to bait people into pushing them so they can cry to the refs. I genuinely hope this helps you because I honestly don't understand how you got this confused"
"Rudy gobert = wants to get pushed.  Devin booker = wants to get pushed.   Two amazing basketball plays that definitely aren't soft at all. I figured you would appreciate more gutty, not soft basketball so I showed you that highlight. Hope this helps friend because I'm not sure how much easier I can make it. (By the way the beginning of this is sarcasm just so you aren't confused)"
"not denying that ayton isn’t an all star caliber player as he’s clearly more versatile and offensively gifted than former all star rudy gobert, just saying that he is very much guardable"
France and Rudy Gobert of all people sonned Team USA.
"the point is draft picks bust very often. That’s a pretty simple point. I was giving u examples of draft picks busting. The number 1 overall pick is not going to be embiids level 80 percent of the time. Is that simple enough to understand? Also yes bro mo bamba’s “ceiling” was Rudy gobert, that’s why he was taken top 10."
"Marvin bagleys ceiling is embiid, mo bam as ceiling is Rudy gobert, Ben Simmons ceiling is Lebron if he gets a jumper, so what? U take the sure thing always compared to the unknown"
"They already are in contention   They as the #1 seed who fell flat in their face because they lack someone with CJ skill set but are in contention as is.   And with him would keep or elevate their chances   You really try to focus on the exact minutae of words as opposed to the spirit of them.   CJ takes bad midrange shots. CJ doesn’t put Philly over the top.   Both supposed facts by you are categorically false. Yes the latter you can’t prove, no one can. But if you examine what the sixers need at CJs position, he is a fit. Which btw pushes them beyond contention. The purpose of team building is to develop fits.  For instance... Rudy gobert was exposed in part because his perimeter defenders are turnstiles. They don’t fit or mesh well together.  Also scheme, Rudy was going up against one of the best 3 pt shooting teams. No adjustments were made to have him guard anything but the corner man.   Joel Embiid and Ben don’t fit. Ben clogs the paint. Joel can’t effectively overcome Simmons shortcomings despite getting better at the perimeter.  Embiid can cover CJs shortcomings however. And CJs strengths play into embiids."
"who on Utah is like a solid perimiter defender outside of Royce O'Neal, and flashes of Bogdonovic? The whole like, we don't have to worry about D, Rudy will bail us out he's the DPOY is such a dumb strategy. Gobert was way less than desirable this playoffs but blaming him for the team's D is so bush league, casual as hell."
"Except he didn't do nothing, he walked across the court and got right in Boogies face and then did the ""hold me back"" after boogie had walked away and the refs didn't do anything, as detailed above. I still don't understand how boogie is soft for pushing a guy who got in his face after a loss to try and... draw a technical foul? With 0.1 on the clock?  Yeah that makes sense.  Remember when Gobert got ejected and then got in the face of Kyle Anderson?  kyle pushed him, Rudy flopped like a fish, and everyone deservedly made fun of him. How is this not the same thing and why is it badass when booker does it, that's the part I don't get."
"It's getting really hard to argue for Rudy over ayton now. Every year, gobert shows how big of a liability he can be when teams game plan for him and take advantage of his weaknesses. He has zero offensive game and it really hurts the team in the postseason. Ayton is not as good defensively (but still really good) but his ridiculous efficiency and touch around the rim I feel more than makes up for it. And he's only in his 3rd year! Sky's the limit."
"Rudy Gobert just had 74% in 11 games on 81 attempts. This is just as impressive, if not more."
Why can't Rudy Gobert abuse the Clippers' small ball lineup
"I said this a couple days ago, but it's not on Gobert, it's on the Jazz's overall piss poor perimeter defense and *over reliance* on Gobert to cover up mistakes:  &gt; The Jazz's lack of any type of perimeter defense was exposed (not Gobert like a large portion of this sub believes, and this is coming from a guy who isn't a fan of him and thought he got overpaid - tho he definitely wasn't without his problems defensively either), which led to the Jazz trying to funnel to Gobert - but this doesn't work w/o back end rotations by the Jazz and also if the guy Rudy is supposed to be guarding can shoot too. This was only further exacerbated when the Jazz went to the zone"
"The Mavs were a 1-man team. I'm not sure what the excuse for the Jazz is.  From what little I saw of that series, it looked like Rudy Gobert couldn't defend anyone, which is very ironic."
"Call me a hater, call me a casual, call me a nephew, idgaf. DeAndre Ayton is better than Rudy Gobert. He’s much better offensively and he’s already a great defensive anchor (just look at how he defended the MVP in the WCSF). Phoenix got a good one."
Clippers finding out that Deandre Ayton isn’t Rudy Gobert
Saric is punishing the clippers small ball lineup ten times more than Rudy Gobert
Ayton just showing you how offensively inept Rudy Gobert is and how soft Tingus Pingus be.

And Mo Bamba was supposed to be Rudy Gobert with a 3 point shot
LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Steph Curry  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Luka Doncic  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Pascal Siakam  Devin Booker  Donovan Mitchell  Paul George  Karl-Anthony Towns  Klay Thompson  Trae Young  Zach Lavine  Bam Adebayo  Kyle Lowry  Jamal Murray  Domantas Sabonis  Russell Westbrook  Demar DeRozan  Julius Randle  Rudy Gobert  Ja Morant  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  Chris Paul  Draymond Green  That's 37 that I would rather have on a playoff team than Ben Simmons and I could definitely add more
I was told Mo Bamba was Rudy Gobert with a jump shot. I don’t think I can ever want a big man in the draft again
lmao you guys are wildin. In this hypothetical he's basically Rudy Gobert except also capable of defending the perimeter at a an elite level. You think that's not worth the max?
"That’s not what the question asked, and by your definition Rudy Gobert is a trash defender yet you don’t have him on your list? He’s slow, can’t keep up in the PNR, and gets beat off the dribble"
"There's some variability based on what player fits best with each team, but that is more common once you're out of the top 5-10 picks where the quality of each player is less clear cut and teams can draft based on need.  For example, in 2003, there was no way the No.1 pick was going to be anyone but LeBron James as all the scouting on him was very clear that he was the most talented player in the draft by a mile. Even if Cleveland had a good small forward at the time (LBJs position, and they didn't) they would have been fools not to draft him. They call this ""best player available"" rather than ""best fit"".  This year, Cade Cunningham is unquestionably the best prospect, he's a great mix of size, ball handling and offensive ability at a position thats always in demand. He's not nearly as can't miss as LeBron, but its 99% that the team that has the first pick will take him.  After that, the next 3 prospects, Green, Mobley, Suggs are all significantly better than the people ranked at 5 that people are confident in what the rough order will be. Those 4 guys, then others.  [Here's a link to a Mock Draft just for illustration purposes.](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2021/6/17/22534812/nba-mock-draft-2021-lottery-order-first-round-cade-cunningham)  Teams do sometimes go rogue and pick players that aren't ranked that highly, but its relatively rare. The best example of a team drafting someone people didn't expect is [Anthony Bennett in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_NBA_draft), who was a massive disappointment. Its always easier to see that in retrospect though, as the 2013 draft also contained Giannis and Rudy Gobert, but no one had them going in the top 5."
"I think you're in to something here, but i also think it's a little unfair to Mitchell to compare him in the playoffs vs when he's healthy. A healthy Mitchell typically has the same defensive penetration / low pass feeds to the big man style of game that Book does, but he was really not looking great after game 2 of the Clippers series in terms of his explosiveness and burst off the dribble thanks to his ankle. It really hurt his drive and kick game - mitchell isn't a super cerebral, thinky kind of playmaker, he's more of an opportunistic drive and kick / collapse the defense and find the open man kind of playmaker.  He also has never been asked to play the role of the 1 full time - for his whole career, he's had excellent pass-first guards sharing the backcourt with him, whether or not that was Rubio or Conley so volume playmaking was never his role.  Another wrinkle is that while mitchell is pretty solid in the PnR, the passes he throws are usually the ones Gobert tends to struggle catching, bounce passes and low feeds below the waist, whereas gobert prefers super high, soft lobs that let him get into position and abuse his absurd lob catch radius, so though their PnR chemistry is really good (rudy plus any guard  usually shows up as two or three of the top 10-20 PnR combos in the nba every year in terms of efficiency), mitchell is probably the least adept PnR ball handler of the three on Utah's roster.  Defensively, it's much the same story - the jazz don't take much pride in stopping their man on the perimeter and the same is defs true of mitchell - having gobert there to clean up your mistakes has made them pretty alx, but even then the jazz' defense was worse than usual on the perimeter bc two of their defenders suffered mobility impairing injuries (the hammy and the ankle), and a third (joe) is just super slow footed on top of starting to get a little bit old. It's hard to draw conclusions about the non-scoring parts of mitchell's game after watching the playoffs because so much of his game relies on his generational athleticism, but it's definitely an area to watch next year to see how he changes or adds to his game."
"To be honest, Simmons is a 6'10 point guard who guards 6'4 guys but he can't guard big men and he can't guard elite scorers which is why Trae roasted him. It would be beneficial to him to play the 4 since he can't shoot, but at that position he can't guard big dudes which makes his value go way down.   &amp;#x200B;  Did he deserve DPOY? No. The right man won it. Rudy Gobert deserved it. Bam Adebayo was also far more deserving than Simmons."
"Gobert is perfectly capable defending the perimeter, but he can't guard the perimeter and the rim at the same time, and the rest of the Jazz couldn't stay in front of their man, so it was either Rudy leave an open corner 3 from Mann, or an open layup from whatever player on the perimeter got blown by, and 3s are lower percentage shots. If there's anything to blame Gobert for, it's not punishing the Clippers for going small on the offensive end. That's a fair criticism of his game but blaming him for the Jazz' defensive struggles is ignorant."
"Lebron was being a self centered asshole for the Decision.   Simmons has zero jump shot and has zero impact in 4th quarters in the playoffs.   So Lebron was getting hate because he as being a dick. He was still a top 3 player in the league.   Simmons is almost right there with Gobert. But I think Simmons is in a worse position. He’s got Lebron’s body, vision, handles, athleticism but zero jump shot.   Rudy is a center with no post game. Similar but just one notch quite as bad.   Sucks to suck doesn’t it?"
"/r/nba doesn't have the ounce of nuance it takes to appreciate those things  Rudy Gobert got clowned all year for ""leading the league in screen assists"", even by people like Zach Lowe"
"2011-2021   PG - Ben Simmons   SG - Tony Allen   SF - Thabo Sefolosha   PF - Kristaps Porzingis   C - Rudy Gobert    Bench - DeRozan, Dwight Howard, Joe Harris"
"Completely agree, but they looked pretty great last year and I imagine that with Murray healthy this year they would’ve at least gone 6-7 with Phoenix. My main reason that Denver has a bright future is that they’re great at drafting (see Jokic at 41, Porter at 14, Rudy Gobert at 27 even though they traded him)."
"&gt;In no order. Off the top of my head. Paul george, Kawhi, Lebron, Anthony davis, Lillard, Zion, Luka, Donovan Mitchell, CP3, Devin Booker, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Harden, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Beal, Steph Curry, Klay, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie.    &gt;The maybes... KAT, Ja Morant, Rudy Gobert, Westbrook. Probably more but i think I've made my point.  &gt; &gt;22 that are better and more then i couple that are debatable.  You are out of your mind on a lot of those.   In no particular order:   1) kyrie - this dude has done fuck all but get injured and be a cancer ever since Cleveland. This dude is whatever the opposite of a leader is. Kyrie absolutely shit the bed with a far better Celtics roster than what the hawks have.   2) Klay hasn't played in two years now. He's also not better than Trae young. Klay is a great supporting player, but he's not the type of player than can carry a team like Trae young has.   3) Westbrook? That one is absolutely laughable. While I have my disagreements with some of these players, Westbrook is clearly not as good as Trae young at this point in his career. How many times does Westbrook have to blow a close game for you to see this?  4) Ja Morant hasn't done anything to really show that he's on traes level. He's a good player. But he still can't shoot and it hinders his game.   5) There is no way in hell Rudy gobert is a better player than Trae young.   6) I wouldn't take Jimmy Butler over Trae Young. This hawks team is a worse roster than Miami had a year ago. And Jimmy Butler had a pretty forgettable year tbh. Maybe he bounces back next year.   7) CP3 is probably a wash at best. At his best he's better than Trae, but he can't carry a team like Trae can due to years of injuries and milage. Pick your poison. I'd take Paul in a single game, but Trae for an entire year  8) Tatum is debatable at best. I would say they are on the same tier. Same with Paul George."
"That’s exactly my point. When Ben Simmons is telling us that he feels disrespected when Gobert is responsible for him, then the narrative around Gobert that he’s this elite defender is bunk. Ben fucking Simmons looks at Rudy Gobert and gets confidence, we saw what he looks like without it.  Then we saw the Clippers completely change the lineup and make him ineffective. If you can be schemed out, then you are not an elite defender period."
"In no order. Off the top of my head. Paul george, Kawhi, Lebron, Anthony davis, Lillard, Zion, Luka, Donovan Mitchell, CP3, Devin Booker, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Harden, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Beal, Steph Curry, Klay, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie.   The maybes... KAT, Ja Morant, Rudy Gobert, Westbrook. Probably more but i think I've made my point.   22 that are better and more then i couple that are debatable."
Again the fact that you're ripping Gobert proves how good Bill could have been  Bill is far better than Rudy and Gobert is an all star
"LeBron, Shaq, Kobe, Duncan, Curry, etc..  These players dominated the league. Players with post-season success, and not a liability on either end of the floor.   Rudy hasn’t led his team out of the second round once, and he’s not even the best player on his own team (arguably).   Give me a break.   When Kawhi won his back-to-back DPOY no one was saying that he was dominating the league.   You’re sipping on that narrative juice fuelled by the media. There’s no universe where Gobert is dominating anything. He’s so soft.  The guy who cried when he was snubbed from the allstar game dominates the league?"
"Bill Russell would obviously be able to play today.   He obviously wouldn’t be as decorated as he is now because there’s no chance he’s winning that many championships, but I could see him potentially anchoring a dynasty (maybe).  Also, Rudy Gobert isn’t dominating anything.  No one takes the Jazz seriously. What is he dominating? The regular season?"
Ik he was literally a way better and more versatile Rudy Gobert. Both ultra impactful and incredible rim protectors but didnt score alot of points
"He's nothing like Rudy Gobert. The closest player I've seen to Bill is Draymond.  Bill was facilitating defensive big, who out hustled and out worked his opposing bigs on the regular. He was a wing and a big much like Giannis, but he lacked the scoring prowess to be exactly like him.  I am not one for arguing about ""who could play today"" because it's a bit pointless without some more factors in the hypothetical."
He is a way better Rudy Gobert who won 3 DPOY's and is one of the most impactful players in the leagye  He absolutely could play today
I cant believe people see Rudy Gobert dominating in the league today and think Bill Russell can't. Absolutely baffling to me
Don't forget about that nasty front court duo of Rudy Gobert and the microphone from last March.
Rim protectors aren’t the most important defenders. Rudy Gobert is overrated as fuck. Ben Simmons proved that in the regular season. And then Terrance Mann put the cherry on top. I refuse to hear it any other way. Basketball writers and metrics are beyond wrong. The guys in the league find it laughable that they are being told that Gobert is the best defender.
"The Ben hate isn't close to the magnitude of other recent events either.      Last year the NBA season was halted before almost any other public quarantines, and in that early hysteria everyone acted like Rudy Gobert killed the 2020 season &amp; caused the global shutdown."
"Right, but with Rudy there teams could never double him from the weak side cause Gobert would be a constant lob threat. Plus no one could score inside on the defensive end."
Same should be said about rudy gobert. He's makin even more
Gobert isn't the problem. Their perimeter defenders got lazy because Gobert is so good. Terance Mann probably doesn't jack up all those corner 3s if the actual perimeter defenders didn't rely on Rudy to constantly bail them out all season
"Devin Booker has been playing great defense.  Having CP3, Mikal &amp; Ayton has allowed Booker to put some more effort into the defensive side.  He's no Rudy Gobert out there, but he is playing high level defense in the NBA Finals.  Jrue and Middleton are shooting 11% when guarded by Booker."
"Rudy Gobert.   No offensive game, just agile enough to maximize his height advantage to be a defensive force. Gets exposed in the playoffs each year, but makes an All-NBA team."
"Nah just wait until the regular season and they have one good game. We gonna be hearing about team underrated as usual: Mike Conley, Ben Simmons, Rudy Gobert, Jrue Holiday, Patrick Beverly   r/NBA loves hyping up guys that get exposed badly during the playoffs every year because of ""potential"" or ""underrated"" or whatever."
I’d make a Rudy Gobert - Baguette Biyombo joke but it’s harder for Jrue and i’m not witty enough
"Well that does it, with this injury the suns will be promptly going home, and the hogs at milhuakey are loving it! They absolutely love it! With the loss of the ""Very great"" Torrey Craig, this is a complete wrap. Giannis ""Mickeyakumpo"" Will be taking home his ""ring"" once and for all. May he enjoy it, because it will likely be the last one! I weep, you guys, I weep!I'm thinking of Giannis finally teaming up with Donovan ""Robbed"" mitchell and I weep at how great that combination is! The trade will be as follows: Rudy ""Very valuable"" gobert and a wonderful first round pick for The Greek Freak! And we all know that Giannis will be demanding it!"
"Strong disagree on your points there.   Firstly, they weren't playing that much zone, they were getting beat of the dribble and Gobert was helping.   Secondly, zone prevents penetration but is weaker against shooting (this is why say, Dallas was so effective in keeping LeBron out of the paint in the 2011 Finals, for example).   Thirdly, if penetrations are easy, then it almost doesn't matter who you sub in for Gobert - that player is going to protect the rim at a lower level. and even if they do prevent a layup, you're still conceding that outside shot.   Lastly, [Gobert is an incredible pick and roll defender](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/), despite what that one highlight of Curry spinning him around might suggest (if he's trash for not stopping Steph, then the entire league is too).    Blaming Gobert for the Jazz's defensive breakdowns would be like blaming a missed open dunk on the passer - sure, they could've done more, but they're not really the issue."
Fair enough. Sounds like a Rudy Gobert mixed with Bam Adebayo. Probably a top 10 NBA player in terms of overall impact in today’s NBA above and beyond counting stats.   That’s a bit of a toss-up with Durant if he could be close to Bam’s lateral quickness.
Is Rudy gobert a role player? He has weak offense and is just there to play defense.     That’s true. But imagine if Duncan Robinson could catch and shoot but also guard kd/booker/Lebron
"rumor has it, Harden tried to call up Rudy Gobert Nic Batum Boris Diaw &amp; Tony Parker for help... they all said, ""*oh well bruh, you shoulda been light-skinned!*"""
"Harden tryna hit up Rudy Gobert rn like, ""you know I respect your defense"""
"&gt; If I have my hand outstretched on d, I should be entitled to that area  I keep seeing people say this and I don't think you understand why that would never work. If a defender is entitled to space with their arms (other than vertical) it completely changes basketball on a fundamental level. Have you ever played basketball against the football player type who doesn't understand basketball and plays defense with their arms? Its infuriating. If Rudy Gobert stands still with his arms out to the side, that is now almost 8 ft of space that the ball handler can't dribble. That is why a defender can't be entitled to horizontal space with their arms. Another example would be post defense. If you are bigger than the offensive player, you could just put your arms out over the offensive player's head to stop them from trying to shoot over you.  I agree that I hate watching players jump into defenders to draw the foul but I think the solution is to give refs more power to decide what a natural shooting motion is. If the ref thinks the offensive player purposefully jumped forward just to draw the foul, don't call it (or call it offensive foul). Expanding what space the defensive player is entitled to is not the way to go."
"You're not necessarily wrong, but you're also overrating the knowledge of a casual fan.   The blame falls on the media for focusing hard on a few household names, focusing harder on anointing young talent without marketing the rest of the teams that are doing well.   The Jazz and the Suns were, record wise, the best and 2nd best in the league for almost half of the season. They did not receive the level of coverage that the Lakers did last season, or the Warriors did any season. The focus for the Suns was all on Chris Paul and even less for anyone on the Jazz not named Mitchell or Gobert.   The opportunities are there for the taking. The narratives are there for writing. The problem is, either it's pride or it's incompetence, the media will not give Devin Booker his respect for proving the previous narratives wrong, and as a result, they won't market him the way they'll market other young stars (Tatum, Zion, Luka). They won't market Ayton the way they'll market a second tier star like Bam Adebayo, Rudy Gobert, even Kuzma and THT get more coverage than Ayton.  It's just extremely lazy journalism and that's why casuals end up tuning out when the actually well-constructed teams with extremely disciplined players make it past the ones who have received all the media hype."
"If someone fell for a rudy gobert pump fake from 25 feet, they should have their knees smashed with a hammer"
"Well, ROTY Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert do exist."
"After game 1 of the Utah Clippers series it was Rudy Gobert, ironically he became the worst in the league game 6"
"You give me the other top TS%, and then let's examine the context for it. I could mention that both Rudy Gobert (.736 in 376 minutes) and Seth Curry (.727 in 381 minutes) have better TS%, but that proves nothing without context.  Gobert has never shot better than expected in a season, based on shot distance and frequency. (His best season was -0.1% last year.) Meanwhile, Curry is a top-tier shooter who will never get his brother's shine because he doesn't create his own shots the way Steph does. But he still had one heck of a postseason.  The glaring point people want to skirt around is that shot creation generally facing much tougher defense than people receiving the ball while already open. It's a frickin given that people suddenly chose to ignore for the sake of defending the superficiality of present-day analytics.  Like at least give me a USG% of 20 or greater or something before I take this thing to the bank when comparing it to what CP3 and Book are doing."
I thought that was Rudy Gobert
BMI is not accurate for athletes or tall people.  It is especially terrible for tall athletes.  It says Rudy Gobert would be overweight if he gained 4 lbs!
"I mean guys who just are tall, run, and jump to contest shots/get rebounds. Call them 'limited skill' instead I guess  they're almost never worth the massive money unless they're Rudy Gobert levels of defense"
"You are totally spot-on about spacing+rulebook. But that also points to ANOTHER flaw in analytics. Reliance on eFG% and TS% is also heavily flawed. Guys like Tyson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert and now Daniel Gafford have over-inflated metric values offensively bc their shot diet is almost exclusively assisted restricted area buckets (to varying degrees, of course).  The point is that championship teams know how to win in any context, and that includes ugly. Teams and players that always try to dominate on schedule end up getting sent home come playoff time, when there are bound to be times the opponent makes the game ugly for you."
"Derrick White is at least as good as Dejounte. Our bench is above average - Rudy Gay is one of the best backup 4s in the whole league. Patty Mills was on fire the first half of the season. Trey Lyles who is an okay backup 4 lost all his minutes because our depth was good. Also Jakob Poeltl was literally one of the best rim protectors in the entire league this season based on stats, similar percentages as Rudy Gobert on less volume.  Our defense constantly looked disorganized this season, giving up a lot of easy transition buckets for no reason and our fast breaks on offense looked terrible.  There was absolutely no way we would end up with a similar record as the injured rockets, blatantly tanking thunder, injured wolves, pistons with a jobbing Griffin, injured magic, or the cavs who were basically paying 30M for nothing without significant injuries."
Rudy gobert?
"I’d say yes, but I understand if people need to see a larger sample size before saying this. The only thing Gobert is better at is rim protection, and Ayton’s pretty good at that himself. He’s a much more versatile player and has already had more good playoff games than Gobert in my opinion. I’m not sure he has a major weakness that opposing teams can game plan around and take advantage of, can’t say the same about Rudy."
"Brother, if you can explain why rudy Gobert getting cooked makes Ayton the world’s best defender in a way that makes sense then ill give it to you. No need to be this toxic"
"Lol I was doing it to see explanations and all that. This thread helped me with my opinion. If I was a GM I'd take Ayton because age, and hes up there with Gobert, but Rudy is still better. Ive got to see more from Ayton besides this playoff run. If I filter out the useless ""Yes Aytons Better"" comments, I think this thread was alright lol"
"Rudy is both underrated and overrated at the same time. He's fantastic in the pressuring the rim and getting guys open in the pick and roll. He can recover quickly to protect the rim, and he uses space well.  That being said, if I'm picking one to keep, I'd take Ayton. I loved his game coming out of college. I totally get why he was the #1 pick over Luka, even if hindsight might put Luka over him. Ayton has the right size, soft hands, good touch, and plays defense. He does everything well. It is very hard to expose him.  If I had to pick one to keep, I'd pick Ayton, but I don't think he's a better player than Gobert is right now. Gobert has never had any help defensively on the Jazz. He anchors that team. He's playing 1 on 5 defense all game. If Conley was healthy we'd have seen a Gobert-Ayton matchup in the WCF which would have been beautiful."
"I think if Ayton isn't better already (I think he is) he will be very soon. He's more mobile than Gobert and unlike Rudy he can also punish a team for going small on the other end a bit.  Also, Ayton defends Jokic better than anyone I've seen, where as Rudy is Jokic's actual child."
"&gt; Prologue,  &gt; The Off season:  Magic left the Lakers. The team was said to be dysfunctional with dramas, Jeannie Buss does not know what she is doing, Rob Pelinka does not know what he is doing.   Terrible team front office, people on the street to complain about the team at one point.  &gt; LeBron James:   Revenge season after not getting to the finals for the first time after 8 consecutive finals. The king has fallen from his throne #WashedKing.   Some people thought this was it for the LeBron. He is too old, the league has finally moved on.  &gt; Other players  Rajon Rondo: A player that now don the purple and gold jersey, he was once the starter for the Celtics that took down Lakers in 6 many years before. He is now washed and fans would rather for coach to not play him. It was only until the Playoff where he showed “Playoff Rondo”.  KCP: “Binary Mamba” for his early performances and the person in prison. People doubted him and later he become the 3rd leading scorer for the Lakers throughout the Playoffs.  And more others.  &gt; Kawhi offseason saga  After obtaining AD, the Lakers had a shot to get Kawhi Leonard after a smart cap management by supposedly someone who does not understand how cap space work, Rob Pelinka  Due to waiting for Kawhi, the Lakers missed many Free Agents that were getting signed in places.   In the end, Kawhi decided to join forces with PG and the Doc Rivers’ Clippers. Brilliant move from him that hurt the Lakers because they waited for him.  &gt; Getting the pieces  However, in that slightly dark times, some a free agent that had just won the finals was waiting for where Kawhi would sign.  That person would then drop 28 points as the leading scorer for the Lakers in the opening night.   In Kobe’s word, someone who does not choose to be a Lakers “ain’t the one”. However, unlike Kawhi, he was the one.  His name was Danny Green.  The Lakers would then add more pieces around and getting someone such as Bradley Beal and finally giving a two year 5 million contract for the later Finals Starter, Alex Caruso.  In the birthday of Kobe Bryant himself, they decided to sign a person who has had bad reputation after his first stint with the Lakers.   He had become a locker room cancer and someone that was hard to coach, a former Monster back in his Orlando days, that had become “washed”. Nobody wanted him.  It was either him or Joakim Noah.  That person was Dwight Howard, he had finally made his return years later. Being signed in the birthday of Kobe Bryant can only be written in the star.   Meanwhile, Joakim Noah would later sign with the Clippers.  &gt; First half,  The Lakers had finally started their Revenge Season  &gt; The beginning of the season  Despite a strong start, the Lakers were told that they had an easy schedule, and it was reflected through their records as they have the lowest record against other .500 team as a team above .500 beside the Denver Nuggets. They would lose the first two games against the Clippers and lose some more to “good” teams.  Despite this, the Lakers stayed consistent and kept winning when they had the lead coming to the 4th. They do not drop any games that are winnable such as those against weaker below .500 team.   This is also because of the energy that they started the season with, the team truly gel together, they had the best fun that they have ever experienced. Dwight was turning to become a game changer, Javale was the one shouting the Lake Show. They even had dinner and goes to movie together. Even took a memorable picture in the Air Plane as they continue their story.  &gt; Kobe Bean Bryant  He had finally watched Basketball once more after years away from it due to his daughter named Gianna wish to see it with him.   Anytime he is in the building, LeBron and the Lakers would put out a show. Never losing when he is in attendance. Many times him and LeBron were seen interact with each other, not as rivals but as friends.   Past 2019, LeBron was playing against 76ers in Philadelphia about to pass him in all time points scored.   LeBron had finally passed Kobe in his hometown. Kobe Bryant than posted in his social media, “to continue to move the game forward and give ways to the new generation”. In his instagram was the picture of him and LeBron shaking hands just a few weeks before.  Just 12 hours later, was the darkest time in Lakers, in NBA history. Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna Bryant, with other passenger and the pilot had passed away due to a helicopter crash.  It was a dark time.  &gt; Not trading anyone  Despite the flaws that was seen in the Lakers team, even after the trade deadline, they decided to believe in team chemistry and continue with the people they have. “FOR KOBE” is what they move forward for.   &gt; After the All Star and COVID and BLM  The Lakers finally had found their groove. Finally, they were able to beat favorite Clippers and Bucks in consecutive games.   After a strong form however, the world was not the same. After the outbreak of a new virus, and the incident of Rudy Gobert and the Jazz, the NBA stopped, the world would soon follow. Everyone went to lockdown and the world was never the same.  In covid times, the world was going mentally crazy as everyone is challenged to a new lifestyle. The mental stress that had accumulated then exploded in twitter disputes, people getting cancelled left and right, celebrities getting exposed in these tough times. Then, the BLM movement happened, LeBron was one of the most vocal voice throughout.  &gt; Second half,  &gt; Getting the final pieces and the NBA bubble  The teams were collected to live in a “bubble” as the NBA wishes to continue the season.  However, for the Lakers, Bradley Beal, one of the best defender in the team, decided to not go. The bubble is not for everyone. Luckily for the Lakers they had signed Markief Morris earlier who would later be one of the most important role player for the Lakers.  Despite winning once more against the Clippers with a great showing from LeBron, the Lakers finished the season weak and were barely able to beat Nuggets’ bench players.  But time is always moving, and the Lakers as the first seed had zero advantages of being one. The playoffs would start soon.  &gt; Finale,  &gt; The playoffs  Despite later being called a “mickey mouse ring” or with an asterisk, it was one of the best played playoffs of all time. Players were shooting lights out, multiple game 7s, historic double 3-1 comeback, the 5th seed to Finals, and so on.  For the Lakers: from KCP, Alex Caruso, Dwight, Playoff Rondo, AD and his buzzer beater, LeBron and everyone else. To reach the Finals against an old team of LeBron lead by Jimmy Butler who people doubted.  And many more storylines in the playoffs.  Such as Caruso performance, starting in Finals from a meme G-League.  KCP being solid for the Lakers.  Playoff Rondo winning another one, but this time with the purple and gold.  Dwight getting his ring finally.  “Job’s not done”  And so on.   Note: I am sure I missed many stories, but it just goes to show what a storyline the 2020 Lakers were, and how they ended perfectly at the right time."
Deandre Ayton is a better player than Rudy Gobert and deserves a max a whole lot more than Gobert.
"It’s a wild overreaction to say that Ayton is better than Gobert, and not one backed up by any numbers. Rudy looked poor at times against the clippers (though he still shot 70%), but that was also without a point guard, which makes any center’s life tough. Looking at the regular season this year (a way bigger sample size) they score at almost exactly the same rate, with Gobert at better efficiency. Rudy also does a lot more with screens than Ayton.   Defensively it’s not close at all. Gobert couldn’t have his usual impact against the clippers, but that’s due to the rest of the Jazz roster not being to guard 1v1. Ayton would’ve looked like a mess as well if he had to cover all of Mitchell/Bojan/Ingles/Clarkson’s defensive mistakes. There’s a lot of situational things that have made the eye test between the two look closer than it should.  Overall, I’d also caution against using the eye test too much with Gobert, especially if it’s just a few game sample (like 6 games against the clippers). Rudy just moves really awkwardly and looks uncoordinated a lot of the time. He also has more defensive responsibility than any other player in the league, and most of the time he gets “beat” it’s someone else’s fault. Gobert looks like a deer on stilts, but he’s ruthlessly effective even if it looks funny. Ayton moves and plays much smoother, but in terms of effectiveness it’s not really a contest."
Ben Simmons on why he's DPOY over Rudy Gobert: 'He guarded me … I had 42 and apparently I'm not a scorer'  Everything looks extra bad after this playoffs for Gobert. Lol.
"Yes. In fact, Rudy Gobert is the worst center in NBA history."
You haven’t watched good basketball then. There is no rotation.  Zero box outs. It’s like all the defense got coached in the same defense Rudy gobert showcased in the play offs
This will be the 75th nba finals without Rudy Gobert
"Did you watch him in the playoffs? You think that’s an all-nba player? I’m not saying he’s not one in the regular season, but he falls off a cliff in the post-season like clockwork. A point guard who shoots worse than Rudy Gobert is going to get exposed in a best of seven"
Mb Rudy Gobert.
"Ben Simmons has worse touch than Rudy Gobert, DeAndre Jordan and similar rim running centers.   Anyone would call you crazy if you said Gobert and DeAndre will fix their jumper and they actually shoot with the proper hand. Why would anyone think its logical that Simmons can fix his jumper when nobody expects those other rim running centers to?  He will never ever be a passable shooter. He needs to focus on becoming a center full time and hitting 65% of his free throws. Hopefully its not in Philly. Cant stand watching him."
"No Conley with semi healthy Mitchell went 2-2 with Kawhi. If Mitchell was fully healthy and they had Conley, I think it's not nearly as one-sided as many would believe.  The big issue with the Jazz wasn't being able to go toe to toe with the star power of the Clippers. The Jazz were one of the most potent offenses in the league this year, they can get their buckets, and for what it's worth, I thought Mitchell was one of the five or six best players in the ahoffs this series, and that was playing on only one ankle. Part of the problem was that they couldn't abuse size mismatches offensively. That's half because Gobert lacks the offensive skill to create in a mismatch, and half because our best PnR play maker and lob thrower was out.   The other part of the problem, which was the Jazz's lack of perimeter defense, wouldn't have been helped *much* by Conley returning, though he's definitely better than Clarkson on that end, but the extra scoring and playmaking provided by Conley could have made Utah's defensive woes less of a pressing concern.   When you consider *why* the Jazz couldn't take advantage of the small-ball lineups, Conley's absence is much more impactful for the Jazz than Kawhi's was for the Clippers, imo. If Kawhi is out, they lose an elite scorer and defender, but they have enough guys that they can cobble together enough hands to make up for his shots by committee, they have lots of long, capable wing defenders, and they didn't struggle to convert on shots because of the Jazz' piss poor perimeter defense and some hot shooting night to night, which makes Kawhi's elite offense a lot less important. For the Jazz, the only guys on the roster who are genuinely good at feeding Rudy when he's sealed off his man are Ingles and Conley (and to a lesser extent, Mitchell when he's having his best days), and Ingles can't be a full time point guard because he gets way too gassed when asked to constantly attack closeouts, and he doesn't have great stamina. He's best when he's playing off of a ball dominant guard, and being the secondary ball handling option."
"Also [Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gobert, Larry Bird and Bill Walton](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lebron-james-lefty-mixed-handed-11620954356)"
"Bruh what? He literally got his teammates sick, I don’t know where you’re coming from with this “he didn’t hurt anyone” bullshit.   Jazz fans try to excuse what he did by saying nobody in the country was taking it seriously, and that he actually served as an example and helped America see covid as a real threat. Load of shit lmao. He did this in March, well after the makeshift hospitals had gone up in China and cases were already present in the US. My place of work already had restrictions in place.  If Rudy Gobert made you take covid seriously, you were probably being an asshole or listening to trump for information about a pandemic."
"Oh it can definitely happen again. It's happened twice in the last 2 years. We blew up 3-1 lead and 2-0 leads in the playoffs two years in a row. Quin needs to seriously look himself in the mirror and decide whether that defense with relying on Rudy to cover everybody else's mistakes is good enough for the playoffs. IMO it's obviously not. It's really easy for Quin in the regular season. He invests close to no time and preparation on it, Rudy is just this good and has repeatedly shown that he can elevate a bad defensive team into one of the top teams in the league... at least in the regular season.   But in the playoffs all the weaknesses get targetted and exposed. And IMO it's fair to say that this defense is not going to cut it. There are just too many weaknesses outside of Rudy and the core of this roster is to a large degree set for the foreseable future so you will have to make schematic changes IMO. Just an example - MKE had one of the better defenses in the league in previous years(BTW similar defense to ours with dropping the big in the paint)... but that didn't cut it in the playoffs... so what did they do this year? They started switching more and mixing in other coverages and it has helped them in the playoffs. Maybe it cost them several wins in the regular season while working out the kinks, but it was probably worth it. IMO we need to do the same thing and try to practice other ways of stopping teams. We need to have options available when a team adjusts.   This is just one thing... we need better defensive perimeter talent too. Our backcourt is extremely small with both Conley and Mitchell being 6'1""... Bojan is not quick and athletic enough and Ingles has not been good defensively last 2 playoff years either. We need athleticism and defensive ability on the perimeter. Be it through the draft or through FA/trade. We definitely need help there. This is the FO's job. And now that Dennis Lindsey has paid the price for his bad decisions last two years, a new FO will have its shot at completing the roster too. Hopefully with players that Quin actually wants(there are reports that DL and Quin didn't see eye to eye on some of the most important acquisitions the last 2 years(Favors, Azebuike).   We need improvements from our players too... I don't know how much better Gobert can get... but Mitchell definitely has a step further he can take. Maybe some of our young bench guys can take a step forward(Oni, Brantley, Forest, Hughes).... but yeah...   That's the thing. This team is largely set when it comes to the core. I don't think there will be any major changes(unless Conley doesn't resign I guess.. which is possible, but even then we don't have many avenues to address that and we will have to address it internally most likely). There still are avenues for this team to get better, though... and again, lets not forget this was the best regular season team in the NBA this year. They are not starting from a low platform here. Hell, they even took 2-0 lead against a Clippers team that actually had Kawhi Leonard. They just couldn't respond when the Clippers made changes about the way they were attacking our defense. So now it's on all levels of this team to make the team better - FO, coaching staff, players... we need to get better, but it's likely this will be a good playoff team next year again... and we will see if they've made the required improvements when that time comes.   Apologies for the long post - **tl;dr - yes, this could definitely happen again, and it's the responsibility of everybody on the team from FO, to coaching staff to players to make this team better, more versatile and more resilient in playoff settings.**"
"Also wtf are you talking about? Denver’s a great drafting team. Jokic at 41, Murray at 7, MPJ at 14, Rudy gobert at 27, Donovan mitchel at 13. Those guys heathy together win the championship every single year."
"PG Clippers was running a backup center against Deandre Ayton and Rudy Gobert. If we only take out Kawhi from the Clippers and Giannis from the Bucks, I think it’s a pretty even match up with maybe Bucks taking the edge because of Jrue."
LOL @ people thinking Rudy Gobert is some sort of scrub who's not worth his pay. Mitchell has better chance to win the title with Gobert and hopefully healthy Conley than going to like 95% of the teams that can afford him.
Their window closed when they gave Rudy Gobert the max lmao. Hopefully Spida gets outta there soon.
Rudy 'Quarter Billion' Gobert
"Man, you're all sorts of wrong. Scola isn't 42, he's 41. I know that's not much of a difference but he was 39 when he ""carried"" Argentina to the finals. So it seems like two years is a huge difference in your mind. He also didn't carry the team. Deck, Campazzo and Vildoza are now in the NBA in part due to the amazing performances in the WC. That team was also comprised of well stablished players in Europe like Laprovittola (MVP of Liga Endesa in 2019), Brussino and Garino (all of whom had NBA experience as well). Since you claim to know European basketball so well I believe you should know this. Now, you gotta help me out with this, since I clearly don't know european basketball at all. Which 3 second rules are you talking about? The one by which you can't be in the paint for three seconds if you're the offensive player? Because that one's in the NBA, too. In fact, the NBA has the more restrictive rules, since you can't do that also if you're the defensive player. In FIBA, though? You can live in the paint if you're defending. Now, are you claiming that Giannis can't dominate because defensive players would just wait for him in the paint? It seems like you need to watch him play more, you seem to have the notion that he just jumps from the free throw line and stuffs it in the rim and that's how he got two MVPs. So, two times MVP Antetokoumpo can't carry Greece, but Luka Docic can carry a Slovenian team who has had absolutely no experience in Olympics nor WC. 39 yo Scola can and did, according to you, carry Argentina to a WC final. Finally, you say that all big teams were missing key players. Argentina knocked out Serbia in the quarter finals game. Their best player was Nikola Jokic. I know you claim you watch european basketball so you probably don't know who he is. He's the current MVP of the NBA. Other notable NBA players were Bogdan Bogdanovic (he played in the ECF with the Hawks), Bjelica and Boban Marjanovic. They also had Micic, which is the current MVP of the Euroleague. But you knew that already, you know a lot of european basketball.  In the Semi finals, Argentina beat France. Their best player was Rudy Gobert. As in, NBA's current DPOY. Also on that team: Fournier, De Colo, Ntilikina and Batum. So tell me again, who they were missing? Serbia didn't have 34 yo Teodosic which is a great player but far from the best. He got injured before the WC. So I guess that makes Argentina a non contender for these Olympics. The fact that you think an amazing yet young player like Doncic can carry an unproven and, to be honest, fairly mediocre, Slovenian team past Argentina tells me you know 0 about european (or latin american, for that matter) basketball."
"&gt; apparently the Rudy Gobert draft pick was bought with cash?  A late first, almost the same as an early second"
"I just looked it up, apparently the Rudy Gobert draft pick was bought with cash?"
And let’s pay Rudy Gobert $200M for sustained playoff performance… wait 🤔
"Can't wait to spend all waking hours arguing with you casuals about the value of, and false narratives around, Rudy Gobert."
"I like:  - Giannis and Thanasis Antetokounpo because they sound like Greek Gods   - Also Lonzo Ball because that's just a perfect name for an NBA player (LaMelo is such a stupid first name that it cancels out the Ball last name)   - Steph and Seth Curry also got some nice names  - Danilo Galinari and Rajon Rondo are also great, as you mentioned  - I also like Rudy Gobert when spoken in a heavy French accent  - J.R. Smith is dope too even if it's kinda basic"
They could trade Mitchell Robinson for Rudy Gobert while they're at it too

[Remember when statmuse used to tweet cool stats and now they just slander Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert like the rest of NBA Twitter? Sad. Expected more](https://twitter.com/rudygobert27/status/1409648394805547013)

Have you met my friend Rudy Gobert?
Tristan Thompson did Canada no favors by not playing. He could at least made that Balvin stiff work a bit instead of looking like Rudy Gobert in the  NBA regular season.
"Definitely a better shooter than Shaq.  I would say though that Shaq was more than just a “little” more athletic.  Shaq was probably the most athletic 7+ft big man in NBA history which is why he was so dominant.  It’s true he didn’t have the skills of modern big men but there’s (probably) still no one today that can guard a prime Shaq.    Boban probably has the skill and size to be a factor in any era.  I would just say that he doesn’t have that “alpha dog” mentality that many champions have.  Very much a gentle giant like Yao.  My opinion is that prime Shaq’s athleticism in the modern NBA would’ve been on par with prime LBJ, Giannis, and Zion and he would’ve been a perennial all star at the very least.  Like an angry Rudy Gobert on steroids.  Boban has a lot of merits that Shaq didn’t have, but so did a lot of centers that weren’t as “great” as Shaq.  Easy to forget Shaq was the consensus best player in the world for a few years in between Jordan and Kobe.  Today, Boban might be the sixth best player on his team.  Before we can compare Boban to Shaq, he needs to surpass guys like Shawn Bradley, Yao and Manute Bol."
That Rudy Gobert gets played off the floor in the playoffs.
KAT is one of the best offensive centers of all time and Ayton is only a good defensive center and a #3/#4 option.  Is Rudy Gobert better than Nikola Jokic too?
"IMHO, it really depends on the roster. The reason the Jazz were abused with small ball was because the rest of the team couldn't defend its way out of a paper bag.  &gt; I have never seen Rudy play as well as Ayton in the playoffs.  On offense, sure. On defense, it's the other way around. Gobert anchors your whole defense, Ayton is unlikely to anchor your offense.  Here's an example: The Mavs would probably rather have Gobert than Ayton. Luca could throw lobs to Gobert all game-long, and he would add much needed paint protection. If you are the Cavs, you probably want Ayton, because you already have Allen."
"It makes a huge difference. People wrongfully assume it’s due to Gobert’s limitations when if you’re watching the game and not just Twitter and Reddit highlights, it’s clearly not Gobert’s fault. Heck even if you just watch the clips you should be able to notice that.  For example, there was a post here of one Mann’s final shots in his big game. The comment section was again full of uninformed posters calling out Gobert for the open look. But what had happened was George drove and beat his man off the dribble (like he would all series) and Gobert stopped the drive.  George then kicked the ball out to Batum who was open on the elbow extended. Both O’Neale and Conley closed out Batum, who then kicked it to an open Mann in the corner.  Now people assume that’s Gobert’s man so that’s Gobert’s fault. But if Conley closes out Mann, O’Neale has Batum covered, and Bojan rotates up to cover O’Neale’s man (who was Jackson and he was already in motion to do) the Jazz are looking fine and can run any Clipper player off the line because Gobert is inside. If Gobert closes out, Mann takes one dribble, swings the ball, and then Clippers have an open lane to attack because Rudy is out on the perimeter.  See the difference?"
Calling out Rudy Gobert! Where you at? Oh yeah stuck smack dab in the fucking paint against the most efficient 3pt shooting team in the league! SMH
"I think 2014 just has Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Marcus Smart  2013 is Cody Zeller, CJ McCullom, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Rudy Gobert  Pretty much it’s only the top players in any given draft and Cody Zeller who stays with their team 7+ years"
"Again, just a complete misunderstanding and parroting the same wrong comments.  Utah’s defence works at its best when Gobert is in the paint. He is one of the best interior defenders the game has seen in 20 years. Utah’s perimeter defenders aren’t great. O’Neale is good but gives up some height. Conley isn’t the same defender he was in Memphis and usually gives up size. Ingles and Bojan are physical but a step slower than most people they guard. Mitchell (when hurt), Clarkson, and Niang are poor defenders. Utah needs Gobert inside to make up for the slow defenders and so the smaller guys can guard tightly so they don’t get shot over.   When teams play 5 out that stretches Gobert away from the paint which exposes Utah’s other defenders, not Gobert. Utah didn’t want to give up 80 points the paint so they kept Gobert at home. Gobert could have guarded Mann or Batum tightly but that would have allowed so much scoring inside if Rudy was closing out and rotating onto shooters. So they developed a scheme where when Gobert helped, he would stay at home and other players would rotate onto his man, not because Gobert couldn’t, because if he did the Clippers would have gotten a good look in the paint. It didn’t work and they should have switched it up. But switching it up by taking Rudy out would not have worked.  You can criticize Gobert for not being able to take advantage on offence. That’s fair. But defensively, it was everyone else on Utah exposed, not Gobert."
He’s cooking up some shitty Rudy Gobert joke as we speak
"That’s a huge misunderstanding though. Gobert doesn’t get exposed, the system the Jazz play does. Rudy could have easily stuck to Mann all game and held him to 5 points, but that wasn’t the game plan. And if he did, how many layups do George and Jackson get?"
Rudy Gobert wishes he could be as good as DeAndre Ayton
Ayton because he gives you more offensively and can hit mid range jumpers. He’s a little more Mobile than Gobert which is why he doesn’t get abused against small/versatile lineups like Rudy did against the Clippers or any team with stretch bigs/versatile wings. He just stands under the rim and gets weak side blocks. Once he’s 5+ feet away from the basket on defense/offense he’s useless. His feet move like they’re in quick sand.
"&gt;Ayton is playing at an All-Defense level, if not DPOY.  I think this is kind of the distinction. He's playing at a level now where if he did it for 82 games over a full season I would probably say yeah you can put him on a 2nd team All NBA defense. I think that's a big distinction though from being some generational level defender Im talking multiple time DPOY, guy who's in the top 3 DPOY ballot every yr type level.   And Im emphasizing that point because in today's NBA Amare would just murder, and if we want to argue Ayton would be more impactful to make up the gap this would be the bar like it would be an absurdly high bar on defense he would have to hit. Even like I was saying Rudy Gobert and his 3 DPOYs cant do it in the playoffs. And like I was saying I think Ayton and Gobert have defensive similarities to varying degrees.   Look Im someone who thinks Ayton has been the Suns best player in the playoffs you dont have to sell me on what he's doing. This I think is more just about Amare and how I think things have shifted to the point where the impact even a top defensive big has in the highest stages is still dependent on supporting cast."
"Dont agree with this, Clippers would have absolutely nothing for Amare Marcus Morris on Amare would be beyond laughable. If they have to play Zubac, that brings plenty of advantages for the Suns as well. Healthy Amare/healthy CP3/healthy Booker and you have a Brooklyn Nets type situation where that level of offensive firepower is just going to overwhelm every opponent which the whole point of this is to just win games not to do it in a certain way by having a certain defensive rating. Amare/2021 CP3/Booker still isnt quite Kyrie/Durant/Harden but the supporting cast is also better to bridge most of that gap.  People are also trying to make it sound like Ayton is suddenly a DPOY level player which he isnt, there are still some flaws here and there you can see on that end from him which is fine its year 3 but this is not some Tim Duncan on that end. Irony is a number of flaws Rudy Gobert has also apply to Ayton to varying degrees and if you put him in a situation like Gobert was on the Jazz with their lack of perimeter defenders the same exact thing wouldve happened to Ayton. Which isnt really a knock on Ayton it's just the reality of defensive oriented 5s in today's NBA."
"One more because now I’m down the rabbit hole lol.   Rudy gobert? He is dominant at just a few things and has a special skillset, but then a big liability in other areas.   I would think no but then with his defensive accolades I start to think why not?"
"""Rudy Gobert will start the COVID pandemic"""
Rudy Gobert if Rudy Gobert was also an All-Star on offense
"Rudy gobert is at least the best player on his team, maybe 2nd best  Where is collins among hawks starters?  Third?"
Rudy Gobert gonna get a resistant strain and then touch all the microphones
Rudy Gobert is making a Supermax.  The days of players being worth their value are over. Everybody gets overpaid.   Collins will likely get a max contract offer from somebody and Atlanta will match it.
capela anchors hawks defense much better than rudy gobert during playoffs lol
"LeBron, KD, Curry, Dwight, Carmelo Anthony, CP3, Kawhi Leonard, Westbrook, Giannis, Harden, Anthony Davis, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Draymond Green, Kyrie Irving, Dame Lillard, Luka Doncic, Nicola Jokic, Rudy Gobert.  Guys like Ben Wallace and potentially Vince Carter have recently lowered the floor quite a bit."
Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert.
"Rudy is literally unplayable in the playoffs, why would Celtics trade a all nba level wing for a trash gobert on a 200m contract 🤡"
Why would Celtics trade jaylen brown for Rudy trash gobert lmfao
A Rudy Gobert but with post moves.
"I mean he blew a 3-1 lead to the Nuggets last year. Then in 2019, he got sent home by Dame (though he was decent) Then in 2018, he got put out by rookie Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. We can keep going.   His shooting percentage in a bunch of those games are pretty bad. He underperforms more than he shows out."
"Which is a joke, voted on by a media who sucks him off any chance they get. How many all star games? Rudy Gobert sucks on offense but makes the all star game and all NBA teams. Bev is not in the top half of best defenders in the league without the bullshit he gets away with. And even with it I could come up with at least 50 dudes I'd rather have defensively."
"'Crushing the soul' is subjective. Making a game winner or blocking a game winner is not subjective.   Rudy Gobert blocked a possible game winner against the Clippers in this play offs, so that is a plus point to him too."
"PG Steph  SG Tyler Herro  SF Kevin Durant  PF Giannis A.  C Rudy Gobert   Bench: Ben Simmons, Jae Crowder, Montrezl Harrell"
"Well I mean Simmons is 24 so it’s not like he’s old, so you could in theory move him to a small ball center type role and build around that. He’s still a top defender in the NBA and a great facilitator, he’s just not scorer at all with a really bad shot. Not entirely disagreeing with you that he could end up as filler, but it’s not insane to think someone might try and build around him instead of just dumping him. He’s like Rudy Gobert in a way: Gobert provides a nice floor for your team and is a great defensive anchor, but he’s not carrying a team anywhere. He does what he does and it’s earned him a max contract.   All this being said, the last place I want Ben Simmons is on my fucking team so I don’t really care what happens to him once he’s gone."
Injuries and Rudy Gobert
"He does if Trae ""Rudy Gobert"" Young is there to intimidate him"
Easily Danuel House lol  Honorary mention: Rudy Gobert being a complete idiot and shutting the whole league down
Hasn’t been the same since he sent his son Rudy Gobert on a one-way trip to Cancun
Yeah the answer to this hypothetical would be Rudy Gobert
"COVID incubates anywhere from 7-14 days. Mitchell and Gobert both tested positive within days of the other.  It’s completely possible that Don was infected first, infected Rudy, but didn’t test positive until after Rudy."
"Once upon a time our FO had the difficult decision of choosing two big men between Enes Kanter, Rudy Gobert, and Derrick Favors."
Rudy gobert is good
Rudy Gobert
didnt rudy gobert win DPOY with exactly these same problems
"I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it was because Rudy Gobert carried an even worse group of defenders to the best rated defense in the regular season per CleaningTheGlass, and Hakeem is better than Rudy."
"One of the most surreal nights of my life.  In a 30 minute span I discovered:  -Tom Hanks tested positive -Rudy Gobert tested positive  -NBA season was possibly cancelled -That I was in an arena with 20,000 people as a pandemic is kicking off"
Considering they’ve already lost to a team led by Evan Fournier and Rudy Gobert I’m going to say yes
"They definitely could. That’s the last three MVPs(Giannis &amp; Jokic)  with possibly the next mvp(Luka Magic) Add some guys like Rudy Gobert, Fournier, and some other shooters and they definitely could beat the best US team. Kobe wasn’t lying when he said the world has caught up!"

"Don't worry. Those are people that call Rudy Gobert a trash defender because he can't defend 2 players in the same time.     Towns is a good (not great, not bad, just good) rim protector but all of his career he had trash defenders so he had to chose, either stay to his man under the basket (allow points for guard) or contest the drive so there is either a floater or an alley-oop."
"yes its a really simple concept, Rudy Gobert cannot shoot, is he unskilled? No, he is a phenomenal defender and adds a lot of value for that reason alone. Would people say he is unskilled because he cannot shoot though? Yes."
Zero  Women just can't keep up with dudes biologically. Aint no shame bout it  Rudy Gobert had more dunks in a single game than the WNBA in like its entire 25 year history
He would be a wonderful backup for Rudy Gobert. Don’t think it’ll happen but it would be nice.
Fuck Rudy Gobert  https://youtu.be/SPSZTvXfc1Y
"Ben Simmons, Rudy Gobert, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant."
Man the Rudy Gobert slander was at an all time high after this game lol.
I mean its just a horrible matchup for him it doesn’t mean he is a bad defender  Rudy gobert has horrible matchups but he’s still the best defensive anchor in the league with only draymond coming close and maybe giannis when he plays the 5
Rudy Gobert should be in a lot of these.
You can say almost the same about Rudy Gobert and he is extremely valuable.
"&gt; his stats do not paint an accurate picture   &gt; Barrett does bad in most advanced stats  Advanced stats should not be used in a vacuum, otherwise Rudy Gobert is a top 10 player in the league"
Jesus top 75 ALL TIME and people are naming Marc Gasol and Rudy Gobert.  In what fucking world are either of those guys in the top 75 greatest players to ever play the game?
"PG Steph   SG Booker   SF Durant   PF Ben Simmons   Center Rudy Gobert    Bench: Grayson Allen, Zaza,Jae Crowder"
Haddadi is just Rudy Gobert with a post game and a 3pt shot
He is so good in D he forget how to score personally he should be dpoy than Rudy gobert
"&gt;I’d imagine the warriors can get a minimum 2 border line Allstars or 1 borderline superstar/ top tier alll star.  Who?  I mean seriously. Last year's all star teams included al to of ""borderline all-stars"" because of the number of players who dropped out. Here are the rosters:  Beal, Irving, Giannis, KD, Emiid, Jaylen Brown, Harden, Lavine, Simmons, Randle, Sabonis, Tatum, Vucevic, Curry, Doncic, LeBron, Kawhi, Jozic, Booker, Conley, Lillard, Mitchell, CP3, AD, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   Which of those players is available?   Maybe Lavine, if you make a godfather offer?  Does Lavine turn these Warriors into title contenders? Maybe Vucevic? Maybe Conley.   That's probably it.   Which of those deals get you excited? I mean, you're talking two borderline all-stars, so if the Warriors can get Lavine and Vuce ... okay, that's interesting. Does it strike you as somethign that might actually happen?"
"100%, I’m actually not even sure why my previous comment is being downvoted. Siakam is probably a better defender than Bridges if they had similar offensive loads for sure, all im saying is that they have different strengths as defenders. Much like Kawhi Leonard and Rudy Gobert are different."
Read this headline as Rudy Gobert and read way too many comments in search of the math making sense. Rudy Gay does make a lot of sense.
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler… are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
OG was playing defence on rudy gobert one game. Barnes was guarding 1 to 5 in college. Siakam can d up guards.  You could legit have 3 players who could be really good defenders switching 1 to 5
Can anybody find the clip of him pronouncing Rudy Gobert?
"I've legit said ""Westbrook is the Rudy Gobert of point guards"" before lol"
For me actually.   look out I’m going to dunk on Rudy gobert
"True. In the same vein, tell his teammates (sans Conley) to not have tunnel vision with the ball because against that small lineup there were multiple times where Gobert was wide open or had actively sealed a much smaller player and Donovan and co didn’t even look in his direction. You can blame Rudy for missing against smaller opponents sure, but missing him MULTIPLE times while wide open is on his teammate s"
Answer this. Do you think rudy gobert is a better player than westbrook? That'll let me know if you are a troll that only attacks people based on flairs or not.
"Cool, doesn’t mean they are harder to exploit than Gobert lol   I’d rather have Turner than Rudy"
"Rudy Gobert guarding Russ would be a catastrophic mistake because AD is on the floor and I'm sorry, Royce O Neal and Jingles aint getting that done."
"You're assuming that leaving your man and helping is a negative in this scenario.  Opposing teams are gonna let whoever fire and then just camp out at the rim.  Hell, if I was the Jazz I would put fucking Rudy Gobert or another bigger guy on Russ and just wait at the rim. Every possession Russ decides to shoot is a win for the defense."
"Rudy didn’t play DPOY level defense in the series but it also wasn’t all his fault. The jazz have very weak perimeter defenders, especially with a hobbled mitchell and Conley. The clippers exploited that, and Gobert isn’t mobile enough to cover a stretch 5 and protect the rim, so the end of possessions are cashed in on his man due to the shortcomings of the Jazz defense."
The 2013 nba draft is kinda wild. No top 10 picks are any good. But after that you have giannis and Rudy gobert. (Also Steven adams).   I can’t think of another draft where the top 5 players were this bad but was a semi decent draft
"So you know he's a limited player, but since I said the name ""Rudy Gobert,"" we have to pretend he's not so you can be sure to dunk on Rudy.  Point to the season when Gobert had the personnel around him to justify an expectation that the Jazz would make the conference finals."
"So you are intentionally being bad faith got it.   Ben Simmons is 25, Rudy Gobert is 29   Ben Simmons was on a team that took the eventual champions to 7 games, every time the Jazz get past the first round they get embarrassed"

Simmons is capable of it is my point   Every player in the league has exploitable weaknesses   Some are big enough to stop you from ever being good enough to contend for a title: Rudy Gobert   And some are made up for by what you give you team even when your weaknesses are being exploited: Ben Simmons   Make sense?
If Ben Simmons played to his regular season or past post season level of play they would’ve won that series and maybe made and won the finals   There’s no reality where a team paying Rudy Gobert the max contends for a title seriously
"Idk, we're getting close to the regular season vs. playoffs contribution idea for players. We've seen that discussion with Rudy Gobert arise countless times.  The fans' consensus is that a player with demonstrated exploitable weaknesses will be taken advantage of in the playoffs, and since the point of any FO is to win a title - which definitionally requires winning in the playoffs - then that should mean the player loses value despite how much they *can* contribute.   But FOs don't seem to be reacting the same way - Rudy still got his $210m extension from the Jazz, and it looks like Simmons will be held on to, too. Should be interesting to see how things unfold."
Yeah but physical bigs like Rudy gobert would feast
Rudy Gobert is an actual yearly dpoy. You think teams are lining up to trade for him if he were offered. DPOY and Allstar selections mean nothing when you're on as big a contract as Simmons or Gobert and actively hurt your team in the playoffs when it counts.
"Its a failure on a team level, no one is without fault in that series vs the Clippers  The Jazz basically put Rudy Gobert in the worst possible situation, they were without Mike Conley and no one else looked particularly competent at getting *something* out of Gobert on offense. Clippers could afford to go small since they realized Gobert can't create for himself at all even against the smaller Batum/Morris  Then defensively, his team mates basically hung him out to dry. It was ridiculously easy for the Clippers to beat their man on the perimeter, forcing Gobert to slide over as the help defender which leaves gaps in the defense. The Clippers then pinged the ball around quickly until they found an open shooter from deep."
"Gobert played pretty much all of his minutes with Conley on the floor this year barring injury  He really needed him on the offensive end. Ingles and Mitchell are decent at the point in a pinch, but not having a true point guard on the floor that series really killed us and made Rudy look bad"
"Capela, Thybulle, Embiid, Ayton, Brook and many others had far superior DEF RAPTOR for the Playoffs.  Rudy was 43RD ON PLAYOFF DWS LIST, 43RD! He had a DWS 5x less than Giannis.  Gobert was 29th in Playoff DBPM, with Mattise having like 4x higher DBPM.  Gobert was 65th in Playoff DEFRTG.  You wanna show Goberts playoff DRPM?"
"Clippers literally sent 5 shooters out there. Morris,Mann,PG,Reggie,Batum all shot 40% 3PT and benched our center Zu and exploited that but the issue with the Jazz was Mitchell and everyone not named Gobert needing help to guarding their man and needing Rudy to help in every drive. Rudy didn’t get exposed, Jazz defense got exposed"
"This is a bit of an oversimplification, and it depends what people mean by ""exposed"".  If they mean Gobert isn't a good defender in the playoffs, then it's clearly wrong.  But if they mean Gobert isn't the best defender in the playoffs, when he's so clearly the best in the regular season, then it's right.  Rudy's fast for his size but he doesn't have the footspeed to close out to shooters aggressively or they attack the closeout and get by him. This doesn't happen with AD, Giannis, Draymond, Bam, ...  Rudy in the right scheme against the right teams = most impactful defender in the world  BUT there are schemes and lineups against which his defensive impact can be largely neutralised, which isn't the case for the more versatile, mobile defenders like the 4 I mentioned.  Could AD and Giannis do an approximation of what Rudy does as a rim protector ? Yes. They'd be worse than him but can still have DPOY level impact there.  Can Rudy do what AD did last playoffs (showing high on Lillard ball screens and recovering to the paint, guarding 4-on-3 situations after the guards doubled Harden, switching the Jokic/Murray PnR, shutting down Butler) or Giannis these playoffs (shutting down Butler, switching out on Phoenix' guards, abandoning drop coverage) or Draymond in the '19 playoffs (shutting down Lou/Trezz PnR, trapping Lillard high screens without getting blown by, etc) ? No, Rudy couldn't do those things at all."
"&gt; maybe 5 practices  lol I mean its 3 on 3. not actual legit top-level international competition. I would happily put money on a roster comprised soley of 35-40 year old nba (or recently retired nba) players with *zero* practices together, hell pick 3 dudes that have never even *met* eachother.... I'm sure I'll get downvoted for being an ignorant american here, but nba dudes would have a cakewalk to gold in this event with this field. Rudy Gobert and Luka Doncic aint walkin thru that door lol"
"I was curious, so I looked up how many teams have been able to draft an all-star outside the top ten picks of the draft since 2013. Here's the complete list.  Denver - Jokic and potentially MPJ  LAC - SGA  Miami - Bam and maybe Herro  Milwaukie - Giannis  Minnesota - Zach Lavine  OKC - Sabonis  Phoenix - Booker  Toronto - Siakam  Utah - Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert  Honorable mentions  Atlanta - No but John Collins is close  Kings - Potentially Haliburton in the future  That's an average of a little more than one all-star per year. Again, I'm intending to defend Neil Olshey here, but so many blazers fans have it in their head that we were ""just a good pick"" away from contending, as though any team is able to consistently find all-stars at the back half of the draft."
"He had like 7 blocks in a game, he's rudy gobert lite, he'll be near there in a few years"
"I guess not...   Seth Curry, Rudy Gobert, and Christian Woods definitely didn't play in that league right? /s"
"Did they forget Simmons, Embiid, Siakam, Jamal Murray, Rudy Gobert, and others would be on Team World?"
"I am not joking with you at all when I say this. You can go look at my post/comment history when I’ve brought it up a few times.  I have a friend that’s a normally very knowledgeable guy about the NBA albeit he likes to be a hot take artist sometimes.   He tried saying Andre Drummond was better than Rudy Gobert. I was honestly floored at such a terrible take, but he has doubled down so many times."
That number 15 for Iran looks like an old version of rudy gobert
Rudy Gobert is also incredibly effective against teams without a good gameplan to neutralize him. Doubly so in FIBA.
"Except Klay wont be just catching and shooting only during the entire 82 games + playoffs. How did he get injured two times from? A dunk attempt and i believe in the scrimmage it was a lay up attempt. He still needs to do all the other basics in basketball. Hes still going to need to go up and down the court, he still needs to play decent defense i doubt hes going to just stand in a corner / casually walk to the other side. Hes also going to do lay ups when it's there.   Defense is overrated currently due to NBA rewarding offense more than defense (shooters can casually push into defenders and get the foul calls etc). We can even trade for Rudy Gobert and have 3 defensive players of the years and Warriors will get elminated due to lack of scoring. I dont need/want to see any more Warriors scoring revolving on Steph only / hoping Klay comes back to form from 2 major injuries."
"That's why I'm not saying it doesn't benefit him. I'm saying the strengths of his game don't rely on a large wingspan, and the weaknesses in it wouldn't be compounded by a smaller wingspan. Would he be a worse player with shorter arms? Yes. However, someone like Rudy Gobert would be hurt way more significantly by having shorter arms than a guy like Dame. Putting an expectation on any given player based on wingspan pre draft is only valuable through the lens of the context in which they affect said player's game."
"Sure!  1. Adrian Dantley 2. Alex English 3. Wilkins 4. Kidd 5. Melo 6. Pau Gasol 7. Tony Parker 8. Chris Mullin 9. Mitch Redmond 10. Webber 11. Penny Hardaway 12. Brandon Roy 13. David West 14. Zach Randolph 15. Prince 16. Rudy Gobert 17. Mark Eaton 18. Richard Jefferson 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Demar DeRozan 21. Deandre Jordan 22. Devontae Graham 23. Aaron Gordon 24. Josh Richardson 25. Ramon Sessions 26. Juan Toscano-Anderson 27. Nerlens Noel 28. Maxi Kleber 29. Eric Bledsoe 30. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  These thirty are all convincingly ahead of him too imo, so that eliminates him from being top sixty."
Ask Team USA how mediocre Rudy Gobert is
27 teams could've had Rudy Gobert  13 teams could've had Donovan Mitchell  All 30 teams could've had Draymond Green  All 30 teams could've had Nikola Jokic  We can play this game all day lol
"Deandre Jordan is actually more like Rudy Gobert, worse defense, cooler dunks."
"Forgot all about that guy. Plus Erick Green and cash for Rudy Gobert. A couple rough trades in hindsight.  Jokes aside though, Davion would be a great fit in Denver. I like that move if Denver can swing it somehow"
Like Rudy Gobert?
"Mo was just as much if not more of an outlier. 7' with a 7'10"" wingspan, had his head above the rim on one of his dunks, 3.7 blocks a game, allegedly faster sprint time than John Wall. He was supposed to be Rudy Gobert but way more athletic and with a 3pt shot."
Rudy Gobert is faaaaaar more impactful on the offensive end as a roll guy/offensive rebounder than Thybulle is able to provide. Not to mention being infinitely more valuable on defense.
Rudy Gobert has entered the chat.
Rudy gobert will continue to be a more impactful player than westbrook and westbrook's fans will continue acting like it's a crazy idea.
Rudy Gobert
"I get it. You watched the Clippers series. There's an entire body of work during the regular season and you have no idea what you're talking about. ""25% of his shots from three"" is not a meaningful stat. It just means he stretches the floor more than, say, Rudy Gobert can.  If simply switching could shut down his pick-and-roll, let me emphasize this again, he would not be the single most efficient combo in the NBA, with Luka."
Shit works for Rudy Gobert. And Adams is closer to Gobert defensively than JV
Rudy Gobert
He can't create his own offence. The second you start switching KP pick and roll he mine as well be Rudy Gobert. About 20% of his baskets were unassisted last season which is in the range of players like Willy Cauley Stine and Dwight Powell.  You can guard KP with Reggie Jackson and he is incapable of getting a quality look.
All I know is Denver traded Utah two first round picks in two separate trades that would become Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. And the Gobert pick was exchanged for *cash considerations.*  Lol what.
yeah Pop made the team missed 3 straight wide open shots and told them not to drive because they have Rudy Gobert at the rim
Nah a team like the Jazz would start playing a zone defense with 4 players guarding the 3 point line and Rudy Gobert never leaving the paint.
RUDY GOBERT !!!!
Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert
Attacking the paint with Rudy Gobert in the middle with no defensive 3 seconds to worry about and no one other than maybe Durant that can force him to come out the paint?....good luck with that
Leave it to this sub to not mention gobert asking non American centers in the thread about his team shutting down team usa and in direct response to a comment thread about Rudy specifically lmao
"im new to this whole basketball thing, sorry in advance if this is a stupid question. i know Rudy Gobert is french but he plays for the NBA in the US, why is he playing for France? is it a citizenship thing?"
People are joking about this but Gobert is a MUCH better player without the three second rule  If they put that in the NBA all you would need is decent perimeter defense and Rudy would be basically unstoppable
"All season I heard people talk about how people shouldn't sleep on the Jazz and that Rudy Gobert is one of the best defensive players in history and y'all blow like a 26 point lead as a first seed with the best defense in the league supposedly with D-Mitch on fire to Terrance fucking Mann and Reggie Jackson.   I don't care if Mike Conley was hurt, choking like that is unacceptable for any contender and a first seed"
"I think the more likely explanation is that nba players don’t try to dunk against Rudy gobert, the best shot blocker in the nba."
Because France has Rudy fucking Gobert lmao
"Sure, practicing together makes a big difference, but it has nothing to do with a talent drop off like you mentioned in your last comment.  Talent-wise, the gap between Team USA and Top NBA players is smaller than Team USA and Team France.  I didn't say France was all scrubs, I said they have a few good players. If that roster played an entire NBA schedule, I'd be surprised if they're anything more than a lottery team. Rudy Gobert gives them a solid defense by default but their primary offensive option is Evan Fournier and their second option is an aging Batum. These guys are good NBA players, but they shouldn't be 1st and 2nd options on good teams. The other guys on the team are close to NBA replacement level or probably worse than that. Best left is probably TLC and I wouldn't be shocked if he's out of the league in a few years. He's played five seasons (including a few with the Sixers so I've seen him play a good bit) and he shoots under 40% for his career.  Again, I get your point that playing together is important but talent-wise there's a big gap here."
I just don't think the teams the US has faced this year are better than the teams the USA has faced in previous Olympics. That's just a cop out.   It's not like we just lost to a team with Jokic/Giannis/Emiid/Luka. We lost to Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier...
"all are in the top 10 of worst contracts in the NBA along with John Wall,  Kevin Love, and Rudy Gobert"
The best player on France is Rudy Gobert and he would definetely make team USA.
I lost a ton of brain cells reading these threads for real  Yeah just drive on Rudy gobert who doesn't have to leave the paint and finish strong its easy /s
"Yeah, he only has Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard and a bunch of other All-stars. They're getting outplayed by Rudy Gobert, Evan Fournier and Frank Ntilikina."
"Tatum wasn't even trying on defense. He was going under screens on shooters, leaving his assignment to quadruple Rudy Gobert, and letting his man sneak behind him for offensive boards."
"Without Terrance Mann to neutralize him, Rudy Gobert is virtually unstoppable. smh"
This is not a meaningful post. Team USA lost to Evan Fournier and Rudy Gobert not a team a team with Luka/Jokic/Embiid/Giannis.
Rudy Gobert bébé
"“That’s a hell of a team”    Frank Ntilikina, Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot, Thomas Heurtel, Nicolas Batum, Guerschon Yabusele, Evan Fournier, Nando de Colo, Fenerbahçe	, Vincent Poirier, Andrew Albicy, Gran Canaria, Rudy Gobert, Petr Cornelie, Pau-Lacq-Orthez, Moustapha Fall  Edit - grammer"
Rudy Gobert like to have a word with you/s
"Honestly you're still doing it.  He does not have the limitations as a player that people think.  Gobert does have the ability to punish people down low, as he has shown consistently and repeatedly the last 3-4 years.  Just look at the way he played in the Olympics, he was destroying Durant and Bam one on one in the post.  He did the same thing against Jokic last year.  The reason the Jazz didn't play that way against the Clippers is because they didn't have the guard play to get Rudy the ball in a position to be dominant in that way.  The Clippers were 64% TS in that series.  Rudy is a more efficient post player than that, but that's because he pretty much only takes the shots where he has an open look at the rim.   Conley was out. Mitchell was hurt, so while he was still really effective as a scorer had had almost no ability as a playmaker.  And Ingles was exposed in that series as someone who athletically is last the point where he can be an individual playmaker on a night to night basis.  The Clippers were pressing and trapping to get the ball out of his hand to people that were less capable of running the offense.   Once the Clippers went small, Gobert didn't have the ability to shoot 70% TS because he didn't have anybody to get him the ball.  The Clippers had a TS of 64% that series.  To put it into perspective, the highest Shaq ever got in his prime was about 60%.  When he is grinding down low and getting to the line a lot, the team loses, simply because that's how the game is played now.   If you can do it with the ball in your hand like Giannis or KD that's one thing, but he needs elite guard play to be elite on the offensive end and have that crazy high efficiency he's known for."
"Yeah, I’d probably swap the Warriors and the Jazz honestly. I think Rudy was a big addition who offers the Jazz some good lineup versatility with/without Gobert. Losing Oubre/Bazemore will probably hurt the Warriors defense, and Porter Jr and Klay are big unknowns at this point. The Warriors certainly could be there by the end of the season, but they could just as well struggle a bit as they assimilate/Klay tries to return to form."
Rudy Gobert. The man will make any team by himself a 5 seed. Just saying. Don't have to like it but is what it is
This reminds me of that Rudy Gobert joke where he touched and coughed on all the mics then tested positive and the NBA shut down.
"KAT is a better offensive player, no one is denying that. But he's poor defensively, while Rudy is the most impactful defender in the league. Gobert would obviously be a terrible ""first option"" on any team, but that isn't his role. And, what's KAT done as first option himself.."
"The arc matters a ton. It’s simple physics. Yes, practice helps, but the angle of release massively changes the shot. Saying that big guys just need to practice it is like saying Steph Curry needs to practice shot blocking so that he can be like Rudy Gobert on defense. There are physical limitations."
"They had a chance this year to win, but Mitchell’s ankle was obviously still injured in the 2nd round. Conley was out with a hamstring. Mitchell and Clarkson shot poorly after game 3 vs. the clippers. Denver always have our number and with Austin rivers there, the jazz are in trouble. Adding Rudy gay, paschall, and whiteside is an upgrade to niang and favors. They are definitely 9-10 deep. I’m sure Gobert will work more offensively this off-season but I wouldn’t be surprised if the jazz get 1-3 seed this year. Donavan is not on the level of dame yet(close), but if he was the jazz could be a 60-win team."
The advanced stats say Rudy Gobert is a top 5 player in the league
It's absolutely valid to rank KAT behind Gobert. Rudy by himself guarantees you a top defense regardless of what's around him.
"As an NBA fan with Rudy Gobert on his team, I absolutely love it, and I wish the NBA had a similar rule."
"&gt; You just need height, and length to be a good post scorer.   This seems like a troll take. What about all those tall and long players that aren't good post scorers?  &gt; What's stopping guys like Rudy to just do this and become dominant offensively  ""Just become dominant offensively"" is a troll take.  Also Utah probably doesn't need Gobert to become an elite scorer. Utah needs Gobert to be a fine enough scorer and an elite defender."
"It takes very elite post skills for a center to actually be able to generate enough ppp for teams to want to run part of their offense through them. Rudy gobert isn’t going to come back after the summer with embiid/jokic like touch, so there’s no point. The big man post up is “dead” unless we’re talking about an actual star player with amazing talent. If gobert actually took a summer to try to improve his post game he’d just come back looking like Andre Drummond"
"Why does Rudy Gobert, the largest center, not simply eat the other centers?"
"And Gobert is in a spot where he's like an elite cornerback in football. There's seven or eight times a game where an opposing wing gets past a Jazz defender with a run at the rim, only Rudy is there and the ballhandler just turns around and nopes out."

"You really think that's how FG% work?  Last year Joe Harris lead the league in 3PT FG% (not Steph) and Rudy Gobert (47.5%) lead the league in 2PT FG% (68%, also not Step.))  Steph shot 42% and 57% respectively.   Last year the Nets had the best 2PT FG% at 56.6% and the Clippers shot best from 3 at 41.1%. The Warriors shot 54% from 2 and 37.7%  from 3.   So yeah there are both players and teams that equal Steph's shooting on the offensive end. Offensive production doesn't have to come all from one player, and it's better that it doesn't. Hero ball loses in the playoffs more than it wins. With that being the case, Steph's horrible defense is what prevents him from being the best player in the L (or even top 3, maybe 5.)   Everybody loves scoring, but it's only half the game."

Rudy Gobert  people gonna look at his DPOYs and think he's the best defensive player ever when he gets targeted in the playoffs every year
"Would Rudy Gobert be in the GOAT convo if he played in the 1950s? I'm assuming he would, right?"
He did this even early in his career before Sabonis became a starter and they played a lot   He doesn’t have many functional offensive skills him in the paint doesn’t do much. He’s become a solid roll man but he’s not a Clint capela Rudy Gobert level type for sure. Can’t rebound. No ability to attack switches. No shot creation or face up game. Zero playmaking. He’s a negative offensive player regardless of role  He is a floor spacer by choice because relative to other 5s he has more skill as a shooter. That doesn’t mean he actually provides any real floor spacing though it’s just the nature of the position the stretch 5 outside of a few cases is all fake
"You make it sound like Giannis is Rudy Gobert on offense, when in reality he finished 5th in the NBA in scoring this year."

Rudy Gobert is every bit as good as his contract suggests.
Rudy gobert and kawhi are the two most overrated players in the nba.
PG: CP3  SG: Danny Green  SF: PG13  PF: Kyle Kuzma  C: Rudy Gobert
"Okay, if steals isn’t good enough, his defensive rating for his career was 105.5. League average right now is 110 and Rudy Gobert led the league with 100. Coupled with how many minutes he averaged in his career, he’s far from the liability on defense that you’re trying to make him out to be. We can keep comparing apples to oranges all day if you’d like, because with today’s NBA’s emphasis on passing and spacing, he could have easily had a higher 3pt% without as many contested threes. Good thing you didn’t circle back to the playmaking argument I guess. Overall this is a dumb argument either way and I feel dumber for having it with you."
I totally agree but I think it’s underrated how much losing Conley affected the Jazz. He’s the only one on the team who can give Rudy the kinda passes he needs to turn and dunk it. Ingles can do it sometimes but he gets to tired when playing starter minutes to do it consistently. Some games in the olympics Gobert had strong offensive performances because the French guards were consistently finding him with lobs.
"Is Middleton a better scorer than Giannis? Was Vince Carter better than Shaq? No they are/were more versatile. Versatility is important, but what really matters is if teams can stop you from scoring the ball. I watched both Carmelo and LeBron a lot, and LeBron was better at scoring the ball, most teams just couldn’t stop him as he went to the rim at will. Maybe he didn’t score in as many ways, but still was better, as evidenced by, the points he scored.   What you’re saying is that he is the better iso scorer. Ok, but why does this make Carmelo a better scorer in general? With Lebron, we’re talking about someone that has averaged 35+ points on multiple playoff series. How is this possible by taking only “shots where his efficiency is highest”, as if he’s a Rudy Gobert or something."
"Rudy Gobert should have never won a DPOY award. He never guards any of the best scorers in the league. A DPOY should be your guy to stop KD, Steph, Lillard, etc."
"Rudy Gobert is a better defender then Draymond Green, Ben Simmons or Giannis rn, and I'd underrated offensively"
Rudy gobert is very overrated. Wouldn’t put him in my top 30 playoff players. I’m a strong believer of the importance of playoff basketball
"All of these aren't that hot for me, but they're still unpopular enough.  For #2, Embiid is more important and Thybulle is more impactful as a help defender. Spending time with Embiid, Tobias Harris, and Danny Green on the floor allows Ben Simmons a lot of freedom to hound his man, with a lot of help to cover up his mistakes.  For #5, the whole team made a huge step up, but having a strong veteran presence at point guard does do wonders for an offense. Still, improvements from the whole roster (Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Payne, Johnson), solid veteran role players, and really good depth made the Suns team strong.  For #7, a quick qualifier. Gobert's offense down low is not good (we know this all too well), but Conley's injury really hurt him on that end too. The guys were just not finding him anymore once Conley sat out. Possession after possession, you'd see Gobert get solid position down low with plenty of space around him so he can turn and do a quick dunk or finger roll and he just would not get the ball. The Suns experienced this a bit too, where Ayton got a bit frozen out against the Clippers despite having strong games initially.  Also, Gobert is actually quite good at perimeter defense and iso defense, but the 5 out scheme really messed with the Jazz roster, since we have only undersized guards and unathletic wings. Clarkson and a hobbled Mitchell were blown past on too many possessions and having unathletic wings means that they can't help with rim protection (aren't much of a force in the paint because of minimal verticality and too slow to close out after helping). It's a sacrifice the team made, considering they knew they could count on Rudy to force bad shots in the paint, but it's still a team shortcoming."
"My unpopular opinion is that Rudy Gobert did all he needed to do against the Clippers, they just got unlucky that a role player had a performance that was 4 standard deviations above his mean. UTAH was the better team they just got unlucky."
7 is objective truth but Rudy Gobert is annoying so people have decided “French man bad”
"Yeah I think Ben Simmons is a great defender but he doesn't deserve to be in DPOY talks at all. I think Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, and Joel Embiid are all noticeably more impactful defenders than him."

"Rudy Gobert averaged 14.3 ppg while leading the league in FG%, total blocks, total rebounds, plus minus, won DPOY and was top 2 in multiple advanced stats while playing for the best team in the league and only missing one game. He finished 10th in MVP voting behind Derrick Rose. So almost definitely not"
"shoutout to Shawn Bradley. Dude leads the NBA in block% by a huge margin. He's at 7.9% and the next highest is around 7.1% and he's 9th all time in BPG at 2.5 for his career, despite playing off the bench most of his career and averaging around 20-25 mpg.   Yet despite his incredible timing, ability to deter shots and protect the rim, he is reduced to a meme about getting dunked on. Which admittedly happened a lot! But he was an all time great shot blocker. per100 possessions, Bradley peaked at around 7 blocks a game, last season Rudy Gobert averaged a little over 4 blocks per 100 possessions."
Boston Rondo was still taking 35-40% of shots outside 10 feet. So he’s wasn’t a non-shooter the way Simmons is.   Simmons has a Rudy Gobert shot profile. He took less than 10% of shots outside 10 feet last season.
"Missing Rudy Gobert, better than KCP"
"Theo Maledon, Killian Hayes, Sekou Doumbouya, Victor Wembanyama, Rudy Gobert."
Oh Rudy Gobert wasnt moving him the other night.
"My ancestors were on the mayflower, while theirs were needing to be bailed out of a world war! Freedom! Rudy Gobert can’t stop our 2nd team!!"
I remember Gobert getting flamed by them but I don't think he called them out on it. Think it was someone else but they were definitely talking about Rudy when it happened
Some combination of them and Rudy Gobert. Idk that there’s a realistic comp
Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert Good.
"Prime Tyson Chandler was basically a slightly less good Rudy Gobert. Doesn’t leap off the screen but super efficient offensively while making space with screens, and can cover for a lot of mistakes defensively."
"Rudy Gobert, Giannis, Ingram, KD. As a big, he needs to bulk like Rudy and Giannis did, but at his age, metabolism, and height it's normal to be this underdeveloped physically. KD couldn't bench 185 out of college."
"100% hit the nail on the head. You're legit the first person I've seen outside of Nate Duncan and Big Wos to give Turner props lmao. You let Pacers fans tell it you'd think Turner was some overrated, overpaid scrub and Domas is basically Jokic w/o the marketing.   Then again you understand the impact on winning that an elite defensive center has w/Rudy so salute to you. Obviously Myles isn't in that elite center tier w/Jokic, Embiid, Gobert, and AD^when ^he ^feels ^like ^playing ^the ^5 but Turner's 4/$70 million gtd. deal s great value for the impact he has imo.   What's funny is that he made $17.5 million the past 2 years, and at best can bump that up to $19.5 million the next year if he hits his unlikely All-NBA **and** All-Defense incentives which would make his contract highway robbery lol."
"My point is that even the MLE is much more than the minimum.  To your point, we're seeing teams go in both directions. For Phoenix, Kaminsky was unplayable during the playoffs so they spent a bit more money to get JaVale McGee. For Utah, they got Rudy Gay who can hopefully take some minutes as a small-ball 5 if Gobert gets played off of the floor."
Jazz will just say that he was talking about Rudy Gobert.
"Rudy Gobert hit's 3pointers in practice too, why post this?"
"If i remember correctly, rudy gobert’s max extension was 208 million.   Rudy gobert gets paid more than luka."
Underpaid tbh. Rudy Gobert gets $200M from his team. For Luka to be at $207M doesnt make sense. He should be at $225M+
"If you ask the first take crew Donovan Mitchell is already number one😂😂😂😂, but I think a case can be made for Donovan Mitchell being third along with Rudy gobert when you look at the defense accolades, shout out to Deron Williams as well, even though he seemed to fall off a cliff out of nowhere"
"bruh you had second tier euroleaguers tryna score on Rudy Gobert. The similarity between Luka at the Olympics and early Cavs LeBron is that their supporting cast was complete dogshit.  &gt;Luka reminds me a lot of young LeBron, he can will winning games with talent alone but will come short of winning it all until he learns to really trust his teammates and play the game right.  This tells me you didn't watch basketball from 04-09. The PRIMARY criticism of LeBron was that he used to make the extra pass and trusted his shitty teammates too much. People asked why he'd pass out to an open corner three instead of trying to dunk over a double team.  ""No killer instinct""."
"I mean, 72% of Ayton's baskets are assisted. It was actually higher before CP3 was on the team at 76%. In the playoffs where Ayton was lauded for his performance, it was even higher. For context, Rudy Gobert who is the poster boy for zero offensive shot creation had 76% of his baskets assisted the last season.  Whether he can create his own shot more often is up for debate, but he doesn't."
"&gt;Tyson Chandler was a super athletic bouncy rebounder, shot blocker, and lob threat. We got people in here comparing him to Rudy Gobert because they both won DPOYs?  No but because Gobert is a super tall bouncy rebounder, shot blocker, and lob threat. He get his production in a different way but he's a similar type of player.  And Iguodala is an end of rotation guy now. Marion would've started on most teams in the NBA that year."
Mitchell Robinson  Rudy Gobert  DeAndre Jordan  Montrezl Harrell  Jerami Grant
Eh. Obviously biased but Utah built a 1 seed around Rudy Gobert. You can do it if properly constructed.
Harden posterized DPOY Rudy Gobert at the peak of his powers. Bad comparison.
"Because I actually watched them play instead of basing my opinion on players similarities to their basketball accomplishments on wikipedia?  Like how dense are some of you guys. Tyson Chandler was a super athletic bouncy rebounder, shot blocker, and lob threat. We got people in here comparing him to Rudy Gobert because they both won DPOYs? What? Do you guys have eyes?  Also Mavs Marion was washed. 2019 - 2021 Iggy is a great comparison. FMVP Iggy 5 years ago was way better than the version of Marion the Mavs had."
"Clippers or Jazz vs Mavs with Mavs losing so I can see this sub implode.   I can picture it right now, Rudy Gobert FMVP."
this just in: one of the greatest offensive players ever isoing Rudy Gobert on the perimeter leads to an easy bucket
I feel like the comp has to be Rudy gobert. Chandler was that valuable as a team defender
"I think he's concerned that being a one way player can lead to crippling the teams effectiveness in the playoffs. Something akin to what happened to the Jazz in this years playoffs when the Clippers went small ball, leaving Rudy Gobert on an island. However, this is probably a low chance, and if there's an option, it's easier to hide a bad defender than it is to operate an efficient offense with a bad player."
Lmao the mods finally had enough with the Rudy Gobert post. There was like 9 in a row at one point.
everybody hates rudy gobert
"Wtf is happening right now, every post is Rudy Gobert getting crossed 💀"
"Thank you for asking!  (in no particular order)  PG - Curry, Simmons, Fox, Killian Hayes, Rubio  SG - Kelly Oubre, Jalen Green, Lavine, Booker, Oladipo  SF - Tatum, Giannis, Aaron Gordon, Abdul Nader, Hayward  PF - Kuzma, Kevin Love, Hachimura, Ibaka, Obi Toppin  C - Nerlens Noel, Robert Williams III, Rudy Gobert, Daniel Gafford, Jarrett Allen"
"Yes and no. Believe it or not there is a cap on how much certain players can improve on their weaknesses. It’s not simply “put x amount of hours in and you’re guaranteed to be able to shoot”. Some players simply aren’t good enough to warrant shooting the ball in an actual game scenario. Simmons is one of these players and he knows it, which is why he doesn’t shoot. You guys think he can just “start shooting in the game” but if he did he’d end up being Westbrook level bad or worse. It’s like telling Rudy Gobert he should start shooting threes."
Bruh why u acting like AD is like Rudy Gobert lmao he was a beast in NO too as the 1st option. Even swept Dame’s team in 2018  You are correct that offense &gt; defense but AD is also a beast on that end while Dame and Luka are negatives on defense
Rudy Gobert
They are both elite rim protectors. I would even give Gobert the edge but I believe Joel is more comfortable and effective defending away from the rim and switching onto guards than Rudy.
"Goberts a good choice, only reason I went with AD is because he’s better all around in my opinion where as Gobert is the clear better rim protector. But with Giannis and AD I feel like Gobert would be a bit redundant so I took Kawhi. Can’t go wrong with Rudy tho"
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good. My favourite ""firm"" that operate in this particular sector of the game is ""The Ball Index"" ([twitter](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index)).

"""Rudy Gobert, out with an illness""  in retrospect, chock full of dramatic irony. if y'all only knew..."
"No, but I'm inferring since Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell had it that night. High probability that in an arena of 20K fans, maskless, it was spread easily."
"All the Utah Jazz players (current gen) get a lot of unnecessary crap. Karl Malone and John Stockton -- yeah, fuck them. But Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell don't deserve the hatred they get. They seem like good guys."
"&gt;I get the sense you don't enjoy the current game.  The game is fine, it's the officiating that is dragging the whole enterprise down.  I cannot really blame the players for taking four steps before shooting a three, if it is allowed by the officials, but that is not basketball.  &gt;But I love seeing all these great three point shooters. I know for an old school guy, it might seem like somebody is just using a cheat code on a video game, but that's some amazing skill.  That's the thing, it's not really amazing at all.  Players today are not better shooters than their predecessors, they are simply being allowed to disregard several significant sections of the rules of basketball.  We could see all manner of ""amazing"" things on court, if we just scrapped the rest of the rules as well.  We could ditch that pesky defensive goaltending rule, and be amazed to watch Rudy Gobert hold opposing teams to 10 points in an entire game.  But that wouldn't be basketball, and I kind of like basketball."
"they went against france that has one of the best defenders in history in rudy gobert and in general a extremely good team. guess what, they can lose, it happens in basketball. you cannot always have domination, tf is this? y'all americans really freaking pretend to win ALWAYS in a span of freaking 20 YEARS? one lost and boom underperfomed. and all this with a gold medal. y'all mad crazy lmao."
"Rudy Gobert has to be the player that takes the most shit for absolutely no reason.  He gets shit on for his contract, which he damn well earned.  He gets shit on for being emotional and caring about winning, which is absolutely crazy to me because so many guys get praised for the same thing."
"Nah it’s because Rudy is a covid spreading prick. Fuck Gobert, can’t wait for him to get played off the court in the playoffs next year for what…. The fourth time now?   It’s nothing about toxic masculinity or trying to stop men from showing emotion. It’s entirely about Rudy’s unique shittiness."
"Bull shit. It had been over 3 months since the emergence in China. Anyone paying any attention at all had seen the makeshift hospitals being built in a day to hold hundreds of patients.   My place of employment already had safety precautions in place as cases had been confirmed to be spreading in the US. Gobert was being an ignorant asshole about a virus that had already killed many. People in this thread literally argue that Rudy Gobert saved thousands of lives by single handedly starting a covid response, how fucking ignorant and sad.   Gobert will always be a prick for that. No other players had problems joking about covid and spreading it to others at neighboring lockers. I’m personally glad he is crying too. His dismissive attitude was not shared by anyone with compassion at that point. I don’t think the original commenter is unjustified for disliking him for displaying the same attitude that has prolonged this for over a year."
You’ve got to be kidding me LMAO Rudy Gobert saving thousands of lives 😂😂
Rudy Gobert
I just know if I ever see people saying Rudy Gobert is an MVP candidate again. I’m gonna lose my shit
"*Devin Booker filmed beating up a dude.*  r/nba: he’s just young, he’s maturing, he’s still my guy  *Rudy Gobert filmed crying when thinking of his mom*  r/nba: LOL WHAT A BABY BISMACK BAGUETTE AMIRITE"
"I mean can we chill, team USA full of all stars just went 1 and 1 and hardly beat France in the finals. France is led by rudy gobert, Evan Fornier and Nik batum. They should be destroying these teams tbh, it was pretty close and Rudy exposed the need for usa to get a true center and the tourney certainly exposed nba players lack of ability to play through physicality with nba refs calling touch fouls . Kd was able to because he is a walking bucket but peep guys like dame for example."
"Gobert a clown and clowns can cry too, no shame in being a sad clown. Beep beep, Rudy"
"Everybody is talking about how much closer the rest of the world is getting to the US, but I have to whole heartily disagree. The only reason these games were close is because team USA was horrendous offensively with their guard play. Don't get me wrong Luka and Giannis are top 5 in the world (evidence that the gap is narrowing) and more and more countries have NBA players on their olympic roster, but the games haven't been close since 2004 and they wouldn't have been this year.   Again the guard play.  I love Dame time, and Booker was amazing in the NBA playoffs and Hollidays defense was next level tonight but my god this team had no pick and roll action what so ever.  Like who the f\*ck was the POINT GUARD on this team? Team USA almost got rolled because France was annihilating them on the pick and roll. Seriously, they made Rudy Gobert look like the best player on the planet. Which is fine. I'll take Gobert missing half his free throws at the line. That wasn't the problem. The problem was team USA on offense.   Don't get me wrong KD was amazing and Tatum was too during stretches. But their offense was so disjointed and one dimensional. I get Steph probably didn't want to play bc he has has some bad luck with injuries the past few years, CP3 is aged out at this point for the same reason, and Kyrie as well, but this team really lacked someone like De'aron Fox, Ja Morant, or Trae Young. Like bruh, I could probably name 3 - 4 other logical choices. And not to mention TEAM USA had the opportunity to replace Kevin Love. So like maybe dudes didn't want to commit months ago / a year but they could have got an elite PG to commit last minute.  Even though Team USA won and it sounds like I'm being negative, I'm just point out that anyone who watched the last minute saw Team USA dodged a 2004 level bullet bc of poor roster construction.      One point guard please."
"This may be a stupid question but why do the French players get to wear jersey numbers higher than 15? (e.g., Rudy Gobert wearing #27) I thought players are only allowed to wear 4-15 for international competitions?"
Nothing Rudy Gobert did would have changed the NBA playing basketball. You are just being an asshole to a guy who made a mistake channel that anger at your government.
To quote Rudy Gobert:  Non  And I don't even like Durant.
"I'm sorry but this is just disrespectful for international bball. This is not 92 anymore. Team france have 2 times NBA DPOY, rudy gobert, 2 good nba starters and end of the bench nba players and euroleague players that have played together for years with fiba rules. They are not bums like most of teams that dream team faced.    Yes, team USA is still the most talented team in the world by some margin but this team is b team bar kevin durant, have only 2 weeks to prepare for the olympics which got disrupted by covid and some of their best players arrive a day before the olympics started because nba finals."
Rudy Gobert doesnt have a season where he doesn't win a ring if he replaces bill
"From what I gather this is the opinion of a random nba scout who spoke to ryan russillo. But even then there is no link to the original source at all and the entire article seems to just aggregate what was said which makes me a bit suspicious. If it’s convincing enough to you then cool but to me id like to see this from a legit sixers insider who’s actually reporting on the situation( or even a link to the original source if the article you posted) I don’t think thats a huge ask and if you can give me that ill definitely reconsider my position on Simmons   I saw Rudy Gobert pass up wide open dunks before and being completely unable to post up Luke Kennard. That doesn’t mean he’s not a hard worker, it just means he makes mistakes and lacks skill   J’avale looking like KD in practice has nothing to do with intelligence, its highlighting the dramatic difference between playing on a practice court vs an nba court. Everyone knows Javale would never be able to do that stuff on an actual court  I saw footage of Ben Simmons knocking down 3s like nothing during practice, [hell i found this on YouTube ](https://youtu.be/6ZKor0eb2Oc)   Obviously it doesn’t mean anything because off season practice never do. My point was to say that just because you see a person being bad at something on the basketball court doesn’t mean they don’t work hard on it. Sometimes we just gotta accept that certain players are straight bad at some things and will never be good at them, Ben Simmons shot can never be fixed but I think his offensive agression and confidence can be fixed under the right guidance. Thats why he gotta get a fresh start somewhere else  My pushback is based on the idea that fans are too easily susceptible to confirmation bias, like i said if you can give me a legitimate source that Ben Simmons doesn’t work hard then ill admit im wrong about him but unless you can it feels that the whole “ Ben Simmons doesn’t work hard” thing seems to be based on faulty reporting and nba media pushing narratives. Even intuitively, saying that a DPOY candidate/All star doesn’t work hard is kind of crazy to hear  Again if you can provide a legitimate source from a sixers insider or any credible reporter with a good track record or provide the link to the original report from the article so i can hear directly what was said then ill legitimately consider changing my mind. I have no problem admitting Simmons isn’t a hard worker if im getting that info from a legit source"
"This series when Jokic went from ""yeah, Denver fans, I get it, he's the best guy on your team"" to ""damn, this guy could be a league MVP"" for me.  If a 7 foot center can walk around Rudy Gobert like that, nobody in the NBA can deal with him."
"Dude what are you talking about? It’s not special to be efficient when all you can do is role to the rim and dunk. Go look at Rudy Gobert/DeAndre Jordan for example, hell even Holmes had a higher TS% than him the past two seasons. Please don’t call him one of the three most efficient big men in the history of the game it’s embarrassing. Also he’s 17/85 from 3 in his career, I highly doubt he’ll ever be a stretch big. Nobody was paying him 100 over 5, maybe another team would’ve gone to 80 but that still seems high to me."
"not what im saying, would you call rudy gobert a better dunker then peak VC because he finishes more per season?"
I will never forget Rudy Gobert for that reason
"I didnt change my opinion because of downvotes, I looked for 20 players I could confidently say are better and only found 18, so he is 19th on my list  Also put Rudy Gobert on that team  and they run the league for 2 decades"
Forgot Rudy Gay went to the Jazz and was wondering why Rudy Gobert would have mattered here lol
Anyone not named Rudy Gobert goes 'EzPz gg'
This man is making *half* as much as Rudy Gobert.  Crazy how Gobert was able to finesse a deal for a portion of the supermax.
"Ah yes, the under radar concern that is Rudy Gobert in the playoffs. So glad somebody finally noticed it"
"You know what I mean. Draymond’s value was really overstated in peak years. He WAS seen as an do it all star and warriors second best player. Like I said he was a 90 overall at one point. I’m not saying he was seen as the best player in the league, but he was seen as this transcendent star because of his unique skills. My argument here is his versatility is so good that yes he has become overrated,  because he can defend all 5 positions, has good court vision, and can stretch the floor (a bit), people assumed he was great at each of those qualities. His assists numbers are bloated because of Steph and Klay, and without Steph and Klay his offensive game is really lackluster. Is that to say that Draymond has no value? No. Look at Rudy Gobert like you said teams change their whole game plan playing against Utah. But you never hear “Rudy Gobert is the reason Utah is great, not Donovan Mitchell. He’s the heart and soul of Utah.” And let’s face it a lot of times people say things like that about Draymond because they think that makes them a basketball genius. Lol.   So what is Dray really? He’s a guy who has amazing court vision for his position, but assist numbers are a bit bloated. He’s a guy whose defense is not underrated at all, but fantastic. And a guy whose offensive game is really lacking, but has his moments. He’s basically a great role player anyone wants. But let’s not act like Steph and Klay and the system didn’t make him into a star!"
"I don’t think anyone thinks he is LeBron-esque, but peak Draymond on defense is way better than peak LeBron on defense. I wouldn’t ever count on LeBron to absolutely lock whoever he was guarding down 1 through 5 over the course of the season, but Dray can definitely do that game in and game out. Maybe LeBron could, but he is relied on too much offensively to give that effort all the time.   Sure, I’ll bite, idk how to talk to you if you compare Draymond to LeBron, but don’t also realize that the dude needs people around him to succeed. Sure, he’s not a great scorer, but if you think that is all basketball is about then you are immediately going to discount guys like Draymond or Rudy Gobert or any number of amazing players whose value is outside the box score.   Who the heck has ever said Draymond Green is like LeBron? You’re just creating a straw man argument you can easily counter, but idk anyone who would make that comparison."
"Yeah, and no one is going to trade Rudy Gobert for Jalen Smith. The point is that people are just pulling out of nowhere this assumption that Haliburton is a guaranteed all-star/all-nba player. He's a solid rookie with no superstar level skills/potential skills. Ben Simmons at 21 lead his team to the playoffs and ended their season on a crazy triple-double streak.  And what happened to him? Well, he never put in any effort to improve, stayed at the same level, and people started thinking it's a smart GM move to trade him for a worse player with lower upside. All-star/all-NBA level *is the best case scenario* for Haliburton. The kings would literally be cashing in on a gamble in that trade 1-for-1. Simmons' best case scenario was being an NBA superstar. He didn't do that and it looks like he never will. But trading a guy who's 50% there and *could* get to 100% there for a guy that's 100% there is a good move.  The point I'm making is that *it doesn't matter that Simmons is lazy and never became the next LeBron.* That's in the past. The reality now is that his floor is Haliburton's ceiling."
"&gt;the expectations on these guys are so different, no one would care at    all if Haliburton was scoreless in a quarter because we're more    impressed by how he exceeded expectations than how Simmons underachieved    his.  Because Haliburton is a 21 year old rookie and Simmons is a 25 year old first overall pick getting paid 35 million dollars to be the number two option on a contending team.      like, ""damn the expectations of Rudy Gobert and Jalen Smith are so different"", no really??"
Rudy Gobert is unplayable in the playoffs.  Marcus Smart is a high IQ player
Rudy Gobert is a worse shooter but his FT% is better
"Throw in Demar Derozan, Rudy Gobert, and Julius Randle if you want 30 names.  I don't know if you can pick 10 names from that list that you would rather have Simmons over."
In the last 3 seasons AD only scored more than 26 once against Gobert  Embiid has only had one high scoring game vs Rudy  It's really just Jokic it seems like
So how has he escaped criticism while Gobert and Jokic who had the same exact problems were getting hate? Do we agree that It takes 2 to guard a pick and roll and Rudy Gobert was unfairly criticized
I.....dunno know how well they are modeling aging of centers if they have Rudy Gobert as the 9th most valuable player in the NBA over the next 7 yrs.   If your closest comp is DeAndre Jordan that should be sounding alarm bells for aging trajectory.
"I wish people liked watching Rudy Gobert as much as they liked talking about him.    Nobody knows if he's good enough to win a championship but people talk about him like he's fucking incompetent or something, it makes no sense.  Like even just in terms of points he's incredible. Last year he put up 15 a game on 8 shots!  8!   He's literally the most efficient offensive player in NBA history.   That's such an insanely useful skillset to have on the team, to be able to get points without taking the ball away from anybody, even just strictly speaking about scoring."
"i also think lebron &gt; kobe, but stats do not objectively make one player better.  for ex: current rudy gobert has worse stats than ""prime"" drummond, but nobody says drummond is better than gobert"
I would love to have Jrue Holliday or Rudy Gobert. I love Holliday tho so I'd choose him even if Gobert is the smarter choice
"Well it's a good thing they didn't give him the supermax, then.   This conversation seems to have started on a less than smart assumption, for example that Rudy Gobert signed a supermax and has the 5th largest salary in the NBA.   He did not and does not.  Rudy Gobert got a 200 milion dollar contract because NBA players make insane amounts of money now and he signed an extension, not because the Jazz thought he was worth as much as Steph Curry.   The next couple seasons he'll be about 15-20th highest paid player in the league which will decrease over time."
But he has defensive player of the year Rudy Gobert
"He just happens to be the perfect example of a player that you feel like you are forced to keep, but isn't worth the supermax. The top 5 salaries in the NBA are in order: Giannis, Steph, Luka (nothing to say so far), Westbrook (at the time it was signed i don't think many people were against it) and freaking Rudy Gobert.  Is Gobert good? Yeah, but is he 200 million dollars good? Fuck No. Dude averages 13 ppg in the postseason for god's sake."
"We cant know the reasons why superstar stay here or go there for sure, but money Is a factor. We cant know what John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gobert, James Harden or Giannis was gonna do if there wasnt the supermax."
If you can tell me someone better than Rudy Gobert that the Jazz could have gotten with that money - I would agree with you.     You can argue it's an overpay - but I don't think it's an overpay for Utah. They have to pay more than LA would have to for the same player. That's life.
"Probably a top 5 most valuable player during the regular season, in the vicinity of Rudy Gobert."
Such a roundabout way to just talk about how much you don't like Rudy Gobert.
"&gt; If Rudy Gobert was winning the championship every year, a lot of people would have him as MVP.  Doubt."
"&gt;I don’t see you arguing that Rudy Gobert should be winning MVPs, so you can’t be posting this crap without doing that.  Calm down douchey. If Rudy Gobert was winning the championship every year, a lot of people would have him as MVP."
"Imagine calling All nba voting completely useless because someone didn’t put you above someone who literally had the best statistical season in nba history, by a huge fucking margin.  Wilt literally averaged 50.4ppg, 25.7 rpg and shot .505 from the field (second in the nba).  Russell averaged 18.9ppg and 23.6 rpg while shooting .457 from the field.   Oh but Russell had so many blocks!!! So did wilt, wilt was an amazing defender when he was young too. Sure Bill Russell was the better defender, but offence has to come into play as well, where wilt averaged 31.5 ppg more than him. If you subtracted bill Russell’s ppg from Wilts, he would still lead the league in points. That will never happen again in the history of sport where if you subtract the MVP’s points from the league leader in points, he will never be remotely close to leading the league.   Bill Russell played on possibly the greatest era dependent basketball team in history, with some of the greatest players to ever play the game. Wilt did not have this luxury. I don’t see you arguing that Rudy Gobert should be winning MVPs, so you can’t be posting this crap without doing that. Rudy gobert is modern day bill Russell during the regular season."
Pretty short list of 3x+ dpoy players  Ben wallace Dwight Howard Dikembe mutombo Rudy gobert   I’d be pretty surprised if he doesn’t end up first ballot
"Nah, Joker and his son, Rudy Gobert."
&gt;black Rudy Gobert
That's why I said the black Rudy Gobert
"Rudy sets hard screens and rolls extremely hard to the rim that is the entire base of their entire defense. Not to mention, he is arguably the best regular-season defender ever. You're just insulting Gobert with those takes."
"Rudy Gobert doesn't have the mobility, ball handling, passing, leadership, etc. Of Bill Russell lmao"
"Bill Russell would be the black Rudy Gobert if he were in the modern era tbh, but yall ain't ready for that convo"
Gobert tried to do his job. Coach Snyder has more blame than anybody as far as I'm concerned. He made 0 adjustments when Mann was absolutely destroying us from the 3. All of us couch potatoes knew what to do. Put anybody out there that wasn't named Rudy Gobert or Favors at that time.
RUDY GOBERT TOP 3 CENTERS IN THE LEAGUE MF
"For your takes :   Agree, MVP is overrated and is a team accomplishment most of the time but the main problem imo is consistency. Westbrook should have never one MVP if they wanted to be consistent.   Kobe is top 8 all time and behind Duncan. Timmy carried more in 99 and 03 than Kobe ever did on his championship. The only year Kobe had potential to have similar carry potential he lost (2008).   Indeed, 09 and 10 are highly underrated nowadays cz Kobe is retired so people forgot those great runs. Pau deserves more credit though, he was a top 3/4 player every series.   Tim Duncan is underrated not overrated. His individual skillset is highly underrated, for the first 7 years of his career he was a great scorer, arguably a goat type defensive player, and his game was built for the playsoff. Underrated passer and rebounder too. Had one of if not the greatest individual playoff run of all time in 03 and carried in 99 and 07. In 05 he was 1A and Ginobili was 1B. TP got FMVP cz he was a scorer. In 14, he was the best player with TP on the squad but kawhi overperformed in the finals and got the FMVP.   It's more a problem of today era of Basketball where most stars coast cz they don't want to get injured. It's possibly a product of the constant increase of injury rate. Right now, even before covid, players are get injured way more (most likely because the speed is higher than ever and bodies are scientifically pushed to the limit) and superstars try to avoid that. Not only Kobe but every old stars were tryharding all season.   2nd 3 peat team was easily a super team and Rodman could have won FMVP in 1996.   Yes but bird and Magic super teams clashed so it kinds of evens out. LeBron clashed with a super team too in golden state. Indeed most goat type players played at one point in a super team. Jordan last dance, wilt Lakers, Russell Celtics, Magic showtime, Bird Celtics, LeBron return to Cavs, Kobe Shaq.   Not calling Kobe Shaq a super team is acceptable but creates lots of question about other perceived super teams : was LeBron Cavs a super team ? Was Kevin Love good enough to be called a star (he averaged 10 PTS in the finals which is less than ariza in 09). Was Showtime Lakers really a super team in 88? KAJ was 40 and averaging 14 PTS. There is far less super teams in NBA history of you count like that. Stars like Bosh, Love, old KAJ, old Pippen/Rodman are very close to role splayers at some points. In the end I think the super team idea is overrated, and that every player needs significant amount of help to win a championship cz it's a team sport. I consider Shaq in the first 3 peat Lakers a more valuable player than Kyrie and KLove combined in 16 for example.   Yes KAJ got robbed.   I dunno about the great big of the 90s but the 10s definitely. Thurmond would destroy most current big men and would be a better Rudy Gobert."
Kobe is underrated  Rudy gobert is underrated  One piece is the greatest manga of all time
Rudy Gobert is overrated
He'd be a fusion of prime Draymond Green and Rudy Gobert but on steroids and way more athletic.
He’d be short Rudy Gobert
"1. Rudy Gobert will hit 10+ 3-pointers this upcoming season. Laugh all you want, but mark my words. 2. Giannis will finish his career a top-5 player of all time."
"Watching all the reddit stat nerds crap on Mitchell to prop up Gobert all season was honestly the most frustrating shit ever. Once playoffs rolled around and Spida started routinely dropping 30 bombs on a bum ankle and Rudy got cooked by Terance Mann(lmfao) and Reggie Jackson in game 6 they all shut the hell up for a day or two which was nice.  Donovan Mitchell is the best player on the Utah Jazz, end of story."
"Ian Mahimini, Joakhim Noah, and Timothey Mosgov got crazy deals at the time. The cap was expected to skyrocket. It's not unreasonable to assume that he thought he was worth somewhere between Mahimini and Rudy Gobert.       But then this guy spent the next two years taking the vet minimum which was highly unusual for a player of his caliber. He could have signed with a potential contender like Houston or LAC."
"I did watch the matches.  What would happen is because of the Jazz's defense deficiency on the perimeter gobert was forced to give more space to Mann in order to be able to help when his teammates inevitably got passed by the clippers offense, clippers would wait for gobert to start moving towards the paint and then immediately pass to Terrence Mann for the catch and shoot 3. The jazz lost to their inability to be able to switch and couldnt rely on only rudy to cover the difference defensively.  I'm not saying he played perfectly, but saying that they lost because of Gobert's lack of versatility rather than the Jazz's roster not being constructed to play against switching offenses and simply hoping that gobert would be able to carry all of the weight defensively which is just impossible.    Tl;Dr You cant expect 1 player to guard an entire team simultaneously no matter how good at defense they are in the modern NBA"
"OP, I agree that Gobert gets way too much blame for the Jazz defensive breakdown in Game 6. He made the right help play every time Utah's guards got blown by, and it's not his fault that his teammates failed to rotate to his man. Gobert's postseason defensive struggles are completely overblown by people who saw Steph cross him up in 2017. Rudy is a great playoff defender.  That being said, Gobert does not get nearly enough blame for how his offensive limitations cost the Jazz in that game. He has no post moves or face-up game. He can't make a jumper or hit his free throws. He's a bad passer. The only thing he can do on offense is catch the ball and dunk.  This doesn't get talked about enough. When the Clippers went small, Gobert's complete lack of offensive skill made it impossible for him to punish them on the offensive end. Rudy has no excuse for not being able to score on Terrance Mann and Marcus Morris. If Gobert could do anything on offense besides finish plays in the restricted area that his teammates create for him, he would have been able to play the Clippers' small lineup off the court. That he couldn't do that is pretty damning. I think his offensive limitations are the biggest reason why the Jazz won't win a title with him as one of their two best players."
"How many possessions did Gobert get down low on mismatches? Without Conley playing, no one ever gets Rudy the ball. The collapse is on Snyder, our wing defenders and our lack of playmaking without Conley imo."
"[For real can't believe anyone here taking KAT](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1383933361236873216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1383933361236873216%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthejnotes.com%2F2021%2F04%2F19%2Futah-jazz-rudy-gobert-defensive-impact%2F)  Jazz go from [3rd best defense] (https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/defense/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1) to [worst defense in the league](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/jazz-defensive-rating-without-gobert-2021) when he is off the court.  People clown on him OD, man deserves so much more respect"
&gt;Timberwolves fans always use Embiid injury concerns and missing games argument but ignore it when talking about KAT   Sorry that we couldn't predict Rudy Gobert pushing KAT and him contracting a deadly virus.
He never was. Every time I see a thread like this I remind myself how the best thing Rudy could do to improve his perceived value would be to miss an extended period of time to injury. Everyone’s giving KAT the excuse of poor teammates but we were god awful the last time Rudy got hurt. Even last year with the great regular seasons we had our net rating was -2.5 with Gobert not on the floor.
People legitimately putting Rudy Gobert in these debates.   Spreadsheet nerds are unbeatable.
"Rudy gets as much heat as he does because he's making 205 million dollars.  He took 6 total shots and got torched by Terrance Mann who went against Gobert quite a few times straight up in the interior.  Gobert being underwhelming in the playoffs is not new to G6 either. The reality is being a big man defensive anchor is great in the regular season but is clearly exploitable in the playoffs when he can't do much on his own on the offensive end to punish the smaller lineups.  You're not wrong about the perimeter D and Gobert being put in a tough spot, but this is a taste of what you get sometimes when giving max contracts to elite role players.  Ask me how I feel about Ben Simmons scoring 5pts and passing up dunks/layups against the worst defender in the league. If Gobert could punish smaller lineups, we wouldn't be having this discussion."
Except they will see Rudy Gobert and Myles Turner sticking to Anthony Davis and actually understand the context of LeBron scoring.
"For offense, rim-running was all he was projected to be able to do out the gate it seems. He was considered a solid-good athlete with great length and height. His jumpshot also showed potential and quite a few people could've envisioned him adding a faceup midrange game or catch+shoot 3.   Adding his offensive potential with what scouts saw as immediate defensive impact had people projecting he could become Rudy Gobert (pre-DPOY selection but 1st Team All-D [2017]) with some semblance of a jumpshot and offensive game.  He was definitely not seen to be Hibbert at best and to say that feels like revisionist history (people misremember all the time, I could've sworn Tony Wroten was a god at one point).

I like the idea of Moses Brown evolving into 3 different pokemons  JaVale McGee (offense form)  Rudy Gobert (defense form)  DeAndre Jordan (rebound form)
Rudy Gobert sent you guys packing once before too.
"I would go  JaVale McGee, Mitchell Robinson , Rudy Gobert"
"True, didn't mean to infer it was, but I mean he still has to play both ends, and at least Rudy can throw a screen, and since he's playing Center he's not clogging the paint like Simmons is. I also really think that Gobert is underrated."
This is what happens when Rudy Gobert is your centre
A team giving Rudy Gobert max money will never sniff a championship.
"I think Philly would immediately be better swapping a permitter player for Simmons. Philly has such an unbalanced roster. They are trying to be contenders with Seth Curry as their best permitter creator. That's nowhere near good enough to challenge for a title no matter how good Embiid is. They just flat out don't have anywhere near enough playmaking and shot creation to win a playoff series vs a good team. There is no team that has won playing this way since the Hakeem Rockets when illegal defence rules still existed.  Maybe Simmons for Russell or someone of that ilk isn't equal value in a vacuum depending on what you think of Simmons, but that doesn't matter. You almost never get equal value and Philly has had a giant hole in their roster since Buttler left. After whiffing on Lowry for the second time Simmons is the only vehicle to fill it. They can hold out for the big fish, but it's an incredibly dangerous game.     Simmons's value isn't going to get higher in my opinion. Another year of putting up 15/7 with a Rudy Gobert shot chart isn't going to change how anyone values Simmons. And, if Dame or Beal don't become available or Simmons doesn't draw the picks and assets Washington and Portland want they are going to be wasting another year of Embiid's prime with a deeply flawed roster that I think has no chance to contend."
Roy Hibbert completely outplayed Chris Bosh on both ends in 2013. Rudy Gobert has never performed remotely close to that in the playoffs. Peak Hibbert is better than Rudy.
Bismack Biyombo  Clint Capela  Rudy Gobert
Daniel Gafford  Mitchell Robinson  Rudy Gobert
"Moses Brown, JaVale McGee, Rudy Gobert"
"We swept em in the regular season, cp3 has historically cooked Rudy gobert."
"The Bucks play drop center defense. It also has gotten blamed when they lose in the playoffs. There’s nuance to it though, like if the Bucks are facing a team playing Kevin Durant and Jeff Green for 40+ of their center minutes, you really need to have 5s with lateral speed for switches, or double down on the difference between playstyles and utilize your roll man’s size advantage heavily on offense.  Rudy Gobert is elite at finishing roll man plays in the NBA. Actually the Olympic finals this year was literally a team playing small ball centers including Durant vs Gobert and if Gobert hit 90% of free throws (he was earning a hell of a lot of them) his team would’ve won the game. The balancing act is the frequency and efficiency of each team’s opposite, optimal play— ball screens for jump shots by the small team, screen and rolls for roll man finishes by the big team.   It’s still just tempting to say that if an opposing team is killing your drop center defense to the tune of 130 offensive rating, the defensive style is nearing being unplayable. I’m tempted to say the Jazz might be getting a bit unlucky. But there’s much more to the equation than just 2 play types. People just rationalize around the results (most later series are close, and at that point everything from FT% to extra possessions is arguably changing the series). “The team that lost was worse” is the truest thing you can say, but also the only thing you can say with less refinement than comparing broad, conceptual styles."
"[Per Pearson's follow up tweet](https://twitter.com/McCadeP8/status/1430997318262681600), it's only happened 4 times: 1984 Jazz, 2020 Jazz, 2021 Blazers and 2021 Jazz  &gt; 1984 WCSF, Jazz were a 123.4 against the Suns. AD averaged 33  &gt; 2021 Blazers vs. Nuggets from this year.  Is that additional context not compelling enough? I feel you on ORtg going up, but it's the defensive component that shocked me. The Blazers achieving it isn't shocking b/c we knew that had a below average defense all of the regular season. But w/the Jazz having such elite regular season defenses in '20 and in '21, and then having historically terrible playoff defenses in those 2 series is interesting imo.  I think it 1.) highlights how great Gobert is on his own for a great defense(granted his impact decreases in the playoffs) and 2.) puts a lot of pressure this year on Lindsey and Snyder to figure out how to adapt in the playoffs and figure it out by trying out different things in the regular season.   Idk if you saw this above but here's more context from u/Agnk1765342. Imo this gives even more reason why I think this factoid is interesting   &gt;2021 playoffs with Gobert on the floor: 118 drating  &gt; 2021 playoffs without Gobert on the floor: 130 drating  &gt; It’s really that all our guys are so used to Gobert covering their mistakes that they have terrible habits and aren’t able to stay in front of their man. It’s a lot more about Quinn and the guys on the perimeter than Rudy. If Rudy wanted whoever he was guarding on the clips to score 0 points that game, they would’ve, but he has to guard multiple people simultaneously for us to defend well. I’m pretty sure the drating in the clips series without Rudy was closer to 140 anyways."

"Pretty dumb take imo, 29 ppg on 27 shooting possessions is fine when you are the entire offense. Now if he does that with lebron and AD, I agree that would be a problem. I just think using Rudy Gobert as an example against Russ is dumb because historically he dominates Rudy and is usually the example player that comes up when someone tries to argue against Rudy’s DPOY awards. There were games during the regular season where jazz would actually sit Gobert when playing against Westbrook and I don’t ever recall the vice versa being true"
Think of Hibbert as a way less talented version of Rudy Gobert.. it was a different time in the NBA and less skilled big men could get a job just by being big and being good at stopping guys. Guys like Al Jefferson were still focal points of the offense back then (I think he hadn’t retired yet)
"https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/russell-westbrook-vs-rudy-gobert-playoffs-head-to-head   I mean I’m just saying if that’s Russ being uncomfortable, I’ll gladly take it."
"https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/russell-westbrook-vs-rudy-gobert-career-head-to-head  Except Russ kinda plays his best against Rudy so not sure why that’s a super comfortable matchup, especially last year."
"Rudy Gobert is a deserving 3 time winner. Duncan had the misfortune of playing the same time as guys like Ben Wallace, Ron Artest, and Dwight Howard. 07 is the one year he should have won and even then, it wasn't THAT big of a mistake. Camby was a legit great defender as well."
Yeah when Rudy Fucking Gobert wins it 3 times it's a BS award
"I was really happy about the Lakers trading for Russ in the event we face off in the playoffs. That’s a super comfortable matchup for Rudy, Brodie’s worst chucking tendencies come out every time he plays Gobert, and like you said I’m not worried about AD shooting from 3."
Anything regarding Rudy Gobert  Players now wouldn't have made it in the 80s-90s (do oldheads think that the NBA would be empty or something or that the best players in the world wouldn't be able to adapt?)  LeBum  Mickey mouse ring (I'm not even a huge fan of LBJ and it was a defintly a unique situation that caused for a different outcome then if the season continued normally but everyone had the same conditions so at the end of the day the winner was still the winner)  Luka will be a top 5 player of all time (can you tell me next weeks lottery numbers too?)  Jokic overated  Trae is a top 10 player  X team only won because of X excuse
"The straw that broke the camel’s back to initiate the nationwide lockdowns of the United States was Rudy Gobert.  He probably is an accidental hero that saved a lot of lives early on when things were starting to escalate out of control and we had no idea wtf we were dealing with or how to treat it yet.  Someone else would have been that unintentional hero within a day or two, but it was Rudy Gobert for whatever reason."
"I get where you’re coming from,  but this would be a god awful stat. Defenses funnel players into their best defenders and hide their worst defenders on their opponents worst offensive players. Rudy Gobert challenged the most shots in the league last year- this stat would punish him for that. Whereas somebody like Kyrie or Dame that typically gets hid on opponents worst players would come out looking like a superstar defender"
"Mitchell, Gobert, Conley, Bogdanovic, Clarkson.  So best we’d have available is Royce O’Neale, Joe Ingles, and Rudy Gay."
Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert
Rudy “The Stifle Tower” Gobert!!!
Rudy Gobert
"Rudy Gobert. 3 DPOYs in 4 years, dominates on defense unlike anyone in the league, and let’s be real, he’s not *that* bad at offense, he's average but not a liability."
"FG% is a decent indication of how certain games went for certain players but overall it’s just not that useful at all in a broad scope. Guys like deandre Jordan and rudy gobert lead the league in the stat every year, and guys like harden look pedestrian because of FG% because of 3 point volume."
Rudy Gobert should be next. Dominates the defensive end as well as any player dominates the offensive end
Let's get Rudy Gobert in this thing
Rudy Gobert.
"In 2021, there are three positions: guard wing big. A perfect example of each would be like Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, and Rudy Gobert."
"Rudy Gobert had a few too, I believe he actually made all NBA, dpoy but not all star at least once"
Rudy gobert should be on the poll
yup here you go  PG: Point Vucevic  SG: Zach LaVine  SF: Lonzo Ball  PF: PWill  C: Rudy Gobert  DeRozan 6th man
Actual Rudy Gilbert &gt;&gt;&gt; this sub’s interpretation of Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert&gt; Mitchell
Disagree with the first one and disagree with the whole notion that certain players wouldn’t “succeed” in the modern NBA. If Rudy Gobert can be a star level player Bill Russell certainly can lol  I think Duncan is better but W Drob is underrated af. People just see his playoff woes but he wasn’t built around correctly and he was insane on both ends  I think Wade &gt; Harden due to playoffs and defense but there’s a case for the other
Rudy Gobert &gt; Russell Westbrook
"&gt;Don’t bother responding. Sometimes it’s okay to just eat the downvotes  Yeah, you're right. Sometimes, you gotta reflect and realize that you're talking to literal 12 year old kids on this reddit, so you shouldn't take some dumb opinions so seriously.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The misunderstood cases of rudy gobert and draymond green to a certain extent is so sad but it is what it is.  Pretty much."
Don’t bother responding. Sometimes it’s okay to just eat the downvotes. They are not ready. Maybe in a few years or when the average NBA fan understands basketball beyond typical 1v1 comparisons. The misunderstood cases of rudy gobert and draymond green to a certain extent is so sad but it is what it is.
Spida just get the hell outta there. No team is ever making the finals paying Rudy Gobert the max.
"It's pitiful that I think Rudy Gobert sets great screens to creates offense for himself and his team? I don't get why you think that's pitiful.   And the Jazz don't pay Rudy to back down his defenders, or really to score at all. Just like the Warriors don't pay Steph Curry to play lockdown defense, and the Sixers don't pay Ben Simmons to hit jumpshots.   And I don't care about the varying reasons stars disrespect him (anyone, please feel free to connect LeBron's logic of how what teams he played on NBA Jam as a kid connect to Rudy Gobert's basketball skill), but the fact that they talk about him at all is testament to the fact that he's highly-skilled at several things in the league, even if it isn't the skills that get celebrated by Lakers fans like you."
Up 25 in game 6 and choked a lead because Terrance man went god mode. They don’t deserve anything more than a 2nd round exit  Not to mention suns swept them in the regular season and Chris Paul has historically dominated Rudy gobert. I don’t see any way they get past suns/bucks and obviously they lost to clipps
Rudy Gobert is literally Giannis’s son.
"Rudy would have the exact problems against the Bucks he does anyone else. Lopez spends a shitload of time out at the 3, so unless Gobert was guarding Giannis, he wouldn’t be nearly as effective as he is in the regular season"
Except Giannis dunking on Rudy Gobert is a tradition that already started in the summerleague of Gobert's rookie season
"Hated team all the way. Not that the loved team is bad by any means, but the hated team has Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Paul George. I’m not sure they would ever miss a bucket, as basically the only two defenders on the loved team are Middleton and Giannis.  On top of that, you have Rudy Gobert and KD protecting the rim, and you have two really good defenders(so long as they are putting in the effort) in James Harden and Paul George, and a guy who doesn’t have the size to be effect, but is at least going to put in the effort in Kyrie.  Aside from that, switch out Middleton for Klay Thompson. I think this sub doesn’t give Middleton the credit he deserves, but this sub *loves* Klay Thompson.  Also, Westbrook and Lebron have to be on the hated team over Gobert and PG. I don’t think anyone truly hates either Gobert or George.  Even if you make those changes, I’m still taking the hated team."
"He had a nice fadeaway, he wasn't like Rudy gobert"
"The list:  1). Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  2). Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  3). LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  4). Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  5).

time to add this to the pile of videos of Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons making 3's during offseason practice
"Exactly what the other poster was getting at. Rudy Gobert is the perfect stat boi player; the fact that he may go down as perhaps the most decorated defender in NBA history is an abomination.   Putting him anywhere near KG, Tim Duncan, Ben Wallace, Rodman, and Russell, legends who have led their teams to titles is absurd. A player who is the epitome of regular season min-maxing that becomes useless in the 2nd round of the playoffs is only in this discussion because of people’s obsession with stats."
People already try to compare Rudy fucking Gobert to Big Ben.

"Duncan was an absolute master of timing and positioning. IMO he'd be the souped up version of Rudy Gobert in the modern era, especially if he had never gotten injured"
"Hopefully. Tobias i think would be a good goal for BI to hit.   Simmons has a higher ceiling than all three for sure if he learns to shoot in games instead of summer workout videos.   But that's sort of the argument from above. We can discuss realistic trades of fair value between those three guys.   With AD, man, we would have to compare almost similar value to maybe Giannas or KD? Even Rudy Gobert would be a downgrade. And supermax players aren't ever available. Yet."
He still is an AllNBA player ans a AllDefense player. What would you give for Rudy Gobert? A pick and Malcom Brogdon? Of course not.
"Rebound and block stats can be extremely misleading.   Not only was Jordan often times the only big man on the court, the nets also gave up like the 4th most fga per game. He also played almost exclusively at or around the rim because his lack of speed was easy to take advantage of. All of this inevitably leads to more rebounds and blocks. A much more telling stat is the nets defensive rating when he played real minutes vs when he sat. Our defense went from horribly bad to actually pretty good.   Basically yes, he was terrible at guarding the pick and roll (which pretty much every team bases their offense around) and lacked the strength to guard competent offensive big men, which is a problem when he also lacked the speed required to guard better centers who are a threat from beyond 10 feet.   Basically a black hole on defense. All the other players had to try and compensate leading to a ton of open looks from deep / easy layups.   This word gets used a ton, but he truly is washed. When a player makes Jeff Green and Blake Griffen look like Rudy Gobert at the center position defensively, there’s a problem."
rudy gobert doesnt play offense and carries his team(in the regular season)
Yes they clowned a lot of people but even still Rudy made our defense hold them to below their averages while playing Rubio and Favors choked our offense and that's why we lost. KAT played awful D while only scoring 15PPG. Gobert nearly had that much. KAT just didn't show up like he was supposed to
Rudy Gobert
Most teams got 30 million in players they don’t want to get a Paul George or Jimmy butler or Rudy gobert
I’d pick KAT over these guys if I’m building a team from scratch.  - Klay post injury.  - Paul George - Jimmy Butler - Jamal Murray - Rudy Gobert - Bradley Beal - Chris Paul - Kylie Irving
"The last time Rudy was hurt we were just as bad as the wolves without KAT. It’s pretty clear that Gobert affects winning a lot more than Towns. All KAT really has going for him is stats, but his advanced stats aren’t even close to Rudy’s."
We really gonna start using win shares?   Because Rudy Gobert has a higher offensive winshares than Bill Russell.
He is not as good as the following players Lebron  Kd  Giannis  Kawhi  Luka  Paul George  Steph  Dame  Klay  Embiid  Jimmy butler   Donovan Mitchell  Nikola jokic  Jamal Murray  Tatum  Rudy gobert  Bradley beal  Trae young  Kyrie Irving  James Harden   Anthony Davis  Devin Booker   Chris paul  So I put him around the top 25ish
"HARDDDD disagree  lebron, kd, giannis, kawhi, steph, james harden, jokic, embiid, ad, luka, dame time, paul george, chris paul, jimmy butler rudy gobert, tatum, booker, bam bam, kyrie irving, khris middleton are my personal top 20, with very loose ordering before anyone flames me.  can you really make a case that kat is actually better or has more actual realized impact for the team he plays for than any of those guys? I cannot, I really dont think hes underrated by a long shot. Hes properly rated"
"He's absolutely a star, he just isn't a superstar. He's in that Jaylen Brown/Devin Booker/Rudy Gobert/Khris Middleton/Donovan Mitchell"
Career 2.3 blocks per game. Rudy Gobert won DPOY this year and averages 2.2 per game. Stop it.
"I would doubt it. I think the spirit of the DPOY of the year award has become who is the most impactful defender. By no means is that a bad lens to view who should win the award, but it definitely presents an uphill battle for a guards' case.   It would have to be a guard with the quickness and tenacity to be a devastating one on one defender, with enough size and length to be versatile enough to guard anyone on the floor. Even then, that's probably not enough to anchor a great team defense by itself, so you would need to surround them with other very capable defenders. Not impossible, but when there are guys like Rudy Gobert who can more or less carry any 4 guys into being a great defense, it's tough"
The jazz led the NBA in 3 point shooting with their drive and kick offense. Take Donovan out of that and their offense tanks because you don’t have to respect his ability to drive and finish at the rim. And if you watched the playoffs this year you’d know that Rudy Goberts defense can be schemed against. Meanwhile Donovans offense was unplayable the whole playoffs.   If you seriously think Rudy Gobert is more valuable to the jazz than Spida I don’t know what to tell you.
"Nah, we need as much shooting as we can around Rudy. We tried putting a non-shooter in Favors next to Gobert for years and it just didn’t work. The whole point of our offensive system is there’s nobody you can help off of except Rudy, but he’s always gonna be setting a screen or threatening the rim. I’m not interested personally."
Yeah people have used it for Rudy Gobert cus when he rim runs it sorta sucks in the defense into the paint and really opens corners for 3pr
Rudy Gobert. Add in a 16 foot jumper and he's a monster.

"Rudy Gobert is overrated in every area except how many fouls he gets away with. I'd be much more willing to give him props if he was more crafty about it, but every time I watch the homie play it looks like the refs are assuming he's playing clean D. It's true of pretty much every talented defender, but he's not pushing a lot of small limits to force the refs to let him play like some greats. Just gets some 2020-Playoff-Lakers-level no calls when he's blatantly fouling. I really like watching the Jazz, especially last year, but that dude kinda kills it for me  Edit: Still if he was getting away with that shit and he was playing for my team, I'd probably be fan. Dude is still good, just overrated"
I just hate Rudy Gobert and Chris Paul
I was about to argue that Ben Wallace deserves it based off multiple DPOY awards but then that means Rudy Gobert should make it as well as Dwight Howard..
"lmaoooo i can picture it so vividly lol. It's so true though, if Pierce was with TNT, Shaq chuck EJ and Kenny would just roast the shit out of him live on air the next day. They'd never let him hear the end of it but at the end of the day they're just gonna get a laugh out of it, wouldn't be a huge deal. No huge scandal, no drama, just another funny TNT story that'll show up in the next documentary. They'd all laugh and then go on to shitting on rudy gobert or whatever random shit they're talking about that day lol"
"You literally even agree that defensive scores and offensive scores don't carry equal weight because you said comparing top defensive players to top offensive players was unfair lol.   Rudy Gobert being a +7.9 on defense and a -0.1 on offense isn't close to as valuable as Harden being a +7.2 on offense and a -1.6 on defense or Luka being a +6.6 on offense and a -0.8 on defense.  I am consistent across the board that Guard defense doesnt matter, you're the one saying it doesn't matter for all the guys that are negative but not as negative ad Trae, and that the line is only once you're as bad as Trae. You called Luka an MVP candidate on the other thread while he's a negative on defense."
"Russell Westbrook, RJ Barrett, Reggie Bullock, Rui Hachimura, Rudy Gobert"
"So would you say the same thing about someone like Rudy Gobert or Zach LaVine? Gobert's game is basically just rim running, setting screens and defense. LaVine's game is basically just 3 level scoring."
Rudy Gobert is the DPOY
Rudy Gobert against a small lineup
"Far from stupid, my friend. This is no less plausible than the frozen envelope theory. I've presented a real-world example of a father forcing a team to pass on a player, and Luka had far more leverage than Eli--he could simply return to the Euroleague. But this father saw how Eli was vilified for thinking he was too good for the Chargers and made sure to keep it private; after all, Luka is a marketing wet dream.  Him supposedly disliking Luka's father is just pure conjecture, another conspiracy theory.  You really think it's not a thought worth entertaining? Then you know nothing of Eastern Europe. I do. My family's from there. Again, in the not-so-recent past, these were all brothers under the Soviet heel. In fact, the best basketball documentary made except for Hoop Dreams is about just that and features Vlade.  Perhaps there's a business opportunity for Vlade tied up in it; perhaps organized crime is involved in some way. Vlade's from a different culture, my man.  Vlade has shown no indication that he's overly aspirational when it comes to an NBA front office career. He has many other business and humanitarian activities that are probably more rewarding than working for the inept Kings--for all we know, he was already planning on leaving (we all know the owner is shit) and decided to do Luka a solid on the way out.  Someone said the Kings would be better with Luka than the Mavs are. I'm not going to debate that. Nothing about on the court play. This isn't about that. There's no better situation for Luka than going to Dirk's team that already has established ties in Europe--the Kings wouldn't have done all the Mavs have done with Luka this summer over there.  Obviously I have no proof. It's the off-season, and fun to speculate. I've given several reasons that make the thought worth entertaining, if just for the hell of it. Do you have anything worth saying to dispute it that isn't spurious insults or evidence of ignorance of the Cold-War history of that part of Europe? You could ridicule that bond if I suggested he was helping Rudy Gobert, but that Europe is not this Europe."
"One or two players change an entire perspective of an organization. For example if Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell weren't so good, I am sure people would be saying the Utah Jazz are bad at developing and/or drafting players after they had Kanter, Trey Burke, Trey Lyles etc for a while. If the Kings drafted Luka, him along with Fox would have change the entire perspective of the Kings. The Spurs have been so good for so long so they get a lot of leeway because they don't get high round picks so we really don't know and they hit it big with Kawhi. If Spurs had the 4th or 5th pick in the 2013 draft for example, I wonder who they would have picked and if that player would have turned out to be a game changer."
"Gobert is the better regular season player by a huge margin.  I'd take Mitchell in most playoffs match ups. With that being said I think it's hilarious that people put the Clippers series loss on Gobert, while what actually killed their defense is that their entire scheme is basically ""hey Rudy we all suck on defense can you clean that up ?"""
MVP: Kevin Durant  DPOY: Rudy Gobert  MIP: Jaren Jackson Jr  6MOTY: Lou Williams  ROTY: Jalen Green
"You would undoubtedly have seen that already imo if LaVine was in Utah in Mitchell’s place. Playing next to some legitimate NBA point guards (Rubio, Conley) and shooters over the years on a team with a perennial DPOY candidate center, I’m extremely confident that an alpha scorer as efficient as Zach would consistently have that team in the playoffs. I’m hesitant to say he would “lead” them to the playoffs because I’m hesitant to say Mitchell “leads” Utah to the playoffs. He’s undoubtedly their lead man offensively but Rudy Gobert is the guy who drastically raises the floor of the team and makes them as a playoff lock.   I’d like to see Donovan Mitchell lead Lauri Markkanen, Wendell Carter Jr, and Denzel Valentine to the playoffs."
"&gt;or just completely shit the bed like he did vs Houston a couple of years back  Lmao, it was his sophomore year and he was the only actual scoring threat as a significant underdog to the Rockets.   It was Mitch, Ricky Rubio, Derrick Favors, Jae Crowder, Rudy Gobert, Royce O'Neale, and Joe Ingles as the guys that played significant minutes."
Does Reddit still think Rudy “12/9 while random role player drops 30 on his head” Gobert is better than a guy who averaged damn near 40 a game over the last two playoffs?
"Rudy Gobert is a three time DPOY which puts him at the ranks of Mutombo, Wallace, and Dwight Howard.  He broke multiple records for defensive impact this season alone.  The Atlantic even mentioned he should have been the unanimous DPOY this year.  [He has the best defensive raptor and prevented the most points per 100 possessions in history](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/).  He never even got exposed by James Harden in the playoffs the Jazz's perimeter defenders forcing him to respond to James Harden's layups/tear drops.  Even then he still had the most defensive impact in that series too.  You're referring to the same issues that were exposed during the clippers game.  [This reddit thread explains it well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o3mtbo/blaming_gobert_for_not_having_the_ability_to_be/)  All the people you listed were amazing big mans however you do not need to discredit  Gobert as well.  You act like the 3/4 big men given above weren't all in defensive player of the year contention in the past 3 years."
"AD, Joel and Jokic lol. One of those guys is an elite rim protector. The other is just good. And the last isn’t at all lol.   Gobert would be exposed by Jordan the exact same way the Rockets with Harden and CP3 exposed him. Jesus Christ. You’re comparing Rudy to the likes of Hakeem, Robinson, Shaq, Duncan, Mutombo, Ewing. All elite defenders. Most recognized as the best of all time.   Some of y’all did not see the truly elite big men &amp; y’all just announcing that shit to the whole world."
The Rudy Gobert effect
Baguette Biyombo aka Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert
"Damn right he's not, the real Agent Zero retired years ago.   (To answer OP's question, definitely the former. It's a freakin' pandemic; if it wasn't Gobert, someone else would have gotten it in very short order. That season was always going to be suspended. Now, was he kind of a tool about the safety protocols? Yeah, sure, but tons of people weren't taking COVID seriously at that point. And again, if it wasn't Rudy Gobert, it was probably only a matter of days until it was someone else. Just happened to be him.)"
Hot take: He won't be remembered  And I like Rudy Gobert
"Well if Rudy Gobert directly contributed to the spread of covid and its misinformation, than yeah. But I think Gobert gets a pass on the situation, as it was relatively early in the pandemic and nobody truly understood the severity of it."
"Rudy gobert unironically saved lives by being a moron.  He got all major sports leagues shut down when they should’ve been, instead of 3-4 days later.  Of course he didn’t mean to and he’s not some hero, but ultimately it was actually a very good thing he was being a moron lol.  Either way I don’t think it affects his legacy.  He’ll go down with a historic number of DPOYs (likely at least 4), I don’t think anyone will focus on him being an idiot at the beginning of a pandemic.  We didn’t know how bad it was then, hard to place too much blame.  Hell, there are still people who don’t take it seriously after millions dead."
They’re not gonna remember Rudy Gobert touching microphones tho
Somehow I think people will remember the hundreds of thousands of deaths / suffering when remembering covid before Rudy Gobert touching microphones…
"He’s gonna be remembered as the old, starting center  on the Lakers that wins a title in 2027 with whichever top 3 talent they have at the time. He’s going to be a good defender still, not an all star and laker fans will be like “wow, imagine if we had PRIME Rudy Gobert beside RJ Barrett, we’d 5peat!!”"
"I don't disagree with the general take of this post, in that the lack of shooting plays into the jazz's favor (o do see Russ taking a personal challenge to score on Rudy at the rim ... Which plays to Rudy's strengths) but man, I'm getting tired of the jazz hype every year. Donovan's a stud but committing to Gobert seriously limits their ceiling bc dude can't guard anyone out on perimeter.   Utah's stubborn commitment to play him requires drop coverage and while that works in the regular season against the meh teams, most good teams in the playoffs (and for sure by the 2nd round) have at least one guy who can take Gobert in those one on one's beyond three point land (easy stepbacks), not to mention if they have a legit midrange shooter who has even more open looks off screens that Rudy backs off of (like kd and cp3).  I admit, losing Conley hurt this year, but I don't know it's enough to assume him coming back is enough to get out of the second round. The jazz are still going to choose to play Rudy in the clutch regsrdless.  Honest question, can the jazz best the nuggets this year?? Jokic lights up Rudy ... How about the suns who have two legit midrange killers? The clippers again? I uno. I guess the OP is talking about the Lakers but I don't know they far enough in the playoffs for us to see."
Do you really think Wayne Ellington and Malik Monk will be playing starter minutes and attacking Rudy Gobert at the rim in the playoffs?
"Laker fans are blasting you but you're dead right. This Lakers team is seriously short on three point shooting, and, as you said, the Jazz's weakness is stopping outside shooting. Then there's the issue of playoff Russ, who matches up extremely poorly against Gobert, as we saw in his Thunder days. Sure, Lebron and AD will get theirs, but can someone else step if the Jazz slow down and tire those guys out? Furthermore, the Lakers weren't exactly a great offensive team last year, even in the regular season. To fix that, they add a low-efficiency ball dominant guy in Russ, a bench spark plug in Kendrick Nunn, and . . .? The Jazz, meanwhile, are a great offensive team who play fast and like to put up (and make) threes. Can the Lakers keep up with the Jazz's scoring pace when Nunn, Malik Monk, and Carmelo Anthony are their reliable bench offense? And, yes, the Lakers were a phenomenal defensive team last year in spite of their offensive limitations, but they've regressed in that area too. Outside of Bron/AD, who are their other plus defenders? Dwight Howard, Kent Bazemore, and Trevor Ariza? Are we expecting those guys to really slow down an extremely well-regimented Jazz offense that has multiple guys who can score in Conley/Mitchell/Bogi, a high-percentage lob threat in Rudy, and multiple elite shooters? And that's before factoring in Mitchell's continued offensive growth (26 ppg last year in spite of a slow start) and consistent performance in the playoffs- he's already played 33 playoff games, and is averaging 29/4/5.5.   People are underrating the Jazz because they're ""chokers."" Reality is, that Clippers team is still a damn good team. And the same misconception led people to doubt the Bucks and the Raptors."
"Dirk was still a work in progress in the post. Don Nelson knew Dirk didn't do well against athletic, physical guys, and so that's what Don Nelson threw at him. Don forced Avery Johnson to make adjustments to which Avery couldn't make due to the construct of the team and still being a young coach. On the other side of the ball the Warriors ran the Mavs into the ground. Eric Dampier was at best the dollar store version of Rudy Gobert so he got benched. With no Dampier in the middle, the Warriors pretty much drove it to the paint with ease and then kicked out for open 3s when the Mavs tried to pack the paint. It was a terrible matchup and Dirks weaknesses were exposed by Don Nelson. It's what led to Dirk mastering and spamming the one legged fadeaway later in his career."
"&gt; Karl Malone had a higher % of his shots assisted and he was a pretty damn good player. That stat doesn’t really mean anything.  Karl Malone averaged 25ppg for his career and their entire system was revolved around Stockton feeding Malone.  If you're suggesting that Gobert could do the same because he had a high fg% while making 5 shots in a playoff game, that would just be insane.  &gt; Rudy shot 73% from the field against the clippers.  He made 5 field goals. This path you're on about fg% is so misleading it's crazy."
Fox yammed one where freaking *Rudy Gobert* made a business decision instead of trying to protect the rim. He isn't afraid of anyone.
DeMar DeFuckingRozan makes players in today’s game look stupid. Jordan would be the best player in the game today or 2 at WORST depending on who you talk to. If we’re going to take away the credibility of certain players due to the era they were forced to play in and reward the players of today I guess Rudy Gobert is now top 10 all time
"Is that an advanced metric? According to that logic, Jrue holiday, Rudy Gobert, and Ben Simmons are all shitty defenders as well. You might be mentally challenged my guy. 9 year olds know nothing about ball these days LMAO"
"&gt;Doesn't matter no excuse for losing to an 8th seed  You're speaking in absolutes like a 1 seed is **never*"" supposed to lose to an 8th seed. They're all professional players on these teams. Seeding doesn't objectively tell you that a team is bad. Lastly, matchups **do** matter. Regardless of the seeds.  Last year Rudy Gobert was unplayable versus the Clippers but he was playable versus the Grizzlies tho. The Jazz were the higher seed against the Clippers, right? Again, if you watch that series, Dallas vs Warriors, there's no way you can say that matchups didn't make a difference."
Culture barrier coming from one of the premier basketball countries in the world? The one that just won silver and produced Tony Parker and Rudy Gobert among others?
"Wilt the only comparable talent at center during the era averaged 30 and 28 on Bills head and solid efficiency  and based on what your telling me, I'd rather have rudy gobert on those teams over Bill"
Just a blind look at DBPM career leaders w/o looking at tapes:  David Robinson  Tim Duncan  Hakeem Olajuwon  Kevin Garnett  Draymond Green  Ben Wallace  Kawhi Leonard  Rudy Gobert  Chris Paul  Joakim Noah  Michael Jordan  Manu Ginobili   John Stockton  Lebron James  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Scottie Pippen  Larry Bird  Dikembe Mutombo   And leaving out a few others who should be on this list.  You tell me I have to watch tape to see if these stats are wrong?
"&gt; Also Herro was in the trade talks  Yeah, I'm sure he was.  We just thought it was ridiculous that some fans thought Herro should be considered untouchable for Harden.  I mean, ultimately, it's not that bad, every team overrates their young players.  I've seen fans call the likes of RHJ, Stanley Johnson, Gary Harris, future stars.  Plenty of people on my team's sub think Mitchell Robinson will be Rudy Gobert that is also a 3pt marksman.  Every fanbase is guilty of this."
"KAT with good defense. Doesn't even have to be Gobert level, Thad Young's defense alone puts him pretty firmly ahead of Rudy as a clear top 3 center"
"To be fair, I think Mitchell has taken advantage of the good situation he's in, with Gobert there to clean up any drives. And honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Rudy just encourages Donovan to funnel guys in anyway, and it's their gameplan so why not.  That being said, I think it ends up just making Mitchell lazy on defense, which sucks when Gobert isn't flawless on any given night, or a team like the Clippers takes advantage of the matchup."
Rudy Gobert is terrible. All the other GMs when they go out to the bar they laugh at the guy who gave him a 200m$ contract.
"I’m sorry but like….The fact that he has a team with russel Westbrook, Lebron James and Anthony Davis in the same tier as a team led by Rudy gobert and Donovan Mitchell says all you need to see"
"Donovan Mitchell. I think it’s mostly a function of people always being ready to hate on Rudy but Donovan seems to escape criticism for things any other player would get crucified for (relative inefficiency, nonexistent defensive effort, not passing to his costar).   The fact that after 2019 most people were blaming Gobert and not Mitchell for losing to the rockets was just insane."
Rudy Gobert a top 20 player?😂🤣  My boi log off and think about what you just said. I'm sure you realized what a foolish statement that was.smh
I don't even think he is the most disrespected player currently active.  I swear half the people on this sub wonder if Rudy Gobert should be signed on a minimum contract despite being a top 20 players in the league rn.
Reggie Jackson drove it in his face and finished high off the glass like 3 times in a row lmao. I don’t want to hear about “hey this video of Rudy Gobert scaring off a 2v1 in a regular season game on a Tuesday proves he’s the best ever” when just another guy has no fear when it actually matters.
Translation for the nephews: Imagine Rudy Gobert or Draymond Green going to federal prison with 17 other players for PPP fraud.
"He is the Russell Westbrook of defense. His MVP season especially, he broke advanced stats. But would you really say he had the best season ever?   Gobert’s team creates a fundamentally flawed system that boosts his regular season stats, and gets exposed in the playoffs every time. While maybe any one of his DPOY awards could be argued as deserved, he is racking them up and could very well become the most decorated defender of ALL TIME. It’s clearly time to stop giving them until he can actually show his worth in a meaningful game.   There is clearly a problem with how the awards are given if Rudy fucking Gobert has more accolades than Duncan, KG, Ben Wallace, Draymond Green, Dennis Rodman, Mutumbo, or Kawhi. 6/7 of these players have led their teams to championships with defense. Gobert is a class below."
"True but it is an underselling story, probably becuase the average age here is getting lower and lower (or im just getting old) but some of these names were big back then. Tony allen going to prison is crazy. A similar active player would be like Rudy Gobert or Draymond green going to federal prison"
"&gt;Staggering minutes with your co-star isn’t exactly the best way to inflate someone’s on/off.  It is when the purpose of staggering the minutes is to play you more against opposing backups:  Gobert's on/off without Mitchell was *significantly better* than it was with Mitchell.  Clearly, the advantage of playing against opposing backups more than offset the disadvantage of those minutes being without Mitchell.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Anytime someone posts an on/off that high, there’s going to be explanatory circumstances.   None of the examples you proceeded to cite involved players playing a huge chunk of their minutes on a nightly basis against opposing backups.  And given that the Jazz +/- was better with Gobert/no Mitchell vs backsups than it was with Gobert/Mitchell vs starters, we know that's a *hug*e deal.     &gt;The Conley/Gobert and Dray/Steph on/off dynamics are pretty similar, but it’s pretty clear in each case whose doing the lions share of the work. Also in most of the Conley/Rudy minutes the other 3 jazzmen were usually bench players.  I still don't think you understand why I brought up Conley.  Also, the two top 6th man of the year candidates were both on the Jazz, so saying ""the other 3 Jazzmen were usually bench players"" doesn't carry the same weight in this context as it normally would.     &gt;And given that the 2021 Jazz had an all time great regular season by net rating, I really don’t think it’s that much of a stretch to say Rudy had an MVP level impact in the regular season.  You're taking way too much credit away from the fact that the Jazz are absolutely stacked with elite shooting.  This is part of the reason why advanced stats get such a negative rap - they're so valuable, but if you ignore context you get some really wonky conclusions.  Such as ""Gobert has a historically huge on/off - he has an MVP (LeBron/KD/Curry/Kawhi) tier impact.""  You can't just ignore that he played a huge percentage of his minutes alongside an elite bench against opposing backups, and none of the examples you cited featured that same advantage."
My favorite Ja Morant thing was him trying to dunk on Rudy Gobert every game in the first round
"Eh, there’s a lot of other factors to consider as well though. Every minute Rudy was off the floor Mitchell was on unless he was hurt or it was garbage time. Staggering minutes with your co-star isn’t exactly the best way to inflate someone’s on/off.   Anytime someone posts an on/off that high, there’s going to be explanatory circumstances. Steph has a lot of the highest on/off years on record, and in those years he played 90% of his minutes with Draymond and the warriors were also really bad in garbage time. The Conley/Gobert and Dray/Steph on/off dynamics are pretty similar, but it’s pretty clear in each case whose doing the lions share of the work. Also in most of the Conley/Rudy minutes the other 3 jazzmen were usually bench players.   Either way, regardless of circumstance you have to be an extremely impactful player to have that high of a differential. The only guys that have ever hit that high have either been MVP level guys or players that played almost exclusively with MVP level guys. And given that the 2021 Jazz had an all time great regular season by net rating, I really don’t think it’s that much of a stretch to say Rudy had an MVP level impact in the regular season."
Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert DPOY is the most egregious recent award.
Steve Nash. Marc Gasol. Rudy Gobert.
"Rudy is good, but didn't the Jazz play Gobert and Conley a huge chunk of minutes each night against opposing backups?  Felt like they were content to let the corpse of Favors hold the line as best he could against opposing starters so that Gobert and Conley could then destroy the backups.  That rotational strategy made Gobert and Conley's on/off stats look ridiculous."
"Rudy Gobert: I don't know how to guard zis, how you say, Terance Homme"
"If you’re going by the advanced stats, him and Rudy were pretty close and Gobert had more wins so it kinda matters how you treat that trade off.   Not saying Rudy should’ve won it but in the spirit of the going by the numbers it’s was close (on/off was heavily in Rudy’s favor at +19.1 to +6.4)."
"Not just an elite offensive player, Boban has been the single best player per minute in the NBA. Boban is the per 36 god monster.  From 2015-2017 if you calculate the win shares/48 of all players that played at least 10 games the list goes like this.  &amp;#x200B;  |2015-2016|2016-2017| |:-|:-| |Boban Marjanović (.325)|Boban Marjanović (.280)| |Stephen Curry (.318)|Kevin Durant (.278)| |Kawhi Leondard (.277)|Kawhi Leonard (.264)| |Kevin Durant (.270)|Chris Paul (.264)| |Chris Paul (.253)|Rudy Gobert (.250)| |Russel Westbrook (.245)|James Harden (.245)| |Lebron James (.242)|Jimmy Butler (.236)|"
rebounding rudy gobert
"The nuggets had a 122.1 defensive rating versus the suns (and the same rating versus the trailblazers coincidentally). The sixers had a 107.9 defensive rating against the hawks. Sure embiid got got at times but the overall result was much better.  And I think the consensus at this point was that DEFENSIVELY rudy was not at fault, the jazz perimeter defenders kept giving up penetration and rudy had to help off mann, who made his open shots (the main criticism of gobert is that he didn't punish small ball on offense but that's a different issue)."
"No Joe ingles, Rudy Gobert, Hassan Whiteside, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Bojan Bogdanovic, or Rudy Gay.  Let's go, Royce, lmao."
"Anthony Davis is the obvious comp and he loves playing the 4.   And just because they may have to move Allen later doesnt mean you cant play them together year 1. Playing Mobley at the 4 lets him develop more perimeter skills, which the Cavs want him to do. And they can still let him play the 5 in game. Mobley is skinny af rn too, give him time to bulk up so he can play inside better. Defending 4's probably will probably help alot too. He wont develop perimeter defense if he only plays the 5 and only guards smaller guys on switches. If he did that then either you hope he's naturally talented enough to do it or you get Rudy Gobert out on the perimeter a few years ago (Rudy has gotten a bit better lately)."
Tbh I think a team of   John Stockton  Joe Dumars  Khris Middleton  Shawn Marion  Rudy Gobert  Could compete with basically any all time lineup despite having 0 total 1st place MVP votes among those players. I think when most people put together all time teams they put 4-5 1st option scorers with redundant skill sets and don’t pay enough attention to things line defense and efficiency that scale much more than volume scoring.  I would honestly take the above team over something like AI-Kobe-MJ-Lebron-Shaq that’s got a lot of volume scoring but poor spacing and a defensive liability.
I was watching this [Rudy Gobert vs Hassan Whiteside ](https://youtu.be/VbGnvk23odA) clip and it shows some of the small things that Centers need to learn in order to be effective
"How many times do we hear “but can you play him in the playoffs when it matters” about a centre? Even the DPOY Rudy Gobert hang against the small ball Clips. But DA was asked to do so many different things during this playoffs, and excelled. The second round showed just how valuable he was because the Suns could play single coverage on Jokic which meant other guys were less effective. Jokic still put up great numbers, but he was less efficient than his regular season numbers for sure. Just look at the difference between Nurkic in round 1, to Ayton. Have to give this guy the max, the fact that I’ve seen a comment that says this guy is replaceable by Dwight fucking Howard is laughable."
"Dark horse candidate is Rudy Gobert, people always hating on him here."
Against Rudy gobert so many centers have had good games against him. Hell even Ben Simmons  Ben Simmons: 42/9/12 on 57.7% FG  Nikola Jokic: 47/12/5 on 65.4 FG  Joel Embiid: 40/19/3 on 51.9% FG  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 35/8/4 on 56.0 FG
Rudy 'Not actually Steph Curry' Gobert
Laughs contemptuously in Rudy Gobert.
"I have a very hot take about Ben Simmons. The take is, Ben Simmons being is valued incorrectly and is being unfairly compared by the media. The media wants Ben Simmons to be more like Curry, Trae Young, and Lillard because those are the type of players leading the PG position. They want him to develop a jumper to space the floor etc. Who i think the media should be comparing Simmons to is a player like Rudy Gobert instead because their roles are more alike and their numbers are kind of similar as well. Obviously Simmons has glaring weaknesses in his game like the free throw shooting that should absolutely be developed but his strengths should be enough to make up of the jump shooting."
"&gt;consistent DPOY candidate to justify a max  I mean Rudy Gobert is a consistent DPOY candidate and he is a supermax player.  The max for a young player this year is $28m.  Towns will make around $31m.  Bam Adebayo makes about $28m.  Jarrett Allen will make aroudn $20m this season (his contract is flat though, important caveat).  I mean maybe  you could argue Ayton is closer to Allen than the others. but I don't think I would agree.  I'd say he and Adebayo are pretty close.  The only convincing argument that there's a lot of daylight between them IMO is the rarity of Adebayo's skills - the playmaking and excellent 1-5 switchability.  Maybe that's enough to say he's in a different category than Ayton even if he's strictly worse in the other areas, I mean idk.  Given how bad the Suns were for the last decade and how difficult it was to come down with two high level prospects in Booker and Ayton, I say just pay the man.   If this goes on too long and he loses patience and decides to force his way out, it's going to be hard to justify to fans that the sticking point was like $5m a season."
"Not just offensively - but when you take combined overall 'post players' no way you can have Dwight ahead of Pau.   Not to underrate Dwight's defensive presence, but it's like lauding Rudy Gobert or Ben Simmons as some complete player because his post offense was THAT broken (otherwise he would've became Shaq).   I also wouldn't say Dirk was a better 'post player' than Pau although Dirk was the better player overall.   Pau lived in the post way more so than Dirk, and did more on the rebounding and defensive side of things.  You can even look at their %FGA and all that to see just how much work they were doing in the paint and in the high post.  Dirk had the more complete game, but Pau had the better inside game.   I don't think it's a stretch to put him in the top 10."
How tf is it disrespectful. Seems to me like you don’t watch Suns games so look at the stats.   DeAndre Ayton at 22 years old: 14.4ppg 10.5rpg 1.2bpg 62.6FG% 77FT% 30mpg  Rudy Gobert at 22: 8.4ppg 9.5rpg 2.3bpg 60FG% 62.3FT% 26.3mpg
"Didn’t Rudy Gobert get the max? If so, Ayton definitely deserves the max."
"Rudy Gobert is a system player. As in, he's the whole system. Only Jokic is comparable in that sense (but on offense)."
Rudy Gobert very recently got near supermax money lol
"Exactly. Ayton could make first team all nba just based on how weak the C position is. Embiid misses half the year, Jokic goes down. All of a sudden you have another Rudy Gobert with a $200 million contract in Phoenix."
"Because giving a max contract to a player who literally cannot create his own shot rarely ever works out  In fact the only guys like that in the entire NBA are Rudy Gobert and Klay Thompson, and one is a generational defender and the other a generational shooter   Ayton is neither of those things"
“All while being the defensive anchor” is the last refuge of scoundrels and people who love Rudy Gobert. Ayton is a really good NBA center. MPJ might end up one of the best shooters of all time.
"Isn’t this similar to the Rudy Gobert issue? Very good and important player. Probably not championship winning unless you have another star, most likely to carry the offensive load. I honestly don’t think they have a choice here. You almost have the bite the bullet. Especially since Phoenix hasn’t been a star destination as of late (unless you count Paul)"
"We treat people’s efficiency differently based on how well/how often they create their own shot and the volume at which they do it. That’s why Giannis, who scores 30 a game mostly unassisted, is looked at as a better scorer than Rudy Gobert, who scores half that and the only unassisted buckets he ever gets are putbacks. Absolutely nobody gives a shit where guys score their points when viewing them solely as scorers. Do you also think CP3 is a better scorer than Shaq?  Between “anybody can score that efficiently at that volume with a green light” and “Kevin Durant chooses to be less efficient” this is genuinely one of the most brain dead takes I’ve ever seen in this sub, and that’s a *high* bar."
"Lol what, who else is capable of generating shots within 5ft at the rate Giannis does? Shit, I can give you the full list - Zion. That’s it. If it was that easy every team would score 200 points a game and Rudy Gobert would be the GOAT."
"Richard Jefferson, deron Williams, Rudy gobert.   Decent players that specialize in something. Their games resonate throughout time."
"When Rudy Gobert was on the floor the Jazz had the #1 defense in the league, when he was off it dropped to 21st. /thread"
"Eh, I don't really buy the idea that Drummond was ""never actually good"", and I feel like there is scope for him to be a valuable contributor again.  We're just 3 years removed from Drummond's last All-Star selection, and just one year removed from a 5 season run of him averaging 15.9 ppg, 15.0 rpg, 1.8 apg, 1.6 spg, and 1.5 bpg, during which he led the league in rebounding 4 times, and led the league in Defensive Win Shares twice. If he was coached and used like Rudy Gobert, he wouldn't try to (or be allowed to) do too much with the ball on offense, wouldn't be a meme, and would still be a valuable high-paid starter, rather than a 27-year-old former All-Star with no significant injury history forced to take a backup role on minimum salary.  In hindsight, Detroit was probably one of the worst places for his development. He needed a consistent veteran influence, and steady firm coaching, to keep him on track in games and in development."
"This comment will be a great test to see if Rudy Gobert has a burner account from which he doles out Reddit awards the way Klay Thompson does.  Gobert might quite literally become the MVP overnight if the NBA removed the 3 second rule.  Edit: not a serious prediction, btw, and I know I have homer glasses, but I do think the odds would jump from something like 0.5% to 5-10%."
does anyone know if rudy gobert chose number 27 because he was the 27th pick? idk just wondering
For players still in the league that get signifcant minutes who is the:  * *Best player purely by size/physique*  * *Best player purely by skill/that can't rely on physique*  * *Worst player purely by size/physique*  * *Worst player purely by skill/that can't rely on physique*  IMO I think it's  Rudy Gobert  Steph Curry  Bismack Biyombo or Alex Len  Anfernee Simons
"Yeah but last year with an actual fucking pandemic,  Rudy Gobert shutting down the league, the Disney bubble, the evil empire lakers winning the chip, Harden forcing his way out to firm the eastern evil empire nets, Giannis going off in playoffs etc. There was so much drama that Simmons would only have merited a single episode anyway.  That's not even including the Olympics. They could have put in a special tournament in GoZ with Luka and Rubio heroics!"
"I meant to say the type of defense Giannis plays isn't as impactful as the type Rudy Gobert plays or the type Jrue Holiday plays. Plus they had one of the luckiest runs ever to win a championship. Still, the gap in defense doesn't make up for Luka being nuclear on offense."
Fancy talk from the person who confuses Rudy Gobert and Kanter.
"Here are some excerpts from the article where the author describes how Ben can be an effective halfcourt scorer (make sure to watch the including videos).   **Ben Simmons postup game:**  &gt; When thinking about untapped areas, I keep going back to that game from this February against the Utah Jazz, where Embiid was absent and Simmons went up against Defensive Player of the Year candidate Rudy Gobert. Ben ran the offense through the post, going against Gobert or others through backing them down. He’d take his size advantage and a cleared-out lane to his advantage. While we think so much about what Simmons’ lack of shooting does for Embiid’s spacing, we don’t spend nearly enough time talking about how Embiid’s presence takes away all of Ben’s post-up looks.  &gt; With that lane cleared, he could use his length to play one-on-one and his explosion showed. Great touch off the glass, good patience and use of pump fakes, and superb touch with both hands:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xUmbP75Jis  &gt; Size advantages create most of these opportunities, as well as the Jazz willingly playing him one-on-one. If Simmons gets enough volume in post-ups, we know he’ll hurt teams who do over-help and bring doubles: he’s far too good a passer in every other fashion for it not to translate. As for judging the sample of his time in Philadelphia, it’s so hard to look at the post-up numbers due to Embiid’s presence and both Brett Brown and Doc Rivers’ insistence on not exposing Simmons at the 5. If you do, as a scorer and passer out of the post, Simmons was just as efficient (0.99 PPP) as Giannis (0.99), Karl-Anthony Towns (0.966) and Jayson Tatum (0.959). That number should increase with more spacing.  **Ben Simmons pick and roll:**  &gt; As a pick-and-roll handler, Simmons’ violates one of my main tenets in initiating offense: he doesn’t shoot it. Teams can go under against him and clearly contain him from the lane, forcing him to either take the shot or not put enough pressure on the rim to force help defenders to collapse. Without helpers tagging the role and squeezing the lane, catch-and-shoot kickout avenues won’t develop.  &gt; Simmons encounters those issues on middle pick-and-rolls quite frequently, where driving around the screen would push him wide and ultimately away from the rim. On side ball screens, when his penetration around the screen generates a paint touch, he’s actually fairly effective. Part of the reason for that: teams cannot ice screens and go under at the same time. When they go under and try to meet him on the other side, Simmons is so damn lanky and long that one bounce and enough explosion allows him to get to the front of the tin.  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hb9C8kvGwQ  &gt; A great breakdown by Shehan here. Note that Embiid does a fantastic job screening his own man here so that Simmons only has one body to navigate and finish through.  &gt; Now imagine that play with one of the league’s premier pick-and-pop threats. Embiid can shoot (23-59 on pick-and-pop catch-and-shoot jumpers) but as we said earlier, he’s absolutely dominant on the blocks. Teams would rather live with the Embiid pop than anything he (or Simmons) get at the rim. Replace Joel in that action with a guy like Karl-Anthony Towns (24-59 but with a 60.2% aFG%, taking more treys) and perhaps the defense hugs KAT so much that Simmons gets to the rim, or even draws a help defender for a kickout.  **Ben Simmons in a free-flowing offense based on dribble handoffs:**  &gt; Clearing out one side of the floor just for Simmons to score in the lane isn’t an ideal usage of a team’s time. But there are great ways to flow into that action from a 5-out or delay series in the NBA. The quick swings and handoffs from the Indiana Pacers playbook last year are examples of how to get Simmons the ball on the move. Not only does that put him in the situation to play through the pick-and-roll but might catch some teams unable to go underneath screens:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKjMTEMUl5g  &gt; Here’s the catch: pair Simmons with the right team and he can be Domantas Sabonis in the clips above at times, too. A hybrid 5 who has the offensive game of a wing (think KAT, Christian Wood, Chris Boucher) to cut or space while Simmons trails to the middle of the floor would be incredibly dynamic, even if it’s only for brief moments. A small-ball Simmons at the 5 grouping might be the best way to unlock late-game or playoff Ben’s ceiling.  There's more if you read the article."
"That's just not true man. He wasn't a ""tank commander"" for us. That was the same season AD asked for the trade and to be honest Randle played the best on the team. He played the hardest too, that's with Jrue still on the team. He was played out of position because of our lack of center depth. Go back and watch him vs Rudy Gobert and the Jazz. Thats just a little glimpse into what he was forced to do for us that year. I'll always respect Randle for that. I hope he has another consistent year and proves the doubters wrong."

"This dude really thinks Rudy Gobert won THREE dpoy awards because he got emotional thinking about his mom.  You're acting WAY more dramatic than Rudy ever has.  You're legitimately a dumbass, dude, learn basketball before talking about it."
"It looks like Gobert over-trusted Conley as he stood slightly still on the switch and it looked like he’d aggressively rotate into the roller, but ultimately that’s not the defensive play Mike would’ve/should’ve made and this is ultimately on Gobert. A simple misread by Rudy, but solid exploitation by the Wolves."
"I really sat there and watched Rudy Gobert win 3 DPOY's, yeah.  I guess GrooveDigger47 is the real genius, and the dozens of profesional sports journalists who voted for him to win the award three times, and also the NBA players who voted him as the best defender twice are all incorrect."
"I really want everything you say about Butler to be true, but I think calling him a top-5 draft steal of the decade is kind of pushing it when this decade also has players like Rudy Gobert (27), Draymond Green (35), Jimmy Butler (30), Nikola Jokic (41), Malcolm Brogdon (36) and Pascal Siakam (27). That's five all-stars, four of whom are on a trajectory to being in the Hall of Fame, and a *very good* starting PG in Brogdon who is right on the cusp of being like a 15th or 14th all-star in a weaker conference.   I really want Butler to be that good, and I think he definitely *can* be, it's clear he's extremely talented, but I also think that saying he's ""already"" a top 5 draft steal of the decade is **very** premature, especially when you consider that we haven't even seen the first few years of guys who were drafted late in the 1st or mid into the 2nd round in the last couple of years. There might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now, and making a comparison with Butler to those guys who haven't had much of a chance to emerge is somewhat of a leap imho."
you really sat there and watched rudy gobert be a defensive liability vs the clippers looking like he has cinderblocks for feet and are going to die on this hill? but im the stupid one?   i bid you good day sir.
"You know, now that I think about it, Shaq had a really good point about Rudy Gobert being an overpaid bonafide scrub. Mitchell should demand a trade tbh"
DPOY Rudy Gobert who is totally worth that max lol
"But that’s the thing in all of it, he’s such a force that the entire opposing teams game plan absolutely has to address how to handle Rudy in order to win. You have to figure out how to counter him, and once you do, it’s Rudy’s job to then adjust. Sometimes he can be late to adjust, which is why you have situations occur like the one you’re arguing now. My whole point being that a casual fan would not understand the impact of Rudy Gobert from watching highlights and reading comment sections from other casuals. It’s an intricate game and Rudy is an absolute force."
"Those helpside blocks he gets will be harder when Steven Adams or Rudy Gobert are deliberately standing in his way and Chet is no longer reaching around a 6'7""-6'9"" 210lb teenager.   He will take time to adjust on defense imo"
You don’t receive 3X DPOY for being a poor player and there is a reason for it. Your not going to see highlights of Rudy Gobert making good defensive plays on r/nba. If you actually watched a Jazz game beginning to end you’d understand his true value.
"Jokic is a terrible defender. His dfg% within 6 feet of the rim is identical to enes kanter at 63.5%, with them tied for 5th worst among starting centers who played at least 20 games per NBA stats  Embiid is 53.9 dfg% at 11th  Rudy Gobert was first at 48%  46 players overall"
“Rudy gobert is really tall”
"Just be careful you don’t say “Rudy Gobert is really a modern big man, he really knows how to shoot the 3”"
"Embiid made statements to the contrary on Thursday, telling media members the Sixers’ decision to let Butler leave in a sign-and-trade to the Heat and then sign Al Horford for the 2019-20 season was a mistake. Embiid said the decision was made “just to make sure that [Simmons] needs the ball in his hands.”  Butler went on to have an All-Star campaign in 2019-20 and led the Heat to the NBA Finals in his first season in Miami.  “What Ben can’t be responsible for is the Sixers’ decision to move on from Jimmy,” the source said. “No matter what anybody said.  “This is what the team chose to do. So now when Jimmy goes to the Finals, that’s eggs on your face. That’s not Ben’s fault.” Ben Simmons (25) shoots as Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert (27) defends in the second half during an NBA basketball game on Feb. 15, 2021. Ben Simmons (25) shoots as Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert (27) defends in the second half during an NBA basketball game on Feb. 15, 2021.Rick Bowmer / AP Showing his worth  To be fair, Embiid is the better player and harder for opponents to scheme against. Simmons is also tougher to build a team around because of his offensive shortcomings. For him to be successful, he has to be surrounded with an army of shooters and a secondary ballhandler.  Yet Simmons still managed to make an important impact with the Sixers.”When Joel has not been durable, Ben’s been durable,” one source said of Embiid also missing time to injuries. “No offense to Joel, he deserves to have the team built around him. They made their bet around Joel, which is fine. He deserves that.”But Simmons has had some of his best games on nights when Embiid has been sidelined.  A prime example was his career-high 42 points to go with 12 assists and nine rebounds while playing center in a 132-124 road loss to the Utah Jazz on Feb. 15. Simmons even made 12 of 13 free throws.Back on Jan. 20, 2020, he had 34 points, 12 assists, 12 rebounds, five steals, and two blocks to lead the Embiid-less Sixers to a 117-111 road victory over the Brooklyn Nets. He made 12 of 14 shots and went 10 of 14 from the foul line while playing multiple positions.  And a source pointed out that Simmons led the Sixers to their final eight victories of the 2017-18 season with Embiid sidelined with a concussion and fracture to the orbital bone near his left eye.  ”They won those games with Marco Belinelli and J.J. Redick,” the source said of Simmons’ teammates during the winning streak. “Not James Harden. Not Kevin Durant and Kyrie, LeBron [James] and A.D. [Davis]. It was Marco Belinelli and J.J. Redick only to come back to the same style of play when Embiid returned for the postseason.” Being shopped for James Harden  The 2020-21 NBA season was the most difficult for Simmons, a source says.  Before the season, Simmons thought he would be traded for Harden.  In fact, he was so sure he would be dealt  that he went house shopping in Houston. A source said the Simmons camp was even informed by someone in the team that he more than likely would be moved.  “We realized this move was a result of putting all the eggs in Embiid’s basket,” one source said.  In Harden, the Sixers would have gotten someone to pair with Embiid such as when they had Jimmy Butler, but better. Harden finishes isolation plays by taking opponents off the dribble or burying step-back three-pointers. The Sixers needed someone to strike fear in defenders while making things easier for Embiid.  It didn’t take long for reports to leak that the Sixers were interested in acquiring Harden via a trade for Simmons.  At the time there were reports that Harden’s close friend, Meek Mill, wanted him to play in Philly. Harden and Meek Mill both have a relationship with Sixers minority owner Michael Rubin.  Morey developed a lasting relationship with Harden as Rockets general manager before joining the Sixers. The 2018 MVP, however, got his wish and was traded to the Nets.  Sources believe that Morey was never fully comfortable with Simmons at point guard. A team official refuted the notion that Morey didn’t like Simmons’ game. But other sources said Simmons noticed how Morey reacted during games when displeased with something the player did.  Simmons remained committed to the Sixers throughout the season. He had an ally in coach Doc Rivers, who went to great lengths to defend Simmons in the media. However, folks close to Simmons believe Rivers and Embiid threw him under the bus following the Game 7 loss to the Hawks. Sixers coach Doc Rivers says he wants Ben Simmons back on the team this season. Sixers coach Doc Rivers says he wants Ben Simmons back on the team this season. Elizabeth Robertson / MCT Time to move on  After the series with Atlanta, Simmons informed Paul that he wanted a change of scenery. Paul then told Morey two days later. Then the agent informed Sixers brass in person during a private meeting at the NBA draft combine in Chicago of Simmons’ intent.  In that meeting, a source said Paul told the Sixers that arming them with ample time to find a deal was Simmons’ wish. The source added Paul wasn’t demanding or threatening anything, simply informing them of Simmons’ decision. Paul told the team administrators to stop asking Simmons to be something he’s not and focus on what he’s telling them.  Paul told them, “He’s telling you that ‘I’m not coming to Philadelphia. My time as a 76er is done.’”  » READ MORE: Joel Embiid will be expected to do more on defense for the Sixers without Ben Simmons  The Sixers asked why Simmons wanted out, and Paul informed them that the point guard was mentally exhausted. The source believes they didn’t pay attention to Simmons’ state of mind or feelings about being in Philly because of the four years remaining on his contract.  “The icing on the cake came when Ben told the Sixers brass face-to-face during their August meeting in Los Angeles,” a source said. “He doesn’t have anything personal against Embiid. He also appreciated managing partner Josh Harris, co-managing partner David Blitzer and the organization and what they’ve done. But at the same time, it’s run its course.”  Now even if he does come back to Philadelphia, Simmons still doesn’t intend to play a game.  “You are never getting the same player back in Philly,” a source said. “You definitely are not getting him back in uniform. Even if he was in uniform, you are not getting back the same player.”  A source added that when a player is motivated to come back after defeat, they come back and you just know how motivated they are. Teams don’t need to convince them to return.  “You don’t have to ask and go searching,” the source said. “And when they don’t want to be somewhere, they tell you it ain’t going to work.”  Well, Simmons is speaking loud and clear."
You’d rather have Rudy Gobert than Draymond Green?
G - Steph Curry (5)   G - Lonzo Ball (1)  F - Josh Richardson (1)   F - Giannis (5)  C - Rudy Gobert (3)
"**EDIT**: missed the ""next five years"" because I'm a fool, this lineup could potentially do it because the old guys should age well but you can definitely build better long-term lineups.   * PG, Lonzo Ball: high-volume and high-efficiency shooter who's a great playmaker and good defender. The perfect 3&amp;D roleplaying PG to have alongside superstars.  * SG, Steph Curry: the GOAT shooter, perennial MVP candidate, plays great with other stars because of how well he does off-ball. * SF, Kevin Durant: three-level scoring monster who can hit any shot on the floor and is usually the best player on the floor. Plays very well with Steph.  * PF, Marcus Morris: solid defender who has shot very well from three lately. Perfect off-ball player for a team that already has ball-dominant superstars.  * C, Rudy Gobert: all-time great defender, currently best in the league. With four high-volume and high-efficiency three point shooters around him, Gobert's offense isn't an issue- as the Jazz have shown last year. This is essentially the Jazz's current offense, only with better guys in the starting lineup."
Kevin Durant  Luka Doncic  Rudy Gobert  Robert Covington  Brook Lopez  i.e. Luka with a 7-footer who can actually shoot
"Gobert:   * Unfair: he can't guard the perimeter. No, he's not gonna hang on Kyrie like he's Jrue Holiday. But there have been plenty of times where he rotates out to the perimeter and contests a shot- he contested 3.8 three pointers per game last year, seventh among consistent starters at center. He's sixth among starters in three-point percentage allowed, despite contesting more threes than all but one player (Chris Boucher) above him. And half the point of having Gobert to to make guys shoot from the perimeter; on average in 2020/2021, teams made 64.23% of their shots at the rim, compared to 36.7% from three. Percentage-wise, you want a giant guy in the middle forcing teams to take outside shots.   * Fair: his offense is an issue in the playoffs. He's a high-efficiency and super strong, but he basically can only score from dunks, and isn't absolutely elite at powering to the rim in the way of Giannis. Defenses can shut him down too easily in the playoffs, you really need someone who can score multiple different ways (Jokic, AD, Embiid) or is absolutely elite at scoring at the rim (Giannis). Gobert is only average, so teams will either throw a guy in the paint to force him into more difficult looks or let him get his easy looks but focus on locking down the Jazz's shooters. Then there's the hack-a-Rudy issue, which, while never as bad as Ben, is a concern."
"if you watched the Olympics the US team had a much harder time scoring too given the amount of talent on the team.  &amp;#x200B;  There's a lot of factors: there's unfamiliarity with the international standard game ball, the difference in officiating with FIBA refs not giving fouls NBA players are used to,  &amp;#x200B;  but IMO the biggest difference is the lack of defensive 3 sec, which allows for true zone defense where the defending center can just plant himself in the paint. NBA basketball has become all about the perimeter, where a blow-by after a screen leads to a scramble due lane penetration and inevitable scoring opportunities.  &amp;#x200B;  In FIBA rules a team playing zone defense doesn't have to scramble: someone like Rudy Gobert is there in the lane. This makes for a less drive-and-kick heavy game and more of a jump shooting game. Teams actually have to make their contested shots.  &amp;#x200B;  IMO the NBA needs to get rid of defensive 3 sec. It's an artificial rule meant to drive offense in the league. It's also hard to strictly call as the refs have to keep a mental count on every player on the court instead of just the offense."
Favorite: KD  Least Favorite: Rudy Gobert
"In fact him shooting 60% highlights just how bad a finisher he really is. I said this to someone the other day, he basically only takes dunks and layups. He has a similar shot profile and FT% to Rudy Gobert iirc but he shoots minimum 5-6% worse (I think actual number is 8-9).  Edit: just checked, Bens high for a season is 58%, Rudy’s *average* is 64.5% with his last three years being basically 67%+. Neither iso, nor take shots outside of 8ft, and Ben actually gets out in transition suggesting his finishing numbers are even worse than previously indicated"
“Ben Simmons scores 9 points against Rudy Gobert” isn’t as compelling I guess.
"So i guess Rudy Gobert, Ben Wallace, Draymond Green and more  aren't phenomenal players."
"""Wild"" or not, Chuck Barkley came down with Covid when it was first starting to become a pandemic. I don't know if whether that had an effect on his views about Covid, but I'm glad Chuck is using his reach and platform to speak up about it. I understand the stigma about vaccinations in the broad history of the Black American community and the government, but Chuck spoke about the conspiracies that Covid vaccines put tracking devices in us, saying that we all have phones and use apps where they use our GPS and what have you, so companies are already following us. To be honest, I didn't take Covid seriously at first, but the big turning points were when Rudy Gobert got it and the NBA at the time cancelled the season. Granted, Rudy is much, much, much better shape than I am, but seeing someone that close to me in age get it made me realize the potential severity of Covid."
Lol people downvoting. Gobert gets abused in the playoffs. The 25th best playoff player is probably like Jaylen Brown or Khris Middleton or KAT and I'd take all them over Rudy.
Rudy fuckin gobert. He barely puts up 15pts he’s not even in the top 25.
That guy literally saved so many lives. While also gobert.   Covid was a meme before Rudy went and thankfully contaminated a media room.
"Rudy Gobert with a jump shot was basically the envisioned high end outcome.  Mo averaged 3.7 blocks in college was a very productive rebounder and looked like he could be a threat from deep. He's also a really good athlete for his size in terms of leaping ability and covering ground + the biggest wingspan in combine history up to that point at 7'10 (Tacko broke the record the year after).  He's actually been very productive statistically in the NBA for the minutes he gets, he just hasn't translated that into positive impact at this stage + struggled with conditioning and motor especially after he got COVID."
"* Regular season: Rudy Gobert, offense-altering defensive presence who can make virtually any team into a top five defense.  * Postseason: Deandre Ayton, he's more able offensively than Gobert and giving the biggest, strongest guy on the floor the ball and letting him power his way to a bucket is a valuable weapon when your offense goes stagnant. Plus, while not on Gobert's level defensively, Ayton is still a very good defender and a bit more mobile/versatile and better 1v1; Gobert is a great player over a long regular season, and can be a great playoff performer (he dominated the Grizzlies, for example) but teams which stretch the floor but can also drive/penetrate (like the Harden Rockets and last year's Clippers) can really exploit his weaknesses."
"&gt;If you bench Gobert, what are you left with? 4 bad perimeter defenders and Gay playing the 5? Doesn't matter what principles you have at that point.  Well, no. I'm saying that I think a large part of the the perimeter defenders playing so ""badly"" was that it was the scheme of the defense: if opponents wanted to drive, let them. Taking Gobert off means you're playing an entirely different defense, which (presumably) means different principles. Now, it does matter whether your man gets by you, because it's not as sure a thing that he'll be properly challenged at the rim.   Again: if you're playing a non-Clippers team, then the smartest thing you can do is to let players get by you if they want to go to the rim, because Rudy will challenge them better than anyone else could. The Clippers were just able to have 5 shooters on the floor at all times, which mean that drives inside could be kicked out to an open man, since Rudy was always going to drop inside. Other teams wouldn't have 5 shooters, though, so Rudy's dropping inside didn't hurt the Jazz, since the rest of the Jazz defense could cover the dangerous shooters.  I'm putting quite a bit of stock in those 3pt statistics I cited earlier. The Jazz perimeter defenders were clearly doing some aspect of their jobs well, because opponents only rarely shot 3s, despite knowing the lane wasn't an option, and the 3s they did get off weren't good shots. To me, that points to that area of the defense strategically lacking against the Clippers, rather than simply being incompetent at their jobs."
"My point is that playing ""shitty"" perimeter defense *was* the right principle for the scheme that Quin wanted to play. If someone tried to drive on you, you'd put up a cursory effort but let them go, instead of challenging them all the way to the rim on their drive. The idea was to keep perimeter defenders on the perimeter as much as possible, to take away the 3 while Gobert took away the interior shot.  It wasn't until the series against the Clippers that that scheme started to break down, when the Clippers would simply overload the side of the perimeter that Gobert's defender was on, so they could always generate an open shooter when Gobert dropped inside to challenge the drive. Like you said, the ""better"" defensive principle would have been to stop allowing drives inside so easily, but the scheme had worked pretty well over the previous 80 games, and it's hard to completely uproot your entire defensive strategy in 3 games.  I still think Gay is a little preferable on defending the outside. Gobert's one-on-one strategy against quick guards has been to keep a respectful distance away, and use his length to overcome his lack of quickness if and when he's beaten on a drive inside. He's not someone that will go fully out on the perimeter and be able to interfere with motion that guards want to run, and it remains to be seen how well he'd be able to manage a switch-heavy defense.  Anyway. Point of all of this is that it'll be fascinating to see how Quin does use Gay going forward, because he's definitely a piece that the Jazz haven't had before in the Gobert era. Maybe Gay plays as a smallball 5, taking Rudy out of the lineup entirely against teams like the Clippers. Maybe Gay is just a secondary rim protecting 4, who can serve as an OK replacement for Gobert if Gobert is dragged outside. Either way, he opens up options."
"I don't think Rudy Gay at the 5 is that at all. He's worse than Gobert at every aspect of defense. Even if the task was to guard Steph Curry 1 on 1, I'd rather have Gobert out there than Gay. They need to do all the things you think they will do with Gay with Gobert. I wish it was simple as putting a worse defender out there to motivate the other players to actually play defense.  To your point, these defensive habits were built over the RS and multiple years the Jazz have employed the same system. If you let guys walk past you all year long, and it works, you're probably not going to be able to flip the switch and start locking guys up mid series. Same goes for off ball defense. If all you do is stay home and never leave your guy, you're not going to have the instincts to rotate and recover.  The simple presence of Gobert shouldn't automatically make everyone else play shitty defense. They need to have the right principles regardless of whoever is on the court with them. That is how they can succeed. Having a stretch 5 does literally nothing for them if the principles don't change."
"&gt;Jazz have to get out of their gimmicky defensive system  I mean... yeah. Playing Gay at the 5 *is* that. Instead of playing a leaky perimeter defense that doesn't give a shit if a perimeter player starts to drive, assuming that Gobert will cover the lane, now the Jazz can start switching, so the 5 comes out of the paint to challenge Jackson if Jackson manages to beat his defender, and the rest of the defense can rotate accordingly.  Also, I think there was an element of Quin instilling in the perimeter defenders that the non-Rudy defense stay outside at all times, so if an opponent got a step on a perimeter defender, the Jazz would just let that opponent go inside. The Jazz [had the 2nd best 3pt% defense in the league and allowed the 4th fewest 3PAs in the league](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021.html#per_poss-opponent::9), and they also allowed [by far the fewest corner 3s in the league](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021.html#shooting-opponent::30). We've always known the Jazz defense was designed around allowing only the midrange game, but the stats really bear that out. The perimeter defense was so focused on disallowing 3s that they stopped caring about interfering on drives to the rim - why bother, if Rudy will just swallow them all up?"
"Small ball 5 does nothing. Seriously, what does that actually help with and how does Rudy Gay solve any of the problems that the Clippers caused us defensively?  Does Rudy Gay solve the situation where Reggie Jackson walks past our ""best"" perimeter defender? Can he protect the rim and the paint at the same time? Gobert could not, Gay cannot, and nobody on the planet can either. Fact is, the Jazz have a sham system that works in the RS because Gobert is great, but it's impossible to have a one man defense in the playoffs.   Jazz have to get out of their gimmicky defensive system, stop relying on Gobert to do everything, and reestablish their principles to play defense as a team and not 4 statues around Gobert. Small ball 5 on exasperates the problems faced."
"The Jazz's problem last season is that they had no one - *no one* - who could play a role as a smallball 5. Favors was the backup there, and he couldn't get out of the paint any better than Gobert could. Not every team has the personnel to run an effective full-time smallball unit, but the Clippers do, and because of that, they were able to take advantage of the Jazz.  The Jazz went out and got Rudy Gay for that reason. Now - whether you think Gay moves the needle at all or not is definitely up for discussion. But the move does shift the Jazz from being a team with absolutely no plan B, to one who has one.   The Jazz's offense is still going to be just as good, most likely, unless injury problems arise. The key is that now they aren't as beholden to Rudy's strengths and weaknesses on defense, which should help."
Was rudy hurt that game? He was barely on the floor when Jokic was. I know Jokic is a tough matchup for rudy because it pulls him out of the paint but it seemed like he was barely in the game   Jokic had like 13 points on Gobert but most of the 47 was against Favors
"It's not even the basic stats, it's the weird stats that have Rudy Gobert top 5  If you go by just baseline stats you see that KD averaged more points on higher efficiency in the playoffs every year they were teammates  You also see that he's led the playoffs in PPG FIVE times while Steph hasn't done that once  And it's not like Steph is a better defender either lmao"
"Draymond is one of my favourite players in the league for all the reasons people have already mentioned but there is a good reason that defensive players will never be considered top 10 without also being good on offence.  Offense is just so much more valuable than defence in basketball, both because of current rules and because of how the sport is. Offence dictates the pace, defence is just reacting for the most part, with defenders literally having their back to the basket the entire time relying on other people calling screens, movement and switching and helping. Offensive players get to see the full court and decide what happens.  1 great offensive player (e.g. Kobe, Curry, Harden, whoever) can go out and get you 60 points by themselves. A great defensive player can't go out and stop 60 points by themselves. When a player can have so much impact on a game as producing a significant portion of a teams points then it's clear why those guys are ranked higher.  &gt; players of his ilk will never be properly valued by the general public.  You are totally right about this though, people really don't understand what it takes to be a good defender let alone an outstanding one like Rodman or Green. I put Ben Simmons in this category too kinda (obviously not on the same level as those guys), because people just love to meme his lack of shooting, ignoring his other offensive qualities (though lacking still) and his excellent defensive capabilities. Rudy Gobert is another good example especially after the recent playoffs and people laughing at ""screen assists"" when in reality that is actually a massively important skill and benefit he adds to his team beyond the boxscore."
A lot of the stats you are using to say Steph is better also think Rudy Gobert is a top 5 player in the league
"Russell would be a better version of Rudy Gobert if you put him in today's game  He was the best player at the time, yes, but that era is so far behind modern play it's not even funny  The ""plumber"" joke isn't appropriate for the 80s and 90s but it actually is for the 60s"
"But the ceiling is beyond the roof. He has the capability of being a 25+ ppg scorer, I don’t think Collins has the same upside as MPJ, and being in Denver it’s a great contract for both sides cuz what’s the odds of Denver picking up a player like MPJ in free agency. Little to none. This is essentially the Rudy gobert deal"
"True, Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell were fantastic picks."
"Wtf are you talking about? Yeah Rudy Gobert scores mainly from inside off of rim running, you cant throw Gobert the ball in the post and tell him to go and get a bucket like you can with Embiid. Actually the fact that Embiid can put up similar efficency to a rim runner as a primary post player speaks volumes to how effective he is down there.  Big men are encouraged more to shoot to be a *threat* from outside to open up the offense. It would obviously be bad offense for Embiid to start shooting from 3 at Curry\Lillard volume. Yeah Embiid is great enough to get those numbers even with Ben not fitting super well with him, but in the playoffs when the game slows down it can get baaaaad. Just watch BBALLBREAKDOWNs dissection of the Hawks series. Ben standing in the lane during halfcourt offense is a limiting factor to Joels potential."
"First off embiid has been doing just fine playing with simmons.  If you think he can do much better that 28.5 ppg on 64% ts I have news for you.  Secondly any center who has the ability to score from the outside is heavily encouraged to do so as it not only helps his teammates but also forces his own defender to player closer to him on the outside which opens up drives.  I don't get this argument, you know who scores mainly from inside?  Rudy Gobert.  I don't know why everyone all of a sudden wants embiid to mimic his play style."
"we also have not seen a center this great at playmaking either. The game is changing man basketball is slowly going positionless. The Nets would have easily won it all if healthy, what defensive juggernaut do they have?  A better defensive center would not have fixed Mitchell going bezerk. Instead Jokic torched a more ""traditional"" center in Rudy Gobert and averaged 26/8/6 on 63% TS coming back from a 3-1 lead. I don't see the issue here"
"Lol sure ignore that part that says “who can actually stay on the floor”  Please tell me, what was Gobert’s +/- in that series? Hate to break it to you, no one really cares about the Jazz on social media. Or the suns. There’s not some conspiracy to spin a narrative on Rudy Gobert bud. He just sucked.  At least Ayton took his team to the finals. When was the last time you guys were there?"
rudy gobert is so obscenely good at defense that I'm not sure the comparison is worthwhile
"Awards:      MVP: Steph Curry      Finalists:      Giannis Antetokounmpo      Nikola Jokic        I predict the top 3 seeds in the West will be the Jazz, Suns and the Warriors. Out of those 3, Steph is by far the best player and MVP candidate. If I'm being honest, Giannis and Steph are tied, and I have Steph above from bias. Both have fantastic narratives but that favours Steph, both can have fantastic seeds but that favours Giannis, both will have elite MVP stats, both will have voter fatigue but Giannis moreso, and I think Steph will go harder in the regular season. Jokic 3rd because like why not, he has a bit of everything, Trae probably 4th.        DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo      Finalists:      Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert      Rudy won't win it again. Simple as that. Not for atleast a few seasons. Draymond 2nd because of the seeding leap the Warriors can take. I think Giannis's focus will be more on offball offense and defense this year as the Bucks have focused on getting offensive upgrades this offseason.        ROTY: Cade Cunningham      Finalists:      Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes         Cade will have the best impact metrics because of how he will get the keys to Detroit and that's it. Detroit is Cades team already and that'll decide it. Barnes playmaking and defense already looks nice and Green is just too flashy and his scoring is super impressive at his age, they'll be top 3.  &amp;#x200B;     6th Man: Tyler Herro      Finalists:      Kevin Huerter      Dennis Schroeder  &amp;#x200B;  After his sophomore slump, I can see Herro taking a leap. His team will take a leap and he'll pair fantastically with Lowry. There isn't really any strong 6th man favourites to me, so I just threw in Huerter and Schroeder who's teams will be better this year.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Most Improved: Jordan Poole      Finalists:      Bam Adebayo      OG Anunoby       Jordan Poole has taken quite a leap once again, and his increased role will lead to a big stats leap. He's flashy and more importantly, the media is already acknowledging him. That's a key factor. Jokic became the MVP favourite because everyone just acknowledged it halfway through the season, I think it'll be a similar thing with Poole. Bam had a nice looking midrange last season that was gone during the playoffs, but with the addition of Lowry, I can see him not only taking an individual leap, but taking a statistical leap twice over due to Lowry. OG looks like his offensive arsenal has expanded massively, and while I don't know too much about him, I know he's one of the top MIP candidates/  &amp;#x200B;  COTY: Steve Kerr      Finalists:      Monty Williams      Mike Malone  Draymond, Steph and Poole are all high on these awards and Warriors will take a massive leap, easy.  &amp;#x200B;  EOTY: Marc Eversley      Finalists:      Bob Myers      Andy Elisburg  Just guys who made unexpected leaps in the seeding as GMs"

HOW GOOD DO YOU THINK EVAN MOBLEY WILL BE? I'M EXCITED TO SEE JA BAPTIZE HIM LIKE HE TRIED TO DO TO RUDY GOBERT ALL POST SEASON
"This article seems to agree with you...  **Is Deandre Ayton worth the max?**  Only four true centers in the NBA are making the max: Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic. Include part-time centers like Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo and the list still remains very exclusive. These are MVPs, Defensive Players of the Year, NBA champions, and NBA All-Stars we're talking about here. Thus far, Ayton has not crossed any of these thresholds.  The going rate for centers in that next lower tier down is substantially lower. Clint Capela and Myles Turner are both making less than $20 million this season, and they were meaningfully better regular-season players than Ayton last year. Capela finished sixth in Defensive Player of the Year voting and Turner finished ninth. Ayton didn't receive a single vote. Capela out-scored and out-rebounded Ayton in the regular season.  Of course, Ayton has only played  three seasons, and while his pre-draft pedigree alone shouldn't guarantee him a max contract, it does suggest more room for improvement than a typical 23-year-old NBA player would have. That upside was visible in the postseason, when Ayton grew into the sort of elite play-finisher and defensive anchor Capela was all season for the Hawks. If Phoenix believes he can maintain that form, he's immediately worth more than Capela.  The top group of centers encompasses players who are either elite shot-creators (Jokic and Towns), elite defenders (Gobert and Adebayo) or, in the rare cases of Davis and Embiid, players who are elite in both areas. Ayton might one day enter either or both of those groups, and there might be teams willing to pay him on the hope that he does. For now, he's a tier below."
"1. Anthony Davis, $32,742,000 2. Steven Adams, $29,592,695 3. Nikola Jokic, $29,542,010         3. Joel Embiid, $29,542,010         5. Kristaps Porzingis, $29,467,800         5. Karl-Anthony Towns, $29,467,800  7. Andre Drummond, $28,751,774 8. Al Horford, $27,500,000 9. Nikola Vucevic, $26,000,000 10. Rudy Gobert, $25,775,281 11. LaMarcus Aldridge, $24,000,000           Look me in the eye and tell me that maxing a center doesn't come without risk."
This.  See: Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert. Edit: Rudy Gobert that can actually score when he gets the mismatch in the post.
"1-3 most likely, their floor is really high unless Gobert gets hurt,they just generate wins with that system. Rudy Gay will be helpful in the playoffs,they don't even need him for the regular season. Like the EP addition too."
"idk but either way, ""rich man's rudy gobert"" is fucking good"
"&gt;Bill Russell with a 3 point line in the modern NBA would be a rich man’s Rudy Gobert     Is the implication that he can't guard the perimeter or that he can't shoot 3s so he wouldn't be good?"
Rudy Gobert?
"Thanks for doing tiers, way better. I'll do it too.

"Honestly, I'm not sure where this talk about DPOY-level defence came from. His advanced stats (box plus minus) say he is +0.0 on-off for defence. Other stats say +1.6 on RAPTOR which is good but nowhere near the better centers like Capela at +6.0 or Embiid at +4.6 or Gobert at +7.9 or 201920 AD at +4.3.  His counting stats are at 1.2 blocks and 0.7 steals, which are counting stats but every DPOY center has 2-3 blocks.  No one is legitimately paying him 172 mil when most stats give someone like Clint Capela (~20mil per year) is more valuable by almost all metrics. Even if the Nuggets didn't have Jokic, no-one is crazy enough to give him that offer sheet.  Plus, the post- or declining Chris Paul era is pretty uncertain. And you've just seen Rudy Gobert being played off the court by small ball lineups in the form of the Clippers.  They could've justified offering the max and providing little leeway to improve the roster next offseason. However, I find it perfectly logical to wait it out."
"He has a greater impact on winning than Karl Anthony-Towns who makes far more money than he does. Greater defensive win shares, better defensive numbers and doesn't have to touch the ball 100 times to have an impact. Fair enough if YOU or others don't think he's a max player who should make $35M a year BUT he's greatly important to Phoenix's title chances and when you look at centers around the league who aren't as good as he is, of course he's going to want some of that they're making. Not something silly like $17M a year. Lose Ayton, you're losing a chance at a title unless you replace him with like Rudy Gobert. Gobert, btw, a perfect comp to Ayton statistically although Gobert is better defensively (not a slight on Ayton there that's just how good Gobert is)"
1972 Lakers  PG: Damian Lillard (Gail Goodrich)  SG: Paul George (Jerry West)  SF: Tobias Harris (Jim McMillian)  PF: Jarrett Allen (Happy Hairston)  C: Rudy Gobert (1972 (not 1962) Wilt Chamberlain)
"The issue is the arguments you see for him deserving it is Luka and Trae got max contracts and he was drafted ahead of them. Ask yourself, if Ayton was the 10th pick of the draft and everything else about last season and playoffs stayed the same would people be insisting he deserves a max contract? Rudy Gobert is the best defensive center we will probably ever see for decades and alone makes the Jazz from an average defensive team to top 3 and people dont think he deserves a max. Unless Ayton develops an offensive ability close to Towns, Embiid, Jokic, ie give him the ball and he can score you 30 and run an offense, people arent going to think of him as a max player."
"Didn’t know that Rudy Gobert cried 11 times like that, what a stat guy you must be"
No they really don’t get swept. In fact they likely win for sure since the clippers would never be able to run small ball with batum at the 5. Ayton would feast.  The only reason the jazz lost is because Mitchell got hurt and gobert isn’t capable of punishing small ball lineups meaning they can shoot him off the floor. Swap Ayton and Rudy and the jazz kill the clippers on the board and prevent them from running their small ball
Rudy Gobert got spun in a circle one time by steph and all of the sudden the dudes a turnstile on the perimeter
"He's close... but you can't max a guy with an injury history (not saying it's serious or anything but it's there) that can *only* play the 5.  It's going to suck to let him walk but there's too much of a history in the last 5-10 years on overpaying big men.  I mean, I love Rudy Gobert but even his 5/200 is already getting shat on."
Because he just won another DPOY award. Oh wait that was Rudy Gobert.
"&gt; Comments saying Ayton doesn’t deserve this contract are behind on cap trends  Huh? Have you *seen* the market for non-shooting bigs? The only comparable player is Rudy Gobert, who most people agree was overpaid to keep in Utah because they can't attract FA. Every other max-contract big (Embiid/Jokic/KAT) can shoot."
"Ayton is great, but top 10-16 seems like it’s pushing it. He’s a unicorn who can basically score at will around the basket. That being said, he’s not exceptional for a big at passing or ball handling, and he can’t shoot. At his very best, he’s behind Embiid, Vuc, Jokic, and KAT at center for sure (probably also Gobert but I think Rudy is useless due to his inability to cover space on defence). Throw in AD, Giannis, KD, Zion, and Lebron and he’s already at 10 without any PG-SF. Maybe top 20-25  And like maybe this is me, but max contracts shouldn’t be awarded to players who can’t drive play. IMO Ayton will never be able to run his own championship caliber offence, so I wouldn’t give it to him. Totally see not breaking up the culture though"
Just look at how the Clippers series went and you can see Ayton is much better than Gobert offensively. You can actually give the ball to Ayton in the post and let him exploit mismatches in the post. He is also an elite free throw shooter for a big so he doesn't have to come out of the game in the last two minutes. You can also make a case he guards post bigs like Jokic better than Rudy 1 on 1 and is more switchable. Rudy is a far better team defender though. I haven't watched Capela enough to make a claim but I think theres at least a reasonable argument for Ayton over Gobert in the playoffs.
Holy cow you sound like a huge dray hater lmao putting Kevin love and Rudy gobert above Draymond in terms of resume.  He was absolutely the second most important player on the warriors before KD joined.  GS doesn't make back to back finals in 2015/2016 if they didn't have him
I don't get the arguments for overpaying. What other option is there that's better than Ayton? I don't think Rudy Gobert is planning to go to the Suns anytime soon.     It isn't just the money but there's a human element too. People want to feel appreciated
"I think centers that can't shoot and get assisted on 70%+ of their baskets aren't worth maxes in today's NBA unless they're Rudy Gobert on defense, and even then, barely."
"He was the 4th best player on the team, his championships don't count as much. Anyway, not counting Dray's teammates, other active players that have better resumes are:  Kawhi, Giannis, Harden, Westbrook, Kevin Love, Kyrie, Rudy Gobert, Chris Paul, Paul George, Anthony Davis. Sure I'm forgetting some."
"Another way to put it is:  If a guy like Rudy Gobert is able to average 15 points on like 65% shooting while basically having no offensive moves at all because of lobs and putbacks, shouldn't a more offensively skilled player be able to do the same thing but on higher volume?"
"If they make it far it will be because Clarkson and Mitchell chucked some 3s.   My point is that come playoff time Rudy Gobert specifically will have no claim to ""most impactful defender ever"" lol"
"Absolutely correct. ALL this man had (Still has) to do was come back and play hard. Everyone would've forgot about the Playoff performance by now. But because he did all this extra stuff it made the story bigger than it was and frustrated more people than necessary.  Rudy Gobert was getting roasted during the Playoffs too, but everyone already forgot all about that because he showed up back to work and everyone moved on."
Ben Simmons  Marcus Smart  OG Anunoby  Giannis  Anthony Davis  Bench:  Jrue Holiday  Draymond Green  Rudy Gobert
"I didnt say OG was bad. It was an analogy to show an even distribution of defensive coverages doesn’t purely measure versatility. Defensive prowess at each position is also important. I didn’t think I had to spell that out.  The irony of you claiming I don’t know how to read data is fucking laughable when you gave me that awful comparison two sentences later. Do you think the percentage difference between Gobert and KD vs OG and Mikal means the gaps in their creation abilities are at all similar ? KD takes 11.7 more shots than Rudy. Almost 3 times as many shots on his career. That’s an enormous shot creation disparity. Substantially more than two players with a 3 point shot gap... awful comparison.   I think Zach Lowe is an analyst and analysts often have terrible takes. Not necessarily saying Zach Lowe makes terrible takes, but an opinion is an opinion. Using somebody else’s opinion as a point for your own isn’t an argument and it’s not evidence. It’s just extremely funny how your argument was “somebody else said this” directly after claiming I don’t watch basketball.   There’s not a big gap whatsoever. There’s a reason only Raptors fans who are notoriously bias believe this take and you’re completely talking out of your ass when it comes to Mikal. Have you watched a single suns game ? Try posting the last part of this comment in the suns subreddit.  OG is LITERALLY a catch and shoot specialist right now lmfao, same as Mikal. But you’re comments regarding his defence prove you don’t have actually have a clue how Mikal defends and you’re just trying to hype up your own player.  I’m not gonna lose more brain cells talking to an ignorant brick wall like you, but like I said, feel free to post this in the suns subreddit and see what the responses are. I’m sure they’ll be just as non bias and logical as a raps fan like yourself making this absurd argument."
"...and now you're saying this, even though he leads the league in fg%?  You're worse at insulting Rudy Gobert than Rudy Gobert is on offense."
My list  ROY Scottie Barnes  6MOY Andre Drummond  DPOY Rudy Gobert  MVP Giannis
Rudy Gobert(if he got traded in this scenario).  I think he's getting a little underrated.  I don't think he'd be THE guy.  But I'd like to see what it would be like if he was on a team with better defenders.
"Different person, but same comment.  &gt;none of these guys are liabilities from the line in close games besides Simmons so I don't have to take them out  Brook Lopez: Career 79% from the line . Over 80% with the Bucks specifically)  Rudy Gobert: Career 63% from the line. He's not a ""liability"" but a bit too low for what I wanted either and I simply wanted to be a little different than what others picked or else everyone would be saying the same answer and that's boring af.  I wouldn't call y'all crazy, but man some of you handle different opinions like fucking children."

Keep those emotions in check kid......or don't and have more people laugh at you."
lmao  Also Rudy Gobert is starting OP idk what you're on. Dude has won DPOY three of the last four years. Simmons / Thybulle / Giannis / AD / Gobert. Not sure how you convinced yourself to get Isaac in there over him. Also he's not about to defend any NBA players if he can't defend covid.
But Rudy is actually pretty good at iso guarding. Kevin O’Connor recently put an article out on the Ringer about Gobert that details this
"Kinda easy when you can pick superstars like AD or Giannis IMO, so a true ""fuck offense"" line up...    -------------------  Ben Simmons  Marcus Smart  Matisse Thybulle  Draymond Green  Rudy Gobert"
"Because Bam was worth that extension at the time and Ayton won’t be worth it for another year or two.   We maxed Bam because worst case scenario, one of our max players is an elite rim and perimeter defender, with elite playmaking ability for a big. Worst case with Ayton is maxing Rudy Gobert Lite."
"G - Jrue Holiday   G - Ben Simmons   F - Draymond Green  F - Giannis Antetokounmpo    C - Anthony Davis  Bench: Rudy Gobert, Alex Caruso, Marcus Smart, Jonathan Isaac, OG Anunoby"
"Talk to me when Isaac actually gets on the court. And it isn't Rudy's fault that his guard and wings can't stop dribble penetration. Rudy getting played off the court against the Clippers was the fault of Conley, Ingles, Mitchell, Clarkson being poor defenders when the ball handler drives.  Giannis wins because he is a godly defensive player **especially as a help defender** in conjunction with being a great offensive player even with his clear limitations.  Clearly you don't watch Giannis or Gobert beyond highlights, low lights and memes if you think they are worse help defenders than Isaac. Isaac is a fantastic defender, but he ain't Giannis or Gobert. He ain't even AD as a help defender."
"If you don't think Giannis ""I Won Back To Back MVP Cause Of My Help Defense"" Antetokounmpo or Rudy ""Year In Year Out The Best Defensive Big In The League"" Gobert"" are better help defenders than Isaac, you need to be put on the Jalen Harris plan."
Those are Rudy Gobert numbers
"I think they need another big wing who can defend, I loved them getting Rudy Gay, think they just need one more player like that.  I’m done with the idea of Bogie being a starter on a title team, his defense sucks too much. Bogie Ingles Clarkson should all be role players off the bench.   I like the Conley Mitchell ONeale Gay Gobert 5, but I’d want them to get somebody like Thad Young so they could also have the ability to play small if necessary."
Rudy Gobert averages 20 ppg
Rudy Gobert takes and makes a three pointer this year in a game
MVP: Luka Doncic   DPOY: Rudy Gobert   6MOY: Jordan Clarkson   ROY:  Jalen Green   MIP: Michael Porter Jr
"Nets kill it to start, Blake returns to form, but play spotty when Kyrie returns and fizzle out in the post season.  Boston kills it and wind the east.  ATL fails to build on last season.  The Mavs fire Kidd half way through the season.  The Warriors win 60+ games and Wiseman gets MIP.  Lakers struggle to start but turn it on at the end of the season.   Lakers win the title, but it's Westbrook who wins FMVP.   Which is odd, because AD win the regular season MVP (and finished top five in MIP).  Rudy Gobert does NOT win DPOY.   Embiid has a season ending injury after the All-Star game."
"I don’t think anybody will, I mean fox postered gobert and nobody talks down on Rudy for it"
"honestly, he's not bad as a 3rd string PG. he's pretty decent at catch and shoot 3s and can drive well. but do know that just about every fastbreak he has the ball, he is taking that thing up STRONG even if rudy gobert and AD are there to contest lol"
"Box out Joel Embiid, Steven Adams, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, etc for 5 possessions and lmk how you’re feeling"
Bam just put up 19/9/5 with all nba level defense. Also shot 80% from the stripe. How tf is Rudy gobert better then bam
Rudy Gobert will always be remembered as the catalyst to the NBA shutdown and consequently America declaring a pandemic.
i had myself convinced Rudy Gobert was gonna be a top-tier center his rookie season. And in hindsight...I don't actually know why....
"Worst: Michael Beasley, Derrick Williams  Best: Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green"
"I don't think it's that our guys are bad per se, but it's a matter of roster construction. The team knows that as a small market, it has to play on some sort of inequity in the market, and that was poor/slow defenders who are good offensive options. Rudy would cover up their mistakes and they would theoretically lead us to an amazing offense.  Problem with this was a lack of roster flexibility. By the time the Clippers series rolled around, our main rotation consisted of two hobbled lead guards (Conley/Mitchell), an amazing sixth man who was a traffic cone in iso defense (Clarkson), and slow wings (Ingles, Bojan, Niang). The only good and laterally quick defender other than Gobert at that point was Royce O'Neale. Legit no one was coming to save this rotation. Opposing guards would blow past our injured or poor-technique guards or laterally slow wings and there was no recourse. We couldn't even put out a defensive-minded lineup."
"I was looking at [ESPN's top 74](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/29105574/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-74-41) recently.   Damian Lillard was 72 and I think that's a pretty decent benchmark. Dame being right on the edge of making the list sets the stage for a lot of current players missing out.   The other borderline guy I liked was Mutumbo. With 8 All-Stars and 4 DPOYs and still only being borderline, it sets a decent precedent for guys like Rudy Gobert, Ben Wallace and Dwight Howard."
I work as a Chef specifically with non-profits in Utah. At my previous employer Rudy Gobert helped donate and feed thousands of children. He also donated so much to our annual Christmas programs so families could enjoy the holidays. When I heard about this project I was also so relieved. Food reliance throughout the country is so important especially for our young children. What a dude.
"Donovan is definitely a draw for free agents and I think everybody knows you're just missing a few pieces, not so different from Milwaukee a few seasons back.   IMO you just need one more wing player after the addition of Rudy Gay, somebody who can kick Bogie out of the rotation. If I were the Jazz, I'd be doing everything I can to get my hands on Thad Young.   The ability to go small with Gay and Young at the 4/5 would give you a much needed different look defensively when Gobert is on the bench instead of trying to run the same defense with a shitty backup like Favors was last year or Whiteside is in general."
"He's not blaming Rudy. He's saying that they got complacent over the regular season because Gobert covers up so many of their mistakes. The playoffs expose those weaknesses more, because suddenly Gobert was defending someone in the corner rather than a big guy near the paint. It's not Gobert's fault, but it is a result of Gobert being so good."
\*breathes on food\* \~ Rudy Gobert
Now this is worth talking about! I have no more slander for Rudy Gobert.
Fix my headline:  Self-made millionaire athlete and Utah resident Rudy Gobert does something for the poor people in his area because the government doesn't feel the need to.
"Nah man. Rudy Gobert is extremely valuable, its just in the regular season."
"This speaks to the age-old conversation about the championship value of players whose primary contribution to the game is defensive. In general, we see the value of individual defensive performances decrease in the playoffs as even mediocre defenders tend to raise their floor just by the virtue of giving playoff effort. There is also the factor that a 7 game series allows coaches ample time to identify and implement schemes to work around an individual player's defensive strengths.  Combine this with the fact that you don't play rotational basketball in the playoffs, allowing coaches to keep mismatches on the floor for a much larger portion of the game and that Rudy carries the load defensively for the Jazz and you get a situation where an objectively excellent defensive player like Gobert can look like an expensive liability come playoff time."
So what? If you threw Rudy Gobert back there he’d still be one of the greatest defensive centers ever. He’d probably be even better back then without small ball being a thing. He’s also a much better offensive player than Wallace was. Don’t pretend that Wallace would’ve been able to stop what the Clippers did to Utah this postseason.
We are not gonna slander Ben Freaking Wallace just to prop up Rudy Gobert.
"Rudy ""JPMorgan Chase"" Gobert"
"&gt;#####Rudy Gobert has become one of the most dominant defenders in recent history, but opponents have been able to knock the Jazz out of the playoffs by using small ball to neutralize the 7-footer. Can the old-school center stand his ground in the modern NBA? The game’s best shot-blocker has dealt with rejection plenty of times before."
"He definitely wouldn’t be a Rudy Gobert type on offence.   Rudy’s strength as a rim running comes so much from his length, and the difference in Rudy’s standing reach and Bens would be staggering. Rudy has a 9’9 standing reach, Ben was listed as 6’9(although the was probably closer to 6’6-6’7) with arms that were insanely long. Good chance his standing reach would have been under 9’  Wallace just really wasn’t an offensive threat, so I don’t see how his offence would be similar to the beat rim runner in the league. To be honest he would be lucky if his offensive game was close to Robert Williams."
"I’m actually quite torn on this subject.  I can see him becoming a Rudy Gobert type player on offense, but worse. The most intriguing, obviously, would be on the defensive side, where he would excel.  Negatives: He had bricks for hands, couldn’t really catch a ball and had arguably the worst touch around the rim of all time of any notable big man, and his offensive awareness wasn’t that good. The spacing would be terrible, he shot over 50% just twice during his 10 year prime, and he has the worst FT% of all time I think. Career TS% is something like 46.5TS%  Positives: all time great defender and defensive awareness, great man-to-man defender, great help defender, as strong as an ox, above average perimeter defender (much better than Rudy, but not as good as Draymond for example).  I think he would have to have a perfect system to play in, like D12 had in Orlando, or small ball Rockets. Superior spacing and he would/should thrive.  I can on the other hand see him becoming a playoff liability like all time defender Tony Allen vs. Golden State and Ben Simmons vs. last years Hawks and Andre Roberson vs. Every team.  It all comes down to fit with the team and matchups, even though he is an all time defender. The game is so predicated on spacing nowadays."
When was the last time you watched a Ben Wallace game?  Because I recently watched an 05 Pistons vs 05 Suns game on Youtube and Ben Wallace was bricking wide open dunks and layups left and right.  They man had no touch around the rim and that was playing next to another stretch big for good portions of his minutes against a poor rim protecting team led by Amar'e Stoudamire.  Rudy Gobert finishes nearly 65 percent of his field goals off the top of my head.  He lacks a great post game but he's the most lethal pick and roll big man in the league outside of Giannis and Zion who do a lot more ball handling than him.  Rudy destroys Ben Wallace on offense and you'd be surprise by how close they are as rim protectors and shot blockers.  You can even argue Gobert is better than Ben Wallace at that.  What Ben is better at is moving his feet and getting his hands in the passing lane.  Plus his post defense was really elite for his size compared to the rest of the bigs in his era.
"Not sure how his on-ball perimeter D would look like since there is a small sample size on that (or I could be wrong on that). His era was a lot of ISO so we have no idea what he would look like in a switch heavy defense. Rim protection would be top notch tho. I can just say that Ben’s agility is a huge plus when defending 5 outs and pick and rolls.   On the other end, teams can just play 4v5 on defense since Big Ben really sucked on offense  He has a place in the league if the likes of Rudy Gobert has a place. Not sure if he would be a championship caliber center in this era tho. Guess that would depend on the team he would be on."
&gt;The Jazz who had the /#1 DRTG with Gobert on the court where also 25th when he went to the bench.   &gt;   &gt;The Jazz were +33 in the playoffs with Rudy on the court and -9 when he was on the bench. We were also outscored by 51 in the Clippers series and +26 better with Gobert on the court.  Can you give sources?
"hes also the best screener, best rebounder, best rim runner and lob target  the jazz lose a lot when gobert goes the bench, besides obviously the massive defensive presence  hes a good player. people dont really like him, but i watch a lot of basketball, jazz and not jazz, and rudy gobert is a good good player."
With Gobert it's part of a trend where on/off type of stats tend to rate players who happen to have a skill that the rest of their team doesn't the highest  So basically Rudy rates so highly because the rest of the Jazz suck at defense and when he goes off the court they have no defense at all
"i think hes a difficult player to rank  against a team that just runs into the paint and gets owned all the time, rudy is as good as anyone, top 5 type shit. when teams go into him, thats what the jazz want, because hes incredible.  smart teams that dont go into the paint as much, or just wait until gobert is subbed out to attack the rim and just put a bunch of shooters on the court the rest of the time. This makes it harder for gobert to impact the game as much"
"&gt; his impact on a game is on par with basically anyone in the league.   No doubt. He led the league last season in On-Off +/- per 100 possessions at **+19.1**, the next best in the league was +13.2 for reference. The Jazz who had the /#1 DRTG with Gobert on the court where also 25th when he went to the bench.      The Jazz were +33 in the playoffs with Rudy on the court and -9 when he was on the bench. We were also outscored by 51 in the Clippers series and +26 better with Gobert on the court."
"the jazz are so bad without rudy gobert  i think hes actually that good. his impact on a game is on par with basically anyone in the league.  hes got some limitations, obviously, but on a game to game basis the team that has rudy gobert wins most of the time"
"as much as i love him, probably rudy gobert. there was that whole thing about how he had the greatest statistical defensive season (since certain metrics started being measured) and most of them have him as like a top five player in the league or something crazy like that"
Ben Wallace was the best defensive big of the lot and he’d be worse. Can’t have somebody that makes Rudy Gobert look like Hakeem Olajuwon offensively playing big minutes like that in the era of pace and space.
Point Finney-Smith is unbeatable as long as he has Rudy Gobert on him
Love the honourable mention of Rudy Gobert for the #10 spot.
Rudy Gobert or Ben Simmons
"I'd say that scoring is overall the least valued of the trio of playmaking/scoring/defending in general in most RAPTOR stats  Like they will have Rudy Gobert as the 2nd best player in the league and until the last season or two Kyle Lowry as fringe top 5  KD's never had good RAPTOR, if you look at their page they have KD ranked below Kyrie in terms of total rating"
Imagine Rudy Gobert with at least somewhat decent mid range game
Rudy Gobert on the Nets
"Giannis ""Rudy Gobert"" Antetokounmpo"
More like Kevin “Rudy Gobert” Durant. Have some respect
"Jazz match up amazingly against the Lakers. Rudy Gobert is Westbrook kriptonite, they have no one that can deal with Mitchell defensively who has always stepped it up in the playoffs, and I think will make a huge leap this year, as they traded all of their perimeter defence away.  They lost to the clippers because they had 5 spacers and that destroyed their system. Also the clippers are an amazing defensive switching team with elite perimeter defensive talent. The Lakers are none of these."
Rudy “Kevin Durant” Gobert
People might not like it but Rudy Gobert being pump faked on the perimeter by Brook Lopez while a guard commits a defensive 3 second violation is one of the greatest single possessions in NBA history.
"I think they’ll go until they run into the Jazz. Having your 3 stars be Russ, AD and Lebron and having to play against Rudy Gobert is just a bad matchup for the Lakers. They won’t be able to keep up with our shooting by taking it inside, but that’s what their roster is built for. Russ in particular is pretty much useless if Rudy’s on the floor."

"Rudy Gobert out here like ""???"""
"Dejounte Murray, DeAnthony Melton, Rudy Gobert"
"USC fan here, watched every one of his college games. He looks way more capable offensively than I expected. In college he didn't really have a ""bag"" or any kind of counter moves to create his own shot down low other than just being bigger than everyone. I expected him to be more of a Rudy Gobert/Clint Capela type of player on offense whose main offense would be lobs and putbacks. But he looks a lot more polished than I expected."
"Tl;dr it doesn’t mean anything they just wanted a name for their advanced stat aggregator and the Raps just won the championship:  At FiveThirtyEight, we’ve been running NBA predictions since 2015. We started with Elo ratings before introducing our CARMELO player projection system, which we then incorporated into our “CARM-Elo” season prediction model. We tested and tweaked the prediction model over the years, but it was always powered by metrics from other sources, such as Box Plus/Minus (BPM) and Real Plus-Minus (RPM).  But that changes this year. RAPTOR, which stands for Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings, is FiveThirtyEight’s new NBA statistic. We’re pretty excited about it. In addition to being a statistic that we bake in house, RAPTOR fulfills two long-standing goals of ours:  First, we wanted to create a publicly available statistic that takes advantage of modern NBA data, specifically player tracking and play-by-play data that isn’t available in traditional box scores.  Second, and relatedly, we wanted a statistic that better reflects how modern NBA teams actually evaluate players.  NBA teams highly value floor spacing, defense and shot creation, and they place relatively little value on traditional big-man skills. RAPTOR likewise values these things — not because we made any deliberate attempt to design the system that way but because the importance of those skills emerges naturally from the data. RAPTOR thinks ball-dominant players such as James Harden and Steph Curry are phenomenally good. It highly values two-way wings such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It can have a love-hate relationship with centers, who are sometimes overvalued in other statistical systems. But it appreciates modern centers such as Nikola Jokić and Joel Embiid, as well as defensive stalwarts like Rudy Gobert.  /u/velvithippo"
"If that were true why were the Jazz substantially better defensively with Rudy on the court than off it, even in the playoffs?  And that’s simply not true. Go back and watch the film instead of simply parroting what you’ve heard Twitter users say. Gobert wasn’t sitting in the paint, he was out on the perimeter with Batum and Morris. Because they’re not ball handlers he wasn’t playing right up on them but was close enough to deter a pass/ quick catch and shoot. The issues came when mitchell and Conley and ingles and bojan and co got beat every possession, which means Rudy had to collapse or it was open season in the paint. This caught him in no mans land cause him collapsing gave his covers the chance to spot up from 3. It was an abhorrent defensive situation no big man could succeed in."
Why do you think jazz sucked on defense? Cause the clippers played five out and they made Rudy gobert stay in the paint when his guy always got an open look. If gobert was good enough to post up a guy a foot shorter than him then the clippers would not be able to play five shooters. That’s why gobert was such a liability. A center getting Max salary should be able to abuse another team starting a sg playing center.
Rudy Gobert seems like a big target recently and I don't see the Jazz going that far
Rudy Gobert
"While I agree with most of this, Rudy Gobert is a bad comparison. Rudy has a specific roll that Utah is happy with. 3 point shooting is the last area they’d ask him to improve on. A better comparison would be giannis.  Ben is a point guard. The player with the ball in his hands most. He needs to be at least somewhat of a shooting threat to have any form of gravity and not be a playoff liability. And the only way to improve on a jumper is to practice and work it into your game. Giannis takes 3-4 3s per game and his shooting has improved. His actual 3s haven’t improved that much but his mid range and especially his free throws have, and he can at least occasionally punish teams for leaving him open. Philly regular seasons are low stakes anyways since they have the talent and defence to basically be guaranteed home court barring injury"
People that tell Simmons to shoot are stupid. He cannot shoot. It’s like saying Rudy gobert should start shooting to be a stretch 5. Like no shit that would help the jazz but there is a reason he doesn’t shoot cause he cannot. Simmons has been in the league for 5 years and can barley make a 15 foot jumpshot. There is a huge gap between Westbrook and Ben Simmons shooting ability.

"80/20 for point guards. Notice how the superstar point guards are abysmal at worst, average at best on defense.  This is due to size mismatches on switches, mostly, so not really important for PGs to play D in this era.   SGs- 60/40. Obviously you want your off guard to have offensive prowess but you also need your SGs to pick up the best guard assignment when your PG can’t. (i.e, Klay for Steph)  SF -60/40. Just a bigger version of an SG. Also normally the most versatile defensive position.   PF- 50/50. You normally run PnR with this guy so his offense would be served on a platter to him. His ability to switch on a PnR is also crucial since the league is high PnR heavy today.   C- 30/70 (except for Jokic) - Historically, Centers have been the most important defensive position because of rim protection. Still is true to this day. Rudy Gobert is the prime example of this. His defense is more impactful than his offense. Other examples include Ayton, Capela, etc where their offense is not really necessary, but rather a bonus."
Idk I think Rudy Gobert deserves a shout too
He's already a star but Rudy Gobert before the three point era would be almost unbeatable
"Of all the things about the NBA, probably my least favorite is how refs seem to take pity on smaller players and let them play by different rules. If Tyler Herro bear hugs Rudy Gobert on a roll, it should still be a foul despite Rudy being a foot taller.  That being said Rudy needs to do a better job of not letting no-calls affect him mentally. It’s been a recurring trend that a few bad calls and he gets frustrated and plays poorly. Not a great showing from him tonight."
Really annoying having to watch Rudy get bear hugged every time he gets into the paint. We need to just throw him the ball in that scenario because it won’t get called a foul until Gobert actually gets possession.
"I don’t think we’re talking about the same definition of “scheming out.” Rudy Gobert is physically incapable of defending switches, and his coach is unable to fix that.  Draymond turns it over a lot and sucks at scoring, and coaches can exploit that. But in the playoffs being an offensive liability is better than being a defensive liability. And Kerr and our coaching staff knows how to mitigate it, by playing 4-out lineups and using Draymond in DHO’s to punish his defender for sagging off.  I’m not just talking about this year. The criticisms of Draymond have been the same for the past half decade, and he’s a much worse player now than in 2015. But he’s still a specialized player who is useful to GSW.  It’s like buying one of those $10k Apple displays. Most people don’t need one and you’d get much better value elsewhere. But if your career is graphic design maybe you can justify it. GSW is a graphic designer and Draymond is a $10k display."

"if you really think about it, Rudy Gobert changed the world. I can't remember a single thing related to covid happening here in the US until Rudy went up there spreading covid in his interview.. triggered a global shutdown. 😂"
"After playing what I think someone said is the hardest strength of schedule for the first 7 games, playing the Pelicans and Hornets back to back at home really felt different. The difference between going against Rudy Gobert in the paint and this Charlotte defense man"
"G clarkson  F ingles  F bojan bogdanovic  C rudy gobert   ...and now we just need to yoink a point guard, so lets take doncic there"
"true, but in the long run a lot of people will end up much richer than him. Shaq got 400 mill right now, and he had to literally be a hall of famer to do it.  Rudy Gobert signed a 5 year $205 million contract, on top of his $138,035,168 career earnings. thats like 300 mill right there, not to mention whatever he might invest in to grow his wealth.  and he ain't a house hold name. this is why Shaq hates him."
Gobert driving to the hole sucking in 3 defenders like a singularity.  That should help all the nephews that don't understand Goberts impact on offence and ability to get his shooters good looks.  This happens every single time the Jazz set a high pick with Rudy and he rolls hard.
Bro this list is dog shit luka shouldn't be higher than jokic or Giannis. Rudy Gobert being in the top 6 when pg is having a crazy year   Dumb list
Rudy Gobert is probably a top 10 most impactful player(at least in the RS) but he will never ever be considered for something like this because of his playstyle
"Right, but Rudy Gobert should be top 3, easily, by that metric."

"They’re a regular season team, Gobert got exposed by the Clippers and they don’t have another elite scorer besides Mitchell, and Rudy Gay is not the difference maker for a team being in championship team contention ☠️"
"I can't keep going back and forth with you. It is so very apparent that you can only assess players by box scores and basketball reference stuff. That's not how actual real world evaluation works. You are completely and totally on your own with this evaluation because you can't or won't assess anything except for box scores with players.   Everthing is a gamble. The Lakers trading very good players for Kobe Bryant who never played a game outside of high school was  gamble. The Wolves taking KG 1st overall out of high school when he didn't play in a huge bball talent pool is a gamble. Philly taking Embiid despite him only playing basketball for like 4 or 5 years and having a foot issue already is a gamble.   They are all calculated risks, calculated risks are gambles. But they aren't blind shots in the dark.   Once again, there is a reason why every front office would have given Jamal the contract he got to keep him and was a no brainer for the Nuggets, and why Sexton will absolutely not be getting it.   There's a reason that despite Mikal Bridges averaging 14/4/2/1/1 on 54/43/84 as a 24 year old got him 100m instead of the 180m super max. Those numbers are insane if scaled up even a little tiny bit, so why didn't he get a max?   Because you have to watch him play to actually understand that. Just like you have to watch Sexton playing to understand he isn't actually a better offensive player than Jamal Murray at all, and doesn't have near the ceiling. You have to watch the games. You have to watch the players playing. Rudy Gobert scores 16 points on 65% from the floor. He is nowhere near the scorer nor does he have the potential as Evan Mobley -right now- who is scoring 13 on 49%.   All stats aren't equal and it is painfully obvious you didn't watch Jamal Murray carefully enough and you may have not watched a single Sexton game ever.   By all means keep telling saying that the best evaluation and talent growing front office of the past 5 years, who work to make the proper basketball and financial decisions for a multi-billion dollar corporation, were wrong to give Jamal the max. Clearly they didn't know what they were doing and somehow they just lucked into Jamal becoming exactly what the coach and front office said about him being able to become since his second year in the league.   That massive 9 figure, franchise changing, decision made by the people who have proven to make those decisions the best was a silly unnecessary gamble that they made stupidly. They couldn't have possible seen Jamal's progression coming, or had any idea what his time behind the scenes was showing them. With the trainers, with the coaches, in practices, on his own.  No, it is you, redditor, who knows how to evaluate talent and assign potential and a dollar value on it better than the people who have a career doing it. Not the people who are around this person every day to understand his personality and work ethic. Who are watching him in practices, in the gym, in games, concentrating on him with the knowledge that can only come from being a career long basketball player, coach, scout, executive.   No, they didn't make this decision accounting for everything you're looking at on basketball reference, everything they saw in games, and the metric ton of things they see that you can't see not to mention wouldn't be able to see.   It's you, basketball fan, who understands what's an unnecessary risk and gamble. Not these people who have spent their entire life around basketball in order to have a literal career doing that very thing; and the fact that they were completely correct in their decision, oh, it can only be a fluke. It couldn't possibly be that your ability to assess players is faulty and lacking. It's definitely the entire team of professionals, ex-players, and coaches who were wrong.  Incredible."
"pretty nervous of not having donovan given how poorly everyone but conley has been shooting  gotta have a big game from bojan/clarkson or both. in addition to mike and rudy of course  but we can win this game fasho, honestly all the players in the regular jazz rotation are good.   conley ingles oneale bojan gobert  ^ thats still a dope starting lineup without our young king"
Lonzo Ball  Paul George  Rudy Gobert  Jimmy Butler  Bam Adebayo
"There was this highlight I saw last year where three different players bailed going into the paint when they saw Rudy Gobert, I want that to be Mobley someday."
"rudy gay and eric paschall for small ball improved that. whiteside &gt; favors, basically gobert lite. stfu nerd."
Exactly lol telling KAT to post up more is like telling Rudy Gobert to start shootings more threes
"lol they added hassan whiteside, washed rudy gay, and eric paschall. at least 1-2 of them won't even be in the playoff rotation. + the jazz will never be real contenders with Gobert as their 2nd best player"
"I get what you are saying but that line of thinking goes so far into the abstract that it isn't really debatable. Same argument could be made for Ben Simmons or Rudy Gobert. If they put more in on the offensive side are they no longer in the debate for DPOY? I have no idea. I am not saying you are wrong, just that I can only go by what we have seen in the past. I am also not saying for sure he is the best, I am saying his level of defensive play in games is higher in my opinion which is backed by defensive numbers of blocks steals deflections, etc.   It gets even more complicated with  defense because all the great defenders tend to just have instinctual movements and awareness. I am reminded of Kawhi's steal not even watching the play, he just knew where to put his hand off pure instinct, that isn't able to be measured in stats it is just observed. Defense is also very team oriented, on ball defense with a rim protector is not the same as on ball defense without one."
The steiffel tower For the French center of Rudy Gobert
If the season ended lasted night and I was one of the voters... Or if the season kept going the way it's going for the rest of the year... I would vote for Steph Curry or Jimmy Butler but not Rudy Gobert. Keep in mind that I haven't watched any games with either of those players. As I really only watch the Bulls highlight videos.
"Rudy’s on/offs were insane last year. We were 19 pts per 100 possessions better with him in the floor than off, which was by far the best mark in the league. Even Lebron has only had that high of an on/off once in his career, though he’s been close several other times. Add in that the Jazz were the best team in the regular season and it’s a pretty concise case.   Fwiw most advanced stats (RAPTOR, LEBRON, EPM) painted the MVP race last year as a 2 person race between Jokic and Gobert with a lot of daylight between Rudy and #3."
Dude I will give you any odds you want on a rudy gobert MVP bet lol
"do you really think Rudy Gobert deserved MVP discussion over one of Jokic, Embiid, or Curry?"
"to be frank gobert should’ve been in the MVP conversation last year, at least a bit. clearly was jokic’s award by i think rudy was a top 3 candidate"
"Rudy Gobert is quite good as a screener and roller, right?"
On/off stats for 8 games are completely meaningless. Rudy Gobert currently has a defensive on/off of -11. Did he suddenly become the worst defender in the league? Any on/off splits right now are likely just 3 point shooting variance.   Also the Nuggets have been running 5 man bench units that have been getting absolutely plastered. Obviously that’s gonna pump up the on/off of their starters.
"Do not give this kid a pass. This is worrisome.  Fact is the rim didn't change and the ball didn't change, just the distance from 3 and the lack of dudes afraid to guard a large human playing point.  We should be worried about his ability to keep pace/conditioning, his general feel for the Offense, and adjusting to the dimensions of the court. Not scoring. The man should score. If the 3 isn't in your bag today, where's the floater? Can you even take guards and wings off the dribble? Can you get a bucket posting up a guard? Mid range is always an option. You gotta score to be on the floor. If Rudy Gobert averages double what you've scored in two games, you need serious help in the NBA."

Giannis went like 15th in that draft though. Rudy Gobert was way down there too.
"Ok but Its still a very strong indicator of defensive performance.   But lets take a more comprehensive look(also how do you reconcile Lebron being a bad defender with impact metrics painting him as a top 5 wing defender in 2020 as shown in the video? Are we straight up ignoring that now?)  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.nba.com/news/defensive-player-ladder-rudy-gobert-ben-simmons-maintain-leads%3famp=1  “But the Lakers lead the NBA in defensive rating (105.5) and James, already carrying such a load offensively, also leads the league in defensive win shares (0.179), topping both Conley (0.177) and Gobert (0.159). As for Davis, being out gets him a seat in the Ladder’s crowded green room of Top 5 candidates”  https://twitter.com/espnstatsinfo/status/1349763206776979458?s=21  “According to Second Spectrum, LeBron James has allowed opponents to shoot just 30% when he's the contesting defender, by far the best in the NBA. If you up the minimum to 100 FGA, James also ranks 1st in FG pct as the closest defender (36.0%) - on contested or uncontested shots.”"
48 Minutes of Rudy Gobert and Hassan Whiteside must seem like hell to opposing teams. So many guards just 'nope'ing out of drives this season.
"Utah Jazz All-Stars tonight:  Donovan Mitchell: 36 pts, 5-12 3s, 8 rbd, 6 ast  Mike Conley: 30 pts, 6-9 3s, 3 rbd, 2 ast  Rudy Gobert: 12 pts, 20 rbd, 4 blk"
i love rudy gobert
rudy fucking gobert  donovan fucking mitchell  mike fucking conley
‘One thing we don’t talk about enough is that Rudy Gobert is a really good screener’ -Utah jazz announcer
like Rudy Gobert?
"reminder that Trey Burke was a lottery pick taken ahead of: Giannis, CJ McCollum, Rudy Gobert, Tim Hardaway JR, Dennis Shroder and never averaged more than 12 PPG, with 6.6 PPG and 5.3 PPG in the last 2 seasons."
"As a fan of a team built around Rudy Gobert, this all sounds great."
Rudy Gobert would be putting up Bill Russell numbers except the numbers would actually count this time.
"I agree the team needs playmaking, I just don’t think it’ll come from them. It makes way more sense to make their best effort to acquire a playmaking point guard than it is to force two players into doing something we know they aren’t capable of doing. This would be like asking Rudy Gobert to start shooting threes at a high level instead of acquiring a shooter on the wings."
"I'm not sure what your point is there. A turnover is only worse than a missed shot in the context of a game, because turnovers lead to more points than a defensive rebound does. When looking at efficiency in a vaccuum, they're both comparable because it's an empty trip.   Again, I'm not sure what you're trying to prove saying that he was above average average in offensive rating. Know who the best player all time is considering offensive rating? Rudy Gobert. Kobe is 183. In fact, one of his highest offensive rating seasons was 05-06', where he shot more than 2.1K shots and got bounced in the first round. How does this show he was an effective scorer who would thrive in today's NBA?  And besides, it's an irrelevant stat because he scored the way he scored (lots of points on higher volume) in the era he was in. The argument is whether it would be more successful in the current NBA, which it's shown not to be. The guys you mentioned have had 0 success."
I think people need to understand that there’s a talent limit on players and they can’t simply become good at something just by practicing it. At some point expecting Jaylen Brown to become an effective passer will be like expecting Rudy Gobert to become a great 3 point shooter.
"Watch some of the warriors' games this season, it's obvious where Wiseman will play.    The warriors one loss this season, to Memphis, the turnovers were a big issue, Steph being triple teamed in the fourth and no one else being able to step up was a big issue, and Ja Morant being damn good at basketball was a big issue.    However, Steven Adams logging 10 first quarter points by BULLYING the warriors on the interior was a huge issue too.  The warriors struggled against the Lakers' bigs; did you see JTA trying to body AD?  That was ugly.  Zubic got what he wanted when the warriors played the Clippers.    The warriors, right now, have NO answer to big bodied 7 footers.  You know who you have to figure out if you want to win the western conference?  Jokic.  No one can stop him, but you need to slow him down.  Right now, with the warriors defense the way it is, they have zero answer for any of the huge bodied big men on other contenders.  You know who won the west last year?  Phoenix, the warriors have no answer for Dandre Ayton right now.    Wiseman doesn't have to win those matchups for the warriors to be significantly better, he just has to be better than Kevon Looney, whose giving up ridiculous amongst of height and reach to the behemoths of the west.  I love Loons, but he's not built to defend bully-ball centers, he's built to defend the Clint Capellas of the world.  Rudy Gobert, the center for the 5-1 Jazz, is way out of his paygrade.    Wiseman isn't developed enough to stop any of those guys either, but it will be harder to physically out-muscle a true 7 footer in the paint.  He just has to be able to do enough to tilt the outcome of the game a little.  The warriors are good already, it won't take much, but there's no way they are beating a team like Denver or Utah in the playoffs unless Wiseman is can play."
"Kevin Love is one of those players that no one actually watches so they just used say the same thing everytime they see his name on r/nba, just as an excuse to comment   Rudy Gobert is in this group too"
I love it for him and for us. Kid needs reps. It'll probably be good for him to get them when he's not going up against players like Rudy Gobert.
Don't those metrics also have Rudy Gobert as a top 5 player
"I dont think being all NBA is that big of an accomplishment during those years, there was no other big men worthy of those awards. His contemporaries around that time were Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Karl Anthony-Towns. Not exactly other future first ballot hall of famers. Getting voted to the all star game is the same thing, who cares about the center all star spot, his competition at the time was Rudy Gobert, someones whose entire future legacy will be based around covid.  Statistical leader doesnt mean anything either, Chris Kaman was a 20/10 player not to long ago, stats are easy on non-playoff teams.  Also I never said he was a bad player, only that his accomplishments rang really hollow because NO sucked, and the one time he did do something in the playoffs, it was off the back of Jrue playing at an incredible level."
"I know this list is based on current season performance, but still this list seems very wrong. If Rudy Gobert didn't even make the top 5 MVP candidates last season, when the Jazz had the best record in the league, what could he possibly do to win MVP this year?"
"It's so early that players like Rudy Gobert and Miles Bridges are legitimate talking points, which means its way too early."
Last season he was 10 in RAPTOR WAR and 6. in total RAPTOR behind Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley so that’s just more ignorance.
Rudy Gobert
"So your argument is that he missed the playoffs with a decent team? And that he led the league in scoring? He is supposed to lead the league in scoring. He brings literally nothing else to the table. He can’t run the offense and is a terrible defensive player. If he isn’t a top top scorer he is literally a negative on the court.  It’s also funny that his team last year was better than several of the teams harden regularly dragged to the playoffs yet somehow Curry is a top 3 player in the league when he does it, and Harden is a bum.  They have the same finals odds as the Utah Jazz. Is Rudy Gobert a top 3 player? The jazz roster is worse the gsw.   But hey no bias right?"
"This Jazz team might be good. Finally the Jazz have a backup center  Last year Favors looked washed, 2 years ago Bradley didn't even try to play defense. Whiteside is a perfect back up center to play when Gobert is on the bench  Also last year the Clippers won because the Jazz didn't play much perimeter defense. Since the Jazz added Paschall and Rudy Gay, that might not be a big problem"
"System, teammates, and technique clearly make a difference.  Being able to funnel your assignment baseline to Rudy Gobert is a lot easier than shutting down any and all penetration."
"My favorite part of all of your replies is you consistently ignore the new situation Russ is in. We've known for years Russ isn't all that efficient as a #1 option and, I haven't once even mentioned his efficiency. What I am remaining consistent about is how it is WAYYY too soon to judge Russ cause he is on a brand new team and role. But you just ignore the context entirely, despite me referencing back to the point.   Then you pull out some straw man argument out of your ass about Gobert? I'm also still confused on me asking you to clarify a stat that you posted is the equivalent of “Rudy Gobert is actually an amazing 3 point shooter. You can’t judge him just because he hasn’t taken or made a 3 in the first 7 games”  Surely EVEN YOU can see why that's illogical. Also gotta love how you keep creating hypothetical or fake 'quotes' to further attempt to prove your point lol. That seems like a HIGHLY effective to further a point. /s"
Steph Curry Jimmy Butler Kevin Durant Giannis Antetokounmpo Nikola Jokic  Ja Morant Paul George Miles Bridges Karl-Anthony Towns Joel Embiid  Lonzo Ball Derrick Rose John Collins Montrezl Harrell Rudy Gobert
"But dude, I’m not judging him based on 7 games. I’m judging him based on who he’s been as a player for *years* now.  The equivalent to your comment would be something like “Rudy Gobert is actually an amazing 3 point shooter. You can’t judge him just because he hasn’t taken or made a 3 in the first 7 games”. We know the 7 games are accurate because we’ve watched Gobert play for years and understand that he’ll never be a good shooter.  It’s the same thing with Westbrook. You’re basically saying “you can’t judge him on this season or the past 5 seasons. Just trust me, he’s actually an efficient player. It’s just 7 games”. Surely even you can see why that’s illogical."
"I think Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, and Tim Duncan, were all clearly better than him that whole time, and you could make an argument for Al Horford, Joakim Noah, and DeAndre Jordan too. Towards the tail-end of that time-frame, Anthony Davis and Rudy Gobert also surpassed him."
"Rudy Gobert is not targeted on defence in any way, shape or form."
"Remember, if Adams goes early that means not only does the trade go through but at 26 they would still need a center, so they probably go for Rudy Gobert instead of Arob"

Dude tried to take Rudy Gobert on 1v1.
Don’t need to read this post to know Rudy 12 points a game gobert isn’t an mvp candidate
They faced each other a total of 14 times in NBA games. Rudy Gobert has a 11-3 winning record over Giannis Antetokounmpo.
Rudy Gobert really just distracts you from the fact that Royce O'Neale is also on this team.
Rudy Gobert gets way too much credit; he's not altering any of Thanasis shots!
"&gt; Rudy Gobert who is at 25% but nobody accuses him of getting easy rebounds.  &gt; This is such an oversimplified and misleading assumption to make  Because this is low sample size. Gobert was at 37% last season, 36% the season before, and 39% prior. And this is lower than other centers because people are less likely to fight over a rebound with a 8 feet wingspan guy and run back on defense instead.   You didn't say anything important that I already didn't, all you did was cherry pick one guy on low sample size and make a false conclusion. The irony  &gt; ""Easy rebounds"" is one of the more stupid and lazy ways  There are such things as easy rebounds, doesn't matter if you dislike the concept or not."
"I did not say Gobert is not top 10 simply because his team lost.  I explained that players who are top 10 with the Jazz roster would take it to the Finals. The Jazz roster against last years Western Conference was enough for Embiid or AD on to get them out of the West last year. Their inside presence offensively would be so dominant with the ball handling and shooting around them and they can also serve as quality defensive anchors while being a bit better on the perimeter.   Gobert does not provide enough on the offensive to cover for flaws that a roster may have. Luka also took the clippers WITH kawhi to 7 with a worse roster than Utah and without very good perimeter defense. And those are the 3 guys ranked in the bottom of the top 10.  Also LeBron's Cavs team was also much much much worse than the Jazz roster which literally has another all-star and top 25 player next to Gobert. Lebron, literally made the Finals though. That's so much more than not ever getting past the second round lol.  But Who is Rudy Gobert better than out of these guys? Because that's the only conversation that matters when talking about top 10.  Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis.  I think there's seasons around 2013-2015 where Gobert these past two seasons could have been top 10 but he's not in this current NBA."
"This is such an oversimplified and misleading assumption to make. For one the reason centers have a higher percentage of contested rebounds is because they're fighting with other big men. And you're not accounting for defensive scheme; if you have a high threat transition offense the opposing team is less likely to contest for offensive rebounds in order to prevent easy fastbreak points. Not to mention the 23-27% range you have them listed as is basically middle of the pack, not low like how you are framing it to be. That puts them in the same league as Rudy Gobert who is at 25% but nobody accuses him of getting easy rebounds.  Y'all need to stop with trying to downplay the accomplishments of the players you don't like. ""Easy rebounds"" is one of the more stupid and lazy ways I've seen people criticize good rebounding players."

"Fwiw Rudy Gobert is averaging 18/18 and has as many offensive rebounds as turnovers and missed field goals combined (22). Mitchell’s shooting something like 38% from the field after today and the Jazz are still 4-1, which IMO should probably out Rudy in the convo but he’s just no the kind of player people will actually vote for."
Kyle “Rudy Gobert” Kuzma
What is his ceiling? A Rudy Gobert with better offense?
"Rudy Gobert last year had by virtually every advanced statistic the best defensive season in NBA history last year. He also lead the league in field goal percentage, plus minus, and on/off. While being on the best team in the league and having his co star miss a decent chunk of games.   He finished behind multiple players from a 41 win team. He’s better than your theoretical player as his efficiency and offensive rebounding make him a well above average offensive player. You cannot win MVP averaging less than 25 combined points+assists. Doesn’t matter if you’re the best player in the league, it’s just not how voting works."
"No. That dude WOULD be the MVP, 100%, defense matters, Rudy Gobert had like a top 6 impact last season and this hypothetical guy is way better than him, so he WOULD be the best player in the world, but... He simply wouldn't win because there's no precedent for it. There is a heavy precedent for scoring and playmaking to win, and MVP voters don't ever stray past their formula. There's simply no way it happens."
"&gt;The impact his defense creates is severely overrated as he can do nothing to stop the best offensive players.  Interior defenders are still the most impactful defender. Despite the invent of the 3pt-line obliteration, close-range 2s are still the most efficient way to score in basketball. Gobert happens to be the elite of the elite when it comes to defending the interior.   &gt;Furthermore he has easily the best supporting cast of all players.  The Jazz are a well-built team but you're exagerating here. Their best perimeter defender is Royce O'Neil(?) After that, there are bunch of negative neutral defenders. That's why theyir defense is so reliant on Rudy. The clippers were able to expose the coverages they use because their guys couldn't stop penetration before kicking it out to one of the Clippers better shooters.   &gt;No one is hating on Gobert we are just acknowledging his very real faults, and that individual defense is not nearly as impactful as individual offense.  Speak for yourself. Gobert is easily one of the most hated in the league. First for the perception of him being soft with the all-star snub, then with the COVID league-hiatus, and now because many can't accept that he's among the most awarded defensive players in league history. Even in this thread you can see people shitting on him as if he isn't an extremely impactful player."
"It’s Rudy, and frankly by a pretty decent margin. Gobert’s offense might look awkward and gangly but he’s the most efficient player of all time (by true shooting) by a decent margin and he scores at nearly double the rate Draymond does.   Green does a lot of playmaking for sure, but Rudy also opens up a lot of offense for others with his screens. Every time it gets brought up Jazz fans get mocked, but it’s a very real part of basketball and Gobert’s probably the best in the league at it.   What makes the difference is Gobert averages about 2.5 more ORBs per game, and also is top 5 in the league in fouls drawn, which helps us get into the bonus. And frankly the biggest gap is in spacing. Gobert provides either league best or close to it vertical spacing and is constantly occupying the attention of multiple defenders, which makes the offense easier for everyone else. Green is a PF that’s a 30% career 3pt shooter, and even though he’s learned how to not have that cripple his offense that’s still not ideal for any team’s spacing.   Rudy Gobert is the #1 reason the Jazz have the leagues best offense so far despite being a below average 3 point shooting team so far while being first in 3 point attempt rate."
"gobert should be scoring more too, I remember watching him against the sixers calling for the ball over and over again when drummond was out of the game because they had zero size on the court and gobert was a mismatch for their entire team.   but for some reason they kept giving it to clarkson to chuck from the outside  maybe it benefits the jazz more overall if clarkson finds his form but rudy could have put up 30+ points that game if they were actually feeding him inside"
"You seem to think I’m trying to say that Steph isn’t having a great year. This is not the case. Steph is playing phenomenal basketball, I don’t think anyone can really disagree with that assessment.  What I AM saying is that you provided a stat to bolster your argument that Steph was playing All-NBA level defense, and I’m saying the stat you used is terrible. Do you also think DeMar DeRozan is a top 10 defender? Do you think there are 50 better defenders than Rudy Gobert? If you say no, then you agree it’s a bad stat. And if you say yes, then that’s a hot take I don’t really have the fortitude to comprehend at this present moment."
"But if he plays with Gobert you get... Rudy Gay? No, wait."
So basically you play with Rudy Gobert in the lineup you’ll have a good defensive?

I absolutely read this as Rudy Gobert and thought I was missing history.
"Lots of positives from tonight for sure, excellent ball movement, Gay being like Paschall but actually good, Rudy being a bully on both ends.  Still a little disheartening to see Mitchell and Gobert inexplicably have literally zero chemistry in the pick and roll despite playing together for 5 years. Theoretically it should work but it just doesn’t."
I read this as Rudy Gobert and I was very confused for a sec lol
I thought that said Rudy Gobert for a second…
"Rudy Gobert has a career high of 35, John Stockton’s career high is 34."
Yeah like Cole Anthony has swag. Mo bamba got a 300 million views+ song about him. Isaac didn't kneel for the anthem so he got some heat.   The pacers are just hey we made headlines for myles turner getting hugged by Rudy gobert
&gt;Miami lost because he wouldn't take an open shot. They beat Milwaukee the year before playing him at C. It's not like it's automatically a losing strategy to play him at C in the playoffs otherwise Markieff Morris starting at center wouldn't have dominated Rudy Gobert  He wouldn't take an open shot because he couldn't get to his spots. I mean at this point you just sound like a homer refusing to admit the faults of your players.
"Miami lost because he wouldn't take an open shot. They beat Milwaukee the year before playing him at C. It's not like it's automatically a losing strategy to play him at C in the playoffs otherwise Markieff Morris starting at center wouldn't have dominated Rudy Gobert.   What you're describing is the definition of a center in 2001, not 2021.   If you can play center for an entire regular season two years in a row you're a center. It's not that complicated"

Gobert shoulda never been an all star. No one watches an all star game for rudy fuckin yogurt
"Westbrick, Rudy Gobert, Jaylen Brown, Jrue, Towns, Julius Randle."
"I can easily think of 30 players better than Simmons (I'll exclude Embiid from the list)  In no real order: 1. Lebron 2. KD 3. Giannis 4. Curry 5. Luka 6. Jokic 7. Harden 8. PG 9. Cp3 10. Kawhi 11. AD 12. Lillard 13. Tatum 14. Zion 15. Butler 16. Beal 17. Trae Young 18. Donovan Mitchell 19. KAT 20. Zach Lavine 21. Booker 22. Bam 23. Jaylen Brown 24. Jrue Holiday 25. SGA 26. Ja Morant 27. Rudy Gobert 28. Middleton 29. DeRozan 30. LaMelo Ball  Also Kyrie Irving if he actually wanted to play basketball  There is probably some you could make arguments for one way or the other and obviously fit comes into play so I doubt they're trying to trade for say Rudy Gobert, but I also probably forgot some players you could add to this list as well.  That being said you're also probably not getting a 1 for 1 trade for Simmons with the current situation. So I guess you hold out and hope the situation improves"
"agreed, in a vacuum and in terms of player value i think he’s worth a lot more than that, but the Jazz FO knows that having Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, and Ben Simmons as your 3 max players is not a championship caliber team"
"&gt;Stop comparing two players base off advanced stats. When every non curry man knows its bs. Rudy gobert better then curry.  No one is saying advanced stats have to be the only argument, but obviously they mean something. Rudy Gobert did lead the league in a bunch of plus minus stats last season, does that mean he's the best player in the league? No, it's also affected by the quality of players around him and luck too, but it definitely means he's alot more impactful than most people believe. It's also important how reliable the stats you're using are, defensive rating is a very bad stat, and just looking at raw RAPM for a single year is definitely going to be unreliable. But if for multiple years, Curry beats Kobe in most or all advanced stats it should tell you something.  &gt;Your reaching and kobe has won defensive teams without shaq. And players have said he is the hardest to go up against.  Some of those defensive teams were undeserved, even Phil Jackson admitted that at one point. Most advanced stats show the Kobe was only a slight positive defender for most of his career and not one of the best in the league. If you'd rather not just look at advanced stats, there's also this [breakdown](https://youtu.be/Jopi5e46PAY) Also, when he really did peak defensively and deserved those all defense teams, he was early in his career. In other words his defensive peak and offensive peak weren't at the same time.   &gt;Luca doncic led the nba in double teams last year Also looked it up for you. Curry isn't in top 10 this year in being double teamed. It's just a false impression base off highlights. Ja morant is being doubled the most.  That stat was only for on ball double teams, curry is mostly an off ball player. Almost everyone who watches curry agrees he draws more defensive attention than any player in the league"
So the exact same thing Rudy Gobert has been doing in the regular season the last 4-5 years?
I'd go with:  1. Draymond Green  2. Bam Adebayo  3. Rudy Gobert
"I think A.d. would work better with Rudy gobert. He's a juiced up javal Mcgee and Dwight Howard since he doesn't like playing  the 5 often.   Giannas and Jokic would be crazy with Murray running the offense or Middleton.   I got Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, giannas and jokic.   Dennis Schroder,  Mitchell ,  Joe Ingles . A.d. gobert"
"It normally is though. Rudy Gobert, giannis, and Dwight won because they are shot blockers. They, including Myles, alter all traffic thinking about coming down the lane. Take Myles off the court and the Pacers are easily the worst defensive team in basketball"
I'd take just Brogdon and let Maxey run the 2nd unit. Maxey could also be a matchup dependent 2 guard if you felt like their rim protection was weak because that dude will get you buckets if he beats his guy off the dribble and you don't have like Rudy Gobert back there waiting for him.
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"Let's stop this biasness towards Curry. Stop comparing two players base off advanced stats.  When every non curry man knows its bs. Rudy gobert better then curry. He finished first seed last year with a higher efg% ? With a higher defensive rating and defensive player of the year ?    &gt;Defensively, Kobe surely was better but playing with O'Neal helped, I think.  Your reaching and kobe has won defensive teams without shaq. And players have said he is the hardest to go up against.    &gt;start thinking that Curry is at the same level as his, at least. He is a whole offensive system on his own, has changed the game  Curry is on the same level. He's an all time great and generational player. No he's not a whole offensive system on his own. Basketball is a team sport. Draymond green facilities or sets high pick screens and curry roll to a side open to shoot off ball.   Same way the triangle offense was ran by kobe and a low post scorer to create spacing for his mid ranges, and cuts.   &gt;No one is being double or tripled teamed with the same consistency  Luca doncic led the nba in double teams last year Also looked it up for you. Curry isn't in top 10 this year in being double teamed. It's just a false impression base off highlights. Ja morant is being doubled the most.   Kobe was getting doubled team the most though and also during pick up games bruh...."
where is the rudy gobert slander? post is dogshit
Rudy Gobert will be a HOFer when all is said and done. Best defensive center since Big Ben.
"In honor of the Staples center name change, here’s the All Ugly-Ass NFT Ape Twitter Avatar Team, or the Right-Click Save-As Superstars.   PG: Steph Curry SG: Seth Curry SF: Tyrese Halliburton  PF: Josh Hart C: Rudy Gobert  GM’ed by Daryl Morey.   All these players have NFT avatars on Twitter.  Obviously this team is incredibly small, but that’s only fitting for such a forward-looking group. I could’ve used Tobias Harris at the 4 but I wanted to take them from all different teams for varieties sake."
Draymond Green NOT Rudy Gobert is this generations best defender.

"Since Dennis no way lol, Timmy/Garnett/Wallace/Mutombo/Howard are all greater than him. Best is another discussion, especially if you consider the body he has, he has a shot at the most skillful defender ever. But he clearly doesn't have the resume to even have an argument above those players And Rudy Gobert"
So you would rather have Rudy Gobert being iso'd against the best players in the league than Tucker because of his awards?
Hakeem/Tim Duncan/Kevin Garnett/Rudy Gobert/Ben Wallace/Alonzo Mourning/Mutombo (and Draymond for that metter) are clearly better defenders than Dennis Rodman.
"You can only evaluate them based on how they compare with their peers. Projecting how their careers would've gone if they were in today's NBA leads to a level of theorycrafting that ultimately goes nowhere (what if they had modern training methods, nutrition, watched tape of past players, etc). If you put Rudy Gobert in the 60s he's be a worse version than his current self because he wouldn't have learned a lot of the skills he currently has because the people who invented those techniques would not have invented them yet."
"All that can be true while simultaneously acknowledging the rudy wasn’t very good on that end either, Ty Lue even willfully admitted that he was actively targeting Gobert on defense. Likely because getting Gobert into defensive rotations against a 5 out offense will always yield strong shot quality, bigs like him just don’t have the foot speed to defend in those situations   Anyways this is more than just one season, this is 4 straight years. Again even when he had strong perimeter defenders the Jazz suffered from the same defensive issues. If it happened just in 2021 then maybe but 4 years?"
Legit DPOY too not a Rudy gobert DPOY
"Bruh, Rudy Gobert has had talented perimeter defenders on his team in the past. He had Crowder, Exum, Rubio, O’neal etc. He was still routinely targeted by high level offenses and his defensive metrics in the playoffs dropped significantly  Its not even his fault per say, its just the playoffs in the modern nba are where drop coverage big go to die. Guys like Draymond have infinitely more value in the playoffs because their versatility is next level. Same for Giannis, AD, Bam, Simmons and even an engaged Lebron"
"Just had a quick look.. Rudy Gobert at 27. Obviously, Giannis at 15 as well."
I'll subscribe to Rudy Gobert is getting the first Jazz regular season triple double since 2008 on points/rebounds/blocks
Put Rudy Gobert in the 60’s and we’d be calling him the goat
"Whenever I tell people Draymond is a better defender then Rudy Gobert. They act as if I’m crazy, Dray is the greatest defender in the league since Dennis Rodman"
"I can kind of understand the idea of isoing against Gobert since there's no rim protection behind him, but at this point he's probably Utah's best perimeter defender other than Royce. It just isn't a mismatch having Rudy on the perimeter unless you want a pull-up 3."
Let’s not pretend that Gobert is winning DPOY because of highlights. Even by the advanced/impact numbers Gobert was a monster regular season defender. Playoffs is another situation but in the regular season Rudy is a deserving DPOY in the years he won it.
Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Trae Young  Rudy Gobert  Karl-Anthony Towns
"Cause replace Rudy with a versatile DPOY and none of that shit happens. Ben Wallace had a worse defensive roster around him in Chicago yet led his team to the conference finals. Same shit with Dwight to the finals. You think if you replace Rudy w a guy like Draymond they still blow that series?  Gobert is a great defender. Yet he has weaknesses that are magnified with weak defensive help. Many many DPOYs dont have that issue, hes not versatile enough."
"[Dispelling Myths Around Gobert’s Defense](https://saltcityhoops.com/dispelling-myths-aroung-goberts-defense/)  &gt; Myth #1: Gobert can’t guard on the perimeter  &gt; Let’s start with isolation defense. This year, there were 87 players that guarded at least 50 isolations. **If mainstream highlight reels are your source of information here, you’d expect to see Rudy at the bottom of the pack. Actually, the opposite is true**. Gobert allows the seventh fewest points per possession (PPP). Opponents score an average of 0.71 points per isolation when Gobert is defending. **That’s less than Simmons (0.73), Anunoby (0.76), Bam Adebayo (0.78), Mikal Bridges (0.97), Giannis Antetokounmpo (1.06), Clint Capela (1.07), and Myles Turner (1.08)**. Gobert also allows the third lowest scoring frequency (30.6%), the eighth lowest FG% (32%), and the fourth lowest FT throw frequency (4.7%) when guarding opponents in isolation.  Wait, so you don't think having 4 other meh to poor defenders on your team would contribute to a DPOY centre getting dunked on? How do you think an offensive player gets a chance to dunk on Gobert? They have to first get downhill into the paint, which would mean they blow by their defender in isolation (which happens a lot for the Jazz) or through handoffs/screens. If you have bad defenders, do you think it makes it easier or harder for a player to get into the paint with enough freedom to go up and dunk on a 7'1 DPOY centre? And do you think having bad defenders would hold up an offensive player long enough for a big man to get into help position and ready up for a good contest vs being late on the contest? Defense is a team game, not even Rudy Gobert can single handedly cover up all the issues with the Jazz's defense, issues that aren't on him but his teammates and the coaching staff having a defensive system that is ""let Rudy Gobert just clean up your fuck ups""."
"&gt; In impact entries that take on and off court splits in addition to box scores stats into account he was top 5 in the the postseason from 2015-19.  Can you share any non-cumulative ones of these so we can look over them to see if that's measuring how valuable Draymond is as a singular player, compared to his value compared to the player replacing him in the Warriors scheme?   &gt; ""aNd NevEr HaS bEeN"" it was literally the most valuable skill in the league for 30 years. You know one player won 11 rings off the back off of his defence.  Which 30 years were those? Because defense was, uh, not particularly existent in the 50s and 60s. Even when you're speaking of Bill Russell and those Celtics teams, they were constantly at the top of the league in PPG and played at the highest pace in the 60s. The only reason why they didn't have the #1 ORTG every season was because of that insane pace leading to, well, more questionable shots than usual. Even by those standards.  You could make the argument that it was their defense that allowed them to have such a high scoring offense I suppose but that's pretty cyclical. I mean look at the 63 East Finals against a lousy defensive team in the Royals.   Game 1: **Royals 135** Celtics 132  Game 2: **Celtics 125** Royals 102  Game 3:** Royals 121** Celtics 116 Game 4:** Celtics 128** Royals 110  Game 5: **Celtics 125** Royals 120  Game 6: **Royals 109** Celtics 99  Game 7: **Celtics 142** Royals: 131   Or what about the 66 Finals vs. the Lakers?   Game 1:** Lakers 133** Celtics 129  Game 2: **Celtics 129** Lakers 109  Game 3: **Celtics 120** Lakers 106  Game 4: **Celtics 122** Lakers 117  Game 5: **Lakers 121** Celtics 117  Game 6: **Lakers 123** Celtics 115  Game 7: **Celtics 95** Lakers 93  Russell, Havlicek, and Sam averaged 23 a piece, West and Baylor averaged 34 and 25 respectively. I implore you to go watch some tape from the 50s and 60s and try to come away with the opinion that defense was the premier skill and reason for winning back then. Hell I'd say stamina was more of a factor for winning then than defense, considering it was just a track meet up and down the court every game.  &gt; Draymond performed like a low level MVP candidate in his prime  He has only had votes casted for him one time in his entire career. That was the 15-16 record season setting where he came in 7th and his teammate, Steph Curry, was the unanimous MVP. Because Mike Fratello and John Denton had him aas their #2 MVP. Denton who had Avery Bradley as his #2 in DPOY voting, case the sole 6th man vote for...Allen Crabbe... Fratello who had LMA and Pau Gasol on his All-NBA 1st team. Cmon now. Even Draymond said in an interview he couldn't believe he got those two votes.  You are conflating the value that Draymond receives from being on some of the greatest teams of all time compared to his actual standalone value. No doubt he is a big part of those teams, but to suggest his standalone value as a player is anywhere near the quality of an MVP is past even the most fervent of fandom takes. I like Draymond as a player, a lot. He does truly unique things. If you put him on any other team besides the Warriors his value drops off a cliff. If you put any other ""MVP"" players on a different team, ever, their value does not change much.   You would have to suggest that Draymond is account for 20+ points negated on defense alone to have the same standalone impact as an MVP caliber player, which would be by far the most of all time by lightyears.  By every single defensive metric you're going to find, Rudy Gobert is a more impactful defender than Draymond Green. In fact Gobert has a number of the best defensive seasons of all time. Rudy had the highest DRAPTOR rating of all time last year at +8 going back to 77. The highest DRPM since 1996. #1 and #3 DEPM seasons since 04. DLEBRON says he has the #1 and #4 best defensive seasons of all time. He has the single season record for most team points allowed since 06-07.   This was all last season.  So by every ""impact"" and ""performance"" metric there is, the solid ones or as solid as you can be since defensive metrics are kinda meh, Gobert is a vastly superior defender than Draymond, and last season might have been the best defensive season of all time. Did you feel like he was an MVP candidate? Was he even a low-level candidate? Probably not something you had ever considered and you might not consider it right now either.   &gt; AD is no doubt a better scorer but most most of his championship equity outside of that single bubble run (because he was shooting like 40% on 3s and 60% on midrange Js) comes as a defender as he isn't effective as a scorer in isolation or a playmaker, (which isn't the case with Draymond as he is an excellent passer).  First of all let's not undersell that first point.   Draymond's best scoring season was on the 73 win warriors where he scored 14 points a game on 49/39/68. Excluding this season he would never average over 45% from the floor again or over 30% from 3 again. Nor did he before that. No doubt Draymond is a better passer, that's part of his role in that offense because he cannot score at an NBA level. He averages 5 more assists a game than AD for his career.  AD is not used as a passer even if he is better than we think because he is an elite scorer. He is the guy people like Draymond pass the ball to. He is on a streak of 9 straight 20+ ppg seasons. 7 of which are over 24 points. 4 of which are over 26. 2 of which are over 28. Obviously on much better efficiency than Draymond from every shooting location that is tracked. He's not just a better scorer. Most years he double or triples Draymond's scoring.   Even considering Draymond's elite positional passing and being on historic offenses he only cracks the top 20 of OWS once. That 15-16 outlier season for him where he was 10th. AD is top 20 6 times, and top 5 4 times.   Draymond has never been top 20 in OBPM. Anthony Davis has not only been top 20 6 times but he is 14th overall in NBA history by that measure.  The levels of value on offense that AD is greater than Draymond, even when Draymond sits on these historic offensive teams that are the absolute perfect positions for him imaginable in all of NBA history, are staggering. They cannot even be mentioned in the same breath. Draymond is like if you fused a non-rebounding Dennis Rodman with a non-scoring Andre Miller. AD is one of the greatest scorers in NBA history.   &gt; most of his championship equity outside of that single bubble run (because he was shooting like 40% on 3s and 60% on midrange Js) comes as a defender as he isn't effective as a scorer in isolation or a playmaker, (which isn't the case with Draymond as he is an excellent passer).  First of all let me make it clear. I don't care about championships in this discussion, nor do I think it's particularly relevant when assessing the individual talent of players. Especially in this case however, because there is no case that Draymond is a #1, 2, or 3 offensive option on his team--so there isn't a discussion to be had like Jokic vs. AD wherein you can suggest Jokic is that extra level better because he's a true all game #1 option that leads to winning.   As Gilbert Arenas said in regards to the 75th Anni List redo he did, ""Championships are the cherry on top of the sundae, stats, all-nbas, all-stars, individual achievements are the sundae. Championships are just this extra thing on top of that to be a tie breaker or a nudge over the edge.""   So while AD did go crazy in the bubble, and conspiratorial as it may be I think that he and the Lakers got some serious help from the refs, it's not like it was some outlier among outliers like Draymond 15-16 season. Certainly his bubble run (28/10/3.5/1/1.5 on 57/38[3 attempts]/73) was better than his other playoff seasons (31/11/2/1/3 on 54/00/89 and 31/13/2/2/2 on 52/27[2 attempts]/83) shows he is still an elite playoff performer. In fact when you account for the fact he was on wildly worse teams than that LA team in 15 and 18 where teams could double and swarm him all game, compared to a Lakers team with LeBron and shooters, and the fact that most shooters got hot in that bubble, it's even less of a staggering outlier.  As far as being effective as a scorer in isolation in 19-20 AD was in the 71st percentile for isolation scorers. Not elite but certainly not ineffective. That was better than players like Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and around the same as Jason Tatum and CP3.   As you can imagine Draymond is in the no-percentile on that because they would never isolate Draymond. Additionally playmaking is more than assists, which Draymond is an elite passer especially for his position but he is not a good playmaker.   Playmaking is not passing, that's just one component of it. Playmaking comes from being a threat to get places on the court to score or pass.  The more of those places and the more ways you can do that, the better a playmaker you are. The play part of playmaking is there for a reason, and there are many more plays than a pass. Otherwise we'd call it a passmaker. Draymond isn't a threat to score, he isn't a threat for the defense to collapse in on, his passing comes from passing to people off screens or when the defense makes a mistake because his IQ is great. It also comes from his elite 2 man game with Curry, the best shooter of all time who is going to convert a lot of those assists. But a playmaker he is not.   &gt; Its the same with Giannis and Embiid as well. Their scoring is brilliant but their value in the postseason comes from their standout defence.  No. It comes from both. I don't even really understand how you can come to the conclusion that their value in the postseason comes from their standout defense more than their scoring, let alone the sole value.   Continued:"
Rudy Gobert is an All-NBA player you dummy.
&gt;Prime Dwight today would be Rudy govern. Is that an all nba player?  Do you mean 4x All NBA Center Rudy Gobert?
If u drop Dwight in the league today he’s Rudy gobert. And nobody is arguing that Rudy is top 75
Prime Dwight was way better than Rudy Gobert. That’s a silly take.
"That wasn't Rudy's fault, it was the other 4 players on the court with him not being able to guard their man, fight over screens, rotate to the open man, drop down to help effectively or even at the bare minimum stay on their mans hip to atleast contest a little bit. Instead, Gobert was left on an island in no mans land. If he doesn't help on the drive, that's an open layup. If he does help, that opens up an easy kick out for three. In both cases, it looks like Gobert fucked up when in reality, it is a failing of the defense as a whole, a defense that Gobert pretty much carries on his back. If they take Rudy out, the Jazz's defense gets even worse, not better. If you replace Gobert with another big man, that defense gets worse as well."
I mean the truly elite playmakers are also elite scorers  obviously I would take Rudy Gobert over Lonzo Ball but due to not having scoring gravity he doesn't crack the top echelon of playmakers
Rudy Gobert or Ricky Rubio
An elite defender can’t guard 5 people on the court. An elite playmaker can make things happen for 5 people on the court.  Defense wins championships. But it can’t be just one guy (see Rudy Gobert and the Jazz).
&gt;Gobert is and has been better than mitchell  Did you watch the playoffs last yr? Rudy isn't better than Mitchell
"I think what you said about scheming defense that way is key. I found, like you said, KP was at his best as a help defender flying in late for the block, like prime Serge Ibaka used to do from the weak side. For whatever reason, he never quite fit as the sort of anchor of the defense, hanging out in the paint and deterring potential drivers, like Roy Hibbert that one year or a younger Rudy Gobert, or as the guy tasked with bodying up bigs. I think he’s more of an early 2010’s 4, defensively, and less of a classic 5."
Rudy Gobert. Dude went from around a 0.72 to currently being at 1 FT/FGA.  Combination of teams having more fouls to spend on stopping him from going up under the rim and hacking him for intentional fouls.
When he hit Rudy Gobert with 4 pump fakes to foul him out at the end of regulation
Is Rudy Gobert secretly the worst rebounder in the league?
"My favorite part of ants game is when he takes 7 footers to the basket. Guys like rudy gobert, zubac. It's amazing"
"3 time DPOY Rudy Gobert gets abused every playoffs, so whats your point?"
"I see people use the phrase “played off the court” a lot in regards to gobert. It’s insane to me. He has kind of a goofy style, and sometimes when he’s mad or he’s showing off, he kind of reminds me of a middle school kid. But the dude is absolutely the most imposing defender in the nba. The way he hedges and channels opposing players is immensely impactful, even though he would get better individual stats by being more aggressive. He’s brilliant in that way. Im also quite sure that if Utah schemed for him more offensively that he’d easily be a 20-25 ppl guy, but for some reason, they don’t. I don’t know if it has to do with purely basketball reasons, or if scheming more touches for Donovan is part of building a brand or something… Maybe it’s better for business to have two stars, so they focus more on Don on offense, but I really think that more touches for Rudy on offense would equate to more Ws. But hey, I’m just a casual, commenting on the things casuals says that get my goat. People who think rudy is overrated generally look at a couple of poster dunks over him and use those anecdotes to impugn his game. I’m sure that any gm in the league would take his $200m contract in a heartbeat. Possibly the best bargain in the NBA imho."
"The system not fitting him doesn’t explain his ineptitude at the free throw line-thats effort. Even Rudy Gobert is almost passable now because he’s worked on it. Ben hasn’t, and it shows that he really hasn’t put in the work anywhere."
Wilt would be such an amazing tool to build around in the modern game. Imagine vpluke scoring Rudy gobert with slick post moves and an incredible fadeaway. In terms of passing he clearly has the ability...a good coach to teach him how to do it more effectively and he'd be even more absurd
"Tbh Brook Lopez was stretch big, albeit not too efficient he's better shooter than most NBA C. A much better example would be to see Rudy Gobert vs Wembanyama 1on1, where Rudy just easily drains 3 after 3. Rudy is not even a midrange threat in the NBA"
I have a buddy who just keeps telling me “Rudy Gobert is only in the league because he’s really tall. He’s not actually good.”
"Rudy Gobert has his off nights, but it’s no coincidence that he’s a 3 time DPOY. Casuals push him off but Gobert is actually way good"
Need to see that Rudy Gobert scuffle with Dedmon again. You've spent two games in a row deliberately trying to start something. Cmon man
rudy gobert could take entire teams with his bear hugs
"They brought in Rudy Gay as a solution to small ball but he's injured.  They brought Whiteside in to replace Favors to rectify the fact that the Jazz had the biggest gap in the league in defensive rating when Gobert was on the court vs on the bench, and it's working."
"If the Warriors keep winning, Draymond will win it.  Embiid.and Turner have a real chance too.  They won't give Gobert a fourth unless there's not another option.  It puts him on a tie for the most ever.  I'm not saying it's correct but the playoff Rudy narrative will push votes to other players if it can reasonably be argued."
"He can guard the perimeter, not elite. Ben Simmons is an elite perimeter defender  He is gives you some rim protection because he is tall. Rudy Gobert is an elite rim protector.  Being positive at both these things don’t make you an elite defender  He is does not have elite versatility either, can realistically only guard 3,4 and some 5s  He is not an elite passer or playmaker, CP3 is an elite playmaker.  I love kev but you’re overrating him"
If Duncan played now he’d be a poor mans rudy Gobert with a decent jumper
“Say what you want about Rudy Gobert…”  Rudy Gobert smells like soggy cereal
Also advanced stat god Rudy Gobert (but only half of him)
"Rudy Gobert, Frenchman."
"What an idiot trying to gatekeep peoples emotions. In the heat of the moment people POSTURE then use their better judgement to NOT actually fight. FUCK Rudy Gobert lmao what a tool, shutup and standup for something real like Enes Kanter"
I feel like this would carry a lot more weight if Rudy Gobert wasn’t the one saying it 😂😂😂
Rudy Gobert has an on off of -14.4 so far this season   Rudy Gobert bad?????
"Nah Rudy Gobert is better - Jazz fans, probably"
Rudy Gobert is a fucking loser.
"Case in point. Rudy Gobert.   The way the game has evolved, there’s more value in versatility and multi dimensional defensive skill. Than just living in the paint."
"I agree with Rudy Gobert. It won't stop until someone on the court gets checked! I never liked Former Commissioner David Stern. I can't deny the approach he took was ""proper""! I believe none of what's going on in the NBA today would happen if Stern were still here."
"Yeah, but does Rudy Gobert get assigned to Steph, Ja, Beal, Lavine?   There aren't really guys in the league who can lock down the best players in the league 1 through 5, but there are guys who can make those bad match ups less of a disadvantage when they happen.  But, to counter, Rodman could probably defend guys like Giannis, Kawhi, LeBron and other oversized/super-athletic wings that become match up nightmares in crunch time and in the playoffs better than anyone in the league today. And even if he wasn't *the best* at defending those guys, he'd be good enough to be in the conversation while also being able to defend guys like Jokic and Embiid. He'd provide immense versatility on the defensive end that very few guys could.  The only person I could see potentially being better is Giannis, honestly. But as you pointed out, Rodman wasn't asked to do a lot offense, so he had more energy for the defensive end of the court."
"Jrue literally got switched onto Rudy gobert in an Olympic game and in that same sequence he denied Rudy the ball, found a way to box him out after someone else shot the ball, then proceeded to get the board over Rudy. I can’t think of another guard that is capable of a defensive sequence like that."
Rudy needs to get some of that fake toughness maybe it will help him against his opponent. No player is afraid of Gobert he lacks even fake toughness lmao
[Rudy boxing post covid](https://sports.yahoo.com/rudy-gobert-jazz-return-gym-coronavirus-pandemic-042648171.html)  [Rudy boxing some time before](https://www.nba.com/watch/video/2018/12/06/20181206-rudy-goberts-love-boxing)
"Wait so Rudy Gobert boxes too? Jfc as if being a brick wall of a man wasn’t enough😂😂 I really hope someone pushes him enough to feel threatened. We saw how far Morris slid on the wood after getting checked by Jokic, how far would someone slide after getting a face punch from boxer Rudy Gobert?"
Nate Robinson vs Rudy Gobert   THE REDEMPTION ARC
yeah rudy gobert is definitely going to risk breaking a hand or some other injury to 'take it off the court and deal with it as men'
"The whole thing started because Turner blocked Gobert, so Rudy went to the ground and grabbed Turners shorts and tried to pull him down too. Turner got pissed and shoved Rudy, and then Rudy hugged Turner until it was broken up, and now apparently is calling out OTHER people for being fake right guys lol"
"""Meet me in Temecula.""  -Rudy Gobert"
"Rudy ""Forget Jokić, I'm the captain now"" Gobert"
2020 is a prime example for why it’s important to have it for the whole season. The season suddenly ended from Rudy Gobert touching a microphone for a lot of teams
"Question is, is Rudy Gobert about that life though?"
"Yeah there really isn't a single NBA team where they don't immediately get better if you add Klay. I think he's the worst player where that's still true. Obviously any team gets better when you add a top 5 player, fit is irrelevant with talent levels like Harden or LBJ. But even some all-stars aren't a lock to improve your team. I love Kemba, but there are a number of teams that wouldn't be better with him. Same is true for Rudy Gobert and a number of others."
Why in the world does Rudy Gobert own an entire metropolis of real estate in Shaq's head?
"Rudy Gobert's contract vs Shaq's: https://i.imgur.com/uQDavcP.png  If you use inflations calculators, which don't really give a perfect picture, then Shaq's best contract year 2004-05 he made 37 million in ""todays"" money. Not at all unfair to say Rudy Gobert is getting paid more than Shaq."
Is Rudy Gobert the worst player to ever play the game of basketball?  All the threads I have seen on him lately have been about him.
I find Rudy Gobert to be extremely offensive
"It sounds more like Shaq has gotten to Rudy. Shaq is literally clowning the guy, Baguette Biyombo is hilarious, all Rudy has to say is ""there is no beef"" lol. If you think one of the greatest of all time who has made more than Rudy's contract twice over in his lifetime feels offended by Rudy Gobert, I think you're completely misreading the situation"
"Well considering Shaq was one of the most dominant big men of all time, NBA MVP, 4x Champion, 3x Finals MVP with many All NBA selections and Defensive team selections he 100% has the right to clown Rudy Gobert. Hopefully what Shaq manages to do is ignite a fire in Gobert which results in Gobert continuing the elevate his game. Personally I think it's great when a legend of the game calls out a new student to bring more. It's the kind of thing that's healthy for a competitive league."
"Yeah all the work he did last year helping raise money for Kobe’s foundation, getting youth sports teams equipment to play this year, and the Christmas gifts for the Boys and Girls clubs didn’t happen right? He focused completely on beefing with Rudy Gobert and that’s all."
"Drummond sucks man, he’s always been terrible efficiency wise. Some of it is Mose Malone style misses that he tips back it but most of it is him just having no touch around the basket and not understanding how to put himself into position to make clean looks like your Rudy Gobert/Tyson Chandlers of the world"
"Oh yes one image completely proves that Jokic is a bad overall defender. Those drop coverages were part of the team’s plan to contain the paint against the Jazz. Rudy Gobert isn’t a shooting threat so clearly the nuggets coaching staff thought it would be better for Jokic to drop. That isn’t his fault. The return of Gary Harris was testament to where the team’s real defensive problems were. Regardless, we can talk weaknesses and strengths all day. For example, Jokic’s craftiness in the post and playmaking singlehandedly won them the Clippers series which is not something AD would have been able to replicate."
You can simultaneously hold the opinions that:  1. The Jazz were right to sign Rudy Gobert 2. Rudy Gobert is overpaid 3. Rudy Gobert is a very good player 4. Rudy Gobert had a bad showing yesterday  And your comments can reflect these things on a given day
&gt;Again how does Utah improve by not re-signing Gobert?  They dont have Rudy Gobert on their books for 200 million dollars and 5 years.
"It's the self-fulfilling small market mindset. ""We have to massively overpay our players, we don't sign superstars."" And then oh look, you can't trade for a superstar because your books are fucked by paying Rudy Gobert 200 million dollars."
Does that really justify 200 million goddamn dollars for rudy gobert
Top 10 player of all time and you let Rudy Gobert of all people get to you

Rudy Gobert has made two All-NBA teams
Rudy gobert $200 million for 10 pts/game lol.
Oh its all good man I love chatting basketball. Speak of the devil guess who just outplayed Rudy Gobert tonight? Jarret Allen!
[Gobert's Isaiah Thomas retweet](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/08/24/rudy-gobert-retweets-isaiah-thomas-gordon-hayward-recruitment-after-kyrie-irving-trade/) after the latter got traded is one of the most brutal comebacks in social media history.  At the very least it was one of the pettiest.    Gobert's legit got a [hilarious Twitter game.](https://twitter.com/rudygobert27/status/667230808445337600?lang=en)
Rudy Gobert started the covid lockdown when he touched all those microphones. He's an overrated person
"I was in Las Vegas when Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert first touched down in America. There was a bus, this is a true story. There was a bus that pulled up to a red light, and Donovan Mitchell tried to feed it a carrot, while Rudy Gobert was petting it. He thought it was a horse.   This really happened. He tried to feed a bus a carrot, and now you're telling me that utah has computers? I didn't know that, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT!"
$200M  Rudy Gobert
"A lot of utah offense come from on or off ball Gobert screens,something Rudy is really good at doing. he is also the literal defense of the jazz there defense without him plummets significantly and that is something that simply doesn't go away. Mitchell scoring outburst come and go but Gobert has been stable on defense all season long he only suffers against the better offensive engines but he makes the rest of the team other than guys than harden,jokic or kyrie this game struggle a lot to get their points"
Rudy gobert in shambles
Rudy gets too much criticism tonight but allowing over sixty points in the paint is very uncharacteristic for a Gobert led defense. Really goes to show how good Allen has been tonight.   Nets couldn't have asked for a better start than DeAndre's four fouls in five minutes on the floor.
"""il m'a eu"" rudy gobert a dit a propos de jarret allen ""ce putain jarret allen m'a boomé""  ""il est tres bon"" il a dit, repetais quatre fois"
All-NBA Rudy Gobert btw
when did we start discussing Rudy Gobert?
That’s the best argument I’ve heard yet! But Giannis and Kawhi and Steph aren’t retiring any time soon. I just don’t think Mitch Gobert are good enough to contend for a title. Not even against the Nuggets. Let alone the Lakers or the Clippers or the Bucks or the Sixers or the Nets who are set for the near future.   I think now was a great time to trade Rudy for some picks and tank for a season or two to get a superstar to pair with Mitch.
Rudy Gobert to the Warriors confirmed
TIL Rudy Gobert has the strongest forearms in human history  Not even Hogan can touch him bro
"""Through 7 games, Myles Turner is defending a league-leading 10.3 shots at the rim and holding opponents to a league-best 43.1% on those attempts.  1. Myles Turner - 43.2% on 10.3 DFGA 2. Ivica Zubac - 47.4% on 5.4  3. Rudy Gobert - 48.9% on 7.8 4. Joel Embiid - 49% on 8.2""   - from https://twitter.com/iPacersblog/status/1346537083544940544  Another helpful stat in evaluating Myles is the Pacers being 4th in OPP FG% inside of 5ft. Point is, Myles is currently playing Rudy Gobert level defense while being a legitimate 3pt threat on offense. It is early, so I understand hesitating before putting him top 10 for centers league wide. But if this trend continues, he could end up being one of the best value contracts in the league, especially in light of the albatross contract Gobert just signed."
Rudy Gobert was not an all-star either year he was DPOY. He was only an all-star after those years.
"The stats say that AD honestly shouldn’t be mentioned with these other guys. I think it’s Gobert, Giannis and a healthy Draymond at the top. As somebody who watched every jazz game I can’t imagine a player being as consistently disruptive as Gobert. It’s just hard to quantify how much he impacts other teams unless you watch him consistently And know a some of the nuances of basketball. Most of the nba memes about him are just flat out lazy bullshit. He’s a great perimeter defender, didn’t get played off the floor in the playoffs, and is definitely worth his contract.   Much respect to those other guys I mentioned though. I think even though Draymond seems to hate Rudy I think they are similarly disrespected for their impact on games. That hurts to say because I dislike Draymond haha. Giannis is a great defender in his own right and very versatile. I think he’s been on some amazing team defenses so it’s hard to always determine how much of that is him and I don’t watch him a ton so I’m probably a bit ignorant.   Davis had great defensive tools but the numbers say he’s just an ok defender."
Rudy Gobert first 5 games: 3/4 with 1.8 tovs/gm. Splits of 16.5/0/37.5.
"Dtown Nuggets trading Donovan Mitchell to the Jazz for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon. I guess you can add Rudy Gobert as well, since we drafted, then traded him for Erick Green and cash.smh The Nuggets really drafted and handed Utah both their franchise players.smh I often think about what that starting line up would’ve looked like with Murray, Mitchell, MPJ, Joker and Gobert.lol Bol bol off the bench. Wild."
"Luka has done it thrice. Jokic and Giannis have done it twice. Jokic dropped 30, 20, and 10 on Rudy Gobert not so long before Luka had his 30 15 and 10 game"
"""41 million a year? Nah, that's too much money for me. 30 million a year would be enough, otherwise, those people on \\r\\NBA will mock me, and you all know that their opinion is much more important to me than that extra 11 million a year..."" - Rudy Gobert, probably"
"Jokic dominated 2x dpoy Rudy Gobert and scored Efficiently exceeding his regular season average vs elite defender Davis. He wasn't even that great vs the Lakers but far out performed embiid's playoff numbers. Embiid got owned by senile Marc Gasol due to lack of versatile scoring when the paint was taken away. Jokic is in a different league entirely in the playoffs. We aren't the same brother, sorry about it."
https://uproxx.com/dimemag/utah-jazz-rudy-gobert-offense-touches-nba-stats-clippers-loss/  I’ll just leave that there
"best in history shaq but nowadays rudy gobert is the best i have great respect for him. Shaq man, you already made your name written in history, the whole world knows it."
"If your Rudy Gobert why would you care what people say online, you secured the bag.  Also Shaq is just jealous because the dudes today make way more money than he did when he was playing."
It’s not like he actually dunked on Rudy gobert bro like get real all this is dumb
Right. And kd went at Rudy for no reason.  https://nothinbutnets.com/2020/09/16/nets-kevin-durant-shot-rudy-gobert/amp/
"&gt;Rudy Gobert has been getting pretty unnecessary hate   lol, not because of this incident, but Rudy's a grade A douchebag."
Its not.  People are confusing two separate things.  There are people who say:   1) Rudy Gobert is overpaid  2) Rudy Gobert is overrated  At no point do people bash Gobert for signing a large contract.  They are criticizing the contract because they dont think he is good enough for it.  They think he isnt good enough for it because of his play on the court.  But people make the lazy connection that it must mean these people are “bashing” Gobert for taking a big contract.
&gt;hate him for his contract  Bruh we talking about the same Rudy gobert?
"Rudy was better than Eubanks at least. Where missing LMA killed us was on offense. It really helps to have someone pulling Gobert away from the rim.  The Jazz are always good at not allowing 3pt attempts because they never have to help on PnR with Gobert in the paint. You have to break them down from the mid range or attack Gobert with strength, but with Derrick White out and Dejounte off, we didn't have the firepower to do it."
yeah yeah let's keep pretending Rudy Gobert was patient zero so we can justify our irrational hatred for anything French. See also: Tony Parker's entire career
"&gt;I actually don't think there are many teams who want Rudy on that contract.  That doesn't make the point you think it does. The value of a player is not the result you get if you run an exercise where you ask every NBA franchise what the largest contract you'd give a particular player in a vacuum would be, then calculate the mean contract across all 30 theoretical offers.   The value of a player is the most amount of money a team would be willing to pay for a player. After all, that's the only contract a player will sign. A player won't sign a contract for the mean amount of money when they know at least one team will offer more than the mean amount.  Yes, Gobert is a bit of a divisive player that won't work in every team environment. For a team with Gobert to work, you need other players on your roster to fill out your offensive prowess. Luckily, that's exactly what the Jazz have done over the last few years, and as such his value to the Jazz is greater than every other team - the roster building and coaching they've done has resulted in an offense that creates the most open 3s in the NBA, despite the fact they have a center who will never shoot any of them. Other teams aren't as ready as the Jazz are to roll out a team that can compete with Rudy on it, so they wouldn't find Rudy as valuable.  &gt;Also, ""objective calculus"" is the most hilarious add a second word to make it sound better I've ever seen  ""Objective calculus"" means the same as ""objective way of calculating,"" but said in fewer words - but with the added bonus that it triggered you. Glad I could teach you something today, kiddo."
"I don't think people realize how much height is an advantage. We all know it is, but I don't think people understand how drastically it changes the odds. (I know this doesn't apply to Rudy Gobert directly, but I don't have any stats on this from outside the USA)  About 1 in 5 American men who reach the height of 7'0"" or greater, make an NBA roster at some point in their lives. And a lot of the ones who don't are just completely unathletic with no interesting in sports, or have illnesses or injuries that prevent them from making it to the highest level - disproportionately so vs other heights."
Dude that is such and understatement of what Rudy Gobert does for the jazz
"Damn really shaq? Lmao this dude, remember what he said about last year when Kobe died? I guess all of that is down the drain, this really got you up late at night thinking about Rudy Gobert? Smh, you a grown ass man dawg"
"What Shaq is doing is the equivalent to criticizing Mutombo's $15M contract in a year when Shaq made $20M.  He's trying to set it up as if it's disrespectful that Gobert makes more than he did, but if Shaq were in the same circumstances, he'd make more than Gobert. Shaq would be a supermax player, Rudy is not."
rudy gobert &gt; pascal siakam
"The ""G"" just got dunked on in brainsketball by Rudy Gobert. I'd rather come second to Shaq in scoring than second to Rudy in brainsketball."
I don't think that using a different situation proves that he's insecure about Rudy Gobert.
I dont know what it is about Rudy Gobert but hes getting the most random hate ive ever seen. And this started way before the corona mic thing that was just another reason for people to pile up on him. Why do people hate him so much im genuinely curious?
"His teammates and others in France believed he wouldn’t make it in the nba. Shit, he [wasn’t even selected for the national teams](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30582683/jazz-center-rudy-gobert-loves-game-covid-19-infamous-mic-touching-incident)  &gt; Probably when I was 17, 18. We have national teams in France -- the under-16s French national team, we have the under-18 and then under-20. The under-16 national team didn't even call me. Usually, they made a preselection of 20 or 25 players, supposedly the best in the country, and I wasn't even in those -- I wasn't even called. I got called in under-18 for the first time, because the big, the big man, was injured. So I got lucky. I got called and I ended up playing in the European Championship and I ended up being the best player on the team at the competition."
"At the end of the day, Rudy Gobert is going to make more money from his NBA career than Shaq"
"This doesn't say centers aren't supposed to pass, but that it's not a priority, which... is true? It's a bonus, not a base requirement. No one is ripping out their hair because they have a big who can facilitate. But also nobody is saying Rudy Gobert is a bad center because he averages &lt;2 APG."
"The Spurs went long stretches trying to go small with Rudy Gay matched up against Gobert.  It went about how you would expect.  It's a young team and exciting to watch, but they don't have enough size without Aldridge to compete consistently.  Utah was absolutely red hot from three.  Utah had 63 points off of threes compared to 18 by the Spurs."
And the Jazz fucked themselves when they gave Rudy Gobert 200 mil

"I agree, it's wild that he's making insecure comments about Rudy Gobert, but here we are"
I know this sub shits on Shaq(easy upboats from the other children) but Jesus fucking christ. Shaq feel threathened by Rudy fucking Gobert is the fucking low point of r/nba. Wow.Just wow.
"Shaq took offense to the Superman nickname given to Dwight (Shaq has the Superman logo tattooed on his upper arm)  He moved on to Javale but still clowned Dwight from time-to-time, guess he got bored of that too and decided Rudy Gobert is all that is wrong in his world."
"Considering how much the salary cap has gone up since then, and how much Shaq earned aside from his contract money its a really weird thing for him to be salty about  Rudy Gobert is a good center but he is not even remotely close to threatening Shaq's position in the pantheon of great big men."
Not even close to top 5 defender maybe not top 10. Ben wallace Dennis Rodman rudy gobert giannis Duncan garnett off the top of my head. If Ben Wallace or Rodman played in this era with switching they would be way better than Draymond.
No shit idiot you think I don’t know that? Gobert is getting paid 200m shaq is allowed to talk about him in the context of a 200m player. Safe to say Rudy is way short of the expectations of that kind of player
"I absolutely know I’m biased but there are a lot of reasons to be. Mike Conley is starting off the season playing the way he ended last season (aka really good). Donovan has started this season a little slow but if the playoffs are anything to go off of we have nothing to worry about with him. Bogdanovic (our second top scorer last season) is back after missing the bubble with a wrist surgery. We have a 2 time DPOY with Rudy Gobert, plus Derrick Favors returning fills a massive hole in our roster when Rudy is off the court. Plus we have Jordan Clarkson who has been a walking bucket, and Joe Ingles who pairs really well at the PnR with Favors. Really just have a really solid team and our roster basically only improved since last season."
looks like shaq's critically acclaimed rudy gobert has a lot of work to do
"everyone watching sees it, even the Spurs announcers knew they were less hesitant to even drive the lane due to Gobert.  This happens at least a dozen times a game.  You can really see the difference when Favors hits the floor, and Favors is no slouch.  IMO this is far more important than he gets credit for, literally a 1 man zone/spy?  The Jazz defense often times is just, funnel your penetrating defender to Rudy.  There have been few players like him, fuck Shaq"
trying to get all those 3p percents back in 1 game  and i just want to say rudy gobert
You wouldn't know it looking at the stat sheet but Rudy Gobert dominated this game
Murray should learn to not go against Rudy Gobert lol
Pretty much anything Rudy Gobert does honesty. “Rudy’s so good at defense he shut down the league” comments still show up
"Yeah, Rudy is to defense what Harden is to offense. He single-handedly makes a team competent on that end of the floor and is the single biggest reason the Jazz are a playoff lock. There aren't enough true elite offensive guys in the league for each team to just choose one. Teams without have to find other ways to win. The Jazz have with Rudy. I think a lot of guys talk about wanting ""respect"" who are already widely respected and its, lol. But Gobert really does deserve more appreciation for what he does in the league."
"I know in the long run it doesn't really matter but Shaq was a #1 pick and Gobert was 27th. Rudy was the lowest rated player in 2k14. He has seriously put in the work, is now 2x DPOY, 3x All-NBA, 4x All-Defense, and an All-Star. If that's not worth the max I don't know what is."
Rusell Westbrook? Chris Paul? KCP? Danilo Gallinari? Kelly Oubre? Rudy Gobert?
"Shaq is hating so hard on Gobert. Is Rudy overpaid? Yes absolutely, should the jazz have signed him? Yes absolutely. But that's what you're going to get when you max a player that isn't a perennial all-nba and it's going to be a bad contract, specially in a position like center"
"I love Shaq as a player. I think he’s one of the best ever. I watched him and OBVIOUSLY he’s better than Gobert. But over his last 5 years Gobert has averaged 18.9 rebounds per 100 possessions, and Shaq never exceeded that mark in a season. Rudy is one of the best rim protectors and defensive 5’s of the last 20 years, and gets you an efficient 15-20 points a night. Can he be your first or 2nd best player on a championship team? I think with the right other pieces maybe. I’m not sure Donovan Mitchell can be the 1st. But this is a good, top 8 team in the league. And the idea they shouldn’t sign him, and so what? So they can find another top 3 center with the 27th pick?"
"Did I? Okay. No one ever insinuated that Shaq wasn’t better than Gobert. But Shaq said 11 points per game as if he’s some Tyson Chandler type who averaged 11/10, and not 16/13 on DPOY defense  Shaq scored at a much higher volume, no one is denying that.  But, Gobert is a better defender. Shaq finished 2nd in DPOY voting once, and received votes in some form or fashion two other times.   And are we really still using raw stats to judge how good of a defender someone is? Like, Shaq having more blocks because of the fact that drastically more shots are taken outside the paint? Blocks in general are down for big men.   And the reason Shaq’s free throws are up is because of Hack a Shaq, they exploited him.   Scoring is the most important part of the NBA. No ones denying that.  But, Shaq’s peak per 100 possessions is 38/17.5 and 3.9 blocks on 57.8% true shooting.  Rudy is 23.8/19.3 and 3.5 blocks on 68.2% true shooting. And, true shooting is up league wide over 20 years, but that doesn’t apply as much for big men who don’t take 3’s.   So blocks are actually very similar, Rudy rebounded slightly more and Shaq scores a lot more, OBVIOUSLY. Obviously Shaq is the better player. But for people to clown Rudy like he’s some 11/10 scrub like Omer Asik, and not good for a hyper efficient 16/13 on DPOY defense, like come on.  And I have watched Shaq, and you didn’t contribute anything to the conversation."
It is definitely Rudy gobert
"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bendowsett/2020/06/29/rudy-goberts-improved-perimeter-defense-is-an-major-tool-for-the-utah-jazz/  “The NBA’s stingiest defenders against isolation possessions, per that same tracking data (minimum 75 possessions defended, a sample of 130 players):  1.    Rudy Gobert: 0.688 points per chance allowed  2.    Jerami Grant: 0.702 points per chance  3.    Jrue Holiday: 0.709 points per chance  For those who don’t spend their days studying NBA scoring numbers: That’s really low. Even when you add roughly 0.15 to a team’s figure to account for potential offensive rebounds on misses (standard among math folks in the league), you’re talking about efficiency in the low-80s on a per-100-possession basis – the NBA’s worst offense averaged just under 105 this year by comparison.”  Tell me again how he can’t guard the perimeter. I swear to god, most of you people watch some highlights of Curry or Chris Paul putting Gobert on skates and that’s formed your entire opinion of his defense. Read up on him before before spouting your uninformed take.   Same thing with his offense. He isn’t amazing, but he’s a great screen setter, good roll man and a lob threat. He is not a liability on offense.   With him, the Jazz are a decent playoff team with an outsize chance at WCF / Finals. Without him, they’re a lottery team and Mitchell leaves. So yes, you do pay him the 200 million over him leaving. Does it mean he’s worth 200m, especially comparing him to other centers like Embiid or Jokic? No. But he’s worth 200m to the Jazz because of their circumstances as a small market team. I don’t know how that’s so hard to grasp."
Rudy Gobert - $190 million guarantee for the next half decade  Love - $30 mill per year for another 3 years    That Gobert contract is INSANE to me. Great player but my god I would be sick paying him that much.
No that was Rudy Gobert.
"Jokic turns gobert from great to good and Rudy does the same to jokic they cancel each other out. Look at jokics stats the rest of the playoffs, Im not even gonna look em up but I know he played much better 2nd and 3rd rounds. Jamal murray on the other hand holy shit I'll never disrespect him again"
"But he is...I’m sorry but you’re never winning a ring if he’s one of your two best players. Yes, he’s holding his team back in multiple ways. He obviously helps his team in many ways as well.   Any team would absolutely love to have him but not for 200 million dollars.. you’re crippling your team by doing that.  Answer honestly. Will the Jazz ever win a ring if Rudy Gobert is one of their 2 best players? We both know the Jazz are going to get bounced in rounds 1 or 2 for the next half decade. Maybe they get lucky one year and make a WCF If every single domino falls their way."
you telling me rudy gobert is what’s holding the jazz back? any team in the league would love to have the 7’1” two-time dpoy center. if the jazz didn’t give him an extension some other team would’ve bought him out.
"right, but it doesnt matter how good you are defensively if youre still a heavily flawed player offensively. come playoff time, youre always gonna get exposed. bucks shoulda realized that. rudy fucking gobert can struggle in the playoffs due to his offensive limitations. ben simmons becomes a negative player cuz of his offensive limitations. both those dudes are more impactful defensively than bledsoe. and while bledsoe is a better offensive player than both of em, goberts screen setting and rim rolling is arguably more valuable than bledsoe's offense anyways. bledsoe just isnt a playoff caliber starting point guard offensively esp on a team who's best player is already a bad shooter  youve gotta either be able to shoot, or be really good at other things offensively to make up for not being able to shoot in order to stay on the court in the playoffs. bledsoe is a decent, not great offensive player that cant shoot. those guys have time and time again been proven to not be playable in the playoffs if you wanna make it far. no matter how good his defense is. you can literally be a dpoty and it doesnt matter"
"This isn't nba 2k. This is a human being who has worked his ass off and earned a lot as a yound player.  He deserved it and he got it. Its a sign of faith from an organization that can't risk being bad to players. We are not a destination of choice already. Raptors have been over paying for players since the beginning. I'd rather do it with an MIP, all star, all NBA player. Even if he might not deserve it as much as rudy gobert."
"sure, but bledsoe was already proven to not be a player you can rely on come playoffs. forget about the whole choking thing, players that are heavily flawed on one end have been proven to be nearly unplayable every year in the playoffs. look at andre roberson. dpoty caliber defender before all the injuries, and he was still a negative in the playoffs cuz it lets opposing teams play 5-on-4 in the playoffs. even someone like rudy fucking gobert, arguably the best rim protector in the league, can get ran off the court against a bad matchup cuz of his flaws  keeping bledsoe over brogdon was the wrong move and you dont need hindsight to see that. its good that they were able to at least get a first outta losing him, and ultimately with giannis reupping and the jrue trade it kinda worked out for the bucks anyways. but it was a very perplexing move at the time"
"If you are one of those guys who just google his stats, you have to do it better, man.  Shaq was not a 13rpg man. But he was among the 1st and 5th in RPG, in a lot of seasons.  He was not a DPOY but he was a nightmare on defense.   He lead the league in % in 10 seasons.  Rudy is a 60% and Shaq a 53%. But Shaq makes x2 PPG, more BPG, more APG.  What the hell are you talking about? Gobert is miles away from Shaq.   Put Gobert in the free agency and giving him the max is not be something everybody is going to do.  It looks like some people didn't watch Shaq play... not even the highlights. My god."
If Rudy Gobert can camp in the paint every possession nobody is going to attack the paint they’ll just chuck threes instead since it is a more efficient shot
"Joe ingles, very good defender, can run the offense, can play off ball, attack the rim, high level shooter, great chemistry with rudy gobert. One of my favorite players ever to watch."
"I’m selling him short because he simply wasn’t what he was supposed to be, yes injuries are unfair and robbed of us what could have been, but that’s the reality. And to say he would reshape the center position and align it back to the old day is living in an alternate reality. It’s fine if you want to believe that, though I choose not to. Steph, Harden, Dame, Klay and all the various skyfuckers came just a couple years later and have rendered Oden less integral. Yes, Gobert is a G and Adams is an understatement, but even Rudy is talked about as the guy “who costs $200M but doesn’t win you a chip”.  Anyway, I loved Oden as a prospect, and I saw him decimate the Warriors live, actually I think my last Dubs game in person, but he was not the future of the center position which very much trended towards stretching the floor imo, accompanied by wings that can transition defensively. Either way, appreciate the rare good discussion on this sub 👍"
"If Adam Silver had any sense of humor, he'd make Rudy Gobert the poster boy of the immunization push."

"IDK, I felt like he was pretty decent at protecting the rim for you guys. He's no Rudy Gobert but you could be happy with the outcome."
Rudy Gobert is the anti ~~Christ~~ Zion
"Every time someone dunks on Gobert it makes the front page and brings out the ""$200 million lol"" gang.  Guess it just means actually dunking on Rudy is a highlight by itself."
We also have a legitimate back-up center who doesn't make our interior defense non-existent the moment Rudy Gobert steps off the floor.
"Zion wtf u doing...an underhand layup against a rim protecting big??? Man go up strong and muscle through gobert chest to chest same way u bodied favors, I know Rudy not as strong as favors so u gotta look to 2 hand that thing on ze steifel tower’s head so we can get a poster of that"
"the broadcast did their best to shit on rudy gobert for some reason  all he did was completely dominate  yes zion scored, hes really good"
"you think rudy gobert, a frenchman, has ever been within 2 miles of a fucking buffet"
Zion beats Rudy at the rim a couple times?   Throw the clamps on em. Good job Bogey.  Edit: oh... Gobert heard me make that joke I guess
"TBF I'm not familiar with the wolves and don't know what yall need. I'm just incredibly low on Simmons, I think he's trash for a max contract player. It's not just his 3 point shooting, dude just can't shoot flat out and that's a huge problem that I think isn't talked about enough. He's a career 59% free throw shooter, even horrible shooters like Rudy Gobert do better from the stripe and obviously Rudy impacts the game in a way Ben simply can't. People like to say well even though he can't shoot he can impact the game similar to Draymond, problem is he doesn't have even a fraction of the basketball IQ of Dray. It's my opinion that no team will ever win a ship with Ben on his current max deal. They were close when they almost beat the eventual champion Raptors in 2019 but he was still on his rookie deal at the time.   Lastly, Wolves and the 6ers would have to give up way more for the Wizards to even think about taking this deal."
"Rudy Gobert and Giannis don’t have the same role defensively, Lopez is a paint protector, Giannis is a hybrid player (wing forward) which means he’s more versatile defensively than a center, so making that bullshit claim about him not being able to guard the oppositions best player during crunch time is complete bullshit. AD is the Lakers big that plays the 5 during crunch time but is constantly defending the best player. Miss me with those excuses."
"If Rudy Gobert consistently knocks down 3s, the Jazz will be scary"
Rudy Gobert is likely at his peak right now (assuming his offense gets back to normal).
"**Sixers rookies:**    Maxey: literally the goat. Doesn’t fear anyone on the court. Maxey would drive to rim against Rudy Gobert or Anthony Davis, it’s insane to his confidence. Floater is literally wet as fuck, it’s his best tool and he rapidly looks to be up there with guys like trae and harden in terms of players with best floaters. Good midrange too and the three is better than advertised. Needs to work on getting other guys involved tho, as if there’s times when his shot isn’t falling, a good point guard needs to be able to play-make so they stay on the floor.   Isaiah Joe: looked rough his first couple games, although he was getting spotty minutes and seemed to be really testing the waters in terms of what shots were working best for him. Recently though, he’s been pretty lethal as a catch and shoot guy, like two or three games ago he dropped like 18 and then followed up the next night with like 16. Guy was shooting from pretty deep too. Defensively he’s been alright. Looks like he is already a good team defender, he’s had some smart plays whether it be a steal or a good switch. His struggles are also mainly on the defensive end with defending bigger wings and forwards, so I’m hoping he’s working closely with the strength and conditioning coaches to bulk up. Also doesn’t have enough confidence in his handle, as he can get into the habit of deferring when even a little pressure is applied by the defender. I’m not really worried in this regard, he’s a rookie fighting for minutes trying to only make the right plays and not mess up to much. Although it is harder to tell of what his full capabilities are at this point.    Paul Reed: he’s still gettin out the mud   Nah he hasn’t played much and he’s really more of a old school four aka a small ball five in today’s game and we have plenty of centers so he hasn’t been able to see many minutes."
"Yea his last 6 games have been: serge ibaka twice, chris boucher, Myles turner and domantas sabonis, nikola jokic, and now Marc gasol and Anthony davis. And his next few games are lamarcus Aldridge, Mitchell Robinson, Rudy gobert, and then KAT twice (if he’s back from covid). 3 straight weeks of tough learning, but he’ll bounce back soon enough"
"You really going out here disparaging Jaren as hard as you can. You haven't even acknowledged the rest of my comment, and a simple google search or watching a game would show that he is elite defensively, but fouls often. The reason he doesn't rebound is because he doesn't need to, as I said. He excels as a shot blocker, and a transition / perimeter offensive threat. He's got great handles, finishes ~70% at the rim and 40% from three, both on above average attempts, and a 5% block rate. In comparison, Rudy Gobert, one of the best shot blockers in the game, has a career high of 7%. He can defend, both perimeter and interior, and runs the floor. You comparing him to Steve Novak and Andrea Bargnani, one-dimensional players, doesn't do any justice when you think about the impact that Jaren really has. 2 DWS in the past season, and a neutral defensive box plus minus isn't exactly an insane net negative on the court. You just need to stop looking at him through shit-covered lenses and realise that he's a good player, and that his role is different to Deandre Ayton, Kristaps Porzingis or any other big man in the league. He isn't just tall and shoots 3's, he's a versatile perimeter and interior defender, and an offensive threat wherever he is."
"foul baiting from Centers would go up a ton, so if you want to see Rudy Gobert flopping on offense all the time this would be a good rule change."
"Oh I agree Rudy has been amazing, but I just think acknowledging that Myles has stepped up his defensive game is a necessity. Obviously I’m a Pacers fan and you’re a Jazz fan so we are going to disagree based off who we see more of, but can we agree if it’s not Myles or Gobert we riot?"
"We’re not #1 overall, but we’re #1 when Rudy in on the court which is what should actually matter. If the season ended today Gobert probably wins DPOY in a landslide"
"He's 1st in the league in [DFG%](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=D_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100).  His defensive rating is [102](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612747) which is better than Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday, Bam Adebayo, and Joel Embid, aka literally every other player except Rudy Gobert listed on Op's all-defense teams.  &gt;He's actually not in the top 20 for DBPM  Wrong he is 17th. https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html"
Rudy Gobert abusing Nikola Jokic?  This is like posting a sick Celtics highlight in the Lakers sub
They couldn’t.  An off ball foul gives the Jazz a freethrow and possession.  There was nobody close enough to Royce before he dumped the ball to Gobert.  And then once Rudy had it the refs were very unlikely to halt a game winning dunk.
"FG% isn't really indicitive of 'shooting' for a bigman. Otherwise Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, and Clint Capela are really good shooters.   Shooting in this context to me means 3pt and midrange, but I was mostly referring to his 3pt"
Honestly mines probably very similar to this. Except idk about Gobert. I think he will have some competition with a guy like Christian Wood. Obviously if the Jazz has a good enough record it’ll be Rudy. But with the east it’s hard for me to say that Ben Simmons and no raptors make it. I know the stats and the raptors record but still hard for me on that one
"&gt;Jordan being heads and shoulders above Bill Russell is not remotely close to being true relative to era.  Where are you going with that? You're the same guy who was arguing luka wouldn't need 6 rings to pass jordan because the league is more talented but now you're comparing Jordan to Russell without accounting for the different talent levels. Nobody is gonna match bill Russell's dominance relative to his era, unless you believe he's the goat then I dont see how this helps your argument.  The thing with Jordan is that just from watching him you can tell his game could translate to the modern era pretty easily, and that him at his peak would almost definitely be the best player in the league. In bill Russell's era defense was much more important allowing him to be impactful without being a great offensive player. His game wouldn't translate as well to many eras and he'd just end up a higher iq rudy gobert."
Rudy Gobert
rudy gobert
"I don't get what you're trying to say, but will say that I define a star as a top 20 player. I believe JA has that kind of potential since he's so good early on at only 21. He can be a more offensive Rudy Gobert which isn't such a clog on spacing but also an anchor of defense. That's a really good selling point. Over this season alone, bigs who can rim protect have gone high up on value."
Rudy Gobert was not relevant during D Rose’s prime
Rudy Gobert
"Yup, maybe Rudy Gobert COULD be an exception due to how elite his rim protection skills are, otherwise, I’m not paying a center 15-30 million who still can’t defend them. It is not the be all-end all if you can’t stop a superstar big man, as the playoffs has shown."
Stanley Johnson saw Rudy Gobert get a supermax contract averaging 11 points a game and realized he had been doing it wrong all this time.
*Puts like 4 of the top 10 players and Rudy Gobert on a list*    Op: is this the optimal team in today's game?
"Probably gobert, slides in more easy, but depending on the team ben could do way more than rudy."
Diet coke Rudy Gobert
Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert
Kyrie for Rudy Gobert?
Rudy Gobert
"I just don't agree with that logic, Rudy Gobert is all NBA, still isn't all NBA calibre on his offense"
Are we still calling Gobert their best player? I think the Jazz without Mitchell are worse off than the Jazz without Rudy.
"Dame Lillard, James Harden, Demar Derozan, Giannis, what Kobe said before blowing 3-1 lead in 2007, Rudy Gobert. And hey guess who else? Lebron in 2011 after “Not one, not two, not three.” There’s seven right there  Now tell me why it bothers you so much every little thing PG says?"
I think Drummond on a playoff caliber team that can reign him in is a huge weapon that people are sweeping under the rug. Has he played for bad teams and stat farmed? Yes. But he still has skills that you can’t find anywhere in this day and age at his position. Drummond with ZERO usage can still average +10PPG because he’s simply a dominant offensive rebounder - easily the best in the NBA. He’s not the defender that Rudy Gobert is but he’s still crafty enough to create turnovers in 1on1 situations and can offer some level of rim protection.  Get this man buying in on TOR and he could easily average 16/16 without you having to run many iso sets for him. Drummond will always feast on putbacks and finishing lobs/dump off passes.
So like Rudy Gobert who just got paid 40 millies
"What a pointless post. Hassan is a limited defensive anchor. Like Clint Capela or Rudy Gobert. He’s okay, playing okay minutes, on an okay team. If he didn’t deserve a spot then he would be out the NBA."
You mean like.. Rudy Gobert?
"Nah look up his combine stats [definitely slow but moves well for being 7' 7"", and this is him before NBA training](https://streamable.com/idlt9)  His stats were slow but on par with players like brook lopez and Rudy gobert. I think his real work needs to come on the offensive end from freethrows to post moves."
Khris Middleton and Rudy Gobert
So who you taking between Rudy Gobert and Jokic?
"Yeah no shit drafting isn’t a guarantee. It doesn’t make it not the only way to win if you’re a small market team.   It’s like saying buying a lottery ticket isn’t a guarantee. It’s also the only way to win the lottery.   You tank. You draft high. You hey superstar? No? You tank again. Rinse. Repeat. Only takes 4 or 5 years to get your guy.   What you DONT FUCKING DO. Is what the Jazz do. Suck for a few years. Get some good picks. And when they suck instead of trading them for picks PAYING THEM SUPER MAX SALARIES FOR A DECADE like we’ve done since Stockton and Malone retired.   Deron Williams, Carlos Boozer, Gordon Hayward. Rudy Gobert.   “Well guys we drafted and didn’t get a superstar. Oh well. Let’s just go with it. We’re pretty good I guess.”  🤷‍♂️  The whole point of the NBA is to win. If it’s not we might as well stop playing. If every team just sucked every year it wouldn’t matter. It wouldn’t increase your draft odds were that the case. You constantly have teams in phases of rebuilding. The NBA would be so much more competitive this way.   You’re right that the NBA is broken in terms of small market teams being able to compete. But if this is what the league gives you to work with you work it.   Again. Ask the Spurs. It sucks to suck for a few years but in the long run it saves you time rather then pouring money into mediocre players and sucking anyway."
There's no point. The MLB and NFL both trucked thru their seasons with absolutely no consequences. None of the hundreds of players who caught covid in both leagues suffered any long term effects or even lost a step. It ain't March back when Rudy Gobert caught it and we all had no idea how deadly covid actually is brother. We know it to be totally benign in 99.9999% of young healthy people.
"Over in Japan, they’re having baseball games with half full stadiums because they all took it seriously by quarantining and distancing. They all did it together.  But America can’t be bothered to even try. And now the pandemic gets prolonged, lives you’d never think would be lost get lost, and the people we hold dearly in our hearts are getting affected.  I pray for not only KAT (especially with everything he’s gone through), but for Rubio, Juancho, and any other players and people.  Fuck Kyrie Irving and Rudy Gobert"
"Utah Jazz for sure. We have the league's most sympathetic and likable player, Joe Ingles. Really funny guy, you just can't hate on him. We have Donovan Mitchell, best player of his class (2017). He would have got Rookie Of The Year award but he got robbed by Ben Simmons. I don't wanna get into that, complex situation. Anyways we have Rudy Gobert, good ol French guy, best defencer in the league. He got 2 back to back Defensive Player Of The Year. And we have a really good chance to be champion this year."
Lamelo's upside is Jason Kidd  Wiseman's upside is a mix of Giannis and Rudy Gobert
He also seems to have unnecessary beef with Rudy Gobert ...
"You can say the same thing about Rodman, jermaine O’Neal, and Rudy gobert. Nobody is calling those guys “glorified role players”"
Marc Gasol was a DPOY-level center for years and he wasn't Rudy Gobert or anything as a rim protector.   Obviously not saying that Jokic is Marc Gasol. DBPM is not a good stat.
Russ isn’t much of a defensive upgrade. Since they are weak at the center spot they should go for Bam or Rudy Gobert
"Beef with Rudy Gobert now ended, Christian Wood is my nemesis now"
"On a talent level Kyrie is definitely on par with Dillard. I'd put him above Butler and Mitchell without a second thought.   The fact that you listed fucking Rudy Gobert, CP3, and Trae Young says all I need to know about how valuable this conversation is going to be."
"NBA players should absolutely not get priority especially since many had such disdain and lack of respect for the pandemic, especially early on. Case in point, this guy who infected many teammates:  https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/us-sport/nba/rudy-gobert-coronavirus-nba-utah-jazz-health-latest-a9398801.html"
you have no all nba players on your team though  rudy gobert is an all nba player
"At least we didn't commit 40 mil a year to Rudy Gobert. Dude can't spread the court but sure can spread the rona, lol."
"He was an all star but had a huge drop off.   * 2018: 23/5/4 and 2.5 spg on 58% TS * 2019: 19/5/5 and 1.7 spg on 52% TS only 38 games played  East all stars were really weak that year. You had Nikola Vucevic, Victor Oladipo and D'angelo Russel all making it (not bad players by any means) and in the West you had Donovan Mitchell, Luka Dončić, Rudy Gobert, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond Green, Mike Conley and Marc Gasol all missing out. If he's in the West he's pretty solidly behind most of the aforementioned players and doesn't come close to a 2nd all star appearance."
No doubt. Rudy Gobert should be MVP
Rudy Gobert
"Ok, but this is all just a discussion of *scheme*. Rudy could be the most switchable defender in the NBA, but if he doesn't play on a team with a personnel that will facilitate him switching, then he won't switch. And when you look at the Jazz there are *maybe* two players in the rotation who could regularly switch onto Rudy's guy? The problem with Rudy in a switching defense isn't Rudy, it's the fact that *everyone else on his team is so much smaller than him* and can't replace the defensive presence he brings to the paint, where he's regularly asked to defend two or three guys at a time - and does so successfully. The Jazz have a lot of decent-to-great wing defenders (Bogdanovic, Ingles, O'Neale, Niang is a pretty solid rotation defensively), but *none* of those guys are equipped to protect the rim or seriously guard the five. And Conley and Mitchell shouldn't be guarding wing players at their size. Clarkson is a defensive liability.  Rudy *can* switch onto elite guards. He just *doesn't*, because if he switches onto elite guards, the Jazz don't have the defensive personnel to support him switching. Apart from Gobert, the Jazz are a pretty small team; their starting PF is only 6'4"". This is the reason why Gobert's defensive numbers in the clutch are [so fucking astronomical](https://www.ksl.com/article/46705809/rudy-gobert-has-been-the-leagues-best-clutch-player--another-reason-he-should-be-an-all-star); because those are the only time that coach Q says ""Hey Rudy, I'm putting you on their best guy"". Because when crunch time happens and everything is on the line, you'd rather lose to Derrick Jones Jr. or Daniel Theis than Dame or Tatum. [Just look at this play here](https://twitter.com/Chase_Observes/status/1210481904085950464?s=20): Dame has the ball with about 20 seconds left; Gobert is his primary defender, he runs Dame off the line, forces a pass out, and then the ball ends up in Melo's hands, which Gobert swats out of the air. The numbers back this up too - in the last two seasons, [Gobert has averaged 0.73 points per attempt on isolation attempts by guards](https://twitter.com/Ben_Dowsett/status/1208811329873530880) in switches, and that doesn't even capture the amount of times where a guard attempt an iso against Gobert and then thinks better of it and wisely ditches that idea instead.   But just to throw you a bone, here are a few clips of Rudy guarding players on the perimeter and generally doing a good job, in case the numbers aren't good enough for you.  [Rudy on Malcolm Brogdon](https://twitter.com/dsjenson/status/1219486493518913536?s=20)  [Rudy swatting Trae's iso attempt](https://twitter.com/griffdunk/status/1208051219056300033?s=20).  [This play where he recovers from Austin Rivers' crossover and then fucking sends him to the shadow realm](https://twitter.com/griffdunk/status/1222233799729147904?s=20)  [Rudy Gobert stopping an iso attempt by Devonte Graham](https://twitter.com/Ben_Dowsett/status/1208810396787695616?s=20)  The problem isn't Rudy. The problem is that when Rudy leaves the paint, the entire defensive scheme collapses because Utah's scheme is built on two things: running guys off the 3pt line, and funneling them towards Rudy in the paint because he's basically the one of the greatest rim protectors that basketball has ever seen. And if he's not in the paint, there's nobody to rebound, there's nobody to box out, there's nobody to contest at the rim, which means that if a guy manages to get past his man (this will happen, sometimes Bogdanovic just gets cooked, or Mitchell has a defensive lapse), it's a free two points. And if Rudy leaves the paint, then the Jazz can't be as aggressive in closing out on 3's, because if they sell out too hard to contest, their guy will just drive to the rim and all of Utah will just have to pray that they blow a wide-open layup.  In essence, if the Jazz switch Rudy onto a perimeter guy, they're giving up a thousand free looks at the basket in order to shut down one guy from scoring. Sometimes, that's the right play to make. But for 99% of the game, it's way better to let Rudy camp in the paint and do the thing he's better at doing than basically anyone else in NBA history. Make people shit their pants when they get past their man, then put up an inefficient floater or fadeaway 2."
"Don’t put words in my mouth I said AD is better at guarding smaller guards than Gobert which is why I think he’s better. Using cherry picked stat of isolation plays doesn’t actually correlate to guarding elite guards. His isolation defense on bigs and attacking wings will offset the small sample size of going against Steph/cp3/dame.   You also kind of prove my point. If steph/cp3 can force switches onto gobert they get an advantage and if you can’t switch 1-5 you can get eaten up on the perimeter which is exactly what happened in the bubble against the nuggets.   The best defenses in the nba come playoffs all are switchable. 2017 rockets, warriors dynasty, 2020 lakers and heat. Rudy is at his best when he can dominate the paint presence, but he can’t switch onto elite guards like AD can. And that’s why in playoffs Rudy hasn’t been able to win games on the defensive end.    Regular season points per isolation means nothing in terms of this debate. The argument is if Rudy can defend small guards as good as AD. He can’t."
"Yeah, so am I. None of those guys tend to isolate onto Gobert and cook him or take advantage of a mismatch.   CP3 is exploiting the Jazz' defensive scheme because he knows if Rudy steps up to contest a midrange shot, that means an open layup on Rudy's man. He's 2v1 in that situation, and the failure is not on Rudy to defend, it's on the Jazz' other defenders to prevent CP3 from getting past them.   As far as Steph and Dame go, they typically don't even try to isolate Gobert on a regular basis; they're more than content to bomb away from behind the arc. And the Jazz have always played drop coverage with Gobert, so he rarely if ever ventures from beyond the 3pt arc.  Usually the way Gobert gets switched onto guards is either in transition, or if one of his teammates gets taken out from the play after getting caught on a screen, and when that happens he defended isolation more efficiently than any other player in the NBA.   Great offense will always beat great defense head to head, and citing three guys who typically don't even challenge Gobert directly as evidence that he's not a good isolation defender is just the height of silliness."
Just a reminder you are paying rudy gobert the max and your team will lose in the 1st round
"Rudy getting cooked by guards is one of the most over-parroted and unsubstantiated things that gets repeated in the whole subreddit. People post the clip of a recently injured Rudy getting put in a spin cycle by *prime* Steph at the height of his powers and show that as evidence that he can't switch, but he's literally one of the best isolation defenders in the league; last year he defended the 3rd most isolation of any player in the NBA, and he allowed the fewest points per attempt per isolation of anyone in basketball. [Here are some more numbers to back up the claim that Rudy is so good at switching](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bendowsett/2020/06/29/rudy-goberts-improved-perimeter-defense-is-an-major-tool-for-the-utah-jazz/).   The other thing that hurts the perception of Gobert is that the Jazz just don't have him sell out when he gets switched on because they'd rather give up an open 3 than an open layup or dunk (which is eminently reasonable), so Rudy when he does get switched on doesn't usually go out to the perimeter. That's not a personal weakness, that's a schematic choice by Coach Q."
so rudy gobert is the mvp this year? gotcha
"He is the best perimeter defender.  That said, the impact Rudy Gobert makes is insane. He doesn’t even have to block it, or have a hand in the face to affect the shot. Grant Williams literally air balled a two footer because Rudy was standing their.   A three contested by Trae Young will be missed more then a layup contested by Enes Kanter. I think interior defense is just more important.  Gobert is a lock in my books for DPOY unless he gets injured or something. This isn’t to disrespect Ben tho, his defense is still incredible."
Giannis  Ben Simmons  Russell Westbrook  Rudy Gobert  De 'Aaron Fox  Edit: replaced Miles Turner with Gobert
Just checked and it doesn't really seem like it. There's only been one DPOY since 2007-08 that wasn't able to lead their team to a top 3 defence and that was Tyson Chandler who took a Knicks defence that was 22nd the year prior and brought it to 5th.       |Season|Player|DRTG Rank| :--|:--|:--| |2019-20|Giannis Antetokounmpo|1st| |2018-19|Rudy Gobert|2nd| |2017-18|Rudy Gobert|2nd| |2016-17|Draymond Green|1st| |2015-16|Kawhi Leonard|1st| |2014-15|Kawhi Leonard|2nd| |2013-14|Joakim Noah|2nd| |2012-13|Marc Gasol|2nd| |2011-12|Tyson Chandler|5th| |2010-11|Dwight Howard|3rd| |2009-10|Dwight Howard|3rd| |2008-09|Dwight Howard|1st| |2007-08|Kevin Garnett|1st|
Not a troll. There is zero chance I’m talking Donovan Mitchell and Rudy fucking Gobert over Steph Curry and Draymond Green in the playoffs.  Have fun underperforming in the playoffs.
"I think the MVP should be the best player on the best team, Rudy Gobert"
Rudy Gobert would do terrible terrible things to Looney and Wiseman
"Mitchell's skill is much more obvious and noticeable, while Gobert's greatness doesn't usually show up in highlights or stats sheets. But there are a lot of players similar to Donovan Mitchell, but very few like Rudy Gobert."
*Cries in Rudy Gobert*
"No, it just hurts the team LeBron is on, which it should. LeBron shouldn’t be getting paid the same amount as Rudy Gobert."
The best player on the best team right now is Rudy Gobert. Either that’s not the criterion or Rudy should be in MVP talks
"I mean look, youre probably not gonna be wrong if you bet against the Jazz winning it all.  Youd be correct 100% of the time if you made that bet every year since since they came into existence.  However, they are playing beyond expectations at the moment, so just let people enjoy the fun, there doesnt ALWAYS have to be this ""yeah BUT theyre not gonna win it all"".  Just 11 months ago Rudy Gobert shut down the league, so let them enjoy their time in the spotlight"
Rudy Gobert for MVP? Sorry but offense is way more important than defense in reg season. You’d be better off saying Mitchell.
Okay and the Jazz have more wins than him lmao. RUDY GOBERT MVP
Yes I do watch the Sixers. I don't think you're giving Milton the credit he deserves but I expected that. I don't expect him to actually make the all-defense team he hasn't built up a narrative.  Shake Milton has the same defensive on/off RAPTOR as Rudy Gobert.
Yeah but the Jazz are better and if we're going only by the seeding logic Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert should be MVP
"He's also 363rd in BPM, 303rd in WS/48, and 420th by VORP. It doesn't really matter how you slice it; most advanced stats don't reflect kindly on Wiseman's play so far this year.  That's fine; most rookies struggle, and it's entirely possible that Wiseman turns out to be a great player. I thought he would show more defensively than he has, the way Rudy Gobert did in his rookie season.   The only reason this looks bad (which also applies to the Timberwolves) is because they passed up on LaMelo Ball for fit reasons despite the reporting that they thought he was the best prospect in the draft.   Both teams would love to have LaMelo at the moment, not even for developmental upside (which he does have), but because he's contributing at a starting level right now!   For the Timberwolves it's even worse because LaMelo is playing better than D'Lo, who is the whole reason they didn't draft LaMelo."
"Shaq: ""When it comes to All Star selections, all I know is I have more than Rudy Gobert"""
Lmao Rudy Gobert about to sob again. It's not our fault dude is the most boring max player of all time
"Well you live in fucking Utah no wonder you are trying to bully people and act cool on Reddit. What hell else you have to do in Utah? Had to pay fucking Rudy gobert 205 million (3rd highest paid player of all time, highest paid center of all time) just to stay."
iight bro I’ll side with you. Rudy Gobert is the greatest player of all time to get bounced from the playoffs in an embarrassing fashion 3 years in a row
"definitely not trolling  gobert has his 3rd DPOY locked up  and hes going to be the best defender in the NBA for more than just this year  the jazz are completely dependent on rudy. when he goes out, derrick favors try as he might, is just not rudy gobert  its pretty clear when you watch jazz games, teams dont usually contest gobert because it never works  and when they do contest gobert, lmao, alright then, maybe you get a cool highlight 1/20 times"
"1st team should be Rudy Gobert, Lebron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ben Simmons, Shake Milton.  2nd team should be Joel Embid, Christian Wood, Anthony Davis, Mike Conley. Not sure about the other guard.   Myles Turner and OG Anunoby shouldn't make all-defense. Leading the league in blocks/steals has a separate award."
You said if Rudy Gobert played in the 70’s he would be regarded as the GOAT. i stopped listening after that
A more offensive Rudy Gobert.
yeah no I thought you were being legit but then I saw your Rudy Gobert is the best defender of all time take so it’s cool
"Yup, nothing like letting Deandre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Steven Adams, all offensive juggernauts, have good games against you"
What is wrong with this sub. You honestly think Rudy Gobert is their all star over Donovan Mitchell ? You people are nuts.
"The rules that have the biggest impact, and defensive three seconds is BY FAR the most important, have nothing to do with being more physical or the nba being soft. That’s just narrative. If Rudy gobert could stand in the paint for the entire game of course scoring goes down. But people want to talk about physicality because all they know how to compare to is the 90s and they want to talk about handchecking, when it’s irrelevant when comparing to the euroleague."
"So is Rudy Gobert is better than Dame Lillard right now?  Timmy actually has more in common Gobert than any other modern player IMO. One of the GOAT defensive players but not as capable of a 2-way first option as people assume on here.  He may be the reason the Spurs were a top 5 defense every year (also Bruce Bowen who finished ahead of Duncan in DPOY voting those years but nephews who didn't actually watch ball back then have no idea who he is) but Tony, Manu, Michael Finley, Bowen, all were as big reasons why they had those records and won chips. They carried the offense a lot more than Timmy."
There's a reason James Harden is a far better player than Rudy Gobert. That's even with Gobert being a far better offensive player than Harden is a defensive player.
"So, if you and your wife are out for the evening, and Rudy Gobert or Joe Ingles rolls up, and one (or both) of them starts spitting game at your wife, you should be good?"
"I know Rudy Gobert and Steven Adams watch One Piece, Rudy has had some kicks with Luffy on them in the past."
"It's not that people don't enjoy watching Rudy Gobert, it's that people just straight up don't watch Rudy Gobert. They only look at the box score and read about those 2 Rockets series."
"One thing to note with the DRAPTOR data- nba tracking data has inexplicably been missing a game from Rudy Gobert for awhile now, and RAPTOR heavily relies on that. But RAPTOR still has Rudy playing the correct number of minutes which means it thinks Rudy played a whole game doing nothing. If that were fixed Turner would almost certainly also be behind Rudy in DRAPTOR. Still been a really great season from Myles though"
Rudy Gobert would have gotten more money to burn down half that same Krispy Kreme.
"I mean you need both. No slight to Donny. But for sake of diluting the argument let’s just say Mitchell is somewhere between great and elite on offense and average at defense.   Gobert is #1 top tier elite on defense, and average to above average on offense. Nevermind he can’t score outside 3 feet, thats a more impactful player.   Last night rudy was JUST as dominant as Mitchell if not more (they could not score in the paint when he was in, we bled points with favors; and Rudy had a good offensive night) - but I’m sure you would consider Mitchell being the OP player of the evening because he delivered the gut punches."
let’s be honest you aren’t really a Rudy Gobert fan lol.
Rudy Gobert is the most overrated defensive player possibly in the history of basketball. And I say that as a Rudy Gobert fan.
"&gt; an up-and-down defensively (pre-COVID) 2019-2020   This is a huge misconception IMO. The 2019-2020 Jazz struggled defensively but it was not because Gobert regressed. The Jazz switched their focus to a more offensive heavy lineup (introducing Bojan, Conley, Clarkson). They replaced guys who were generally much better defensively (Rubio, Crowder) while also losing their backup center in Favors. They were running Tony Bradley at backup center and it wasn't working.  Rudy is the defensive identity of the team, so when they were no longer a top 5 defense, everyone seems to blame him, even though almost everyone around him got replaced with someone worse.   The biggest change this year is the reintroduction of Favors to the lineup, as the Jazz are no longer hemorrhaging points whenever Gobert leaves the floor.  Gobert really didn't change last year. If anything, he actually improved slightly on the perimeter (though it remains the weak point of his game). A mix of voter fatigue and a fact that most people didn't pay attention to the Jazz lineup changes affected his narrative negatively."
"The Jazz pick and roll game is strong. If you sell out on defending the three, the Jazz will knock it to Rudy inside, or drive with the threat of the lob to Rudy.  Atlanta tried what you are suggesting, and had the personnel to get it done with Capela in the paint. They didn't have Trae, which actually helped them defensively. The Jazz started slow while they adjusted to the strategy, with 20 then 25 points in the first two quarters then they made the halftime adjustments and scored 67 in the final half. They just changed their rubs and screens by moving Rudy higher on the pick and ended up with 20 made 3 pointers.  Earlier in the season we lost to Phoenix and the Wolves (with KAT) because they got straight up physical with our shooters, moving as far as the refs would allow them. Jazz have adjusted to that as well by speeding up the pace and allowing less grind in the half court. Jazz primarily shoot in the first half of the shot clock and take the first open shot which leaves less room for thuggery.   Ironically, I think that the best team that could pull of the type of defense you are suggesting is the Jazz themselves. They do an excellent job of defending the three point line because of Rudy Gobert who can defend the paint area while contesting the perimeter also if needed. Jazz are 5th in the league at opponents 3 point percentage. Atlanta is second (which explains their strategy against the Jazz.)  And finally, we may be getting to the point where continually suggesting that Donovan Mitchell isn't a superstar is splitting hairs. He did exactly what superstars do last night and does it over and over again."
"You might be right if we’re speaking only about offense. I can imagine a scenario when they might need someone else to be generating shots causing defenses to think twice. But I think you may not understand just how great gobert is on defense. He kind of moves around like a young deer, and doesn’t have the smoothness of a Hakeem or other great defensive minded bigs, but the guy is legitimately affecting every play the other team makes when he’s on the court. I don’t think the stats quite paint the picture, but to me it’s clear Rudy is perhaps the greatest defender I’ve ever seen. Not kidding. Not exaggerating. Given how important defense tends to be down the stretch, in a more objective world, Rudy should be in the conversation for mvp. Especially if he can solve his butter fingers and free throw problems on offense."
&gt;Utah Jazz star Rudy Gobert would never.  ~~Photoshops~~ Legitimate photographs I have seen on the Jazz sub say otherwise.
&gt; Utah Jazz star Rudy Gobert would never.      Obviously because Shaq would be too scared to attack Gobert at the rim 😤😤😤
Rudy Gobert Lol.  End this list.
"I love Gobert, but I think it’s more than just blocks. More defensive rebounds, better defensive rating, more defensive win shares. Like it’s close and Rudy is still going and Howard fell off a cliff around his Lakers/Houston time, but I still think at their peak Howard is better defensively  https://stathead.com/tiny/YnqHQ"
"Team success matters for MVP, but so does individual production. Rudy Gobert doesn’t belong there.  KD has missed 30% of the season so I wouldn’t rank him in the top 5 either. I’d say the front runners are currently Embiid &amp; LeBron, followed by the likes of Jokic, Curry, Kawhi, and Giannis."
I thought this sub’s obsession with defense-first players was over. I see I was wrong . Rudy f’ing Gobert 😆😆😆😆
"What a flex, Rudy Gobert MVP"
Favors is untouchable if I'm Utah. He doesn't have any real value to get me any real asset back but he's valuable af for Utah's team since he's the perfect 8th man on a contender with Rudy Gobert on it.

"Honestly if I was compiling a tier list of great defender it goes like this:   Elite: luka doncic, trae young, Alex Len, Rudy gobert, and AD  Good: jimmy butler, jokic, KP, Bradley Beal.  Bad: LeBron, dort, isiah Thomas, lamelo balls, London balls, and Kyle Korber.   Just my opinion tho."
"That Rudy Gobert guy is good, huh"
"Donovan obviously had a hell of a night, but Rudy Gobert was absolutely dominant in the paint tonight, don’t think the jazz can pull away like they did at the end without both of them doing their thing"
"Talk about finishing in style! In the last 2 minutes of a 4 point game, Donovan hit a deep three, dropped a player and hit another three, connected on a lob to Rudy and Gobert finished another heavily contested dunk. Amazing!"
"Jazz are legit. Donovan is a bad man, fuck rudy gobert."
Jayson Tatum &gt; Rudy Gobert
Damn straight. Rudy Derrick Henry Gobert.
Kobe don't have Rudy Gobert in 2006 dumb ass. Mitchell have such a good team and yet failed to capitalized a 3-1 lead.
"Mutumbo won his first DPOY in his age 28 season, while Rudy is the front runner for his third in his age 28 season. Gobert’s on pace to pass Mutumbo so far, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he ends up with 4 or even 5 DPOYs when all is said and done. Defensive centers actually tend to age pretty well. The block numbers are also incomparable era to era. Gobert will also have a lot more first team all defense selections than Dikembe. Unless someone like Turner or Capela takes a huge leap in the next five years the first team all defense center spot basically has Rudy’s name on it for the next 5 or so years."
"Okay mate, here's a better argument for why Gobert won't be MVP. MVP 99% of the time is a top 2 seed. Which means even if Jazz are the 1 seed, there are 3 other teams that 'qualify' to get an MVP award. I guarantee the other 3 teams will have a better player than Rudy, or a more narrative based player than Rudy."
Rudy Gobert.
"Last year Gobert was about the same with us. We’re better off this year with Favors but without Rudy I think we go from top 4 in offense and defense to maybe 10th offense and 27th defense. I think Embiid and Jokic are the other two in the conversation, but I’d probably agree Steph would be number 1 by this metric. I’d go Steph-Embiid-Jokic-Gobert-Doncic in terms of dependency. And shoutout to trae young fwiw"
Trust me I don’t get Giannis. He can bully Rudy Gobert and Myles Turner but will struggle against the worse defenders for some reason.
Chris Paul Victor Oladipo Jimmy Butler Kristaps Porzingis Rudy Gobert
"RN on BBrefs MVP tracker (which has been damn accurate historically) he’s not even in the top 10, behind Rudy Gobert and Paul George. So not good"
If this clown thinks Rudy Gobert could be an mvp then yeah I guess I do. It’s fucking ridiculous to think. Honestly you’re probably the target audience. Clueless and gullible. It’s a shame.
Aight I’ll text them now. They don’t possess brains if they think Rudy fucking Gobert has any shot at MVP lol
"Underrated: Rudy Gobert and Royce O'Neale.   Gobert's offensive numbers are down across the board, but he's still arguably our team MVP and the difference between him and every other player in the league defensively is as massive as it's ever been.  O'Neale is known for being a 3-and-D guy, which he is doing very well at this year. He has also added a playmaking element to his game. He's more comfortable putting the ball on the floor and making difficult passes. The next step in his game is creating his own shot, which he has shown signs of improvement on so far this season.  Overrated: Honestly, nobody. Our only rotation player that's struggling is Niang, and I don't think anyone has expectations for a 9th man. Even then, he's improved defensively."
I don’t need to do that. I know for a fact right now that Rudy Gobert will for sure not be considered for mvp. It’s not an opinion. It’s a stone cold fact
I can assure you that Rudy Gobert is not going to be in consideration for the mvp lol. This isn’t even debatable
Lol Mitchell Robison is in the nba.. Rudy gobert doesn’t defend guards does that make his defense overrated? Also bill russel was Uber athletic kinda like a bam build who says he wouldn’t be able to guard guards?
Well yeah the best big men defenders take away the most efficient shot it Basketball (2 of the most efficient shots of your a center who doesn’t foul like Duncan). Like peak Lebron is not a more impactful defender than 2016 Rudy Gobert
"Rudy Gobert is not the DPOY , just look at the chiefs interior D"
"i did watch Shaq play. I saw him get destroyed by Yao ming over and over again.   I saw shaq use his 300 pound frame and 7'2 size to basically bully people in the paint. HAck a shaq was created bc he couldn't shoot free throws to save his life. He also only won 4 NBA rings and played with hall of fame point guards his ENTIRE career. dude should have won like 7-8.   Shaq was a horrible shot , never shot a 3 cause he couldn't and was barely passable as a shooter INSIDE the paint. He was just a monster physical specimen.  The dude would be a sloth in the paint right now and he wouldn't be able to live there because Rudy gobert would be lining up on the 3 line which fat ass shaq would have had to guard.  Shaw did go coast to coast a few times...Congrats.   you are wrong."
WCS looks like Rudy Gobert on defense compared to KP rn
"I fucking love watching Ben Simmons play defense. I pretty much never care who wins any of the individual awards, and it’s not like my opinion matters cuz I’m using zero stats to back this up lol, but hypothetically speaking in a game 7 with a 1 point lead I’d rather have Ben Simmons as my defensive stopper than Gobert. He’s just so much more versatile.   No disrespect to Rudy, he’s a game-changing defensive presence too.  Also Embiid should be on this list over Lebron, he’s a monster."
"Yet he has/had his career highs against Utah, Philly, Phoenix, and Boston, all teams with trash big men like Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid (2x), Deandre Ayton, Al Horford"
"Kanter got so insulted and butthurt that the Jazz decided to move forward with Rudy as the starting Center instead of Kanter. He went out trashing the Jazz organization, teammates, coaching staff, pretty much everyone because he couldn't believe a guy with half his offensive moves in Rudy Gobert would be more valuable than Kanter.  It's the same with guys like Whiteside. Numbers are nice and all, but if you allow the same numbers (or more) on the other end then all your offense is essentially worthless."

"&gt;Draymond Green was the best defender in the league for a few years  Dray was an incredible defender but he was never as dominant &amp; impactful overall as Gobert has been for the past 4 seasons  &gt;(Dray) was a far better offensive player than Rudy at his peak.  Sorry, but that's just not true. Like, at all."
"I could talk about this all day, but the simplest stat summing up why I feel this way is this--The Utah Jazz are 12.6 pts/100 possessions BETTER when Rudy Gobert is on the floor.   12.6!!!!  And he's doing that even with arguably the best backup center AND bench unit in the league playing the 15-20 mins/night when he's resting.   He's the centerpiece that the team's entire offensive &amp; defensive systems (both top-5 in the league) are built around, because of how unique &amp; special he is on both ends of the floor."
That award already exists and is called MVP  Also not what you're asking but if the offensive player award existed i think that Rudy Gobert will win MVP this season since it counts for overall impact. thoughts ?
"I take issue with this- Gobert has given Jokic fits in the past, but people only remember the most recent shit. They definitely go back and forth but when Jokic scores a bunch it gets headlines and people remember and bring it up endlessly, but if you go back you will see games where Jokic absolutely couldn't get shit done but ""holding Jokic to X points"" doesn't really stir up the same attention.  Now its true that recently Jokic gets the better of the matchup and he should get praise for that, its truly impressive. But it should not be seen as some sort of career long weakness of Rudy. They both keep ""solving"" each other. If anything its the unstoppable force and immovable object trading small eras of owning each other."
Problem with this theory is Jazz's best player is Rudy Gobert and he is known for rim protection and solid screens. Not exactly slaying a dragon to add to your legend.
You think Rudy Gobert is a top 10 player? Also Ingles is a borderline All-Star?
I hope they do well unless they face the Suns. Rudy Gobert is a unique player and one that a lot of people miss when talking about the elite frontcourt players in the league.
G- Luka Doncic   G- Stephen Curry   F- LeBron James   F- Anthony Davis[INJ]  F- Nikola Jokic   Bench:  G- Damian Lillard   G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard   F- Paul George   F- Rudy Gobert  WC- Devin Booker   WC- Chris Paul  INJ-REP- Zion Williamson  The only player whom I think would miss out would be DeMar DeRozan
"In no particular order, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, Mike Conley, And more. Not to say they don’t deserve an all star, but the west is to stacked for me to rank them above these guys."
"Rudy is the better player as of now due to his defense but Bam Adebayo has the higher ceiling. Also, Bam is a lot harder to game plan against compared to Rudy Gobert."
Rudy Gobert has entered the chat
rudy gobert becomes MVP for next 5 years
"""Rudy Gobert has more influence than Kim Kardashian"" - these Hornets announcers do have a way with words haha"
"Toni kukoc, should be in hall of fame. Rudy gobert, you can say underrated about a lot of defensive players(like gasol) since their play do not show up on the stat sheet"
like when Ben Simmons recently said that he felt disrespected by the Jazz having Rudy Gobert guard him and everyone was having a cry about him talking shit and dragging him for being 'cocky'.  god forbid anyone is confident in themselves and their playing abilities.
"If we ignore talent levels and look at more playing styles, Turner gets compared a lot to Rudy Gobert because of the shot-blocking but really Theis is his best comparison in the league. Turner and Theis have very similar strengths and weaknesses.   They're both undersized defenders who catch lobs and shoot 3s. They both get bullied by bigger bodies.    &gt;Can Myles deal with Bam? I’ve never really paid attention to that.   So there are 4 key matchups to look at.  Turner has done incredibly well on Bam and actually won their matchup in the playoffs, outperforming Bam on both ends.  However, looking at the other key matchups, this is how Turner's performed this season:  Opponent| FG%|Points|  Rebounds | Blocks | Minutes | +/- ---|---|---| ----|----|----|---- MIL| 33.3|3|  2 | 1| 22:51 | -32 PHI| 16.7|9 | 5 | 1 | 29:22 | -5 BRK| 25.0 | 3| 3 | 1 | 25:41 | -18   And this is one of the big issues with the Turner talks. r/nba has spent the season pretending like Turner would solve our issues but really, we already have a guy who plays similar to Turner and against the top 3 seeds in the East, Theis has actually been better.  I liked Turner for Boston because I like Theis for Boston and Turner is younger, has a higher ceiling and Theis is expiring in the offseason. However, it's wrong to think Turner would solve our problems. He would be more of what we already have.  Theis and Turner have too much overlap to be on the same team."
Maybe Rudy Gobert?
Kyle Lowry  Joe Harris  OG Anunoby  Jerami Grant  Rudy Gobert
"This stat has Mike Muscala over Bradley Beal, and Devonte Graham over Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Jaylen Brown and KD. Seems like a pretty worthless stat.   Oh it also has Chris Boucher over Rudy Gobert."
"How do you defend Joe Ingles, Rudy Gobert, and Mike Conley"
Cough cough Rudy Gobert
"&gt;Lol. Please dude. This years and last years Lakers squad is more WWE than anything than I’ve ever seen in the NBA. That’s all it’s ever been with Lebron. The decision. Not 1 not 2... I literally have a comment comparing it to wrestling a few days ago.   &gt;   &gt;I went back and watched tons of old games recently and the only one that I saw Jordan get insane calls out of his great ones was his 86 playoff game where he scored 63 against the Celts in double OT. And the Bulls lost.   &gt;   &gt;I’m not saying their weren’t favorable calls. Every era has had “super star calls”. But to say the 90’s were worse than now is just absurd.  James has never led the league in free-throw attempts -- has never really even come close to doing so, in fact.  Last year as Laker, he was 16th in FTA -- behind Spencer Dinwiddie and Rudy Gobert, among others.  This year, James is 9th ( and one of few players yet to miss a game ) and he inexplicably shoots technicals for the Lakers, which adds to his total.  Jordan once shot 31% more free-throws than anyone in the league.  After that, defenders learned to stay away from him, because if you were within an arm's length, and he missed, it was a foul.  Even other superstars commented derisively on the special treatment that Jordan received.  Literally no one in league history got the calls Jordan got -- exactly because the League built their entire marketing campaign on him, for about a decade."
Steph Lebron Gobert. After Steph and LeBron I don’t need anybody else to create offense. Steph KD Lebron still needs a good rim protector. Of all the stars in the league Rudy fits best with other stars because he operates at the lowest usage.
At 25M he is unpaid.  Compare him to deals signed this offseason like Joe Harris or Rudy Gobert.  I think the last time I looked his deal scales down allowing for more flexibility (in terms of the cap) going fwd.
So if the season ends today Rudy Gobert for DPOY and MVP. I will call ESPN
Rudy Gobert got called for a foul on the tip shortly after he vocalized some complaints.
Rudy gobert literally cried a couple of years ago when he didn’t make it
Rudy Gobert broke out in tears when he missed the all star game a couple years ago
"In that timeline we'll see posts like: ""Is Rudy Gobert underpaid?"""
The other 2 haven't had the benefit of not being the best players on their own team.  But hey I guess in your opinion being drafted to play next to Rudy Gobert and coached by Quinn Snyder is the same as beig drafted to play next to Tyson Chandler for Jay Triano
"The thing is, Westbrook’s best strength was scoring. The fact that he’s bad at it now is an issue that can’t just be alleviated by “what if he never shoots”.  He isn’t Rudy gobert or Tony Allen"
Rudy Gobert has 3 seasons where he was top 10 in offensive win shares.
"Neither are one way players. Draymond is a great facilitator. Rudy Gobert is one of the best screen setters, assisters, rollers, and knows where to be on offense at all times."
"Yes and I said usually but not all the time, but ur kind of straying away from the main point of this conversation which is that usually defense alone does not get you an all star nod or Rudy gobert would be like a 5x all star by now. Draymond was blessed to be apart of an all time great team that gave him the exposure and was also good enough to get him those nods."
"Not necessarily every time but usually it is, a good example is the jazz and Rudy gobert and Donovan Mitchell. You could argue Rudy is the more important player but Donovan probably has a better chance to win mvp or make the all star game"
"But like... by some of the advanced metrics that try to measure defense, Jokic doesnt rate out that much worse than Embiid. DBPM he's quite high for instance, among others. He gets a ton of steals for a center which is arguably more valuable than blocks since blocks dont necessarily result in a change of possession.   I'm just saying, the idea that Jokic is a bad or awful defender is just flat out false. He's a solid defender who struggles with one VERY specific matchup type that even guys like Rudy Gobert sometimes struggle to shut off. Furthermore - I'd wager that Jokic's defensive stats would look even better if he was playing with Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Danny Green, and so on. Jokic's supporting cast is extremely light on guys who can defend, let alone on the most important kind of defenders in today's NBA - wing/perimeter defenders."
Yeah like I see in today's game Rudy Gobert gets postered a lot but that's BECAUSE he contests every single drive in the paint when he can and that's why he's also back to back DPOY
"People give us shit for Donovan Mitchell, but we just traded our pick to Utah and they told us to draft him for them.  What we *really* deserve shit for is drafting Rudy Gobert and trading him to the Jazz for Erick Green later on draft inght.  Do you know who Erick Green is? Neither do I.  Though hey, if we had Gobert we probably never end up with Jokic, so maybe it worked out"
"Is CP3s ability to playmake and score at an efficient level or Stephs ability to spread the floor less valuable on offense than Goberts ability to get 2nd chance points and score efficiently? This stats doesn’t appropriate weigh different skills and therefore produces an unreliable metric to measure true offensive impact. if the point is to sum up offensive value of a player, then fine but Rudy Gobert is definitely NOT the most valuable offensive player of all time."
This may come as a shock to you but Rudy Gobert is not the best offensive player of all time
"Yeah there's a reason why so many posters feature Jarett Allen and Rudy Gobert, it's cause guys like that don't back down from anything."
"Seeding is a factor, sure, but if we went only by seeding, Rudy Gobert deserves MVP. MVP is always a mix."
"It's crazy, right? Assuming the data isn't excessively misleading, here's what I guess:   &amp;#x200B;  1. Teams are posting up less in general. Last year, only one team (Philly, 17.0) posted up more than 15 times per game. In 2013-14, 20 teams posted up that much, and the Grizzlies posted up close to 29 times per game.  2. And teams are moving away from posting up good defenders specifically. That's how Royce O'Neal ends up defending more post-ups than Rudy Gobert  3. Houston switched the most in the league, so Harden would be left guarding a PF or a C a lot more often than most guards  4. Those PFs and Cs underestimated how good Harden is as a post defender. They got a 6-5 guy on them, and they got cocky about how easy it would be to post him up and score  5. Opposing teams might have gameplanned more post-ups against Houston because Houston's switching negated a lot of what the opponent wanted to do on offense, so they resorted to post-ups because they were out of book"
100% of my dislike of Rudy Gobert comes from how good he is and the fact that he doesn't play for my team.
"One big reason is BPM cares a whole lot about doing things outside you position. Jokic gets a lot of steals, and since he’s a center, he gets a lot of brownie points for that. At the same time, he’s not penalized for having a very low amount of blocks for a center. It’s also a big reason why his OBPM is so high- having a lot of assists is unusual for a center so he gets a lot of brownie points for that too. Probably the best example I’ve seen with BPM just caring about doing things outside your position is the Jazz. Royce O’neale has had a higher DBPM than Rudy Gobert because Royce is listed as a SF and gets 7 rebounds a game, while Rudy doesn’t get many steals. If you look at the top centers by DBPM it’s pretty much just who has the most steals."
"I knew before I opened this thread Jakob Poeltl would come up   Yes, he’s been that good for us. If it wasn’t for Rudy Gobert this dude would be the focus of every defense loving basketball nerd."
"Keeping in mind it's only 1 game and I'm only talking about 1 play, but there was another possession where the offensive rebound actually went to Rudy, but it was a little contested and he just batted it straight to Paul George.  I really thought Rudy could've had the rebound entirely on his own.  His hands are big enough for it, and the Clippers player was certainly fighting but they weren't totally reaching the ball whereas Gobert had great access to it.  But instead he just tried batting it, and George was watching for that."
Putting mook on gobert was a 4D chess move.  Rudy can’t handle strength and size
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
rudy gobert plural now
Rudy Gobert cries about not making the all-star team and can't even secure a rebound to win a game.
Rudy Gobert
marcus morris was guarding rudy gobert in the fourth quarter
"Ok i will talk about that in the ""should we thank Rudy Gobert?"" thread"
"How dare Rudy Gobert recklessly throw his face into Kawhi Leonard's valuable, superstar elbow?!?!?!?!?  Toss Gobert out of the game, that shit has no place in this league."
Rudy Gobert touching everything before officially being announced as patient 0 and shutting down the league and keeping his team mates stuck in the arena. Obviously it's not his fault but just the fact he thought he was being hilarious.
"who is wrong?  There was friction, [they're on the record about it](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29406398/utah-jazz-stars-donovan-mitchell-rudy-gobert-rift-them) in the national media you seem to despise so.  Maybe more was made out of it than was actually there, but there was a strain in the relationship between Mitchell &amp; Gobert even before COVID last season.  Do things get overhyped to increase traffic? Sure.  At the same time the national sources that are well connected aren't just making shit up."
No one scared of Jordan Clarkson or Rudy Gobert in the playoffs lol
Lue seems to be trying to match Zu with gobert. He really ought to get jbaka out there. Stretch the floor and force Rudy out of the key as Rudy is absolutely dominate inside.
"Lol that sequence reminded me of that play in the 2018 playoffs when Paul George drove, saw Rudy Gobert in the paint, and immediately did a literal 180"
"Sure they can’t stop the other team from scoring but can the other team stop BKN from scoring? When it’s 140-140 each game in a 7 game series in the 4th quarter who do you think will win and close out. Rudy Gobert and Don Mitch/LBJ and AD or Harden/Kai/KD. Those 3 can close out and eviscerate 4th quarters in an instant. Keeping up with their offense in 7 games is tiresome, no defense can stop all 3 + their snipers. You gotta shoot 3s and attack the rim constantly to keep up with their firepower. Again in 7 games it’s rough."
This is exactly what I’m talking about. He’s averaging 13.2 and 6.6 this year and leading the league in blocks. Rudy Gobert is averaging 14 and 13 and will make $41 million a year next year. Does he suck? There’s more to the game than the box score man.
"Actually agree with JVG here. I can’t stand when this sub opposed everything the NBA ‘boomers’ say negatively about the game when some of it is valid  The modern game does suck in a lotta ways. The way it’s a officiated is the main reason, and criticizing that is different than randomly criticizing Rudy Gobert for no reason"
"Go on Instagram or Twitter right now and check how much engagement any player gets compared to comparable players in any other North American sport regardless of what they post. The NBA dominates social media because of their demographic advantage, not because Shaq likes to cry about Rudy Gobert making too much money.  Ratings have been sinking for years now, all this social media buzz about old ass haters on TV is demonstrably not having a significant impact on the NBA’s primary source of actual income."
"Nah not joe harris kyrie.  It's not like they getting rudy Gobert, no interior guy they can get trading harris will make up for terrible perimeter D."
"His defense is actually above average at this point. He does too much ball-watching, but he's very good on ball and can be disruptive.  His RPM is terrible because he spends most of his minutes playing with terrible defensive players. It's the same reason RPM lists Mike Conley as the 7th-best defensive player in the league this season - his on/off benefits a lot from being played alongside Rudy Gobert so much."
"I like to compare Donovan Mitchell to a flashy and talented wide receiver like Deandre Hopkins, whereas Gobert is the entire offensive and defensive line.  Both are important, but Rudy does more/fulfills more obligations while being only 1/5 of the teams presence on the floor. I agree OP"
Lol rudy is a glorified mason plumlee. Mitchell can score 30 points on 25 shots  but he's fearless. The jazz are not going to be able to get last the 2nd round. Gobert is useless in the playoffs. reddit hypes utah up for them to perpetually disappoint.
"height really has nothing to do with the question. if a point guard is posting up, he’s not going to have giannis or rudy gobert guarding him. he’s going to have the opposing point guard guarding him. there are  (were?) plenty of undersized centers who consistently could score on taller centers. if a point guard is crafty and strong enough, they can be good in the post. some guards have better post moves than a lot of centers they just don’t get to showcase their skills often."
"These are neat little facts, but media awards are not a statistics, nor do they change the dominant stats Utah is putting up right now.  Like, Rudy Gobert was All NBA 3rd team last year, are you seriously implying that Utah's Championship hopes are dashed simply because there were 2 better centers than Rudy Gobert?  Utah is a well balanced team with a lot of weapons from a lot of different places.  You seem to like media awards a lot-- this team has a legitimate shot at COTY, DPOY, and 6MOTY right now, and none of those awards even involve Donovan Mitchell, who has already shown he can flip a switch for the Playoffs.   A much worse version of this Jazz team has already taken out MVP's and All NBA players like Westbrook and Paul George before.  Just last year, they were 2 points away from beating the team who made the WCF while missing a 20ppg scorer.  I dunno, man, I just feel like people saying Utah isn't a contender because they don't have these cute ass media awards this far into the season is just a really dumb take at this point."
"&gt; please tell me what bias there would be in reporting the outcome of a basketball game  That's easy, it happens all the time.  &gt;Donovan Mitchell scores 24 as the Jazz Beat the Wolves  As a headline for a hypothetical game where Mitchell shoots inefficiently and Rudy Gobert had a better game with 17-14-6 and great defense or something. I don't mean to pick on Mitchell, I just wanted an example where a team's best performance may come from a guy who doesn't score as much, but the media and fans have a bias toward points.  That headline would be 100% facts, no opinion. But there's a bias in what facts you present. The other one is when you're a channel like ESPN and you choose which stories to even talk about. If you're 100% reporting facts and showing highlights, but you always choose highlights for the Lakers while ignoring those from a less popular team, that's reporting facts with a bias."
"Replace him with anyone and the Jazz doesn't work the way that they're currently configured. Domas is about on Rudy's level as  a screen setter, but he can't roll the same way that Rudy can. AD is a great lob catcher and finisher., potentially the best ever, but he's not the same active screener, and while he's perceived as more switchable 1-5 than Gobert, he's not as impactful defensively. Joel is a great paint patroller when he's locked in, but he's never had the level of consistent focus and effort, and he's never been as active off ball as Rudy on the offensive end. I guess the closest comp for Rudy as a player in the NBA is like, a better versio of Myles Turner's, a better (and healthier) version of Clint Capela's lob game, and the offensive screening activity of Steven Adams, except instead of just being ""borderline elite"" at those things, he's like, top two in the league in all of them. No other player in the NBA can lay claim to being that skilled in all three areas. Full stop. The only player he's really comparable to in all of NBA history in terms of his skillset and his proficiency in those skills is Dikembe Mutombo. He'll go down as one of the all-time five best defensive players in NBA history.  Mitchell is good. Like, *really good*. His stats don't show it because he's really unselfish in a system that doesn't rack up a ton of assists, but he's an elite scorer and an elite passer who could really grow into a Damian Lillard type of player as a borderline MVP candidate staying loyal to his home market for years, and he's shown to really be able to kick it up a notch in high-pressure situations. The Wade comps, while a little premature, also make a ton of sense. But as it stands right now, he's a guy who's around the top-20 mark in the NBA and he's a talented scorer, if a bit inefficient in the regular season. But he can get his own shot, he can pass, and he can score at all three levels in spite of his size. But that also describes a *ton* of guys in the NBA; Lavine, Sexton, Trae, Jamal, all guys who are (in my opinion) at least one step below Mitchell but who could fill a very similar role in this Jazz team without much of a struggle. Plus, one knock against Mitchell is that there are guys who do the same thing as him but better - Dame, Steph, Harden, Kyrie, all those guys I'd trust to fill his role in the Jazz' offense without missing a beat. Mitchell still has room to grow, he's not even 25 yet and his game will improve a lot with age and experience. But Gobert? He's irreplaceable. Nobody in the NBA can do what he does. And I say this as the biggest Mitchell stan in the world."
"Oh boy, be careful. I’ve been told by Utah fans that Mitchell playing like a superstar for 1 series, against a Denver defence, without their best perimeter defender, in the bubble means he they don’t need an actual superstar. He would need to do it for at least 3 playoff series for them to win a championship. Also been told Rudy Gobert can play like a superstar."
"&gt; Gobert is on another level than all of them.  Well, yes. That's the point. Gobert is an all time great defender, and it feels like you're trying to deny him credit for that because he is so much better than everyone else.  In the last 20 years of the NBA there have been 3 centers total that could realistically take a first team spot away from Rudy. Expand it to 30 years and there are still only 5. You could drop Rudy into literally any decade and he'd be a top 3 defense center. The fact that he's so much better than his competition today is credit to him, not a knock against his credibility."
"Rudy Gobert, Rudy Gay, Rudy Huxtable, Laker in 5."
"actually a very good point! I kind of spaced out AD, which is nonsense. I think if I had to pick 1 player to guard every NBA player I would pick Davis. He really does excel all over the floor. Giannis could reach that level too. He has the quickness/size/strength. But can he put it together with the mental aspect of defense before his athleticism starts to decline? Its possible. Davis did not enter the league as a premier defender either. Either one of those guys has a higher chance of being considered the best defender of all time than Rudy, in my opinion. Gobert is just too 1 dimensional, again, his 1 dimension fits perfectly into the Jazz system and they are an amazing team. But any fast guard would cook Rudy and its obvious. I would honestly struggle to bet against Ish Smith in a 1v1 against Gobert. He is just so flat footed and clumsy outside of the paint"
People who think that Rudy Gobert is better than Donovan Mitchell probably also thought Ben Wallace was better than Dwyane Wade when they were playing lol
"Rudy on AD has always been problematic, but for Gobert not Davis. Mitchell and Clarkson have no chance of matching up with Lebron on defense and both have the type of scoring game that can easily be nullified in the playoffs. The top three scorers for the Jazz are three undersized guards, let me know the last time that has ever worked out for a team in the playoffs. The next three leading scorers are two shooters and Rudy. The Lakers are a top 2 defensive team in the league, I’ll take them stopping the Jazz offense before I’ll take my chances with the Jazz stopping AD and Bron."
Rudy Gobert on literally any team in the NBA=minimum 50 wins.
"Rudy career in playoffs has had one bad series against GS in 2017, 2 bad games against Houston in 2018, and has been brilliant in every series since.   The ""Gobert gets played off the floor in the playoffs"" narrative is so stupid."
"Current Rudy Gobert is better then 2017 Hayward. Look at their performance and accolades, Gobert has had the better career"
Thank Rudy Gobert for that.
"Ehh, I mean Gobert IS our entire defense, which is what 2nd or 3rd overall in the league, if we take him and just replace him with Favors and Azubuike then I think our defense falls off a cliff - Favors is great in his own way, but I don't think our defense would be nearly as good with him at the helm full-time instead of Rudy. Favs is better on the perimeter, but Rudy is in a league of his own when it comes to protecting the paint. He allows our guards and wings to be aggressive on defense and play the passing lanes, knowing that Rudy is usually there to back them up at the rim.  Mitchell is a bit of a weird case. While I think he is a legit All-Star and could be an All-NBA player, I feel like a lineup of Conley-Ingles-O'Neale-Bogdanovic-Gobert with Clarkson and Favors off the bench is nearly a 50-win team, while Conley-Mitchell-O'Neale-Bogdanovic-Favors with Clarkson, Ingles, and Azuibuike off the bench is about a 40-win team. The defense just drops off so much with the loss of Gobert, it's hard to imagine them being able to just rely on purely scoring from the guards and the Bojan/Ingles duo"
Rudy Gobert is better then peak Hayward
come on dude. everyone knows rudy gobert was covid patient zero and intentionally spread it using transmissions from microphones.
"Well, about half of that series to be precise. I thought he came back in game 5 but perhaps I don't remember correctly. Still, the Jazz's great record, much fueled by Gobert, helped them to make the 2nd round by not matching them up with the Warriors, Spurs or Rockets. Still, I think Hayward was the #1 player and Rudy #2."
"He absolutely was, but ""NBA best defensive anchor for basically their entire career"" vs ""turned into an elite defensive anchor in his 33yo season"" I have to give the higher spot on the all time defensive list to Gobert.     Wilt, at his defensive peak, has an argument for being better than Rudy but he didn't come close to reaching that peak until he'd been in the NBA for more than a decade."
Rudy Gobert will finish his career an all time defensive center
"Seems like you don't understand how covid works if you think young, healthy, athletes are vulnerable to covid. You realize that over 100 players have already tested positive for covid, and its assumed that this number is significantly higher since many players likely already had covid before Rudy Gobert got it but they were never tested. And most players were not tested during the hiatus from March to June. I'm pretty sure pretty much every player that has tested positive is currently playing professional basketball almost every night at the highest level in the world. The vast majority of people experience covid as a mild to bad cold, especially young, healthy people., many have no symptoms at all. So please tell me how NBA players are risking their health by playing basketball games, when probably half the players already are immune to covid at this point, not one player has been seriously harmed by covid, and when statistically NBA players make up one of the least vulnerable groups to covid in the whole world."
I'm just happy to see Donovan Mitchell 4th among West guards and Rudy Gobert 4th among media voted West front court players.
Mitchell and Rudy 'Gocry' Gobert are getting carried by Jordan freaking Clarkson. I don't care about no 1 seed! Ask the 2015 Hawks...
"Basketball's a 48 minute game, saying that a specific quarter matters more than the others is silly, for one thing, you have to get to the 4th quarter and have the game be close, which is not always the case.   Let me put it like this, Lou Williams is an infinitely better 4th quarter scorer than Rudy Gobert. However, does that mean Lou Williams is a better player than Rudy Gobert? More impactful? No, not even close.   When evaluating players, I want the player who is the best in a 48-minute game.   Khris Middleton is a better scorer in the 4th quarter than Giannis is. Would I rather have Khris Middleton than Giannis? Fuck no. Giannis is the better player over the course of a 48-minute game, even if Middleton is the better late game offensive player."
"&gt;If that was Bron going for a dunk and Embiid shoved him in the air, would you think it was dirty?  Not this sub  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eh1859/highlight\_anthony\_tolliver\_called\_for\_a\_foul\_on/?sort=confidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eh1859/highlight_anthony_tolliver_called_for_a_foul_on/?sort=confidence)  It was consensus that when something similar happened to Bron he was a flopping piece of shit.  Bron's actually durable so he played without sitting out games vs marquee opponents (unlike someone else dodging Rudy Gobert), so there's not as much attention"
1a )Donovan Mitchell  1b) Mike Conley  1c) Bojan Bogdinovic  1d) Joe Ingles  1e) Rudy Gobert
"Crazier that rookie, 27th pick Rudy Gobert ended up as the best player from the 13-14 team"
"Leading the league in PER on pace to end the season with the highest in the history  Leading the league in BPM on pace to end the season as 3rd best BPM season in the history on basketball just behind 2009 LeBron and 1989 MJ.   Leading the league in W/S 2.5 points ahead of the #2 who is Embiid  3 games behind the best team in the east on the overall record who are the Sixers. The team of the supposed front runner MVP.   Haven't miss a single game this season for the Nuggets. The offense run through him and still is not even top 20 in usage which make him even more efficient than he already is.   Yet... People are putting him 3~5 in the MVP races or not talking about him at all. People and the media celebrated Embiid 40 points, but completely ignored:  1. 37pts/11rebs/10ast vs MIL. W 2. 39/14/9 vs CHI. W 3. 41/5/5 vs POR. W 4. 43/6/5 vs BOS. L 5. 35/12/6 vs MIL. L 6. 50/8/12 vs SAC. L 7. 47/12/ 5 vs UTA. W and against Rudy Gobert.  Those are ONLY IN FEBRUARY. Jokic is and has been the front runner for the MVP all season long and whoever who said otherwise is delusional and haven't see the stats behind his ppg,rpg and apg."
"If I look at the 70 players who have played at least 1000 minutes this season, the top 15 in Def RAPTOR are:  Rudy Gobert, myles turner, Robert covington, Luguentz Dort, Fred Vanvleet, Nic Batum,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, Julius Randle, Bam adebayo , royce O'Neal, Justin holiday, Ben Simmons, Kelly oubre, DeAndre ayton  This is littered with players who are either great individual defenders, or at least do a great job playing a defensive role in a solid system (FVV, Julius Randle, for example)   Wiggins ranks 25th out of those 70 players for the record - so hes fine enough but I can't buy all this talk that hes elite on that end   Also fair to note that he is ranked 67th out of those 70 players in offensive RAPTOR , right behind Anthony Edwards. So there's that"
Remember when /r/nba had a massive hate boner for Rudy that was so bad we thought Donovan Mitchell absolutely hated his guts so much that Donovan didn't want to play with Gobert anymore? I remember.
Rudy Gobert fucked me hardcore man. I was about to see Killswitch Engage and August Burns Red in a week when that shit happened. Was gonna see a shit ton of other bands too. Completely ruined my last year
Rudy Gobert still an idiot
"No use debating over the top 2, nobody will change each other's mind. Honestly I'd bump down KAT below Rudy, defense for a center is paramount is Gobert is elite on that end. Wood and Capela are better than Porzingis as well imo. Turner would also definitely make my top 10 somewhere."
"""Rudy Gobert, he's out with an illness"""
He’s the Jameis Winston of passers  Throws some of the better passes you’ll see in the nba  And then throws a number of absurdly stupid ones off bad decisions   Kind of been who he is that kind of inconsistency. That improving his pick and roll chemistry with gobert(night and day difference when Ingles/Rudy run one no threat of the lob with Mitchell when he’s running it) and cutting back on the forced early in the clock off balance floaters his paths to improvement on offense. He also gets worse at defense every year dont buy it’s because of offensive load it’s just a choice on his part he doesn’t have to be amazing but he’s capable of more on that end
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
problem is he'd make Jokic look like rudy Gobert lol
"I was at the Mavs/Nuggets game when news broke out sometime in the second half. One of the most surreal moments of my life.   The Rudy Gobert, Tom Hanks and the nba season news all broke within 30 minutes of each other. Suddenly everyone around us is looking at their phones and talking. The feeling of being in a building with 20,000 other people as a pandemic is kicking off. The sense of dread was real.  It was like being dropped into a movie."
Rudy Gobert might end up in history textbooks
"This will be remembered in sports history, basically rudy gobert just defensively shut down the whole nba league but other sports leagues around the globe as well"
Rudy Gobert: Lmao imma touch all these recording devices  *the next day*  Rudy Gobert: oh nooooo  *Curb Your Enthusiasm Theme begins*
Rudy Gobert proved himself as the ultimate DPOY by denying Adam Silvers himself.
"&gt; Yeah I trust a guy in Mitchell who averages 27 a game in the playoffs  You trust a guy that has been bad in 3 of his 4 playoff series?  &gt;I also trust Gobert who is one of only three guys in the league today to have a net rating of +18 or better per 100 possessions in the postseason for their career, the only other guys being Kawhi and Anthony Davis. The fake ass narrative that Rudy gets played off the court in the playoffs is so lazy  Net rating is a terrible way of measuring impact, especially per 100 possessions lmfao.   Two consecutive first round exits, including a 3-1 choke."
"“We thought KD joining the Warriors would ruin the league, but it turns out it was Rudy Gobert.”"
"What do 5 man lineups have to do with lineups combos with a player **off** the court.   Show me where on BBRef I can quickly find the Jazz point differential with Rudy Gobert on the court and Donovan Mitchell on the **bench**, regardless of the other 4 guys on the court."
Did Steve Kerr coach Donovan Mitchell during his first few years in the league? Was Steve Kerr the UTA coach when they got Rudy Gobert? Is the Warriors the only team to have swept the Jazz during the regular season?
"Yeah I trust a guy in Mitchell who averages 27 a game in the playoffs  I also trust Gobert who is one of only three guys in the league today to have a net rating of +18 or better per 100 possessions in the postseason for their career, the only other guys being Kawhi and Anthony Davis. The fake ass narrative that Rudy gets played off the court in the playoffs is so lazy"
"&gt;Steve Kerr said back in July. “So I think as a coach, you have to really focus in on that internally and show film of good screens and keep tabs of numbers. Show how many screen assists you had as a team the previous night when you’re watching film the next day. Here’s where we rank in screen assists in the league. Here’s how many we average, here’s how many we had last night. You show three really good ones and hopefully you also show a couple that also open something else up.”  Oh god people are going to use this now to justify posting their ""Triple Double for Rudy Gobert last night!! 15 points 14 rebounds 11 screen assists"" tweets and takes"
"I'm annoyed because it's complete bullshit at worst and lazy parroting at best.  1.  I don't think he's the worst defender in the league - that's just nonsense that /r/nba  says to drag him, but you know what, I'll let you have this.  Trae is the worst defender in the league. 2.  has tunnel vision - kid that averages 9 assists a game - with tunnel vision. Of course.  Perfect match for Trae.  Well done.  Tunnel vision assists! 3.  But you said remove the playmaking - only one of his primary attributes - of course, easily done.  Rudy Gobert without his defense is still the exact same player more or less, after all.  Let's look at some more criteria now:  &gt;He doesn't really do much besides shoot giving you 1 assist and 2 rebounds.   1.  2 rebounds is the same as 4 rebounds right?  So what if Trae at 6'1 is averaging more rebounds than david bertans, or marc gasol, or robin lopez, or danny green, or duncan robinson. 4 rebounds is basically 0 rebounds if you round down.  Another perfect match for Trae.  Great job.  2.  doesn't really do much besides shoot - of course, if you take away a point guard's playmaking, all he can do is shoot. You've just described all of the league's point guards.  Trae's one of all the league's point guards!  well done again.  another criteria met.  ​  76% of Duncan Robinson's shots are 3s, compared to Young's 38%.  He's 6'7, and averages 3 rebounds and 1.2 assists ​and is also a terrible defender.  You don't have to change a damn thing and he fits the criteria almost perfectly.   So by your logic, trae young, if you remove his playmaking, is duncan robinson.    You literally just focused on one thing - worst defender - then lazily tried to shoehorn Trae Young into the rest of the description based on that one bit of circlejerk nonsense."
If we're going by conference seeding then Rudy Gobert wins MVP ez
RUDY GOBERT.
I think Ben will win fairly easier considering gobert won 2 of them. I’ll pull some strings and get sixers media to start posting clips of Rudy starting the covid outbreak around voting season and we can wrap this thing up.
but you don't need Paul Pierce or Chris Bosh if you have other superstars w/ similar skills. Ben Wallace's skillset is a league of its own and very few players are comparable today (think Draymond or Rudy Gobert).
"Mark Eaton is tall asf, I’ll say he was like Rudy Gobert before Rudy Gobert.   He was very tall and he won two Defensive Player of the Year awards and he’s one of the best shot blockers of all time."
Rudy Gobert salivating
"Rudy Gobert is one of the best rebounders in the league, and the one of the newest aspects of the Jazz is they crash the offensive boards with guards/wings now which they never used to do. I don’t think that it’s a coincidence they’ve improved and are at the top of the league - rebounding is very important but not everything.  But boxing out is equally important, so rebound hunters like Drummond don’t always help"
Rudy Gobert isn’t even top 20
"Oh yeah I think gobert is better than Simmons even though I love Ben, I Rudy is just suffering voter fatigue"
Rudy Gobert
"Because Lavine is shooting the best despite being the opposing team focus.  Mitchell has Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley, Simmons has Joel Embiid and had Jimmy Butler, Brown has Tatum and vice versa and had Kyrie and Hayward, Booker was the same but now he has CP3.  Who was the best teammate Lavine had? Teammates matter and to disregard that is disingenuous to your own argument."
"According to the Defensive Impact per 100 Possesions stat, the best defensive player in the league is Rudy Gobert and it isn't even close. Simmons comparatively is at the same level of Patrick Beverly in regards to impact.   https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1368275187737665536"
"Rudy Gobert  Don’t get me wrong, he is a fantastic player. However he was underrated for his impact for years, but because the Jazz are so good this year people just start looking at obscure stats like screen assists to try and paint him as being better than he actually is."
Draymond green / Rudy Gobert . They both control defensive side of the court and don’t try to do too much
If Rudy Gobert is the Litmus Test of greatness then as Jazz Fans we should be proud.
"I honestly would say Rudy gobert. I know that people think of him as a star because of his name recognition but in reality he’s a super role player. He doesn’t create any offense of his own. He only scores 14 pts a game. His role is defense, screens, rebounding, and lobs. In role he’s no different than a Clint capela. He’s just way better at the defense part (and I mean way way way better)."
"🗣  Last 11 games since he’s started we have a positive point differential, one of the best opp fg% in basketball (perhaps the best but I’m too lazy to look), and he’s finding his touch and rhythm around the basket finishing 72% at the rim this year.  The scoring output isn’t quite there yet- but if you squint at the age 25 numbers you can see some Rudy Gobert in there."

Rudy Gobert.
"Casuals will say Rudy Gobert even though he is All NBA, All Defensive, 2xDPOY and the best player on the no1 team in the NBA"
"Steven Adams, Rudy Gobert, Kemba Walker, and Russell Westbrook."
Rudy Gobert
If you go by last years defensive tracking stats Ayton is one of the best defenders of all time and the only player on par currently is Rudy Gobert.
"Yeah drop coverage effectiveness goes way down in the playoffs when you go up against elite guards more consistently who can make pull up threes at a great rate.   For example, D-LEBRON had Rudy gobert as the best defender in the league by a good bit last regular season. His D-LEBRON ranking in the playoffs was in the 50s lol. Jamal Murray torched drop coverage"
Paying him that money was absolutely the right move lol. You aren't winning a championship with Rudy Gobert as your best player but he's good enough for them to keep winning 48+ games every year with the pieces they have.
It’s just like Rudy Gobert.  People think it’s pronounced like “go bear”. Because he had a show called the Gobert Report.   But it’s actually pronounced “Gob Bert”. Because his uncle Bert invented the gobstopper candy.
"I think it's silly that most other fans shrugged off them getting KD, Kyrie and Harden, but now they need to be broken up because they signed Blake and LA, but LA definitely won't be 'useless' either.   He's a bench piece. He gives you 6 fouls and a threat from the midrange and 3 point. People keep saying 'How are they going to stop Embiid or Giannis?' as if anybody is going to stop those two. They aren't. Rudy Gobert took his best shot at being an Embiid stopper and Joel wiped his ass with Rudy's family portrait. That's not the play you make.  Instead you focus on being the most overwhelming force you can possibly be. If Giannis or Embiid go off for 85 points a night 4x in a series, well...hats off to you.  But the Nets should not fall into the trap that they're going to stop those guys."
1. Rudy Gobert  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Mike Conley  4. Joe Ingles  5. Jordan Clarkson  6. Bojan Bogdanovic  7. Royce O'neale  8. Georges Niang  9. Miye Oni  10. Matt Thomas or Ersan Ilyasova?
"**Indiana Pacers**:      The Jazz fanbase gets along really with the Pacers fans, as both are small market franchises that have been near perennial playoff teams for the last 30 years. We don't really get media hype when we play well and generally both finish around the 4-5-6 seed range. Myles Turner and Rudy Gobert are also both two of the leagues outright best defenders and our team success is largely attributed to the impact those two have. We both consider each other to be Jazz East and Pacers West.      **Memphis Grizzlies**.        The Jazz fanbase gets along really with the Grizzlies fans too. The common link shared is that we have primarily been built around a great defensive identity, as well as a shared love for Mike Conley (who should make an All-Star team this year). The Conley trade was mutually beneficial for both teams and so they've always been chill with each other for that reason. Morant and Mitchell are also young high flying phenomenons and the future of our respective teams."

"I don’t disagree, but the offensive skill set is just quite lacking. In today’s NBA you usually need to be a average-good shooter as a player unless you’re a defensive star big man like Rudy Gobert. The exceptions to this are guys with elite playmaking or finishing like Ja or Zion but I don’t see Okoro getting even close to them as finishers or playmakers"
"I’m just point out the flaw in your argument that’s all. If the argument is “well there’s two sides of the court” then that will disqualify lots of players, like Rudy Gobert."
"Correct, in that case, why does Rudy gobert make all nba teams? He ain’t that good on the other side of the court."
"Whether or not you value defense over offense OP's line...  &gt; There are 20 other players in the league doing similar things to Mitchell but NO ONE plays Defense the way that Gobert does as well as he does.  stands true. To drive the potency of this point home, according to [NBA stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612762/onoffcourt-summary/?sort=DIFF_NET_RATING&amp;dir=1) Rudy's on-off net rating is (approximately how much he adds to the team) is +15.8.

We have Rudy Gobert who gets destroyed in the playoffs
"7 games is a VERY small sample size—especially 7 games where Rudy struggled and had to play extra minutes because the back up Center (Tony Bradley) was a massive liability against Denver.  Anyway, If you read what I wrote I literally said the only folks Gobert struggles against are MVP caliber players—like Jokic.  I also acknowledged Mitchell’s defense, but it’s incredibly inconsistent, and he doesnt switch up well, which is why Royce almost always guards an opposing team’s best player.  I agree, actually, that Offense is more important than defense, but Mitchell alone does not impact the team’s offense the same way that Gobert impacts the team’s defense.  Without Mitchell, the team as it now stands gets a BIT worse offensively, but they have other good scorers who will make up many of Mitchell’s points (and if they had the 200mil they’re paying mitchell, they could almost certainly buy the rest of those points).  Without Gobert, the team literally falls apart.  They have a 30 point swing in their defensive rating when Gobert is off the court, and that’s with one of the best back-up centers in the league in Derrick Favors.  And unlike Mitchell, if they lost Gobert, they wouldn’t be able to find another center that does what he does.  There literally isn’t one."
"Yeah everyone says Gobert gets played off the court but the only year he averaged less than 30 MPG in the playoffs was his first year in it when he only played 10 seconds before spraining his knee against the Clippers. That was the year that Curry made him a shooting star meme so everyone kind of just gathers their opinion off that  In his playoff career, he has a net rating of +18 per 100 possessions, which is higher than pretty much every superstar in the league today (Harden +11, LeBron +14, Giannis +10, Embiid +3, Dame +6, Jokic +15, Durant +12, Curry +11, CP3 +15, Paul George +7). Kawhi and Anthony Davis are the only other top players I can find in this search with a +18 per 100 in the postseason. The Jazz just never had the offense to keep up with Houston, and then last year they didn't have a reliable backup behind Rudy.  Rudy didn't get played off the floor, Tony Bradley did lol  For what it's worth, Donovan Mitchell is -7 per 100 possessions in the Playoffs. He did play a lot with the 2nd unit in those Rockets games, though. We were desperate for scoring"
Yes. Gobert is much better. We can hope Mitch can develop into Rudy.
"I would put Marcus Smart, Rudy Gobert, Paul George, and maybe Kawhi on that list as well. Tough to say in which order."
Would you rather have Shaq or Rudy Gobert?
Rudy Gobert is so fucking underrated man. Just goes to show how even the old timers don’t understand the totality of the game. Defense is just as important as offense.
"If that’s the case, I’ll have to see the whole breakdown of their methodology and how they track defense accurately, because context is naturally missing in these situations.   I saw a tracking stat that showed (at the time) that Jokic the 2nd highest percentage of makes at the rim (tied with Enes Kanter) in the league at his position... but I’m not gonna condemn Joker as a terrible defender based on that... watching the games will help us understand his defense   Also, they were targeting Rudy in the P&amp;R at times, and that’s why I hold the position that Rudy is not versatile enough to be the best defender in the league, but to be fair Gobert was ordered to play drop coverage as he can be closer to the rim  Regardless, there are things Gobert does that make him a top tier defender and Jokic an average one at best, and that can be found in the tape."
How tf you look at a team with rudy gobert in it and decide to hate donovan
"I’d have to go back and watch the game again, but probably late help defense or a midrange which Rudy usually stays near the rim and let’s that attempt go. I see where you’re coming from and I’m not trying to come off being a dick or something lol. I’m not trying to downplay your guy he had an incredible game, but so many people are clowning Gobert for his defense. If we didn’t have Gobert we’d probably be somewhere in the 20+ ranked D and that’s saying a lot. Aside from Royce and most of the time ingles our defense is doodoo"
"As good? No. Still good? Absolutely. He'd still be an elite shooter, ball handler and playmaker. Rudy Gobert wouldn't be good at all if he wasn't tall. He'd be unplayable."
I’m beginning to think Rudy Gobert is good at defense
"Start: De’Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert  Bench: Trae Young, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Julius Randle, Bam Adebayo  Cut: The rest of em  Shooting guard is definitely the most difficult to decide. Close race between all of them."
It’s crazy how guys like Bam and Draymond impact the game at an incredible high level defensively yet they never garner the same DPOY attention as people like Myles Turner or Rudy Gobert  To be clear this isn’t a slight at Turner / Gobert rather that ppl see rim protection as the end all be all of defense.
So why isn't every other 7 footer just as good as Rudy Gobert?
"In point guard DRTG he’s #2. We’re doing this by role because it makes sense. Yeah let’s compare the defensive impact of a 6’1” guard to a dude like Rudy Gobert who only plays defense and makes dunks/putbacks lol.  So you won’t accept the facts despite your source confirming you’re wrong. He’s a good defensive PG, the stats literally show it. You don’t need to be a top 10 defender in the entire league of 450+ to be considered good."
"But the rebounds are fake. That's the thing. They just don't mean much  He's 2nd in the entire league in uncontested rebounds, after just Rudy Gobert.   He just grabs a bunch of rebounds other guys don't go for that usually would go to a center."
"How you gonna say individual defence doesn’t matter and then hate Rudy Gobert, literally the best team defender lol"
"I'm gonna rate the spiciness of the takes.  &gt;Rudy Gobert is everything I hate about basketball  Average take, alot of people agree but most are indifferent to this. He's not a popular player for a reason.  &gt; Dame will never win a ring as the best player on his team. He's overrated and not on the same level as elite players like Curry, Harden, LeBron, etc...   You know, it's weird. Lately it feels like everyones been saying Dames overrated, to the point where he's becoming underrated. Everyone agrees he's not a Curry, or a Harden or a Lebron. People say he isn't a superstar for a reason.  &gt; Nuggets fans on this sub are somehow more obnoxious than Laker fans. Jokic will never win a ring as the best player on his team.   Now heres a hot take, and I agree lmao. So much victim complex man, Jokic is your guy so appreciate him without trashing Embiid.  &gt; I don't see the hype around Zion. He's gonna have a short career if he doesn't lose some weight.   Half is a hot take and half is unanimous agreement. Zion is supremely hype, top 15 currently so thats spicy. His weight is something everyone agrees on.  &gt; Boston, just go away forever please.   Bruh.  &gt; Philly ruined their title chances by not throwing everything but Embiid to get Harden   This is 50% hot take. A lot of people think Nets will sweep their way into the finals with Harden whereas alot of people aren't so sure on the Nets.  &gt; Giannis fucked up staying in Milwaukee   Most people agree.  &gt; CP3 is the greatest pure point guard of all time.   I've seen this title given to him a dozen times. Very popular take.  &gt; The Spurs have always been boring to watch.   I assume you mean TD Spurs. This is a funny one, earlier on this was very agreed upon, but since the motion offense became popular, this is a very unpopular opinion.  &gt; Oh, individual defense barely matters.   This is becoming more and more prevalent. Defensive schemes, help defense and rim protection are agreed upon  on being much more useful than 1 on 1 defense."
&gt;Rudy Gobert is everything I hate about basketball   Ooooh spicy please tell me why you hate Rudy
"Nah, Rudy Gobert"
"Gonna give a lot. If I'm gonna get downvoted Imma make it worth it   Rudy Gobert is everything I hate about basketball  Dame will never win a ring as the best player on his team. He's overrated and not on the same level as elite players like Curry, Harden, LeBron, etc...  Nuggets fans on this sub are somehow more obnoxious than Laker fans. Jokic will never win a ring as the best player on his team.  I don't see the hype around Zion. He's gonna have a short career if he doesn't lose some weight.   Boston, just go away forever please.  Philly ruined their title chances by not throwing everything but Embiid to get Harden  Giannis fucked up staying in Milwaukee  CP3 is the greatest pure point guard of all time.  The Spurs have always been boring to watch.  I think that pretty much covers pissing off this whole sub.   Oh, individual defense barely matters."
Yup I got him a solid close number 2 for sure right after Jokic Embiid Harden Dame Lebron and Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert is DPOY at his year.
Rudy Gobert is the best rim protector in the league.
The same thing will happens to Gobert in the playoffs because Rudy cant guard a pick and pop like Drummond and he’s slower then him.
**Ben Simmons on DPOY race vs Gobert: “I scored 42 on him and I’m not a scorer”**  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10001405-ben-simmons-on-dpoy-race-vs-rudy-gobert-i-scored-42-on-him-and-im-not-a-scorer](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10001405-ben-simmons-on-dpoy-race-vs-rudy-gobert-i-scored-42-on-him-and-im-not-a-scorer)
"LeBron could literally shit in the middle of the logo at an away game and most of the comments from this sub would be justifying it. Using LeBron as a metric for what is or is not acceptable behavior is not going to work.  Fact is, it's weird for stars to bitch about awards. Giannis and Harden throwing some shade at each other over MVP was bad enough but Simmons this year is taking it to a new level. Every player thinks they deserve awards, some of them get salty when they don't get them (Rudy isn't exactly innocent in that front) but it's really rare for someone to be actively shit talking their competition for an award completely unprovoked, especially as early as it started this year.  When Gobert got snubbed for the All-Star game, it wasn't hard to tell that he was salty as hell about it. He blamed it on people not valuing defense properly, but he very pointedly did not call out one of the All-Stars and say that he deserved it more than that shitter did. That's just not how things are usually done. Embiid here is saying normal shit. ""I think I deserve it, if I don't get it I want my teammates to win it."" The only reason it's noteworthy at all is because of how hard Simmons has been campaigning for himself."
"Looks like Royce forgot Rudy wasn't playing today, that funnel play usually works and then Gobert can easily rotate and swat it."
The refs have called more fouls on entry passes in this game than Rudy Gobert has gotten in his entire career.  Apparently you can't challenge the pass at all now?
Lakers have FORTY SIX points in the paint.  Forgive the hot take but I think this Jazz team could use a Rudy Gobert type player to become and *actual* contender.
"People don't understand that while TS% indeed does matter, it's only ONE stat among a billion other things that a player can do well on the court and be great. Is Russell Westbrook an inefficient scorer? Yes, but he also has a 61-win pace everytime he posts a triple double, is a great playmaker on offense (five of the last six years averaging 10+ assists) and everyone talks about how great of a leader he is.  Saying that Russ isn't great because of his TS% is like saying that AI wasn't great because of his TS%, you are literally ignoring every single aspect of basketball and only focusing on scoring efficiency.  If TS% was the only thing that mattered, Joe Ingles and Rudy Gobert would be the best duo in the league with their sky high efficiency, heck Zion Williamson and his 65% TS makes him better than LeBron ofc."
"Rudy Gobert. I know people are obsessed with points per game, but Mitchell doesn't score particularly efficiently, and people don't really grasp the impact of Gobert's defense.  This is evidenced by:  On/off numbers over the last 3 years  Players ON | Players OFF | Net Rating ---------|----------|---------- Mitchell, Gobert |   | +8.6 Mitchell | Gobert | -3.9  | Mitchell, Gobert | +1.5 Gobert | Mitchell | +9.4  Impact stats  Player | BPM | RAPTOR| RAPM| LEBRON ---------|----------|----------|----------|---------- Mitchell | +3.5  |+2.3 |+0.9| +2.3 Gobert | **+4.7** | **+7.1** | **+3.3**| **+6.3**  These are the impact stats for this year, but you can check any year and it'll be the same results.   There's noise and bias in these stats, and they don't capture everything, but clearly they're capturing *something* that our eyes are not. You don't accidentally stumble into impact stats with this large of a differential over this big of a sample size.  Usually there are arguments about Gobert in the playoffs and how Donovan's diverse scoring kit is extra valuable in the playoffs or in high leverage situations, (and I agree to a certain extent) but I think the effect is overstated and I think the playoff on/off numbers are too small of a sample to make a numbers argument one way or the other."
Wait no Rudy Gobert either? This is gonna be tough for both teams lol
Donovan Mitchell is the most overrated player in the NBA.   Rudy Gobert is the most underrated player in the NBA.
"I mean what else is he gonna say ""Well I think Rudy Gobert should win even though me and Ben both have dropped 40 on his team this year, Im sorry but have to go against me and my guy to give it to him again"". Just like Rudy should be saying he should win this year again."
There's Rudy Gobert and everyone else.

lol @ Gobert.  Joel averages 24/14 against Rudy and abused him for 40/20 earlier this year.
Luke put Barnes on Rudy Gobert for like 8 minutes straight and the Jazz scored like 30 points or some shit.
"I'm not sure, but if you happen to have a spare Rudy Gobert lying around it's a little easier. . ."
Lol@ go after an Embiid stopper. Is any team allowed a weakness now? They should just “got get” Rudy Gobert. 2nd rd pick protected 31-58 though should get it done.
Chicago gave the wizards Rudy gobert for free ?
"C'mon, obviously the implication coming from OP's comment, which is that 'Rudy doesn't do this!' on a post about the rival DPOY candidate who are in the midst of a contentious race, is that this is a strong argument for Simmons &gt; Rudy.  Then Sixers flairs below go on to flat out state that Gobert is essentially just a rim protector. Don't be intentionally obtuse and act like we don't know what we're talking about here.  Whatever helps you cope with the fact that none of yall players aren't winning any awards this year... not DPOY, not MVP, not a Larry O'Brien, etc..."
Rudy Gobert gonna turn into Rudy Gay
I know this is a Sixers post but y'all responded so viscerally to basic logic and facts that it's hilarious.   I have no dog in this fight (not a Jazz fan whatsoever) but I just wanted to correct this dumb implication that Simmons doing one thing that Gobert doesn't do as well is a profound point against Rudy or something
Gobert still won on narrative that year. Jazz were a lottery team while he was out and when he came back they went on a tear and were the best defensive team in the league. Embiid still was neck and neck with him that year cause he had more games played but when he got hurt at the end of the year and ended playing almost the same number of games as Gobert it was no contest. So comparing it to this year where Rudy hasn't missed nearly as much time as Embiid and has generally been the better defender isn't the same
"Jazz fans love him, but Rudy Gobert has to be the most overhated person on /r/NBA in general."
"&gt; they could probably save money on trophy engravings by just doing a bulk order of ""Rudy Gobert"" DPOYs  Hey now, the year's not over yet. They might disqualify him if it turns out he did the holocaust or smth. Otherwise yeah, it feels like he's got DPOY in the bag."
Rudy Gobert is quite good at basketball
Haha I had Gobert in Sabonis in 100% of my fantasy lineups    I watch a lot of Pacers games and Brogdon is so terrible and he really hates Sabonis. Sabonis runs a pick and roll every possession and puts his hands up and Brogdon ignores him. Figured Brogdon would actually have to give him the ball and not chuck against Rudy and it paid off big $$$$
"Nobody is taking Rudy Gobert seriously as an MVP candidate even though he is clearly more valuable rn than Mitchell. You’re right, time to stop discussing"
"Rudy, and I cannot express this enough, Gobert."
"1) i hope donovan is good to go for the playoffs  2) they could probably save money on trophy engravings by just doing a bulk order of ""Rudy Gobert"" DPOYs. No one is even close to in his league on defense and no one is going to have a sniff at the DPOY for a few years"
Rudy Gobert literally said “fuck it this game is mine” in the second half.
Rudy Gobert is just incredible
Rudy Gobert. There's probably like 5 things that he does better than any other player in the NBA but lots of people like to focus on what he can't do.
Why do you talk about the best defender ever but then bring up Rudy Gobert and not Georges Niang
"If you were to ask the casual NBA fan who Rudy Gobert was, they probably wouldn’t even know who he is. Yet alone people who don’t follow sports knowing who he is. Guys like Lebron and Steph are celebrities, those are people casuals and people who don’t follow sports know. Rudy Gobert is not a celebrity in this country lol.   I didn’t say the NBA isn’t culturally impactful, I just said it’s not as impactful as you think it is. Most of the country isn’t following the NBA that closely."
"It couldn't be that I appreciate could defenders, could it? I also talk up Rudy Gobert because of how insane he is."
&gt; The entire world didn’t shut down because Rudy Gobert tested positive  The NBA shutting down was the trigger for the country to (halfheartedly) take the thing seriously though. That's the point OP's trying to make.
The Rudy Gobert special!
Not unless Rudy Gobert dies.
My take for the last year was that Rudy gobert saved America by touching the microphones last year. We wouldn’t have taken that shit nearly as seriously without that.
I can give you a player who is generally disliked except a couple of fanbases  - Rudy Gobert.
Yeah to Rudy gobert but not in this quote
"We were also absolutely dreadful when Rudy was out, whereas the Sixers have still been really good even when Embiid’s been injured. That injury actually helped Rudy’s case because it reminded everyone that we were the worst defense in the league before Gobert."
"""Certain stats are cool with certain players"" is certainly one way of saying ""every single stat says rudy gobert is better and makes his teams defense better than I do"""
1. Nikola Jokic 2. Joel Embiid 3. Rudy Gobert 4. Karl Anthony Towns 5. Bam Adebayo 6. Kristaps Porzingis 7. Domantas Sabonis 8. Nikola Vucevic 9. Clint Capela 10. Jusuf Nurkic 11. Myles Turner 12. Christian Wood 13. Jonas Valanciunas 14. Brook Lopez 15. DeAndre Ayton
Numbers are pointless if you don’t have a positive impact. Ayton’s numbers are starting to go up now but he’s made an impact all season. Rudy Gobert puts up solid numbers but it’s his impact that made him an all-star.   Whiteside puts up empty numbers similarly to Drummond. He balled out in his contract year and then forgot to play lol.
"That game, even though we lost, cemented for me that this is Rudy's team. Everyone was on their last legs, both teams were out of gas and the last two men trading blows were future MVP Jokic and Rudy Gobert."
"IMO this was far less humiliating than other Steph plays like when he made CP3 sit the fuck down or that time he made Rudy Gobert absolutely lost in space, spinning out of control lolz."
Rudy Gobert has underrated defensive IQ. People give too much credit to his height and wingspan. Just being tall and raising your hands up isn't enough to be elite defender as demonstrated by Hasheem Thiabeet and Mo Bambo.
"Lets establish something:  Rudy &gt; Mitchell for MVP case.  Jokic &gt;&gt;&gt; Rudy for MVP case.  If Jokic is so far ahead of Gobert that there's no convo to begin with, then there's no convo for Mitchell either."
"Here are other things that objectively help make someone the best scorer: having other reliable scorers on the team, not expending a lot of energy on defense, good range, ability to draw fouls, ability to finish under pressure.   A lot of things can contribute to someone being a good scorer. Yet people cling to efficiency like it’s the determining factor.   Rudy Gobert leads the league is FG% this season."
"It’s not all eye test. If the stat sheet shows Rudy Gobert with 7 3PA in a game, I’m not think “well were they open?”   I’m being tongue in cheek obviously. The eye test can do a lot for shot selection, but stats can be applied too. That’s why we don’t have a lot of long 2s now. The league realized they aren’t as valuable.  That’s stats."
I think people seem to like Don more because he is a closer but Rudy is unquestionably the better player. So it doesn't make any sense that Mitchell should be in MVP convo. I think Gobert has been a fringe top 10 player though. The results speak for themselves.
Rudy Gobert MVP?  lmap
"I guess Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green, and Kawhi Leonard are just scrubs huh?"
Can he become the short rudy gobert is the real question.
James Harden and Rudy Gobert. It’s a shame that despite cycling through multiple guys at the position we haven’t found even a decent lob thrower at guard to pair with Rudy. Harden or Paul could get Rudy to 20 points per 36.
Better: Ben Simmons     Worse: Rudy Gobert
Ben Simmons Rudy Gobert
no he isnt lol. gobert is 100%. unless you mean 'best' as in most skilled i guess? which is meaningless. the jazz's most valuable player is rudy gobert.
"Jazz fans, is he the #1 guy or Rudy Gobert? Everytime i go deep into a thread it is Rudy but the top comments are Mitchell."
"Not that any of this has something to do with the topic, but he didn’t give his team COVID. They (including Rudy) almost certainly got it from Christian Wood, who they played a few games earlier while he was knowingly playing with flu-like symptoms. He tested positive right after Rudy did.   Ya’ll want Gobert to be the villain, but Christian Wood was the real irresponsible one and is almost certainly NBA patient zero.   (To be clear I’m not defending Rudy’s mic touching stunt, that was very stupid, but ain’t what shut down the NBA or gave anyone COVID.)"
"Rudy ""i'm silently confident thats why i post it on my biggest social media platform"" Gobert"
Oh damn did not know that. Tho he was a center so he only had to compete against deandre jordan and rudy gobert lol.
rudy gobert lmao
Because Rudy Gobert is known for his team defense while Ben is known for his individual defense ...
"Lol nobody gives a shit about that, Ben Wallace anchored a championship defense and another finals appearance plus multiple ECF. All gobert has done is get punked round one every year. Rudy isn’t close"
"Rudy’s very likely to get in, and is closing in on Wallace in awards very quickly. Wallace has 4 DPOYs, 6 all defensive teams (5 first team), 4 all stars, and 5 all nba selections. In all likelihood, after this season Rudy will be at 3 DPOYs, 5 all defense (all first team), 4 all nba, and 2 all stars (though it should be more). Gobert just needs one more season of his current level to essentially match Wallace for career individual accolades. Rudy’s also just 28, which is young for a defensive center. At the end of his age 28 season Wallace had 2 all nba, 2 DPOY, 2 all defensive and 1 all star appearance."
Best league ever  1 - Anthony Davis + LeBron James  2 - Giannis Antetokounmpo + Luka Doncic  3 - Joel Embiid + James Harden  4 - Nikola Jokic + Kawhi Leonard  5 - Kevin Durant + Steph Curry  6 - Rudy Gobert + Jimmy Butler + Damian Lilard  7 - Bam Adebayo + Paul George + Kyrie Irving  8 - Karl Anthony Towns + Jayson Tatum + Ben Simmons  9 - Draymond Green + Devin Booker + Chris Paul  10 - Kristaps Porzingis + Zion Williamson + Donovan Mitchell  11 - Clint Capela + Jaylen Brown + Bradley Beal
Rudy Gobert ? Because if Ben Wallace can't get in and Gobert is getting I'm gonna lose my mind.  But of the top 15/20 players he seems like the most probable since everybody gets in nowadays (besides Ben Wallace)
"He scored 42 on the Jazz, not on Gobert   Simmons is underplaying his hand   Ben is a beast and I dont see many bigs that can shut him down   He is as prolific as Steph just in a completely different way   that being said:   Rudy Gobert is the DPOY, hands down - no questions"
I'm not saying Gobert impacts the game in ways that don't matter but don't you think he has a weakness to quick guards/guards with a good midrange? Yall definitely aren't the same team as you've been the last few years cause your offense is a million times harder to guard but I do wonder when Rudy plays like ad + bron and Schroeder how he'll do
"Yeah, that is how it works. You play tight on the perimeter to deny the three, that gives the offense the ability to get into the lane where Rudy is waiting. It is on purpose. Deny the 3, allow long 2's or contested shots against Gobert or Favors."
Rudy gobert and Clint capela are probably the two centers that dominate in the pick in roll
"I know I’m late to this, and I do agree with you that Myles is still a ways off of Rudy Gobert, but man you’re selling Myles extremely short trying to put him as just a shot blocker, but your post seems to be based on eye test alone.  There are nights when I myself get frustrated watching Myles and how he gets bullied by stronger bigs.  But every time you look at the stats Myles is damn near top 3 in every major defensive metric.  I’m not just talking RAPTOR/advanced analytics, but things like opponent fg% at the rim, on/off team defensive rating, etc. There was even a post in this sub just the other day showing that Myles is statistically the best pick n roll defending big in the league.  He is absolutely a defender on the same level as Simmons, Capela and Holiday, and is statistically a top 3 defender in the league this year.  Saying he makes no sense for DPOY and then saying guys like Jrue, Capela and Simmons do is just crazy talk.  My vote still goes to Rudy, but I think you’re underselling what Turner brings to the table here."
"&gt; Most valuable .   What the literal fuck are you responding to at this point?  Do you actually think I'm arguing Gobert should be MVP?  Do you literally not know how to read?  &gt;I said he’s overrated in the aspect of winning an award twice when he’s just a great shot blocker, not the best defensive player.  You said he was 'not defensive player of the year.'  You also said he was 'overrated as this elite defender.'  He has two DPOY awards, probably three soon, so the first bit is factually wrong.    The second bit just proves you don't watch basketball tbh.    &gt;So yes again, lol you are proving my point.  I'm sure on some planet your debating style is impressive, but your weak link is: this is Earth.      &gt;And for my javale point? He was averaging the same amount of blocks per game as Gobert was for a 3 year period.  A.) That's a shit point.  Only an idiot would think that same number of blocks = equally good at rim protection.  Like... you're literally arguing that Javale McGee was as good a rim protector as Rudy Gobert.  That's just dumb.      B.) You're also shit at explaining your points.    At this point I think it's pretty clear there's no point talking to you further, because god *damn* this is getting stupid."
"Not only that, they also saw James Harden play Rudy Gobert off the court in the postseason years ago, players think that if you are a DPOY that shouldn't be possible.  And yes Jazz fans, it happened, watch that series again and see Harden hunting Gobert like he was playing against an injured player and leading Houson to massive runs everytime Gobert was on the floor."
It’s currently based around that because Rudy Gobert exists. With Draymond it takes on a different dimension.   Have you watched Draymond as a short roll passer in the Warriors? One of the greatest literally or the modern era. He was a more impactful offensive player than Klay literally solely because of his passing as a roll man.

"&gt;Bro, stop lying. I said playoff trips. We were talking about their performance in the playoffs.  Thankfully, I am not your ""bro"".  Grow up.  And we were precisely talking about the fact that Drummond and Davis made exactly the same number of playoff trips before joining the Lakers.  &gt;You’re really trying to say 13 points on 10 attempts is good for a center.   Do the simple arithmetic, if you can.  That's a 65% effective FG%, which would be second all-time in NBA history.  &gt;Rudy Gobert, a non scoring center by design scores just as many points on 3+ less attempts.  Gobert's career effective FG% is 64.5%, or slightly worse than 13 points on 10 attempts.  &gt; Embiid gets 25+ on 3+ more attempts while shooting 3s as well.   Embiid's career effective FG% is 51.9%, which equates to a bit over 10 points on 10 attempts.  &gt; TS% is superior and always will be, especially in this case.   Not when you are claiming that Drummond misses so many shots from the floor.  Which was, again, nonsense.  &gt;The fact that he doesn’t take 3s yet has a 54% eFg on that many attempts clearly indicates he’s inefficient.   With no respect at all, you haven't the slightest idea what you are talking about.  &gt; I can’t do math   There's a shock.  You fundamentally misunderstand the statistics you are spouting, and again, you lack the slightest idea what you are talking about.  TS% and eFG% have nothing at all to do with risk, they involve simple arithmetic that you can neither understand, nor perform.  &gt; Watch more basketball   I'm sure I've seen and played more than you have, kid."
Nobody shuts down more NBA teams than Rudy Gobert.
And saying that twice doesn't automatically make everyone agree with that.  Here's another opinion: Ben Simmons ain't close to Rudy Gobert in DPOY this year as well

"Um, metrics can be flawed? They're just as much a stat as anything else. For EXAMPLE, RAPTOR has Clint Capela as the 7th best player in the league right now. It also has Rudy Gobert as the 2nd.  I think it's weird to remember ppls usernames on an anonymous forum but u can do u. I don't hate LeBron, I think he's the best player in the league rn and top 3 all time depending on who you ask. I still think he's a hypocrite and way too concerned about his image! Not sure how this is relevant to a Westbrook discussion, as people judge Westbrook's PLAY unfairly while you're arguing people judge LeBron's CHARACTER unfairly (which is a completely different discussion)"
"oh there is. anybody who puts russ over rudy gobert is just wrong and doesn't know what they're talking about. which is fine, nothing wrong with being a casual fan who only understands certain aspects of the game and not the fact that gobert has been one of the most valuable players this season  but you're also the dude who was trying to use FG% yesterday in the evaluation of a player who shoots many 3s. so i shouldnt be surprised"
"One should apply some era adjustment to this stat.  Interior defense in the NBA is worse than it ever has been, by leaps and bounds.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four all-time in effective FG% in the NBA.  All are obviously active players.  Of the top 20 all-time, 12 are active."
"&gt;mchale would smoke most bigs today with his post moves  Everyone would.  Interior defense doesn't even exist in the NBA anymore.  DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, and Montrezl Harrell are numbers one, two, three, and four all-time in effective field-goal percentage.  Of the top 20 all-time, 12 are currently active.  The biggest challenge McHale -- or anyone else -- would have is getting teammates to pass him the ball, instead of jacking up threes."
Ben Simmons hate =/= Rudy Gobert love haha
[More Seriouser] Is Rudy Gay gobert?
Is Rudy Gay gobert?
Is Rudy Gay Gobert?
"Yeah Bias is up there (top 3 what if imo)but Bird broke his pack cuz he did his moms house landscaping by himself, which kinda was the last straw. Parish was getting old and Mchale was still pretty good but regressing. Sure Bias woulda curbed that regression let’s say 2 years. So that’s 4 more years of competitive play for the Celtics in terms of title contention.   In Sabonis case: he joins a Blazers team that goes to 2 finals without him, has a handful of 50+ win seasons without him, drexler most likely doesn’t leave to Houston cuz he has himself a dominant big. With drexler porter and Sabonis that’s 2 Mvp/upper level all star caliber players and a fringe all star caliber player on the same team from a young age and presumably through their primes. Did I mention the west was fairly weak in the 80s so that helps their success for the first 4 seasons Sabonis is there. Sabonis individually was Built like current Rudy Gobert, the passing ability and vision of Jokic, solid shooter, excellent post up game, and he was 75% as athletic as David Robinson, in other words the 1st OG unicorn"
"Everyone knows Olynyk can bomb it from three, but in 21 games with Houston he's shooting **70.8% from two**.   I don't think people understand just how ridiculous that is for a guy who isn't a dunker, or even for a guy who IS a dunker. Rudy Gobert currently leads the league at 68.2% and that's with 208 dunks in 63 games. Kelly Olynyk has 8 dunks in 21 games. Houston-Olynyk's 2P% is higher than the career best seasons for Rudy Gobert and Tyson Chandler."
Rudy Gobert
i hear rudy gobert is a fan of spreading covid around
"When Rudy Gobert tells Jazz fans to calm down on Twitter, the Jazz play better."
"Argue semantics all you want but prime Kevin Durant is more valuable than Rudy Gobert, exponentially.  Ever since KD left Westbrook has won been a routine first round exit in 5 games. He has done less with more his entire career than Iverson.  Iverson wins a championship if he gets to play with Durant, Harden, Paul George and Bradley Beal throughout his career"
"&gt;And the idea that defense isn’t dependent upon athleticism is highly flawed also - defense is a young mans game.  I know it looks like I'm just coming to bat for the Heat flair here, but... I can give you proof that it isn't. Iguodala and Ariza are 37 and 35. They're both still plus defenders, with the latter being a starting PF on a defensively-minded roster. In last year's finals, Iguodala was constantly given tough assignments and was key to the run. If you're like Giannis, defense can be dependent upon athleticism. You don't contest shots from as far as he does if you're built like Klay. The thing is, Klay isn't reliant on athleticism to play defense; not as his primary method of defending. He's someone who could age well even with injuries because he wasn't supremely athletically gifted (of course he's athletically gifted he's an NBA all-star but i mean like relative to Rudy Gobert who is the length of a compact car) and relies mostly on being smart/knowing how to use what he already has.  Klay hasn't had any favors done for him by getting injured, but he's not gonna be some minus-defender spot-up shooter upon return. I don't know where the other guy is getting ""2 major injuries &gt; 82 games of wear-and-tear"" from, though. I see the idea he has, but I don't really agree."
Rudy Gobert + Donovan Mitchell  (thanks again Denver)
Damn you’re mad you got Donovan Mitchell and Rudy gobert on max deals...I get it
"&gt; You just dismissed it with- oh but it was months ago when he was a liability  You're dismissing what I said like it's not totally true though. You act like MPJ went from ""played off the floor bad"" to ""can now capably defend one of the greatest players ever"" in the span of a few months, and you're hanging your hat on that argument like it's just solid reasoning.   You don't seem to be aware that playoff basketball is *totally* different than regular season basketball, because weaknesses get exploited so much more in the postseason when teams and coaches can lock in and specifically game plan for a team they're playing over and over for the next two weeks. MPJ won't be able to simply hide in the playoffs the way he has in the regular season. If there is a weak link on the court on either end for a team, then a good opponent will lean on it until it breaks.  If MPJ can't totally stop LeBron, then LeBron is gonna target him every trip down the floor, just like he did last year. If that happens, what is Denver's back up plan? Are they just as good if they have to sit MPJ in crunch time because he's a huge defensive liability? I feel like as a Denver fan you're about to find out.  The teams that win big in the postseason are the ones that can run out 5 man lineups where nobody is a liability on either end. Most people don't seem to grasp this, but if one of your key guys has a glaring weakness at one end or the other then it's gonna be really hard to beat other great teams who don't have that problem. This is what people don't get when they look at great players like Dame Lillard or Rudy Gobert, who are magnificent on one end, but who can be easily exploited on the other. We saw it with MPJ last year in the WCF after he played so well against the Clippers, because against the Lakers Denver just had to pull him out of the games cause he was killing them with his lack of defense. Is that just magically gone now a few months later? I doubt it."

Rudy Gobert would be a good player to add for contrast to demonstrate some of the points you’re trying to make
"That isn't the definition that anyone goes by at all. All-star is top 26 players. Even if you're going by top 15, all-nba is top 15 and Rudy has made it 3 out of the last 4 years at one of the most contested positions, and is about to make it again. The one year he wasn't all-nba was the year he missed significant time injured and still was DPOY. Rudy Gobert is absolutely a star unless you're specifically moving the goalposts to exclude him from the definition."
"""I Hate Rudy Gobert"" -Durants_Superteam"
I think it can go either way. Personally I see Don as there best player but you could make the same case for Gobert. I don’t blame Jazz fans for backing there guy either. He’ll probably get DPOY this year because he’s putting up incredible numbers and the Jazz record.   Btw between Bam &amp; Rudy who do you think is better? Just curious lol.

Someone in Facebook said he'd rather have Andre Drummond over Rudy Gobert lmao
"Pascal Siakam is exactly the kind of player that Rudy Gobert could guard, wym."
"Most of it is just due to selection bias tbh. 90%+ of every highlight posted here involving Gobert is someone making a great offensive play against Rudy. So if you only watch highlights, of course you’ll think Rudy isn’t actually a good defender. And since the Jazz aren’t on National TV much, the vast majority of people mostly see Gobert via highlights. There’s also been a stigma about Gobert’s perimeter defense since the Steph clip, and there’s a confirmation bias of posting every play where a guard scores on Rudy. People have this perception that guys like AD or Bam are better perimeter defenders than Rudy even though the objective numbers show that’s not true, and that perception stays because every time Bam gets scored on on the perimeter it isn’t an r/nba highlight.   Selection bias in media is super powerful. ~50 people a year in the US die from lightning strikes. I guarantee if every time it happened (about once a week) it were national news, there’d be a large segment of people who thought that lightning strikes were a serious threat to their everyday safety. There’s been a serious selection bias against Rudy for awhile and it’s affected how people view him. The only way to fix it is for a deep jazz playoff run so non jazz fans will watch and extended amount of uninterrupted Rudy play instead of just the times he gets scored on, which is gonna happen when you defend the most shots in the league."
"oh man, everyone in the league gets some good schaudenfreude whenever Gobert gets drawn out to the perimeter by a good guard. and guards be licking their chops whenever it happens. rudy is a total newborn giraffe when he's out there."
Rudy Gobert: hands like feet.
"rudy gobert is an amazing player and the most impactful Jazzman. he’s also incredibly fun to pick on bc he has funny lowlights, and jazz fans get really defensive about him. honestly they’re way more defensive about rudy than spida lmao"
But they still have MVP candidate Rudy Gobert...
"Sure, you could argue that, especially Mutombo. It’s really hard to compare eras. I’m not sure Wallace would ever be very effective on offense given how limited and terribly inefficient he was. I will say all three of them were also less efficient relative to the field compared to Gobert today. Again, not saying Rudy is some gifted offensive player, but he’s very effective at playing his role."
"Rudy leaves the paint, CP3 misses by half a mile, easiest oREB of the suns life.......... Thats the reason Gobert doesn't leave the paint."

"Rudy Gobert Playoff LEBRON from 2018-2020: [+0.89 60th in the NBA +0.83 on defense](https://www.bball-index.com/playoff-lebron-database/).   Rudy Gobert 3 yr PIPM in the [reg season](https://www.bball-index.com/multi-year-lebron/): +4.95 18th in the NBA.   It's still a only a 23 year sample size in the playoffs he can definitely improve it and change things. But it's a big enough drop off it's a valid reservation. Note Im using LEBRON because that's the only metric I can see in a quick search that has playoff specific data, if any of those other ones do you're welcome to post it and we can compare."
"Superstars  transcend their sport and crossover into other aspects of pop culture. Rudy Gobert, though a star in the nba, is not a superstar."
"By that metric, Rudy Gobert qualifies because of the coronavirus debacle last year."
Haha Rudy Gobert isn’t a superstar. The man gets played off the floor by a spacing center or a small ball 5 every playoff series. If he was a superstar the jazz would be favorites but they’re not even the 3rd best team in the west
Yea but a C who can anchor your defense while being efficient on offense is extremely rare to find -- Rudy Gobert just got a near supermax filling that role.
If we awarded mvp based on record alone then Rudy Gobert or Chris Paul would win. The reality is there is a gigantic gap between Curry and Randle individually that even team record doesn’t make up for.
If he’s impacting the game like a superstar then he’s a superstar lol. Rudy Gobert does not impact the game like a superstar
"There wasn't even a second in my life when I thought of Rudy Gobert as a superstar. No offense to Rudy, no pun intended."
"It's interesting when Ben did his top 10 player rankings last yr he said for the 10th spot the evidence, the impact metrics, his initial evaluation would tell him to put Rudy in the 10th spot for last season. But just his general gut about the value of bigs and if those metrics slightly inflate them and if Gobert's value diminishes a little in the playoffs he said was enough to drop him out of the top 10.  But it kind of also shows it's all relative. For someone like Ben those concerns are enough to drop Gobert out of the ""top 10"". The way people talk about Rudy it's like they think those concerns are enough that he isnt a top 30 player in the NBA or isnt a star level player."

Rudy Gobert
"I think that its Rudy Gobert.   Sure, he is an allstar. But he did it by playing like a role player. He's a pick and roll, rim running, rim protector, big man.   He is playing a very defined role and doing it at an elite level."
No one is scared of teams without superstars. Maybe in the regular season they are the best but the playoffs are a different game. The jazz maybe scary to some but rudy gobert and mitchell just isn't a championship duo in my eyes. The sun's are pretty young and a lot of their key pieces haven't even played in a single playoff game. Even with the clippers short comings last year I would still take them over both teams.
Still my opinion that Rudy gobert is a role player and is the best in the league. He’s a rim runner and pick and roll defender.
"Rudy Gobert is definitely one of them.  I'm kidding guys, put away your pitchforks. I'd probably choose the same 3 as OP."
MVP by screen assists: Rudy Gobert  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/hustle/?sort=SCREEN_ASSISTS&amp;dir=1
"We are talking about 2016, Draymond green was a better overall offensive player than current Rudy Gobert. How many ppg Draymond is averaging in 2021 has no relevance to this conversation at all. He was one of the best passing bigs in the league and a solid shooter along with the best defensive player in the league.   Clearly you think Klay was better than Drayond which is fine, Klay is great. I would take 2016 Draymond though and just didn't understand a vague definiton of 2nd banana that would have you select the inferior player because he scores more. That was my main gripe.   Your original comment said ""2nd banana isn't 2nd best"" so that's what i was trying to respond to and get to the bottom of how you would define the term and draw the line."
It’s most definitely Rudy Gobert among NBA fans
"Yeah a lot have been great defensive players but most of them can also score well or at least decently. I need you to understand that Rudy Gobert, the defensive specialist from your example, is scoring 8 more ppg this season than Draymond.  Klay is an insane scorer and a very good defender. Any team would take him over Draymond Green. I just entertained your ""Draymond is better"" idea because his unique style of play is a big part of what enables the Warriors' extremely successful motion offence and their ability to defend properly while playing small ball."
"The opinion of one basketball analytics expert is not the be all end all. Defensive metrics are difficult, by that does not make advanced defensive metrics worthless. Also, when a number of different advanced metrics with different methodologies all point to the same player as being the best defender, it strongly suggests that player is the leagues best defender. Individual metrics have their flaws, but the flaws are different and the fact they point to the same player is very telling.  The fact you think Simmons put up 40 on Rudy or that Jokic neutralized Goberts value last year shows just how little you know.  Gobert was not primarily defending Simmons. Simmons went 3/9 for 11 points with 3 turnovers when Gobert was the primary defender. Clarkson scored 40 in that game and Utah dropped 135, so I guess all that blame falls on Simmons? No? Then Simmons dropping 40 is not automatically on Gobert, either.  Jokic had a great series but that doesnt mean Gobert didnt. Gobert was one of the best players all series. You need to move past this idea that a center having a good game against Utah means that Gobert was neutralized. Gobert is more of an off ball floating rim protector than a one-on-one player. A center can play well against them and Gobert can still be one of the most valuable players on the court.  A number of teams would have given Gobert the max no hesitation. All time level defender who is underrated offensively, no brainer max deal. Top 10 impact player on the entire league.   The Jazz have only been bounced in the first round as a underdog. They will not be an easy out this season and don't be surprised if they walk away with the title."
Not a strawman. Second option actually means second scoring option. No one has ever called Rudy Gobert the first option even though he’s the best player on the Jazz.
I don’t think any of those guys are over/underrated.   I.e. I think they get the proper amount of love and attention.   Westbrook is Westbrook. He’s had a stellar past few games but has been inconsistent this year and the early part of the year wasn’t doing so hot.  Kleber has intangibles but it doesn’t matter what you provide if it doesn’t show up on a stat sheet.. his 3p% is great on decent attempts per game. His defensive rating is ok-ish and his offensive rating is alright. His per 36 is worse this year than last year so take that for what you will.  Rudy Gobert is neither over or underrated. He’s a prototypical big that puts up DPOY level interior defense... that’s what he does not much else to say about it.   Demar Derozan.. if he added a 3 pointer to his repertoire he would be a killer. His draw foul on the drive game is incredible and he’s got the mid range down. But he’s not all nba.. yet.. he is too small and not a tank like Zion so he has to be crafty to get to the rim.. it would help him to be able to hit a 3 on 35% 3-4 attempts a game.   I agree with Tobias harris...  I think the most under appreciated players are almost always role players or borderline all star players on small market teams...  I.e. Brandon Ingram put up all star numbers this year but didn’t make the all star game. Same with de Aaron fox who got snubbed for all star reserves this year.
"From fans: Ben Simmons, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert"
"All of your points lack critical context. Rudy is entering that all time tier. No one wins 3 DPOYs and isn't there.  Wallace did not lock up perimeter players. Curry would spin him around as quick as Gobert. Gobert also has largely lowered perimeter shot percentages of perimeter players for a couple years now as well.  Wallace did not dominate Shaq. Shaqs averages in the finals against him we're still ridiculous.  Being athletic is great but not really an argument for anyone and not like his athletism somehow is more valuable than Rudy's length.  Ben had another DPOY level player on his team. No team around Rudy was as good as Prince, Sheed, Rip, and Chauncey collectively. You replace the two and the Pistons still win that championship and go to those ECF. Put even this Jazz team in that run of bad Eastern Conferences they make those easily as well.   Bringing up points allowed knowing the much lower pace of Ben's era and one play in a career when Ben I'm sure made plenty of his own is just arguing in bad faith already"
Individual offensive rating is next to useless as a metric to judge a players offensive impact. Rudy Gobert is literally the all time leader in offensive rating lmfao. If you're gonna cite advanced stats at least cite a useful one like OBPM (which Kobe has the edge in)
"Defensively...   Gobert, amazing. O'Neale and Favs, solid. Conley, solid but short. Jingles, average. Mitchell, Clarkson, Bojan, Niang, below average. I know our defensive gameplay is predicated on funneling shots into Gobert but it also is designed to cover up how weak some of our perimeter defense gets. Rudy ends up having to contest so many 1v2's with minimal help it's a testament to his ability that his allowed FG% is as good as it is.  Also, our rebounding and rim protection outside of Rudy is pretty bad. (O'Neale is 6'4"" and our best rebounder after Gobert/Favors, he's second in RPG.) Our wings are unathletic, which is not always an issue, but when we're up against like PG13 and Kawhi or LeBron/AD/Gasol, our defensive flexibility will be crazy tested. It's also why when we go against rangy bigs (Jokic, AD) who pull Gobert out of the paint, our defense can give up a lot in a hurry."
"Is Rudy Gobert the best defender in history?  Because that’s the tier he’d be in if you want to say he’s next to Wallace. Wallace locked up perimeter players, dominant big men like Shaq, held opponents under 70 points regularly, had seasons where he averaged 3 blocks a game, had insane mobility, insane athleticism, benched 460. Gobert meets people at the rim by sheer length, Wallace’s blocks were predicated more on his absurd hand-eye coordination on defense.  Rudy didnt play on teams as good as the Pistons because he’s not good enough to elevate his teams to that level. Big Ben was the best player on a team that reached 6 straight conference finals.   I’ve watched Ben Wallace. I’ve watched Rudy Gobert. There’s no comparison. Wallace would never leave the paint wide open because of a pump fake by the inbounder in the last possession of a game, like Rudy did last game."
"“This article was not intended to argue for Defensive Player of the Year on Adebayo’s behalf (Rudy Gobert is a heavy favorite to win his third trophy). But, at the same time, it’s impossible to say with 100% certainty or confidence that anyone else is more complete on that side of the ball. Adebayo simply doesn’t surface as often as he should in these debates, so, in the spirit of highlighting one of this season’s most overlooked and distinct individual efforts, here is that very argument!”"
Bill Russell is basically Rudy Gobert
You are looking at this from an entirely different (and erroneous) perspective.    I understand how the supermax works yet you still keep trying to explain it to me. That doesn’t change the fact that Rudy Gobert isn’t worth that kind of money. Gobert is not worth 33 nor is he worth 40 mil a year. I would say in today’s nba he is worth roughly around what Draymond Green is worth. You aren’t ever going to be an actual title contender paying Gobert north of 30mil a year unless he is somehow your 3rd option and your other 2 stars are AD and LeBron. It’s just way too much money.    Also the supermax still impacts how much salary cap you have to allot to potential free agent signings. My argument is that Rudy Gobert + another max star player + vet minimums are not enough to win you a title. That’s the claim I am making.    The jazz did a pseudo win now move to appease their fans but they aren’t actual contenders. Rudy Gobert is not a modern center and that roster as presently constructed is not good enough to make it out of the west let alone to win a ring.
The Utah Jazz are not winning a title paying Rudy Gobert a Supermax contract. He is not worth it.    The supermax was designed for small market teams to be competitive in retaining their superstar players. Rudy gobert juuuuuust checked the boxes for it and was eligible for it so they got cucked into a position where they couldn’t let him walk.    You aren’t winning a title paying Rudy gobert 40mil a year.
Taking Noah on 9/10 teams forsure. Very different players but Noah had an amazing defensive impact as well as offensively. Noah never compared in terms of rim protection but he just contributed in so many ways in his prime I don’t think I could choose Gobert over him and that’s no slight to Rudy.
Rudy Gobert is DPOY   lol
"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n05rw4/oc_gobert_vs_simmons_based_on_adjusted_plusminus/  Forgot to reply earlier but this is another good thread pointing it out. Gobert leads the league in defensive advanced metrics (and to an extent all advanced metrics) by a wide margin.   But to answer your question about what he's unmatched at, it's just rim protection. He is quite literally unmatched. There are good defensive centers in the league, Embiid among them. Embiid is not in the same tier of rim protector as Rudy.   Consider that on an average night, Rudy is playing next to four average at best defenders (conley, bojan, mitchell, o neale, clarkson, ingles), with o'neale being the best of the bunch. Despite that, The jazz are amongst the most efficient defensive teams in the league (top 3 drtg). Rudy doesn't just deny shots (he's leading the league in blocks), he's alters shots that occur near him and forces more shots to occur in the inefficient midrange. Rudy's defensive presence is so strong, it bleeds over to his teammates who are able to close out on 3 point shooters more efficiently, leading to the Jazz allowing the fewest 3PA of any team in the league. Purely because otherwise average defenders are able to close out knowing Rudy has their backs.   You really just cannot look at a guy like Simmons who guards one guy (yes, extremely well) and compare him to a guy like Gobert who alters the shot profiles of every single player on the court for the entire time he is out there. I don't know how to prove I'm not blowing smoke up your ass, other than to say that Rudy leads the league in almost every advanced stat for a reason. When a guy who has a very limited offensive game is leading the league in RPM and EPM, it should be very clear that his defense is out of this world."
Rudy Gobert. You can barely play him most of the time in the playoffs
"I think the idea of a floor/ceiling raiser is pretty convoluted and generally not meaningful. Either someone is good and they help you win, or some one is bad and they don’t help you win. Right? But going along with the idea that there are floor raisers and there are ceiling raisers, Rudy Gobert is a floor raiser. You put him on any team in this league and that team automatically becomes a .500 ball club or better, I don’t care who else is on that team. Now take someone like Lebron. He goes to LA and year one they are still a bad team, he doesn’t raise their floor at all. The next year you add a guy like AD and that LA team is a decent team. Now you take that decent team and throw in LEBRON and they become an NBA Champion. Boom ceiling raiser."
"Cards on the table, I'm a huge Ben fan, but this is how I see it:  Rudy is the best defender in the most impactful position.  Ben is the best defender in a not as impactful position.   This means Rudy is the most important defender in the league.  As for who the better defender is? I'd say Ben due to his versatility and the fact no one in the league goes after him, whereas quicker guards will attack Gobert (not.just Dlo last night).  So it comes down to who you want to give the award to. The most important defender (Gobert) or the best defender (Ben).  In either case I don't think there is a robbery or a travesty, it will just be what people value the most."
"Prime Gasol was no joke. Rudy has the edge because of his mobility, but prime Gasol edges him on offense. Gasol made the all-nba 1st team, which is a testament of him being the best big man at one point.   However, Gobert is being more dominant right now. Nobody is going for layups when he is around, and us frenchies are loving it ! I'd still take Marc for the whole package and because he had the Andrew Bogut craftiness in passing the ball+bulk. Gobert isn't as esthaetically good, but he gets the job done like nobody else in history.  Ultimately, it all depends on roster construction. I'd prob get Rudy if my team is full of shooters and  scorers who don't really play D, but Gasol is more like a championship winning center, since you can rely on him in big moments and has a way bigger skillset offensively."
Lol at people acting like Gasol was as good as Gobert on defense. Gasol was an incredible defender but Rudy is one of the best ever. Dudes about to win his 3rd DPOY
"Prime gasol not even a little bit close for me   Comparably close as interior defenders, gobert is a better lob threat and that’s where the conversation ends for things Rudy can do better than prime gasol"
"All season long I've said that Rudy gets it because the voters have to reward the Jazz with something as the best team this season. They have zero MVP candidates so giving the award to Gobert (who is integral to your defense and success) seems like the best way to do that.   You guys have dropped some games here lately. It's strange that Ben overtakes Gobert when he's been out for like ten days. I know the Sixers, led by Ben, stole everything from OKC last night, but it still seems like this is a clear case of Rudy losing it (for now) than Ben taking it."
"Conley didn't show switch he showed him to stay on KAT, but Gobert was stuck in the screen so he hedged KAT to force him out Gobert was on hedge supposed to recover and Mike to go back to his man/Russell, but Gobert got confused Mike saw he was not gonna recover and stayed on KAT, Rudy did worse thing hesitated and then went back to his man with Conley too far out to recover."
"&gt; If you swap Rudy with embiid or Giannis, the jazz are just as good defensively and are much better overall  You admit you barely watch the Jazz but you think you're qualified to make that assessment? You're just wrong, I don't know what else to tell you. Go watch some Jazz games and come back.   If you want to read up on some of what Gobert offers, this post this week was a good writeup:  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mwcbde/oc_rudy_gobert_rim_deterrence_and_roll_gravity/"
Try explaining to Jazz fans the fact that they overpaid Rudy Gobert. You'll *REALLY* start to see the delusion that exists within the fanbase. $41M/yr for 14/14. Lol.
"If a player is winning championships or getting your team to the NBA finals that is a ceiling raiser! A guy like Rudy Gobert is a perfect example of a floor raiser. A team with Rudy is always gonna make the playoffs, he’s just that good on defense. But Rudy does not have the ability to carry anyone through the playoffs, just not his skill set."
"Gobert is not far and away the best at what he does though, Embiid, Giannis, Bam, and Myles Turner are all very good at paint defense as well.  If you swap Rudy with embiid or Giannis, the jazz are just as good defensively and are much better overall.  Rudy’s a good defender, but he’s not irreplaceable.  And if Rudy is so great at what he does, and this huge impactful player, how come jazz fans weren’t that excited giving him a max."
Rudy can only do one thing at a high level but that one thing is something he's unmatched at to the point where it outweighs all the things Ben can do. Who cares if Ben is more versatile if Gobert is more impactful with the one thing he's elite at in particular?   A big man who protects the rim as well as do other little things well is typically more impactful than a wing defender who only can guard one player at a time. Gobert's defense impacts all 5 offensive players immensely.   You just have this casual mindset of analyzing defense to where you think the NBA is streetball where one dude picks up one dude 1-on-1 at all times and that's how you grade defense
"&gt;I don’t watch the jazz all too often  Yes, that's the case with pretty much everyone who has this opinion  &gt;I do notice every time embiid and jokic play against Rudy they have very good games  Embiid and Jokic are offensive superstars. They have good games against everybody. You're joking if you think Ben would stop Embiid from scoring.   &gt;his job is a lot easier than bens  I disagree, but it's irrelevant to DPOY anyways.  Ben is very good at guarding one player, but thinking that makes someone the DPOY demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of basketball offenses. Yes Ben is a very good defender, and then the opposing team forces a switch off of him and....? Rudy's gravity around the rim affects the play of all 5 players on the court. That's pretty much the end of the argument. Thinking he just gets a block occasionally is wild. Blocks are the least of what Gobert offers. He completely deters most players from taking shots near the rim"
"That is why I stated depending on team construction, which is why I used that example! so you are agreeing lol.    Even if you do what you suggested. 2 Gobert replacing Melo/Mcollum would still be better lol. You are missing the point. 2 Ben version of what you suggested is not giving you a top 3 defense with Kanter/Dame still playing. 2 Rudy Gobert will give you that, they just have to be rotated 24 mins each."
Rudy Gobert is one of the best defenders in the history of the NBA.  Ben Simmons is literally a nobody.   You people are crazy
"I mean 2 Simmons vs 2 Goberts is stupid because they do different things lol. Yes 2 wing defenders on the floor at the same time is better than 2 rim protectors on the floor at the same time.  It's pretty misleading to say that ""Rudy has to have a system built around his skills."" The whole reason the system even works is that Rudy Gobert is the system. They just funnel everyone in towards him. Who on the Jazz is an above average defender besides Gobert? And Gobert is mobile enough to hold up in some switches (not fast/tricky guards but few are), and he's without a doubt the best rim protector in the league.  Simmons has the safety net of Embiid at the rim. Gobert IS the safety net. If he messes up its a layup. Simmons is still really really good, but Gobert is an all-time great."
"No, he wanted Gobert to stay on KAT he is pointing at Goberts man, what he did is contain and was ready to recover if pass went to KAT. He was playing like this to buy time to Gobert to recover and to force entry pass to KAT further from basket, Rudy blew it up if deal on the bench was like Mike did on court."
"You can see Mike hesitate for one second waiting to see if Gobert can recover, when he realizes he wouldn’t my be able to he decided to cover KAT. Why Rudy followed him? Miscommunication."
Rudy Gobert is a rim protector except when he forgets to protect the rim
"Luka has always done poorly against Rudy. He tries to force the switch but doesn’t have enough to speed to actually beat Rudy. Luka’s career numbers against the jazz are his worst among all the western conference teams. The mavs offense lives off Lukas drive and kick game but we never help off three point shooters, so it’s a very good matchup for us and Rudy specially. Gobert does better against KP than any other center in the league"
"These takes tell me you're a casual fan and instead of letting it go, I'm bored right now so I'm going to be petty and explain to you precisely why you're wrong and why these takes are absolutely abysmal. Also, I've been meaning to compile this data anyways because these are common twitter/IG talking points that are not based in reality.  &gt;These guys feast on Gobert lmao   I'll link the head to head of each player against Gobert since 2016, as Gobert, Giannis and Jokic were extremely green the prior few seasons.   * Embid career and against Gobert (6 games, Jazz went 2-4, but only 2 were played in Utah):   |Career (Since 2016)|24.8/11.3/3.1|48/32/80 splits| |:-|:-|:-| |Vs. Gobert|**23.8**/12.8/3.0|***43***/31/79 splits|  * AD career and against Gobert since 2016 (10 games, Jazz went 6-4):  |Career (since 2016):|25.2/10.4/2.3|51/31/80 splits| |:-|:-|:-| |Vs. Gobert|**22.8**/10.1/2.5|***46***/34/85|  * Jokic career and against Gobert, both since 2016 when they each started getting good (and including one where Gobert held him to 2 points), 21 games, Jazz went 10-11:   |Career (Since 2016)|20.2/10.4/6.7|54/34/84| |:-|:-|:-| |Vs. Gobert|22.9/9.6/6.4|**51**/42/85|  * Giannis career and against Gobert (also both since 2016 when they each started getting good) 8 games, Jazz went 6-2:   |Career (Since 2016)|26.2/11.1/5.5|55/29/72| |:-|:-|:-| |Vs. Gobert|30.7/11.3/4.7|**52**/37/71|  CLEARLY, your takes are statistically wrong and you should feel bad. *Every single one of them were less efficient against Gobert*, with only Giannis scoring even significantly more than his average against him (they still lost to the Jazz). They all play well, but not better against Gobert. Top players will get theirs no matter who they're facing. Furthermore, Utah's strategy isn't to have Gobert shut down 1v1 players.   &gt;Ben Simmons said it best. ""He guarded me in Utah … I had 42 and apparently I'm not a scorer"". Lmao.  The single dumbest take. Rudy doesn't guard Ben. Rudy actually guarded Ben for 7 shots that game, he went [3/7](https://kslsports.com/457476/ben-simmons-on-dpoy-race-i-had-42-points-on-gobert/). Also, Clarkson had 40 in that game too. Does that mean that Simmons is a mediocre defender, as he can't guard a 6th man? No, obviously, to anyone who has even a remedial understanding of basketball.  &gt;He is elite defensively against mid level nba players. Nothing more.  Lol, the only team who has a career offensive rating above 110 against Rudy since 2013 is Toronto. Boston is second at 106. The most successful teams in that time period are: Warriors, Spurs, Clippers, Toronto, Houston. Their offensive ratings **since 2013** [are](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goberru01/splits/):  ||Warriors|Spurs|Clippers|Toronto|Houston| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |ORtg: |111.9|110.6|112.5|111.5|111.4| |ORtg vs Gobert:|**103**|**104**|**104**|113|**104**|  Oh, and lastly, his offensive rating against those teams are:   ||Warriors|Spurs|Clippers|Toronto|Houston| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Team DRtg: |106.5|106.2|107.85|107.1|108.8| |Gobert ORtg vs. them:|**131**|**114**|**131**|**119**|**118**|  Long story short, not only is Gobert a transcendent defender, he's the center point of Utah's offense and his presence leads to an extremely efficient and high-scoring offense. AKA... you're a casual, you should feel bad."
"Stupid argument because you are talking about player defense vs team defense.  Only two teams with a defense outside of the top 10 has ever won a ring.  And your DPOY argument is beyond moronic.  No one said DPOY = rings.  But being great at defense does.  GOAT list - MJ, LBJ, Magic, Kobe, Shaq, Tim Duncan, Wilt, Kareem, Bird, Moses, Dr J, Hakeem, etc etc etc - have all been named to NBA all defensive teams.  Rudy Gobert or Jokic? Neither have a ring and neither are getting one this year so whats your point?  Both are young enough to still win multiple.    Marcus Smart or Kyrie Irving?  Lebron got Kyrie his ring.  Lebron is first defensive team player.  Ben Simmons or Devon Booker?  Neither have a ring, but Simmons is more likely to get his this year than Booker is.  Tony Allen or Allen Iverson?  AI never got a ring.  Ben Simmons or Luka?  Neither have a ring, but Ben is in a better position to get his this year than Luka is.  Michael Cooper or Magic?  Magic and he was first defensive team... dafaq you smoking on this one nephew?  Bruce Bowen or Steve Nash?  Nash - no ring.  Dennis Rodman or Charles Barkley? No rings vs 2.  Ben Wallace or Dirk?  Obviously dirk, but why this comparison?  Dirk wasn't a Center."
Rudy Gobert. Then he flops on the bench.
"While they are at it, they can sign the other European players as well  Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Jokic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert, Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dennis Schroeder"
It’s gone.  I don’t know what to tell you.  We’re giving Rudy Gobert 3 DPOYs back to back for setting screens and looking intimidating on hedges at this point.  He literally stops no one who takes it to him.   Not a new event.  KG wasn’t a clamp either.  Dirk and Duncan ripped him apart but he growled so much when he blocked little dudes he gave himself a defensive rep.
"Yeah I was trying to figure out who would be #5 and if it's not Rudy then Ben's a good shout.   Definitely a better fit too.   I was thinking maybe Jamal Murray too but it depends on what OP wants. The best 5-man team or the best 5 players regardless of position.   If you're going best 5-man team: Murray, Luka, Simmons, Giannis, Embiid/Jokic.  If you're going best 5 players: Embiid, Giannis, Luka, Jokic, Gobert."
Rudy Gobert created COVID in a lab and released it on the world. Prove me wrong.
Imagine if Andre Drummond accepted a role playing like Clint Capela or Rudy Gobert instead of a wanna be Al Jefferson
Rudy Gobert and the screen assist
"Offensively it’s not really a fair comparison imo. Bam averaged 18.5 shots per 100 possessions this season, which is less than Herro, Butler, Dragic, and Nunn. Embiid averaged over 27, AD averaged over 25. So I don’t think he is used as a big enough part of Miami’s offense to expect him to be leading the way in that department.   It doesn’t help that the 1 on 1 matchup is tough. Brook Lopez is a really good post defender and the Heat can’t seem to find a way to exploit his pick and roll defense. He’s just dropping super deep, staying in the paint, and it’s working out because I don’t think they want Bam taking a ton of those mid range shots. You could say he’s at fault for that and should just be a better shooter, but imo it’s more on the coach to make adjustments in situations like that. If you’re not going to go all in and give Bam the green light on the pick and pop, you’ve gotta start doing something else.   Defensively, he makes some dumb plays occasionally but idk what to tell you if you think the Bucks scoring 130 was on him. They didn’t even score 50 of that 130 in the paint, and they only got to the line 20 times. He’s a really good defender, but one man can only do so much unless his name is Rudy Gobert.   Another reason Bam doesn’t catch as much criticism is that he’s on the definite underdog. I don’t think what happened last year is all that relevant, it’s been clear who the better team is this season. When you’re expected to win, a bad game is a much bigger deal than when you’re expected to lose. AD and Embiid also had hella hype coming into the league, and nobody expected much of Bam."
"There’s a reason Rudy Gobert just got a $205 million contract, lol"
"while he's not Rudy Gobert, you can hardly completely blame Nurk only for Blazers giving up 128 points. if anything, Nuggs went on a tear against the Melo/Kanter duo.  defense is very much a team game, especially against players like Jok who put a lot of emphasis on ball movement."
&gt; it’s so weird how people hate gobert  i dont even hate Rudy but how delusional do you have to be to not understand why people dislike him lol
"Giannis is WAY more valuable than Gobert on offense, even in a similar role. Rudy has bad hands and is nowhere near as dynamic on offense, he’s serviceable on that end while Giannis is dominant   He’s not gonna quite as good on defense, Rudy is amazing, but there’s a stark difference on the other end"
"Woah woah woah pump the brakes. FOH with ""glorified Rudy Gobert."""
"This, they need to let Giannis play to his strengths which is just being a glorified Rudy Gobert. Let players like Jrue and Middleton run the offense"
"Goran Dragic, Luka Doncic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic   Dennis Schroeder, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Davis Bertans, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert  Ricky Rubio, Evan Fournier, Danilo Gallinari, Domantas Sabonis, Nikola Vucevic (this squad could almost be all big men)  # EURO SQUAD, ASSEMBLE"
"When he's watching games, I wonder if Rudy Gobert randomly walks into his TV and pratfalls, just to keep his flop game sharp on off days."
"Someone (not a Mavs fan) tried to tell me KP was better for Rudy Gobert. Both in general as a player, as well as for the Mavs. Lmao"
Rudy “Trae “that’s not basketball” Young” Gobert
"I have ESPN on almost every morning before work, and they’ve done a pretty good job on roasting people for it over the last year. For instance, they were playing the Rudy Gobert clip this morning while she was eating breakfast and watching."
Do you even watch basketball? Rudy Gobert literally is one of the best perimeter pick and roll defenders in the league. Guards shoot way below avg when he’s guarding them on the perimeter.
"Tries so hard to earn the approval of his brother, Charles Gobert, but Chuck still only sees him as Slipping Rudy."
Clippers and Jazz were a lot better than the Celtics and Pistons...  &gt;Oh that’s right this is r/nba so rationality doesn’t exist and hot takes are the norm   It’s honestly hilarious how you’re comparing Jokic dominating against Rudy Gobert and Dwight/AD to Giannis dominating against Al Horford and Andre Drummond.
Rudy Gobert is an underrated flopper
"Do you just look at numbers or watch basketball lol? Stop talking down on everyone like you know better than everyone. Gobert has better impact numbers sure, but they need Donovan just as bad as they need Rudy in the playoffs. These games are often close and comes down to who can get the bucket in big situations and take advantage of mismatches. Rudy cannot do that while Donovan can and does. He can also break down defenses and create easier shots for Bogi, Conley, Ingles, etc. They're 1A and 1B in terms of importance for a Jazz team that has championship aspirations."
"It just hasn't seemed like the cleanest relationship at all with him and the organization.  Between the fanbase with the racial stuff, the Rudy Gobert stuff last year, and this, I don't know that they'd be able to come back from losing in the first round with the best record in the league and not letting him play it out.  At that point we're talking about a rocky relationship with Rudy *and* with the organization."
"I'm only slightly exaggerating.  I know they put it back together after the Rudy Gobert thing, but losing in the first round here would be pretty catastrophic."
"Basically my point. As good as Portland was last night, your offensive rating with Dame on the court was 131. With being one made 3 from a franchise record, while shooting 50% during the competitive portion of the game. With Jamal on the court for 7 games vs Utah last year Denver’s offensive rating was 138 with Rudy Gobert backstopping Utah’s defence."
Jazz Staff: Donovan Mitchell will not be playing tonights game  Rudy Gobert: i sleep
This was so shocking it made Rudy Gobert fall to the floor
"Jonas ""Rudy Gobert"" Valanciunas"
Are any centres good vs elite pick and role players? Rudy Gobert was hiding in the corner on Paul Millsap because he couldn’t contain the Jokic/Jamal pick and role last playoffs.
"Gobert usually has one of if not the best defensive ratings when switching onto the perimeter - https://www.forbes.com/sites/bendowsett/2020/06/29/rudy-goberts-improved-perimeter-defense-is-an-major-tool-for-the-utah-jazz/  Gobert doesn't look as smooth out there, and Ayton passes the eye test much better, I'll agree with that.  But Gobert's length and his recovery step (if he gets blown by) make him almost deceptively elite on switches."
"This take is getting old and boring. Rudy Gobert struggles vs elite pick and role players and Dame is near the best. Gobert was hiding on Paul Millsap in the corner like Trea Young by game 5 of the Nuggets series because he was incapable of containing the Jamal/Jokic pick and role. Almost every traditional centre struggles in the pick and role vs elite pick and role players.   According to synergy which has the video data of every pick and role every big has guarded all year Jokic grades out in the 71st percentile, and Nuggets as a whole were the 7th best in the league at defending such plays along with the 11 best defence overall.   https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/nikola-jokic-nba-mvp-odds-analysis-matt-moore-2021  The Nuggets defence was bad all around game 1. Blown rotations when they brought a 3rd guy. Guards died on every screen. And, Portland shot the lights out and were crisp with their passing. They shot 50% during the competitive portion of the game from 3, and were 1 made 3 from a franchise record.   Portland will get buckets, but a little cooler shooting, and better defence will help."
"I think he’s better than Rudy as well. He may not be as polished or locked in defensively as Rudy. But  when he is, I’ve frankly seen him do things Rudy can not. Not only did ayton do a good job guarding jokic ( much better than Goberts done) he was also able to switch onto Jamal on the perimeter and was giving him nothing.  Gobert frankly isn’t capable of that."
"Hey man I get that acting like an adult on the internet can be hard sometimes when you're only 12 but jesus christ, dude... I'm a diehard jazz fan and I was rolling my eyes hard at Rudy on that shit. It was bush league and made him look fucking dumb as hell. I absolutely love Rudy Gobert but it's not a stretch to say he does some dumb shit sometimes"
"The answer is easily, absolutely easily, Rudy Gobert. He is a one-man ELITE defense."
"&gt; So far this season, Ayton has flourished playing a two-way game that reaches rarified territory among All-Star big men. Ayton is one of eight centers producing +0.71 points of offensive impact and +0.50 points of defensive impact per 100 possessions, according to B-Ball Index; he and the Heat’s Bam Adebayo are the only other centers younger than 25 matching these marks. Per B-Ball Index, Ayton is first in the matchup difficulty metric (players he guards are high impact, high usage offensive options that other bigs don’t take on) among 37 centers who played 1,000 minutes this season. In addition, Ayton and Rudy Gobert of the Jazz are the NBA leaders in screen assists per 100 possessions and roll man impact per 100 possessions.  &gt; “I want to be certified as the best young two-way center who’s ever played the game,” Ayton told The Athletic. “I definitely see myself as being that player, but better. Being the guy that’s known for that, and not just capable of that. Defense is so important to my play style and that’s what creates my offense and that’s what helps my team score. Defense wins games — and that’s what I want to be known for when I’m done with this thing."

"Rudy Gobert and Bogdanovic had interesting quotes postgame about Mitchell being out  &gt; [When he woke up from his afternoon nap, Rudy Gobert was surprised to hear that Donovan Mitchell had been ruled out. Gobert: ""I try to stay out of all of this, because it’s just going to give me a headache. Hopefully, he’s good for next game. That’s all I’m worried about.""](https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1396688754492940289)    &gt; [Bojan Bogdanovic, on Donovan Mitchell: ""Of course we missed him, especially in the playoffs.

"Diehard Nuggs fan here, but to you Grizz fans, may I please jump on the wagon now unless we face each other?  The Grizz might be this year’s Nuggets where they gain a lot of support through their playoff run from fans of other teams. They have a ton of likable players and a young/“upstart” coach, and a smart FO, like the Nuggs too.  Plus it’s fun to root against the Jazz, let’s be honest. Quinn Snyder is a solid coach but he’s got a very annoying look and demeanor. Rudy Gobert is very easy to dislike, and while Spider is a total badass, that team and organization has just always been easy to root against unless you’re a straight up Jazz fan. They’re never really gonna pull fans like The Nuggs or Grizz seem to be doing. Yes, I’m biased as a Nuggs fan, but am I wrong?!"
"Unless Rudy Gobert disappears overnight and Mitchell doesn’t come back from his injury, I think the jazz are still favoured to win. Great game from Memphis though"

Rudy Gobert fleeced the Jazz for $200million SMH. Shaq was right he is soft as hell just like ADisney

"Eh, a 3 point loss where Donovan’s out and Rudy only plays 25 minutes isn’t bad, especially when we shoot awfully from 3. Basically everything that could go wrong did and it was pretty close.  But Quinn has got to stop sitting Gobert for 5 minutes twice in the first half. It worked great in the regular season to keep him fresh but we’re terrible when Rudy’s not out there (-12 tonight) and that’s gonna kill us at some point. We hadn’t played in 6 days and don’t play again for another 3. Get that bud shit outta here."
LMAO $200million man Rudy Gobert 11 points and 6 fouls YIKES

What the actual fuck is Rudy Gobert doing
FUCK RUDY GOBERT
Rudy Gobert DPOTY baby
Do the refs have the stones to give the meal ticket of the league Rudy Gobert a sixth foul? Does anybody even watch the playoffs if Rudy Gobert isn't there?
BYE BYE RUDY GOBERT  UTAH FANS MAD UTAH FANS MAD
Rudy Gobert is French for round one exit.
Prepare the Rudy Gobert slander.
What I wanna know is how Rudy Gobert got tanner in Utah
Rudy Gobert went to LeBron's Acting School during the offseason I see.
All-NBA Rudy Gobert came to play in the absence of Mitchell  5 points on 2/2 from the field 🔥🔥
"""Total blocks leader"" Rudy Gobert. Can't believe Reggie taking shots at a Pacer like that."
Love to talk a out shooting range to defend Rudy Gobert. It shows I definitely know ball
"Rudy Gobert has had a great career, super consistent every year!"
He's going to keep taking it to Gobert all series and it'll be great - Gobert wil stop him most times but he'll get a dunk on him once and all the casuals will call Rudy trash.
Probably downvoting me for suggesting that Rudy Gobert is DPOY over Ben Simmons.
Imagine watching Rudy Gobert play defense and ever thinking about voting for someone other than him like Ben Simmons for DPOY.  Rudy should be the winner every year until he stops being a one man defense.
"Here's the deal, Donovan Mitchell gets the sportscenter highlights and all the cool shots. But the real MVP of this team is Rudy gobert. When he is on the floor, the opposing offense has to adjust majorly in his presence. He is the best player on this team"
"I love to be a competent NBA GM and give 200 million dollars to Rudy Gobert, a player who can’t play in the playoffs"
“What the hell is Rudy Gobert wearing” lmfao
"Rudy Gobert signed that contract before he got his defensive player of the year awards. Ayton isn't a top 4 or 5 center now like Gobert is but in a couple years, Ayton is one of the top contenders for being a top center in the league."
"Lmao, right?  Easy.  He's not in a position to get Rudy Gobert money yet, so it's not even a controversial idea."
Because he hasn't demonstrated that ability? Rudy Gobert is a generational defensive player (at least in the regular season). Ayton hasn't demonstrated anything close to that.
Rudy Gobert is a better overall player than AD as well.
Rudy Gobert would get abused by the Nets. Frankly I dont want to see Utah in the finals against them because of just how much the Nets would expose Gobert.
"Nikola Jokic   Joel Embiid   Rudy Gobert   KAT   Clint Capela   Nikola Vucevic   Bam Adebayo   Myles Turner    I think he’s around top 10, I guess depending on how you classify some guys like AD, Wood, etc.  Are there any obvious centers I’m missing who you rate over Nurk?"
"Damn, Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert are looking kinda weird."
Would kill have to Rudy Gobert as his number 2. The one man offense and the one man defense
Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons aren't playing
&gt;The only possible one I see happening this season is Rudy Gobert getting 11 blocks.   Westbrook had 24 assists like two weeks ago.
The only possible one I see happening this season is Rudy Gobert getting 11 blocks. I think he had 9 one game this season
Rudy Gobert legitimately belongs in that conversation as well. He is easily the most underrated player in the league.
"Obviously I'd love to finally see Phila win a chmapionship this year but as long as the Lakers and Nets don't win this year I'll be okay with the result.     Also: Maybe add Utah to that list as well because fuck Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, but the rest of the team ain't so cool as well."
"The Grizzlies are a terrible 3pt shooting team, they score their points in the paint. And Rudy Gobert is the best paint defender on Earth."
"Grizzlies could have the most difficult finals run of all time, having to go through Steph Curry, Donovan Mitchell + Rudy Gobert, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Lebron James and Anthony Davis, to meet up against potentially James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  The West is fucking nuts."
Yeah because that precedent that was set by Rudy Gobert not following protocol and getting sued for getting Donovan Mitchell sick. Sure buddy
Grizzlies are like the #1 paint offense by % of shots and the Jazz have Rudy Gobert. That's a super good matchup for them.
For some reason people hate the Jazz and Rudy Gobert. I guess they are the babyfaces that get booed.
He'll just play it off like he motivated Gobert to elevate his game. In his mind he'll want a ring for all the work he's put in on Rudy and Donovan this season.
I can’t believe there’s people here honestly saying fucking Chris Paul isn’t better than Rudy Gobert. r/nba is so dumb  I’m not saying he should be above him on the MVP standings but people saying that Rudy is a better player is what irks me
Positionless All-NBA teams make no sense. Either stick to the team concept or do a 15-player MVP ballot.   &gt;	but a forward on 1st team All-Defense so Rudy could be on 1st team too.  ?   If someone makes Embiid a forward it’s to move him up from the second to the first team. Gobert has 1st team center position locked.
Rudy Gobert is a good Hand
Just like any other singular plural.  I saw a deer. I saw three deer.  Jameer Nelson was a Magic.  Rudy Gobert is a Jazz.

"Rudy ""Bran"" Gobert"
Yeah I'd say it's this and I know we say this on reddit all the time but it isn't really all that close. I will say that in the playoffs so far in their careers Donovan has elevated his game quite a bit at times and in those moments he gets pretty damn close to Gobert or maybe even better. If he could sustain that level all the time he'd be better than Rudy but he'd also be a legit MVP candidate.
Donovan Mitchell is the best player on that Utah team in terms of offense. Obviously it's difficult to be better than rudy gobert defensively but without mitchell this team simply does not click into place. He is the best player on the jazz team 100%
"I find there's a lot of focus on this sub and elsewhere about the things players can't do. Like, Rudy Gobert couldn't guard 2010 Derrick Rose 1 on 1. Well guess what, nobody can do *everything*. LeBron may have come closest, but he's a top 2 player of all time.   Let's appreciate Kawhi for what he does well, which is a whole lot of things"
 &gt;He torched Rudy Gobert who is arguably one of the greatest defenders ever.  When did Portland get Rudy?
"Neither of these teams look like champion teams. Mavericks too reliant on Luka, and the clippers are weak minded and too streaky.  If any team in the west comes out, it’ll be the Jazz. Winner of bucks/nets wins title. I hope.  If the NBA sees Rudy Gobert hoisting the Larry O’Brien you will find Silvers dead body floating in freshwater somewhere."
Porzingis is just dreadful man. Rudy Gobert is gonna absolutely abuse him.
He's no Rudy Gobert.
how mavericks feel when other people have the ball while luka doncic is in the game begging for the ball  thats how jazz fans feel when rudy gobert is resting on the bench
"This year really does feel like the changing of the guard in the NBA a little bit, if the Mavs close this out the remaining 8 teams will be led by their stars of:  Donovan Mitchell/Rudy Gobert (never made Finals)  Devin Booker/CP3 (never made Finals)  Nikola Jokic (never made Finals)  Luka Doncic (never made Finals)  Joel Embiid/Ben Simmons (never made Finals)  Giannis (never made Finals)  Trae Young (never made Finals)  and then KD who has won Finals/Harden who's never been  Other than the Nets it's allll fresh blood from a superstars perspective. And same from an organization perspective for the most part. Exciting times!"
Just gonna shitpost about Rudy Gobert instead tonight I guess. Maybe throw in a few Luka vs Traes.
"Who's beating the All-Cancer team.  PG: Dame Lillard SG: Brad Beal SF: Kawhi Leonard PF: Zion Williamson C: Rudy Gobert   With a bench of: Ben Simmons, SGA, Tobias Harris, MPJ, Steven Adams, Bam Adebayo"
Rudy Gobert because I love defense.
Rudy Gobert 💯
Rudy 'Patient Zero' Gobert is a much more badass nickname
"Now that the Lakers are gone, it the Nets lose I won’t watch this year only out of spite to make sure Rudy Gobert was wrong with his statement.  This is my new life goal."
**Kobe vs Wade** - Kobe  **Duncan vs  Garnett** - Tim Duncan  **Dirk vs  Robinson** - Dirk Nowitizi  Some of my own:   **James Harden vs Kevin Durant**  **Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker vs Bradley Beal**  **Rudy Gobert vs KAT**  **Jimmy Butler vs Kyrie Irving**
You guys were draws because you had a clear cut superstar on the team who won the MVP and his personal brand of basketball that was unprecedented at the time. We're talking about a top 15 all-time player in his prime here. You can't expect the same excitement about Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell.
"Imagine Game of Zones is still on, and Sixers won the title despite Embiid's injury.  Rudy Gobert, AKA The Stifle Tower, as a dwarf, crowning Embiid, sitting on his wheelchair."
Rudy Gobert deserved to be a candidate. Fight me
"Thank you, Rudy ‘Tyrion Lannister’ Gobert."
"It’s hard to imagine him as more than a Rudy Gobert type player given how limited he was on offence. Even though players eat and train better now, I can still see KAJ dominating today for example"
"Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell.  Anthony Bennett (out of the league), Victor Oladipo (derailed by injuries), Giannis Antetokounmpo (2x MVP and a DPOY), Rudy Gobert (DPOY).  Stephen Curry (still playing at an elite level) and Blake Griffin (now a role player/situational starter). And Curry's older as well."
Rudy Gobert. I'm still upset at him intentionally spreading covid.
Rudy Gobert is gonna get taken off the floor. Kyrie and harden are legit gonna do dance moves around him
"I would also give them credit for drafting Donovan Mitchel, Rudy Gobert and Nurkic. Even though they gave up on them those were all excellent draft picks"
"Like 3 NBA players have spoken in support of the people of Palestine being removed from their homes and being killed by the Israeli government, but are you holding that against them for staying silent. Silence is violence right. Or is this just circumstantial for you? Don’t use people’s real life deaths to make yourself better for not like a player if you won’t hold that same energy for all the players. Your best player literally treated the pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people like a joke. But o don’t you’re GP Rudy Gobert every night."
"I mean, fuck Rudy Gobert. But Mike Conley love is greater. Hope they win."
ironic considering rudy gobert forced the lockdown
"Remember when Rudy Gobert rubbed a microphone as a slap in the face to everyone who took covid seriously, simply because he thought covid was a hoax?..  Donovan Mitchell remembers."
"You talk about potential as if most of these guys aren't already better than Tatum. Tatum's slight uptick in passing efficiency hasn't even gotten him close to any of the guys I've mentioned in terms of passing/playmaking. In terms of scoring Tatum is great and up there with the guys I mentioned, but he isn't going to become a better passer in the next 5 years than any of these guys are now unless CP3 possesses him. Doncic has plateaud statwise, but his game has shown improvement with the introduction of the midrange and post game making him an even more robust scorer come playoffs. Where has Tatum shown that type of growth in his playmaking? Tatum is about the same level as Paul George as a number 1 option right now in their careers, but PG has shown a higher peak being an MVP candidate in OKC.   Clearly you rate Tatum very high, but you're comparing him with players of similar age who are already Top 15 or even Top 5 in case of Jokic and Giannis. He would have to show something that he has never done to even become better than Luka is now by learning how to pass/playmake at an elite level. Idk how you can say other young guards in the league outside of Luka have shown the same ceiling as Young when he is already putting up monstrous scoring and assist stats whilst being the sole focus of the defence. I'm not gonna bother arguing with you if you think Tatum has the potential to become a top 10 passer in the league or that he has the potential defensive impact of a Rudy Gobert or Draymond Green. Because those are the only ways he even comes close Jokic, Giannis, Luka or leapfrogs Young and Zion in terms of potential value. He's a great player and a perennial all-star/all-nba, but he isn't a future MVP candidate unless he does something he hasn't even shown glimpses of."
"... Yeah?   Are you under the assumption that I’m dissing Rudy?  In terms of their roles on a team, Gobert and Russell would both be defensive specialist big men who aren’t the main focal point of a teams offense but can anchor a teams defense."
Bill Russell would be the black Rudy Gobert
Rudy gobert is your new king.
Bro I'm saying. He was projected to be a project center in the mold of Clint Capela or Rudy Gobert with the future of a jump shot. I honestly don't know what a lot of people were expecting out of him. Especially considering he's been backing up Vuc.
That Rudy Gobert is a fraud
lol no. just because you are such a bad coach that you cant adjust for simmons at the center doesnt mean that simmons is all of a sudden great  Any answer that isnt rudy gobert or bred yogurt or any other fucking combination of the actual dpoy this year is asinine and foolish

"&gt;What did the clippers do to Luka!?  Almost nothing.  They are inexplicably making his life as easy as possible.  Other than sending him an engraved invitation to do whatever he pleases, I cannot imagine how they could go easier on him.  The steadfastly refuse to make him work, or even run, at all, for no imaginable reason.  They avoid him on defense like they think he's Rudy Gobert.  They let him play as slowly and casually as he likes, which is a recipe for getting torched.  On many possessions, they didn't even bother to guard him.  Either Lue is completely useless as a coach, or Cuban is holding his family hostage and the ransom is throwing this series."
"I think without rudy you are a lottery team. Rudy raises your floor way too much. Basically you can say we are gonna handle defense, imma surround you with offensive disciplined players that can sorta play defense and we are gonna be one of the best defenses in league. Gobert is too underrated."
Rudy is our floor. Donovan is our ceiling.  Rudy ensures that we competitive against anyone with solid defense and enabling the offensive system we run.  When Donovan is playing at his peak alongside Gobert we’re basically unstoppable.
"Rudy ""19/18 while holding the opponents to 80 points in a game 7 but somehow blamed"" Gobert"
"I need another hit bro, tell me he was holding back Oladipo all along. Tell me Myles will start becoming the next Rudy Gobert asap"
Because people care more about individual players in basketball.    KD made OKC a household name because of his playstyle.  What are you going to do to market Rudy Gobert on that level?
Rudy Gobert.
Why do people think this lol. this has never been an issue. Gobert wasn't able to propel the Jazz over three of the best offensive teams ever as a young player with a bunch of mismatched parts. People are so dumb if they think Rudy is unplayable against small lineups.
I’d like an apology from everyone that told me that Rudy Gobert is unusable in the playoffs.
Rudy Gobert might die
"Someone who can improve the Mavs interior defense and can shot block. Also, catch lobs. So Rudy Gobert but he will never leave Utah for Dallas, as Utah is better rn. Myles Turner is another shout. I doubt any team will be happy to take KP's bad contract."
Rudy Gobert
"Rudy ""Irving"" Gobert"
"Rudy Gobert won two DPOY awards and will win his third this year once it’s announced. Him, Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley all made the all-star team this year. Jordan Clarkson won 6th man of the year this year. Gobert and Mitchell are legit top tier players and now have multiple all star appearances. Mitchell has even won the dunk contest. Conley has been a great player for many years, but was always just barely pushed out of making the all star team. There are also some high level role players on the Jazz such as Bogdanovic and Ingles. In short, they have two (less famous due to small market) stars in Mitchell and Gobert matched with a deep roster filled great role players. I’m not exactly sure where I’d rank the two stars, but Gobert is probably the absolute best defensive presence in the league and Mitchell is a top 15 scorer."
"They have a bunch of pretty good players. Rudy Gobert is going to lock up his third defensive player of the year this year, and Donovan Mitchell has been a very good scorer, he might have a top 10 ceiling. Beyond them, Mike Conley was a pretty good point guard for Memphis forever, and he's... still pretty good this year. Bojan is a good scorer too, and their last starter, Royce O'Neal, is a great three and d guy. Off the bench includes Clarkson and Ingles, who were top two in the six man of the year voting.  Basically, they all gel together super well, and are really deep. Their shooting and ball movement is tremendous, and Gobert locks down the paint."
"Combination of a few things: underrated young stars like Donovan Mitchell, defensive focused players like Rudy Gobert who are never as popular in the media (despite winning multiple defensive player of the year awards), as well as what you said about really meshing together well. A lot of times the star loaded teams don’t “try” as much during the regular season or end up being injured a good amount of time, like how the nets big 3 who only played 7 games together all regular season, or lebron who infamously takes it slower during the regular season."
"Little bit of both I’d say. Their best players are Rudy gobert and Donovan Mitchell, who are both all starts but more in the top 15-20 range. Their supporting cast is also excellent, they have the 6moy Jordan Clarkson as well as mike Conley, a borderline all star player"
"Donovan Mitchell is only in his fourth season. Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley don't get the respect they deserve from the national media. I'm surprised you haven't heard of Donovan yet, he's a superstar.  That said, the strength of our team is our team, it's our chemistry that makes us this good"
"Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley and Rudy gobert aren't a bunch of nobodies"
He literally said Donovan Mitchell would never be a superstar to his face and acted like he was trying to motivate him by saying that. He constantly downplays centers for not playing the way a traditional center would. He picks on Rudy Gobert for having a large contract not understanding how important he is to that team. I agree a lot of analysts are pretty bland but that doesn't make Shaq's takes not awful.
Capella is Rudy gobert east
Rudy Gobert. For Jokic - Gobert lobs and defense.
Do the Hawks have Clint Capela or Rudy Gobert down there the Knicks haven’t been able to score anything in the paint
Rudy Gobert is irrelevant against a team with four lethal three point shooters and Mike Conley can’t hang with Kyrie or Harden.  It’s not about defending your p&amp;r. It’s about you not being able to score 140 or stop us from scoring 140.
"Needs to play against ""not DPOY"" Rudy Gobert."
"To put this into context. Rudy Gobert only scored 1 point in the first half of the last game against the Grizzlies. When the second half started Gobert scored 10 points in 5 minutes.  Rudy Gobert, in five minutes, scored as many points as the entire Lakers squad did in an entire quarter."
"Not unless they can get a defensive center on the level of Rudy Gobert, that defence would be atrocious"
"at the jazz game 2 fans were chanting MVP for mitchell, and I was too  but then rudy gobert shot free throws and it was me and like 10 other people chanting MVP  i was like ;("
Romeo “Rudy Gobert” Langford
never since rudy gobert is making Max too
"Nah, I’m with it EVERY TIME there’s a Rudy Gobert lowlight"
"Why do you think the Grizzlies are down 3-1 to the jazz all while Ja still continues to play a very high level lmaoo yeah the jazz dont have an answer for Ja but you know whats being taken away? JV and his interior  presence all because of Rudy Gobert lol give the Grizzlies any other first round matchup and I guarantee you its JV that leads them. Notice how Ja is doing everything he can but still can’t seem to win?! Its almost like the Jazz aren’t real #1 seed and aren’t taking away the most lethal part about the Grizzlies offense, which is JVs interior presence with offensive rebounds and such that are being taken away by Gobert"
"What he did to KAT was impressive, but what he did to Rudy Gobert was just insane. Demolished him on offense and defense(not just Gobert himself, but basically everyone on the Jazz who tried to get to the rim."
Heres an interesting question for you then;  Rudy Gobert. Supermax player or no? His PPG since 2016 has been 14.5. Which is less than Simmons.
"Draymond would be an upgrade if we could just slot him in without losing anyone but any time you trade two critical rotation players for an upgrade in the starting roster you might be in some trouble. If we had Draymond instead of Ingles and Clarkson we'd have never kept the 1st seed when Mitchell went down and st best we'd be the 2 seed facing the Lakers right now. With Bogey and Faves it would be even worse, we've seen what happens when Rudy sits and we don't have a strong defensive center as his backup. Even with Favs our bench gets roasted when Gobert sits."
What?   Rudy Gobert is 240 was my reference I don’t know what you are on about   He currently can’t switch onto most 5s he would need to add strength as I said....?
Lol stop playing 2k bro. Just because he can defend Rudy fucking Gobert doesn't mean he can guard the 5. Literally any of the top centers in this league would destroy him. Just because he can reasonably switch 1 to 5 doesn't mean you can stick him on AD or Jokic or even Vucevic for that matter.
What?   Why would he need to bulk up   He’s 240   Does Rudy Gobert need to bulk up?   He’s defensively skilled enough that he doesn’t need mass   He might need more strength tho but his skill as a switcher at the 5 would be menacing
"no, my arguments chalk up to bad defensive stats don't matter.  draymond is 5th in terms of epm defense, \~10th in terms of d-raptor and d-lebron, which is all v. good. sure, its not top 3, but advanced stats also are not gospel especially in a 72 game sample where noise isn't trivial (most analytics folk prefer multi-year metrics while gauging player value, because context/noise complicate your information, where i'm sure draymond outdoes most others). for instance, claxton has a higher defensive value by all the metrics, though his d-value is somewhat inflated by playing on a not great defensively nets team. in general, too, defensive metrics aren't as good as offensive ones so they need to be taken with a grain of salt.  plus, you can add on, that draymond's defense is more resilient than gobert/others -- it's easier to scheme for gobert and hunt a switch onto him/start isolating than it is to deal with draymond. that's not to say that rudy isn't a great postseason defender either, but draymond's defense goes up another notch there. having said all that, i still think that gobert should win dpoy, but draymond's metrics are all slightly better than simmons who is a consensus dpoy candidate, as he should be.  steals/blocks don't come close to evaluating defensive impact, defensive rebounds are even worse of a measurement, and defensive Win Shares pretty much only measures d-rating when a player is on the floor, which is as rudimentary as it goes. there's so much else which doesn't show up in the statsheet."
&gt; Ben Simmons is basically just a worse Rudy Gobert  Then don't make dumbass comparisons like this 💀
"Exactly. I was honestly surprised they hadn't been attacking him as much as they maybe should. Easiest way to negate Gobert is to get him into foul trouble. Especially a team like Memphis that gets into the paint a lot.  On the flip side though JV is also getting cooked in the exact same PnR coverages. He's getting caught in the middle and is basically screwed no matter what he does. If he tries to contest Conley, he gives up a lob to Rudy. If he sticks to Rudy, Conley just tosses in a floater.  If the help collapses, Utah kicks it out and swings for their 800th three pointer.  I think it just ends up being too much for Memphis to cover. The margin for error is just extremely small against a team like Utah."
"As of right now, Ben Simmons is basically just a worse Rudy Gobert. Worse offensive production, slightly less great defensive production"
"But my point was that if you aren't going to be an elite rim protector like Rudy Gobert, you have to play as many playoff games as LeBron. You pointed this out as well, but my previous point was that if you get a point center who's an elite rim protector, he doesn't \*have\* to do that. If Jokic could average 2 blocks per game in the playoffs like Rudy Gobert, he'd be in an incredible place even without 10 finals appearances."
Rudy Gobert is one of the longest players the league has ever seen
"They also could have mentioned how Ben Simmons' DPOY rival Rudy Gobert, a career 62% FT shooter, was still capable of maintaining enough focus in the closing moments of the Jazz/Grizzlies game, when it counted, and calmly knock down 2 free throws helping to seal the win."
"Is Steph the only player that largely escapes criticism?    Anyway, I see Simmons and Rudy Gobert as similar—anyone who watches these games know how crucial these players are, but they get a ton of hate because they’re just not great at scoring"
Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert
Rudy “Rob Schneider” Gobert
Rudy “Val Venis” Gobert
This is like the ultimate Rudy Gobert sentence
"I'd take Rudy and Donovan over Paul George every day of the week. PG isn't higher impact than Gobert, sorry."
Now they’re telling me it’s Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert on offense looks like he’s being guarded by Rudy Gobert
"Just 4-5 years ago this team would've killed  C: Rudy Gobert / DeAndre Jordan / Clint Capella / Jusuf Nurkic  PF: Kevin Love / Serge Ibaka / Zach Randolph  SF: Jae Crowder / Tim Hardaway Jr. / Khris Middleton  SG: Klay Thompson / Buddy Hield / Gary Harris  PG: Jrue Holiday / Tony Parker  Love, Holiday, Klay and Gobert were all all star level players in '16-18"
"yeah i was merely talking about the numbers that both you and the other user were discussing because i thought they were pretty impressive, especially against Rudy Gobert. unlike OP i don't believe he's the best finisher in the paint among guards but he's probably not too far off"
A Rudy Gobert Tech is a +10 to all teammates
Fuck Rudy Gobert man
Anyone who sits at the end chair has to flame Rudy gobert
Through a baguette at Rudy gobert
"Rudy Gobert, among others"
is that Gafford or Rudy Gobert?
"Honestly once I suggested it I decided it needed to happen, only in reverse. If Ja posters Gobert, Gobert pays 100k, but Ja pays 10k for every time Rudy blocks him."
"Well it depends on how you define best. I’d say you have it backwards - he functions in most schemes, but there are a few specific schemes where he does not.   A lot of this falls on Snyder for doing absolutely nothing to put Rudy in a situation where he can succeed. Lue set Gobert up to fail (like a good coach does) and Snyder just let him.   At the same time, something was off these past 4 games. Rudy was timid and soft and choosing to not contest guards driving to the rim. He’s not injured, so I don’t have a clue what it was. I’ve never seen anything like it."
Okay Gobert didn't give it to him. Sorry.  But they did have some kind of discord last year:  https://www-espn-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29406398/utah-jazz-stars-donovan-mitchell-rudy-gobert-rift-them?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;platform=amp&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#aoh=16241174636753&amp;csi=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fnba%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F29406398%2Futah-jazz-stars-donovan-mitchell-rudy-gobert-rift-them
rudy gobert trick y'all
"It’s like we didn’t just watch him ball out.   Clippers exposed Rudy Gobert much like Ben Simmons has done in the past, and we see how he performs in the playoffs.  Also as an opposing fan, that’s the level of respect I have for the guy, he is what he is."
Became Rudy Gobert daddy
The series ended for the Jazz when Mann dunked on Gobert in game 5.  Rudy lost all his confidence and the Clips were no longer afraid of him.
"Honestly it's come full circle for a guy like Rudy Gobert. He gets played off the court in small ball because he can't punish small ball lineups on offense. If he had any resemblance of a post game, he could punish guys like Batum in the post, either forcing a double and opening up the rest of the offense for Utah, or forcing the Clippers to play a center. But he went 5/6 for 12 points. His switchability on defense isn't as big of a factor as his lack of ability to punish smaller guys on the block."
Wait they are paying Rudy Gobert how much
"Boy the bloom is off the rose for Rudy. Biased take, Anthony Davis is a much better defensive player than Gobert"
I'm a Pacers fan and Rudy Gobert is absolutely better than Mules Turner. Delete this you homer.
"People need to stop framing it like this. The Jazz defensive strategy got exposed, not Rudy. Their strategy was to keep him on the floor against a 5 out offense, once one of the wing players gets blown by (which was happening every possession) then Gobert is on an island to help on the drive. It’s more Snyder/the Jazz as an organization at fault for not using or having the pieces to combat that."
"Every year, we do this exact same shit with Rudy Gobert. The Jazz lose the playoffs, partially due to the fact that Rudy Gobert got exposed.    r/NBA blows it up, acting like Gobert is worse than a minimum contract player. ""Worst contract in the league."" ""Not a 3x DPOY."" ""Trade him.""    And then when the regular season starts, people realize all over again how effective Rudy is."
"I don't do it for the internet points, I do it for the love of the game.   There were several times yesterday where fucking Reggie Jackson tried Rudy on floaters/layups right at the rim too, which you'd be certain Gobert would swat the fuck out of. My man who was arguing with me is probably down bad right now."
Rudy Gobert was the best defender all season
"All defense and 3rd team all NBA, what a joke.  All NBA needs to get rid of positions. Rudy Gobert is not in the top 15 players. He's barely in the top 50."
Loool How’s being a good a regular season team treating you? Teams just don’t care to game plan around Gobert during the regular season and then he gets exposed every playoffs and then every year yall expect it to be different. Imagine being a 3x dpoy played off the floor on defense.. draymond could never. Dmitch is clearly your best player and Rudy just happens to be 7 ft tall
Rudy Gobert=Ben Simmons
"I think that's as much about the other Jazz players' inability to stay in front of anyone than the scheme. They need to funnel everything to Rudy because that's the best that most of their other players can do. When you run into a team playing 5 out, that means Gobert has the impossible job of defending a shooter and covering up everyone else's mistakes."
Rudy Gobert trick y'all man
dpoy rudy gobert with the -24
"I mean its a combination of both Gobert being too rooted in the paint and his team mates offering free lanes to the rack to anyone who could dribble a fucking basketball.  The safety of having Gobert a rim protector has probably made the Jazz perimeter defenders far too complacent at giving up drives, seriously look at how easy it was for the Clippers to penetrate deep into the paint.  And the Jazz have no fucking clue how to rotate when Gobert has to step up to the perimeter &amp; close out on shooters. Gobert is now caught in 2 minds, does he close out on the shooter and vacate the paint where he is strongest? Or does he stay and hope the shooter misses?  Rudy Gobert having absolutely zero offensive moves to counter the Clippers playing 6'7/6'8 dudes at center is a bigger mark against him than his defense IMO. Ty Lue figured out he could just go small like D'Antoni did with the Rockets, since Gobert can't do shit to them offensively anyway."
"Gobert falls apart in the playoffs. It’s happened enough that’s it’s just a fact now. Teams easily play around him. Grizzlies would’ve taken them out in the first round if Mitchell wasn’t there.  People calling out the Jazz fo for that kind of contract for the skills he brings have been proven right. They’re never going to the finals with Rudy as the centerpiece, let alone win a championship."
"You're obviously right about the huge difference between Gobert and KP when it comes to rim protection. The thing about zone in general is that it makes it a lot harder to cover all the shooters than playing man.  In a sense Jazz often play a version of zone, in that Gobert fake-covers the worst (corner) shooter but is actually on the edge of the paint the whole time, and the other 4 guys aggressively cover a shooter each. This is really the basic tenet of Jazz defence -- Rudy covers the rim/paint on his own, the rest try to limit shooting."
Mavs personnel =\= Jazz. They didn’t have Rudy Gobert as a rim protector. I’d imagine the Jazz would be able to play a more active aggressive zone on the perimeter because Gobert is there to protect the rim and there’s no big man in the dunkers spot to worry about throwing a dump off pass too if he comes to help.
Rudy “DPOY” Gobert
You guys need to stop this.  Why is it ya'll cant except Gobert is a problem but can accept every other center is? Seriously. We literally see every big like Gobert played off the floor so what makes Gobert different?  Those 3s are his fault. The Clippers aren't afraid of his contest because they know he is too slow to get there. That's why they shot with so much confidence and made sure he was the one contesting. Just because you stop a drive doesn't mean your job is finished. Rudy has to be quick enough to rotate multiple times. He's not.
Rudy Gobert should give back his DPOY. Year after year voters fuck defensive voting up.
RuDy GoBeRt DeSeRvED DPOY
Back to back 40pt quarters from a Kawhi-less Clippers...Jazz got smoked by a dude only making his second playoff start in his career as a sophomore.  I don't wanna hear a damn thing about Rudy Gobert again.
Unless you're Rudy Gobert or Ben Simmons
Fuck Rudy.  Wiggins+Wiseman for Gobert?
DPOY Rudy Gobert
"this isnt the entire reason the jazz lost, but you just cant play gobert against good playoff teams with skilled guards/wings. he can be great in spurts and i think the jazz ignored him on offense at times when he was open in the paint which frustrated me but he needed to be taken out.     same thing will happen when the hawks face a team that can truly take advantage of trae switching onto them on defense. when it comes down to it, if you can be taken advantage of, you will be and its happened to rudy again."
Friendly reminder that Jazz legend Rudy Gobert shut the league down with COVID
Is Rudy Gobert going to get Roy Hibbert'd?
Lol where’s everyone that was calling Rudy Gobert a top 5 player now???
"You can't retort because you don't understand the game, you're a low iq casual. Firstly, you don't even know what an X out is until I explained it to you. Secondly, you're talking about Rudy not 'scrambling'. There's no scramble, Utah's game plan is to leave Terrence Mann in the corner because according to their scouting he's a bad shooter. They wanted Mann to beat them from the perimeter and he did. It literally had nothing to do with Gobert not 'scrambling fast enough'. It was basically a game of KYP, know your personnel, Ty Lue knew Mann could hit those shots because he watched him put in the reps the whole year and Quinn Snyder didn't."
No one respects Rudy Gobert. FTFY
Great thanks! I think synder is a great coach. Dude tbh they just dont have the personnel. Losing conley was a bummer too cos they couldnt unlock their offense and couldnt make Rudy dominate with the threat of the pick n roll cos of conleys absence. They didnt have a true pg out there. If conley was out there this wouldve gone 7 WITH a healthy kawhi. Also thanks for not being dumb like 90 percent of this sub. Been seeing gobert slander everywhere from casuals again. They literally can’t see how afraid/reluctant the clippers(teams) are in attacking the paint cos of Gobert.
It’s not about that. It’s about the Jazz’s defensive defencies beyond Gobert. The coaches know it the players know it heck even the announcers sometimes point it out. The Clippers dominate and can get to the paint easier with Favors out there. The jazz have sound defenders but they dont have lockdown one on one defenders apart from royce o neale. Their entire defense is designed for Rudy to man the paint and force the opposing team to scramble and get an open three point shot late in the shot clock. It went in most of the time bec the clippers are the best three point shooting team in percentage but that was one heck of a gamble (smart) by Ty Lue to go 5 out for almost the entire series. Maybe fans can get enjoyment from the nba when they are able to see what players and coaches do right more than what they think these professionals are doing wrong.
That's also on Rudy Gobert.
"&gt; Rudy would’ve been fine against pretty much any team except the Clippers.  I don't think so.  Any reasonably good team can play 5 out small ball and do the exact same thing.  Maybe they don't have a Mann that drop that many points but that's been a solution to Gobert for years, we saw it in those Houston series' as well."
"Don't ever say Rudy Gobert is the best player in Utah Jazz.  Also, Jazz is screwed at least for a few years unless Gobert develops post up based low post offensive skills."
That’s what happens when that person is Rudy Gobert 3 years in a row.
Man I woke up and took a steaming Rudy Gobert this morning
I find it hilarious that Patrick Beverley has 7 blocks in 134 mins meanwhile Rudy Gobert has 7 blocks in 256 mins
"They are swinging those doors closed; plus Rudy, Donovan, and Gobert will razzle and dazzle their way out of the big conversation"
Curing cancer? That’s Rudy Gobert. Morning wood? Also Gobert. That feeling you get in the back of your throat when you gotta cough but after trying to hold it in? Gobert.
"Even tho I am a clippers fan, I have nothing but respect for Rudy Gobert and Donovan mitchell. The man played his heart out. And when he slipped in last minute of the game it totally freaked me out. I hope he isn't hurt or something."
"Teardrop floaters, acrobatic layups, sneak layups he really gave Rudy gobert a bag lol.  You'd think Rudy was like 5'11 the way he was going right at him with. It was crazy.  Even Kawhi and PG didn't go at rudy like that. Same with mann at times hesitated. Reggie is like, nah fuck that. I'm just going in."
"If you still haven't gotten it, it's a hilarious way of saying Rudy Gobert.  It references Andrea Bargnani, a former Italian 7ft NBA player, famous for his lackadaisical defense. Brioche is a type of french bread."
"Lol they’re still hundred times more suited than Rudy, especially when they’re needed on offense. Gobert is a scrub on offense and he was never gonna make us pay for going small.   His limitations get masked in the regular season because teams are either not good enough or don’t have time/try to exploit him."
"I agree that's the issue for the most part, but I'm not entirely sure that the league is heading in that direction in such a dramatic way that we will see a ton of teams like this series' Clippers.  Ultimately there are few things better than a star big man, and even guys like Sabonis, Nurkic, Valanciunas, and Lopez could have really done some significant and consistent damage in the paint vs. that line up. Let alone guys like Jokic, Embiid, Vucevic, or KAT.   I think the problem can be alleviated in a couple different ways. One is Gobert just getting one singular post move. He can get into the key and call for the ball and get it any time he wants vs. Batum,  keep the ball high, and have some sort of drop step move or baby hook if we're being very optimistic. He's gotta have at least one thing he can go to.  Second is Mitchell needs to significantly improve his playmaking. Rudy gets involved on the offensive end so much more and much more easily with a healthy Conley on the floor setting up lobs, little dump offs, and short rolls for him. Mitchell has not been able to do that with any regularity or consistency, and he needs to be able to. On top of becoming a way better defender, but that's another issue.  Additionally Utah needs to sign an actual back up ball handler because if Conley isn't in the game then your play making is really poor. Mitchell isn't great at it, Clarkson is horrible at it, so you're left with Ingles being your point forward and he just is not gonna cut it. Maybe they throw cash at TJ Mcconnell or something in the off season.   They also need to get a dynamic 3/4 defender to plug up a lot of holes on defense for them, and I suppose primarily to avoid situations like this. Someone like a Covington, a JaMychal Green, or Crowder who can effectively guard 3s and 4s in a normal game situation and mirror Batum as a super small ball 5 if that pops up again. Bojan can't do that, Ingles can't do that, Favors can't do that, and you can't clone Royce.   Gonna be a real interesting off season for the Jazz."
clown on rudy gobert i guess..
"Did you watch the games?  In game 5 the Clippers slowed the game down dramatically, by playing in the half court and switching off between PG/Reggie at picking Gobert apart. It stopped the Jazz from doing what they wanted to on offense  And well.. I’m sure you didn’t miss game 6. Rudy was a joke"
I need to live in a world where Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert are on the same team.
Rudy gobert and his complete inability to take advantage of a huge size advantage in the offensive end strikes again
"“Rudy bends the game in a way literally nobody else does.  It doesn't show up in stat sheets, and it doesn't appear on highlight reels.  The best way I can explain it is that he stretches the dynamics &amp; possibilities of what can happen on the ""Z"" axis of a basketball court-- both offensively &amp; defensively--in a way that no other player can replicate. And as a result, opponents have to run both offensive &amp; defensive schemes differently vs. the Jazz than they do against literally any other team just to compensate for all the space that is suddenly in play by Gobert's presence.  And if you remove that variable from this specific Jazz team &amp; system, there isnt another center that could contribute enough in other ways to compensate for what would be lost by removing what Gobert does on a different level.  It's so much more than the blocks &amp; screen assists. Utah's historic number of 3's &amp; 3 pt%? That's Rudy Gobert. Mike Conley's league leading +/-? That's Rudy Gobert. Utah's insanely efficient shot chart? That's Rudy Gobert.  I genuinely believe that Rudy Gobert is the most positively impactful player in the NBA, and there isn't a single team in the league that wouldn't be a playoff team if he was on the roster.”"
Gobert was Mann handled; Reggie even made him look like fruity Rudy. He’s too fckin short Pat Beverly victimized the Dpos.
Rudy Gobert winning DPOY is like Russell Westbrook winning multiple mvps  A joke
"I cried. Like, I'm not delusional. Rudy Gobert is extremely limited on offense but there is absolutely no way that Mitchell taking a contested floater through a double team off a bad ankle is a better shot than Goenrt dunking over the 6'5"" Mann. I refuse to believe that we turned down that pass for strategic reasons, I cannot accept that we're that dumb."
But but but Rudy Gobert can block shots when he stands in the paint the whole game
"IMO they don’t need to do much. They need better wings. Bojan, Ingles, Clarkson while being great shooters absolutely let Gobert get exposed by being beat off the dribble every possesion and when rudy went into the paint to help, their rotations were nonexistent. Even Mitchell was guilty of this but Hes good enough offensively to where hes still a plus on the floor. IMO they need to better 3&amp;D players if they want to keep Mitchell &amp; Gobert together. They cant rely on bad on ball defenders funneling their man towards Rudy AND have dog shit rotations. They need more players like Royce and less like Ingles, Bojan. Someone like Mikal Bridges on the suns would be perfect for this team or maybe a Jae Crowder, Torrey Craig type.   We’ll see if I’m right next series though. Maybe the Suns get exposed in the same fashion."
Which narrative do you prefer for what led Rudy Gobert to winning it; the narrative of them having the best record in the NBA or the narrative of them having a top 3 defense?
Rudy gobert has won DPOY three times. Draymond has won it once. How ridiculous is that.
The superstar Rudy gobert 🔥🔥💯
“his inability to exploit size mismatches affects his teams ability to counter certain personnel”  is NOT the same as  “rudy gobert is a defensive liability lol”
"Bucks lose game 5 with Giannis standing in the corner, away from KD.  Fans : OMG COACH BUDD NEEDS TO BE FIRED  Utah loses to a Kawhi-less LAC while getting their zone D exploited every possession. Also leading massively and blowing it.  Fans : RUDY GOBERT IS GARBAGE LOL DPOY!!!"
"I think ~30% of their offense are 3s. Most of the rest is Gobert + Don/Ingles/Bojan/Clarkson pick and rolls. Over and over and over and over. He’s such a big part of both sides of the Jazz game.  In my opinion Rudy is one of the most under-appreciated players in the game. He has flaws that can be exposed, like many great players.   But at the end of the day they build the team around him and what he does well. You can argue Donavan is their best player, and I won’t argue with you really.   But Gobert is heavily involved in sooo many actions on both sides of the balls, and he deserves respect  And let me drop this nugget. You won’t believe this. 29 teams every season either don’t make the playoffs or are eliminated from the playoffs. Every season. Crazy right?"
"He didn’t need to completely bench him, just give him some rest. Gobert went from playing 32 minutes per game The first four to 42 in game 5 and 6.  Even 3-4 minutes of rest may have been enough for Rudy to have the energy to defend into the 4th.   Favors was even playing well for the first time all series tonight and only got 6 minutes."
Rudy Gobert
"This will get lost cause Rudy had a pretty horrible game but my god were the jazz perimeter guys horrible. Conley, Ingles, Clarkson, Mitchell and Bojan basically rolled out a red carpet to the rim all game. Which then forces the weak side (Gobert) into a unusual postion of trying to contest a layup or give up a open 3. His close outs couldve been better but let's just say he sticks to man in the corner and doesn't try to help? Well then the clippers just feast in the paint.  I think partly is because the jazz are so used to Rudy cleaning up mistakes and they just funnel stuff too him so when you play a 5 out there's no one to funnel too. If you get beat bad off the dribble rotations will happen or it's a open lane to the rim or a 3 one pass away. And credit the clippers they made the right reads the entire night. Rudy was forced to be in the paint and contest Mann, batum etc."
Guys guys but Rudy Gobert had a historic QWERTY rating this year
Hence why we're still playing Rudy Gobert (and paying him 200 million) to be Ben Simmons and stand around all day while the other 4 guys play.  (Also fire Quin)
Rudy Gobert bout to go OFF in this game!
Gobert is def a level above Ben but jazz really needs to use him in the PnR and have him play the capela role more often in catching lobs and putback dunks. Rudy also can't be soft.
How is Rudy gobert so soft finishing around the room
So fun watching Rudy Gobert fall apart in the playoffs yet again. I don't wanna hear no shit about him being better than Mitchell ever again.
"Lol I am an analytics guy, always have been. But Rudy Gobert is the peak of ""just watch the game"". Game on the line and teams habitually hunt for the 3x DPOY on the perimeter. Dude ain't even a negative contribution on offence, because to be a negative contribution is to suggest your presence in some or other way changes the equation."
"The Jazz offense wasn't the problem even when the Clips were blitzing Donovan and Jordan. Rudy put pressure on the rim and drew defenders each time. That left a shooter open usually but the Clippers rotated beautifully and got deflections if the Jazz weren't perfect. Going to 5 out might've made it a little easier offensively but they would've gave up even more point through open layups at the rim or just as wide open 3s if the Jazz rotated. For the season, the Clippers scored 1.21ish points per attempt on 3s, even higher in the series around 1.23. They scored about 1.34 points per attempt inside the restricted area, and i'm guessing way higher than 1.34 in the restricted area against non Rudy Gobert defender. I'd rather test my luck with the 3s than give up 2 points 3 out of every 4 possesions with my best defensive rebounder on the bench."
I don't ever want to hear Rudy Gobert being touted as a better defender than (healthy) Anthony Davis. Bum ass walmart Eiffel tower is unplayable against corner 3s
On offense: Rudy Gobert doesn't shoot so he clogs the lane every play. And he doesn't post up either. If you have a shooter instead of Rudy then suddenly there are wide open driving lanes especially when the clippers send help to Mitchell. Rudy Gobert is actually a net negative on offense if he's not punishing the clippers small lineups.  Defensively probably doesn't help. Except maybe you force the clippers into more 2s instead of 3s. Or they shoot worse from 3  because they are actually being rotated out to. Worth a shot
"\&gt; He can defend on the perimeter  Imagine watching Rudy in the playoffs in general and saying this  \&gt; It has nothing do with his defense.  It does. It means he's not good at perimeter defense.  \&gt; Gobert is not a liability  But he is. Clippers strategy was revolved around exploiting Gobert who Utah builds their own strategies around.  \&gt; but what legitimate 7-1 guy can defend players a foot shorter than him  It's tough for bigger guys, sure, but Embiid is significantly better than him at this. Unless you literally mean someone who is 7'1"" which would be a stupid argument.  \&gt;  how bad of a contract he's on  40+ mil for a center who can't shoot the ball in the 3 ball era, gets attacked &amp; continuously gets exposed in the playoffs, and whose entire offensive skillset is dunks and putbacks. Take it from a 6ers fan with a point guard who can't shoot the ball, that's a bad contract."
"he’s a great defender—against the right lineup  just like Pat Bev 😏  srs.   you play Rudy Gobert vs Bucks, but not Clips—Clips expose him.   just like you play Pat Bev vs Jazz, not Mavs—Mavs expose him.  difference ain’t the player… it’s how their coaches used—or didn’t use—them."
"I’ve been telling them for fucking years that Gobert is holding them back. They always laugh at me. If Rudy Gobert is your second best player you will never, EVER sniff a title"
"Rudy would be a good adittion, it's just his contract that is attrocious.   I'd rather take Javale on a minimum contract than Gobert on a max, let alone a supermax."
"It wasn’t Rudy getting exposed it was every other Jazz defender allowing open lanes to the basket like a walking conga line. Rudy can’t stop the layup that Conley, Mitchell, Bogdanovic, Clarkson, and O’neale give up and close out to the corner three at the same time. Jazz have terrible defenders besides Rudy and that was what was exposed. The system the Jazz run was what was exposed more then anything. Not saying Gobert does not have shortcomings because he does especially with his offense."
I would have done something! Favors i think defends the 3 point line better than Gobert. But doing the same thing over and over and over is what lost this series for them. Rudy got completely exposed.
"There are 82 game players and 16 game players.  Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell."
...exposing Rudy Gobert
In the 2018 the Rockets played Gobert off the court with their bevy of shooters.  It's very fun seeing future teams use the Rox playbook to neutralize Gobert.   NBA writers have been saying this for years.  Take for example [The Ringer's article](https://www.theringer.com/2018/4/6/17204586/rudy-gobert-utah-jazz-defensive-player-of-year) written over 3 YEARS AGO saying the exact same thing about Gobert's woes during the playoffs.
We'll give them Tacko Fall for Rudy Gobert
Nope you've specifically brought up Rudy gobert for the past 7 comments or so in a row with some emojis as if I'm supposed to give a shit about Rudy gobert. Not sure what youre point is here
"Well I’d at least say it’s inept to not do **anything** to try and stop the bleeding. Like, at least *try* going small ball to match them, or hell, run man with 4 guards and try to keep up by straight scoring. However, I also think Snyder was backed into a corner when Gobert got exploited. He is literally **the** defensive anchor to their team. Their defensive game plan is usually try not to leave the perimeter open, and funnel shots into the paint where he can dominate. doesn’t work as well against a team with 3+ shooters, especially since no starter other than Rudy can play good defense.   Overall, I’d say this collapse is 45% on the team matchup being terrible for the Jazz, 50% on Snyder for not at least throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks, especially starting the series up 2-0 and the Clippers losing a superstar, and 5% on Gobert for not even attempting to try anything but stand in the paint watching Mann for 3 seconds while he sets his feet for the 3."
"He wasn’t sitting in the paint except for when they tried 2-3 zone a handful of times where that’s literally what he is supposed to do. And they didn’t rotate at all when they were covering man on man. You can see Joe Ingles literally flat footed and starring at Mann while hugging Morris on some of the highlights of his threes on here.   The issues with the Jazz were they’re unathletic and slow on the perimeter if they’re not just small. Gobert had to cover for that on drives by coming off his guy sitting in the corner because it was either a three or an easy lay up, and the Jazz just let it be an easy three every time.   Just because you have Brook Lopez suck for his reasons doesn’t automatically mean that’s why Rudy got shat on."
Rudy Gobert will never win another DPOY no matter how well he plays in the regular season.
"rudy wouldn't guard those players. PG/Reggie would drive, force Gobert in the paint, then kick it out to Gobert's man. Or pass the ball around to Gobert's man kicker than he can rotate"
Ty Lue a chessmaster ♟ exposed Rudy Gobert 🏳 standing there like he really was an Eiffel Tower 🗼  sends ‘Pfizer P’ to drive and distract 👨‍⚕️ then the other 4 spread out for their ‘shots’ 💉
&gt; Let’s talk about Rudy Gobert  what do you think we been doing every play-offs?
I won't have to see the possibility of Rudy Gobert lifting the Larry O'Brien trophy.   #Thank you Clippers
What is it about a man crying that you find threatening? Rudy Gobert is better at defensive basketball than I will ever be at anything. He plays hard and is a leader. He could cry over nothing and I’d still respect him. What’s your issue with a man crying?
"His inefficient ball hog style of play contributes little to winning so I don't really have to appreciate it. He represents the exact kind of player I despise; a selfish player whose negative BBIQ hurts their team. I prefer players like Danny Green, Rudy Gobert, Kyle Lowry, smart players who know their role and don't harm their teams by shooting 47% TS."
"Honestly, not really. The same way that I don’t think Rudy Gobert is a HoFer. I don’t mean to be disrespectful to great defenders. I just don’t think either moves the needle enough to warrant it. But that’s just me."
Too many people forget that we were awful before Gobert came along. It’s been too long in Minnesota for people to turn a blind eye to the fact the KAT just doesn’t do much to help a team win. Making the playoffs once as an eighth seed while being clearly the second best player on his team doesn’t compare to what Rudy does.
"Mark Eaton, Adrian Dantley, Pete Maravich, Jeff Hornacek are some of our other greats, but I'm not sure I'd choose any of those over Gobert and Mitchell. Mitchell has such a passionate, wholesome drive to win every single game he plays. He leaves it all out there *every time.* And it's no exaggeration to say that Gobert defines the team. This team would not work without him keeping the paint locked down for everyone else to focus on perimeter defense and individual match-ups.   Literally the only reason I would hesitate to put Rudy and Donovan in the same echelon as Stockton and Malone is because they're young, and the latter pair had incredible longevity. But Mitchell and Gobert keep playing this way, they'll have their jerseys up in the rafters in no time. It's great time to be a Jazz fan."
"I’m kinda surprised only 34% had Gobert as third team. I’ll assume most that didn’t have Embiid second team had Rudy, but who’s getting votes for center for All-NBA outside of Jokic/Embiid/Gobert? Bam?"
"The logic people have for Ben is so crazy. Replace the name Ben Simmons with any other 6’11+ player that can’t shoot, and it sounds silly.   “Rudy Gobert just needs to shoot 3s during the regular season and eventually he’ll get better at them”  Then they say it’s Bc he’s labeled a PG. So I guess Philly should just start calling him the PF and everyone would leave him alone"
"Bc it’s not common for 7fters who can’t shoot to develop a shot while in the NBA. Nobody was clamoring for D12 or Rudy Gobert to develop 3pt shots. Seems like just Bc they both handle the ball, some of you all think they’re able to develop a jumper.   If it was as simple as taking 3s in game and you become a better shooter, there would be no bad shooters in the league.  Free throws is a great example. Players work on them in practice, stars take plenty of them during the season. But everyone doesn’t improve and become league average or better at them.   Everyone can’t just develop a jumper"
"The LEBRON stats would support your claim.   &amp;#x200B;  |Name|DLEBRON|OLEBRON|LEBRON| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Nikola Jokic|0.61|6.22|6.83| |Rudy Gobert|5.09|1.00|6.10| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|1.98|3.59|5.57| |Joel Embiid|1.54|4.02|5.56| |LeBron James|1.38|3.88|5.26| |Stephen Curry|\-0.70|5.93|5.24| |Kawhi Leonard|1.28|3.62|4.90| |Luka Doncic|\-0.74|4.76|4.02| |Damian Lillard|\-1.73|5.46|3.74| |James Harden|\-0.80|4.49|3.69| |Anthony Davis|1.67|1.84|3.51|  The data comes from here.   https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/  It is interesting to see that according to this stat Jokic (MVP) and Gobert (DPLOY) are as impactful as each other but Jokic offensively and Gobery defensively.   Also I find it interesting that of the people you named, you got most of the top in the league but missed a few. Jimmy Butler (LEBRON 5.56), Paul George (LEBRON 4.30), Jayson Tatum (LEBRON 3.99) , Zion Williamson (LEBRON 3.78)."
"""Rudy Gobert is the best player in the league. Look at these 76 made up advanced stats and these 13 graphs with more stupidly named advanced stats as proof"" - Jazz fans"
Rudy Gobert and Kyrie
"That's it, people are casually ignoring that if Marcus Morris shoots 40% from 3, which by the way would be WAY below his season average, Rudy becomes instantly unplayable/not so effective.  The reason Rudy can stay on the floor against the Clippers small ball lineup is because their shooters are missing wide open shots, which allows Rudy to roam in the paint and stop the drive.  The Clippers have the lineup to make Gobert ineffective, Jackson-PG-Kawhi-Batum-Morris is their idea for it, but they need to hit the open shots. If the open shots fall, Kawhi and PG will have an open highway to the basket."
"He will never figure out how to posterize the DPOY with efficiency. If he gets 1/15, Rudy Gobert will take those numbers all day.   He’ll get one and feel like a badass, but it’s just a low % shot at the end of the day. If Mitchell started heaving half court 3s it’s be rad when it eventually works, but if it takes 15 tries I don’t want him doing that in a game.   The playoffs are not a time to try to be cool, you have to do what it takes to help the team win."
I mean he thought if he called a timeout at the end of game 1 we would’ve subbed out Rudy Gobert on defense so there’s a chance
"I actually think that one-on-one defending abilities are easier to quantify than what Rudy does. You can quantify how many possessions a particular player guards a particular opponent. You can quantify how well a player shoots when a particular defender guards them, and then compare that to the player's averages to see if that defender defends better or worse than average. [Play around with NBA.com's stats to see what I mean.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/202695/head-to-head/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;Matchup=Offense&amp;sort=MATCHUP_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1)  Compare that to what Rudy does as a help defender, where he slides over and helps contest shots against someone he's not the primary defender for. Or better yet, think of the classic Rudy situation where opponents are deterred from ever driving in to the paint in the first place, because they know who's waiting for them there.  You're right that defensive analytics don't do a great job of capturing the full picture of what a defender's impact truly is. That's why it's better to use a number of them, because each one is somewhat better at capturing different aspects of a defender's game. And [when every single defensive metric comes to the same conclusion](https://mysportsanalysis.com/blogs/sports-fivethirtyeight/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history) - that Rudy is an all-time great defender - then that's a stronger data point than simply a single metric coming to that conclusion."
"I was thinking about this the other day, is Rudy Gobert the player in the NBA with the most gravity of anyone?   On offense, he's not Steph Curry, who basically locks a defender out from being able to help (even if his man _should_ be the help defender) and can also pull in a shade defender if his man slacks off, but he's the guy that you target for your defensive mismatches.   Rudy has the most repulsive force of any defender in the league, and he sucks in two defenders every time he screens and rolls to the rim. It's bonkers how much of the game on both sides of the court revolves around ""where's Rudy?"" I don't know if any other player has that, which is nuts."
He could be Rudy Gobert while being able to have more of an offensive game and be able to rip and run.  He could be the most versatile switching center in the league - instead of a pseudo 4 chucking ugly jumpers.
Rudy Gobert
"Casuals also hear “____ can guard all 5 positions” and think that’s so cool they should be DPOY. I mean yes that’s cool but that just means they have the ability to keep up with all kinds of players. Don’t mean they actually stopping shit.  Meanwhile, defensive presence is so underrated these days. The fact that the presence of Gobert/Mutombo/Howard/Wallace inside already deters paint attacks and they alter shots by the mere fear of getting blocked is overlooked. I haven’t even touched how great Gobert is at defending pick and rolls by his mere length like he checks the ball carrier and the roll man at the same time it’s crazy (AD is also great at this btw).  So, yeah, I’m sorry Ben Simmons fans but Rudy deserves it and he might actually win more."
Rudy Gobert stays getting disrespected 🤣🤣
Rudy Gobert is a top 10 player and is more valuable than Damian Lillard
Paul George pushed off a Gobert with his elbow and they still called a foul on rudy
"this is why debates about defense irks me. If you want to say ""best defender"", it should be an all encompassing term about all facets of defense, so calling him the best defender in the league by a wide margin is hyperbole. If you want to point to accolades, that's fair, but there a plenty of defenders who have better defensives skills than Gobert, if you want to also talk about on ball defense, switching, help defense etc. And so much of defense is also about teamwork and communication, that's partially what makes Draymond so good is because he knows his system and can communicate with his team what to do in real time. The Jazz have such a great defense not just because of Gobert but because they know their scheme, execute it well and have good on ball defenders.   I just don't know how you weigh those different defensive skills in relation to one another to declare the ""best defender"" but awards and recognition in recent years has typically gone to big men because it is easier to digest their impact with counting stats like blocks and things like contested shots/FG% at rim.  So pointing to accolades means less to me when it comes to defense, esp when you have greats like KD or Kobe say Tony Allen was the best defender they ever played but he has no DPOY awards.   If the game is on the line and Kawhi has the ball in isolation, who is the best defender to put on him? Gobert or O'Neale?   Defense is about a totality of skills, and which skills you value more can be up for debate. Defensive stats have always sucked and is much more team dependent so its much harder to delineate who ""the best defender"" is.   Rudy is an elite defender, and this guy gave him his due and you came in and had to be all defensive for some reason and tried to correct him on something that is much more complex then just ""3x DPOY""."
"Rudy ""Bill Russell"" Gobert"
Did Rudy Gobert write this post?
"Yah. I guess as jazz fans we benefit from actually seeing the statistical breakdowns. It’s true that other bigs have had great games against the jazz, but what the coaches and gms want to see are the stats born out over longer periods, and maybe even break those down further to high leverage situations. If you looked at those numbers, you would see that other bigs are below their averages against rudy. You’d also see that Gobert just had the most dominant defensive season since they started capturing more granular stats than just rebounds and blocks and stuff. Now, I’d imagine that bill russell probably had some equally dominant seasons, but we don’t know (statistically). What we do know is that rudy is playing like an all time great on defense, against other bigs, against teams without traditional bigs, in general. If you disagree it’s because you don’t believe the statistics (your prerogative), or you’d just like to reinforce what you already thought about the guy (also your prerogative but kind of obstinate and immature imho). It’s fun and interesting to take a dive into those kind of numbers if you’re into that kinda thing. I recommend it. Maybe even more fun than trolling."
"Don’t get me wrong, I think embiid is a generational talent, and a great rim protector, but he is nowhere near as impactful on defense as Gobert. He could be though. The way Gobert hedges to buy an extra split second on defense is a skill that embiid would really need to work on, among a few other defensive discipline issues. Rudy will never come close to embiid on offense though. Still I think I’d rather have Gobert, but I admit I’m probably in the minority there."
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rudy Gobert. The defensive impact is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical spacing most of the efficiency will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rudy's foolish outlook, which is deftly woven into his touching of microphones - his personal philosophy draws heavily from JaVale McGee literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these blocks, to realize that they're not just hot - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rudy Gobert truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rudy's existential catchphrase ""Omelette du Fromage,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Tony Parker's French epic Le Laboratoire de Dextre. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Quin Snyder's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rudy Gobert tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the Royce O'Neale's eyes only- And even he has to demonstrate that he's within 5 +/- points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."
This is bullshit. Rudy Gobert is the best player in Jazz history.
"Oh ok. I guess Rudy has just been lucky for the last 4 seasons in a row.  The simple fact is that teams are much more hesitant to shoot at the rim against Gobert. When they do the shoot a lower percentage in general. Jazz defenders know this and can be more aggressive. This leads to lower shooting percentage in the paint area, and a better overall defense."
Rudy Gobert vs Dwight Powell. I mean yeah.
Rudy Gobert is a pretty good defender
You are pointing to one game with Drummond when Rudy routinely made Drummond look bad. Embiid and Jokics Career numbers when being guarded by Gobert are below their averages. They often feast when Gobert is on the bench. That last Embiid game go check his numbers when Gobert was guarding him. If you can’t even take the time to go educate yourself about that (the stats are out there) then  at least stop yapping your ignorance to me ok?
You throw around abused alot for what is usually “takes a bunch of shots and shoots a bad percentage against him when being guarded by Gobert”. I see this shit all the time by Gobert haters. Really Jokic is the only big recently that has truly cooked Rudy and alot of that was just him hitting contested shot after contested shot.
"Mostly just down to different competition. The Clippers don't have that elite pick and role player. PG is just an ok pick and role player. Less than a point per possession as a pick and roll ball hander the last few seasons. And, Kawhi is decent but he lacks the killer shooting. Only 32% on pull-up 3s. Both are below-average playmakers out of the pick dan roll. Neither of these guys are going to abuse a big in pick and roll or need to be guarded 30 feet from the rim.    Gobert got cooked pretty thoroughly by the Jamal/Jokic pick and role to the point he had to be taken out of the action. Denver had a 124 offensive rating when Gobert was on the court last playoffs. There was some hot shooting involved, and the Jokic/Jamal pick and roll is one of the best plays in basketball. Having said that Rudy hasn't had to face any of the best pick and roll players yet these playoffs. Your Luka's, Dame, Kyrie, Trea etc"

I guess it explains why he always yells “The power of Dwight compels you!” before slapping Rudy Gobert
72% of the planet earth is covered with water. The rest is covered by Ngolo Kante and Rudy Gobert.
CP3 jukes the shit out of rudy gobert every time lmao
"No one else caught DPOY Rudy Gobert flopping as though Boogie clawed his eyes out, pop up the second he heard the whistle, then wink directly at the camera? Good basketball!  11:43 in the second."
Put him in the Rudy Gobert role in the Jazz offense. He'd be far better at it. Screen and roll all day long.
"I think Gobert, Royce and Bogdonovich deserve credit for the clamps. It's not easy to keep those two in check. Rudy with the rim support gives the other two leeway to play more aggressive than what they are used to. Credit to Beverly tonight. He nearly turned the tide emotionally when the rest of the roster seemed pretty disengaged."
"Am I Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense? Is Rudy Gobert a ghost, and I’m the only one on this earth that can see him?   My man got the switch onto 5 foot 10 REGGIE JACKSON on the pick and roll a *DOZEN TIMES* in the 4th quarter and they maybe found him ONCE. I’m not even counting the vast majority of the game where Nic Batum, an undersized 4, was assigned to him.   Most of the time the result of the play when they ignored Rudy was a contested 3 (and yeah they made a few of them). The clippers were BEGGING them to get the ball to Rudy for an easy dunk. And I put most of the responsibility on Donavan Mitchell.   For a guy who gets MVP chants (which frankly don’t mean shit anymore because everyone who’s the best player on their team gets them) Donavan Mitchell just AINT it as a creator for others man. And I say that after being dazzled by his scoring performance tonight.   This game was won by his scoring, but it was also almost lost because he fell WAY too in love with his own shot in the 2nd half. For every sick layup where he split a triple team, he had 3-4 bad possessions where he got pickpocketed, bricked a 3, or couldn’t make a super tough paint shot because he was TRIPLED TEAMED. That’s how the lead dried up.   They need to find a way to fucking punish the clips for their lack of size. They gotta find Rudy for more easy buckets. Mitchell needs to distribute. Or the clips can find their way back in this thing. Mitchell isn’t going to get 40 every game. Most of his shots were TOUGH shots tonight."
"Donovan Mitchell is my favorite player, but Rudy Gobert is hands down better."
"there’s no fucking way you think Rudy Gobert is better than Kawhi, Luka, and Steph"
"But by that logic if Gobert took a few threes a game he'd no longer be a traditional big, even if he played the game the same otherwise.   Embiid does everything Gobert does, just also does more on offense. It's not like he's Davis Bertans or something. Embiid is easily the second best rim probably in the league. The only other time is see so many people just avoid the rim other than when I'm watching Sixers games, is when I'm watching Jazz games. And Rudy challenges way more shots, than Embiid, who likes to pick his spots and let his reputation do a lot of the work."
"This Jazz team looks like a championship team without a clear 1st player and they want to crown Mitchell.  He is world-class in his role, just like Gobert, Clarkson, Bogdanovic and every other role player on their team.  In G1 Rudy won the game and today it was Bogdanovic.  But even without that trio, they have guys like Ingles, Favours, Royce making winning plays on both ends in key moments."
"That’s the reason why the Jazz are getting up 39 three point attempts, Clippers are sticking to Gobert.  It’s either infinite 3’s or Rudy dunks, and the Clippers have elected to let Utah shoot 3’s"
"mike conley is godly at finding gobert, when he comes back there will be a lot more lobs to rudy"
Rudy Gobert
"&gt;Do you read anything I say? I literally said if you split up the Heat and the Warriors the outcome is the same.  No it's not. Bron, Wade, and Bosh would still be stars on their own. Draymond wouldn't.  &gt;That year, they all would have been. Klay would be even now, and Dray back then was DPOY. Unless you don't consider Gobert a star, which just shows you're a buffoon.  No they wouldn't have(at least for Dray). Being a dpoy doesn't mean you can be a star on a team. Put Draymond on a shit team and he wouldn't stand out at all. Rudy Gobert would still stand out as a star on a shit team. Draymond wouldn't."

Rudy Gobert gonna release Covid-21 if they don’t win the series
PG extends his elbow into Gobert but it's a foul on Rudy. Fuck off.
Because RUDY DPOY GOBERT
RUDY GOBERT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY OF THAT $40M  CHANGE MY MIND
Rudy Gobert is a scorer actually
"BIG RUDY FKN GOBERT , TO SMALL"
Rudy Gobert game-winning 3
Haven’t played since 2k15 on the 360 but my past self shudders at whatever sicko drafts Rudy Gobert as their franchise player
"The NBA community likes analytics, narratives, and fun basketball. Rudy Gobert is the perfect representation of everything modern NBA fans don't want to see in basketball. He doesn't shoot 3's, doesn't defend multiple positions, slow, back to the basket, not flashy, analytics and modern basketball theory prove that Rudy Gobert sucks...But then he plays good and wins basketball games. Their Is a reason why players like Robert Covington, P.J Tucker, and Zion are beloved. They represent the type of basketball fans want to see. Gobert isn't that."
Rudy Gobert. The best cornerback in the NBA
"If we’re taking both as prospects, then yeah. Rudy was a mediocre prospect who made huge strides. But if Gobert is 21 and I know what he’s going to become, I take Gobert without question. I love Melo but the odds of him having a HOF career (and Gobert does have a HOF resume, if Ben Wallace is in Gobert should be too) are low, it’s just hard to reach that level."
"If I’m starting a franchise from scratch, I’m taking Mitchell over gobert with no hesitation. Not once have I thought of the Jazz as Rudy gobert’s team"
"Obviously rn gobert is better than Lamelo, but in the original post I asked where you would draft Rudy in a league wide redraft. If I was rebuilding a franchise, based on his potential and flashes of talent this season alone, I would 100% draft lamelo over gobert, no question."
"As a Hornets fan that is an absolutely fucking ludicrous take. Melo was very good for a rookie, but he’s inconsistent, his defense was bad, and he’s not an especially reliable shooter. Gobert is an offense-warping human wall who shows up night-in, night-out. Teams alter their gameplan to get away from Rudy, look at PG chucking up threes instead of attacking the rim in game one."
Is Derrick Favors worse at defense now compared to what he used to be or is Rudy Gobert just that good that he makes everyone look bad at defense who backs him up? I remember thinking Favors having all defensive potential but just never developed to have it.
"Top 7. In the NBA, you’re saying there are only 6 players you would take before Rudy Gobert. Who are those 6?"
On god. If I was starting a franchise right now I would take lamelo ball over Rudy gobert. I could realistically make an argument for at least 30 players I would start a team with before him
Got into a fierce argument about why Gobert is a better defender than Kawhi &amp; Draymond. My take is simple: Rudy alters &amp; blocks shots at the rim at a level that is independent of scheme &amp; complimentary personnel. Can’t be said for others. His ability would stand alone on all 30 teams. If I was starting a defense from scratch I’d pick Gobert as the anchor.
"Clearest example of this is 2-3 years ago, when Rudy was out for a big chunk of the year. Without him we had one of the worst records in the league, even with the Suns the season they landed the 1st pick IIRC. Gobert comes back, we start killing it and end up 5th seed."
"These are 11 players that I think everyone should rank over Gobert.      LeBron, KD, Curry, Giannis, Harden, Kawhi, Jokic, Embiid, Luka, Lillard, Davis.      Could you then rank Rudy 12th? You'd probably have him in the mix with CP3, Trae, Tatum, Mitchell, Beal, Kyrie, KAT and Butler."
"Not in order but 15 players I’d happily take above Rudy Gobert off the top of my head: LeBron, KD, Kawhi, Curry, Harden, Luka, AD, Jokic, Tatum, Booker, Embiid, Giannis, Lillard, Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell"

Bucks (but everyone is replaced by mooses except for brook lopez who can’t tell what’s going wrong on defense)  7. The Utah jazz (except all their players are replaced by a speaker playing jazz music except for Rudy gobert who is not sure what’s going wrong on defense)  8. The Hawks (without trae young)"
The other day I saw somebody say that Nic Batum and Rudy Gobert look like Pokémon evolutions of Tony Parker and I can’t stop thinking about it
Wtf. Did he just compare RUDY GOBERT (who is building a case to be one of the most impactful defenders OF ALL TIME) to Andre Drummond on stats alone (knowing that stats are inherently bad for recording actual defensive value)?
rudy gobert would lock up shaq
if i birthed rudy gobert i’d look like that too
Rudy Gobert won the Rudy Gobert award
rudy gobert probably so good at making love
rudy gobert hella handsome
This sounds mean but if you’re a diehard Jazz fan and you decide to cop a Rudy Gobert jersey over a Donovan Mitchell there’s some mental issues there that need to be sorted out
rudy gobert about to go for 7 blocks tn
"Yeah, what crazy esoteric stats like points per game and field goal percentage. Only found in the deep recesses of secret nba stat pages that are privy to only the most intensive front office data scientists.   Ayton and Gobert have different scoring games, but the results are the same volume with better efficiency for Gobert. Rudy also does more things that don’t show up on the box score like set more (and better) screens and puts more foul pressure on the opponent."
"Perhaps not, but are there any excellent defensive centers to trade for or sign last season? Rudy Gobert was a free agent, but he signed to a near-supermax. They probably would have traded for Horford, which might have worked out with Luka and Booker.      Ayton worked out better for the suns, though. Rare case of drafting fit over talent."
"Giannis is a Greek Rudy Gobert, only difference is that Gobert plays to his strengths and knows he is not a threat offensively"
"It was completely down to Gobert and Embiid (Davis finished 3rd with his team 14th in defense compared to 1st and 3rd for Rudy and Joel, respectively) and the difference in their playing time was 96 minutes across 7 games, which isn't a particularly large gap. In comparison, the gap between Jokic and Embiid this year was 903 minutes across 21 games. If Embiid had missed fewer games, making the playing time gap between he and Gobert larger, he would've won."
"He's a power forward/small ball C that's not quick at all and not really a threat to drive.  Not trying to hate though, Rudy Gobert is an amazing player that deserved DPOY and I hope you guys smack the Clippers tonight. I want to see Suns/Jazz so bad"
"Well yes, thats low compared to other generational plagues. Still unfortunate that the sick got to so many with pre-existing conditions.   Utterly unacceptable of the sick to do that.   I tell you what, I will write a strongly worded letter to the sick, and copy Rudy Gobert on it, and tell the sick to stop it, or else you will get very angry.   /s"
Why the fuck would the 76ers trade for Rudy Gobert when they have Joel Embiid? Gobert can’t score in the playoffs either. Did you even think about this before posting?
Absolutely not why in the hell would anyone want to pay Rudy Gobert who can’t do anything outside the paint especially when he makes 35mil for the next like 5 years? At least Ben is arguably the best defender and one of most versatile defender in the NBA can guard any position and is a very very good playmaker
"True. Maybe he wants to try being in a big market for the first time in his career.  But I think it's not clear he wants to use that leverage. He was someone who was happy to play in Memphis for a long time, and has said all the right things about enjoying Utah, so I'm not sure what evidence there is that he will leap at the chance to uproot his family to a huge city so he can play for a workhorse in Thibs - think he'd play Conley less to protect Conley's hamstring? - and be the focus of attention for the NYC media market.  And even if he does decide to leave, I think getting Simmons as his replacement would be an act of panicking. Sure, you get a better defense against the 2 teams in the league that are legitimate threats to play 5 out, but you ruin any spacing you have whatsoever on offense against every single other team, because Rudy Gobert might be the one person in the league with a more limited range than Simmons."
"5 pts (2-4) 13 assists/2 turnovers 8 rebounds +1 in 36 min  literally the only ""bad"" thing was the fact that he only shot the ball 4 times... but that's like getting mad at Rudy Gobert or Marcus Smart for not taking more shots- that's not his role, he's an ace defender and a ball-handler/playmaker not a scorer  nice try tho"
"I don't really mean to say defense is overrated per say, but I don't agree with Offensive and Defensive EPM being weighted the same. I mean hell, Ben Simmons had EPM close to Trae on the year (+3.1) with basically the inverse offense/defense EPM. Rudy Gobert got exposed a bit as well. Ultimately, at least in today's NBA offense trump's defense. You need dudes who can get buckets to close out games.   And as for Clint Capela's impact, I'd argue that his impact on offense as a lob threat on pick and rolls has been a larger factor in the postseason than his defense, that's the only way a player of his type doesn't get exposed for his lack of shooting ability."
"You just seriously compared Rudy Gobert to the most game breaking offensive player arguable in the history of the NBA, someone who changed the way the sport is played forever and a 3x champion because he missed the playoffs while putting up MVP numbers?? to RUDY GOBERT? Brought his team to the brink of the playoffs with what you just called a G League team while leading the league in scoring and you’re trying to compare him to a guy who’s team led the league in 3PT% and the best record in the league? Bro you must be out of your goddamn mind. Ofc basketball is a team game and ofc there’s only so much one player can do but it wasn’t like his team was sorry or he was the only star, he had the 6MOY and the runner up AND DMitch. He had a good team around him and he wasn’t contributing shit, they should’ve taken him out and it’s not his fault he just doesn’t have the skill set to make them pay. He has no offensive game, couldn’t punish them on the boards and even when he played his role as a rim protector he didn’t get any blocks the last two games. He shouldn’t have been in the game and I’m sorry if you can’t play your star when you need him the most then what value does he bring in terms of winning a championship."
"The Supermax is honestly just a horribly executed idea, and needs to be reformed or done away with entirely, how can you realistically build a winning team with one person eating up cap like that? I know the logic is to give stars incentive to stay with their original teams but with the amount of money that has to be paid out is insane, it cripples teams so much that most of the team it keeps teams mediocre or stagnant without any real hope for improvements in the future. And to be completely honest there maybe 5 or 6 players at any given time genuinely worth that money, yet guys like Embiid and Dame, are eligible, not to mention fucking Rudy Gobert is allowed to be eligible? Absolutely ridiculous."
Taking a day off from the fuck Rudy Gobert and fuck Paul George day
"Out of curiosity I ranked players by PPG to see how many have a negative AST/TO. The only players with negative ratios in the top 100 are:    Embiid - 2.8/3.1   MPJ - 1.1/1.3   John Collins - 1.2/1.3   Clint Capela - 0.8/1.2   DeAndre Ayton - 1.4/1.5   Rudy Gobert - 1.3/1.7   Darius Bazley - 1.8/2.2   Lauri Markannen - 0.9/1.0   Brook Lopez - 0.7/0.9    That’s the list. 91 other players are able to shoulder a scoring burden without having a negative ratio, regardless of their position or role in the offense.   The thing all these guys have in common? No handles. I think if Embiid wants to take another step towards being the most dominant player in the league has has to work on his handles and reading the defense when he’s double-teamed in the post."
I'd still rather have Draymond Green on my team than Rudy Gobert. Downvote me if you want.
Rudy Gobert can play center.  If Simmons was able to play center he wouldn't be such an issue to fit around
"He’s just not the next LeBron that everyone thought. He has no offense. As a rockets fan, I would’ve been disappointed if he came to Houston in a Harden trade. I believe the media have just overhyped him based on if he ever learned to shoot the ball, but he won’t. Right now he’s just a shorter Rudy Gobert."
"Lol - he was an all star this season, but now he needs to be in the G-League. I guess we should do the same for Rudy Gobert, since he averages fewer shot attempts per game than Ben."
Is Ben like a more athletic worse rim defending Rudy gobert?
Rudy Gobert won three DPOYs because of it smh
"My bad, I almost forget offense doesn’t matter anymore. It’s almost like Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert taught us the exact opposite, but who knows!"
It is a team game. There is only so much one player can do.  IIRC Steph has the most expensive contract in the NBA right? When is his next playoff game?  Oh wait there isn't one cause he didn't make the playoffs. But we all give him a pass because he plays great but his team is G-league and rightfully so.  It's fine in offence because you can iso and Steph can make shots even when he is contested.  &amp;#x200B;  Defense is a team game. You can't guard all 5 players at once. There is only so much 1 person can do.  You can substitute Gobert with Dray or Giannis or Simmons and their defense would still be the same (I would argue it is worse) because the team is still bad at defense.  If they keep on letting on people drive by them AND leave corner 3s open what is Rudy supposed to do?  Guard the rim or go for 3?  &amp;#x200B;  Gobert certainly had his mistakes but going forward if the Jazz want to improve defense they should not be looking at Gobert first.
"6th man? Come on now the guy who finished 2nd in DPOY voting and averaged 15/8/7 is not a bench player. Rudy Gobert has worse range than Simmons, and is a less versatile defender. Unless Gobert also belongs on the bench you need to readjust your standards"
Few nights ago on Rudy Gobert?
"I agree. Rudy gobert was the best defensive player in his team while Ben was second, meaning that gobert had a bigger task defensively. Though I do think Ben is better defensively. Rudy is a traditional big who is a liability against a five out offense. Ben is nowhere near as much of a liability in the paint than gobert is in the perimeter."
sorry man. at max contract you need to score at least double digits. Even Rudy Gobert scores 10+ point even though he was getting ran out on defense.
"Rudy Gobert was forced to play perimeter defense because his teammates can barely defend at all. Ben Simmons sucks at the most important skill in basketball, which is putting the ball in the basket."
The thing about the Jazz is they followed their game plan.  Defend the 3 at the cost of letting guys by and trust Gobert to protect the rim.   The fact they have no ability to adjust has to do with the entire roster construction not just Rudy   Now all that being said it's really freaking hard to get good D wings into Utah with Rudy taking a max slot.
Rudy Gobert got exposed for the one thing he's supposed to be good at. That deserves more blame
"Rudy got exploited by a mismatch, which was exacerbated by Utah having no good wing defenders. Ben Simmons is actually afraid of scoring, which I've never seen in someone who's a supposed star. You can build a roster around Gobert to minimize his weaknesses, you can't do the same with someone terrified of putting the ball through the hoop."
Rudy Gobert was great but was schemed out of the series.  When the Clippers actually played a center he dominated in the paint defensively.  Simmons schemed himself out the series by being awful.
"Counterpoint: Atlanta became one of the better defense teams when Nate took over. They don't have a lot of individual talent, save Capela, Hunter, and Huerter (at least as a bench leader), but they've schemed their way out of shortcomings. Young and Collins used to be trashed for their suspect defense, and now they're both part of a working machine.  I think 1v1 defense is overrated, there are so many ways to scheme a good defender out of an offensive drive or make a bad defensive player basically close down a passing lane. 1v1 is great, of course, but look at Rudy Gobert: no one is doubting his ability, but just like offense, 'iso defense' is not desirable.   Really good case in point: Seth Curry was cooking in Game 7, similar to Game 6, so Nate decided to put Huerter on him on both offense and defense. Huerter is not an elite defender (unless he clamps down Middleton in the ECF lol), but athletic and a size mismatch on both ends, plus a smart, disciplined player. More importantly, Huerter driving at Curry through the fourth quarter would have pissed me off as a Philly fan: how do you not find a way to switch the defender? Trae is rarely asked to defend a dude 6"" taller than him, and Curry was in that position for far too long.  Lastly, counterpoint to Simmons at the 5: he was afraid to dunk over Trae 'with Gallo behind him', dude does not want to attempt going for FTs. Bench guys can afford to play Hack-a-Ben, so it would have totally stalled Philly's already limited offense. Plus, you'd then start Milton or Maxey as PG/SG with Curry--Trae made short work of a good defender in Danny Green, no way these young guys can keep up with a dude looking to attack every possession."
"You obviously don’t understand defensive schemes. You can’t just take gobert from one team to another and assume he’d play the same way. The suns actually play team defense, the jazz rely on Rudy to be their whole defense. Ayton is not better than Rudy gobert my guy"
"Simmons plays like a bench role player picked in the second round, funny to watch. Need a team with Simmons, Joe Harris, Porzingis, CJ McCollum, Rudy Gobert call it the all-exposed team"
My goodness cmon fam. Have you learned  nothing from Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons. Capela plays a role ans plays it well but it’s the guys who get buckets are the engines. Capela is the 5th best player and maybe even 6th if Hurrter keeps it up Trae-Collins-Bogi-Hunter-Huerter
"Yes, the most dominant offensive center in recent history would score more than Rudy Gobert. Grass is also green."
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2932043-ben-simmons-says-rudy-gobert-guarding-him-was-a-little-bit-of-disrespect   And this was just a couple months ago…..
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2932043-ben-simmons-says-rudy-gobert-guarding-him-was-a-little-bit-of-disrespect  Just going to leave this here.. since there’s a collective goldfish brain around here
It's a better contract than Rudy Gobert and he has been healthy his whole career. So he will play the games it looks like.  If he can get back to his play from a year ago he is fine in that kind of money a year.
"Rudy Gobert with an almost 30 better 63% from the line. If he didn't get embarrassed on defense this would be a fun stat to poke at Sixers fans, but I think we're both just sad at this point..."
Istg bruh Trae Young is more intimidating at the rim than Rudy Gobert
"Swap Gobert for any defender past or present and the same result happens. You can’t expect one person to guard a 40%+ shooter while also having to cover for someone getting beat even without any screening action literally every play. Gobert either helps the guy who gets beat or guards the shooter- it’s physically impossible to do both. Clips playing 5 out exposed all our guys BUT Rudy, especially our injured and small guards."
For real  Rudy Gobert did not get exposed. You can’t expect a traditional big to be able to proficiently guard 1-5.  But this Sixers series is some full frontal public exposure
Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert on the same court for maximum offense
"Problem was regular season we'd funnel shots to Gobert and let him protect the rim. It worked well enough that we never had to adjust, and we didn't face small ball. Clips would expose him by driving past all of our 1-4s and drawing Rudy in, and kick it back out to the open man for a 3. The issue is more we don't have any good 3nD wings outside of Royce."
"rudy is better but Ayton is definitely more of a ""presence"" in terms of like, a physical body thats hard to move than Gobert. Gobert is pretty agile tho i think that's sorta just a shot at Gobert lol"
"Rudy Gobert is a better offensive player. Rudy Gobert, they guy who drops easy passes from Donovan all game long is a better scorer. Ben is almost 7 feet tall, he barely even needs to jump to dunk"
"That's fair enough, but france team had Rudy Gobert, Evan Forunier, Nicolas Batum, and Frank Ntilikina, no all stars level player (you can argue for Rudy Gobert).   USA teams can overcome chemistry issues because of the overwhelming talent, but that wasn't the case that time. You have to admit that the world is slowly catching up in talent."
"but surely a team that consist of Mitchell, Tatum, Brown, Middleton, etc. can beat a team, whom the best player is rudy gobert, no? Basketball is not played on paper, fortunately."
Regular season is a different animal. Regular season Rudy Gobert wins dpoy and in the playoffs he gets torched.
"Draymond can rotate from the perimeter to under the basket. If Utah had both Draymond and Gobert, Gobert would be getting benched for Draymond when the Clippers rolled out a 5-out lineup.  There isn’t a thing Rudy does that Draymond can’t do. He’s more versatile, equally dangerous as a rim protector, and can at least facilitate an offense.  Utah doesn’t have the personnel to defend 5-out lineups and part of that is that they’re paying Rudy $200m to be DPOY of the regular season and then get schemed to death in the postseason."
Ben Simmons got exposed offensively. Rudy Gobert got exposed defensively
"has doc won anything besides the celtics with the firepower? pretty sure it was rondo and pierce who wont that and not him. and ben is overrated, yes. he's just like a smaller Rudy Gobert that can pass."
How much do Rudy Gobert and Draymond Green get paid?
Rudy Gobert easily
Playoff Frauds Starting 5: PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Joe Harris SF: Julius Randle PF: Kristaps Porzingis C:  Rudy Gobert
"To have on a contender? Sure.  If i'm a team on the playoff bubble or rebuilding? Nah.  Maybe in 5 years time he's the same player he is today and his contract was a huge overpay, but maybe in 5 years time he has developed his offensive game and is serviceable in a half court offense and a DOPY. He did drop 40 points on Rudy Gobert this year."
Old and busted : Rudy Gobert Slander  New hotness : Ben Simmons slander
"Just to keep track, these are the players we're allowed to slander, right?    Ben Simmons   Rudy Gobert   Julius Randle"
Ben simmons and rudy gobert.  The two best defenders in the nba!
"Sixers fans were less afraid of getting ejected from the arena than Ben Simmons was on that pass from dunk attempt.  Rudy Gobert is at least a center. You, Ben Simmons are the guy getting the ball, and you didn't defend Young or a hot Huerter even though that would be better than Seth on Huerter."
Rudy Gobert tweeting like he’s one of KD’s burners.
Ben Simmons is a role player. Rudy Gobert too. If you can't put the ball on the floor and you're useless in the 4th you're a role player in the modern NBA.
"Ben Simmons aka Bum Simmons is a bigger bum than Lonzo, like I said the man is just a Rudy Gobert whose playing point guard.  EXCEPT RUDY ACTUALLY GETS BUCKETS"
Can’t be getting paid max money &amp; be complete liability on one side of the ball. I’m looking at you Rudy Gobert &amp; Ben Simmons.
Rudy Gobert is somehow the biggest winner in all this somehow because he no longer has the worst playoff disappearing act from an all star this year lol
Him and Rudy gobert baby
"Ben Simmons, loves seeing Rudy Gobert. Should tell you all you need to know about the Dpoy this year. Bunch of fakers"
"Ben Simmons a bigger bum that Lonzo, man is a Rudy Gobert who plays point guard"
Ben Simmons is like if Rudy Gobert was 3 inches shorter and worse at defense
Was that Trae Young or Rudy Gobert in the paint?
"We're comparing Dray to Rudy, and the point is Gobert doesn't have that in his arsenal at all. I don't know why you're talking about elite point guards."
"actually the stats suggest Ginobili was pretty damn good. His efficiency metrics and net rating are really good. and the stats suggest Tony Parker was borderline all star for most years and low key MVP candidate in others which i think is in line for where he was at for most of those years.   i mean the thing is Rudy Gobert is really good... in the regular season. You can't say those metrics are wrong, they accureately have Gobert as a really good defender...in the regular season."
5-out offenses are designed to create driving lanes and even a defensive team like the lakers would be surrendering some type of advantage against players like PG or Reggie. Therefore the most important thing vs these lineups is actually your ability to rotate and recover to the perimeter. Rudy cant do that and thus they’re surrendering wide open 3s. The reason the scheme worked is specifically because Rudy Gobert can not scramble on defense
He played against Rudy gobert
7 Lottery picks only for an All Star who gets gassed in the second and perimeter Rudy Gobert lmao
[Rudy Gobert liked this tweet](https://twitter.com/TheCelticsStan/status/1406435773537259520)
People were calling Jamal Murray a superstar after last year. Jazz fans think Rudy Gobert is a superstar.
"Nobody thinks Rudy Gobert is cool dude, relax"
"I can't tell who's more overrated, Ben Simmons or Rudy Gobert"
"Well he’s paid $200 million and I just saw clippers role players even burn him even in the paint. They were going straight at him with no fear going for dunks and and ones. They were actively head hunting him and succeeding. Idc if the jazz had shitty perimeter defense, you are the highest paid player on the team, you gotta be able to carry the team on defense because locking down the paint is what he was paid to do and he couldn’t do it. Advanced stats don’t mean shit to me if I’m watching multiple games and Terrence Mann is going at rudy Gobert in the paint and succeeding.  Also don’t forget that Utah still has to pay Mitchell. After that they gotta take care of Bogi, Clarkson and Conley. They are about to be in cap purgatory because of Rudy’s contract"
"Yes, Rudy was being put in an impossible position on defense nearly every possession. It's not the game plan for the on-ball guard to get blown by every play without even needing a screen lol. Incredible that people blamed Gobert for that tragedy on the perimeter."
&gt; Just look at the Gobert shite after game 6  The amount of flairless shit posts about Rudy after that game was so high it was kinda weird.
You did NOT just compare Rudy Gobert to Bill Russell LMAOOOOO
Rudy Gobert should be embarrassed.

Rudy Gobert slander and Booker relying on the midrange has the analytics-only bros in shambles lmao
thank you rudy gobert for doing the scouting report for ayton!
the fact that rudy gobert can't take advantage offensively of the clippers and small ball in general is a big big knock against him
"&gt; Gobert is nothing but a lob threat. He got zero touch and no other offensive skill, he can’t score on guys a foot smaller than him.  And him being a lob threat makes him an offensive weapon. Rudy Gobert is a great offensive weapon in the halfcourt due to the gravity he creates with his rim rolls...Ben Simmons is a minus player in the half court. But dont take my word for it...check all the offense advanced metrics and they will tell you the same thing - Gobert is the more valuable player on offense"
Clippers learning real fast that DA is not Rudy Gobert
True story...i just spent 20 minutes arguing with some dude that said every team would rather have Ben Simmons than Rudy Gobert
"Haha dude, never thought I would get into a random debate about Ty Lue with a Rockets fan...  I won’t insult your team though, would be too easy. Just feel bad for breaking the bad news to you that Ty Lue ain’t nothing special (going 5 out against a Rudy Gobert defense isn’t groundbreaking, sorry). You don’t seem to be taking it well lol"
Rudy gobert
Rudy Gobert isn’t going to cut it as the 2nd best player on a real contender. Need to get someone better
"if you're a threat only 2 feet away from the basket, you're not a PF, you're a rudy gobert."
"WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THIS? His defense was no the issue, that was a team issue. The fact that they could not punish the Clippers on the other end stood at to me as a real problem. Rudy Gobert does not have to be an offensive All Star to beat up Batum or Morris in the post or whoever he gets on a switch on a PnR. Shouldn't the Jazz have been crushing at the rim?"
"You wouldn't have gotten beat if they managed a way to force having Zubac on the floor.  Only make Gobert usefull on offense would help that, and it's many years that the Jazz ignore Rudy there, it came back to bite them."
Lol me too Rudy gobert is so two days ago we only care about KD now
"If a shooter starts heating up in game, doesn't matter if they are a career 10% or career 50% 3pt shooter, you gotta adjust at some point.   But anyways, Rudy isn't completely wrong. They were playing good outside and it did not help that Jazz do not have great perimeter D. I think if they had even one strong perimeter defender, it would've helped Gobert out a lot because he would not have to hedge out to cover for the shit perimeter D."
"I think there's some misinformation here.  First, I don't think Rudy really suffered from foul trouble this series - he had like, one game early where he got in trouble and Favors had to come in, but I don't think it was as consistent as you're making it out to be. There's a perception he's prone to fouling because he was in trouble during the first Memphis game and always has one or two early, but the only game he played less than 30 minutes was in game 3. Every other game was 32 or more, and the only one he really was put into foul trouble early was in game 4.  Second, he was absolutely contributing - look at the Gobert minutes vs the Favors minutes. Gobert went +5 / +14 in the two Jazz wins, whereas Favors was -2 / -8. Several times in the Jazz' two wins, the lead would shrink when Favors was on the floor, and then extend again once Rudy checked back in. That's not a coincidence. When the Clippers played Zubac, Gobert was ridiculously impactful because that's the kind of scheme the Jazz are built to tear apart. In the losses, Gobert was -1, -4, and -16 (in the big blowout where he sat a while) until this most recent game. None of which can be attributed only to Gobert.  Finally, I implore you, *actually watch the game* and *look at what the Clippers are doing offensively* before blaming Gobert. Your Ben Simmons comparison doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Simmons is a man to man defender. If Trae Young blows by him or breaks his ankles or shoots over him or gets him in foul trouble, that's on Simmons. But it's not Rudy's fault when Joe Ingles can't stay in front of Marcus Morris or Donovan on one leg can't contain Paul George. The Jazz perimeter defense was basically nonexistent this series after the Clippers switched to going 5-out, and any Clipper could get to the rim at will, so Gobert was forced to either concede a wide-open layup, or a wide-open three if he decided to close out on whoever was parked in the corner, and the Clippers also hit a bunch of really tough shots over him in that last game. He didn't play his best, definitely, he could have been more impactful. But to pretend like he's solely responsible for the defensive breakdowns happening on the perimeter is really silly.    It's a tough break, and he definitely showed his offensive limitations that game, he couldn't punish the Clippers when there was a mismatch in the post because he's not offensively skilled, and he let himself get pushed out of his spots too much which neutered his ability as a dunker and lob threat, but the defense wasn't his fault. There was a total lack of schematic adjustment to what the Clippers were doing, and a huge lack of effort by Jazz perimeter defense to contain people going to the basket."
"lol capela is 2, idk whats with this rudy fascination, jokic has always abused gobert"
What y’all think about the new Shanghai Sharks roster next season?  PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Joe Harris  SF: Kyle Kuzma  PF: Kristaps Porzingis  C: Rudy Gobert  6M: Dennis Schroeder
Why not put gobert on batum tho? Batum can’t attack like Mann and tbh doesn’t shoot it as well either so Rudy could sag off
At least they have rudy gobert
"Because putting 18 year olds against NBA players has, more often than not in NBA history, resulted in duds. Put a lanky 18 year old center against Rudy Gobert, Embiid, and Giannis and see what happens. *Most of the time* it's going to be significantly rougher, physically, for the kid."
"Man I’ve been big on tanking for teams that it clearly won’t work out for but I mean...the 76ers process has failed and it makes me question that.   Unpopular: Trae Young is not going to be any better than he is right now, he’s never going to be a superstar   Rudy Gobert and Ben Simmons are still top players, they just had awful postseasons that I believe they will bounce back from   Beal &gt; Mitchell &gt; Booker &gt;= LaVine"
"Kawhi left a better organization. Plus, Rudy Gobert is eating up a huge chunk of the cap and the team has constantly underperformed in the playoffs"
Except Ben plays nothing like Gobert on offense and would be a disaster if running at the 5  If you swapped Ben for Rudy straight up the Jazz would be severely worse
"PR did it's job by shutting down the question and protecting their guy.  You guys may hate the answer, but it's a great answer.  If the worse thing that comes out of it is Portland's PR catching heat, it's a win.  Can't run with anything more than what you see.  Portland must have hired Rudy Gobert to shut down that question.  PR can be replaced (and in this case, won't), there's only qualified coaching job (or at least in their eyes.)"
"&gt;They're paying Gobert 200M. I'm not saying he didn't deserve that contract   I'll say it, he doesn't deserve that contract. Or rather, a team tying up that much of the salary cap in a guy with no offensive impact is never going to win. The Clippers are doing well right now even without Kawhi because they're putting 5 man lineups out there where every single player is a good defender who also can contribute on offense. They don't have anyone who can be targeted on defense or played off the floor due to their lack of offense. If you're featuring Rudy Gobert you're never going to be able to field lineups like those, and you're similarly never going to win by sitting a $200 million player on the bench. That contract was a mistake, full stop."
&gt; Gobert doesn't deserve half that contract.  Peak /r/NBA content here.  Rudy only worth $20M per now lmao  Jazz go down because their $30M guard is out and Mitchell is injured and now Gobert is the problem because you guys saw 3 plays where he got scored on from the perimeter (because the rest of his team is so ass defensively he constantly has to hedge towards the basket).
Well Rudy gobert is a 3x all nba player. So by your own rating hes near all nba
Rudy Gobert is the best player on the Jazz.
"That’s an argument that just lacks any understanding of basketball. If Ayton is just getting spoonfed baskets, what is it that Cam Payne and Devin Booker are doing that other teams can’t replicate??? I mean Ayton’s averaging 20 on insane percentages when cp3 is hurt or out of the game.   Rudy Gobert has 5 20+ point playoff games in his career out of 43 games. Ayton has 6 20+ point playoff games in his 15 games and is averaging over 18 a game in the wcf."
Rudy Gobert too
and jazz had rudy gobert getting abused
"Deandre ""Rudy Gobert"" Ayton"
*terance mann dunks on rudy gobert*
PG might be the one player that triggers opposing fans more than Rudy Gobert.
PG- Derrick Favors  SG- Myles Turner  SF- Clint Capela  PF- Udoka Azubuike   C- Rudy Gobert
&gt;Kylian Mbappe having 0 goals in the Euros would be like if Rudy Gobert had 0 blocks in back-to-back playoff games.  What a shit comparison lol. Comparing goals scored to blocks is insanely dumb even for twitter.
"Probably. I mean they got Rudy Gobert to engage with this one, and that’s got Reddit driving traffic to it too."
"Sounds ridiculous in a vacuum, but let's swap in a different top 10 all time dominant force to replace Shaq, and a different 3x DPOY to replace Howard.  It would be like Rudy Gobert wanting to be called the French word for King, or Snake. You'd totally roll your eyes at him. You're severely underestimating the situtation, probably due to a lack of emotional investment / fandom in the player."
imagine sticking up for rudy gobert on twitter 😭😭😭
"&gt;his skill set, especially in today’s NBA is replaceable/replicable for much cheaper than a max  The replacement level at Center is high but it isn't THAT high.  This is a 22 year old who is already a top 5 Center who projects as a top-3 and a top-15 overall player...  saying he isn't worth a max is crazy talk.  If we were talking about the supermax, maybe I'd see your point, but not the max.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There are zero contenders with a guy with his skillset as their second highest paid player  Actually there was, his name was Rudy Gobert and his team had the best record in the league.  But that's a pointless exercise, you could point to all sorts of roster constructions and say it's difficult to be a contender like that, because it is... it's just difficult to be a contender in general."
"So much of the league was injured and a lot of these bum western conference teams(Kings and Pelicans) couldn't even make the playoffs.   The whole Blazers team is about to implode because you guys got stomped by a lethargic center. Play some D!  Hey, Utah! Learn to close out a game and stop relying on Rudy Gobert to do everything for you. Shame, shame, shame. You got the one seed and you managed to be the #1 disappointment this year. Congrats.   Lakers, mostly LeBron, stop depending on that hash brown soft 7fter to be there for you. Trade that man and run it back next year.  Just a little fun, obviously, don't be so hurt."
"False, I don't understand why anyone believes in the Jazz if Rudy Gobert was not going to level up, truly this is astounding to me."
"If Tucker wasn't a good defender he would be making 7.5m/y less. There's absolutely no way he'd be in the NBA. If anything, this is against your argument - defense IS what pays these guys. Now if you can't dribble the ball, can't pass and the only spot you can even take a shot from is the corner, yeah, 7.5m / year sounds good to me.  lol what? You think the Wizards, Bulls, Kings had better scorers at his position and that's why he wouldn't start? Because he wasn't good enough offensively? Your comment is funny, because that's exactly what he averaged playing only 25 minutes per game - 15 PPG on these teams, without starting half / most of the games. How come he couldn't be a starter on tanking teams, I wonder. It's the same story with Enes Kanter. You can't play him on the other end.  Breaking news: Rebounding is part of defense.  Also, Rudy is not a good player offensively. The fact the Jazz need him on the floor on defense and spam PnRs to give him easy dunks doesn't make him a good scorer. His offensive boards are also the outcome of that. PnR &gt; Mitchell / Conley have their layup contested by the opposing center &gt; free offensive rebound and putback dunk for Gobert. You need to re-evaluate what good offense and good defense is.  Lmao what? You think I can't find players that would be out of the league / bench players at best without their defense and actually got paid? Simmons. Draymond. Mutombo. Gobert. Ariza. Wallace. What in the fuck are you talking about friend? There are even players who used to be solid offensively but can't score anymore and still make money because of their defense. Iggy is a good example of that."
"&gt;Which centers aren’t physical? Outside of the teams that have rim runners at center like the Knicks, atlanta or Boston (or no center like Brooklyn)   You just answered your own question. There's other guys too though. The Kings, Warriors and Mavs don't rely much on a bruising post presence, and Rudy Gobert isn't such a player either. Obviously we have to wait and see what every team looks like next year before giving you a complete list, but there's enough teams out there that won't punish small ball that the Lakers could get away with it.  &gt;For a guy with ADs injury problems, it just isn’t worth it to play at center.  I think there's an argument to be made that AD running around on the perimeter on both ends of the floor is maybe even more taxing than it would be to just hang around nearer to the basket on both ends. Look, I don't want to see AD as like the full time center for the Lakers, but I do think he should probably be playing 30-40% of his minutes there. That's like what he did in 2020 and he was fine. This year that was down to less than 10%."
"Here is the problem I have with this argument, and is similar to Rudy Gobert.  When you have a center who supposed to be an inside powerhouse, the staff will setup up arrangments (such as complimentary players, playbooks, etc) to take the most advantage of that capability.  Once you take out that center, you wonder why they play so badly.  This happens a lot during the 90s and early 2000s on teams with good centers.  It reminds me how Lakers were lucky to have both Bynum and Gasol for their 2009 and 2010 championships.  I'm not sure why people even thought up of Shaq playing on a loaded team as the only team that was ""loaded"" was the 2000, 2001, and 2004 season with the Lakers.  If there was 1 player who can claim playing on multiple loaded teams, it would be Robert Horry. 🤣"
"I think Jalen Green has a higher ceiling because it's a guard/wing dominant league, but Mobley is the ""safer"" pick. At worst he can be a defensive anchor at the rim who is also capable of switching onto some guards the perimeter. Even as a USC fan, I'm not totally sold on him as being a top offensive option, but defensively he will be elite. Like a Rudy Gobert/Clint Capela"
There's a reason Rudy Gobert was protecting the paint - it was because his perimeter players were giving it up so easily.
"Omg Pop stfu. You are supposed to beat them by 30. The US has by far the best players in the world. France had RUDY GOBERT starting. That’s not even a top 30 player in the nba like come on. He stays making it seem like it’s not a big deal to lose when it’s a huge deal. Say you’re gonna do your job better, the other teams don’t need a cheerleader"
Yea bro a 6’3 guard is gonna stop jrue holiday attacking the rim witha running start.  Even if it doeshappen the chances of him making it are much higher than hitting a three.   I really dont see how this a debate either Rudy Gobert is at the 3 point line.  Drive.
Rudy Gobert was All Nba btw
"“individual talent” gets defeated by “systematic talent”  laimbeer is a big body who knew how to rough up people, but he knew how to use his size as well. you can have all the talent in the world, but if a big body rough player has a high ball IQ and times his body right in your way, you’re going to have a hard time against that type of pressure, pair that up with an equally rough help defence (team ball). on the offence, go check some clips of isiah and bill laimbeer running pick and pop / pick and roll plays.  finally... you rather have javale mcgee/kevin love as your center? ... bill laimbeer on today’s starting lineup in the olympics would’ve done way better with the type of guards on the team + he would’ve backed rudy gobert down"
Rudy Gobert
Bro fit James Harden would kill Rudy Gobert dead by the 2nd quarter this game. Top 3 playmaker in the world for a reason.
I'll take Rudy Gobert over Bam any day of the week.
"In the earlier 00’s when centers were the focal point of a team and power forwards were utilized as well, those players had trouble playing in the league. They were unable to penetrate and only became spot up shooters.  Later 2010’s and up the center position starting disappearing and the game was becoming more guard oriented. Today , the game is 3 point oriented and the Europeans have been playing that style since at least 1992. This style favors the overseas players in terms of usage. If a player like David Robinson was on today’s team , Rudy Gobert would have a tough time getting into double digits."
"There were some legitimate concerns, though. One is that the lack of size was exposed. And the other is that they really didn't attack the paint effectively. Both of those were exacerbated by facing Rudy Gobert, but that was the case even when he wasn't on the court"
"Once the Clippers went super small (Batum was playing the 5), Gobert got roasted.  No knock on Rudy, he’s not expected to defend on the perimeter for entire possessions.  But the Clips kept him on the perimeter all game, every game from Game 3 on.  That’s on Quinn for not making any adjustments"
"This really has nothing to do with the NBA.  You also realize the other teams have NBA players too, right?  Rudy Gobert?"
"Conley and Mitchell were getting abused in PnR, Gobert was having to cover that by coming off his Mann (get it) in the corner to back them up whenever whoever those two were guarding basically did whatever they wanted.   Rudy was fine defensively guarding perimeter players, it’s when he had to play safety by sprinting over to help from the other side of the court that he got fucked because that was just a dumb strategy Quinn never got off of."
rudy gobert is better than your favorite team USA player.
they're symptoms of Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert
Even our B team should beat a team who’s two best players are Rudy gobert and Evan Fournier
Losing against a frontcourt of Vincent Poirier and Rudy Gobert is inexcusable
Rudy gobert was DPOY…
Nic Batum and Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier just beat us today…  One guy on their team (Gobert) would make team USA
rudy gobert without 3 second violation is very scary
"Offensive superstar Rudy Gobert as the third highest scorer in a game featuring Durant, Lillard, Tatum, Lavine, Middleton and Booker. Just as expected."
"Ordinary FIBA Mills statline. I honestly see no reason why he can't have a Rudy Gobert type role on a high tier playoff team, only thing is Pop holding him back with the Spurs system."
"I know everyone did the memes and decided Rudy Gobert is not good, but... It's Rudy Gobert and there's no defensive 3 second violation. What do you think is gonna happen in the paint?"
See that thing in the middle of the paint? That's Rudy Gobert. Good luck driving against him
"I dunno man, NBA superstars Evan Fournier and Rudy Gobert looking great."
Rudy Gobert once again shut down US basketball.
Rudy Gobert outscored Kevin Durant as everyone expected.
They have 3 NBA starters on their team.  And one of their players (Rudy Gobert) is a top 25ish NBA player.  And arguably the 3rd best Center in the league.
This US team is making Rudy Gobert look good
"Yes! This kid is 17 years old, 7'2"" (still growing) and has a 7'10"" wingspan!!! And he has handles/can shoot from the outside! He's already an inch taller and has an inch longer than wingspan than Rudy Gobert! Not sure why this kid isn't the consensus pick for this question"
"LMAO I love when he is just like ""there is a picture of....Rudy Gobert. And there is JaVale McGee""  LIKE WE HAVE EYES DUDE"
Bro I’m high asl and the first comment I seen was a Rudy Gobert one 😭😭😭 had me confused scrolling the comments until I seen everybody saying it and the original
Rudy Windex Gobert
Why isn’t Rudy Gobert more aggressive on offense ? I swear he could average an easy 20 points a night
Vince Carter would've probably dunked over Rudy Gobert too
Finally my time to shine  - I hate the Timberwolves they are the worse organization in sports. They have continually wasted talented players careers. They will not make the playoffs or playin tournament. And i really hope KAT leaves and they move to Seattle.  - Utah Jazz are next on my shit list. These fuckers get overhyped every fucking year. And fools eat that shit up every time. I don’t think Mitchell is good enough to lead to a WCF berth. And fucking Rudy Gobert… Lol this French fuck is useless is in the playoffs. It was the dumbest shit ever that people were saying he was an MVP candidate.  - Memphis Grizzlies the Grit and Grind era Grizzlies were a terrible product to watch and I’m so happy they’re done. I don’t expectJa Morant to stay long term on this team. Because they won’t put a championship caliber team around him. Because Memphis is not FA destination.  [I’m out](https://youtu.be/zR3ZQWbap-M)
"France are the favourites because of Rudy Gobert, I got them going all the way. Interesting to see how it's gonna go today."
"Ordinary FIBA Mills statline. I honestly see no reason why he can't have a Rudy Gobert type role on a high tier playoff team, only thing is Pop holding him back with the Spurs system."
Rudy Gobert. His presence in the paint adds another level of instability/complexity that makes the overall strategy of the game more interesting.
"Rudy Gobert, David Robinson"
"Getting Rudy Gobert at #27 is pretty solid  ...wait a sec, is that why he wears that number? huh"
"I lowkey disagree it was ok, Rudy Gobert, McCollum, Olidipo when he was healthy, Otto Porter had his moments then fell off, Tim Hardaway Jr, Adams, now it's definitely one of the worst drafts in 2010s but I wouldn't say it's horrible. But the top 10 was atrocious   P.S. in 3+ years we all will be calling 2018 draft top 5 all time"
Nah you all just watched one playoff series and now have stupid recency bias lmfao. Rudy Gobert can't dribble a basketball but yeah he's way fucking better offensively than one of the best passers and transition scorers in the NBA.
"I am a big bam critic and for all his weaknesses he is not a guy who will be played off the floor in the playoffs. He shoots free throws well and is a great perimeter defender.  The two guys who got played off the floor this year are Rudy gobert who became a defense liability against a small ball line up with multiple 3 pt shooters and ben Simmons who is an offensive liability and cannot shoot three throws well enough to be in the lineup during the closing minutes of a close game.  The main question for bam is in this current league where offense reigns king, is bam the second best player on a championship team when he is currently unable to create his own shot (outside of the midrange)"
But then you couldn’t sign Rudy Gobert to a vet min and you’d probably have to cut Embiid’s minutes down.
"Unquestionably number 1. You have to factor that if a team has the number one pick they are a bad team and that Gobert took a few years to develop, so even if you pick Rudy, you're still likely to get another Top 3 pick the following draft. You get two high lottery picks for the price of one."
"Hot take. This would be a good trade for a Siakam.  But honestly an even crazier idea that would never happen.... what about for Rudy Gobert?  I feel like that sort of trade would make the Warriors amazing. The Jazz would get a young guy in Wiseman that fits Mitchell's Timeline, future picks and maybe another player like a Wiggins/Oubre."
Rudy Gobert should be on this team for sure
Rudy Gobert is unironically a much better offensive player than Ben Simmons.
you’re aware Rudy Gobert got $200M right…
True but I'm still very high on Ayton. He was picked 1st for a reason and guys like Luka and Trae were also seen very highly and went top 5 so its not hindsight  I can see 20-23 ppg at his peak with 10 rebounds and being a very good defensive post presence as well. He's also good at guarding the perimeter due to his mobility and athleticism as we saw against the same Clippers team that dismantled Rudy Gobert the previous series and he has even shown flashes of a shooting touch  He held his own against AD and Jokic. I don't see why he can't take a leap and truly become the 2nd star to the team to take over for Chris Paul and give him some rest. All these other guys like CP3 and Crowder have obviously peaked and I don't see even the other young guys like Booker and Bridges getting much better than they already are. The true X Factor left is Ayton
They also drafted both Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell... And then proceeded to trade those picks to Utah.
"Rudy didn’t necessarily get abused on defense when the clips went 5-out, but they turned him into essentially an average defender. So much of the Jazz’s cap space and philosophy was devoted to Gobert and his amazing interior defense. So the fact that Gobert - and by extension the team’s - biggest strength was so easily taken away indicates that Gobert caused the Jazz’s loss."
"**Players better than him:** Lebron, Kawhi, Giannis, KD, Curry, CP3, Booker, Mitchell, Jokic, Dame, Luka, Harden, Trae, PG13, AD, (healthy) Kyrie, Beal, Butler, Embiid, Tatum, Westbrook, KAT     **Players he is better than:** Jamal, Blake, Lowry, Porzingis, Tobias, Draymond, Collins, Van Vleet, Brooks, Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Wall, Oladipo, Sabonis, Vucevic, Shai, Lamelo Ball, etc. etc.     **Players he is more or less on the same level with:** Jaylen Brown, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Pascal Siakam, Deangelo Russell, Zach Lavine, Demar Derozan"
Rudy Gobert would become straight god-tier lol
There's a good fraction of /r/NBA posters who legitimately think Rudy Gobert is only good because tall.
"Nuggets would have:  Nikola Jokic  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Jamal Murray   Evan Fournier   With Melo, Michael Porter Jr.,  Monte Morris and Manimal in the rotation"
rudy gobert always take the blame for their playoff loses like its his fault donovan can't stay in front of his man
Yeah 3x DPOY Rudy Gobert is one of the best centres ever
For a second there I thought you meant Rudy Gay and I was like...he's not 7+.  But yeah....def true for Gobert.  Part of the reason Diesel keeps ripping on him.
"Definitely Dwight. Shaq's only(pretty reasonable) issue with Rudy Gobert  is that he's being paid like a franchise player earning more than any center in basketball history, when he's clearly not worth that"
Donovan Mitchell for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon or Rudy Gobert for Erick Green and Cash considerations
Ben Simmons for Rudy Gobert
Porzingis  for Rudy gobert    Jazz will got no defence  Mavs get no cap space flexibility in return for a defensive big man
With a trade evolution to Rudy Gobert
"I’ll never forget sitting on my couch watching Mavs vs Nuggets in March 2020 when it all fell apart. The broadcast could hardly focus on the game at hand, instead talking about Rudy Gobert and OKC. The fans weren’t engaged. The vibe was definitely off. Everyone saw Mark Cuban’s reaction to the league suspending ops and reality hit us like a ton of bricks. This was going to be a big deal. Feels like yesterday and forever ago at the same time."
2013 Redraft  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Rudy Gobert  3. CJ McCollum  4. Victor Oladipo  5. Steven Adams  6. Robert Covington  7. Otto Porter Jr.  8. KCP  9. Kelly Olynyk  10. Tim Hardaway Jr.
"1. Giannis : No need to explain why  2. Healthy victor : Otherwise, he's 5th.  3. Rudy Gobert (Have to give some love to a multi-DPOY)  4. CJ : He nice &amp; nicer than the rest.  5. Shroder : Headache at time, but still worth it compared to the rest  6. Tim Hardaway  7. KCP  8.Steven Adams  9. Otto Porter  10. Trey Burke"
"That’s kinda weird draft. Rudy gobert at 27 is a steal too. Cj at 10 is a good pick. All star selection is hard. How about...how many are even starting for a team? Or how many are even in the league? Not many, which is pretty typical. But the best players came later in the first round."
"""You don't wanna be spitting on that mic""  Rudy Gobert, probably"
The problem is that Ayton offensively is very dependent on his PG  You can't always rely on TS and efficiency stats for centers because some get fed a lot easier looks than others  Unless one thinks that Rudy Gobert is an elite offensive player
"And if Giannis scored 0 points last night they probably would have lost.  And if Ben Simmons could shoot like Steph, the Sixers probably win.  And if Rudy Gobert was swapped out for Hakeem, the Jazz probably win.  That’s the fun about made up scenarios, they can be whatever you want them to be."
More like Rudy Gobert
Rudy GoBert has entered the chat
"Giannis is a PF. Davis is a PF, or at least he likes to pretend he’s one.  It’s Embiid, Jokic and then your choice of KAT/Rudy Gobert.  Bam/Ayton are knocking on the door but aren’t there yet. Vuc/Valunciunas/Capela don’t deserve to be in a conversation with KAT. Drummond doesn’t deserve to be in a conversation with them. Dude is fucking washed."
"I was gonna go for some Rudy Gobert slander, but I remembered the Jazz don't have a fucking mutant on their team."
Ayton has really descended all the way back down to Rudy Gobert territory this series.

Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porziņģis / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Dončić / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schröder / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto

"The 2018 Jazz. Most people didn't expect us to make the playoffs after Hayward left, and we had a terrible record halfway through the season. Then Rudy Gobert returned and promised Jazz Nation that everything would be fine, and he carried us to the second round of the playoffs.  That season is why Jazz fans so adamantly defend Rudy, even more so than they defend Donovan."
rudy gobert most exciting player in the league
"my controversial take is that playing the ""what if no injuries"" game is dumb, and doubly so in cases like this where everyone chooses players, teams and timeframes to arbitrarily ignore.  Like how can you call the bubble Heat a fluke when Dragic got injured during the finals and has been struggling with injury since? Why ignore the other injuries on the Nuggets and Clippers? What if the Warriors weren't missing the 2nd-best shooter in NBA history? What if KD never even got injured? What if LeBron stayed healthy 2 seasons ago, would AD be a Laker? What if Rudy Gobert didn't have COVID? What if KP could stay healthy? What if Greg Oden was completely healthy and still played for the Blazers?  We can all tell ourselves whatever story we want that theoretically benefits our team. It's just pointless."
"Rudy Gobert, Cj McCollum, Anthony Davis.  That last one is salt. The real answer is Jayson Tatum."
"Rudy Gobert, never seen a 3x dpoty so easily fazed out in a game year after year."
Rudy gobert and kyrie
"LMFAO how can someone lack so much self-awareness. How do you call someone a casual and then say all of that? Did you re-read what you wrote?  \---  &gt;Look at Coach Nick BBALLBREAKDOWN.  Coach Nick is solid. But the fact that you're citing literally the most ""pop"" YouTube channel isn't a good start if you wanna call someone a casual.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;if you had watched the Jazz playoff  You call someone a casual and then ask if they watched the PLAYOFF GAMES? Do you not see what's wrong with that?  Everyone watches playoff games. That's how ""casuals"" are born. Try telling people who watch EVERY Utah Jazz game that Gobert is their ""liability on defense,"" and I guarantee you'll get laughed out of the room. Utah BUILDS their defense around Gobert.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;most people of the media are dumb as fuck and only watch at raw numbers like blocks or defensive rating.  That's literally the opposite of why he's DPOY. If it was about raw numbers, why is Whiteside often considered a bad defender and not DPOY material? I mean he's led the league in blocks twice, while Rudy has NEVER led in blocks.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;rim protection, which in 2021 is the single most useless skills by a bigman  This is the single dumbest thing I've heard in a long, long time. I really don't understand if you're joking or not. This is not even an opinion anymore. This is just straight up wrong. It's almost like saying three-point shooting is the most useless skill for a guard. I don't even know what to say to this.  \---  Idk. Maybe you're trolling. That seems more likely tbh now that I re-read all of that. If you are, then you win LOL. I'm quite dumbfounded."
Does Rudy Gobert kick puppies? For that matter does the Jazz? Seems like r/nba just doesn't like the Jazz players and I can't figure out why.
"Rudy Gobert is a lion, he wears his heart on his sleeve. With that said he is a fiercely loyal competitor and wants nothing more than to win for his team, his fans and his country. He is the man you hate your team to face but will make you rise to fight anyone who dare slanders his name. Respect o7"
"lmao. Team USA was like 5 points away from losing this game, so Evan wasn't wrong at all. Rudy Gobert decides not to brick every FT he shoots, and this game could be very different."

Fuck Rudy Gobert and that bull shit officiating. Guy is a wreckless fuck swinging his elbows all game and didn’t get called for one offensive foul. This would have been a blowout if it weren’t for the disgraceful officiating.
Rudy gobert an emotional man
Rudy gobert fucks things up again. Hopefully the gold medal motivates dame to want a chip more

Did the French coach forget that he had Rudy Fucking Gobert on the bench??
How do you not have Rudy Gobert in
Rudy Gobert is the only dude in a FIBA game getting calls like it's the NBA
I forgot how much I disliked Rudy “patient zero” Gobert
"of all the things bam adebayo can handle, rudy gobert is not one"
I’m convinced the refs are blood relatives of Rudy Gobert
omfg how are we letting rudy fucking gobert be the number 1 option on offense lmfao
The one on gobert he didn’t get fouled in the first place. The shot clock was weird but I chalked that up to a weird fiba rule. De colo clearly pushed off. That Fournier “foul” would have the entire French team fouled out.  Jrue holiday has 2 fouls on absolutely nothing. Tatum blocked Rudy cleanly and they called a foul. KD got clotheslined with no call and then 7 seconds later we got a foul call for 0 contact
It's way closer than it should be because Rudy Gobert is tearing Pop's team a new asshole.
Sample size? One team is full of NBA superstars and the other team has Rudy Gobert.
Meanwhile Rudy Gobert is tearing Pop's team a new asshole.
USA v Rudy Gobert  just like it always was meant to be  LETS FUCKING GO FRANCE
There's a reason that traditional bigs don't fit in the NBA anymore. Same reason that gobert got played off the floor in the playoffs. Put Rudy in a pnr every possession and make him defend KD. He can't
"Can we finally stop the narrative that you can get quality centers for absolutely nothing?   Granted, JaVale McGee didn’t sign for a ton of money with Phoenix but at the end of the day if you’re looking to be a contender you’ll most likely need a competent center rotation.   You can obviously get guys for close to the vet min that can soak up regular season minutes but those guys are obviously going to be exploited hard in the postseason to the point where you better have a backup plan.   So Phoenix coughed up more than a vet min for McGee and while Utah got Whiteside for a vet min, they also signed Rudy Gay who you’d hope can work as a small-ball 5 if Gobert gets played off the floor"
U guys blind af  They are switching everytime on Gobert. He either has Durant on him or a pg on the switch. Theres no way they can guard him without fouling on the block.   If the refs dont call the foul and he misses 1/2. Its an easy 2 points for Rudy.   You guys really defending NBA reffing just because of all the headlines comparing FIBA vs NBA refs this week?
if the united states could hit a 3 maybe they wouldnt have to worry about rudy gobert free throws
rudy gobert is dominant   allez france  allez rudy  destroy them

Rudy Gobert is pretty good at basketball
Bro I despise Rudy Gobert.
Can’t decide if I want Jrue &amp; Khris to win Gold or Rudy Gobert so this sub can have a meltdown.
Durant v Gobert?  Rudy about to grab 20 boards yo
Who’s gonna stop KD…?  It’s Rudy gobert not jokic lmfao
Rudy Gobert grabs rebounds against us the way Britney Griner grabs rebounds against every country the women’s team has faced lol
if this team lets Rudy Gobert win a gold medal we should never be allowed to send another basketball team to the olympics

"Dwight averaged 26/14 with 3 blocks against Portland in 2014.  He was also extremely good next year, not as good as 14. But like a better version of Rudy Gobert in the 2015 playoffs.  CP3 and Russ were also top level players with Harden. Prime has different definitions to different people. But Russ is still in his prime to me... he's just not at his peak.  CP3 was also elite in 2018, not so much 2019. I don't really get the heavy questioning about this statement. They were all really good. It's not like they were washed up shells of themselves. CP and Russ just got injured in the playoffs.  These teams also just got beat by better teams. Happens all the time in NBA history. Not that big of a deal."
Rudy Gobert spent most of his rookie year in the D League.   Sometimes it takes a bit for young guys to figure it out.   You can both rate a draft pick and also understand that you can’t expect a 18-19 year old big to be able to adapt instantly to the NBA.   Who is the last center to jump into the league and make a massive impact from Day 1?  Yao? Dwight? Give your youngsters some time.
"It does feel odd seeing an entire soap opera be created around two dudes who are just highly trusted nominated spokesmen. They do a fantastic job, but it's not like they're deep under cover infiltrating NBA organisations to expose corruption or something.  If it ever comes out that Woj has actually been Rudy Gobert this whole time, using prosthetics to lead the league in blocks while investigating fraud in the Jazz front office, *then* I'll join this sub in idolising them."
"Yeah there weren't even three pointers back then which obviously makes things way easier for someone with his player profile  If you put Rudy Gobert in that era he'd be a top 3 player in the league along with Russell himself and Wilt(how do you beat him without the three ball?), it doesn't make Rudy a top 10 all time player lol"
"Oh I don't disagree that they're asking for too much for Simmons but people tend to over rate what dame is also. If the relationship could be repaired the sixers best chance at winning is Simmons because they can't get anyone back for him that equates to him. Everyone is just going to be a better scorer and they're going to lack in the intangibles and defense that he brings. Plus it's going to make them match up terribly with the two teams they need to be able to beat the most in the bucks and nets. From all reports though it doesn't seem like the relationship is reparable and they'll get a kawhi to the spurs or George to the thunder ( this would be about the best they could get) kind of trade. I'm back and forth on whether he's got a bad contract, certainly he does if you're needing him to score but if you slot him into the elite defender category and has the game to get you 15 and 7 and 7 there are certainly teams that could use that. Gobert is making more every year and idk if Simmons is any less useful than Rudy is. I think the main issue is the expectations the sixers have that Simmons is going to get you twenty a night, couple that with his complete collapse in this year's playoffs and this is the result. A devalued player in part because expectations were far too high for him.     My thoughts on Dame are he's an elite scorer who can't get past the first round most years. Mainly because of his team but harden and others have managed to show that they can get the team over a few more humps than Lillard can. Plus Lillard is 31, he's got a few years left at being the elite player he is, if that. So you can't really trade the bank for him either. The blazers held on to him a year or two too long if they wanted max value back for him."

Not even close. He’s not even able to sign a contract richer than Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert:  If you count screen assists he had a triple double!
"&gt;Gobert having a good regular season   lol. 3 DPOYS. Multiple All NBA teams. He’s way better and more impactful in the regular season than DeMar ever was. The original comment is mostly right. The players aren’t analysts. Say what you want about hot takes and bad opinions but the players routinely have worse takes and it shows when players vote on things.  If the players are wowed by DeMar and just ignore Rudy because he doesn’t score, then it proves the original comment’s point about how the players only care about a dude’s bag."
"Nah. Simmons might be a good defender, but he can't do what Gobert does. He doesn't have the same monstrous length or godlike defensive instincts in the PnR, he's not the same lob threat that Gobert is, and he also is way less durable than Gobert. An underrated thing about Rudy is that he's a true seven-footer, but he's only really had *one or two* real injuries in his entire career. Simmons missed his first season, then has had intermittent back issues the last two seasons that have caused him to miss close to 35 games. Gobert has missed maybe 5 in that timespan.   If you put Simmons at the 5 he is going to get torched on every possession playing the drop coverage that the Jazz play. He might be a little bit better in small-ball scenarios (not much, Rudy is a seriously underrated man-to-man defender, he just isn't put into that situation very often because it's not what he's best at), but Simmons is way worse in a traditional scheme."
"I’ve had Mitchell as the best player on the team since the Nuggets series in the bubble. He put on an all time performance, and Gobert got abused defensively because Jokic could shoot. I will admit that Rudy normally plays great in the regular season, but Donovan is consistently the better player when it matters, and that holds way more weight imo."
Can we get some numbers on the superstar center Rudy Gobert /s
"""what would you value this imaginary player I made up in my head""  What if Steph was 6'8""?  What if Ben Simmons shot 75% from half court?   What if Rudy Gobert had the skillet to play point guard?"
"So do you not think prime Kawhi would be the best defender in any era? You think Simmons would struggle defensively in the 80s or 90s? You think Rudy Gobert wouldn't be able to play defense in that era? You think Ty Lue is a better defender than any of them? Lmao you need to take your dementia meds, my guy"
"Being good at defense is the most sought after trait in modern NBA lmao. You're just regurgitating old-head rhetoric with nothing to back it up.   As a defender you have to be able to navigate the rules that are stacked against you and still get the stop. Unless you're literally a top 10 offensive talent in the league, you cannot break most teams' rotation without being at least good on defense.   Meanwhile you have guys like Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert who have almost no offensive talent but still get minutes because they're elite defenders.  If you haven't watched NBA in 20 years you can just say that lol"
"[Charania] The Utah Jazz have agreed to trade Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert and 4 first round draft picks to the Philadelphia 76ers for Ben Simmons, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium."
"No the mistake was that we got 3 techincal fouls 3 games in a row. Last 2 games we won, now rudy gobert goaltending and the technical later basically cost us the game"
"The Jazz players hike a lot, especially Rudy Gobert. He’s always posting pictures of different hikes he does but yea the winter sports are a bit too dangerous for a professional basketball player that relies on keeping their body in perfect condition. The golf scene here is extremely underrated though. It’s pretty cheap to golf and there is some awesome courses in the mountains with incredible views and fun elevation changes"
Rudy Gobert has clips of him draining 3s. But if he ever made one in a game it would be a miracle.
"French Canadian here so my translation of this (heavily) accented French announcer may not be perfect but here goes:   **00:18:** Luca Doncic with the rebound who has the game in his hands. If he scores, Slovenia wins the game    **00:10:** 90-89 with ten seconds left. Luca Doncic will take the shot, it's clear!     **00:05:** Luca Doncic facing Rudy Gobert    **00:04:** Doncic to Prepelicccccc...  **00:01:** BLOCKED!!! BATUM! BLOCKED!!  **00:00:** We won! We won with that block from Batum, France has won! We're in the finals! We're in the finals with a score of 90 to 89! Incredible end of the game! Incredible block by Batum, the captain! He blocked Prepelic! France is in the Olympic final to face the USA! Huge ending! Huge ending!     **&lt;colour commentator&gt;:** France has won this game by the quality of its offense but also its defence. What a great defensive play by Nicolas Batum! I'm drinking Slovenia's tears tonight with my wine"
"Ben Simmons was first in the ranking, slightly higher than Rudy Gobert."
"Rudy Gobert size 20, 258 lbs. .0775  Bonus: Donovan Mitchell, 215lbs, 17 shoe size. .079"
You’ll regret this comment when Rudy Gobert wins MVP next season.
"He just had a bad game, the French were playing amazing D on him, he literally never had a chance to rest with all the pressure they put on him, fullcourt the entire game. Missed a few shots he normally takes, then seemed to tweak his wrist. He didn't shoot well but still got his teammate's shots and racked up assists. Major props to Batum, plus Gobert bothered him a lot when he got near the basket. There were a few times where he could have had a good look, but Rudy made it impossible to get a clean look."
Rudy Gobert is the textbook example of a traditional C as well
"It’s kinda hard to say if that alone makes him a lock though. I mean, it’s obvious that just winning multiple DPOYs isn’t enough to make someone a lock or else Mark Eaton would be in.  In all, there are 6 players with multiple DPOYs who are in the Hall, but all of them have more on their resumes in addition to those DPOYs than Gobert has at this point.  Sidney Moncrief won 2, but he made 5 All-Star teams and 5 All-NBA (4 Second Team, 1 First, compared to 3 Thirds and a Second for Gobert), and still, it took more than 20 years for him to get in.  Dennis Rodman has 2 and is beat by Gobert on the All-NBA front, but he also won 5 championships, including one of the greatest title runs in history.  Hakeem won 2 but was also an MVP and two-time Finals MVP, so really no comparison for Gobert.   Alonzo Mourning won 2, but he made 7 All-Stars and was a much more polished offensive player than Gobert, averaging 19+ points per game 8 times during his career. Plus, he won a championship as a role player late in his career.  Ben Wallace won 4, so he has 1 more than Gobert, plus he won a championship.  The best comparison may be Dikembe Mutombo, but even he has Gobert beat in longevity (4 DPOYs vs. 3, 8 All-Stars vs. 2), and he was the second-best player on a team that made the Finals.  So while it’s true that, to this point, almost everyone with multiple DPOYs has been inducted, it’s worth noting that those players were all more well-rounded and/or had more postseason success than Rudy has had. He’ll certainly get in if he keeps it up for a couple more years, but if you actually look at the previous voting results, it’s a bit premature to label him a lock at this point."
"I mean, it’s kinda hard to tell how much those DPOYs matter. Theres not really a good historical comparison with Gobert’s resume to assess if it’s HOF-worthy.  Mark Eaton won 2 DPOYs and never made it. Alonzo Mourning, Sidney Moncrief, and Dennis Rodman won 2 and are in, but they all had more well-rounded games and/or more postseason success than Gobert. Ben Wallace and Mutombo both have 4 and are in. They may be the best comparisons for Rudy, Dikembe had a longer stretch of success than Rudy has had so far, and Ben won a championship.  So it’s possible those DPOYs will be seen as a guaranteed ticket to the voting committee, but there’s really no way for us to know that at this point."
"&gt;. Was Tony Allen just being lazy? Draymond Green? Rudy Gobert?  Did the rest of their game regress? Is their lack of shooting just killing their teams offensive schemes? Can defences set up entirely around the fact they can't shoot? No, no and no.  &gt;Demar Derozan has been trying and falling to improve his 3 pt shooting   Lmfao please dont talk to me about Demar. He came into the league as a high flyer AND THAT IS IT. If you bothered to look, at all, you would see he improved his shooting AND was working on his 3 before we traded him.   &gt;If it was as easy as just deciding to be a better shooter, half the league would be Steph Curry clones. It's not.  So you're either Simmons bad or Curry good. It's not possible be anywhere in between. Got it."
He’s always struggled (by his standards) against Rudy fwiw. Gobert takes away a lot of his drive and kick game.
"Yeah some guys have improved their shooting, but there are tons of examples of high character guys who couldn't. Was Tony Allen just being lazy? Draymond Green? Rudy Gobert? Demar Derozan has been trying and failing to improve his 3 pt shooting for his whole career, is he a slacker too?  If it was as easy as just deciding to be a better shooter, half the league would be Steph Curry clones. It's not."
Also he was scared of getting blocked by Rudy Gobert. He got some good looks for layups but he went for the pass instead.
"Don't get me wrong, that was a great block by Batum. But that was Rudy Gobert's defense that put him in that position. Everyone makes fun of Gobert and acts like he can't defend the perimeter, but he closed up the driving lane for Luka and forced him to pass by staying right up on him. Luka would normally shoot a step back but had no space with Gobert shielding him. Just getting the ball out of Luka's hands was probably the main goal defensively by France on that possession. Great team defense all around"
"Lue deserves a ton of credit for how he matched up. And your last point is the most accurate statement, Gobert needs to make them pay for putting a smaller guy on him. Rudy is a good offensive player, but if he can't expose a 6'8 SF, then there's going to be issues.  Again, Gobert is a drop center because he has to be. You want him in the paint and the Jazz need him there because their perimeter defenders are meh. The Jazz needed to switch something up, but taking Gobert off (not saying you said that, but that's what a lot of people said) was not the answer. He wasn't played off the floor."
"What kinda narrative are you tryng to push here? How is Gobert gonna foul him when Luka ran into him and Rudy had the ball? Hes tryng to say HE fouled Gobert, not the other way."
"I’m not even hating on Rudy, for a guy who’s 7’2 yea he switches well. I’m not anti drop coverage either, the Jazz play really good basketball and he’s their best player. It’s just really hard for taller players to contain smaller players with a center of gravity closer to the floor. You can survive switching with a big like Gobert but the clippers had 4 6’7-6-9 guys who could all put the ball on the floor and attack, that’s rare. Unfortunately Gobert isn’t a polished enough scorer to make them really pay.   I like Gobert and the Jazz though they could’ve easily have went to the finals this year. He’s a drop center though."
Rudy Gobert
FIBA Rudy Gobert scares opponents even more than in the NBA. Luka didnt even attacked the paint today and look scared
Gobert had two of the most solid blocks I've ever seen. Both were guys who seemed they were deliberately hunting Rudy to dunk on him
"Rudy ""LeBron James"" Gobert"
"Rudy ""Screen Assist"" Gobert"
"Guys who are still making more than Randle after this extension:  DeAngelo Russel, Kevin Love, Porzingis, Andrew Wiggins, John Wall, Jrue Holiday, Rudy Gobert"
"Looks like France is pulling away, that Rudy Gobert defense though."
"Rudy ""hip check"" Gobert"
"&gt; He would be Rudy Gobert but not as helpless on switches  Why does this incorrect thought still get posted regularly? Gobert is a great at switching when he's asked to do it. The Jazz's scheme (because they have weak perimeter defenders) it for Gobert to stay in drop coverage (which he is incredible at). But when Gobert does switch, the stats and eye test back it up. People just bring up one clip of Steph Curry a few years and think that's how it always is."
"Did Rudy Gobert just do a back down dunk? lol, I better see that in the nba next year"
"&gt;Rudy Gobert is the most impactful defender, specifically in the regular season, in NBA history.  That's just disrespectful to Bill Russell man."
"Rudy Gobert is the most impactful defender, specifically in the regular season, in NBA history.      His On-Off splits are otherworldly and there's no other player that makes the difference he does to opposition shot selection. Just look at how many layups and high percentage shots teams attempt when he's on the bench compared to on the court.      He completely transforms the game on that end more than any other player ever has and he'll get appreciated for it more once he retires."
"I’d have the A+ rim protector with the B+ perimeter guy.  Look at how Atlanta, who had some of the worst personnel when it comes to perimeter D was able to be a good defense because of Capela.   People say Rudy Gobert got ‘exposed’ against the Clippers and I understand why. He was guarding Terrence Mann after the Clips went 5 out. End of the day, he’s there to protect the rim. Watch all those Clippers buckets. It’s drive and kick. Teams will live with a guy like Mann beating them over Paul George going for 40. Terrence Mann had his day, so Gobert will be remembered as the scapegoat.  Don’t let it take away from Utah being one of the best defensive teams in the league, to being one of the worst when he’s off the floor though. Why? They can’t defend the perimeter and they have no interior presence with him out. How many times did George or Jackson blow by their man?   By contrast, a weaker interior defender lwill always get picked on in the playoffs. They are defending the spot all players want to get to."
I would say he's not even top 10 he's close though  No particular order   Paul George  Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant  Lebron  Russ  Pat Bev  Ben Simmons  James Harden  Kyrie(maybe? not 100% on this one)  Draymond  Chris Paul      Honorable Mentions    Kelly Olynyk  Rudy Gobert  Grayson Allen  Devin Booker  Kyle Kuzma
I think Hakeem and David Robison where rim protectors(more like Rudy gobert) not help side defenders. And tbh idk it’s really hard to gage help side defenders imo. Giannis is obviously a good defender but idk how I’m supposed to judge what you are asking sorry.
"I don't agree that an Olympic carry job could put a player over another player all-time, especially at the tier of rankings where KD sits. If he was beating teams with multiple all-stars (like he has the potential to do in the NBA) it would be one thing, but the gold medal game was against a team whose two best players were Rudy Gobert, the DPOY... and Evan Fournier.  No disrespect to Evan Fournier, but him and Gobert are not a standard by which I'm ready to have an all-timer ready to jump another all-timer.  The Olympics are just too different from the NBA and the talent levels on the teams aren't good enough - they just have insane chemistry under rules that encourage different playstyles.  I'll entertain your premise though - who did KD jump because of his Olympic performance that he had not already surpassed based on his NBA career?"
Nobody gives a shit when you’re also working part-time making Trae Young look like Rudy Gobert defending the rim and making Shaq look like Steph Curry at the FT line.
"I think they have a shot if Lebron, AD, KD, harden, Kyrie, Steph, dame, luka, Giannis, Trae young, Middleton, jimmy butler, jokic, Rudy gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Tatum, Julius randle, Devin booker, Chris Paul, Paul George, embiid and ja Morant suffer season ending injuries"
Ben Simmons once scored 42 points with Rudy Gobert guarding him
"that don't mean anything  he wasn't held in high high regard  he wasn't KLAY until they won  he wasn't a top 2 shooter of all-time til we saw him smack the thunder silly  draymond is a defensive guy, that doesn't make a superteam  that's like ben wallace/rudy gobert being your third star making your team a superteam  don't work like that"
"While Donovan Mitchell is not better at what he does than Rudy Gobert is, Donovan Mitchell, in today’s NBA, is a more valuable player."
*Team Cancer*  **PG** * Damian Lillard * Ben Simmons  **SG** * Bradley Beal * Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **SF** * Kawhi Leonard * OG Anunoby  **PF** * Bam Adebayo * MPJ  **C** * Rudy Gobert * Steven Adams  **Reserves** * Patrick Beverley * Danny Green
"1. I replaced Harden with Curry in your argument to demonstrate how stupid your original take was.  2. I was drawing comparisons between your argument and [this meme format.](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1330819-we-should-improve-society-somewhat)  I guess you are too dense to understand that.  The narrative that there's ""weak defense"" in the modern NBA is just dumb and old heads like you really need to stop with it. Just because you're not allowed to grab and shove players and call it ""defense"" doesn't mean that there is none. It just requires more nuance and timing.   Sure, after the hand-check was removed, there was an increase in scoring. But a rule change shouldn't affect your ability to play defense unless you were bad at it to begin with. If the NBA removed the gather step rule, guys like Harden and Luka would just find the next thing to give them an edge. Just like how guys like Rudy Gobert or Draymond Green can flourish defensively despite these rules that supposedly make scoring so much easier.  And high scoring numbers is not indicative of no defense anyway. That completely ignores the impact that pace (faster game = more shot attempts) and the three pointer (more points + more skilled shooters) have on those numbers.   Just for fun though, here's the average field goal percentages from each decade:  1980-1989: 48.5 percent  1990-1999: 46.3 percent  2000-2009: 44.9 percent   2010-2020: 45.5 percent"
Rudy Gobert? I'm sorry but Gobert is not better than Kyrie. Neither is Beal. Luka and Taytum are too young and don't have the accolades to back it up yet.   I mean come on. We're talking about an NBA champion here. This sub's hate for Kyrie is just absurd.  Also. Rudy Gobert? You and Kyrie must have the same dealer.
"Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, and Rudy Gobert come to mind."
Oh this portland thing isnt lasting beyond next year only so much more false hope they can pretend to sell Dame on.  Donovan Mitchell gonna get tired of Rudy Gobert again at some point
"Lilliard, Luka, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Brad Beal, Rudy Gobert.  Kyrie’s game is visually stunning, but I dock him for consistently and repeatedly missing games every season. Being able to be on the court and help your team is a pretty important factor in your overall value."
Rudy Gobert shooting 40% from 3 would be pretty cool to see.
"It'll never happen, but trading Kyrie for, let's say, Rudy Gobert, would improve the Nets and make them more balanced."
2011 - fareid to mirotic  2012 - Evan Fournier to sullinger  2013 - Rudy Gobert to livio jean charles  2014 doug McDermott to Dario saric  2015 - mudiay to Stanley Johnson
Rudy Gobert influenced me into reading One Piece and it's pretty good.
"&gt;Y’all are about to give Ayton the literal same contract lmao great value Rudy Gobert   Didn't you watch Ayton literally chew up your Nuggets and spit them back out? If you think Ayton is just a great value Rudy Gobert then I'm convinced you don't even watch highlights.  Let's get this clear: Gobert is likely a better rim protector than Ayton will ever be. But Ayton is still a borderline elite rim protector (as seen in the WCSF). But in addition, he's a great perimeter defender for a big (look up his playoff perimeter defense stats, I can find them for you if you want), he's an elite rebounder, he has extremely soft touch around the rim, he is one of the best PNR bigs in the game, he has a great midrange jumper, and he's a lob threat. His only weakness is creating his own shot but that's not necessary at this moment in time with CP3, Book, and Payne.  So, in short, Ayton is a winning player and can do just about everything. MPJ can shoot. And even though he's elite at that, he can be a black hole on offense when he tries to handle the ball, he can't defend a guard to save his life (have fun watching that in the playoffs from here on out), and who seriously knows how his back will hold up.  Not even comparable players, Ayton is so much better right now."
"Y’all are about to give Ayton the literal same contract lmao great value Rudy Gobert   Just think, we’re going to look back on the 2021 playoffs in April and say “damn, the suns really just played injured teams last year lol”"
To come up with a counter example you had to use the classic braindead counter of using a below the rim bigman. If someone is using TS to compare to why Steph Curry is a elite scorer between him and another PG and then someone else randomly barges in and states Rudy Gobert is better. Besides I never said TS was the only thing that is important. What you have done is something called [strawman fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman).
Rudy Gobert
"&gt; He averaged 17 a game in the playoffs, 80% of 17 is 13.6. Excuse me, it is way, way, way easier to find a 13.6 ppg spot up shooter than it is someone that can bring 80% of what Ayton does on defense      Its funny because even when you use a super small sample size to make that statistical argument there still aren't forwards who give you 80% of Porter's production on similar efficiency.       Also you're overestimating Aytons defense, you act like he's Gobert or something.     &gt;  and that’s not even taking into account that Ayton averaged 1 less ppg on better efficiency in the playoffs      You're not taking into account how important spacing is. We see year after year some random low usage lob catching big lead the league in field goal percentage, its not the accomplishment you think it is. No one considers Rudy Gobert, Clint Capela, or Jarrett Allen to be great offensive players. That's just what happens when you take most of your shots in the paint as a roll man."
"That’s Rudy Gobert money, which everyone clowned on him for"
"**Should be locks:**   Paul George  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Trae Young  Karl-Anthony Towns  **I Would Take:**  Chris Paul   Rudy Gobert  Bradley Beal   &amp;#x200B;  Zion, Mitchell, Booker, Lavine all have strong arguments over those 3 at the end. I think Middleton, Bam, and Westbrook are comfortably the bottom 3 for me. They are great players, but I wouldn't actually want any of those guys as my best player if I'm trying to make the playoffs - and with Bam and Westbrook they have definite flaws that can be exploited."
"Rudy gay is not going to lead the jazz to a title lmao. The lakers and nets will smack them. The bucks will smack them. They lost to the clippers without kawhi, the jazz arent going anywhere, especially as long as rudy gobert is worthless on offense."
Is Rudy Gobert a bad player
"&gt; don't need an offensive liability  This is where there's a big misunderstanding. It's up there with Rudy Gobert getting played off the floor takes. His free throw shooting was liability in the playoffs this year, but overall, he's still a net positive on offense. He could/should do more, but he doesn't actively hurt a team."

Why did I read Rudy Gay as Rudy Gobert 🤔🤔🤔
"I think so. People constantly bring up that he was #2 in DPOY voting but what does that matter? I'd rather have Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, or AD on defense instead of him. Ben Simmons is obviously a great defender but he is not a top 5 defender."
"Yes. Ben Simmons, like Rudy Gobert, only excels on defense when they play lottery bound teams who aren't really trying to win and trot out rookies who are just finding their way in the league.     When they play other playoff caliber teams, regular season or playoffs, the results are often tragic."
"Basically if he was a perfectly healthy human he could probably be a Rudy gobert. But he isn’t so he won’t be. Which sucks, because that kid can man up to any big in the league. But he can only do it for like 24min a game max so far. We’ll see this season. If he can actually net like 28min avg and play to what he has, he’s an awesome big man."
"Could Shaq crash the modern game party though?  Teams have gone small, but part of small ball's effectiveness is because centers are unable to make their undersized defenders pay inside. Rudy Gobert is a prime example of this."
Rudy Gobert led the league in dunks last year...
Not for the Jazz. Expecting them to win a championship with Rudy Gobert as one of your max contracts doesn't really have anything to do with the coach
Rudy Gobert
"Listening to nephews talk about wilt is the funniest thing in the world. Wilt is a taller, faster, stronger, more athletic and skilled Giannis.   Wilt in today’s era would destroy the league in ways you can’t even imagine. A center that can outrun, out muscle, out jump and  easily score on every single center in the league with ease would be insane. You could run a small ball lineup of all shooters and wilt and he would anchor the paint while running Jokic/embiid/Davis/Giannis/gobert off the floor. There isn’t a single center in today’s league who could match wilts size and speed. He would be Rudy gobert and Giannis on defense and he’d be a better version of Giannis and embiid on offense."
Everything said about Ben Simmons can equally be said about Rudy Gobert. But if Snyder and Donovan Mitchell came out and said “yeah we can’t win with Gobert” Gobert would be well within reason to say fuck that and leave the team.
"Yea I would love to see how much higher (or how close) Dame is compared to the other guys Ben considered/mentioned for the 10th spot on the ""Factoring in Health"" list (Paul George, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, &amp; Jayson Tatum)"
"Eh, there’s a pretty big difference between shooting 45% from the field and 65%. Rudy isn’t a floor raiser offensively but he’s far from the absolute deadweight that Eaton was. We’ve shown the last couple years you can have an elite offense with Gobert at center. That was definitely not true of Eaton.   Having watched Eaton is one of the reasons at chuckle at people who say Rudy us no offensive game. I watched Stockton and Malone try to win rings with Ostertag and Eaton at center. I know what a center with no offense looks like."
BILL RUSSELL IS NOT A TOP 10 PLAYER ALL TIME. HE HAS A GREAT RÉSUMÉ BUT WOULD BE EQUIVALENT OR WORSE THAN RUDY GOBERT IN TODAYS GAME.
That isn’t what I said at all. I literally said Gobert is the better player but not by much.  But Ayton  is far more skilled and will be the better player sooner rather than later. As I said Ayton at 23 can already do things that Gobert cant and will never be able to do on both sides of the ball. All that separated them is experience and consistency.   Also ayton has never averaged 12 ppg per game. You must be thinking of Rudy who averages 12 for his career. His worst scoring season was last year and that’s because he sacrificed solo stats for team success. He averaged 18 on 54% shooting two seasons ago and 14 on 62% last season. So if he was to chase stats he could super easily be averaging 20+ Ppg on over 50% shooting. Something Rudy could NEVER do.   So at 6 years younger Ayton has performed better defensively against a MVP center than Gobert has in his prime and he’s far outclassed him offensively.  And you said you’d bet everything that Ayton won’t be better in the future? That’s trippin bra

"2018 and 2019 nobody in their right minds denied. He was not good. I still hold his performance better than PG though, who straight up checked out 2018 (and was injured 2019, not his fault there). 2018 was also hampered by Utah just abusing melo every single time, and was a terrible matchup due to the presence of Rudy Gobert.   2020 he was recovering from a quad injury and covid, and you're asking him to shoot, literally the opposite of why you get him. When he was healthy, he attacked a 4 v 3 and created incredible opportunities, sparking a crazy run just before the pandemic. Even with his limited performance, he had some good plays against OKC and at least tried against the Lakers, while it looked like Harden gave up.  2021, he underperformed, but he also carried them into the playoffs with some all time performances (like his games against Indiana) and was gassed by the end. He was also excellent for developing Rui and Gafford.   You're putting him on the same level as Luka, Jokic and Tatum though, which goes to show how relevant your comment is anyway. There's strawmanning and then there's what Russ haters do. Nobody says he's on the same level. He's on the tail end of his prime. This is undisputed. Is he still a top 25 player though? I think so, but certainly disputable. He has clear strengths and weaknesses."
"I see Rudy Gobert as a liability in key playoff games, he's almost unplayable at times. He's a good player, great defender, but I just have no idea why anyone would build a franchise around Rudy Gobert instead of guys like Zion or Zach Lavine.   &gt; Rudy's arguably the most important player on a team that had the point differential of a 74 win team  This kinda cherry picked nonsense is boring, they didn't win 74 games even if they had the ""point differential of one"", they definitely didn't play like one. And no, Mitchell is very obviously their best player, he has to save their ass every time in the playoffs and whatever he does still isn't enough as they get eliminated."
"Because he has a more outsized impact on a game than those guys do. Rudy has anchored a consistent playoff team for the last five straight years and has been a top-10 regular season player. You can say he's worse in the playoffs (i think it's overblown and usually there are other points of failure that he's taken undue amounts of responsibility for), but when you're the most impactful defensive player in basketball and your team is always great, that's typically a sign that you're a good player.   Rudy's arguably the most important player on a team that had the point differential of a 74 win team. Zion, Jrue, and Zach all failed to be the man on even an 8th seeded playoff team.   Zion, granted, is still very early in his career, and he's suffered some injury issues, but i think that's even more reason to put Gobert above him. Would you rather have 40 great offensive regular season games from one player, or a whole season of historically impactful defensive impact from another?"
The Rudy gobert situation
Jobs over life. Millions of people dying in about a year and he chose to side with people who refuse to take part in keeping this virus spread more. He's the VP of NBAPA how can you pick this side after what happen to Rudy Gobert and KAT? Well You want to be voice of the voiceless? Well the real voiceless are the dead people  This person pseudo intelligence is keep making me sick
"I have no idea why anyone would rank Rudy Gobert over guys like Zion, Jrue Holiday, Zach Lavine, etc."
"I think this was the game where the Jazz invited the 1997 Western Conference Champion team for the 20th anniversary. We played like utter crap in the first half, but Rudy made sure not to embarrass us in front of our esteemed guests.  The other thing I remember was that Jazz Nation after that game was largely in agreement that Gobert was our best player, not Hayward."
"In his last 6 career games against Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gobert has averaged 24ppg on 51/66 shooting (77%) from the field.         He absolutely dominates that matchup (Zingis is 19ppg on 41%) and it's why I was really hoping the Mavs had closed out the series against LAC because it would have given us an easier Playoff path.        One of Gobert's best games last season was a 29/20/3/3/3 performance against Dallas while Mitchell was out with injury."
"https://www.deseret.com/sports/2020/12/22/22193242/utah-jazz-rudy-gobert-contract-extension-nba-donovan-mitchell-ryan-smith  I am trying to understand the numerical logic of not giving centers the max.  &gt; The Utah Jazz gave Rudy Gobert the third largest contract in league history and made him the highest paid center ever when they agreed to a **five-year, $205 million** contract extension Sunday ...  &gt; After being named NBA Defensive Player of the Year twice, Gobert was eligible for up to 35% of the cap (roughly **$228 million over five years**), the same amount that Giannis Antetokounmpo just signed on for in Milwaukee, but Gobert took a discount.  Let me get this straight.  Saving $23 million over 5 years for a $200+ million contract is going to get the Jazz more wins exactly how?  &gt; Looking toward the future, the discounted price that Gobert agreed to does give the Jazz a little bit of flexibility, but it still means the Jazz will more than likely be a luxury tax-paying team once Gobert and Donovan Mitchell’s extensions kick in next season.  Is the argument that saving about $4 million a year going to help the Jazz get under the luxury tax threshold some year so they can reset it and avoid some sort of repeater tax?  I don't know.  It seems to me it is important to not give the max just as a pride thing for a team to say it didn't give the max."
"Yes. This is the right move. I think KD, LeBron, Giannis, Jokic, Paul George, Rudy Gobert, and Chris Paul should follow Kyrie's example. Then the teams should follow the Nets' example. But just those guys and teams."
Rudy Gobert cant post up Terrance Mann consistently. Literally every team can play 5 out against them if they are allowed to be that small
"&gt; Which opposing stars do you think Rudy Gobert is slowing down?  I'm going to reverse this question and spin it back to you.   With the injuries to Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard taking the Nuggets and Clippers out of play, who exactly do you think is taking advantage of Gobert in the Western Conference with a 5-out offense that is as proficient as either the Nuggets or Clippers offenses were?   Please list me the teams in the West that you think can play Gobert off the floor, I'm all ears."
"I mean you are more or less furthering my point. Giannis maybe wasnt a top 5 player then until he reached that level or the other plays around him got injured. Thats not the case with the Jazz.   Aint nobody scarred of the Jazz defensively which is their supermax calling card outside of Mitchell and Clarkson chucking 3s and praying they go in. Which opposing stars do you think  Rudy Gobert is slowing down? You really think Rudy Gay is stopping anyone?  They might fluke out and all the other contenders get injured. I mean, that's something I suppose"
I'll contest your point about RAPTOR favoring high volume scorers  That's the stat that has Rudy Gobert as the 2nd or 3rd best player in the league lol  [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)  Gobert &gt; Curry LMAO

"O he's never going to stop trying to baptize Rudy gobert. That is, until he succeeds"
Remember when he kept trying to baptize Rudy gobert? Lol I love this kid
"You see, the problem with being a Jazz fan, and particularly one that appreciates Rudy, is he tends to bring out dumb people who say dumb things.  Rudy was not our problem offensively versus the clippers. Offense in general wasn’t the problem-we scored very efficiently throughout the whole series. The problems that we did have were largely guard related, averaging under 17 assists per game as a team (dead last in the regular season was 21.3) and with Conley out and Mitchell on a bum ankle for the games we did lose we had nobody that was an actual drive threat to punish the clippers lack of rim protection.   Obviously it’d be great if Gobert had Joel Embiid’s post game, but how is that relevant when comparing him to Green? Would Draymond have been able to single handedly punish the clippers for playing small ball? Also the notion that Rudy’s efficiency is a regular season mirage is just dumb- he shot 69.4% against the clips.   Draymonds shooting isn’t really a plus. He can’t shoot well enough to actually force the defense to guard him, and he’s such a poor shooter every shot he does take is a win for the defense. His playmaking is nice, but it’s not worth as much as the combined value of Rudy’s efficiency, screens, offensive rebounding, roll gravity and foul pressure.   Draymond is a great player, don’t get me wrong. But if Green were drafted to the Jazz and Rudy to the warriors, there’d be absolutely nobody who would say Green was the better player."
"Holy shit lol. As someone else already posted, how can you write so much and be so wrong. The Jazz flair honestly makes this post pathetic.   Gobert over draymond offensively? Have you tried your hardest to forget the clippers series where Rudy showed he is thoroughly incapable of punishing players much smaller than him? Draymond can create plays for others and pass much more effectively than Gobert. We already know dray can shoot better.   Your whole spiel about Gobert being the most efficient player of all time (lmfao dude, my fucking sides) is hilarious, and only reflects how the Jazz min-max in the regular season to get impressive numbers to subsequently get shut down in the playoffs. Their entire system is fucking useless when an opponent actually plans for them  Draymond is one of the greatest defenders of all time and anchored one of the greatest teams of all time. They aren’t even comparable."
Yea I watched them but you didn’t if you thought Gobert was the problem  Nah you prob just saw Mann with 39 and a clip of Rudy getting his ankles broken by Steph and blamed him for not being able to 1v5 on defense
"I think the magic. I understand teams that may struggle in the Midwest or smaller markets, but your in FLORIDA.   You got high pics and did nothing with them. You chose to pick up Markell fultz as if he can shoot after his accident. You've drafted the same position for 2 straight years. Cole Anthony rj Hampton Jalen Suggs.   I don't see any player that says wow for merchandise. It's just sad. You got all the theme parks, clubs, weather, diversity that would attract any player but can't get any notable names or look to even try to.   You have the most athletic big man with the longest wing span in nba history train that dude into a faster Rudy gobert in mo bamba. Then u got Johnathan Isaac who ppl say have the potential to be the best all-round defender. But nothing..."
"Now i love shitting on gobert as much as everyone else right cuz he got mann handled and that was beautiful to watch flair considered. Ima say rudy aint great, he aint no embiid or jokic for sure but, he is good on defense and solid on offense. It aint his fault hes the only defender worth a damn on the jazz."
Lol assuming health kyrie is far more valuable in a playoff setting   Lebron and rudy gobert wouldn’t have beat golden state in 2016
"No, but the Warriors are popular and he's been given credit for their defence so a lot of people can't separate that from Draymond.  I think Gobert is the better defender since he's among the best rim protectors in NBA history. Draymond is more versatile but rim protection is the most valuable thing on defence so I'm going with Rudy"
"If you put Draymond on the current Jazz with our cast of non-switchable defenders, we’re not going to be a top defense. Gobert is definitely easier to build a top defense around. Just having 1 super switchable defender is not as valuable as an elite rim protector.   I’d also take Rudy over Draymond offensively, but I know people here won’t agree. Gobert is the most efficient player ever (by TS% and must be a starter). Rudy’s screens and roll gravity also open up a lot of space for his teammates. This also comes down to what you consider peak Draymond to be. Yes he had one outlier shooting year but the following year he was back down to 30% and not having anyone really guard him. I don’t think considering Draymond a 39% shooter from 3 really makes too much sense. I wouldn’t want a player whose peak was only 1 year. And a Draymond that’s a 31% career 3pt shooter isn’t as good of an offensive player as Rudy.   The best argument for Draymond is that in 2016 he was a top 10 player by a lot of advanced stats. Those same stats had Rudy better than everyone besides Jokic by a decent margin last year (and also as a top 10 player for most of the previous 4 years). I really don’t think there’s a world where a team with Draymond as it’s best player gets the #1 overall seed."
"Draymond. Gobert is easily exploitable. Just ask the Clippers. While Draymond may not bring the rim protection that Rudy gives, he’s far better at everything else defensively. If you put Draymond against a 5 out defense, yea that’s where he’ll thrive. His switching and team defense are all-time levels. On-ball he’s good but not great."
"I think theres a difference between being undisciplined and being a bad perimeter defender. You also need to consider that their entire defense is about forcing shooters off the 3 and towards the paint where Gobert clobbers. The issue with the Clippers is that Gobert was never in the paint because the Clippers went small ball... which led to their playoff defensive failure of poor perimeter defense (not necessarily undisciplined, its more of a point that they have smaller guards) and their coaches failure to adjust. You can also say that Rudy not being able to take advantage of a smaller defender on offense was a large contributor to their loss. Because if he dominates on offense, the Clippers are forced to bring back in a center and their offensive plan changes."
Prime Dwight was arguably the best player in the world. Imagine Rudy gobert capable of scoring 20ppg and guard the pick and roll switch with ease. Dude was out there chasing guards and swatting everything
"well obviously im not justifying neils shitty ass decision making in trying to go for fit rather than initial talent, but to say zach is a bust in general is still too early. he was a waste of a pick for us but he could still be a very solid winning player, and be a smaller, more mobile, offensively capable rudy gobert."
"I like the lineup versatility Gay and Paschall compared to last season give them but this sort of upside necessitates a bunch of things: Their older players (Mike, Ingles, Gay...) can't regress due to ageing, Mitchell needs to continue his incremental improvement as a creator, the Nets need to implode because that's what will blow the league wide-open...  They also failed to upgrade their perimeter defense and that absolutely destroyed them against the Clippers, regardless of how many people wanted to use Gobert as a scapegoat. This is steal what I fear the most, because a team that can play 5-out with multiple ball handlers are rare but you probably will have to face one if you want to win a title. And you are not going to close with a player of Gobert's level on the bench.  That small lineup can give you an extra jolt (not that this team doesn't like to bomb 3s in transition anyway) and an opportunity for this team to play something other than Gobert pick and rolls, which is very good offense but if you spam it enough people will make you have the ball forced into Rudy and live with him trying to beat them.  I think the Jazz will be a beast of a team during the regular season and they did update themselves a bit on lessons learned from the Clippers defeat. But not enough to make them significantly more of a contender, and the Bucks did have a considerable amount of gained versatility between during the season that ended in a championship."
"Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Rudy Gobert  &amp;#x200B;  I'd put him top 6 probably after those 5, but I don't see how that's *""at the absolute worst""*."
Imagine 69ing Rudy Gobert tho.
[Rudy Gobert be like](https://www.myinstants.com/media/instants_images/akihiko-ive-been-waiting-for-this.png)
didnt mitchell need rudy gobert?
"I got laughed at in another thread for saying that Rudy Gobert is a better player than Kyrie Irving. He probably isn’t, but I don’t think it as laughable as people made it seem. I think Gobert is the most impactful defensive player in the league and does more things on offense than people give him credit for. I also just dislike Kyrie so maybe it is that"
"Because all star teams are popularity contests? And there are plenty of people that make all nba/all star teams because of defense, for example Gobert last year. Or like Ben Simmons, who averages like a 15/7/7. Marc Gasol, Joakim Noah, Draymond Green are all guys that have gotten all nba honors based off of their defense.   Guys like Thybulle and Roberson don't get on their because there are players like them that are also better on offense, i.e. Kawhi/PG13/Butler/CP3. Same reason that guys like Rudy Gay or CJ McCollum or Malcolm Brogdon aren't making it despite having 20+ppg scoring. There are players that do what they do better plus other stuff better"
"Start Ben Wallace  Bench Rudy Gobert  Cut Dwight Howard  &amp;#x200B;  It's really close, and I'm not objective, but all 3 are basically at the same level as rim protectors/help defenders, Ben was a slightly better perimeter defender than Rudy and Dwight IMO"
"I mean, it all depends on context, right?  I can say Aleksej has been a poor shooter so far in his career, and that wouldn't be incorrect.   From there we can make observations about his game, and speculate, but we can't make any concrete statements because there's just more to it than FG%.  The experience just isn't there, yet.  On the other side of the coin, Rudy Gobert only missed 1 game and has the best FG% in the league, but no one would ever consider him the best shooter in the league, right?    Context matters."
"Dwight was in running for MVP.   Wallace anchored the best defensive team of all time  Gobert     Dwight &gt; Wallace &gt; Rudy should be majority, but I’m willing to listen to someone who has Wallace starting. They don’t cut Gobert? Gtfo here"
"His offense was terrible. His game now would be a Draymond green/rudy gobert mix, someone who can’t score but can playmake, defend, catch lobs etc"
I realized he was a clown when he went on Ryen Rusillo’s pod and said this “Rudy Gobert is his MVP vote” lmaooooooooooooo
"Sure, but you have to be a really special kind of player to be able to do that. Rudy having the post game of a guy like Valanciunas wouldn’t have done much against the clippers. They had an Orating of 128 over that series-post play isn’t gonna be the answer to that level of efficiency.   Obviously it’d be nice if Gobert all of a sudden had the offensive prowess of AD at his best, but that’s a really unrealistic ask IMO. Much more realistic to hopefully have our guards healthy and able to penetrates"

"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
"Lowry has been the best player on the Raptors since he became the defacto starting point guard instead of splitting time with Calderon in his first season with us. It is inarguable then and now. DeRozan was the face of the team because he had a longer tenure thanks to being drafted by us, had the ""I got us"" tweet, after Bosh left and put up good box score, splits especially points. But if you look even slightly beneath the surface, DeRozan was actually a negative on the floor as shown by having a negative on-off for his career and every single season except one. Or that the lineup data which birthed the Lowry + Bench Mob as one of the top lineups year in year out while DeRozan+Bench Mob was so routinely terrible that Casey actually just pretty much stopped playing DeRozan with the bench. You don't even need to look at the on-off, lineup data or advanced stats to come to this conclusion, all you gotta do is consistently watch the Lowry DeRozan Raptors to come to it, the eye test makes it glaringly obvious that we played better with DeRozan on the bench than on the court whether that be with the starters or bench. Or just looking at the season when Lowry was splitting time at the PG with Calderon vs the next season where he was our true point guard we went up 14 wins which wasn't just that bump up in his role but was a big contributing factor. It kinda sucks cause DeRozan is a fucking legend in the city (my city love me like DeMar DeRozan) but lets stop with this ""Lowry wasn't the better player"" revisionist history. Especially coming from someone who ain't even a Raptors fan, like whose mans is this?  Oh, and don't forget, second option and second best are not the same thing. DeRozan was the first option scorer, but Lowry was the actual best player. Siakam was the second option on the championship team but it is clear Lowry was the second best player. Or for a non-Raptors example, Rudy Gobert was deemed the best player on the Jazz during Mitchell's rookie and sophomore season by many. PPG is not the end all be all of NBA basketball.  And Rondo wasn't a main guy either, he was a clear fourth banana behind the Big 3. You can never make any argument that Lowry was not the best player when with DeRozan or the 2nd best player when with Kawhi. It is set in stone."
"Do Cavs fans realize Mobley is a hyper athletic big with the mental game of a vet?  That pretty much destined him to have a HOF career.  He plays literally like Nene Hilario at the end of his career. And he’s 20. And he’s athletic as fuck. They said in the broadcast he’s contesting 18 ducking shots per game. And he’s guarding LeBron and AD without help, and without fouling like nothing.   He’s gonna be a monster. Rudy Gobert level would be a worst case scenario for what he is.  Jokic, Mobley, Luka, maybe Morant. They’ll own the 2020’s. And some other I’m sure. But these are the guys who are clearly gonna dominate in my mind."
Rudy Gobert
Some people even tried to scape goat Rudy Gobert for COVID in the NBA.
"&gt;He plays the exact same role as like 4 or 5 other guys on this roster, but he costs way more than all of them.  What is this logic? Rudy Gobert plays the exact same role as Deandre Jordan and Dwight Howard but costs way more, should you not want Rudy Gobert? Buddy costs way more because Buddy is easily one of the best shooters in the entire league.  Over the last 3 years, Monk, Nunn, and Ellington combined have made 815 threes (on 36%). Buddy on his own has made 831 threes (on 40%). Same role? Yes. Same effectiveness? Not even close.   There are cheap PGs in this league that can play when LeBron is on the bench that would be so much better on the team than 44 million/year Westbrook.  And yes, Hield is better than Westbrook at this point. Any team seriously trying to win a championship should want Hield over Westbrook."
"So Rudy Gobert at the rim is something like a 70% FG%, the only thing that stops him from being a consistently dominant offensive presence is that 1) he doesn't have a handle so teams can scheme on denying him the ball and 2) he is an inefficient free throw shooter.  Last year he had 10 FTA on less than 8 FGA per game.   You give him this you're basically turning him and guys like DeAndre Jordan into superheros because it doesnt matter they can't shoot."
"I'm not understanding how it would slow the game or encourage Rudy Gobert driving to the paint.  Re slowing: It gets rid of the incentive to foul at the end of the game, which would dramatically speed it up AND make the entire game about basketball instead of free-throw contests for the last 5 minutes.  Re Gobert: I don't get it at all.  Why would they do that instead of whatever normally gives the best chance at a bucket?"
"Still, I think it gives the referees more responsibility because the punishment for a foul is stronger on the defense.  There's not anything in the rules currently that gives a possession back other than a technical, so that represents a very very large change in the rules to be having technicals called as regular fouls.    I also think it probably slows the game down significantly.   Like watching Giannis attack the basket ten times in a row is one thing, watching Rudy Gobert do it is maybe not the kind of beautiful basketball you're hoping for."

Azuibuke is our raw big man prospect at 6’10”  Bojan is a 6’7” SF.  Rudy Gay is 6’8”.  Rudy Gobert is 7’1”.  Joe Ingles is 6’8”.  Hassan Whiteside is 7’.  We’re ok on size.
"Of the ballers I follow, Kyle Lowry and Rudy Gobert"
Well you see Rudy already took care of that /s  In all seriousness I think it’s actually more likely Mitchell misses than Gobert. In the regular season Rudy’s a just a better player and there’s a glut of star guards in the west. Though I think we’ll probably be a high enough seed to more or less demand 2 all stars. Winning matters way more than it probably should for all star selections. If Minnesota and New Orleans aren’t top 8 teams by the all star break (and I don’t think they will be) it’s more likely than not none of KAT/Ingram/Edwards make the team unless there’s injuries.
"Since he plays the 4 and the 5, he's probably competing for 6 forward and centre spots with:   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby and DeAndre Ayton.   Probably missed a few (Jimmy is usually a SG for these teams)."
"And? Rudy gobert has a ton of advantages over IT when it comes to rebounding,  is it unfair to say rudy is a better rebounder?"
"Rudy Gobert is definitely right that it's silly when these guys act like they're gonna fight on the court. But I still love it anyway. Let's just let everyone suspend disbelief and have guys continue to pretend they're gonna fight.   What I don't like is the ""meet me in the parking lot"" shit. Like ""If someone wants to fight, I’m easy to reach. We can take it off the court and deal with it as men."" for the most part, this is just as toothless as the shoving on the court. Does anyone really believe Rudy Gobert is gonna meet up with someone later and fight them over a foul in a basketball game? There's 0 chance.   I think the on court shit is more authentic. There's at least the occasional punch thrown."
rudy gobert didnt deserve that contract lemme tell you
Idk why anyone got even get remotely close to Rudy Gobert after he started the COVID fest two years ago
“Rudy Gobert pulled a guy down to the ground because his feeing were hurt that he was blocked on a layup so he fully initiated the fight” is the correct sentence.  You have it wrong as well.
"We got Rudy ""Zach Randolph"" Gobert out there"
"You’re not that guy pal, trust me.   -Rudy Gobert"
By r/nba standards Rudy gobert is a fake tough guy
Because Rudy Gobert is involved. Nuff said.
Rudy gobert=people
Rudy Gobert is just soft and weird. Turner was bout to throw a couple and Gobert hugs him like Turner is his lover
"&gt;	It’s actually funny because my boxing coach was at the game,” Gobert said….  lmao, there’s somethin hilarious about Rudy leading with this"
They cut out the beginning of the clip where Myles blocks Gobert and then Rudy drags Myles down to the ground by his shorts.

"""Rudy Gobert hugged a guy who shoved him so he fully initiated the fight"" is a weirder sentence when you really think about it"
"I’m arguing with a Jazz fan AND a Pacers fan in the same comment thread, LOL  Gobert had 2.7 blocks per game but only 2.3 fouls, Turner had 3.4 blocks per game but 3.5 fouls  Turner averaged 6.5 rebounds per game, Rudy averaged more than double that, 13.5  Rudy had the best eFG% in the league, a full 12% higher than Turner  Also basically every advanced defensive stat showed that Rudy had one of the all-time best defensive seasons in history"
Most fun sequence we've had all year lol. The stats don't really show it (outside of +-) but I think Turner was better than Gobert tonight. Turner prevented way more drives and he blocked Rudy twice. Think he was salty about it.
Rudy Gobert such a crybaby.  Turner shouldn’t have bumped him but no reason for Gobert to pull him down so he can’t get back on d just cuz he got stuffed.  That’s all on Rudy.
Dude Rudy pulled Myles down. Uncool from Gobert there.
Rudy Gobert is such a pussy man
"&gt; JV is top 40 all-time for career WS/48.  That's why Rudy Gobert is a better player than KD, he had a higher career WS/48. Or AD better than Duncan.  You cant really say JV has much better advanced stats and name only one. In the last 4 years Jrue has the same BPM and higher VORP, while also having a much higher RAPTOR and WAR for example.  &gt;  Every team he is on he makes better through advanced stats.  This also applies to Jrue."
It’s too early in the season to use on/off stats yet. For example Rudy Gobert had the best on/off numbers in the league last year and so far we’ve been 17 points per 100 possessions better with him on the bench. Probably 80% of on/off numbers at this point in the season are just shooting variance.
"I think in the 15-20 range. The players you are comparing him to there are people like Rudy Gobert, Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell, Zion and Bam. That seems about right to me."
If that’s the case Ayton is a bust like Bagley. You drafted a less polished Rudy Gobert over Luka
"It's funny to me when people act like the wolves were a surefire top seed had Jimmy Butler not gotten that injury. They went 8-9 in that 17 game stretch he was injured and the west was super close all of that season.  Also I'd say the wolves average to slightly above average in terms of team health that year. Jimmy Butler missing 23 games was their only significant injury and 3 of their starters played in literally every game.  The spurs were missing Kawhi 73 games. The warriors were missing Curry 31 games, KD 14 games, Klay 9 games, and Draymond 12 games. The rockets were missing CP3 24 games and Harden 10 games. The jazz were missing Rudy Gobert 26 games. All of those teams had similar injury issues or worse."
Dude can legit guard like Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert in the same possession. Its stupid.
"Teams like Houston and LAC found it advantageous to go small specifically because they weren't worried about rudy gobert as a post up or finishing threat downlow. The very same LA team that beat Utah with Small ball struggled to do the same against a team like phoenix because how monstrous Ayton is at destroying smalls in the paint. It wont be Mitchell or Conley who have the mismatch In these scenarios it would be gobert, and his inability to punish it is a big reason the clips won that series. Obviously there were plenty of other reasons but the clippers being able to get away with going small is definitely one of them  I agree there are many issues on the defensive side of the ball when facing 5 out offenses."
"Rudy Gobert is an MVP favorite? According to who, Rudy Gobert?"
I know right. They were the best team in the regular season last year and he’s a huge factor in them being great.  He doesn’t score or pass nearly as well as Giannis obviously but he gets blocks steals and rebounds on a similar level so he himself has a strong box score element. Also iirc they had poor backup C play since Favors is looking toast so Rudy’s on/off splits were nuts last year. Of course the data was going to say that Rudy was a monster.   Now does anyone actually think Giannis is the worse player? Of course not. But that doesn’t mean the stats broken because Gobert looks better in one season in Raptor than Giannis. In the same way we don’t give Lebron the MVP every year because he doesn’t have the best regular season even though he was/maybe still is the best player in the league. The Jazz won the most games and had the best net rating in the league. Of course the player that makes their system go would be ranked really high.
"Player A: *Averages 16 ppg with high efficiency and ball movement improves when he's on the floor*  Player B: *Has 27 points on 25 shots and fucking dunks on Rudy Gobert*  Media: loool get fucked, Gobert"
"C'mon, you don't like RAPTOR because you think it underrates Durant.  &gt;Every year their preseason predictions are way off, and they are based on RAPTOR player ratings  The in-season RAPTOR ratings are not based on their pre-season predictions, and their predictions are not just simple averages of prior RAPTOR ratings.  &gt; Last year they said that Rudy Gobert is better than Giannis  Every advanced impact metric said this."
The fact Rudy Gobert is the only player in the league that gets blamed for every point scored by the opposition when he's on the floor is a testament to him being the best defender in the league.
"It honestly says a lot about Rudy Gobert and the way opposing teams have to play him. He’s the main reason we lead the league in free throw rate. Rudy draws more fouls than anyone besides Giannis and Embiid, but has an incredibly low usage rate. He gets us into the bonus almost every quarter.   Offensive rebounding is another obvious way. Gobert’s just bigger than everyone and has really committed to fighting for every rebound this year. His ORB numbers would probably be even better if he weren’t fouled so frequently on them.   Rudy’s also causally putting in a league best true shooting of .73  That being said, I think defenses way overreact to Rudy. You can stop Rudy Gobert from scoring any points outside of putbacks, but the cost of doing that is very high. Defenses are committing multiple defenders to Rudy on virtually every roll and leaving someone else open. Fake passes to Rudy almost always work. Gobert’s also a master at turning his rolls into (probably illegal) screens to get our ball handlers wide open layups.   I think teams would be better off just letting Rudy get his 20 points on 12 shots than doing what they’re doing now, which is selling out their whole defensive game plan to stop a guy who’s averaged 12 ppg over his career. Gobert’s a good offensive player, and every point he scores also seems to inflict some kind of psychological damage onto teams, but I don’t think he’s nearly good enough to have the kind of offensive gravity he currently does."
"He's a Star. Superstars are guys like LeBron/Steph/KD/Harden and who have actually proved something in the league.  Basically if you haven't won an MVP/DPOY/been the best player on a championship team, no chance you're actually a superstar.  And with how important offense is and how neutered defense is I debate if even a DPOY selection or 3 can make you a superstar. Rudy Gobert isn't one, even though he's got a few DPOYs."
"Unironically RAPTOR seems to be a bit questionable to me lol  Every year their preseason predictions are way off, and they are based on RAPTOR player ratings  Last year they said that Rudy Gobert is better than Giannis and that Capela is better than Curry  Ball dominant guards and rim protecting centers are overrated by their algorithm(notice the examples of Gobert and Capela)"
Rudy Gobert is a good basketball player.
"The jazz aren't even that hostile of a fanbase.  I'm referring to Zion's lack of concern over turning his body into a beast in the NBA.  Look at What Ayton did with his first few years in the NBA.  Giannis.  Rudy Gobert had a massive transformation.  And then Zion comes in 16 lbs heavier than last year.  His knees are going to get ruined.  I'm using some imagery, for sure, but it's still a fair and true criticism being shared by national pundits.    Just in case this is referring to the Russell Westbrook racist smear campaign against the jazz - what he says is not representative of me or the majority of us.  It is representative of *the one guy* he called out."
"If you think that Rudy Gobert is just tall, long and blocks shots, then I don't know what to tell you. You don't understand NBA defense at all.   In Gobert's three DPOY seasons, his team has ranked 2nd, 2nd, and 4th in defensive ranking.   Now do the following exercise:   List the players he's played with in that time who are better than slightly-above-average defenders.   He is a transformative defender who changes everything opposing teams try to do on offense. He has orders of magnitude more impact than Ron Artest or Gary Payton."
"Normally I agree with idea that DPOY shouldn't just go to the best shot blocker in the league.  But I think it is under appreciated just how elite Gobert is at guarding the paint.  [Here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/) is a good FiveThiryEight piece on what a defensive monster Gobert really is.   I heard a while ago that the most efficient shots in basketball are:   1. Free Throws   2. Dunks and Layups   3. 3 point shots   So if a guy is insanely elite at stopping dunks and layups while not sending guys to the line, then that guy has eliminated the 2 most efficient shots in the game and therefore has a pretty good argument for DPOY."
"The Jazz are always a great defensive team and Gobert is their only all nba defender in recent history. His rim protection changes regular season games more than any other single player. He changed a game much more than Artest or Payton. Wallace is arguable, but who should have gotten it? Kawhi is always hurt, AD misses a ton of time and Draymond’s effort is up and down in the regular season.  What I never hear from people is who should have gotten them over Rudy."
Rudy Gobert on a team is an instant top 3 defense regardless of teammates so yes

The Warriors have a better net rating with Draymond off the court. Draymond isn't leading the Warriors defense by himself. Everyone on the team is playing fantastic defense without Draymond. This isn't the Jazz where Rudy Gobert automatically makes the team into a top 3 defense regardless of the players.

"I was too focused on Morris's elbow and hip, didn't even notice the knee. Good call, man. No wonder Jokic was so enraged. Rudy Gobert took him out of the game with some knee on knee contact to that right knee only two weeks ago."
rudy gobert triple double

The Jazz defence was 8pts per 100 better in the playoffs with Rudy on vs off. Teams definitely tried to target him but it was the rest of the teams defence that really cost them. In the Clippers series the Jazz had a 135 DRTG without Gobert. Awful.
"It depends on the game, my mood, etc. That last game vs Orlando I just shrugged off since it was second half of back to back missing Conley and lots of traveling. I do have games occasionally that bum me out quite a bit though, usually when a player gets injured  Edit: I think the most bummed I got was actually the last Jazz game before the covid shutdown. We lost to the Raptors and Ibaka called Rudy Gobert Rudy Gay, and I was so mad because that was such a creative burn lol"
"Rudy Gobert might be underrated. The actual lesson to take from the playoffs is that Utah doesn’t have one perimeter guy on the roster than can guard one on one and they’re lucky to have Gobert, an average starting C they’d be a bottom 5 defense in the league."
Rudy Gobert is absolutely an elite defender. He might not be switchable but his rim protection is so damn good that it alone makes him an elite defender.
Lol Rudy Gobert is not an overrated defender. Never before have I seen a man get this blasted over his teammates mistakes. It's not his fault that he can't 1v5 everytime the Jazz guards blow a rotation or let a guy slip past them   In fact the only player on ur overrated list whos actually overrated rn is Kawhi and thats mainly due to him coasting rather than actual ability
Rudy Gobert. Misses out on multiple plays because of complaining/fishing for fouls.
"Thus question can be viewed from 2 different ways.   1: dunkers who could make amazing,  insane dunks. Answer to this IMO Carter  2: the most efficient dunkers. They are able to dunk the ball at in insanely high rate. Answer to this one is Shaq or Giannis. Unironcally, Rudy Gobert is in the conversation here (he destroyed the record for most dunks in a season recently)"
&gt;We call that looking at box scores and not watching games.  Says the absolute clown who says Rudy Gobert doesn't contribute to winning.  You're a joke.
Yeah I really doubt he's insecure over Rudy Gobert.
"You do have a choice, you can always let him walk and rebuild in search of a greater player in the draft, people just prefer to consistently be average than to try to be great.  The Utah Jazz will be an average NBA team for the next half decade because they chose to pay Rudy Gobert 200M, that's it. Utah is stuck in first/second round hell and that's literally the worst position you can be in the NBA, you aren't close to a championship and you aren't drafting high enough to get a future superstar."
Holy shit you'd rather have Draymond over Rudy Gobert in 2021.
So what? Shaq was still a waaaaaay better player than Gobert ever will be. If anything that proves how overrated individual defense is. Shaq is arguably top 10 player all time. Rudy Gobert isn't even top 20 right now.
"In today's game with a ridiculously fast pace, in Shaq's era Rudy would literally average 8-10 a game as he has zero moves on offense and relies on putbacks and easy layups/dunks. He's a one way player the same way Trae Young is, the only difference is that Trae is great on the more important side of the court in today's game.  The Jazz didn't pay Rudy Gobert because he is worth this money, they payed him because they felt they didn't have a choice and now they are stuck in first/second round hell."
"&gt; Both Russell and Kareem are greater than Shaq.  Greater? Sure, but if we are talking better in their peaks it is debatable.  This isn't hating though, Rudy Gobert isn't worth the contract he was given and the Utah Jazz won't sniff a championship paying him and Donovan Mitchell 200+M. Shaq's point is pretty simple, if you can't score 25+ while playing 35 minutes every game, then you aren't a dominant big man and that's true.  The Jazz payed Gobert because they felt they had no choice, not because they think he is worth this kind of money, Utah's best chance right now is Mitchell becoming an MVP candidate, otherwise they will be stuck in first/second round hell for 5-7 years.  Rudy Gobert is the Trae Young version of a big man, dominant on one side and garbage on the other, the difference is that Trae is a ball handler and is dominant on the more important side of the floor."
4-5 points? Gobert averaged 16/13 on 70% true shooting and DPOY defense last year. Shaq grabbed that many rebounds only a couple times and rarely played DPOY defense over the course of a full season. Rudy is 4X 1st team all defense and 2X DPOY. Also 16 points is literally 4 points a quarter.   Also Rudy makes free throws at a higher clip than Shaq lol.
"yo fuck Rudy Gobert, so over rated. Shaq aint wrong, just a bit obnoxious"
Shaq had one single season where he was top 10 in offensive rating and defensive rating in the same year.   Rudy Gobert has done that 2 years in a row now. (In 2018-2019 he was top 5 in both)

"Dennis Rodman brought 5 rings to the offense, what has Rudy Gobert done so far?  Dennis Rodman was so great he allowed his teammate to concentrate on offense and win the leagues MVP in a yr where Hakkem, Shaq, Pippen, Clyde, Ewing had big years. That player was David Robinson, Gobert needs to become a scoring threat, he deffo is not a scoring threat at all. If he was, when they double Mitchell why do they leave Gobert on an island?"
So Rudy Gobert? Career 63FT%
"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bendowsett/2020/06/29/rudy-goberts-improved-perimeter-defense-is-an-major-tool-for-the-utah-jazz/  “The NBA’s stingiest defenders against isolation possessions, per that same tracking data (minimum 75 possessions defended, a sample of 130 players):  1.    Rudy Gobert: 0.688 points per chance allowed  2.    Jerami Grant: 0.702 points per chance  3.    Jrue Holiday: 0.709 points per chance  For those who don’t spend their days studying NBA scoring numbers: That’s really low. Even when you add roughly 0.15 to a team’s figure to account for potential offensive rebounds on misses (standard among math folks in the league), you’re talking about efficiency in the low-80s on a per-100-possession basis – the NBA’s worst offense averaged just under 105 this year by comparison.”"
"How many times do we have to see Rudy Gobert get absolutely embarrassed by guards in the playoffs before we can stop calling him a DPOY caliber player. He's a great anchor and rim protector, but the man gets absolutely abused in pick and rolls."
Rudy Gobert would probably force Shaq at least a little bit with his size and length.
"Ironically Mutombo, arguably Rudy Gobert of Shaq's era, got a big payday after averaging 11 points per game in his last season at Denver. At some point he was the second highest paid player in the league right after Shaq I believe."
Nephews need to learn reading comprehension. Dikembe Mutumbo was a minor star outside of the NBA. Outside of the NBA no one knows who Rudy Gobert is.
He’s not a good offensive player.  He can’t create offense for himself or others.  If anything it shows how good his teammates are for setting him up.  With the game on the line they are never going let’s get Rudy Gobert a touch
Dikembe and Rudy Gobert are like Chris Paul and Tony Parker......comparable but definitely a difference in quality.
Because Rudy Gobert is not as good as Dikembe was. You said “if Dikembe played now”.   Dikembe’s stats were like 5 rebounds and 2 blocks a game better than Rudy.
But that’s also disrespectful to say “if he played today”.   Stats are stats and people these days try to tear those accomplishments down because they think this era is some god send. No one in the 90’s tore down the stats before them. They showed respect and then put up better numbers.  Dikembe averaged like 2 more blocks a game than Gobert and was the same on rebounds after he averaged like 3 rebounds a game for 5 seasons in his late career. If he had retired in his prime he would have averaged like 5 more rebounds than Gobert.   You can make excuses for points and blocks if you want but rebounds should translate to any era.   Dikembe was a freak of Nature star center. Rudy Gobert is a solid center. But he’s paid because he’s a valuable asset in an NBA lacking in great bigs.
Shaq 100% thinks Julius Randle is better than Rudy Gobert.
I can’t read and somehow mistook it for Rudy Gobert
"DeMar might have the most underrated posters ever  Chris Boucher, Rudy Gobert, Rubio, past Butler and then on prime Noah, TT, Singler the GOAT, Mozgod, pushes it to OT over Tolliver  I think Butler might be a better finisher but DeRozan is more explosive and not that far off"
The lack of Rudy Gobert answers here is astounding
"Gobert. He doesn’t get to show it off much in today’s league, but Rudy is an unbelievably good post defender. Embiid is the closest approximation to Shaq in today’s league and he’s struggled mightily against Gobert (IIRC H2H Joel has shot 42% against Rudy). Jokic has found success from midrange and 3 against Rudy but more or less abandons the post game. It would come down to officiating, but I firmly believe Gobert could more than hold his own defending Shaq, and certainly more than any other center in today’s league."
Rudy Gobert contract   2021 - $25.7 million  2022 - $34.8 million  2023 - $37.6 million  2024 - $40.4 million   2025 - $43.2 million  2026 - $46.6 million   Myles Turner contract   2021 - $18 million  2022 - $18 million  2023 - $18 million    What the fuck are we even talking about exactly? Rudy Gobert is one of the most overpaid players on the planet. The Utah Jazz signed their NEVER EVER GOING TO WIN A RING warrant when they extended him for that much money. If Rudy Gobert is your 4th or 5th highest paid player you can absolutely win a ring... but if he’s your 1st or 2nd highest paid player you aren’t winning shit. He’s a one dimensional big man who can’t shoot a lick.   He’s also a gaping asshole so ya.  I just don’t get how anyone can act like that dude deserves 40 million dollars per season for the next half decade. Nearly 190 million dollars guaranteed lmao.  The only thing that makes any sense is they resigned him so he’s easier to trade..? But not many teams are dumb enough to take on that bloated embarrassing contract.   They need to trade him before Mitch decides he wants a trade of his own
Rudy Gobert might be the Jazz’s best player.
When you hear “the basketball player Rudy G.” do you think Gobert or Gay or Giuliani
Rudy Gobert. Nobody had him anywhere near All-NBA. It was questionable wether he would stay 4 years in the league.
"Draymond green, Rudy Gobert. Isaiah Thomas (small one)  Edit: [one of draymond comps was Jared Dudley lol](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/draymond-green/)"
"I’m absolutely in favor of gobert being above sabonis (even though I love sabonis and think he’s probably top 30-40 rather than top 20) and believe that gobert is *also* underrated by most people, BUT...  saying that he made Jokic look pedestrian in that playoff series is IMO really inaccurate. I think part of this narrative comes in because Jamal went nuclear and Jokic was more than happy to play around Jamal instead of the other way around for once, particularly because Jamal had a much better matchup with Utah’s perimeter defenders. Jokic didn’t need to challenge Rudy on every possession. But just because Rudy was a tougher matchup than the perimeter defenders and the nuggets opted to attack with the dude dropping 40+ every game doesn’t mean Rudy made Jokic look pedestrian lol.  He averaged 26.3 points, 8.1 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 1.1 stocks on 52/48/85 splits. 62.4% TS, and a 127 ORTG. Including the game winner directly over Rudy in the last 30 seconds to win the series when it counted.  I don’t see any world in which that’s pedestrian, just because it took a backseat to the Mitchell v Murray narrative where the were both on fire scoring.  Credit to gobert for making things more difficult for Jokic, absolutely. He’s one of the few who can. But I have yet to see Jokic have a pedestrian playoff series. The closest thing was probably games 2-3 of that series where it seemed like the whole team just didn’t care and was going through the motions. But for an entire series? Haven’t seen it yet."
"&gt; Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert  Those 2 are very good, but I think they are less impactful than Sabonis is, at least in this season so far. Oh and Doncic he will be a super star, but this season he is below Sabonis performance too."
Rudy Gobert clearly above him? Not sure about that
Regular Season: Rudy Gobert  Playoffs: Anthony Davis  Honorable mention: Giannis and Bam
"Top 20 is tough.  LeBron, Giannis, Durant, Kahwi, Harden, AD, Doncic, Jokic, Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Embiid, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert are imo clearly above him. If Chris Paul is still the player he was last year then he's on that list as well. That's seventeen players.  Then you've got a group of Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns and Bam Adebayo who are also above him in my opinion. That takes it to 22 already.  Khris Middleton, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray, Zion Williamson, Trae Young, Siakam and Porzingis would be my next tier. That's where I see Sabonis.  He's imo a top 30 player."
"Nephew cool down the hot takes. 2 time rebound leader, 3 time consecutive DPOY and 5 time First Team All NBA doesn't have a legacy? He's ""just another NBA player"". This guy wasn't no Rudy Gobert type of dude either he was Superman. His legacy goes beyond his game. There is still the ""what if"" factor with him, he could have been an all time great with the right mentality. The ring makes him a 100% lock.    Dont believe me? Check this out: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html   Dwight ranks 47th and there are no eligible people above him that are not in.

"&gt; Plus, Iverson was their starting shooting guard and leading scorer, but he was pretty much the worst shooter on the team.   You're assuming that other players on the team could have shot better, if given the same workload Iverson had.   DeAndre Jordan (76% TS) is a significantly more efficient shooter than Kevin Durant (65% TS). Does that mean KD is a worse shooter? Or does it reflect more on the fact that KD has to carry an offensive burden that DJ doesn't? Is Kevon Looney (66% TS) an equally good shooter as Steph (66% TS)? Or does Looney get much easier shots, because Steph draws all the defensive attention?   Iverson carrying the offensive workload allowed his teammates to focus on what their respective strengths were, just like KD and Steph allow their teammates to focus on other things besides creating their own offense.   If you watched the 2001 Sixers, a lot of times what would happen is Iverson would drive, draw multiple defenders, and basically just flip it up towards the rim for his teammates to get an easy offensive rebound and putback. On the stat sheet, that's a negative play for Iverson (0/1 FG). In reality, Iverson created that score by drawing the interior defenders to himself, which created the scoring opportunity for his teammates - it's as much as ""assist"" as Rudy Gobert setting a good screen, or Mark Jackson dribbling in place at the top of the key while Reggie Miller runs off 3 different screens.    In 2000-01, the Sixers were 5th in Offensive Rebounds, despite being only 19th in FGA. They were 2nd in OffReb%. That's in part due to defending bigs having to leave their man to help against Iverson.   In the 2001 Eastern playoffs, the Sixers were 7-2 when Iverson shot 30+ FGA. They were 4-5 when he shot fewer than 30 FGA. If Iverson were hurting his team by shooting, those W-L records should be reversed."
"Yeah it’s kinda like the elite cornerback effect in football. People like to look at stats but if you’re a lockdown defender, no QB’s gonna throw it your way, so you’ll hardly ever get any interceptions. Joel and Rudy Gobert are similar to that with their paint presence. Everybody thinks twice going in the paint against them."
The players from that year who are still in the league:  Rudy Gobert  Derrick Favors  Gandalf Handlebars  Enes Kanter  Trey Burke  Alec Burks
"Rudy All time great  Myles good  It aint ""bad"" to be behind Gobert lol"
"Easily. Has been for years.   Conley and Donovan are great, but both are undersized. Having Gobert makes it possible for them to shine in a big way and playable against superstar players. The reason that Conley's +/- minutes are so huge is because he plays 90% of his minutes with Gobert (who also has huge +/- minutes.)  I don't know if you follow the NFL, but imagine what it would be like if no one ever talked about the importance of offensive and defensive lines. Only linebackers, corners and offensive skill positions.  That is kind of like the NBA today. Rudy Gobert is basically like having the top offensive AND defensive line on a football team. Nobody spends hours talking about the Browns offensive line, but it sure makes a difference for them and makes the likes of Baker Mayfield into a star."
"&gt;Gobert elevates his team to no less than 50 wins. Beal elevates his team to, what, 30 in a much weaker conference?  This line of thinking is hella weird. The Utah Jazz have always had a stacked team. They've always been extremely balanced and well built. There is no proof the he elevates the team to their record. He's the best player on the team, but there is a close second, and then an extremely solid 3rd and 4th option. I'm not going to attribute Utah's success to just Rudy. They're like the Raptors of the West. Kyle Lowry is the best player, but Siakam is one hell of a second option with a plethora of role players and a solid coach/GM. Beal plays for the Wizards man. Look at hoe good they were when they put good players around Wall/Beal."
"&gt;Gobert elevates his team to no less than 50 wins. Beal elevates his team to, what, 30 in a much weaker conference?  Since Gobert has been on the Jazz, they have broken 50 wins twice in the last 8 years, how are you concluding Gobert ""elevates his team to 50 wins"" ?  &gt;Tatum and Brown might have had an argument until you look at their record.   Their team has underperformed quite a lot over the last couple seasons.  What? What the hell is this? Since Tatum/Brown/Gobert have been in the league, the Boston Celtics have had a better record than the Jazz every single year except 2018-2019 where their records were 49-33 and 50-32 respectively.Of that course, The Celtcs have been to the ECF three times in that span. The utah Jazz have not been to the WCF since Rudy Gobert entered the league.  &gt;Kyrie is good but if I'm building a team I'll take Gobert over him every time.  Suit yourself.  &gt;PG is the only one on that list who I think people can argue is better than Gobert but even then I don't think he's as impactful, and he certainly hasn't had more post season success so that can't be used as an argument.  PG was in serious MVP consideration as little as 2 seasons ago, and is a perrential All Star.  It seems that your judgement is severely impacted by the Jazz hot start as of this season because some of your arguments for why Gobert is better thnan most of these guys doesnt really hold up under any serious consideration beyond ""the jazz are really good this year"""
"Yeah guys who are pure play finishers don't make it unless they're Rudy Gobert level impact players. Otherwise, you gotta be a guy like Embiid, Sabonis, Bam, and Vic who can cook on heir own. That's not even getting into the big wings like Hayward and Harris."
"Hard to win against a top tier team like the Jazz when you’re missing your top 2 players, but I liked what I saw from the boys. Also Rudy Gobert is fucking underrated and I now see the light. Good game Jazz bros"
"This is called efficiency.  Add to that the fact that Rudy Gobert is the defensive pillar of the best NBA team, and you will agree with me that he is the DPOY so far.  Shaq won't like it, of course, but the facts are there."
"gobert is the best defender in the history of the nba  for those upset about this, come check with me when rudy is done and has every trophy"
"&gt; You realise that with Gobert you're the favorite to come out of the East with decent odds in the Finals, right?  If Toronto added Gobert without removing any of their pieces (which wouldn't be possible), I would still probably take Philly and Brooklyn and potentially even Milwaukee over Toronto.  Rudy is an impactful player, but there's a massive talent gap between Toronto and the top teams in the East, and Rudy doesn't make up for all of that."
Is he better than LeBron? No.  Is he better than Kawhi? No.  Is he better than Nikola Jokic? No.  Is he better than Paul George? No.  Is he better than Anthony Davis? No.  Is he better than Luka Doncic? No.  Is he better than Rudy Gobert? No.  Is he a guard? No.  Is he an All-Star? Only as an injury replacement.
no i mean that rudy gobert will forcibly bench him  gobert is a very strong and large man
"Look, we have a lot of really good players. Great players even. But Rudy Gobert is obscenely good. Like it’s disgusting how much of an impact he has everywhere. Which is what makes guys like Jokic all the more impressive."
"Rudy gobert shuts down the league, again."
He’s having a great season and I think we should honor it by creating The Rudy Gobert MVRP award. Most Valuable Role Player.
I feel like he's the exact definition of a ceiling raiser.       In [2013-14](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2014.html) the Jazz went just 25-57 and had the 29th ranked defensive rating in the NBA. Rookie Gobert started zero games.       In [2014-15](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2015.html) the Jazz were just 19-34 (29 win pace) by the all star break. [They had the 27th ranked defensive rating in the NBA.](https://stats.nba.com/teams/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2014-15&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DateTo=2%2F8%2F15)        .      After the all star break Quin Snyder then started sophomore Rudy Gobert in all their games for the rest of the season and Utah finished the season 19-10 in their last 29 games. (50+ win pace) The Jazz in those final 29 games with Gobert starting had [the league's 1st ranked defensive rating.](https://stats.nba.com/teams/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2014-15&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DateFrom=2%2F12%2F2015).    The rest is history as the following season with Rudy now a certified started the Jazz conceded the 2nd fewest points per game in the league.
"It's Schrodinger's contract. On a free and open market, Rudy Gobert is not worth $41m. If I have $41m or more in cap space, I'm sure as hell not offering Rudy that contract. But if I risk losing him for nothing and only having a vet min + MLE to sign an replacement? I'm running to his door.   Rudy is a great player on the Jazz because they have good players otherwise. He takes a good team and makes them great; he's a ceiling-raiser. But Rudy Gobert is not getting dropped on the Wizards and magically fixing all of their issues. It's a similar situation with Kyle Lowry's big contract and Chris Paul's big contract. I'm staying the fuck away from those if I'm a rebuilding team, because they aren't taking you from the lottery to the playoffs. But if you're a team like the Raptors, Rockets, Thunder, or Suns who want to go from a good team to great team, I take those two guys in a heartbeat."

"I can see that. I think its understandable that many black players could hesitant to get the vaccine due to past racist healthcare policies. But while I do believe that this is part of the equation for some players, I think most players' reluctance is likely less principled and more about not really feeling the need to do it. A significant portion of NBA players (over 100) have already gotten covid with zero issues, and this doesn't include players who most likely had it but never were tested before Rudy Gobert, or players who were never tested during the break from March to June. And basketball players are all young and some of the most physically healthy people in the entire world. It's important to remember that most NBA players are in their 20's, a demographic known for feeling invincible and on top of the world. And they are all filthy rich with access to the best Healthcare money can buy. Most are single with no kids, and most have parents who aren't even 60 yet. There is little reason to think that many of these players have any urgent desire to get a vaccine for a disease that doesn't really pose a threat to them. And I think many of their objections simply come from not wanting to be forced to do something they don't want to do and don't feel like they need to do. Not that there aren't any whose reluctance stems from deeper, systemic, racial issues, but I think those player are probably in the minority.   As for stats, here's where I got my numbers: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1122431/coronavirus-covid19-death-rate-by-race-us/   Not sure why the cdc decided to display their data the way they did. It's much less clear, and much easier to take the wrong way. I find it odd that they used white people as a baseline and then chose to pit the rates of other races against that somewhat arbitrary baseline. Especially since there are races that had better rates than white people. And when you are dealing with very small numbers like 120/100,000 compared to 155/100,000 are statically almost indistinguishable, but the way the rates on the cdc chart are displayed makes the difference seem much more profound. If you think about those numbers as if they were dollars, is there really that much difference if out of $100,000 you lose $155.00 compared to losing $120.00?"
That the MVP goes to the best player on the best team is logically consistent with Rudy Gobert being on pace for MVP. Re-examine your understanding of the award (and maybe the player) on that basis.
Like how Rudy Gobert obviously deserves MVP over the fraud Jokic
Rudy Gobert 2021 NBA MVP
"It's interesting that Rudy Gobert is seen as a lock for allstar, but Simmons is not. Most people I've talked to have Simmons as DPOY runnerup (or 3rd at worst).   Why exactly is 15/8/8 with 2-3rd best defense not good enough, but 14/14/1 is? I'm not arguing against any players allstar campaign here, but I think it's inconsistent."
"[Basketball Reference is your friend.] (https://imgur.com/a/2VcQXMc) If you check this and allow for an injury, that’s a lot of playoff minutes.  Gobert has never been played off the court in a playoff series. I know the fanpages you follow on twitter will have you believe that, but it's never happened in reality. If you question whether Rudy can carry the same level of dominance in the playoffs, that's a fair question. If you say Rudy gets played off the floor in the playoffs, that's simply false."
"I don’t care how you get your shots, if you’re getting nearly 25 points a game, your efficient as fuck and valuable to your team whether you’re Steph curry or Rudy Gobert. And Zion is getting his own shots and it’s amazing to watch, and some part of me doesn’t truly understand how he’s doing it. On some level I wonder “why hasn’t Lebron ever just decided to be this good around the rim?”"
Best player best team is Rudy Gobert right now
Dort scored 6 points with Gobert even in the vicinity. Most of his buckets came when Rudy was on the bench.      People on this subreddit really need to watch games if they're going to comment on them and not just read box scores
"Ben Simmons is simply a hater.  He should stop being jealous of Rudy Gobert for his contract.  Rudy Gobert is essential to the Jazz's success and that's why he was paid that price.  If Ben Simmons is unable to understand that, too bad for him."

Rudy Gobert LITERALLY generically invented to coronavirus in a lab instead of working on his offensive game 😤😤😤
Ben Simmons was 3-of-7 for nine of his 42 points when defended by Rudy Gobert in that game.
Lebron and AD being DPOY candidates is like Donavon Mitchell and Rudy Gobert being MVP candidates bruh.
"Rudy gobert when guarding Embiid and Simmons in their 40 point games.     Simmons: 9 PTS, 3/7 0/0 3PT, 42%    Embiid: 17 PTS 8/18 1/4 3PT, 44%"
"Why is Philly 4 points worse defensively with Simmons on the floor than Jazz with Gobert on the floor? It's not their teammates because Ben gets to share the floor with Embiid and while Rudy doesn't have another elite defender next to him.  You spend most of your time off ball. Being able to guard your man well isn't as impactful. Simmons guards players well, Rudy shuts down teams."
"Theres been a little back and forth , no printed T-Shirts or Billboard signs yet though   Rudy -  &gt;""To me, it's about impact. It's about how much impact you can have on the court and how much impact we can have on your teammates. And at the end of the day, how much impact you can have on your team and on the other team,"" Gobert said.  &gt;""It's not about being cute. It's not about looking good. It's not about narratives. It's not about having a big name,"" he continued. It's about coming out every single night, trying to grind defensively and have that impact on the game.  &gt;""When people are going to campaign for themselves, I think it's great, you know. But for me, it's just being worried about my team, how can I help my team every single night and how can we keep getting better as a team?"""
"It was almost a monumental collapse, but they pulled it off!  2 time DPoY Rudy Gobert leaving D'lo open for that lay up seemed like it was happening in slow motion, I could believe it"

DPOY Rudy gobert with a great play here
Man could you imagine Rudy gobert with a jumper
Man I thought Mo Bamba was gonna be a better shooting Rudy Gobert
"Gobert isn't an elite man to man post defender, so players like Hakeem would still be able to get their own against him. You could argue tho that Rudy would be even better in an era where teams attack the paint more compared to the greater spacing in todays game. However other elite defenders from the past like Eaton wouldn't do as well, due to teams attempting more 3s and taking fewer shots at the rim. Eaton would probably be too slow to keep up."
"Just checked and he said Rudy was good in the paint and went on to flame him lmfao  “I loved it when I saw Rudy (Gobert) was guarding me,” Simmons mentioned after the game. “I love being able to go at somebody like that. I felt like it was a little bit of a disrespect putting him on me, but it is what it is.”  This week, Simmons issued credit where it's due to Gobert by calling him ""great in the paint"" on ESPN's The Jump, but he also brought up the versatility factor once again. ""He guarded me in Utah,"" the three-time All-Star said. ""And I had 42. And apparently, I'm not a scorer, so it is what it is.""  He's indirectly calling him not versatile on defence"
Fuck Rudy Gobert.
Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert had a horseshoe up his ass!
"Not really too much to criticize from Snyder this year. His rotations have been both creative and extremely successful. My only real critique would be that he should’ve played Gobert more minutes in a number of games. With Gobert running 3 stints per half, there was a good amount of time where Rudy was just sitting on the sideline for 2 minutes waiting to sub in without a dead ball scenario. We got killed in those minutes and I wish Quinn would’ve used more timeouts to get Rudy in. However it looks like we were trying to manage Rudy’s minutes somewhat and we still managed to get the 1 seed so idk if that matters all that much. Rudy needs to be playing 40 mpg in the playoffs though."
"Tell me lol. Look at this statement from Zach Lowe from this year ROY against 2016-2017 ROY.   His statement from choosing LaMelo [""Given some baseline threshold of availability, I don't prioritize minutes quite as much in the ""of year"" awards as in MVP.""](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31440899/nikola-jokic-joel-embiid-rudy-gobert-draymond-green-lowe-selects-2021-nba-award-winners)  And his statement from not choosing Joel Embiid [Unfortunately, the NBA season consists of 82 games. Had Embiid played more of them, Philly might have actually been a playoff team. I'm sorry that one of the baseline requirements for being a productive NBA player is playing in NBA games.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19140550/zach-lowe-picks-nba-mvp-defensive-player-year-rookie-year-more-awards)"
"For whatever reason, I've listened to Simmons' podcast for like 10 years. I remember his issue has always been that he didn't feel like the Jazz had that crunch time guy to win you games. Over ten years, I don't disagree with that necessarily. But in the past couple of weeks he has gone out and said he's voting Ben over Rudy for some contrived reason (no word on how his ballot actually came out yet). And he had a new writer on recently who said something about how he hates Gobert because he was emotional when he didn't make the all star game, and yeah, Bill ate that up and egged his guest on. It just doesn't make sense to me why he is such a tool about it. Considering finding a new pod to listen to while walking the dog."
"People who have never seen a Jazz game love claiming this.   &gt;  Rudy Gobert is in the 99th percentile on Defensive Plus-Minus. He is the 90th percentile in Block Rate, the 97th percentile in Rim Defense, 90th percentile in Isolation Defense and 94th percentile in Pick and Roll Defense. Opponents shoot 12 percent less from the field when guarded by Rudy Gobert."
Rudy Gobert will make sure that doesn’t happen
Some casual fans really believe that Ben Simmons would do a better job than Rudy Gobert at defending the rim
Rudy Gobert
"Do you not remember when Mitchell turned the ball over with 8 seconds left in the game? Such a shame that Mitchell let all his teammates down because he can’t dribble. That series loss is obviously completely on him based on your argument of one play deciding everything. You brought up Hezonja blocking LeBron as if that helped your case at all. Why do use the logic that Gobert can’t stop Murray on one single play, but not that Murray could get by Gobert on one single play? It could’ve been just as big of a fluke for Jamaal as for Rudy. Anything can happen on one play."
"They’re crazy if they think teams don’t have to game plan around Rudy Gobert. Isn’t there a stat where he just straight up deters people from even attempting shots at the rim? Also Rudy is running away with DPOTY, don’t think it’ll be all that close."
Rudy Gobert deserves so much more respect
"people do score on rudy gobert. its actually not impossible. also basketball is 5 on 5  also those ""crazy layups he did so often during the bubble"" that you mentioned? why do you think they were so crazy?"
He literally thinks that teams don’t game-plan for Rudy Gobert. Wait till he sees shot distribution with Rudy on the court vs off.
Never let Shaq talk about Rudy Gobert
the rudy gobert slander was expected and lulworthy
"Warriors have a top 5 defense too.  Hard to believe? There offense is highly dependent on Steph.  But who’s to say he can’t average over 32 ppg in this series? A lot will be dependent on if Rudy Gobert finds his self off the floor as he often does versus the Warriors.  He can’t really guard the pick and roll.  He gets put in a blender.    The X factor for Utah is Conley.  If he plays well, then everything else should fall in line.  But The Dubs can easily play into The Jazz and their style of play.  They like to go up and down too.  The Lakers are a much much tougher matchup as seen last night cause they are the best defensive team when they choose to be so, and their style of play is so different than the warriors and jazz.  They like to slow it down.    So I actually think this potential Warriors Jazz series will be competitive.  I have the Jazz as favorites but wouldn’t be surprised at all if The Warriors somehow won.  I mean they have a top 15 player ever on their team.  Ever"
Pg Cp3 Sg John wall  Sf Tobias harris  Pf Kevin love  C Rudy Gobert
because rudy gobert and donovan mitchell are over-rated
"I love the talent of this era, and I love that we have more international talent now as well. Think about how many of our current stars would have been behind the iron curtain in the 80s. And I agree with your point on athleticism. As a Jazz fan, I can see the difference between Mark Eaton and Rudy Gobert. I don't love Mark any less, but I appreciate that Gobert is a much better athlete. Training, science, diet, injury care, everything is better today than it was. Guys are bigger and faster.   That said, though, my favorite time was the 90s, the Dream Team days. That era flowing from Bird and Magic to MJ to Kobe, with guys like Hakeem, Drexler, Stockton, Shaq, David Robinson, a billion others I haven't mentioned: that was a golden age. Just as a mention, CP3 is a HoF player. But keep in mind he's still 5000 assists (and 900 steals!) behind Stockton. I'm only calling that out for perspective; keep in mind the pace was slower as well.      This is good times. But the past wasn't crap either. I think this might be the best time since those Dream Team days, but I'll give it another 20 years or so before I decide which was better."
Rudy Gobert enters the chat.
Rudy Gobert is the reincarnation of Hanamichi Sakuragi.
"Conley and oneale are plus defenders outside gobert and the rest are kinda ass - but we have the #1 defense in nba (garbage time removed) and give up the least 3s bc we have rudy hang back, allowing us to overcommit to the arc.   If a player gets beat off the dribble on the arc (which we are fine with and sometimes even allow on purpose), they run into rudy as a buzzsaw.  Tough matchup for the warriors play style wise"
yeah it's pretty sad. that stupid-ass no-call goaltend on Rudy Gobert Blazers v. Jazz last season comes to mind.... fucking nightmare watching that
"Oubre, Ja, Claxton, Nerlens Noel, Romeo Langford, DLo, Jordan Clarkson, Jamal Murray, Weley Matthews, Curry, James Wiseman Aaron Gordon, Fox, CP3, Lowry, Justise Winslow, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, PG13, Anfernee Simmons, Melo, there's a lot of cute guys"
"This is what I’m going to say about donavan he is the closest anyone is to being a superstar he is better than kyrie, devin, cp3, Simmons, and a lot other great players but he is not quite yet one but is super close if the jazz win this year then I’m going to call not just donavan but Rudy gobert a superstar too"
"I'm a big fan of Rudy Gobert (It feels weird to type that out). And, I think despite conventional wisdom, Jazz without Gobert would be a near lottery pick. He is at the heart of everything they do."
If it’s 20 million a year do it. If it’s 25 or 30 let him walk. He’s not Rudy Gobert and doesn’t deserve max money.
He did work against Rudy Gobert earlier this season when he was on the nets. I watched with my dad and we were both really impressed. (And at the time maybe a little concerned about Rudy lol)
But do the refs set elite screens like Rudy Gobert?
"I think they match up fairly well against both teams, but I'll save Utah for these reasons         1. Donovan Mitchell is going to be rusty missing all that time     2. Rudy Gobert is going to have a lot to deal with with the Lakers bigs         3. History, this is more of a LeBron thing but imagine if they get the 8th seed and get to the finals and maybe win a championship as the 8th seed, mother fuckers are going to have to avoid ESPN and FS1 for at least 3 months 🤣"
"I'm a Jazz fan &amp; Rudy Gobert is my favorite player.   This is an awesome rule &amp; if they gave it to Gobert, I'd be pissed for Myles Turner."
"Mitchell / Conley / Gobert / Ingles / Bogdanovic / O'Neale / Clarkson / Favors / Niang is our current 9-man lineup.  The Seattle native in me wants to say Mitchell is unprotected because I'd want my hometown team to draft my favorite player in the expansion, but obviously that's not going to happen unless he ends up a double amputee sometime soon so the real debate is O'Neale vs Favors vs Niang. Of the three, my gut says that Favors gets the boot as much as it pains me to say. He's been pretty bad this season and although he does occasionally have nice games, he's arguably the weakest point of the team (though most bigs backing up Rudy would look comparatively weak), and a passable screen setting rim rolling paint protector is easier to replace than an on-the rise 3&amp;D wing is."
Shawn Kemp &gt; Rudy Gobert
"He also had an insanely good supporting cast though. He had great guard defenders, prime Danny green who was historically good in transition defense. A young kawhi who wasn’t a super star yet but was still a great defender  Duncan was still great as an anchor but he wasn’t exactly Rudy gobert"
"So is everyone on board with Rudy Gobert, DPOY? Admittedly, I don't watch a lot of jazz basketball, but when I do I'm not seeing it. All the games I've seen have been nationally televised and he seems to get worked when he goes against good/great big men. Is he just a default choice?"
This isn’t a picture of Rudy Gobert
"Man, people really see what they want to see lol. It's clear delon had no intention of taking a 3, so that was never a real option. And Rudy was late on recovery if delon did attempt a 3 when he caught the pass from luka. Instead delon gets the pass, sees that gobert is trying to recover on him, and immediately goes for the layup. But that was a bad decision by delon as gobert was still too close to the basket. He should've baited him further out to the line, or faked the drive and pulled up for a 2. I'll give gobert credit for kinda forcing that bad decision.   To your last point, you act as if there aren't other players in the league who are improving their defensive games as well i.e. Simmons. Simmons is a better defender this year than gobert was when he won his last dpoy. Lol. Not saying gobert hasn't improved as well, but they both have decent arguments for dpoy."
It’s a smaller sample (only 12 votes) but so far Rudy Gobert is the unanimous DPOY. I’m also not 100% on this but looking through voting it seems like there’s never been a unanimous DPOY. Would be crazy to have the two biggest NBA awards be unanimous in the same year.
I mean impact is the whole case for Gobert DPOY and MVP to some people. Jazz have a top 5 defense and top defense based on some stats. Their second best defender is Royce O’Neale who is 6’4 and always guarding the opposing teams best guard/forwards.  We got two undersized guards in Mitch and Conley and then Bojan Bogdanovic.  That impact of Rudy Gobert carrying the defense is directly comparable to a superstar leading an offense and making players around him better.
"&gt; Not to mention defense isn't properly measured by defensive statistics, advanced or otherwise, so the people have little to fall back on.  Sometimes, but Gobert has a crazy statistical footprint. With Gobert on, the Jazz allow 103.8 points per 100 possessions, well better than the league-leading Lakers' 106.8. With Gobert off, the Jazz allow 116.2 points per 100, in the neighborhood of the league-worst Kings at 116.5. Royce O'Neale is probably the second-best defender on the Jazz, but [look how good they are with Gobert and no O'Neale](https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/advanced/?CF=GROUP_NAME*E*gobert:GROUP_NAME*NE*O%27Neale&amp;sort=MIN&amp;dir=1).  Jazz front office basically stuffed the roster with offensive players and trusted Rudy to carry the whole thing on defense, and now they're the best team in the league. Man's a beast."
"&gt; Randle was nowhere near bust status or having is NBA career in jeopardy, many Lakers fans wanted to keep him.  That is part of my point. Even he doesn't fit. Pretty much no one does.  &gt;It's an interesting point you make but players mocked that high don't constantly fail as hard as the Suns did even if it takes them going to another team.  But if it was because of the Suns failure to develop them, other teams should find tons of value swooping and picking up these young guys with star potential. Turns out they are pretty nonfactor on their teams no matter where they go and not anywhere close to being a star that many predicted before the Suns drafted them.  &gt;The Suns didn't reach but these guys failed spectacularly, there must be something the Suns were doing wrong in terms of player development that made them irredeemable.  If you got a coin and flip it 10 times it wont likely alternate heads then tails everytime. You are likely get a string of heads and/or a string of tails. It is a crapshoot. The Utah Jazz picked Kanter, Alec Burks, Trey Burke, Dante Exum, Trey Lyles to Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. This is also true accross sports, Seahawks had a string of historically great draft classes in the early 2010's to pretty bad recently in comparison. It often takes 1 or 2 players to chance an entire narrative of draft history and if 76ers never got Embiid, if Bucks never got Giannis, and if Kings got Doncic instead of Bagley, it would change entire prespectives."
Are draymond green/Rudy Gobert better defenders than Scottie pippen/Tim Duncan because they have DPOYS?
"Not only is he still playing but he does well in International competition. Despite the lack of coverage and poor turnouts for the 2019 FIBA World Cup a full strength Argentina was able to beat a full strength French Team in the semi finals, a game in which Luis Scola made Rudy Gobert look silly."
All I know is Rudy Gobert has stone hands
"Like... C'mon guys. No he could not have been DPOY. he's not even a good defender, let alone near Rudy Gobert level lol"
PREACH!! -Rudy Gobert
"I mean i'm a nuggets fan so i'm extremely biased towards Jokic as mvp, however that is not a controversial take so lets remove him from the conversation and instead look at the fucking monster that is Rudy Gobert. If Jokic didn't exist this man would be my MVP simply because he is a full on defensive system in and of himself and takes a team that is ranked 23rd on defense without him to no.1 with him on the court and that is just absurd impact. This combined with him being an ok offensive player (he doesn't try to do too much and with the great spacing the jazz have he can sit in the paint without it being an issue). He can be a problem on the glass against other teams this combined with the occasional extra pass and alley-oop makes him a positive on that end as well. So all in all Rudy Gobert is a spectacular player and if my Nuggets didn't have Jokic I would love for him to be on the team"
Considering you see Rudy Gobert (anyone even heard of this guy) second behind him in almost every award imo diminishes a lot of weirdly specific stats.   There’s not a legit argument you can make that Gobert had a better season than Steph or Giannis
"Rudy also plays five minutes less a game, which kinda blows that pace argument out of the water. The per36 and per100 stats are both even more biased in Rudy's favor.  The counting stats are no comparison, the advanced stats are no comparison, the eye test is no comparison. What even is the point you're trying to make? Do you think Gobert would be a better player if he took a bunch more bad shots? Rudy is just plain better than Noah was. Noah was a much better passer and had a more rounded offensive game, but his offensive game just wasn't very good. His production was on par with Taj Gibson and Tristan Thompson even in his best year. His passing was good, but great and definitely not anywhere near good enough to make the difference on offense comparable to the difference on defense."
"he has basically zero chance to actually win, which is fair.  but there hasnt been a lot of players that had a better season than rudy gobert"
"Gobert is second in pretty much every advanced impact metric (RAPTOR, EPM, LEBRON, RPM), and his defensive stats are [historically great](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/).  People just can't seem to accept that the best defensive player can have as much impact on defense as the best offensive players do on offense. Normally, the advanced metrics agree with that sentiment. But not this year."
So current Rudy Gobert vs CP3? Honestly that's a tough one

Rudy Gobert.
Can’t wait to see DPOY Rudy Gobert get smoked in the playoffs again this year
"This pretty closely matches the MVP candidates from each team.  It’s not really fair to value scoring above all else, but that’s usually the way it works.  Rudy Gobert might be the rare exception."
"""LeBron and AD has historically abused Rudy Gobert as if he is just another journeyman.""   Have they? I don't think the actual stats say what you think they say. They have had good games, but they haven't dominated the matchup. I don't think a Lebron James team beat the Jazz at home until last year. Rudy has a winning record head to head against AD, I'm pretty sure, depending on if Davis actually played in some of those Jazz wins."
"&gt;Most prolific alley-oop duo (credit to lactardenthusiast for the idea)  &gt;**Clint Capela &amp; Trae Young (69)**  &gt;Mike Conley &amp; Rudy Gobert (39)  &gt;DeAndre Jordan &amp; James Harden, **John Collins &amp; Trae Young (32)**  &gt;Deandre Ayton &amp; Devin Booker (31)  Damn! I watch the Hawks, and even I didn’t notice how many oops compared to the rest of the league that Trae connects on. There’s a new lob city now!"
I'd take either Joakim Gobert or Rudy Noah
"&gt;Hawks beat Knicks 4-2, creates a pro Trae Young circle jerk, Knicks fans are sad (I will be too  I like this  &gt;Lakers beat the Utah Jazz, 4-3: Entire front page is just shitting on Rudy Gobert, even though he averaged 13 rebounds and four blocks in the series  Subscribe-"
"Utah should pray that the Lakers win the play in, otherwise a cool season will end after five or six playoff games.  It's just an awful matchup, they have nothing for LeBron and AD has historically abused Rudy Gobert as if he is just another journeyman, also a second round series against the Clippers would be way more interesting due to matchups and nobody wanting to see the No.1 seed going home in the first round."
All I see is Rudy Gobert and Jokic lmao

No team led by donovan mitchell and rudy gobert will ever be contenders.
"Espn(Big Perk probably), Nick Wrong etc.  ""Hmmm, Gobert is DPOY by a small(not really) margin over Ben Simmons.""  Almost all other voters(except Andre Drummond guy) think in a similar way and huge majority vote for Rudy.   ""Wtf, disrepek Ben Simmons he should have gotten 40% of the votes, and lemme tell you why you wrong Max, let me aks you something"" Nba analysts btw"
"What does your ballot look like where Rudy isn't at least 3rd team like he has been the last few years?  Hell, with the fact that Jokic and Embiid could both end up on first team with one of them as a forward means there's a decent shot Rudy ends up making second-team.  I don't think anyone else on the team will make all-nba (if anyone does, i think mitchell will sneak onto the third team but being a guard right now is TOUGH), but i would be *shocked* if Gobert doesn't make an all-nba team."
"Ok, but didn't Rudy Gobert also win DPOY 2 years ago?"
"This is good, I can understand most of your picks but  what's your reasoning for picking Thybulle as the Defensive player of the year over someone like Rudy Gobert?"

This may be unpopular but I think Gobert is the Jazz's superstar. He’s currently having one of the best defensive seasons in modern NBA history.  Source: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/
Imagine thinking Rudy gobert is a more valuable player to a team than future first ballot HOFer Steph curry 😂
"Simmons is the second-best defender in the NBA and is DPOY every year for the next decade if Rudy Gobert doesn't exist.  OG is good, but it's really not that close."
"I saw him hit 2 jumpers near the elbow a game or two before they played the Heat. I'd like to see him do it more, but he's still an amazing player. He's 8th in steals and 12th in assists. He has a better 3pt % than Draymond Green AND gets more buckets than Dray.  He's one of, if not, the best defensive player in the NBA. If anyone jumps in here saying Rudy Gobert I swear to god I will smash the downvote button so hard my keyboard will break.  &amp;#x200B;  Yes 3 or 4 defenders were absolutely converging on him. I believe the Heat were running a zone D at the time.    &amp;#x200B;  I don't understand the Ben slander, but I do think '7ft Rondo' is a hilarious slander."
"If Rudy Gobert improved his offense, he would be the most complete player in the NBA."
all of the people who claim Rudy Gobert should make the HOF over Ben Wallace fit that description.
"There's now three players who got in solely because of their defense:  Dikembe Mutombo  Dennis Rodman  Ben Wallace  Really speaks well for Draymond Green's chances. I think Green will definitely get in.  I don't think Rudy Gobert will, though, unless he wins at least one ring."
"why is this bullshit upvoted so much? Gobert is in no way comparable to Ben Wallace in terms of impact on the court during their time.  If the Jazz never win a ring w/ Gobert then I would actually argue that Rudy won't get in, as he has a higher chance of getting forgotten as a result."
"For the last 5 years Definitely remembered: LeBron, Curry, Giannis, Durant, Klay, Davis, Lillard, Harden, Russ, CP3, Embiid, Kyrie, Wade, Kobe  Likely remembered: Jokic, Tatum, Korver, Griffin, Derrick Rose, Donovan Mitchell  Potentially forgotten: Jimmy Butler, Kemba, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Bradley Beal, Al Horford, Devin Booker  Likely forgotten: Lowry, Aldridge, Millsap, Kevin Love, Marc Gasol, Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall, Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert"
There's no doubt in my mind that Rudy Gobert will be a HOFer
GONNA BE HONEST. RUDY GOBERT IS THE MOST ELITE PLAYOFF FORCE OF ALL TIME. DONOVAN MITCHELL IS QUITE LITERALLY BETTER THAN KEVIN DURANT. IT’S NOT EVEN BECAUSE DONOVAN IS THAT GOOD. KEVIN DURANT IS JUST AN AWFUL PLAYER. UHHHH WHAT ELSE... FUCK YALL
If Rudy Gobert and the Jazz go on to smoke the Nets in the Finals similar to Pistons-Lakers 04 then I think he deserves it
Reminder that VORP and BPM think jokic has provided the same value on defense as Rudy Gobert. All those stats tell you is how good someones box scores are.
"Boiling down the MVP  to the “best offensive player” award is completely absurd. It’s given to the guy with the most overall impact on winning, which, given the nature of the sport of basketball, comes primarily from offense.  Look at Rudy Gobert, he’s far-and-away the best defensive player in the league but probably not a top-10 player in the league.   Ben may have those 4 DPOYs, but at the end of the day, he was a player with a short peak, who was probably not even a top-10 player for most of that peak.  I still think he deserved induction, but if he had had the same exact total impact but spread it out more evenly between offense and defense, I don’t think people would’ve been as upset about his delayed induction as they are now, which just doesn’t make any sense to me."
Happy Rudy Gobert noises intensify.
Rudy Gobert himself has had 40 on his head trying to guard AD.   Jokic guarding AD is a terrible matchup. Yes Jokic isn’t that bad of a defender anymore but AD is gonna eat him alive. That would be a far easier matchup than Ayton.
"Yeah I think in sports like baseball and basketball defense is a tricky subject. I'll preface this by saying I think Ben Wallace belongs in the Hall of Fame, but I'll also say I'm pretty sure most front offices/fans/stat nerds/whoever values offense over defense and sees a Top 10 offensive player as more important for a team than a Top 10 defensive player.   Honest question- is Rudy Gobert a Hall of Famer? He'll have a similar resume to Wallace by the time he retires probably, but was there a single year in the NBA where Gobert was one of the 10 best players?"
Maybe Rudy Gobert
"&gt; Lmaooo everything you just said takes minimal BALL SKILLS any 7’2 guys can rim run and set good screens  Ah yes, so the reason Gobert's lead / been near the top of total screens and screen assists is because there are so few 7 footers in the league.  Yup.  No other 7 footers in the league.  Just take the L, neph.    &gt; Rudy can’t CREATE offense for himself or his teammates.  Screen set -&gt; opening in defense -&gt; teammate gets good shot.  Sounds like creating offense to me,    Your a perfect example of why people who only look at numbers shouldn’t be allowed to talk about the game  &gt;So yes he can be “effective” on a really good team with ball handlers to create for him  Ah yes, because ball handlers are a rare resource and there are so many teams out there without ball handlers.    &gt;let’s say he went to a team like okc how many points you think he’s averaging you gotta be realistic.  So you argument now is if he went to a team that is actively tanking he'd have worse stats.  Jebus, this is dumb.    &gt;just don’t say he’s “good” at offense he’s effective on the team he plays on currently  Ah, yes.  I shouldn't say he's 'good' at offense.  I should say he's effective on offense.    [That's literally what I said.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nct9px/whos_the_worst_player_youd_be_content_with_as_a/gy70wxg/)  ""I'd add that I thought the myth that Gobert isn't effective on the offensive end was dead at this point.""  Like, two or three comments back.  I hope you're fucking trolling, because the alternative is just depressing.  He's not a shot creator outside of screening but he's absolutely a significant positive on offense.  As to whether or not he's good at offense, you're free to your own opinion, but smarter people than you think he is, and you clearly don't watch him play, so I'd argue that your opinion's kinda garbage."
"Royce O'neale's reaction to trying to sprint ahead of the play, hope to be the recipient of a pass, only to see Rudy fucking Gobert dribble behind the back and then pass it backwards for a backcourt violation is one of the funniest god damn things I've seen all season.  He doesn't even try to hide his disappointment in the slightest lmao."

"Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Luol Deng, Jayson Tatum and Rudy Gobert for the 2 or fewer allstar appearance players."
"&gt;All of Rudy’s basketball come of lobs and tip ins he has no post moves suspect touch around the rim and no jumper to speak of only reason you can says he’s “effective” cause he plays with guys who get him shots he’d be averaging 9ppg if he played for any other team  A.) Thanks, now I'll have a comment to point to next time someone talks bullshit about Gobert not being underrated anymore.    B.) For starters, he's an elite roll man and finisher at the rim.  That has a lot of value, and that alone means he's a positive on offense.      C.) NBA front offices aren't stupid.  The idea that other coaches wouldn't use one of the most lethal rim runners in the league as much as the Jazz do is moronic.      D.) He's one of the most active screeners in the league.  People meme screen assists, but it's a legit metric, and Gobert is vital to the Jazz offense.  For years, Gobert has been among the top 2-3 in total screens and screen assists (leading many years), and so much of our offense starts with Gobert screens.  Our GM has legit been saying for years that Gobert [is our most important offensive player.'](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26420295/rudy-gobert-season-most-underrated-offensive-weapon)      E.) Your a perfect example of why people who only look at numbers shouldn’t be allowed to talk about the game"
"well, youre wrong  if you want to win at basketball, having rudy gobert is one of the most important factors to that  its not like my opinion, its just, like, how it is"
"&gt;youre getting 4 omegaluls out of 5 here  I love him too, but Rudy isn't really a top 10 player.  And he's probably the only guy outside the top 10 I'd even consider as a franchise cornerstone.  So worst player.    &gt;gobert and 4 G-Leaguers probably is the 4th seed in the east  Nah, East is trash but it's not *that* trash.    They'd be like 6th seed lol"
rudy Gobert
"Rudy Gobert is 50+ blocks ahead of 2nd place this season. Blocks are down, but players are also picking shots more strategically."
That stat has Rudy Gobert as the 10th highest WS/48 so Rudy is the 10th best player of all time? There is more to the world then numbers.
Rudy Gobert is one dimensional and a hell of player - versatility is huge in this league right now but it's still a specialists league.
"Rudy Gobert isn't lauded as an offensive beast. Ayton is putting up similar stats to him in terms of efficient points and rebounds. This is great, but I think a lot of people who think he has been a revelation haven't paid attention to him. Ayton always has been someone who could put up 20 points with double digit rebounds and for these last two years, with good defense. I don't mind if it hits his efficiency a bit but he puts up way more points."
&gt; but I don't know how we decided Utah and the Suns are some sort of regular season frauds while the 76ers and Bucks are legit.  They don't have top-end talent.  Top-end talent wins in the NBA the vast majority of the time. The upside for them is that the Lakers are crushed by injuries and the Clippers have shown themselves to be dysfunctional as hell.  But no team led by Rudy Gobert/Donovan Mitchell is gonna get the benefit of the doubt until they prove it against real MVP-level guys.
I closed it immediately when I saw Rudy Gobert second lol. What a useless model they’ve built.
Rudy Gobert and his 1.74 points per shot is clearly a better scorer than both
"Define dunks and blocks, because that's all Rudy Gobert does, and no one thinks he's exciting lol."
Regular season and the playoffs aren’t the same thing. Your opponent isn’t scheming against you every night and defensive versatility isn’t as important. That’s what makes Rudy Gobert the best regular season defensive player while Anthony Davis is the best playoff defensive player.
"i know his role is very different from everyone else on this list and his boxscore like usual isn't super impressive next to some of these, but i feel rudy gobert deserves some attention, especially because of the dumb narrative that some people have about him getting played off the court in the playoffs. he's absolutely been utah's best player so far, even with how good mike conley has been  15.7pts, 14reb, 3.7blks 77ts%, 87efg% +/- of +32"
Rudy Gobert could stop PG and Kawhi from dominating the paint and the Clippers can go cold from 3
Mavericks play perimeter defense like they have Rudy Gobert on their team.
"***All-NBA 1st Team***      C: Nikola Jokic      F: Joel Embiid      F: Giannis Antetokounmpo      G: Luka Doncic      G: Steph Curry      ***All-NBA 2nd Team***      C: Rudy Gobert      F: Julius Randle      F: Zion Williamson      G: Damian Lillard      G: Chris Paul      ***All-NBA 3rd Team***      C: Bam Adebayo      F: Kawhi Leonard      F: LeBron James      G: Jimmy Butler      G: Paul George"
"Porzingas averages more points vs Gobert than he averages for his career. I also said it’s tough for Rudy if Porzingas is playing well, as in shooting well.   Kristaps wouldn’t win the matchup but it makes defense a lot harder on Rudy if he has to get to the 3 pt line on D."
Kd said he’s modeling his game after Rudy Gobert
"The Jazz had Rudy ""guard"" DFS in the regular season so that Gobert could be in position to protect the rim when needed. It worked fantastically in those games. I'm sure the Mavs would do some things to try to scrabble that up, but the Jazz are fantastic at putting together unconventional defensive game plans so that Rudy can be at the rim when needed on defense."
I mean if we ran Rudy/Conley pick N roll 30 times a game Gobert could probably average 30+ like Jokic and Embiid. He absolutely can be a scorer when needed. But that isn't what the Jazz want him to be.
You obviously don’t know anything about defense or Rudy Gobert. You’re the outlier for the overwhelmingly classy Grizz fanbase on these threads.
"You know you’d want Rudy on your team. Don’t lie. There’s nobody in the league that changes a teams offensive sets like he does. He’s also a huge part of the teams offensive success. He sets killer screens that open canyons for players to drive past and is the magnet in the middle that leads to one player always being wide open to take the uncontested three.   Per Hollinger (who speaks with some authority): “I’ve written before that Gobert is the most underrated player in the league; he’s been a top-five player this season by virtually every per-minute impact stat and, as with Jokic, has a huge minutes edge on nearly every other MVP contender. Gobert played 530 minutes more than Embiid — that’s 11 full games in a shortened season, which is just a massive headwind for Embiid to overcome.  Additionally, I don’t think enough is made of the fact that Utah’s entire system is built around Gobert at both ends, and it worked well enough for the Jazz to have the best record in the league. If that isn’t value, then what is?  I can understand the urge to vote Curry second, as he dragged a deeply flawed Warriors team to a winning record and potential playoff berth. His return to awesomeness was one of the year’s best stories, and it might have won him MVP in a different season. I happen to think Gobert’s play was a little more central to an important contender; reasonable people can disagree.”"
Rudy Gobert being played off the court in the playoffs…
The whole criticism on Gobert is that his drop coverage is elite during the regular season but starts to get exploited in a 7 game series by smart offensive teams with elite shot creators (which you find deep into the Playoffs.) Porzingis dragging him out to the 3 point line doesn’t really lead him to be punished by Rudy.
"Gobert doesnt remotely stop AD in their matchups. In fact Gobert really doesnt do well against elite big men. Jokic, Embid, and AD droped over 40 on him this season alone. Rudy does just fine against Jonas or zubac...but gets severely exposed by elite centers and PFs. Rudy is good defender dont get me wrong, but DPY is laughable to me."

The parent comment made by a ""Fake News"" Jazz fan ended up being deleted, but that same sentiment can be found all over that post(I just posted my specific comment thread b/c I could find it via reddit comment search). FWIW a lot of folks deleted their comments/accounts, so some of the wilder stuff may be gone.  I'm honestly not up for litigating that topic all over again, and going up against the ""Fake News"" tendencies of the Utah crowd again.  Hopefully my comments from that day breaking down how reporting works helps(local vs. national, biases on all sides, etc.).   Also seeing the general back and forth b/w Jazz fans and everybody else in that post gives you a snapshot of that time. FWIW I pointed out how a lot of Rox fans also leaned into the ""Fake News"" narrative(like many other fanbases) when bad news started trickling out about Tillman Frittata."
Rudy Gobert
Rudy Gobert?
Rudy Gobert is not even a star.
Rudy Gobert isn’t overrated. Not even slightly.
Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert are the most overrated players in the NBA.
&gt;guy averaging like 8/14 isn't going to get paid much  may I introduce you to one Rudy Gobert?
Pfffttt expecting the sub to have a brain is asking for too much.  1v1 defense is pretty much non existent in modern defenses anyways. 90% of the time you can call for a screen and get a switch. Like last night with Rudy Gobert.
"Dude, you're talking out of your ass and not even reading what I wrote. I'm saying gobert is the only person on our team worth a damn on defense, I never once acted like he was crushing the clippers. I was showing that he is actually playing good D contrary to what all the fools on this subreddit meme about. Please show me where they are targeting him with pick n rolls because I would love to see that especially when we have jordan Clarkson out there for 40 minutes. yeah I'm sure they are gonna try and specifically attack rudy over Clarkson, Ingles, and mitchell."
"For what it's worth, Rudy Gobert is an absolutely great player in the NBA. I think you are right in that he might be a slightly worse Gobert over a career in the NBA if he was playing now. But to be honest, there's a good chance Gobert does just end up being a better player all time. I mean, he has 3 dpoys, only one less than wallace. He's on a first seed this year and is perennially the 2nd best player on a pretty good team, if not first according to some people. Wallace had an amazing team, substantially better than the Jazz ever had with Gobert, so as a result, those pistons records are going to look much better. But I think if someone told me I could have Ben Wallace and he was going to be Rudy Gobert but as bad at offense as he was in his career, I'd say sign me up. Rudy Gobert exceptionally hampers opposing offenses every night, even if he isn't guarding their pg or something because of his impeccable rim protection. I think Wallace would be the same way, even in today's league. I do not think Simmons, at least as of now, has shown he can be in either of these two's league in defensive value.  &amp;#x200B;  Also, I am a die hard pistons fan, have been since 02. That 04 pistons team is what really catalyzed my love for the NBA, so in no way am I trying to deprecate Wallace's accomplishments or skills."
"His isolation defense has been great. Paul George and Kawhi cant do nothing on switches.   His 3 point defense is good only if he's already at the 3 point line. When he's running out to contest, or more importantly not running out cause he won't make it he's useless. This does not appear on the stat sheet because they won't be assigned to Gobert.   Stop making excuses for him. This is the modern nba, what separates him from other elite defenders is that they can fly around the court and make those extra rotations that Gobert cant.   It's a problem when you have a team like the Clippers who only miss open 3s based on luck.  And yes, I am well aware that Favors is 10x worse so you cant bench Rudy.  The Jazz have been exposed in way too many series now. Enough is enough. It's the same thing each time. Rudy is good on defense, but not matching his regular season impact. You cant bench him cause there is no replacement on the roster. And Jazz fans say it's the offensive not the defense that's the problem so you cant blame Rudy. Except you still can because his inability to punish small ball lineups means teams can switch everything and blow up their very basic offense and Rudy's inability to space the floor means the driving lanes aren't there for Mitchell and the rest of the team.   The same thing will happen next year and we'll have this same debate."
Ben Wallace wouldn’t be as successful in today’s NBA either my guy.  He’s be a slightly better/worse Rudy Gobert depending on who you’re playing.
Rudy Gobert and the team name for Zion (and call them the Utah Zions … or the Zion Mountains?) … who says no?
Rudy gets the blame for basically every other Jazz player being trash defensively. Even Royce is largely overrated.   In that sense the Jazz are huge frauds because Gobert can't mask the entire team's defensive incompetence the way he can in the regular season.
When teams go small he’s not taking and range because quite frankly it’s much easier to box out (group rebounding) on threes than it is when guys are driving the paint. The Clippers have figured it out. Get Rudy in the pick and roll. Play small. Group rebound. And let the Jazz take threes all game instead of driving into the paint.   There was a period in the fourth when Gobert was FEASTING on the offensive boards because they were driving inside. Making the Clippers pay for going small. Then they just… stopped. The Bucks have the same problem.
"so im guessing you think Rudy Gobert is one of the worst centers in the league cuz he can’t shoot, right?"
"Dallas - The Mavs have this kind of ""European"" culture; their historic team success has been brought by European players, like Dirk back then and Luka today. Their dream lineup would be:  PG - Luka Dončić  SG - Evan Fournier  SF - Giannis Antetokounmpo  PF - Nikola Jokić  C - Rudy Gobert"
"&gt;  Marcus Morris is still doing shit like stepping over Rudy Gobert  Which is staying mostly quiet compared to the shit he did last year.  &gt; PatBev is getting 15 mpg just to harass Mitchell  Compared to the 20.8 mpg he was getting last year, he's only getting 13.2 mpg this playoffs. It's very obvious even to the casual eyes that the Clippers just haven't given him much power to do anything this year, and that's a positive for those who hates Pat Bev.  Don't also forget that Harrell, who was also one of the guys who oozed negative news last year, left the Clippers.  I also mentioned them being somewhat underdogs."
They have Rudy 'hall of fame and top 7 player' Gobert so surely the Clippers haven't figured them out?
"Nah not really. Marcus Morris is still doing shit like stepping over Rudy Gobert and PatBev is getting 15 mpg just to harass Mitchell, the difference is now they're doing it as underdogs not under performing favorites."
"I haven’t watched the series so I can only speak to this particularly play. Gobert played great defense, but Mann made a helluva play, and he had to work really hard for it. I can’t fault Rudy."
"Rudy Gobert has been public enemy #1 in this sub for years. There are the stories of shitbag Jazz fans being racist to players. The stupid MJ documentary painted the Jazz as villains. There are all the horrible fuckface Laker fans (fuck the Lakers) who have a long history with the Jazz. Players like LeBron mocking Utah. Former players like Vernon Maxwell. Basically, in the eyes of r/nba, we are forever the bad guys. And to top it all off, we just never seem to be able to get things done when we really need to, like last night."
What does it even mean? We’re seeing Rudy Gobert getting cooked right now and he’s a 3x DPOY.
Rudy gobert has attempted more shots outside the paint in the second round (2) than Simmons (0)

"Honestly, although he wasn't even close to acceptable tonight, the reason why they lost was because of the lack of adaptability in roster and defensive game planning. Rudy Gobert plugs a lot of holes for Jazz players who can't contain for shit on the perimeter, or even provide help rim protection. He's always existed on an island and the Jazz are where they are despite that.  Regardless, if they put all their chips on him standing in the paint and other teams 5th man missing open 3s, they're going to get burned a lot. It's the playoffs, and outliers become a regular occurrence in big moments. Now if Gobert chases perimeter players, what does the Jazz actually have in rim protection? Is Bogdanovic going to slide in? Do they play Favors as a 4, have 2 non shooters on offense and 2 slower bigs rotating in the half court? If they take Gobert off the court, are the rest of the Jazz players going to step up and not hide behind Gobert's rim protection? I saw Donovan Mitchell get bullied by Reggie Jackson in an iso, that would become a regular occurrence.  Jazz are locked into a player who plugs too many holes on defense and can easily be jump shot into oblivion. The only 3 options going forward are a) hope to god small teams just miss their jump shots all the way to a chip b) get some new creativity in defensive coaching with or without Quinn and c) trade Gobert to make an adaptable roster and risk having all the Jazz perimeter players exposed on defense."
"On the positive side, I'd have to say Trae. If he goes to a conference finals before Luca wins a playoff series, that's a major jump from even this season when some were claiming the hawks were better without him.  Terance Mann! He didn't get 10 minutes in the two losses to Utah, and now you can count him for 25 mins and 12 pts with upside.  On the negative end, I'm looking at Rudy Gobert. I guess I could say Snyder, but one of those two needs to be blamed for why they can't switch to contain the 3 in those last two games. But Rudy goes from 3 time DPOY to hunted in a week?  Philly could still win and we'll forget it, but if they lose, it's almost certainly going to include a terrible Ben Simmons fourth quarter and a lot of talk about what to do."
"I mean, yeah, he’s easily the best paint defender in the league during the regular season, but even then I believe the DPOY should be rated on defensive versatility instead of solely one facet of defense.   Like, Rudy had been exposed in the playoffs 3 times now, this year ending his postseason as a **literal defensive liability ** for the last two games. Put Draymond, Myles Turner, Bam in his position and this series is probably over in 5, especially without Kawhi.   Again, Gobert was definitely one of the 3-4 deserving players to get the award in the regular season, but that’s about it."
Seems like it with how much you're bringing Rudy gobert up
"Watch literally one game ago and you see him guard 1-5s... okay, 1-3s cause I refuse to call Batum even a PF fine. The Clippers never went one on one on him, they went one on one with everyone else on the Jazz that Rudy had to cover for.   You’re trying to shit on Gobert and I’m now sure you didn’t watch anything that happened this series."
Rudy Gobert is an elite regular season defensive player. Rudy Gobert in the playoffs is a defensive player who is very easy to gameplan against because he can’t dominate on the offensive end against small ball. Him being a bad playoff player doesn’t change how good he is in the regular season.
This is literally all the jazz had to do. You can leave someone open in the corner if your other defenders ROTATE and close out. People are just obsessed with Rudy Gobert    https://youtu.be/WJtyKyrcUV0
"How come Gobert is the only one getting the defensive blame here? Like you said in your post, the issue is that no one on the perimeter is containing the ball at the point of attack. Rudy could leave the rim and guard on the perimeter but if a man beats his primary defender and is driving to the rim you’re already in pick your poison scenario."
Rudy Gobert is going to be the worst contract before it’s over
"As a brokenhearted Jazz fan right now, I appreciate this post. Gobert desperately needs to develop an offensive game, but you're right that our defensive system basically is... him. He was inconsistent this whole series but he was also asked to guard both the perimeter and the paint (with a coach who for some damned reason refuses to make the slightest in game adjustment). I wanted to kill Rudy watching him tonight but it's more on our coaching than him, I think."
So then why is he responsible for other people sucking at their jobs? Superstars get the praise when it works and the blame when it doesn't but Rudy really only gets the blame. Mitchell gets the credit. There is no player in the NBA who could come even remotely close to doing what you guys seem to expect Gobert to do. You cannot physically contest the perimeter and simultaneously cover for the defensive lapses of your teammates at the rim. When your teammates can't stay in front of your man you give up either layups or threes and everyone agrees that if you have to pick one you give up threes.
"I know we’re all a little lathered up from this game,  but this is an INSANE take, and everyone agreeing with you should be ashamed of themselves. Even if “playing his way into shape Shaq” from 2001 would be completely unable to rotate out to perimeter shooters, the defense would be constructed around that weakness. Gobert, on the other hand, has the speed and footwork to step out if needed, so Utah has a defense that pins him as a rim protector, but doesn’t fight switches, so he feasts when everything keeps moving toward the basket, but the whole scheme falls apart if he’s targeted.  Meanwhile, in offenseland — WHO THE FUCK IS GUARDING SHAQ? Batum who had a lot of time on his hands in Charlotte so he watched some tape of prime Draymond and now he’s a small ball big? Zubac? Maybe Marcus Morris can step on his foot! Rudy dropped 12 tonight, do you think the Jazz would trade it for 56/21/7/5 from The Big Aristotle?"
"I didn't realize Gobert was responsible for Clippers going 20/39, 20/54, and 19/36 from the perimeter in the past 3 games. You casuals really are goofy picking on the easy target.   Rudy didn't do his job but the Jazz perimeter players literally don't think it's in their job description to play defense. Between Mitchell, Clarkson, Bogie, and Conley, you've got exactly one 35 year old 6-footer trying on defense and nothing else."
&gt;Bruh do you think I'm Rudy gobert?  lmao. You think I thought you're Rudy? LMAO. You're delusional.
"Gobert gets destroyed here whenever he has a rough game, Giannis has been one of the Golden boys on this sub for multiple years and has gotten more love than gobert ever will on this sub. Also giannis won 2 fuckin MVPs and then his team choked in the playoffs, Rudy gobert is not out here winning b2b MVPs and a dpoty, the criticism of Giannis is warranted because the bar for him is much higher, dude was the absolute golden boy of the media for multiple seasons before he started getting actual Shit for his disappointments. Gobert is one of the most shit on players in this sub when he doesn’t play well."
Bruh do you think I'm Rudy gobert? Or related to him? Or even a jazz fan? Lmao I just hate the clippers and will sleep like a baby knowing they lost kawhi for the next rounds. GG EZ
"So, to me the ""obvious"" solution is get Rudy involved in offense. He's not exactly a post machine but there's 0 chance that Mann or Beverly can consistently stop him from just dunking over them. Now, part of that is because of Rudy's biggest weakness. He has a tendency to sulk when he gets frozen out of what he thinks are easy baskets. He's a great team player and doesn't demand touches like Drummond does but when he gets nothing at all in offense his defensive production drops. It's by far the biggest criticism of him as a player by anyone who pays attention.  Giving Gobert the ball even a few times when he's guarded by Mann sidesteps a bunch of our issues. The Clippers switched so readily because they knew we weren't going to give Rudy the ball. In games one and two we threw him a few lobs and that opened up enough room to work for the rest of the team, if we'd even slightly exploited the mismatch then I think we don't struggle quite as much getting good looks in the second half.  I'd also like to have seen us play small when Rudy sits. Favors had all the same issues as Rudy without any of the positives and if there was ever a time to try and see how we'd do as a small lineup it was when Gobert was on the bench.  I'd liked to have seen us abandon the Zone defense we were running. That straight up does not work when the other team is shooting well and definitely contributed to the wide open shots the Clippers were getting.  I'm definitely not letting Rudy off the hook for his lack of aggressiveness, but it's a known quantity that we should have had a plan to deal with. It's kinda pathetic in a vacuum but most players play worse when they're getting frozen out, getting to score sometimes keeps people's energy up.  So if I'm Snyder? Keep Gobert involved on offense to keep his mental solid, give Ingles a shock collar that zaps him any time he passes up an open shot, drop the zone defense and just glue each Jazz player to their assignment, attack the mismatches off Clippers switches and pray to God that we can make passes to the open man without racking up turnovers."
I’ve told Sixers fans for years that Ben Simmons will hold them back from a championship. They’ve called me a mad man and refused to believe it. Jazz fans… y’all will not win a championship while paying Rudy Gobert 200+ million dollars. It’ll be even tougher once Donovan is on his max deal too.
petition for Rudy Gobert to not get fucking DPOY again dude was bbq chicken on defense
"i think Kawhi’s absence doesn’t hurt us that much offensively, we got so much firepower and offensive schemes that aren’t dependent on Kawhi so we can still get a lot of points without him.  But defensively he is very important, especially with the small ball line-up. He was the one boxing out Gobert and Rudy got a few put backs and tap ins when Kawhi was gone."
Goat Defender Rudy Gobert could make any small guy the MvP of the League just leaving him 10ft of space to freely shots.
From a Jazz fan I’m starting to realize why so many people hate on Rudy Gobert. Dude is mad overrated when it comes to big playoff games. He’s an all star level player in the regular season but nowhere near a star in the playoffs
Who would have been more useful this series? Rudy Gobert or “confirmed bust” Andrew Wiggins?
"This is not a Gobert problem, it's a personal problem. Name a good perimeter defender on the Jazz that isn't O'Neil. Take Rudy out of the game and who are you replacing him with? Time for the front office to upgrade the roster."
"Who does he put in if he takes Rudy Gobert out? Favors or O’Neale, they would’ve gotten eaten up too"
Can someone dumb down why this criticism I see everywhere right now is fair?  Isn’t Rudy a DPOY primarily on the basis of his insane and elite effectiveness defending the paint? He’s an interior defense specialist.   Totally agree he was exposed in his role as a perimeter defender but shouldn’t the coach be game planning to prevent gobert being on the perimeter at all? Or is that just impossible with all the switching that happens on defense in the modern nba?
"Lmao  ""Gobert is literally the best player in the NBA at many crucial skillsets that are critical to winning basketball games.  Donovan Mitchell is NOT the best player in the NBA at ANY crucial skillset, critical to winning basketball games.  Rudy Gobert is the best BASKETBALL player on the Jazz""  Good take very smart Jazz fan lol 👍 they just read more advanced stats gg man we never had a chance against their superior knowledge"
jazz fans be disrespecting Mitchell just to prop up Rudy “best player of the team” gobert
Rudy Gobert that how. Dude should give back his DPOY trophy.
Not post game reactions. We've seen 4 games straight games where the Clippers could go small the entire game and it only works because Rudy Gobert has zero offensive game.
Two words:  Rudy Gobert.
Clippers hitting a ton of corner threes? That's Rudy Gobert.
Rudy Gobert should return his DPOY trophy dude was pathetic.
"Ahh yes, three point *savant,* Rudy Gobert"
Reggie Jackson punked Rudy gobert for like the last three games of this series. Wasn't afraid to challenge him at all. Made it look super easy even compared to kawhi and PG challenging rudy.
AHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA RUDY GOBERT YOUR BEST PLAYER LOLLLLLL WTF U TALKING ABT WRONGO
"This. EVERYONE who understands basketball knows Rudy is going to leave his defender wide open for three. Only few teams have the personnel to exploit this. Clippers are one of those teams. As soon as Mann started hitting those shots Gobert needed to sit. This isn’t a knock on Gobert, this is understanding who he is as a player and in which contexts he is great. In defense on the Jazz. Beverly hitting those three threes makes absolutely no sense."
"Everyone is believing in ~~Pulling Rudy Gobert~~ science now, what happened to believing in God's grace?"
RuDy gOBeRt GaURds aLl 5 PoSItionS!!!
Never i have imagine a Rudy Gobert is gonna be a defensive liability for the Utah Jazz created in my brain. If Rudy has a single low post move/threat to counter the Clippers small ball it could be a different outcome. This is not even the GSW elite small level.
"Rudy gobert on offense is pretty horrendous. Dude has such butter fingers, and no ability to finish around the rim unless it's an alley oop."
My 5'4 nephew could've played better than Rudy Gobert tonight
Rudy Gobert
"As Wikipedia says, Terrence Mann is the father to Rudy Gobert."
"Donovan was the best player in the entire series by a long shot....don't even mention choke with his name in the same sentence.   Rudy Gobert got played off the floor, per usual...except Quin didn't take him off the floor."
"Rudy Gobert can’t do anything against him, and I’m not even talking about him taking Gobert out of the paint and out of his comfort zone.  no, he’ll attack the paint with Gobert protecting the rim and then finish with a lay up above him insane.  HOF Giant Slayer"
I did not see the DPOY of Rudy Gobert the whole entire series dude really went a-wall
Conclusions:  - Utah's regular season defense is a total gimmick that gets exposed like clockwork in the playoffs - Rudy Gobert is their only good defensive player - Even he's a liability against small ball units - Draymond Green was 100% right about him - Quin Snyder is a terrible coach that gets a long leash because he's white and looks psychotic - Mitchell should ask for a trade sooner than later  I had the Clips in 5 and only gave a Jazz a shot if Kawhi got hurt. He did and they still fucking suck.
"Big market Utah, loved by the media, especially Rudy Gobert and Jordan Clarkson."
"I’d pay to watch a 1 on 1 between Ben Simmons and Rudy Gobert. And yes, I like to suffer."
"Rudy has plenty of bad match ups. Would have been the same with the mavericks. Nuggets would just be Nikola dominating him as he usually does. The Sun's would be a more favorable match up for Gobert, but not by much, too much mid range."
"It's Gobert's fault because people are reactionary dumbasses. I'll take my chances that the Clippers won't shoot over 50% from 3 rather than just give them a layup every single possession. Yeah, we lost. We got beat like a stepchild in a fairy tale, but taking out Rudy would have been even worse. People are going to have their fun though, and we get another year of idiots parroting the ""Gobert can't play in the playoffs"" takes. He gets only the bad parts of the superstar treatment without any of the respect."
It’s officially official. Nothing can convince me otherwise.   Rudy Gobert is the biggest fraud in NBA history. Defensive player of the year my ass. #PandemicGobertExposed
Rudy Gobert 5 year $205 million deal comes with perks and jerks. People hate the fact he gets paid superstar money when he’s a glorified role player. He gets awards like DPOY. What Defense did the Jazz play?
Rudy Gobert was called a baller Dum Dum Dum Dum Dum  He fooled the whole league Dum Dum Dum Dum Dum
"It’s Ben Simmons on offense and it’s not close. Rudy Gobert has and is just so incredibly overrated, but Ben Simmons is a constant offensive liability"
Rudy aleast Ben could pass and defend the perimeter  Gobert is legitimately useless out there
"I basically said this in another threat, but having Rudy as your only defensive system can't work against teams like the Clippers. Without good enough perimeter defense, Gobert is trapped in the paint creating open three pointers elsewhere."
"Rudy gonna get shit on when it's mostly on the system and the atrocious perimeter defense of the Jazz. The defensive scheme was highly flawed against this Clippers offense. Gambling on the clippers not finding the open man or missing threes was just not it.  The Jazz perimeter players are way too reliant on having Gobert. They literally get blown by on every single posession. If you actually watched what happened then you could see that if Gobert didn't help on drives it would have been an open layup 9 out of 10 times.  If the Jazz rely that much on Gobert helping then they should at least rotate to his man when he has to help in the paint. At least make them make a second or third pass. But instead, they just expect him to rotate back and forth by himself. And all people see is that he left his man and didn't recover when it is mostly up to the other players to either help the helper or not get blown by every single time down the court."
"Doc pulled out Simmons when the Hawks were hacking him  Ty Lue put Shmurda in the starting lineup  Quin kept Gobert in there even if the 5-out offense was giving Rudy's man an open shot every time  You gotta give yourself a chance to win. Having Rudy in there whose main function is to get offensive boards and defend the interior.  Problem is that the Clips are a perimeter team. No reason why you lose a decider to a team missing their best player, and their 2nd best player struggling from the field...and you were up by 20."
"So Rudy gobert looking like a liability, how many open 3s did the clippers get with him not pressuring defender on the side?  Boy, jazz proved they were who we thought they were.  Mitchell is special though, Mitchell and Zion to the Knicks 2024 lolol??"
Pat Bev rn  *”Rudy Gobert trick yall. Standing around not defending corner 3’s* 🤣
I don’t think I could have watched Rudy Gobert shuffle out slowly to the 3PT line to close out on an open shooter for another game
"Rudy gobert sure does have a lot of teams that are his worst matchup lol. Got abused by harden, then jokic and now the clips."
Rudy Gobert trick y’all man
Trade Rudy Gobert for Kristaps Porkfingers and live with the results   That is the funniest thing to do
They’ll have to fire Quin Snyder to hire Carlisle and trade Rudy Gobert for a superstar
"Bogi at the five doesn't let us guard anything. We have literally 3 positive defensive players on the roster in total, Gobert, Favors and O'Neale.  Yeah, we should have taken Rudy out and tried something else just to say that we did but we weren't defending shit regardless. None of Bogey, Ingles, Clarkson, Niang, or injured Mitchell/Conley are staying in front of their man. We just got beat. Mann averaged like 7 points a game this playoffs and had more games scoreless than he did scoring double digits. Then he scored 20 points in the 3rd quarter alone and got 39 in total.  That's utter insanity."
Rudy Gobert?   Defensive player of the year?  More like Rudy GOGURT
"This is exactly it. Even Jazz fans are lambasting Rudy right now, but he never was the problem truthfully. They don't have a single noticeably good perimeter defender besides maybe Royce O'neal, and he can't guard quick/shifty guys like PG or Reggie Jackson. Funneling guys into Gobert is essentially their entire defensive scheme, but due to the lackluster defenders and the Clippers going small,  Gobert's assignment just camped out at the corner 3 and the entire scheme got blown up repeatedly."
Billionaires will make you feel bad about wasting money on avocado toast but spend 200 million dollars on Rudy Gobert
"Rudy Gobert, the DPOY, was the reason the defence looked so bad"
"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills with this a bit. Jazz perimeter player gets blown by, Gobert comes to help, ball gets kicked to Rudy's man for the 3.   I feel like either the first player has to not get beat, or if they do they need to go pick up the open man once Rudy rotates to cover. People expecting Rudy to pick someone up at the rim and then teleport out to the 3 pt line?"
Rudy Gobert more like Rudy Go learn how to not suck in the playoffs
Reddit is being meaner to Rudy Gobert than Shaquille O’Neal.
"&gt;Mitchell is not a superstar unless you have 20 superstars in the league.  I don't like the dude at all, but he's tough. You are actually surprised if he doesn't score 30+ in the playoffs..that warrants the superstar label for me.  &gt;Gobert is not a star unless you consider a player known almost exclusively for his defensive ability that can't defend more than 8ft from the rim a star.  Now that's something I can get behind. Although it seems like it's more scheme than anything. Idk, Embiid guards the perimeter ofc, but still protects the rim, there's gotta be a way for Rudy to still protect the rim without leaving shooters open every time.  &gt;Philadelphia 76ers.  Now what did we do to you 😔"
No one respects Rudy Gobert in the playoffs. Everyone went at him.
"Defensive liability of the year, Rudy Gobert"
All season long people were saying that Rudy gobert was the jazz best player and not Donovan Mitchell.... I just never saw it
/r/nba to Rudy Gobert in the playoffs: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man.
"&gt; I'm fully aware that Rudy is probably one of the greatest defenders ever just based on the accolades. But holy shit how many open 3's can you give up to the hottest fucking person on the court? Insanity. The Jazz deserved to lose, that was insulting defense and Mann took it personally.  I blame Snyder's defensive scheme. They were more or less running a ""zone"" with Gobert sticking to the paint, so when the Clippers passed to the open man in the corner, Gobert has to make a choice whether to protect the paint or close out. With how big and slow he is, Gobert gives the shooter a lot of time to decide whether or not to shoot or pass to a cutter to the basket.   The defensive scheme clearly didn't work but Snyder didn't change it up."
"""Rudy Gobert"" the next ""Roy Hibbert"""
Rudy Gobert got absolutely abused in the 2nd half. I get why you can't take out your best defender but Snyder had to try something against the 5 out offense the Clippers were running. Instead the Jazz drop coverage scheme allowed the Clippers to drive and kick at will for wide open 3s
"Rudy just isn't it man. Guy is soft as 1,000 count sateen sheets. I feel bad for Mitchell and the rest of those guys because they're super high effort, talented, and gritty dudes. Gobert brings them down."
Rudy gobert is the most overrated dpoy. U can’t be tied 2nd most all time and get exposed like that.
no team with rudy gobert as their 2nd best player is ever winning anything when it matters
"Great game but all Clippers tonight, especially Rudy Gobert."
"Rudy Gobert is so scared of ruining his DPOY image, he refused to leave the paint and just gave up open corner 3 after open corner 3. Just completely pathetic"
Somewhere out there in a parallel universe Rudy Gobert is still watching Mann take open threes.
You cannot be a successful playoff team paying Rudy Gobert that much money
"all the downvotes and hate I got only ended up with me being right. Rudy Gobert is the most overrated player in the league, and the worst player to ever win DPOY"
&gt;25 pt comeback  &gt;Rudy Gobert is a -24  Oh its gonna be that type of offseason
"I don’t believe in Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert, to be honest. Too many defensive liabilities due to both of their respective sizes. Mitchell can at least negate him being a 6’1”, shooting guard with STREAKY monster offensive production and being able to create his own shot. Gobert is literally only situationally advantageous aka a regular season rim protection god."
It is unclear to me whether this is on Quin or if this is the ceiling of team whose second best player is Rudy Gobert.
I can't fucking believe I was ever on the Rudy Gobert is out best player/Quin is COTY train. What a fucking embarrassment.
"He was awful in the second half tn. Playing favors at all was dumb, shouldve tried Niang or Ersan at center for a bit, not like you have to totally take Rudy.  Also the Jazz lack of perimeter defenders was shown here too. Besides Royce, Mitchell Conley(off a hammy) Clarkson Ingles are all pretty meh. But it's partly game planning they're so used to funneling people to Gobert when he's not there and parked on a shooter its tough.   Also no zone mixed in?? At least then when the 3s come off Rudy is newe the paint."
RUDY GOBERT GOT HIS ASS SAUTEED INTO RATATOUILLE
&gt;Rudy Gobert  More like Macaron McGee in the playoffs
Every year we have to hear why Rudy Gobert is DPOY and dude can't do anything vs small ball
rudy gobert need to go. he a big reason they blew the lead
"Lol sounds exactly like how jazz fans describe Rudy Gobert, which makes sense since Ayton himself said he’s been modeling his game after Rudy and Bam."
Rudy Gobert &gt; Donovan Mitchell
I can't wait for Rudy Gobert to average 18/14/4.1 blocks per game on 75% shooting to win FMVP and take the best player in the world title.
Rudy Gobert is pretty infamous.
It will be a disgrace to basketball if Rudy Gobert even touched the Larry O'Brien trophy. I hope that one of these teams prevents that from happening.
Rudy Gobert wants his trophy back
Would a single finals MVP for donovan mitchell or rudy gobert this year be enough to make them the Jazz franchise GOAT?
"We've seen so many bigs shy away from contact and avoid hard screens/rolls. Which is fair, even, because bigs in the NBA get mauled and you have to be aware of wear-and-tear when you're that damn big.  Meanwhile Rudy Gobert is going hard towards the rim and consistently contesting dunks. Dude's a damn beast."
"I think it is a lot more players than people think.  Look at some of the players on here [for example](https://www.espn.com/basketball/story/_/id/30482938/ranking-best-nba-players-2020-21-50-11). I think there are over 20 players that can be the best player on the team and still win it all if the rest of the team is really good as well. If you have a team like Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert for example I think that team can win it all."
"First possession as a Net KP post up Rudy Gobert hits him with a mean drop step, hits a clean baby hook then looks directly into the camera."
"I carefully have specified ""defense only star"". These guys are all elite two way players, meaning that they are elite on both ends of the floor. None of these guys are even close to being just ""decent"" on offense, like Rudy Gobert is. They all range from elite to generational on offense. If you take away any of these guys offense, they either don't win the chip or aren't the best player on their team anymore."
yeah the jazz arent really a defensive lineup. we start bojan bogdanovic as a power forward.  its just that we have rudy gobert and hes that good
"That you ignore all the statistics that say Gobert is top 3 in favor of one that says he's 13th in the League just means you like to cherry-pick your data.    That being said, there's nothing that will indicate that individual defense is just as impactful as individual offense in a playoff game other than the performances themselves.  Rudy has been disappointing in some playoff series, particularly against Harden and the Rockets.  We'll let the games go and see if the Jazz can validate their regular season performance with a deep playoff run and earn some respect for defensive performances.    With respect to trades, I'm pretty sure the Jazz would give a hard pass to trading Rudy for guys on the downside of their career like Curry, Lillard, and LeBron.  They'd also pass on guys with troublesome injury history like AD and Embiid. And they'd definitely pass on guys who would have no loyalty to the franchise like a Kawhi, KD, or Harden, since they'd leave ASAP."
"Not liking other teams? Sure.    Calling Ben a dirty bitch ehhhh. Kind of a stretch lol. He was a finalist for DPOY , saying he has 60 pounds on trae like that’s a knock against him is the dumbest thing I’ve heard.   Rudy Gobert has what, a foot over point guards? Why is he getting credit for blocking shots. Guys a straight up bitch. See how dumb that sounds lol."
"Rudy Gobert is 9th in win shares, apparently harden didn't even appear in one of your stats, and lonzo ball is 10th in box plus minus. Players that had good seasons have had low bpm. You can list all the advanced stats you want but they're flawed one way or another. Harden is one of the best floor generals in the league, locked in on d this playoffs, and the 2nd best scorer in the league. We've seen him carry trash teams to the playoffs with his historic combination of scoring and playmaking, if curry is better in every single way, like the stats say, he couldn't make it to the playoffs with a #5 defense around him?"
"&gt;how good Rudy is offensively  He is way more important offensively than people give him credit for--and that's with only really one elite skill: screen setting.  I get that he doesn't have the post moves that Jokic or Embiid have and that's probably why people discount his offense--because when he scores it's not Rudy being a crazy offensive threat. It's the team offense working really well to seize the opportunity.  And that's honestly not an unfair take.  Depending on how you count it, Derrick Favor's ORtg is as good or better than Gobert's.  I think there are plenty of centers in the league today that if you swapped for Gobert, Jazz offense improves. But that's not the same as saying he's an offensive liability like the narrative has been in years past."
"I'm honestly shook that you're trying to argue that Gobert is better than any of these guys but I guess I'll bite since I'm bored  &gt; Gobert is top 3 in WS, estimated plus/minus, and RAPTOR WAR.  And he's nothing more than a low tier all star by BPM, which is generally considered to be one of the best advanced stats in terms of predicting team/player success. Advanced stats often don't agree with each other, which is why I have a hard time trusting them   &gt; But the best ability is availability  No it's not, I'd take an injury prone superstar over an iron man all star any day for the chance at a chip  &gt; And Gobert provides way more on offense than net negative defenders  Individual offense is DRAMATICALLY more impactful than individual defense in today's league, even for rim protectors. Rudy's playoff struggles are overstated but he still can be neutralized to a certain degree by certain schemes/matchups.   &gt;  Gobert is the best defender in the league and is a net positive dunker and screener on offense.  So he's a solid role player on offense, which strongly limits his ability to carry his team if needed, which is something that all of those other players are capable of doing, even if just for a game or two. Bad defenders, particularly at the guard positions, can be hidden on defense to a certain degree.  I can guarantee that the Jazz would swap Rudy with any of those guys in a heartbeat, and that they'd get way better instantly. Rudy has not proven to be in the same league as any of those guys unless you only look at the specific advanced stats that like him, and ignore results/actually watching games."
Rudy Gobert &gt; Paul george
“The Clippers have the two best players in the series”. Are you seriously trying to tell me that Paul George is better than Rudy Gobert?
Rudy Gobert catching the ball within 3 feet of the basket is the most efficient outcome for the Jazz offense. Rudy's gravity around the rim is the reason why the Jazz get so many wide open 3 point attempts.
"that's because he's an opportunist at the rim. go compare his and Lebron's usage. If you honestly thin, he's an elite finisher on Lebron's level, he should be driving to the rim every possession and take over games like Lebron. He doesn't, he can't. That's like saying fucking Rudy Gobert is an elite finisher - yeah, but only on certain types of shots."
"Adam Silver too, he’d probably retire if he had to shake hands with Rudy Gobert as the finals mvp."
I’d stop watching the NBA for good if Rudy Gobert seriously won back to back championships
"Rudy Gobert is about to do it, you can count on it."
He's not. Rudy Gobert is easily better.
"&gt;Couldnt tell you, saw it earlier in the year on this sub.  So, you once again can't provide evidence.  &gt;Just looking at some stats now, and devonte graham is 24th in defensive win shares. Rudy gobert is 9th in win shares for the whole league. Nikola vucevic is 14th in player impact estimate. Hmmm stats seem very telling, wouldn't you agree?     So when a stat disagrees with you, it's good. When a stat agrees with you, it's bad. Maybe, your eye test isn't accurate and with context, box score, advanced stats and unbiased eye tests all put together, we can piece together a more accurate image?  Nope, your eye test is above all."
"Couldnt tell you, saw it earlier in the year on this sub.   Just looking at some stats now, and devonte graham is 24th in defensive win shares. Rudy gobert is 9th in win shares for the whole league. Nikola vucevic is 14th in player impact estimate. Hmmm stats seem very telling, wouldn't you agree?"
"I mean the Mavericks had an old Jason Kidd. Plus, Dirk &gt; Mitchell + Conley. And Tyson Chandler can be the Rudy Gobert ig lol"
Where do we find one of these Centers you speak of?  I see Rudy Gobert and then the next step down is like….Nerlen’s Noel.
Rudy Gobert
"Keep sleeping on Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, not being included in honorable mentions even on these lists. Just go watch the highlights from both of true analysts who study the game on YouTube and not entertainment analysts who say what you want to hear or what you don’t to troll for clickbait. The True number one seed that struggled just like the lakers at times when either weren’t on the court."
"Frank Ntilikina, Rudy Gobert, Boris Diaw, Evan Fournier, Mickael Pietrus, Rodrigue Beaubois, Nando De Colo, etc"
rudy gobert is definitely the final evolution
Rudy Gobert is better than Paul George.
Rudy Gobert is the final form.
"I'm not homering you just exaggerated and are trying to extrapolate something from an incredibly small sample size lol. It's fine we'll see if this is the smoking gun in this series. Jazz fans have heard so often how ""Gobert was run off the floor and exposed"" and it just rarely was accurate.  You are again bullshitting about AD and Jokic who both historically play about average against Gobert. Jokic has had some amazing shooting games against him recently but that is just him making tough contested shots all night.  His career numbers are good but not great against Rudy.  AD's career averages against Gobert are nothing special. He's had some good and many bad games against Rudy.   The Jazz struggle with PnR in two scenarios that any team struggles. The first is if the ball handler is a very efficient midrange scorer, the second is if the big is a good rim runner. The Jazz generally rely on Rudy to guard both the ball handler and the big at the same time and stay home on shooters. So him getting ""cooked"" is just the Jazz asking him to put himself in a 2 on 1 over and over again because statistically it is a better option than the other ones.  You don't even know what the hell you are talking about with side PnR lol. That's one of Rudy's extreme strengths. He's probably the best PnR big in the world defensively. He's asked to do a ton and makes life really difficult for offenses. Have a good evening."
"Were Rudy Gobert or Draymond Green drafted #1 overall with “generational talent”, LeBron comparisons out of the gate.   The criticism for Ben is harsher because he has more potential, higher expectations. If you said Ben Simmons in 2018 wouldn’t be a top 15 player three seasons later it’d be a surprise."
Then you're going to tell me that Nicholas Batum evolves into Rudy Gobert.       Insert jab at Game Freak here.
If Zubac plays when Gobert are on the floor the Jazz should win those minutes.  Just stay small.  The switch everything scheme is killer against Utah who spams pick and rolls with Gobert.  Force Rudy to post up.
"By Steph? Sure. Steph will cook anybody. However, Rudy is one of the best iso defenders against guards in the league.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/  “For the 2020-21 season, opponent possessions featuring an isolation with Gobert as the primary defender have yielded 0.779 points per chance. That’s fourth-lowest in the NBA among 66 players who have defended at least 125 isolations, per Second Spectrum data, trailing only Draymond Green, Richaun Holmes and Julius Randle — and a big improvement from earlier in Gobert’s career.   A half-decade-old viral clip of Steph Curry turning a younger Gobert around off the dribble has shown remarkable staying power; once or twice a game, some unsuspecting young guard gets Gobert on a switch and assumes it’s easy pickings, only to be rudely awakened to the reality.  Smarter offenses eschew the iso against Gobert, generally in favor of attempting to stretch him out utilizing modern spacing and shooting themes. A ball-handler who can pull up for three, a stretch big man or even both simultaneously can force contortions away from the Jazz’s preferred drop-big defense.  He’s improved here too, though, both in terms of effectiveness and willingness. Today’s Gobert will often play up higher in pick and rolls against known pullup aficionados like Damian Lillard or Devin Booker — but he also has the mobility to recover all the way back to the rim and put out any fires this increased floor space creates.”  Your narrative is way outdated."
I’d def root for the nets so harden can get a ring. Also fuck Rudy gobert
"Omg the only french nba players I can think of right now are Nic Batum, Rudy Gobert, Tony Parker, and Boris Dias.. and honestly they could all pass as brothers lmao"
I hope you’re right/“. At least we know Utah has more players who will consistently show up and have an edge on the glass with Rudy Gobert
The Jazz defense led by Gobert will likely clog the lane and make it harder for this easy layup and mid-range jumpers but Rudy Gobert is not guarding any of the Clippers top offensive players.
Rudy Gobert will be a rude awakening after 7 games against porzingis... hopefully
"Oh boy, I can't wait for 23059 takes over the next two days saying that a team that needed 7 games to beat Maxi Kleber, Boban, and KP at the 5 will schematically destroy Rudy Gobert."
"Guess we'll see what happens, but if Embiid is healthy, the Sixers have a great chance.  For the record, Ben isn't even really the third scoring option when he's on the court. I think people just need to get their head around the fact that someone can be highly valuable without being one of his team's scorers. No one has this conversation on this scale about defensive minded centers like Rudy Gobert or Draymond Green type of all stars."
"We, as a society CANNOT let Rudy Gobert sleepwalk into the Finals"
1. Lebron 2. Anthony Davis 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Luka Doncic 7. Steph Curry 8. Klay Thompson 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Paul George 11. Jayson Tatum 12. Joel Embiid 13. Nikola Jokic 14. Damien Lillard 15. Giannis Antetokunpo  Honorable mentions:  Devin Booker/Chris Paul/Rudy Gobert/Donavan Mitchell/Jamal Murray. To say top 15 easy is laughable.
Rudy Gobert asking for more pop-corn.
Rudy Gobert wouldn't guard Trae either. Checkmate atheists
I guess it depends what you value but I think what Rudy does is more irreplaceable. We were 13-6 in the 19 games that Mitchell missed this year that Gobert played in. If you want to give the badge to the player that led their team to the best record I think Gobert playing 71/72 games is also a factor.
"Paul George- probably   Kyrie Irving- 100%, you can’t tell the story of the NBA without mentioning him  Jimmy Butler- Probably, if he declines further his chances go down. He’s not a HOFer right now   DeMar DeRozan- No, sadly  Rudy Gobert- Needs more. It took Ben Wallace a while and he had a ring against a great team. Defense isn’t valued as much clearly"
"Better than Gobert for sure. I'll defend how good Rudy is day in and day out, but Jokic was giving him problems and it's not hard to figure out exactly why that is."
If Rudy Gobert gets to the finals I am going to k*ll myself
"I don’t *hate* them, but I do enjoy rooting against Rudy Gobert.  He’s a great player, but sometimes he does something and it’s like, “Man, go sit your goofy ass down somewhere.”  His flop during the Grizzlies series comes to mind."
We need to bring back the NBA awards just to see [the suits Rudy Gobert wears.](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16601912/usa_today_12953040.jpg)
Idk where he’s projected but Neemias Queta could be a late 1st round/second round steal. He’s built in the mold of someone like Rudy Gobert but he has fantastic hands and showed he could step out and shoot the 3 as well. He’s currently ranked like the 4th best center in the draft. The dude averaged a ridiculous 3.3 Blocks per game at Utah State and for a 7-footer he’s got pretty quick feet. Some weaknesses was he was turnover prone and would take plays off every now and then
draymond definitely didn’t steal a dpoy from rudy gobert lmao
"ben can only score at the rim, rudy is a rim protector. ben scored 42, case closed.  Also I thought gobert ""is an area defender, you can't look at one on one stats!"" So he wasn't defending the area very well huh? against a guy who doesn't even have the gravity to pull him out."
Denver drafted   * Jusuf Nurkic * Rudy Gobert * Nikola Jokic * Jamal Murray * Michael Porter Jr.  * Garry Harris  this front office is so fuckin good
"Rudy ""19/18/3 and holding the opposition to 80 points in a game 7 but is somehow blamed"" Gobert"
Have none of the haters seen this?  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/
"Ah yes, Rudy Gobert my favorite guard."
"Conley is very good, but he isn't dropping 30-50. Not really his game nor is he that capable at his age. Gobert will do well on defense hopefully but in an assumed Finals against 6ers or Nets, he isn't gonna look as great guarding those superstars, and he isn't gonna have any major offensive games.  Which means its very necessary that Mitchell goes crazy for them to have any hope of winning a finals especially against the Nets. Against Philly i could see a situation where maybe Rudy won it for locking down Embiid, but thats asking for a lot."
"[Shams] With the DPOY officially going to Rudy Gobert, sources are saying Shaq is in shambles."
"Rudy Gobert impacts the other teams offence on the most consistent basis in the modern NBA.   Someone like Ben Simmons might be able to shut down a guy on a possession, but Gobert has the ability to take away scoring in the paint."
"I must not be seeing those Sixers fans, because I'm not sure I've even seen one support Gobert, until maybe right now. But if you say so  I won't deny that there are some Jazz fans going overboard. Most of us are protective of Rudy because he gets shit on constantly."
6’3 and can’t defend. Both of them.. maybe if you have Rudy gobert behind them. Or embiid.
Rudy Gobert? Lol why not choose a good wing defender like Thybulle or some shit.
Uh This is a classic support your boy no matter what.. Booker is great offensively but defensely is closer to Trae Young than Rudy gobert
"Excluding the championship (and the legal issues), Rudy Gobert at age 28 has done as much or more than Ben Wallace entire career."
"Jazz is better with Mitchell than without him, it isn't even a question. But the drop without Gobert is huge, people tend to forget it because he's really durable but the last times he missed a significant number of games Jazz really struggled, he carries a lot defensively and is also important to Jazz offense. Favors has been really good so far in those playoffs but without Rudy Jazz's system is just unplayable, I don't think they would have beaten the Grizzlies to begin with."
"Gobert can't guard the opposing teams best player. Rudy has something on the league. 3 times?! You can't tell me he can guard guys like Steph, Durant, LeBron, Kawhi, even opposing centers like Embiid and Jokic. Don't get me wrong, he's very skilled, but come on. This year was Simmons imo"
"I’m stunned at how far Myles Turner dropped. I understand the team record and the injuries, but sheeesh. The man had 31 less block than Gobert in only 47 games (as compared to 71 for Rudy). He was 4th in DRPM, led the league in blocks per game, and this was all with a depleted team around him while playing with his own ailings."
"I think he’ll get in too, which IMO is more of a reflection of the standards of this sports hall of fame. Gobert is a really good player, but I just don’t think he’s that important in the scope of the league. He should have a really nice resume by the end of his career but for me it’s like do we really need to remember Rudy Gobert? In 20 years when you look at his basketball reference page with a big gold “Hall of Fame” banner will that feel right?"
Name it the Rudy Gobert trophy already!
"&gt; Yes, Rudy “all class” Gobert who joked about the pandemic, coughed on microphones and got people sick - literally caused a temporary locker room rift.  You forgot to include the part where he apologized for it afterwards, and said that he should be seen as an example of how not to act to Covid."
"Where did I say Rudy doesn't deserve dpoy? I'm looking at my post and it says ""'didn't Ben Simmons score 42 on Rudy Gobert?"" I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that maybe my account was hacked by Russians and they changed my comment. 🇷🇺🤷‍♂️"
I'm looking for the post where I completely invalidate the entire season of Rudy Gobert. Got a link?
"At least this way when arguments about the best defenders of all time come up, we can now say Rudy Gobert literally shut down the entire league single handedly."
"CJ and Dame can work out if the other players on the team are great defense player like Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green, and healthy Anthony Davis protect paint with help defense. They would also need a wings who can defend like Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Pascal Siakam, Mikal Bridges, and OG Anunoby."
Rudy Gobert is like Marmite you either hate it or love it. I hate Marmite but l love RG*3
"We need Ayton, and Rudy Gobert is on that team to the North though"
2020-21 Covid Offensive Player of the Year: Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert
He traded Rudy Gobert for cash considerations
Welp Rudy gobert officially takes the cake from Derrick rose as the most overrated player of all time
Don’t sell yourselves short! They also drafted Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert.
"It is right, and that not a knock against Mitchell at all. If Don misses games, his role on offense is filled by guys like Ingles, Conley, Bogey, Clarkson stepping up and doing more. We still feel the loss and we're nowhere near as good but we are able to plug the hole. Without Gobert we have Favors, and Favors is damn good but nowhere near plugging the hole that Rudy leaves."
Rudy Gobert
"I like Rudy Gobert. Good for him.  Reading that he’s won this three times, I still can’t believe that Tim Duncan never won it once."
"I maintain that they need to gamble on it. Every block Gobert gets on him is 10k to charity from Ja, if Ja gets the dunk on Rudy its 50k from Rudy to charity."
"That's Rudy ""Patient 0"" Gobert to you . Throw some respect on the man's name."
Hall of Famer Rudy Gobert. Huh I guess it could happen
"The Snyder decision was gold, because it got him points, and removed a foul from his best defensive player. It also got a foul on Cousins, and a team foul (they ended up in the bonus that quarter). Four positives from one review. It was worth a review even if it wasn't a clear cut wrong call.  I'd say that Rudy Gobert fouling out with 5mins to go (when he got his 5th foul) would have likely impacted the game by more than 3 points. You are right, I can't prove that, there are too many variables. Just because something is complicated, and I can't easily calculate the odds doesn't make the guaranteed result ""always the right one"". The odds are the odds, regardless how many variables are involved. One decision will be favoured because of the odds of that event. The favourability of that event is not based on how easily those odds are to determine."
So what is Rudy Gobert?
"Right, Rudy is no offensive star, but Ben Wallace never averaged double digit points in a season, while Gobert is averaging 14.6 over the last 5 seasons. Gobert already has almost double the career offensive win shares (41.3) than Wallace accumulated in his entire 16 year career (22.9)."
"I don’t think it would be too good. Jokic likes to work on the inside. He can play on the outside but he’s best in the post with players running around him and cutting, trying to get open. Rudy is best in the PnR and as a lob threat. Having both of them on the floor together limits those type of plays. Sure, in theory you could run a Jokic/Gobert PnR but idk how frequently you could do it."
"lets put it this way - if you could only have one of the two on your team (and yea we dont know all the other variables/players but assume its an average team) do you want draymond green or rudy gobert? seems like a decent question. im going dray all day. im a dubs fan but like he said, there is practically no situation where dray is a liability, and he orchestrates the entire rest of the team on defense. not to mention he can basically run an offense too."
[It's pretty telling that star players openly call him out but 🤷‍♂️](https://nothinbutnets.com/2020/09/16/nets-kevin-durant-shot-rudy-gobert/)
Havent really been able to see rudy gobert as a dpoy since d-rose whooped his ass in his 50point game even tho i know he is excellent defender with now 3 dpoys
That guy probably thinks someone like Sabonis is more valuable to a winning team than Rudy Gobert.
Dead Ass I’ve watched both teams an unhealthy amount this year.  Rudy Gobert is a significantly better and more impactful defender and it’s not even close
"Yes, Rudy “all class” Gobert who joked about the pandemic, coughed on microphones and got people sick - literally caused a temporary locker room rift.   But Simmons is the annoying dousche.   Rudy deserved it, but all those acting like Simmons wasn’t in the conversation is ridiculous"
"Wow, congrsts Rudy! All these international players winning the big name awards the last couple of years (Giannis, Jokic, Gobert, Siakam, Luka, etc.)"
"This is the game you're referring to..   @andyblarsen: Joel Embiid matchup data against Rudy Gobert last night:   8-18 FG, 1-4 3P, 5-7 FT, 22 points, 1 assist"
Rudy Gobert is gonna be a hall of famer and Shaq is gonna lose it
"""*Wouldn't be able to do it without you guys.*"" - Rudy Gobert  ""*We know.*"" - Joe Ingles"
"&gt;Since we are at it, what if both teams shot their FG% average  That's a lot harder to calculate, and isn't something that can be adjusted as easily. By some metrics, 3 pointers are something that defenses have very little to do with - [Ken Pomeroy has written about this.](https://kenpom.com/blog/offense-vs-defense-3point-percentage/) Granted, it's possible that there are differences between the college and pro games on this front, but on the whole, it stands to reason that how an offense performs from 3 has more to do with how good the offense is than how good the defense is.  On the other hand, 2 point shots *do* depend heavily on the defense. An easy illustration of that is comparing a 2 point shot at the rim being defended by Rudy Gobert to one defended by, say, Patrick Beverly. Compare that to a good look at a 3, which will be missed around 60% of the time, no matter who the defender is.   In addition, the distance of 2pt shots matter much more - a dunk will have a lot more expectation of being made than a 12 footer, so I can't just say that the Clippers should have made x% of their 2s based on their season average, if the Jazz were forcing their 2s to be coming from further out than usual.  But yeah - a 20pt swing isn't likely just reverting both teams to their averages."
"Okay, then Ben Simmons leads the NBA in Steals and Drtg, Gobert leads it in Blocks and on/off numbers. What's the tie breaker? Whichever stats you value more.  The awards have always been about which player fits the common perception best. Is the MVP of the league really the superstar of the best team? No, but people generally agreed that the award meant and so it is. The MVP award is given to the player whose most closely fits the idea of what the MVP award means to the most people. That doesn't mean that other people are wrong.  Rudy Gobert is going to win his third DPOY this year. His defensive impact and playstyle fit better with what people expect a DPOY to be, that does not mean that people who consider Ben or Draymond to be better are ""wrong"" it just means that their subjective valuation of defensive ability is different to the norm.  You cannot equalize different ideas of what the game should be. I think that playnaking is more important than scoring but scorers are way more likely to win MVP than playmaker are. The awards are decided by a vote, not an algorithm. They are meant to be subjective opinions."
"Mitchell was better in game 1, but Rudy was better all season (and the Memphis series btw). We stagger Gobert and Mitchell so we run units with just one almost every game. The Rudy but no Donovan units were fantastic while the Donovan but no Rudy units were average at best. Gobert had an on/off of 19.1 this year, which was best in the league. Donovan was -3.2, but it’s not like we were bad with him on, +8.0 with Mitchell on and +11.2 with him off. +8 would’ve still been good enough for best team net rating in the league."
no Javala McGee is average and not a starter. Dwight Howard now is average but not a starter.   Rudy Gobert is a starting DPOY level centre who averages a double double. 70% of that is pretty high when you're the best in the game on defence.   Clint Capela is a good example but he also gets paid 20+ million
George was shut down by the Jazz defense. Why do people not understand this. Did you see him trying to shoot over Rudy Gobert in his face
"Ayton came in second to Rudy Gobert in the same stat last year IIRC, another center I didn't expect so high on the list"
"How exactly does he prove that? If Gobert went down, and we could see how the team performed without him, we might have something to talk about. But Donovan's great game proves nothing about how valuable Gobert is to that team. Without Rudy, I believe they get swept by any remaining west team."
Rudy definitely controls the whole game defensively. Draymond is really smart but I think his competitive nature makes it hard for him to be objective about how great Gobert is defensively.
"&gt; ""Everybody like, 'Look, oh, man, this guy led the league in steals, that guy led the league in blocks.' But is there a situation where you can put that guy in and make him uncomfortable? For most guys, yes. You can't put me in a situation on defense and make me uncomfortable."" https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/draymond-green-explains-what-puts-him-above-rudy-gobert-dpoy-debate  I get what Draymond is saying here but he needs to explain this a bit better. He's right those defensive stats are overrated but he should counter with other better ways to measure defense."
"Haha I was being a little hyperbolic but ""one of the best post defenders of all time"" is still a reasonable take imo. ""Rim protector"" means guarding post-ups. [This](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/) article touches on it (ctrl-f ""post""). Tl;dr post-ups against Gobert are atrocious if your name isn't Embiid or Jokic."
&gt;but there are way worse players on max contracts right now than Rudy Gobert lol  This entire sentence is irrelevant since it doesn't matter what other contracts are bad.
"Lol the irony is that the Jazz aren’t taking Gobert off the floor there in a million years. The Jazz *never* take Rudy off in clutch defensive situations, and last night was a prime example of why. I have no idea what Lue was thinking. Does he read Twitter comments for his scouting reports?"
He plays for the Jazz. Look at multiple DPOY Rudy Gobert. No respect there either. Being locked into a long term contract on a small market team with zero chances of him leaving means very little buzz from mainstream. They missing out.
"&gt; I mean, dude is about to be one of four players to ever win DPOY three or more times, with no real signs of slowing down on that end.  That's true, but in the past it really hasn't amounted to anyone.  He would go up against Houston or something in the playoffs and then look like trash out there getting out rebounded by PJ Tucker with Houston going small or something like that.  &gt; but there are way worse players on max contracts right now than Rudy Gobert lol  This is true, but that doesn't mean Shaq is wrong.  &gt; Offensively, sure, he’s not putting up 30 a game,  I mean it's a lot more than that offensively, but sure."
I better not see anymore dumbass Jazz fans claiming Rudy Gobert is their best and most valuable player. It's time Donovan Mitchell gets the respect he deserves.
"Zubac was outplaying Gobert to be fair.   Zubac deserved the recognition he was getting.  This being said, Comparing Zubac to Rudy is not a great comparison."
"He’s not, he’s just super petty and hates Rudy Gobert for earning a larger contract than him even tho they played in different eras with different salary caps."
"I used to hate Rudy Gobert because of the whole COVID thing, but man is a defensive beast"
"Yeah.  Noel seemed like a perennial DPOY contender and Okafor seemed like a perennial scoring champ contender.    Also, even though idk shit about which players will develop and which won't, that 2013 draft was especially weird.  At the time I thought Noel, Shabazz, and Trey Burke were steals at their respective picks...while Giannis and Rudy Gobert got picked behind all of them."
I saw Simmons get blown by time and time again last game when guarding Trae. I’ve also seen him have good possessions defending him and smaller players. I guess my point is that if the guys mentioned in this thread can guard 1-5 then Rudy Gobert belongs in that list too. Only a couple of these guys could even attempt to actually guard 5’s that aren’t big men let’s be real.
"I just love how people get mad at the ""played off the floor"" line, it literally shows that it's the truth and it stings so bad that you have to mention everytime he has a good game.  Rudy Gobert literally got sat in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Houston Rockets due to how unplayable he was, Harden and CP3 hunted him down so bad that he averaged 30.4 mpg in that series as the reigning DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR."
Thats it! Im officially putting Rudy Gobert over Karl MaPedo as a top Jazz player ever. 👧👧
"I mean, dude is about to be one of four players to *ever* win DPOY three or more times, with no real signs of slowing down on that end.  Offensively, sure, he’s not putting up 30 a game, but there are way worse players on max contracts right now than Rudy Gobert lol"
"One Piece is so fucking good, man, I started a while ago when Rudy Gobert wore Luffy shoes on the court.  Been reading ever since."
"Everyone is going to talk about the timeout not being called, and that's fair.   But what about Rondo not speeding up the floor while Rudy has his back turned? He really walks the ball up past halfcourt, taking off about 4 seconds from the game clock, and allows Gobert to matchup with Morris in the corner on the baseline.   Even if Ty Lue was hellbent on running this DHO, Rondo pushing the pace forces at least 2 Utah defenders (Gobert with his back turned, and probably Ingles since he's closest) to slow him down, which would've created a considerable amount of space for PG to operate on the left wing.   Instead, he sorta just jogs up the court, gives Gobert a chance to matchu, and for Royce to pick him up at the 3pt line, forcing the first handoff to Kawhi.  Look, if that ball gets below the FT line with 12 seconds left on the clock., I guarantee there's an open kickout pass to a fairly open Kornet/PG/Kawhi."
PG knew he was dog shit from the 3 pt line and decided to pass it to Leonard. Leonard was double teamed and passed it out to someone with a cleaner look. I don't think he realized that someone had Rudy fucking Gobert fucking defending them.
You can't really name any big men 70% of Gobert.   You're asking for an above average defensive shot blocking center with less offensive touch than Rudy.
"Luka is already 1st team all nba in his 2nd season, is the most important player on a playoff team(Rudy Gobert and Mitchell is debatable to who is more valuable for the jazz) . Just had a playoff series nearly averaging a 30+ pt tripled double. If you replace Luka with Donavan rn Jazz are in the same tier of team as the Brooklyn nets. No one is taking Donovan over Luka fan, player, gm whatever."
"It’s as if you’re forgetting the shot was blocked.   Your argument would be perfect if it was the classic lebron case of passing to a teammate and he just missed. No. It was blocked. And not by Joe ingles, or Bogdonovich, or some surprise play. It was Rudy mfin Gobert. That plays into the decision making.   So you ask would I want Kawhi taking a contested ‘bad’ shot. YES. Rudy Gobert with one foot in the paint means that man is not open. That ending was predictable"
"People are going to meme PG, but Rudy was a large contributor to him going 4/17. He tried to go inside early and Gobert wasn't having it. He also air balled a reverse layup with Rudy near him."
rudy unironically dominates every advanced defensive stat  its interesting that you would diminish these stats that prove gobert is clearly the best defender in the nba
"out of all the hot take hills to die on, you chose the hate on rudy gobert hill one."
"Donovan Mitchell is way better that you think he is,  and Rudy Gobert is the best Jazz player."
"So fun watching r/NBA fall apart with their cognitive dissonance after watching Dononvan drop 45, while Rudy Gobert still won the game for Utah &amp; was the obvious best player-- while barely scoring 10 pts &amp; hardly touching the ball on offense."
"No he is not lol. Donovan Mitchell has proved 2 years in a row in the Playoffs now that he's by far the best player on the Jazz. idc how many advanced stats you bring or whatever Jazz fans say, Mitchell raises his level in the playoffs while Rudy stays the same/regresses a little. He is much more important in the playoffs than Gobert is"
"Anyone who says “you’ve never hooped” on Reddit is basically exposing themselves as a total wanker. Especially when they’re wrong.  That was straight up great defense by Utah. They covered the pick at the key, played close man-to-man on the perimeter, and Rudy absolutely saved himself after biting on the pump fake. That recovery he made to get the block was incredible.  If anyone’s to blame, it’s Marcus, since his dribble after the fake gave Rudy time to recover. But even then, I can’t blame him because 99% of the defenders in the league ain’t blocking that shot after the fake. Unfortunately for him, Gobert is built like Gumby and tipped it."
Rudy Gobert has definitely improved defensively over the years what are you talking about
"Not for nothing, Rudy Gobert posted one of the best defensive seasons in NBA history by tons of advanced metrics. Obviously there's some noise there, defensive analytics aren't perfect, but at the very top if you look at the list it's all mad up of Greens, Mutumbos, Big Bens, and Goberts. Guy who you *know* are all-time defensive players. [This 538 article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rudy-gobert-is-having-one-of-the-best-defensive-seasons-in-modern-nba-history/) is great on the subject.  Obviously defense will change between eras (defensive rules, styles, etc), and offenses are more potent now than they have really been ever, but I don't think the idea that Gobert is the best defensive player of the *current era* is particularly crazy, and when you compare all-time defensive greats across eras there are a lot of confounding variables that make it possible to come to a conclusion one way or the other.  I think it's a classic strength vs length debate - they exist in very different eras, and I don't think either would be nearly as notable if  they swapped eras, but there are a few places where one clearly outshines the other. It's messy and not as cut-and-dry as people like to make it out to be (either you or the OP who claimed Gobert is the GOAT).   Ben Wallace was a tremendous defender, but he was also never asked to anchor a defense in the same way that Gobert does. He was flanked by other great defenders all the time - Tayshaun Prince and Rasheed Wallace were also excellent on that end of the floor, and the '04 Pistons also never really played a drop big defense because they weren't very in vogue at the time, they were more of a hedging PnR defense. As a result, the burden for any one player on that team (and subsequently their defensive impact) was a lot lower than it would be for a drop coverage like the Jazz have played with since Gobert's rise to prominence. Big Ben absolutely excelled in that role, and he was super verstatile schematically because he had a super low center of gravity and could absorb contact from big post guys. He also had awesome foot speed that let him and Sheed switch pretty regularly. If you're asking who can put the clamps down on Shaq or Z-Bo or Karl Malone in his prime, who can absorb a post-up from a huge guy and  stay connected, you'd want Ben. He'd do a much better job of guarding Embiid, Jokic, Ayton, or any of the other premier offensive bigs who can bang around in the post.  However, Gobert is much better at recovering than Ben Wallace was, he's a much better rim protector, and he's way more able to keep up with quicker guards when they're trying to isolate on him. People like to post the clip from the Jazz - Warriors series five years ago where Steph puts Gobert in the blender, but Gobert is actually sneakily one of the best guard defenders in the NBA and he's great venturing out on the perimeter. He might just be the best rim protector in NBA history with how monstrous the on-off defensive numbers are, even when adjusted for team and opposing lineups. The fact of the matter is that the NBA right now is not a post-up league - being able to defend Tim Duncan is not a skill that's in super high demand anymore. It's a guard's league and a forward's league. And Gobert is much better at deterring shots at the rim and contesting things close to the basket, which is what has anchored such a potent jazz defense. Plus he's an all-time pick-and-roll defender. Wallace was great, but in the areas where Gobert excels (all of which are really highly prized in the modern game). I think Gobert is the best rim protector of all time, and probably one of the best defenders ever in terms of guarding the pick-and-roll, not to mention he consistently is the only all-defense caliber defender on elite defenses that rank in the top of the league on a regular basis  Comparing across eras never works 1:1, but I don't think calling Gobert the GOAT defender is crazy in the same way that calling Bill Russell or Hakeem or Rodman or KG the GOAT defender is crazy even if I personally disagree. When you have the truly transcendent, era-defining defensive unicorns like Gobert or Draymond or Wallace, comparing between them might work season-to-season or game-to-game, but since they're all very differrent defensive players it's hard to say ""this guy is the GOAT defender"". For my money, it's Gobert. I'm also a Jazz fan though, and I only know Wallace by watching some film; I didn't have to watch him guard my favorite players on a daily basis for years. I have bias. I don't think there's a right answer (copout I know), but I also think there are a lot of answers that aren't outright wrong answers either."
"""I can't remember a guy getting this much slander.""     You should post a thread in r/nba about Rudy Gobert."
"I’m not gonna go back and watch the whole game.  But that happens maybe 2-3 times.  Luke  kennard got cooked.  Reggie Jackson got cooked.  Rudy Gobert played just fine.   Like you said he’s gonna get scored on, beat in some of those situations that’s not getting cooked."
Look I think what you are saying applies to 95% of big guys in the league and makes total sense. I can also tell you as a Jazz fan who has watched every game there is no way in hell that Gobert is getting taken out of the game. If it was 5 point guards on offense Rudy is still in that game.
Rudy isn't like any other 7 footer. He's the best defender in basketball. You think Jordan Clarkson or Georges Niang could do a better job in that situation? The Jazz have won games trusting Gobert to defend in those scenarios before.
&gt; that's a risk no matter who is playing defense  ... the whole point of defensive substitutions in these situations is to mitigate risk. Defence is about taking away the best of your opponent's offence. Leaving in a 7 footer to navigate a screen on a critical play like this is lunacy. Rudy Gobert chasing far more mobile 40% three point shooters around screens is not a very good way of reducing the risk of a made three pointer.
Dudes in my group chat said Marcus Morris would take Rudy Gobert out of the game and this is the best thing that could have happened for me.
Rudy “Just 3x DPOY tall” Gobert
"Yeah because not a single non-American player is in top 26 players lol.   No not the current MVP Jokic, not the 2x in row MVP Giannis, not Doncic who almost singlehandedly fucked the Clippers, not the Embiid who is carrying first seed in East, not the 3 times in row DPOY Rudy Gobert. No one from them is top 26, naah"
"Most people and coaches credit Rudy Gobert as their best player, and he deserves ALOT of credit.     But he cannot do what Mitchell did for them in that second half."
From Rudy “can’t guard the perimeter” Gobert??
"I agree that the clippers hit tons of tough layups. Nothing you can do about that. I also agree that honestly it’s his offense that’s the biggest issue because he can’t play teams out of small ball lineups because he can’t take advantage of the offensive mismatches like other bigs  I also never said Rudy shouldn’t be in DPOY conversations. He’s a great defender  I just feel like there are a lot of gobert stans that put him in the top 10-15 players in the league (at least I have seen these comments on thread before) and if they want to consider him on that spot then he should be shouldering a chunk of blame for the loss. I’ve seen a lot of people saying it was the rest of the teams fault for just letting their guys past but they are not max contract stars.  Yes there have also been a lot of people putting all the blame on Rudy too, that’s just dumb because it wasn’t all his fault and they just like to hate on him. In all reality Rudy is somewhere in between where people consider him but this sub get so hot and cold on him. He has a bad game and people say he’s a huge liability. He has a good game and people say he’s the best player on the jazz, top 10-15 player, and should be considered in the top 3 defensive players of all time. In all reality, he’s somewhere in between those two extremes but this sub has no middle ground"
Not even a good matchup for Giannis. Just because he's a DPOY doesn't mean he should be able to cover 1-5. See: Rudy Gobert. This narrative is so stupid
This was the first time I knew no elite perimeter player respects Rudy Gobert in the league.
"Yeah, when I say liability, I mean it's always going to be a hole that is exploited in the playoffs, just like Giannis. I think Giannis has a good shot to win it this year, but his inability to make any type of consistent jumper is a liability. If rudy can't punish teams somewhat, he's gong to be a liability against elite teams.   But yeah, it's not all his fault the second half. It's everyones fault including the coaching staff. They didn't put gobert in a place to succeed and allowed him to get exploited after his teammates didn't defend the point of attack."
Kyrie. Nets don’t need him when Harden is healthy. Trade him for Rudy Gobert straight up
Lopez looks like Rudy gobert god damn that’s good d
"It’s not that Gobert had a bad game yesterday, the gameplan that Snyder ran is what lost them the game (and the Jazz wings not being able to defend without Rudy behind them.)  It’s the fact that a simple 5 out completely neutralizes what Rudy does on defense"
"&gt;Which is whatever early but when Mann was 6/8, Rudy didn’t even bother to go contest his 7th. You have to adjust to the game being played.    This is it. For DPOTY Gobert to blame the gameplan is stupid af. Your on the court not the fucking coach. There were multiple times where there was no one else near the basket just the the 7th 3 and Gobet just said ""nah I'm not running out there"".  Dudes a clown and overrated af. Your DPOTY. Act like it and get your ass over there. Jfc. Trade his ass and not to my team.   205mil lmao. What a joke."
The point is that pulling Rudy would not have helped at all. Without Gobert helping it's a layup line to the basket because the Jazz perimeter defense is atrocious and literally can't function without Gobert helping them out.  What had to happen was either the perimter defense has to suddenly become good (not really possible) or they have to rotate to the shooters when Gobert sacks to the paint to help. Instead Snyder changed nothing and prayed for Mann and PBev to miss.
Rudy gobert wasn’t guarding PG.  Giannis is a big who can dribble
Were the Jazz up 20? Did Mitchell's ankle magically become 10× worse during halftime? They choked under the pressure and let their foot off the gas after the lead. Gobert and Snyder got exposed. Rudy is becoming borderline unplayable in the playoffs. Time for the Jazz to reassess.
It's funny that Ben Simmons and Rudy Goberts teams struggle at times because of their lack of offensive game. Both guys are tremendous defenders however they lack that offensive ability that makes them valuable on both sides of the ball and harder to game plan against. Someone like Draymond makes up for his lack of scoring potential by being a top 3 playmaker. Gobert and Simmons need to spend an offseason with CP3 or something.
Rudy Gobert should also get the 6th man of the year award solely cuz of this series.
Watch Draymond Green and Ben Simmons (not offensively) play and you can see why people have issue with Gobert winning DPOY. Gobert stands under the rim with long arms up and people call it a defensive scheme. That shit is good enough for the regular season but not in the playoffs against high calibre teams. This is the 4th YEAR IN A ROW Rudy has been a negative defender in the playoffs yet people still act like he is the best in the NBA on that end. A big reason Giannis wasn't in real contention for MVP this year is because of his play in the playoffs the two years prior. Why don't we hold the 3 X DPOY to the same standard?
The jazz didn’t and couldn’t adjust to what they have been doing all regular season ever since Gobert established himself as a great rim protector. They all play like Rudy will bail them out. Except in the playoffs it doesn’t and hasn’t worked out like that. Ty Lue out-coached Snyder. He schemed up ways to attack Gobert’s weaknesses.
"Ok, and how does that affect what happened yesterday? Rudy's contract hasn't kicked in yet. The Jazz were more than prepared to win this series. Gobert didn't let Mann have his way. Guys like Mitchell and Clarkson who don't understand how to rotate, and Bojan and Ingles who are too slow to rotate, served Mann up every open 3 he wanted. The clippers' scheme was to have five guys who can put the ball on the deck, all of whom could beat their guy off the dribble. We saw Houston try that last year against LA and they got blasted, because every LA defender could stay with his man. When nobody can stay with his man, you get what happened last night. /R/NBA suggesting jazz needed to go small, that Rudy was schemed out of the game, or that Rudy was to blame for Mann going off, shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what happened."
"The is exactly how I feel. I feel like there are a lot of people on this sub who talk about how gobert is a star, a top 15 player in the league, and have seen people say he is the best player on their team. He is making 205M, which is big time money.  But people seem to make excuses for gobert and they don’t hold him to the same standards as other stars. If people want to treat gobert like a star then he should definitely be getting some flack for his team collapsing to a kawhi less clippers.   Not saying that it is all Rudy’s fault. But if people are going to consider him a star then he has to take some of the responsibilities and criticisms star players get when their teams collapse and they play subpar. Now if people want to consider Rudy more like a super elite role player then I think it’s fair to not give him as much blame and blame the team"
"Don’t bother reasoning with this dude he literally just makes shit up   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o3k8b5/rudy_gobert_ends_the_postseason_with_a_whopping/h2cewfj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3  He tried to claim Rudy had one bad game in his playoff career essentially and was confused why he was getting blasted. Give him a break though, it’s probably his first year old enough to watch the NBA playoffs because he genuinely has no clue that this happens to Gobert every single season in the playoffs. Then he’ll try to attack you personally (like the comment above) just because of your flair, when I hadn’t mentioned Ben Simmons or even DPOY  This guy has issues"
"Gobert was slow to close to the short corner, even with guys taking rhythm dribbles. An extra pass couldn’t hurt, but idk that it solves the problem. Rudy being a step slow on the perimeter was always gonna haunt them because of the Clippers ball movement.   Rudy can’t play against small ball, especially come playoff time. That’s fine. Just wish people would acknowledge it lmao."
The Jazz have beaten the dysfunctional OKC team that was blown up the next year and Memphis since Rudy has been “DPOY Rudy Gobert.” There’s no universe where his impact is approaching Superman level player. The only teams Harden has lost to in that time frame were eventual champions.
"The real problem is Rudy's inability to do ANYTHING other than being spoon fed at the basket, which in turns allows teams to play small ball against him. If he was a dominant post scorer then the other team has to play a traditional big and then he's doing what he can do best on deffense, guarding the paint. He gets murdered as soon as he's more than 5ft away from the basket. Think about it, gobert barely scored over 10 pts this series, while mostly matching up with smaller guys. Rudy gobert IS NOT A MAX PLAYER. Period. And since he is being paid as such, the team will have a lot of trouble adding talent to play alongside Patient 0 and Spida."
"[According to the NBA's admittedly wonky player tracking data, the Clippers shot 16-of-28 and scored 44 points when Rudy Gobert was the primary defender last night.](https://twitter.com/FlyByKnite/status/1406300223027126274?s=19)"
It's so weird people choose to hate Gobert so hard that they ignore reality. Fucking Rudy Gobert lmao
