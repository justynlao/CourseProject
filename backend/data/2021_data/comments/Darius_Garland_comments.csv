Isn't darius garland signed there too? That's why (other than them being former teammates) him and Tristan Thompson are such good friends.
"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the home locker room after the final buzzer to give Collin Sexton and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Dylan Windler gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Darius Garland yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Sexton hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Durant hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"&gt; Culver was a project pick  He traded away a respectable asset to move up 5 spots because he wanted Darius Garland and then couldn't walk it back when Cleveland drafted him.  He now has a pair of G-League+ guys and a second round pick at the 4 when he could have sat back, got PJ or Cam Johnson, and then moved Saric for a role player.  The Culver pick baffled me, especially since Okogie is arguably still a better player at this point despite the Culver hype."
"They don’t mean anything for rookies. People dismissed Darius Garland because of his bad stats as a rookie, and he looks like a real NBA player now. Or for a more high profile example, look at Kobe’s rookie stats, he barely played and when he did play he wasn’t dominant or anything. These are 19 year old kids going up against grown men, there’s going to be a year+ learning curve."
Two people who do not like it: Collin Sexton and Darius Garland.
That is the nickname of Collin Sexton and Darius Garland
"Yeah, I understand that; although Darius Garland certainly hadn't locked in the starting job off his rookie season.   I don't blame him, most rookie PGs are not good and he's been significantly better this season, but by the end of last season it wasn't clear that Garland was going to develop into a starter. That would have put pressure on Sexton to be able to handle the ball more."

"Darius Garland, he is currently injured. They combined the last names."
I’m stationed overseas and don’t watch Cleveland when I get to watch nba. How is Darius garland doing? I’m a Vandy fan so I try to keep up with our guys but it’s hard.
Darius Garland with his dad Kevin Love celebrating on the sideline
"20 ppg on 54% TS is not ""so good."" Sexton *is* better than him right now and Darius Garland projects better too."
"Welcome to Game 4 of the 2022 NBA Finals, where the Cleveland Cavaliers are looking to complete a clean sweep of the LeBron James-led Los Angeles Lakers.   The starting five for the Cavaliers tonight is Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Isaac Okoro, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen. Look for big contributions from 6th man Larry Nance Jr off the bench."
"Darius Garland,  Jordan Clarkson,  Jerami Grant,  Christian Wood,  Chris Boucher."
"I honestly was looking at buying a KPJ jersey because the Cavs shop had them practically half off, so I’m glad I got a Darius Garland one instead"
Eh they drafted him knowing he was a risk with his behavior. They got Darius Garland a few picks prior so I imagine they figured they could take a risk with KPJ.
"&gt; Culver is trash though, but he was the BPA where we picked him and considering Saric wanted out badly it was a solid trade to make.  The worst part is we chased after Darius Garland and ""settled"" for Culver after Garland was picked.  Would have so much rather had sat at 11 and then moved Saric separately for something.  That was a really poorly executed play by Rosas."

"I'm definitely not complaining about that as a Cavs fan, you're right. But I was referring to the recent changes to lottery odds that were meant to discourage tanking. These changes to the odds took place after the Cavs run of #1 picks.  Without those changes, Knicks and Cavs fans could be rooting on Zion and Ja instead of RJ Barrett and Darius Garland.  2019 Draft #1 Pelicans - 33 wins #2 Grizzlies - 33 wins #3 Knicks - 17 wins  #4 Lakers - 37 wins #5 Cavs - 19 wins   2020 Draft #1 T-Wolves - 19 wins (3rd worst record) #2 Warriors - 15 wins (worst) #3 Hornets - 23 wins (#9 seed in East)  #4 Bulls - 22 wins #5 Cavs - 19 wins (2nd worst) ... #8 Knicks- 21 wins (5th worst record)  In other words, Gilbert and Dolan are getting the team ownership equivalent of the ""ball don't lie"" phenomenon..."
"Theo Maledon is back to back MVP in 2026-27 and I went to two consecutive Finals (losing to Darius Garland and Emoni Bates' Chicago), but was fired by OKC for going deep into the luxury tax.  10/10 would exceed luxury tax again."
Darius Garland was the worst starter in the NBA last year and now looks good. Everyone here has their clown makeup for rushing to judgment so early.
Nah genuinely just curious. Don’t watch the knicks so I don’t know if he’s stat stuffing or turning a corner. People laughed at me for wanting the Pistons to trade for him and Darius Garland in the offseason haha
Nah LeBron just confirmed him with Darius Garland
You listed 8 Cavs without mentioning him but Darius Garland may be the most important player to watch moving forward with CLE.
"Yeah, I definitely wish that we have more players available for the next game, our depth chart is looking rough:   &amp;nbsp;  [](/CLE)Cavs|**Starter**|**2nd**|**3rd**|**4th**|**5th**| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |PG|~~Darius Garland~~ |~~Dante Exum~~|~~Matthew Dellavedova~~|Collin Sexton|-| |SG|Collin Sexton|~~Dylan Windler~~ |Damyean Dotson|~~Kevin Porter Jr.~~ |~~Dante Exum~~| |SF|~~Isaac Okoro~~ |~~Kevin Porter Jr.~~|Cedi Osman|~~Dylan Windler~~ |~~Dante Exum~~| |PF|~~Kevin Love~~ |Larry Nance Jr.|Cedi Osman|~~Isaac Okoro~~|Dean Wade| |C|Andre Drummond|Larry Nance Jr.|JaVale McGee|~~Kevin Love~~|Thon Maker|   Also, unrelated, but Cole Anthony looked pretty good in there tonight for Orlando."

Haven’t seen him brought up yet but Darius Garland looks like a stud
"If the cavs got harden and kept Colin Sexton and Darius Garland, they would have HardSexLand"
"Hm. Cam Reddish, De'Andre Hunter, Colin Sexton, Darius Garland, Nikola Vucevic and Markelle Fultz, respectively?"
&gt;Darius Garland  I like you
Everyone will say the obvious:   Ima go with Darius Garland and Cam Reddish
**East:**  Starters:  G - Trae  G - Jaylen   FC - KD  FC - Giannis  FC - Embiid  Bench:  G: Kyrie  G: Simmons  FC: Sabonis  FC: Tatum  FC: Middleton  Wildcard: Vucevic  Wildcard: Darius Garland   **West:**  Starters:  G - Harden  G - McCollum  FC - LeBron  FC - Kawhi  FC - Jokic  Bench:  G: Luka  G: Dame  FC: AD  FC: Ingram  FC: Gobert  Wildcard: PG  Wildcard: Curry
"As long he gets meaningful playing time this season he has a chance to improve his sophomore season. Last year Darius Garland, Jaret Culver, De'Andre Hunter, and Cam Reddish were bad. This year they have positive impact on their team."
"PGs need time. I agree with the smartest guy in the room take KOC can be a little not seeing the forest through the trees sometimes. That being said everyone thought Darius garland sucked and now he’s playing great. Same with Sexton. Jamal Murray wasn’t lighting it up from day 1, neither was Fox. Trae young was one of the worst players in the league for 2 months of his rookie season. PG is a really hard position to translate to the NBA level. Killian might not be good, but let’s give him a couple seasons before declaring that, because it’s very easy to have egg on your face with young PGs. Patience"
"*gets hired by the Cavs*  ""Darius Garland is the most player I've ever seen"""
"Bro what. Go on Cleaning the Glass, Darius Garland, look at his lineup data. Garland is actively making the team worse when he is on the floor."
It’s absolutely ridiculous that Darius Garland didn’t make this team given the season he is having. The man is a MIP candidate for crying out loud.  Really goes to show that nobody in the national media cares about Cleveland if LeBron isn’t there.
Sexton was snubbed last year and now Darius Garland this year. Unbelievable.
Yes I’m biased. Yes I know you could make the argument everyone here deserves it over him.  I’m still quite upset Darius Garland isn’t on this roster.
Darius garland? Immanuel Quickley?
Where is Darius Garland? Wow
Someone explain to me how Darius Garland is not on here??????
Darius garland robbed big time
I agree. I’m hoping I can see Darius Garland in as a Cavs fan
Darius Garland making an impact without his shot falling is huge for his future. 3 straight games of 8 plus assists.   hopefully at some point he’s just forced to take 3’s and take contact. this guy easily has a 27/10 ceiling and it’s fun to watch.   he just played his 82nd NBA game this week and still hasn’t played 100 basketball games since high school. i think we are going to see the handles get unleashed in the coming months and we might see him take a leap if he can get those buckets to fall. he’s like 45/39/87 right now and he just needs to take enough 3’s and free throws

Darius garland was definitely paid to lose that game
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9.

Darius Garland is a point guard.   Sexton is the shooting guard.   Garland has shown better playmaking instincts along with his tight handles. JC is much closer to (a worse) Colin Sexton than he is to Garland.
"Look, that back court has to be broken up.    Darius Garland as an undersized SG is not working longterm.    Sexton is better, so trade Garland"

"I don’t think he’s underrated, there are just a ton of young talents in the league so he gets left out. RJ was a 3rd overall pick for a reason, he’s good. He will be great in his prime but I don’t necessary think he’s a top 25 young player yet.   Dejounte Murray is averaging 16-7-5. Darius Garland is averaging 17-6 on 45-40-85 shooting, Malik Beasley is averaging 20ppg on 44-40-85 shooting. Lots of great young players that are left out because the league is so filled with them."
Darius Garland will be an all star in the next 5 years
Basically Darius Garland vs the spurs.

"How do you know they will have at least 2 top 3-5 picks? Can you tell me if I’m going to win the lottery? Seems like you’re assuming there’s 100% that the Nets will have a terrible record, and the pick will hit 1-5 with the new lottery odds.   And probably the most laughable thing you assume is a 50% chance that a single top 5 pick will be better than Ben Simmons? That would essentially mean that you think Simmons is the average top 5 pick, which is just hilarious. The top 5 picks from the last 2 drafts were Zion, Jah Morant, RJ Barrett, DeAndre Hunter, Darius Garland, Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, LaMelo, Patrick Williams, and Isaac Okoro. The only guys that have even shown the potential to be better than Simmons are Zion, Jah, and LaMelo (3/10)"

"That ain't about being a homer usually tho, calling a Horton-Tucker a ""future star"" is being delusional, right, but calling Darius Garland or KPJ one - not so much."
"He gets thrown on the best scorer every night and has progressively learned to avoid getting called for fouls constantly and is starting to apply the clamps. He also plays some great help defense.   The last two weeks or so he's shown an ability to slash and score and I think that given more time he'll grow to be pretty effective offensive role player.   Last years pick, Darius Garland is starting to mature as a distributor and Okoro is often the beneficiary."
You played the Magic who’s top option was Dwayne Bacon and the Cavs who’s top option was Darius Garland.......
I've been silently rooting for Moses since seeing him in that goofy vid with Darius Garland on Overtime.
darius garland played 5 games in between high school and the NBA and i pretty much consider him to be right from high school
"He’s getting destroyed because it was a terrible opinion lol. The Wiggins dlo trade was a win win, if the wolves weren’t injured then it would be just a mid lottery pick and getting off of Wiggins contract for a player who fit their position of need and keeps the franchise player happy. Gersson also seemed to hit on his draft picks so idk how you sound rn Ant and Jaden look great, culver has been a miss but they wanted Darius Garland and traded up to get him but Cleveland took him instead. From what I’m seeing Rosas’s scouting has looked great, injuries and covid just fucked up his plan"
"cavs got that, his name is darius garland"
Darius Bazely or Garland?

"He has the ability to become an elite defender and is very raw offensively. Remember, we drafted him to play on a team with Colin Sexton, Darius Garland, and Kevin Porter Jr so offense wasn’t going to be a problem"
"It’s cool how the top 4 don’t change, but I do wonder where Darius Garland is? Surely he’s been better than NAW"
"Sure, but again, Collin Sexton, Darius Garland, and Jordan Poole, just off the top of my head, were all some of the worst players *ever* their rookie years. It happens. I'm not saying they shouldn't move him if the right player is available, but people on this sub have been treating him like he can't be good for at least 3-4 seasons, which is very much not true."
Darius Garland
Darius Garland is at 11.5 / 6.2. This is another point against Sexton lol. He's clearly passing into lower quality looks
Let's go inside the mind of a Darius Garland...
Haven't watched his full games much but Darius Garland highlights hit different
"Darius Garland, da hardest hittin player in da league"
"Darius Garland is just getting started; very excited for year 3. I think DG, Ja, and RJ will be argued over as the 2nd best player in the draft in years to come."
"Dean Wade, Matthew Dellavedova, Collin Sexton, Darius Garland, ICE Okoro"
He gets plenty of love and got lots of all star votes. If anything Darius Garland is underrated in my opinion
So you think darius garland is a good backcourt mate for him? He's improved his playmaking
"He’s clearly the best player on the Grizz, leads them in scoring and assists. Dillon Brooks? Really bro? Crazy recency bias, Ja’s just had a bad week.  The surrounding talent around Ja and Fox are similar, yet ones in the playoff race and one is 10 games below .500. If you actually think Ja and Darius Garland are on the same level then you’re underrating Ja."
"It’s just kind of fallen that way lol. On top of that I have Darius Garland and Payton Pritchard at point. Grayson Allen as my backup 2 and my weakest point is Center where I have a cast of Mo Wagner, Jarred Vanderbuilt and Jalen Smith"

"that article had absolutely nothing to do with why the ball shouldn’t have been live, try linking me to a rule book next time instead of a darius garland quote who didn’t see what even happened"
"Eh, kinda disagree that he wouldn’t be criticized heavily on a different team.  Darius garland got shit on all of last season for almost a super similar situation with having only 5 college games and no offseason essentially. Only major difference being that the warriors have a superstar and better vets than the Cavs have/had.  But I agree that it probably is *somewhat* exasperated by playing for a more popular team and that wiseman definitely shouldn’t be shat on for not being an absolutely an insane rookie."
"This is a good point while a ton of people here criticize wiseman.   I (and many other cavs fans) made the same point for Darius garland last year (he had only played 5 college games), and a lot of people were already calling him a bust last year. I definitely wouldn’t write off wiseman by any means in the same vein.   I think great rookies have given people way too many high expectations in recent times."

5th in this order  1. Daniel Gafford  2. Zion Williamson  3. Ja Morant  4. RJ Barrett  5. Darius Garland
"Well, yeah. They're 22 and 21. There's lots of time to put together an entirely different team around them, and frankly this would be too early to have a good team around them cause they're still young and developing.   That said, I'm also not sure about adding another ball-dominant scorer unless we go full Golden State and start running a motion offense, trying to utilize Hartenstein's passing to open up the cutting games for our guards and having Darius run point and Sexton take over if the offense isn't working.   Really just need some big, athletic forwards with decent lateral speed. We've got great pieces here at 1,2 and 5 (no diss to Okoro, he's def gonna be good but he's also short and might be better off the bench behind Sexton) but right now we couldn't possibly handle any team (now or future) with size like the Lakers/Clippers where they're too big for our guards and too small for our bigs. We'll always be mildly defensively deficient due to Garland/Sexton being small, but that combined with mismatches at 3-4 is unsalvageable defensively."
"Darius Garland is so good, holy shit."
I will mot stand for Darius Garland slander
Now called Sexland. Obviously because of Collin Sexton and Darius Garland.

"he never said garland could do what ja can (in terms of athleticism), he said garland is shiftier, and that he doesn't see a difference in how you get past somebody as long as you do. you said ""i think there is"", and then didn't really elaborate on that.   if i had to come up with somewhat of a similar comparison, it would be curry and westbrook, as you've both used those in your arguments. westbrook is an athletic pg who can't shoot, like ja, and garland is a better shooter, like curry. it's not a perfect comparison though. i honestly don't have much time to watch games, but i do think in the pg position, having a good shooter is more important. [garland](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/darius-garland-shot-chart) being 4 percentage points behind [ja](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/ja-morant-shot-chart) at the rim doesn't make up for ja's lack of a 3. if i had to choose on stats alone, it would be garland. he's ahead in efG% and ts%"

"The obvious answer is ""Cade is big enough to play the 3"", but honestly I think Sexton is gonna end up being a high-level sixth man anyway. Play Cade at the 2, it's a more natural position for him defensively and he can still playmake next to Darius Garland as a shoot-first PG"
Darius garland
Darius Garland might be really good.
"I’m looking at Darius Garland in Cleveland. I think along with Michael Porter, people sleep on them because of their injuries. Porter has broke out a bit and I expect Garland to be the next one.  I’m also looking at Cam Reddish to breakthrough in Atlanta. He has all the talent and has improved each year"
&gt; For Darius Garland  *closes article*
"I could see one of Colin Sexton or Darius Garland to the Celtics. Cavs have seen that Sexland is not the future, can’t win with two undersized guards. Celtics need a new guard and they have the draft assets to get one. Cavs want to get out from under the Love contract, and maybe he tries harder on a contender.   Kemba and two lotto-protected firsts (2021, 2023) for Colin Sexton and Kevin Love?"
"2019 who?  Zion, Barrett, and many others.  I thought THAT was the loaded class?  Only Ja Morant looks like a world beater.  Darius Garland, Jarrett Culver, Coby White, etc.  &amp;#x200B;  2017 doesn't look that bad but its not good either."
Darius Garland
"Darius Garland should be up there imo, at least on the honorable mentions."
"Ja Morant isn't already a star though. Next season is when he shows if he's a star or not and takes it to the next level. He's having a good playoffs, like Jamal Murray. Doesn't make them stars.   Based off what would you say Darius Garland isn't above an average starter? Garland shot 45% from the field and 39% from 3.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/moranja01.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/garlada01.html  Ja does more as he has the ball in his hands more not playing with a Sexton and a better roster and coach. They aren't crazy far apart in most categories.   I also have watched a good amount of Ja as he actually gets TV. How many times did you see Garland this year?   This isn't my first time making this statement. I'm standing by it and we'll see. Hopefully they'll be pointing this out in a couple years."
Darius Garland will be better than Ja Morant.
Is Darius Garland  still Better than this guy?
Darius Garland
Shoutout to that Ja vs Darius Garland thread and everyone posting his off nights every single game. So overrated
"Wrong:  - I thought Jordan Poole had no future in the NBA  - I was really impressed with Herro after the bubble, but he hasn't shown any of the improved IQ, passing, and feel that he showed there  - I thought Lamelo would be terrible for at least a year or two  - Didn't have a strong opinion on him, but I'm generally surprised at how good Darius Garland has been this season  Right:  - I feel very validated for singing Haliburton's praises since we'll before the draft  - Can Reddish and Jarret Culver still look like flaming busts  - I thought Thybulle would be an incredible defender even before he was drafted, although I didn't expect his offense to be this much of a struggle. Still don't understand why he dropped so far  - I thought the Raptors should have drafted Tillman"
Darius Garland and Kevin Porter Jr are not that good. They are young players averaging decent counting stats on weak efficiency with little defense on two completely terrible teams.  There is no world where a team is better with Garland than Derrick Rose.
Somebody tried to argue with me that he was worse than Darius Garland and I got downvoted. Foh
There was a thread with people calling Darius Garland better than Ja lol.   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ms5p8y/2nd_year_pg_stats_garland_and_morant/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body
"I dunno if Lamelo, Edward's and Garland should be top 80 yet.   The sample size for Lamelo is still so small(obviously the potential is there) but still an inconsistent scorer who can be t/p prone. I think he'll be a top 15-20 player before long but ouff. Early in the in the season Edward's wasn't great, near the end is when he came on. I'm taking Jrue over both these guys easy.    Darius is good but top 80 is tough, I'm more willing to concede him belonging than the other two. I'm not high on either of the backcourt guards in Cleveland tbh."
Not to mention FVV lonzo rozier shai dlo as well.  He’s kinda like Darius garland but not young lol
"Where are you getting the Lonzo comparison?  I plugged in the range Schroeder hit during that stretch of season into the NBA stats page and found if he could stretch out those numbers (16-20 points, 6-10 assists) during a full season his peers would be FVV, Ja, Jrue, Darius Garland, Lowry, CP3, and Mike Conley.  I’m not saying he affects winning like Lowry, CP3, or Conley; but *if Schroeder could stretch that production to a full season* he has a statistical argument for being a top 12-15 PG"
Darius Garland has size 25 shoes.
Thybulle isn’t much older than Hunter.  Darius Garland is more than two years younger than both.
Lemme see some Darius Garland as a victory cigar
"They have Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland and a high pick. They also seem poised to get some good players or picks back from Sexton. I don’t know if they’re building a contender necessarily, but I do think they could build a playoff team fairly easily."
"They’ve already selected the majority of the team, which means they’ve already contacted a load of people who already told them “no” once, so the list is already narrowed down to other Select Team and cut Senior Team members. Keldon already earned a promotion over all but two other select team members (Saddiq Bey and Darius Garland joined him on the team) and has been practicing with the team for weeks already.  On top of that, the Olympics opening ceremonies start 5 days after their last scrimmage which is this Sunday (and realistically the ceremonies start 4 days after their last game since they have to cross the international date line).   Are you really that surprised that they moved quickly on this one? In this day and age, it is not complicated to contact a list of 10-20 people (spitballing a number there) and get responses back within one day. Especially considering the aforementioned fact that Johnson is already in game shape and has been practicing with the team for weeks? He’s not even the 30th option for this last roster spot if all conditions were ideal, but these conditions are pretty obviously not ideal."
Why on earth would the cavs trade Collin and take Suggs? Darius Garland exists
Darius Garland in shambles
Keldon was part of the select team so he's already in game shape. He's actually played well with the team in the exhibition games compared to Darius Garland who was also part of the select team playing with them. There was a noticeable drop off when Garland was in there while Keldon held his own. I was listening to a Kerr interview and he said the biggest thing is to find someone in game condition especially with the Olympics coming up so quickly. It's more likely that the players they tried calling have been relaxing during their break.
I hope they bring up Darius garland
"Ideal?  PG: Cade Cunningham; Darius Garland; Matthew Dellavedova  SG: Steph Curry; Colin Sexton; Dylan Windler  SF: LeBron James; Isaac Okoro; Cedi Osman  PF: Larry Nance Jr; Dean Wade;   C: Jarrett Allen; Isaiah Hartenstein;  Definitely ECF, probably winning another ring"
"Veteran players like killian Hayes, Kelvin johnson and Darius garland?"
But Darius Garland was?!?!
"&gt; Keldon Johnson, Darius garland, and saddiq bey to the reserve team.  What the heck. And no Trae, Zion, or Ja?"
"Kevin Love, Jerami Grant, Darius Garland, yea sure why not Tobias Harris too in the same vein."
"They have Kevin love on the team and invited Keldon Johnson, Darius garland, and saddiq bey to the reserve team. Them not even reaching out to Ja is simply bad recruiting on their part"
Yall are saying darius garland but gonna be talking when they lose
Darius Garland maybe?? Please
Darius Garland please 🙏
"Darius Garland will be among three guys promoted to Team USA for the team’s exhibition games, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic.   Keldon Johnson and Saddiq Bey will also join Garland, as the trio will replace Devin Booker, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday up until the conclusion of the NBA Finals.  source : https://fortyeightminutes.com/darius-garland-among-select-team-players-promoted-to-team-usa/"
Had no idea Darius Garland was called up for this game
"Darius Garland, Keldon Johnson, and Saddiq Bey"
Really nice game from Darius Garland so far
"Darius Garland, they have what’s called a select team for the main team to practice against and also as backups and stuff for when there are injuries or guys still playing in the NBA."
Darius garland is good but relax on him. He ain’t there yet. Colin considering what he been going through in that team has still improved. If the Cavs really wanna be good. They need to package  those picks and maybe garland to land somebody already on a contract.
"Sexton is a workhorse and the Cavs might regret trading him. But that's a bigger speculation compared to Darius Garland having a higher upside. Garland makes the Cavs' offense click and his teammates better or at least he's better than Sexton in this regard.   They're both horrendous on defense. But it's easier to create strategies to hide one of them as compared to both on the defensive end, especially if they'll be playing on big money in the near future."
"If the rumors are true, then that means they probably believe Darius Garland is a much better fit to run the offense they want. No one said they are right, but that could be their belief. Also looking at PPG in a vacuum is not really meaningful."
"We’re giving Keldon Johnson and Darius Garland minutes right now, with Booker/Holiday/Middleton not on the team yet. Not like this is the full strength squad either."
"Give Garland more run. There’s zero proof he can’t be the catalyst to winning. In fact, there’s only proof that NOT playing Darius Garland is a catalyst to losing."
Darius Garland is literally right there
"Breakout: Nicolas Claxton, Cam Reddish, Darius Garland(if they trade Sexton)  Fall off: Julius Randle, Lebron(injuries and old age are piling on him) and Klay Thompson(if his injuries zap his full star power)"
Darius Garland will break out and Klay Thompson might not be considered a fall off but I think the injuries are really gonna affect him
All of our wings and guards besides Collin Sexton and Darius Garland are pretty bad
Darius Garland is the best playmaker on the team and he got all of five minutes.
I swear to god Darius Garland is good usually
Sadiq Bey and Darius Garland 😂
"Nigeria played much more cohesively and looked really good out there.  Some other comments:  - I’m slightly biased but they should start Draymond over Bam but it’s mainly because he’s played together with KD before, can be a playmaker, and also just run some of the Steph stuff with Dame.  - Darius Garland looked lost out there. He’s not part of the main team but it’s going to be hard for 3 new players to be added when the rest of the team is looking for chemistry.  - I’d rather the team lose now when it doesn’t count so they know what to work on. I think there defense will be much better when the olympics start. Zach Levine had an injury scare and I think the players just want to make it through these games healthy."
Why did Saddiq Bey and Darius Garland play?
Darius Garland is gonna drag the U.S.A to the gold. He's the black Steve Nash.
The disrespect for  Darius Garland
I say we give his minutes to Darius Garland!
Darius garland wasn’t the problem lol
When I saw Darius Garland get minutes I had a bad feeling about this game.
Darius Garland slander that man wasn't doing shit on defense.
Oh man if Darius Garland became the reason why team USA doesn’t lose this game.
Get Darius Garland out of this game man
Darius Garland making a fool of himself out there.
Bums like Jerami Grant and Darius Garland repping USA makes me sad
I’d rather see Darius garland at the 5 right now than love
"Darius ""The Deviant"" Garland -down for SexLand but won't accept the chance at LoveLand in Vegas."
darius garland did 9/11
I do watch the team. I know they have the worst spacing in the league. I know it’s not controversial to say I’d rather have DeAndre Hunter or Darius Garland over Jaxson hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker.
Well considering RJ was the second best player on a 4 seed in the East and Garland was the second best tank commander.. I'd say RJ is head and shoulders above Darius already and considering that he is younger has more upside.
"Homer take: Darius Garland. He came into the league barely playing in College and didn’t get a full rookie season.   He’s smooth and needs confidence for his jumper to become other worldly.   I don’t anticipate him becoming Steph, but I do believe if he believes on himself he has all the tools."
Darius Garland duh
there’s more darius garland experts in this thread than people at any given cavs game. dudes are acting like he’s iverson lol
Darius Garland
"Darius Garland, RJ is a way better defender but on the offensive, I think Garland is better at everything with shooting, playmaking,finishing, and ball handling. There is a reason cavs are keeping him and letting their best player in Collin Sexton be in trade talks."
Darius Garland
"**Darius Garland**  He’s in a Steph-Monta situation with Colin Sexton where he’s a better player but Sexton is technically the franchise player.   Just like with the old Warriors, this undersized, doesn’t play defense backcourt isn’t working out. Trading away Sexton could bring back a good player who isn’t detrimental to Garland’s growth  A Steph Curry leap probably won’t happen but he could become much better"
Darius garland is still a rising all star and they have allen Sexton and okoro on the come up as well.
"At the time, it was Trae Young + a No. 1 pick for Luka Doncic. Depending on where the balls fell, that could have been Rui Hachimura or Darius Garland. The Mavs pick really dropped during the lottery, so all things considered, the Hawks did well, but not nearly as well as they could have got for that haul."
Anthony Edwards and Darius garland would be a sweet back court
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
As a Cavs fan people keep telling us that you can’t play with Collin Sexton and Darius Garland together on the same team cause it might be like CJ McCollum and Dame.  ...how fuckin cool would it be for our young guys we develop to be as good as CJ and Dame???  That would be AWESOME
"Being a shitty team with upside is nice.  Like we’ve got Collin Sexton, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, they’re exciting.  But right now I have no stakes in the playoffs.  I’m rooting for Ty Lue above anyone else haha."
"Darius Garland. He missed his entire year in college due to injury so its no surprise that he wasn't a significant contributor in year one, but he flashed a genuinely special combo of handling/shooting/passing this year. I think he's going to surprise a ton of people in year three as he continues to develop."
Darius Garland maybe
"Just a rumor, there’s no real tension or concern about them coexisting that I know of yet, but [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/cavaliersnation.com/2021/06/06/report-several-nba-people-prefer-darius-garland-over-collin-sexton/amp/) is an example."
"&gt; but I know their front office has said they would prefer to keep Darius Garland over Collin Sexton given the choice.  This isn't intended as sarcasm or anything, it's just that this really is new to me, could you give me a link? lol"
"Hayward, Eric Gordon, Darius Garland, Gary Harris, Teague, Conley, George Hill are the notable current ones that come to mind"
"It was ruined by injury, but Darius Garland really improved his game from last year."
"Darius Garland and Deandre Hunter, Garland genuinely looks like he is the point guard of the future when completely healthy, and Hunter is just special man"
"Lol bigger size doesn't automatically mean more positions  He would get absolutely exposed on defense by small quick guards like Jalen Brunson or Darius Garland, let alone premier starting guards like Kyrie or De'Aaron  I'd imagine he is more of a wing on the defensive end"
"Yeah lmao we dropped from possibly having Ja Morant and LaMelo Ball to Darius Garland and Isacc Okoro. I love our young guys but that's a significant difference. A top 3 pick has a good chance of netting you a star, a 5 pick has a much better chance of getting you a good role player."
"Draymond Green said a few days ago that he’s one of the toughest players to guard - “that kid is so fast. It’s rough getting switched onto Darius Garland.” Bradley Beal also says that he’s destined for greatness. I think he can be super elite on offence, but his defence needs improvement. This kid is only 21 years old!!!Give me a player that you can realistically see as his ceiling - I see glimpses of Beal or Kyrie in his game"
"You obviously watch 0 cavs basketball  Darius Garland is better than you realize same with Larry Nance Jr  Do not want KP, even if it's a swap for Love (longer contract)"
"2019 was a different draft. No one was really clamoring for De'Ander Hunter, Darius Garland and Jarret Culver...it was really a three player draft. 2021 is seen as a four player draft so the 4th pick has a ton more value."
Who on the Cavs is a #1 lottery talent? Their highest pick was #5 (Darius Garland) in a draft class that was considered subpar after Ja and Zion
"I think there's about 10 or so teams that would be interested, I may be considering Simmons' value a little high here but he's still a top 5 defender, phenomenal playmaker so it is what it is/ I could see the Sixers being interested in the following:  Simmons for Hayward  Simmons, Shake and Isaiah Joe for Kevin Love and Darius Garland  Simmons, George Hill for Westbrook  Simmons for Porzingis  Simmons, George Hill for John Wall   Simmons for Dlo  Simmons for Ingram  Simmons for Kemba (but you know OKC will want a pick lol)  Simmons for CJ  Simmons for either Buddy Hield or Fox (unsure who they'd want more, so unsure how to make cap work  Simmons for (somebody on the Spurs - Derozen maybe? If ANYONE can figure out how to ""fix"" Simmons, it's Pop)"
I'm thinking a core deal centered around Kevin Love+Darius Garland for Ben Simmons
Kevin Love and Darius Garland from Cleveland
Probably needs to go to a smaller market to build some semblance of confidence back.   Might not be the best fit overall but realistically I see him going to a team like Cleveland for Kevin Love+Darius Garland
Hot Take and my opinion: Darius Garland is better then Colin Sexton.
"I hope you burn in eternal hell for the sins you’ve committed upon this world. Fuck you, Darius Garland, and Collin Sexton your poverty ass team"
"He’s definitely not top 10, but Darius Garland had a really underrated year 2. If I were the Cavs, I’d probably be higher on him than Sexton, actually."
It’s not even the adams trade imo.   Choosing Hayes over Darius garland is one of the dumbest moves I’ve ever seen come draft night and Ive heard of GMs picking Jabari Parker over embiid.
Where’s my man Darius Garland with some holiday cheer?
"Darius garland, kevin porter, keldon johnson, derrick white, and jordan poole seem like good bets maybe dejounte"
Darius Garland will make great improvements this year I believe
"you’re taking 45 games in a bubble year  plus Murray is 2 years older. he was at 18.6 on 45/34/88 at Sexton’s age when he was being set-up by the best passer in the NBA    and 3ppg is a big difference. like i said, Brandon Ingram didn’t do that. Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, and Khris Middleton didn’t do that    Murray had a true outlier year in terms of shooting last year. 45 games of shooting hot is not enough to refute 4 years of league average shooting. last year was the first time Sexton was below league average   and he should have more assists than Sexton😂 he’s passing to Jeremy Grant, Michael Porter Jr, and the MVP  Sexton is passing to Andre Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, and Larry Nance.   and you’re talking about peak, but Murray is 2 years older. watch that Nets game from this year for players at their peak. Sexton’s entire career is coming up big in big time moments"
"Idiotic trades all around.  Especially when the ""rumors"" are now that Cavs are working on an extension with Sexton.   not to be confused with the ""rumors"" before the draft that they were trading him, but this was before we picked up Mobley, which makes all the trade talk about trading our #1 scorer and best player on the team moot.  ""Evan Dammarell of Fear the Sword and WKYC Channel 3 is reporting that the Cavaliers have put extending Sexton as a plan back on the table. More importantly, according to his report, Sexton wants to stay in Cleveland and continue the work that he’s doing with Darius Garland, and Jarrett Allen.""  from last week: https://factoryofsadness.co/2021/08/11/cavs-rumor-collin-sexton-extension-offer-back-table/"
Darius garland if he’s still coached by jb because his system is pnr based
Pro tip don’t trade up for Darius Garland if you aren’t even sure the pick your trading up for can get you Darius Garland next time
"Trae hits 47.4% of his floaters, not exactly an efficient shot.    https://www.google.com/amp/s/kingjamesgospel.com/2021/06/17/cleveland-cavaliers-trae-youngs-floaters-key-darius-garland/amp/"
Darius Garland and Collin Sexton in the 3pt contest please 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼
"There's more as well, that was just off the top of my head.  Darius Garland is another one."
Darius Garland is confused why he’s on this list
"I don't know if you remember, but the Wolves traded up to try to grab Darius Garland and everyone was confounded when Cleveland took Garland one spot ahead of him.  They were forced to take Culver as BPA."
"I don't know if you remember, but the Wolves traded up to try to grab Darius Garland and everyone was confounded when Cleveland took Garland one spot ahead of him.  They were forced to take Culver as BPA."
Darius Garland or Cole Anthony
Darius Garland &gt; RJ Barrett
"My immediate thought after reading this was ""I wonder if Garland is a Klutch client?""  Sure enough, [he is](https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2019/06/20/darius-garland-of-klutch-sports-selected-at-no-5-in-nba-draft-by-the-cleveland-cavaliers/)."
Darius Garland  Keldon Johnson  Patrick Williams  Jonathan Isaac
"&gt;“Darius Garland actually,” [Draymond] Green said on “Warriors Roundtable” on 95.7 The Game when asked about the toughest players to guard. “And I know that’s probably an unpopular opinion. That kid is so fast, so herky-jerky and he can shoot the ball. When he really figures out how good he truly is.  &gt;“I hate getting switched onto him. It’s rough getting switched onto Darius Garland.”"
"Darius Garland. He has everything you want a modern guard to have, but he's had a hard time putting it all together on a consistent basis... But God if he ever does he's going to be a problem."
Darius Garland
"Pretty comical to see guys like Darius Garland, Markelle Fultz, Devin Vassell and Okeke with more upvotes than Tyrese. I guess as a Kings fan I’ve seen so much of him and know how much better he is than those guys that it didn’t occur to me the league really doesn’t know how good he will be yet."
"Collin Sexton and Darius Garland will be two of the best guards in the league in 5 years time. You can call me a homer all you want but i’ve seen all but probably 10 Cavs games over the last two seasons and those two are something different. The main thing that sets them apart is their work ethic and mentality, they’re always working accepting of their flaws and willing to work at it. I’m not sure if they can both reach their full potential together, but god i fucking hope so."
Davion Mitchell or Darius garland
Darius Garland.
I think if bulls end up a top 4 seed and Lonzo plays to the tune of 15/8/7  he will win provided he keeps them afloat defensively too and there aren't that many contenders.My pick would be Darius Garland if the Cavs do move sexton and he averages like 20/8/3 on 40pct from three.Dejounte could be another contender or literally any of lonnie walker him or keldon johnson from spurs tbh..i think whoever average 20 amongst them wins
"Christian Wood, Darius Garland, RJ Barrett are a few that come to mind"
It's crazy how much hate he gets from our fans. Everyone assumes you have to pick him or Garland(now isn't the time for that); yet people would rather roll the dice on what Darius may become instead of what  Collin already is.
"Darius garland is a top 15-10 point guard and MIP next season, scoring 22 ppg, 8asts, and maybe 2 rebounds on 45/40/90."
Darius garland for MIP isn't even a crazy take. He was balling last season. I can easily see it happen.
"Darius Garland.  Theres been a lot of discussion about Sexton, but Garland is quietly ascending in ways that will make him a serious star for a long time."
"Darius Garland MIP. Mobley looks like the second coming of KG, but undeservingly loses ROY to Cade."
Darius Garland
Darius Garland will be an all star next season.
Collin Sexton is a better player than Darius Garland.
"Cam Reddish  Romeo Langford or Aaron Nesmith (probably just one of those 2)  Darius Garland (maybe he's too good or obvious for that list)  PJ Dozier  Malik Monk  Jaren Jackson Jr. (think this is the year he turns it around)  Tyrese Maxey  Kira Lewis or Nickeil Alexander Walker (same as the Boston guys, not sure they can both breakout at the same time)  Malachi Flynn"
Darius Garland
"You can’t just decide to spend more money on players in free agency. There’s a big gap between the (soft) salary cap and the tax line. The only way to spend a significant amount on taxes is if you’re re-signing your players to big contracts using their bird rights. Most teams don’t have players that are good enough to be worth spending into the luxury tax for.   Cleveland could max out a backcourt of Darius Garland and Collin Sexton. That plus Jarrett Allen and the rest of the team would put them into the tax, and it would also be a terrible basketball move because once you’re in the tax you can’t easily improve the team and that team isn’t even necessarily a playoff team"
Darius Garland
"major homer take, but i feel like that’s the biggest difference between him and Darius Garland  Trae gets to the line as well as anybody ever"
Darius Garland  Maybe Isaac Okoro…
"Darius Garland. He already took a huge leap last year and displayed what he can do as a pure point guard/playmaker. Since then he has been playing on the USA select team scrimmaging against the best in the world all summer. And, they just gave him Evan Mobley to run pick and roll with. Look"
darius garland or keldon johnson
"Darius Garland. He already broke out, but I think he’ll break out more."
"Very creative way to frame this.   Here are some thoughts.   I’m not sure it’s fair to call both Sexton and Garland “small scorers”. Darius projects to be a solid point guard.   Is Wall not the best player on the Rockets? I’ve seen some fans say he’s not very good, but others claim he’s not been impacted much by the Achilles injury.   I think Orlando might have a worse record than the Rockets, and maybe even OKC. I say this because Orlando has less talent on the roster than both Houston and the Thunder do. Presti may be dedicated to tanking, but Shai will win you games.  Great post!"
Draymond Green  Darius Garland  Danny Green  Danilo Galinari  …  Devonte’ Graham
I thought Darius Garland for some reason
i thought OP meant Darius Garland lol
"34 years old Damian Lillard.   Lamelo LaFrance Ball, assuming Hornets don't find the success they envisioned.  Or any PG from Klutch (Ben Simmons, Trae Young, Darius Garland)  I'm just thinking of PGs for AD, hoping he stays."
"PG: Darius Garland/ KPJ SG: SGA SF: Cade Cunningham  PF: Jerami Grant C: Jonathan Isaac or Jarrett Allen  Being hopeful here that Cade is as advertised and what Isaac showed before getting hurt is real. I think this lineup is good enough for at least a second round appearance assuming they don’t run into 76ers, Bucks, or Nets.   Coaching is the real difference maker here"
rubio does not deserve to be a backup to darius garland
"basically the only players we have developed in the past few years are Collin Sexton, Darius Garland and Isaac Okoro... they're all developing well?  Okoro could be better but he's not bad.  Idk wtf you want from us.  Are you upset Dylan Windler isn't good enough???"
darius garland
Darius Garland  Dude has one of the prettiest strokes and has excellent court vision. Wouldn't be surprised if he averages 20 and 7 this season.
"Plus/minus is not at all a consistent metric for defining one single player's impact when they're on the court.   Using that logic we can conclude that Bradley Beal, De'Aaron Fox, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Victor Oladipo, LaMelo Ball, Russell Westbrook, Buddy Hield and Zach LaVine are not NBA caliber talent, correct? After all, they all have a negative +/- on the season"
Allegedly the Wolves fell into that too. They traded up to get Darius Garland but the Cavs took him at 5 and they had to take Jarrett Culver.
"So did LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Collin Sexton, Darius Garland, and Isaac Okoro"
"for the low, low price of #3, a Rocket Mortgage handover, and Darius Garland"
"I am really high on Darius Garland, but there's not much more upside in cavs roster. Shai."
Trade KPJ for....  Darius Garland?
Nic Claxton  Darius Garland  De’Andre Hunter  Daniel Gafford  Romeo Langford (just because I want it to happen)
facts. danny green is danny green lol. and no one gives too hot shites about darius garland right now except for cavs fans and super bball nerds like me who think cavs should go all in on garland and get a decent haul for sexton
fr... DG is Danny Green and even Darius Garland nowadays
Darius Garland
"""top 3"" So..... Zion, Ja, and Jordan Poole? For reference, this ranks Jordan Poole above: RJ Barret, Deandre Hunter, Darius Garland, and Tyler Herro. Those four are ***definitely*** above Poole, and most would have talents like KPJ and Keldon Johnson ahead of him too."
Darius Garland
"The cavs have a point guard. His name is Darius Garland. The cavs aren’t letting Allen dictate who they pick. You don’t draft for fit at 3, you draft BPA. They can move Allen if the fit doesn’t work."
"Darius Garland is their best player. And how do you judge a fictional trade without knowing what they’re getting back for Sexton? If he’s good enough for you to make this comment than he presumably is good enough to net a valuable return, no?"
Pretty sure Houston &gt; Darius Garland lol
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
MVP: Luka because I'm biased  ROTY: Jalen Green  DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo  6MOY: Danilo Gallinari  MIP: Darius Garland  COY: Rick Carlisle
"He's due for a contract extension and he wants more than they think he's worth. Sort of like the John Collins situation. In addition, they have a better point guard in Darius Garland and they decided that Garland is probably their PG of the future ahead of Sexton."
Darius Garland Most Improved Player
"Saunders was a Glen Taylor decision. It is widely known that Rosas wanted Finch (our current coach) the entire time.  We traded up to pick Darius Garland, who the Cavaliers were not expected to pick, and ended up taking Culver after Garland was off the board.  Traded for Dlo to get rid of Wiggins who was considered one of the worst contracts in the entire league at the time. This trade also appeased our star player who happens to be the best shooting center of all time.  Got anything else stupid to say?"
"""And you know, now that I talk about Darius Garland, you know who he reminds me of? Larry Bird. I remember one time I walked into the Celtics locker room in '84 and said 'Hey Lar, great shooting tonight.' He looked at me and gave me the same smirk he always does when he has a hot night, almost as if to say 'Did you expect anything different?' I always loved Larry's confidence, he always thought he was the best player on the court, even when he was playing against guys like Magic and Michael. And I kinda like that Garland is also a good shooter."""
Darius Garland plays a bit like Kyrie. He’s a worse shooter but better passer imo
"I too, love Darius Garland."
Darius Garland  Pat Connaughton  Isaac Okoro  Maxi Kleber  Jakob Poetl
"This isn't just limited to a small markets. A lot of players don't live in the city but in the surrounding suburbs. When I lived in the East Bay I used to see Oakland A's, Oakland Raiders and Golden State Warriors players in the wild a lot. Well I also used to be a lounge host at a local restaurant/nightclub So I probably interacted with more than normal.  Not only would you meet the local players but also they would come after a game with friends from other teams. Tom Tolbert used to bring Sean Elliott to the club after games. I ID'd Mitch Richmond his rookie year with the Warriors. I had a fun conversation with Winston Garland, Darius Garland's dad who used to be a starting point guard for the Warriors. Outside of nightclub though, I ran into Dennis Eckersley and his wife at a hardware store in Dublin California. So there was a lot of that."
God I wish I had a borderline all star like Jakob Poertl on the Cavs instead of a prospect like Darius Garland
"My Depth Chart would probably be:   PG: Steph Curry (Superstar), Darius Garland  SG: Paul George (All-Star), Marcus Smart, Danny Green  SF: Jayson Tatum (All-Star), Mikal Bridges   PF: Draymond Green, OG Anunoby, Thaddeus Young  C: Anthony Davis (Superstar), Richaun Holmes   I feel like this would be an almost perfect blend of shooting, self creation, passing, and defense throughout the entire team."
I disagree with J Kidd and Payton but you could convince me on the other ones. Also Darius Garland should be on that list
1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter 5. Darius Garland 6. Tyler Herro 7. Matisse Thybulle 8. Kevin Porter Jr. 9. Rui Hachimura 10. Keldon Johnson 11. PJ Washington 12. Luguentz Dort 13. Cameron Johnson 14. Brandon Clarke
Darius Garland
DeAndre Hunter  Kevin Porter Jr  Darius Garland  Terrance Mann  I also think everybody is right about NAW.
Darius Garland seems to be on track for that
Darius Garland is gonna be better than Ja Morant
"Sexton is his normal tank self. Drummond is also a tank - a septic tank.  Darius Garland is the one who has put on a hundred pounds of muscle and grown 6"" during the offseason."
"Darius ""Ice Cube Jr."" Garland is gonna be great in this league"
"REPORT: the Cavaliers have traded Kevin Pangos, Colin Sexton, and Darius Garland for Ben Simmons and Andre Drummond"
hes friends with Darius Garland
I hope so. I find him to be the scum of the earth. I absolutely hate that he represents Darius Garland.
This is Darius garland. He’s great at being a communicator and playing help defense but every time I see a screen I fear for his life.
Darius Garland is shifty and has improved his outside shooting. I could compare him to Kyrie without the elite finishing
"The Pelicans got a great return for both AD and Jrue Holiday when they traded them, but it's just reality that they've already squandered a big portion of what they got, and it started almost immediately. The Lakers gave them the 4th pick in the 2019 draft, which they could have used on DeAndre Hunter or Darius Garland, but instead they traded it for Jaxon Hayes and NAW. They've now let Lonzo go with an extremely questionable return, and they traded away another first round pick they got from the Lakers to unload Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe. This was after wasting picks and other assets to get Steven Adams in the first place, of course. They're a poorly run team so it's no wonder their star players always want out."
That also rules out the Cavs. The reason Sexton is even remotely available is because Darius Garland plays point.
Darius Garland.
By this time next year Darius Garland will be taller than K Love. Dude needs to get with the program and start growing.
"I specifically went to the Cavs game in San Antonio last year just to see him, been following him since high school.   Came for Sexton, stayed for Darius Garland. He made me a fan after seeing him live"
"Sixers can’t get a star for Simmons.  I don’t think they can get two firsts, either (let alone the haul of picks they want).  Maybe they could pull Darius Garland.  Maybe.  Simmons is not a star player."
Darius Garland in 3 years lol
"An outstanding job, that's what!  What the heck are you on about?  3 bigs - Mobley JAllen and Markannen - for 2 positions.  2 of them can shoot, and 2 of them can defend.  The one who can do both needs some development time.  Sprinkle a little DWade in there.  Darius Garland will be the first guy from this group to be an allstar.  No, it wont be Sexton.  Long term Sexton might be the starting shooting guard, or (more likely) the 6th man.  Dylan Windler and Isaac Okoro are going to surprise the hell out of people.  Pay attention.  This team is on track to be scary as hell before long!"
Darius Garland and Collin Sexton
Darius Garland.
"darius garland is the new steve nash, very similar play styles"
"Darius Garland replicates prime Isaiah Thomas and becomes an MVP candidate within the next three years  Kevin Porter Jr. matures, improves, and becomes a consistent all star"
"Been saying this for a while.  Rich Paul is so bad for the league.  His strategy is always the same.  ""Leave your team, get as much money as you can elsewhere, turn down any qualifying offers.""  So now you have all these players shuffling around between teams in search of a few extra bucks.  Lost in the shuffle is all the guys who could've taken a good offer to stay with their original team, but didn't, and then didn't get a better offer and ended up out of the league instead or in a terrible situation.  League looks completely different every year, part of it is because of superteams and the impact of the salary cap, but a large part of it is Paul telling his guys to fuck over their home teams.  I'm on the Cavs train and I'm kinda worried because we've made Darius Garland the centerpiece of our future, but he's with Rich Paul, so for all we know he's gonna just book it off to LA in a few years because he can make more $$$ there."
"Let’s keep going down the line Jordan Clarkson, Trey Lyles, Eric Bledsoe, Darius Garland, Talen Horton Tucker, Dion Waiters…a homeless person could have done those right?"
Darius Garland
The Cavs fan base is watching Darius garland very closely right now because he seems to have grown like 2-3 inches over the summer
Collin sexton  Darius garland  Evan Mobley  Jarrett Allen   Okoro or Nance Jr(for the bench)  They can have Love.
"????   AD, Trae Young, Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Draymond Green, THT, KCP, Gary Trent Jr, Tyrese Maxes, Darius Garland, and many more  They have other clients and most have been paid."
"KCP got paid every year though.   Jordan Clarkson got paid.   Tristan got Paid. Gary Trent JR..Paid.  Terrence Ross, Dejounte Murray.  Marcus Morris had a great deal from the Spurs but Marcus turned it down.   Mikes Bridges, Darius Garland…all got paid well.    So where is this narrative that if you’re not a star e doesn’t get you paid?"
Fake data that came from the nba itself? 💀  This is copium dude.  Collin sexton and Darius Garland are the only shot creators on their team. Cole Anthony is the only playmaker on his team.
"Thanks for the info!   Per your source, Kyrie was doubled less than Darius Garland and Cole Anthony. I think that's pretty interesting."
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
RemindMe! 5 years  My 2025 top 20 list:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Jayson Tatum  3. Trae Young  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Donovan Mitchell  7. Ja Morant  8. De'Aaron Fox  9.

"Darius Garland - 6'3""  Collin Sexton - 6'1""  Lauri Markkanen - 7'  Evan Mobley - 7'  Jarrett Allen - 6'11""  **Average height: 6'6ish**"
"Sure, but 2 seasons is still a better sample than 5 so it’ll take a while for those assessments to be incorrect.  And while I wouldn’t say the Pelicans have the most dire future, the constant questions regarding Zion definitely play a role in that. Between the constant rumours that he wants out, him being reported at a pretty absurd weight, being injury prone, etc.  And you gotta admit David griffin has made some questionable decisions over his time with the pels so far. The AD trade was great, y’all had little leverage but still got a haul for a disgruntled star entering the last year of his deal. That big jrue holiday trade? Meh. Y’all got Bledsoe Adams and 2 picks from a contender. Bledsoe and Adams were awful fits with the team even before they played together, and the team then extended Adams on an overpay of a contract before seeing them play together. Then he traded both of those bad contracts with a pick to move down in the draft and get valancunis, who also doesn’t fit at all with Zion. Jaxon Hayes seems like a whiff with a top ten pick and I’m sure either Darius Garland or Deandre Hunter would’ve been better than him + NAW, and you had that pick in the first place. Then you let Lonzo go, who’s become pretty much the perfect role playing point guard with room to grow and was close with Zion.   Far from the most dire future but plenty of questionable decisions that will naturally draw scrutiny"

The only reason people care about the Cavs is because it's LeBron's hometown team.  They have everything your average lottery team has but in a less exciting way.  They have a couple dynamic guards that could drop 30 any given night... but they're Collin Sexton and Darius Garland.  They have a fancy rotation they go to for the nerds to get excited... but it's just Lauri Markkanen starting at SF.  They have a meme player that people like who's actually a solid NBA pro... but it's just Cedi Osman.  They snatched a franchise changing player via the greatest draft class in recent memory... but it's a bigman.
That list had Horton Tucker ahead of Darius Garland. I wouldn’t pay any mind to it. I agree though SGA is underrated
That's some wholesome excitement from Darius Garland
"Lonnie Walker, Darius Garland."
"I have a Sixers flair, but I also root for them and it's really frustrating to watch. Basically every step of the way I've disagreed with Grif.  \#4 pick in 2019, you're right Hunter would've been a good pick, and I also liked Darius Garland there. Zo isn't a great halfcourt creator, Garland's handles and shooting would've been great for them making a Garland/Zo/BI/Zion core all 24 and younger. In the trade down, while I liked the NAW pickup I hated picking Hayes so high.  Jrue trade was good value at the time, but Griff messed a lot of it up. I wanted to keep Hill but instead he chose Bledsoe. He brings back Steven Adams, I knew immediately it was a bad idea to give him an extension. Now we had to make moves to get off those contracts, while Hill actually returned value to OKC while also having mentorship and stable PG ability to help the young guys in the meantime.  The Lonzo move I thought was god awful, I hated the SVG hiring, the list goes on I've literally been left complaining about nearly every move Griff makes. The craziest part of it all? The fanbase somehow comes back to supporting his crazy shit over-and-over again. They defended the Adams' extension, they defended SVG's hiring, they defended Bledsoe's acquisition over Hill, now you'll see them go berserk on anti-Zo stuff. They eventually come around to the fact that every one of those moves were really bad, but then go on to defend the next thing Griff does only to repeat that cycle.  It has nothing to do with how they've started the season, I've had all these takes along the way."
Darius Garland has been like this.  Evan Mobley has had strong passing.  Throw in Rubio and yea you’re gonna have a lot of assists.

"Really fun game.  Takeaways:  Cavs:  - Mobley is a fucking beast. First NBA game and dropping 17/9/6 on efficient shooting and with insane defense? - Jarrett Allen is a force in the paint, and with Mobley feeding him looks and clogging up the paint with him it looks like we have the frontcourt of our future. - Cedi Osman giveth and Cedi Osman taketh.  - Darius Garland looks legit but he still needs to work on his vision and aggressiveness. - We're suffering from a massive hole at wing which makes it impossible for us to run a decent rotation. We're either throwing out 3 6 footers or 3 7 footers, there's no in between lol  Grizzlies:  - Ja Morant.  - Desmond Bane looked incredible today.  - Melton was on fire, but not too surprised given the state of our perimeter D  - Did I mention Ja Morant?  - Glad to see Ziaire get out there and make an impact immediately.  - JJJ had a rough game offensively, especially inside, but made a huge impact on D. Dude is so good.  All around fun game!"
Darius Garland
I forgot Darius Garland🤦🏼
Darius Garland
"""Darius Garland lobs it to Evan Mobley who THROWS THE HAMMA DOWN""  I'm really looking forward to Austin Carr having more things to get excited about."

Darius Garland should have a great year
"4 inches for Collin Sexton, 2 inches for Darius Garland, then everybody shuts up about Sexland"
Darius Garland will show to be better than Ja Morant.
"This is actually a speciality of mine. I have my own podcast, the basketball wizard, and a blog by the same name.   My hot takes this year include Darius Garland for most improved player, and Ben Simmons to the Twolves in a 3 team trade with the Cavs. I also see the Jazz winning the west, again."

"Last year he averaged all of 6 passes per game less than Darius Garland, who not a single soul would say is a ball hog.  I think Cavs fans just don't like that we roll out 2 small guards as a starting backcourt and see Garland as a ""true PG"" while Sexton is a tweener. Feels like ever since Garland was drafted Sexton was destined to be a 6th man in a lot of fans eyes, a la Lou Williams. But all he has done since Garland was drafted is improve his scoring and efficiency every season and improved his playmaking for teammates."
"I think the BIGGEST problem here is Morey.   I'm sure they've gotten any number of offers that would make the Sixers better.   They would have likely beat the Hawks with ANY other starting point guard in the league (and likely some back-up point guards too).   FVV for Simmons. TAKE IT.   De'Aaron Fox for Simmons? TAKE IT.  Darius Garland or Collin Sexton for Simmons? TAKE IT.   They are ALL an improvement on Simmons. HE IS THAT BAD.  People will say ""But his defense.""  HE IS ONLY GOOD ON DEFENSE BECAUSE HE IS SO GOD DAMNED TALL for his position. If he were the same height as every guy he defended, he'd be above average.   I've seen that guy get embarrassed on defense almost every time I've seen him play. He's Gary Payton reincarnated or something. He's just a dude who has a lot of length compared to other point guards. Have him guard a guy his own size in the post and he's FUCKED.   &amp;#x200B;  But Morey thinks he's going to be able to get assets for him at a time when the rest of the league now knows how FUCKING TRASH this guy is."
"It’s a high number but I’d like the cavs to win 30 games.  I don’t mind if Evan Mobley develops slow.  His job in the nba is not easy.  I’d love to see something resembling good 3 and D play from Okoro, and that would really validate our organization’s path forward.  A minor improvement in Collin Sexton’s scoring is fine.  A minor improvement for Darius Garland is fine.  They’re both very good now."
Aaron Gordon or Darius Garland
"Did you read what I wrote? he's going up against Zion, Ja Morant, RJ Barret and Darius Garland, it's not like there's a clear choice here. I said maybe Hunter, and my only reasoning was if his injury causes him to fall in the rotation. This isn't some big slight against Hunter.  All have shown potential and greatness, some more than others (Zion/Ja), Hunter averaged 18 ppg for 17 games to start the season. It's a very small sample size. Compared to the other 4 who have put up as good of numbers for a whole season or more. Additionally he tore his meniscus, it's not a light injury by any means. This isn't a slight at Hunter, but rather just answering OP's question of making a random prediction. Like I said I like his game, and don't expect him to be a bust, but rather the other four appear to have a higher floor thus far in their careers due to health and consistency."
Mvp Darius Garland  MIP Kevin Love   Dpoy Jarrett Allen   6moty Ricky Rubio   Roty Evan Mobley
"1.) Anthony Edwards - better team around him, all the tools, better coach  2.) Darius Garland - super slept on and Miami may have a better record but another year of Garland developing and he’s gonna put his name out there   3.) this is tough because I don’t see OKC doing much this season and would tank towards the end, I’m leaning Ingram because of the expected improvements   4.) Mo bamba just cause   5.) Mikal we’ve seen what he can do and I’m expecting improvements from him   6.) MPJ, he’s going to thrive as the second option without Murray there I hope JJJ has a great season and I was originally really high on him but idk anymore"
"Darius Garland.  Big talk from everyone on the team about him taking a step forward in leadership and showing out during training camp. But the preseason games still show him hesitant to take shots and take over.  Year 3 will be telling on how the Cavs move forward.  Also, Colin Sexton."
Darius garland &gt; Ja
Darius Garland gonna average 22/8 this year and sexton is gonna average 26 just wait cleveland is gonna open some eyes lol
"I think Darius Garland is gonna go from a promising young PG to all-star level  Jaden McDaniels will be really good too, he'll end up being like a early days Paul George-lite type of player"
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."

"This year will be the defining year to evaluate that trade I think. I expect this year we'll see a larger role for NAW and Hayes, and according to Pels insiders Hayes has really developed his 3PT shot. If he has a legit 3, and if NAW lives up the promise he showed when given a starting spot briefly last year, the Pels probably came out winners.  I think Hunter is becoming a little overrated. I'm not saying anything about his future, but I think people are too sold on what he'll be too soon. He only played 23 games last year, and it seems he's had two operations on that right meniscus(someone fact check that)? This year will be big for him too to see if he can stay healthy and evaluate just how good on offense he really is. I also don't love his fit with BI and Zion as I don't think any of the three are suited to play SG from the Hawks perspective.  With pick 4, I had the Pelicans taking Darius Garland. I think he's the player we need to evaluate against. His ball handling, half court playmaking, and floor spacing is exactly what the Pelicans need and he would fit really well offensively. He'd have also had a year under the tutelage of Jrue."
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"Dude it’s the opposite. Being on the lakers is what makes them overrated. Kuzma has been talked about more than say Darius Garland the last couple of years even though Garland has star potential. People pretend Kuzma vs Tatum was an argument.   With Kuzma specifically once the Lakers got AD, he became so hyper criticized and got so much shit, everyone now acts like he’s garbage. He received too much attention in both directions because of the Lakers.  The exact same thing will likely happen with Talen Horton Tucker. He is currently in the super overrated stage. Here’s a Twitter account with a million followers saying “hot take that isn’t that hot THT will be a superstar one day.” He also is put in the top 10 in bleacher report’s 2019 re-draft ahead of guys who have shown way more like PJ Washington, Cameron Johnson, and Keldon Johnson.  [tht superstar lol ](https://twitter.com/overtime/status/1440349497096224776?s=21)  [2019 redraft](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2948039-2019-nba-re-draft-who-follows-zion-williamson.amp.html)  For fuck’s sake the guy averaged 9 points on bad efficiency. and I’m sure 2-3 years from now when Talen Horton Tucker is a decent back-up guard after being blamed for why the Lakers failed, he will become underrated."
Jordan Poole wins MIP.  Curry leads the Warriors to a top 4 seed and wins MVP.  Paul George averages 25+ and leads the Clippers to the playoffs.  Miami finishes as a top 2 seed.  Darius Garland averages 22 pts and 7 assists.  The Pelicans make the play in and compete for a playoff spot.  Tatum averages 27+ and makes all NBA 2nd team.
Get your Darius Garland stock now
Kevin Porter Jr   Darius Garland  Keldon Johnson
Darius Garland
"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
"I'd have to disagree just based on the strength of the Eastern Conference now. I don't think even another leap for Collin Sexton and a mini leap from Darius Garland would be enough to make the play-in. It's no disrespect to them, it's respect to the other Eastern teams and the overall talent of the league top-to-bottom. Almost everyone has promising young players or bonafide stars. The Cavs aren't alone in that, and I tried to account for that as well when projecting them this year."
"Disagree, show me the great package for Simmons where the Cavs are saying no to Darius Garland straight up."
"It's not subtle.  &gt; “Darius Garland actually,” [Draymond] Green said on “Warriors Roundtable” on 95.7 The Game when asked about the toughest players to guard. “And I know that’s probably an unpopular opinion. That kid is so fast, so herky-jerky and he can shoot the ball. When he really figures out how good he truly is. &gt;  &gt; “I hate getting switched onto him. It’s rough getting switched onto Darius Garland.”"
Darius Garland can have 2nd place.
2016: Taurean Prince ---&gt; Papagiannis                        De'Andre Bembry --&gt; Malachi Richardson  2017: John Collins --&gt; Harry Giles  2018: Trae Young --&gt; Mo Bamba                        Kevin Huerter --&gt; Josh Okogie   2019: De'Andre Hunter --&gt; Darius Garland             Cam Reddish --&gt; Cam Johnson  2020: Onyeka Okongwu --&gt; Killian Hayes   Uhh can we just have our picks lol
"Cavs:  *2016: Kay Felder - Marcus Paige  We didn’t select Felder, but the Hawks traded him to us on draft night.  2017: No draft selections  2018: Collin Sexton - Kevin Knox  2019: Darius Garland - Jarrett Culver   2020: Isaac Okoro - Onyeka Okongwu  Yeah I’ll stick with what we drafted."
"It really all depends on if any of their young players are any good. Personally I don't think that any of the guys they have outside of Mobley is a franchise player, and Mobley I haven't seen enough of to make a fair judgement yet.  They have a few decent young players, but is anybody realistically frightened of a team who's best player is Jared Allen? Or Lauri Markkanen? Or Darius Garland?  But at least they haven't traded all of their future flexibility away in order to assemble this mediocre roster. All it takes is some luck and for one of these young guys to pop and they have the assets to flip some picks and reassemble the team.  They're probably still a few years away from making any noise, but they aren't totally hopeless, and at least Cavs fans have a title to enjoy this millenium. As a Bulls fan my memories of glory are long since faded."
Darius Garland is 6’10 now for anyone wondering.
Darius Garland has grown to 6’5”  Simply ridiculous  He’s at least 6’7” now
Darius Garland&gt;Ja Morant
"So… Darius garland, Kevin love and a pick?"
"Am I crazy for thinking that Darius Garland was almost as good as Ja last year, and will surpass him this year?"
Darius Garland
Darius Garland
That’s a lie . To sit up here and continue this narestuve that sexton doesn’t pass or make guys better is beyond ridiculous!!! And the fact you guys always wanna use the role Darius plays as a way to say he’s better when this kid has never taken over a game or can get to the basket is crazy. Garland has been missing in action all season but his one good month in April y’all start growing him the best while sexton consistenly carries this team and can go toe to toe with the best .Y’all trying so hard to paint him as perfect because it’s popular to hate sexton right now
DARIUS GARLAND IS GONNA B A STAR DON’T TRADE HIM
"There’s no need to be aggressive. You shouldn’t attempt to discuss basketball if you’re going to get defensive over someone disagreeing with you.  Yes I understand that Steph and Klay play a huge part in Draymond’s playmaking. But following that same logic, considering the Cavs wouldn’t have anyone near Steph or Klay in that regard (and no, Garland won’t be close), then that would mitigate how impactful Simmons can be as a half court playmaker.  &gt;On Philly you have Joel camped in the paint the majority of the game and multiple bodies down low to limit his game…  I fail to see how a lineup consisting of Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen offers *more* spacing than a lineup consisting of Seth Curry and Joel Embiid. Curry is a much better shooter than Garland, and Embiid at least shoots the three a little where Allen doesn’t at all. In fact, a starting lineup with Simmons, Allen and Mobley might just be the worst spacing lineup in the league. There offence would almost certainly be last in the league."
No bias Darius Garland… disregard flair
I think a Pelican regret should be not keeping fourth pick and grabbing Darius Garland.  Seems like he'd be a cool fit with Zion/BI.
Jordan poole and darius garland come off the top
"My personal picks:  3-POINT SHOOTOUT: Jonas Valanciunas, Stephen Curry, Seth Curry, Lonzo Ball, Carmelo Anthony, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Darius Garland, Christian Wood  DUNK CONTEST: Daniel Gafford, Anfernee Simons, Anthony Edwards, Javonte Green  SKILLS CHALLENGE: Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Kuzma, Evan Mobley, Tyler Herro, Kevin Porter Jr."
"nah, it’s Koby Altman  every single year we draft the dude who is known to work harder than others   multiple times the cavs said they want to build a culture first, team second   after LeBron left, Gilbert and Koby made the decision to focus on getting guys who worked hard as hell. Sexton was the first piece, but you can’t ignore that he’s the only other Cavalier that’s ever been reported as being difficult to play with.   i think if you look at the quotes of Darius Garland, he feels like more of a leader  not even mentioning this team had vets like Tristan Thompson, Delly, and now Rubio on it. Sexton really ain’t that kind of leader, Okoro is just as hard of a worker"

"This is one of the worst defensive sequences I've seen in a long time. After the steal, there are three Mavs who get inside the three point line for one Cavalier on the Cavs' side of the floor. The Cavs get lucky that Luka's pass to Hardaway is just a touch short so he can't drive or pull up in time. Instead, though, Porzingis, who got back on offense *last* is wide open on the outside because Mobley (#4) is standing in the middle of the key guarding absolutely no one. Hardaway makes an easy pass all the way across the floor to Porzingis as Finney-Smith *also* gets wide open on the baseline. Porzingis makes a half-decent pump fake, which Mobley does not attempt to block, but bites on by essentially running past Porzingis completely. As this is happening, Lauri Markkenen begins sliding over to guard Finney-Smith, but loses all awareness of the ball, so he doesn't see Porzingis is driving into the lane until the second (and last) dribble. As Porzingis picks up his dribble, Hardaway is open again for the outlet because Okoro (#35) is pretending to offer help defense with his shoulders perpendicular to the basket. Allen's contest of the dunk is actually the *best* attempt at defense in this sequence, purely because he didn't foul.  And can we talk about what the fuck Darius Garland was doing with that hard step thing to stop the ball when Luka was bringing it down the floor? He put himself on his own heels. Complete luck that Luka had already picked up the dribble and started looking for the pass.  Anyways, nice win by the Cavs tonight, I suppose. Hope KP's ankle isn't too serious."
Darius Garland is really fucking good.  Ashamed to say this is my first Cavs game of the year
"depends on where you think his best position   so many people just want to stick him in the post and ask him to guard people like al horford   i don’t. i want him to be a perimeter player. his passing is so good that i would pine for him to be our main playmaker if we didn’t have darius garland   we have Allen to bang down low with people. if they want to go big to defend Mobley, then the Cavs will run a Mobley/DG PnR (yes, DG will be the screener) and the cavs will get the switch, as they have down time and time again   go watch mobley from last night, he’s hitting pull ups and taking dudes off the bounce with regularity (truly looked like the only thing he was told was “score the fuckin ball”)  Mobley himself has said he wants to be a perimeter player. i agree he needs to get stronger and put on muscle, but not because it’s going to make him able to “bang in the post” it’s because he will get quicker, he will be able to jump higher, and he will be able to absorb more contact when he drives   mobley needs to be off-ball and weak side as much as possible to maximize his defensive impact. he’s so good at getting switched onto smaller guys and also helping from the weak side. if allen and mobley force you to play 2 guys who don’t have 3 point range, the paint is instantly shut off and the guards can now gamble all night   Mobley needs to bulk up as much as Bill Russell did"

"I wanna see Darius in the actual game but I think he needs another year. Trae, Lavine, Beal, DeRozan, Brown, Harden just because... I think Garland is on the cusp."
r/nba has been taken over by Darius Garland and I'm all for it.
"Just came out of Thai prison, is Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland a better duo than Shaq and Kobe?"
"They always struggle with efficiency. Dug this up from when I looked into this in the past about some guards. This was through their first 27 games, so a bigger sample of bad play and  more time for the guys I'm about to list to actually turn the corner so unfair to the current crop:  Trae Young: 16/3/7 with 4tos on atrocious 38/25/78 splits   DLo: 12/4/4 with 1.5 A:TO on 40/31/71 splits   Lonzo Ball: 9/7/7 on 33/27/49 splits   De'Aaron Fox: 10/3/4 on 41/30/68 splits   Jamal Murray: 10/3/2 on 38/36/83 splits  Throwing in some more guys now through 20 games(\~what today's rookies have played so far):  Darius Garland: 11/2/3 on 48%TS  Ant: 14/3/2 on 47%TS  One-and-Done guards are going to play horribly out the gate. We go through this cycle of being shocked every year. Stop being shocked. The guys who came out the gate notably well in the past like Luka and Ja are not only the exceptions, but also come from a different background one having played pros and other being a sophomore."
Probably Cleveland. Darius Garland is the real deal and Mobely is looking like he'll be really good.  After that probably the Pels just because Zion is so fun to watch. Dude is an absolute wrecking ball.
"Disagree, it can be both. Jae got fouled, and he flopped. Just like how Darius Garland flings his limbs in every direction from touch fouls lol — he’s a flopper but he did get fouled."
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
Darius Garland and Collin Sexton: “Are we jokes to you?”
"As a warriors fan yeah there’s no way Poole is better than garland LMAO. Probably never will be, Darius seems to have that “it” factor. Good playmaker and efficient shooter"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."

"Sit down and ask yourself honestly, are the Cavs contenders with a team of Jarrett Allen, Kevin Love, Lauri Markkanen, Darius Garland, Ricky Rubio, and Evan Mobley?  Just think about it please.  In no universe are they contenders, just like how the Hawks weren't contenders in 2015."
"Darius Garland is an all star player and i hope everyone tunes in to watch him make the leap. He’s been top 15 in assists pretty consistently for the last 18 months, but now his scoring is really about to go to the next level. Guy is always threatening 50/40/90 and with Sexton out, his light is greener than ever. 24/11 last night and I truly think that will be close to the norm for him. He’s the new Steve Nash  Hope the head injury doesn’t keep him out too long, because DG/Allen/Mobley is a legit championship core and the Cavs have to build around and maximize that trio"

Darius Garland getting elbowed in the head completely changed the game. Went 1-12 the rest of the way and never looked the same.
Is Cleveland making a statement right now? Darius garland battling KD
Darius Garland has the coolest hair in the NBA that's for sure
Darius Garland took an elbow to the jaw
Darius Garland is SO FUCKING GOOD man
"First Half Takes:  - In conclusion, Cavs are back. This team is actually pretty good, doesn't look like the big boyes are a gimmick. We just need our sweet prince back and we'll be in solid running for at least a playin spot.  - Dean Wade somehow decided to become prime MJ this half on defense and I'm all for it  - Jarrett Allen is a star.  - Has anyone ever seen Darius Garland and God in the same room?"
I love Darius Garland. That is all
Darius Garland is our franchise along with Mobley to be honest
Darius Garland has the prettiest arc in the league and it's not even close.
"Darius Garland leads Cavs in points, assists, and steals."
"He definitely becomes a lottery pick.  Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, Tyler Herro, Darius Garland, Cam Reddish, RJ Barrett are varying degrees of definitely to likely going ahead of him, but he gets bumped up past quite a few other players for sure."
"Darius Garland, Harrison Barnes"
Jordan Poole or Darius Garland
Darius Garland
Darius Garland
Darius Garland. Dude is an assassin and will turn some heads now that Sexton is out. Might be a top 5 PG by season's end
Darius Garland feels like he has all the skills for it. Idk about super star but he's awesome to watch.
I think these guys have all star potential:  Darius Garland  Patrick Williams  Wendell Carter Jr  Killian Hayes
Darius Garland.
"Garland has looked better than I expected this year for sure, but still not amazing. I don't think Sexton *is* capable of being a volume scorer Beal/Dame type, but I think he *could* be. Garland just seems like an average to solid starter, but I can't imagine him ever taking on a real star role from what I've watched.  I also really thought his volume had increased this season from last, but it hasn't, he's just taking a lot more 3s.  I think Fox was certainly overhyped by some, but despite an inefficient start to this year, I still think he has star potential - I just think Kangz probably holds him back a little.  I definitely wouldn't say Garland looks like the better prospect of the two though, and am curious what makes you say that.

Fox's age 22 season led Garland's (thus far) in every imaginable category except for shooting efficiency and on notably higher USG%.   Fox is also 2 inches taller than Garland, and [topped out](https://www.passionweiss.com/2021/02/11/never-bored-again-deaaron-fox-the-dead/) at about 17 MPH running on court per ESPN. While I can't find comparable stats for Garland, I haven't seen his off-ball movement be quite as impressive as Fox's was at the same age, he was just so explosive. I'll cede that Fox has seemed to either slow down or hesitate more since his run of abdominal issues last year, but again, I blame the Kings' use of him more than his own skills for most of his dropoff.  I don't think Garland is a lost project by any means, and I assume I'll see him in the league as a 4th/5th/6th option for some years to come, but I don't see any star potential there from what I've seen, and I've never really understood why Cleveland fans are so sure they see some spark I don't."
"Not rlly, I mean Darius garland suffered from a torn meniscus like his second game of college ball and his draft stock actually improved 🤷🏽‍♂️"
"Darius Garland all star, calling it"
"If you've watched the past few games, their only healthy starter is Darius Garland"
"Yes, a regular season game in which he torched the 9-8 Cavs led by the immortals Dean Wade, Darius Garland and co. is proof that he is better than Magic freaking Johnson.  Steph is amazing, revolutionized the game and is top 15 all-time, he is not in Magic Johnson's level. Magic never blew a 3-1 lead nor had more turnovers than assists in an NBA Finals, Magic also never missed the freaking playoffs in his prime.  Downvote me to hell, but Jesus, recency bias is a hell of a drug."
"booker definitely needs to be all-nba, I think hes a top 15 player nowadays  darius garland has also been excellent but Im not sure if hes quite at that level"
Darius Garland inside three feet: 72.7% Fox: 59.6%  Garland assists per 36 minutes: 6.8 Fox: 6.2  Soooo I'm not sure you actually watch Garland..
Darius Garland will be the greatest Cav in franchise history

People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"CP3 is obvious answer as per other comments. Less popular of an answer would be Darius Garland, imo. Dude is 100% sauce."
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
Darius Garland is the smoothest fucking point guard I’ve seen in a long time.
"Cole Anthony, Jalen Brunson, Seth Curry, Larry Nance Jr, Claxton, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland are all 2nd generation."
"Yup, his stats that last year in OKC are roughly comparable to what Darius Garland is doing this year. It was definitely more of a ""exciting young player"" case than a ""future hall of famer"". People seem to forget he started all of 7 games for OKC, playoffs included. He was an important piece, but he wasn't THE piece by any stretch."
&gt; 6'1 Darius Garland  Didnt you hear? DG is 7 feet now
"Jayson Tatum couldn't post up 6'1 Darius Garland yesterday man, I feel your pain"
"Darius Garland is flirting with 50/40/90 and is top 10 in assists, would hate for Mobley to have to go to All-star weekend all alone"
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12.

Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
"Let's see..Evan Mobley is the real deal, Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley as a back court means that literally 75% of the League don't even have the bigs to guard both of them. Ricky Rubio and Darius Garland mean that they have a consistent floor general almost every minute of the game, Stevens is an underrated defender and they have serious depth too. Cedi, Okoro, Markkanen, Kevin Love, oh and Colin Sexton who's not even healthy.   I'd view this team as a first round exit but a legit playoff team via the play-in tournament. Maybe they play in the tourney and get knocked out or maybe they make the first round, that's probably their ceiling right now but in 2-3 years once the right roster gets built up and Evan Mobley really gets into his bag, it's going to be disgusting."
Okay but also Darius Garland is good

"I would have to say either the warriors or the cavs. Since I'm a cavs fan, I'll be biased and tip my hat towards the cavs. Here are my reasons;   1) Evan Mobley has come out of this draft playing at least a year ahead of where I could have believed he would be. He has yet to come into his full potential, but I didn't think he would have been as much of an impact as he has.  2) Darius Garland has improved in all aspects of his game; and seems a lot more confident on the court.   3) Jarret Allen has been a pleasure to watch. I feel like a good center that can play defense is hard to find, and the cavs found him.  4) Ricky Rubio has been playing with a vigor that I've never seen before. His veteran presence has had a huge impact on the team. He's been present for so many clutch plays.   5) Their defense is on a whole new level, and they have been playing so well considering the misfortune they have had with injuries so far. Last year, this team looked lethargic and unmotivated. This year's team is the complete opposite."
I like what I see from Garland. The rookie gets a lot of the headlines but Darius has been consistent so far. And he is the type of player I would circle as having a second half breakout where he may start delivering 30 point or 15 assists type of games. I remember Steph said he was gonna be legit
"Darius Garland is really having a break out season.  He's pretty young but he should be in the mix for MIP, I think."
You showed me a clip of kuzma guarding Darius garland to prove your point? Laughable. Think I’ve only watched one wizards game this year and he damn near got dropped that game.
"we're going to learn a lot about this team's future with Darius Garland running the offense full time and Okoro as a 2. We really need Lauri and Love back with Sexton gone.  even if this backcourt balls, i still see us matching any offer on sexton since we'll want a pure bucket on the team."
"Yeah it's very inconsistent right now. I like the general direction of the rules changes but it's virtually impossible to say whether something is a foul or not right now, there's no clear threshold and I imagine it's frustrating as a player who draws a lot of contact both inside and outside the bounds of the new rules.   The Blazers recently suffered a very consequential no call when Darius Garland literally attempted a take foul to stop Anfernee Simons on a fast break bucket in a close game in Cleveland with a minute left. Last 2 minute repot confirms, and like, Garland literally wrapped him up on thee break. It was a no call that resulted in a turn over, Blazers ended up losing narrowly. At times the refs just seem hesitant to blow the whistle on obvious fouls and that's not good.   Obviously bad calls happen every year, but these types of no calls are a new variable and I don't think would normally happen. The foul baiting is one thing but that's not all that's changed, they're calling fewer fouls everywhere and there needs to be a much clearer line in the sand than just ""blow the whistle less"" which is what it seems to me rn."
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."
When I saw Zion up close in CLE his rookie year it was clear that his weight/gait/body mechanics were going to be a serious problem. There’s way too much force going through his legs with every step. He’s not graceful.   I predicted that night that Darius Garland would have a better career and I stand by that two years later.
"&gt;these guys were the top [rookie] guards  you kinda answered your own question. Darius Garland was one of the worst players in the league his rookie year and now he’s breaking out. Guards take time, especially young guys without pro experience (unlike Duarte—who is 24–and Giddey—who played professionally in Australia). You can’t judge any player after 10 games, let alone ball-dominant guards."
Kemba had no rookie camp because of the lockout tbf  There are definitely other examples though. Darius Garland was an absolutely terrible rookie and he's already a good point guard at 21
"Sexton was a 22 year old player that score 25 ppg on good efficiency last year. Rubio is 31 years old and has never averaged more than 13.1 ppg for a season in his entire career. Let's just ignore for a moment that Rubio is A BACKUP PG and Sexton is a STARTING SG, and that they play completely different positions and Rubio is stuck behind Darius Garland, NOT sexton. Rubio is a bad shooter, career 33% 3P shooter, and we are a bad shooting  team (bottom 5 in the league) that desperately needs spacing from their back court. Rubio is also a below average efficiency offensive player, career 51.5% TS.  Rubio is a defensive, playmaking PG that can't shoot on a team that has a defensive center who can't shoot, a defensive PF that can't shoot, and when healthy, a defensive SF/SG that can't shoot. You want to get rid of the #1 scorer on the team - who can shoot - and replace him with... Okoro? A defensive SF/SG who can't shoot or score? So rubio can what, pass to a bunch of brick layers? This shit is fucking stupid. You have NO FUCKING IDEA what you're talking about on any level."
"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Evan Mobley and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Ricky Rubio gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Darius Garland yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Mobley hit the locker room door, former NBA great LeBron James hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
The closest - 2020 Cavs:  * Kevin Love son of Stan Love * Larry Nance Jr son of Larry Nance * Darius Garland son of Winston Garland * Dante Exum son of Cecil Exum (drafted in the 9th round by the Nuggets) * Coach J. B. Bickerstaff son of Bernie Bickerstaff
"Obviously Davis is the better player and the Lakers won a championship so no regrets in their part. But what would that team look like if they had just kept everyone and let them grow?  Ball at the one. Evolved his shot. Could take play making responsibilities when LeBron needs a breather. Randle a good 4 or small ball 5. Play Ingram at the 2. LeBron at the 3. Take any of DAndre Hunter, Darius Garland, or Jarrett Culver to round it out.   They probably don't win the championship in the bubble. But they might win it this year. Still have Curaso and Hart for depth. Fun thought exercise if not irrelevant."

"Evan Mobley, Jarret Allen, Darius Garland, Collin Sexton, Dylan Windler, Issac Okoro, and Cedi Osman (For now)."
"I saw someone calling Evan Mobley ""Evan Garnett"" the other day and that really tickled me.  When Matthew Dellavedova was here, Outback Jesus was a pretty good name.  Of course there's Sexland for Collin Sexton and Darius Garland.  There's been the name floating around for our trio of 7-footers (Jarrett Allen, Evan Mobley, Lauri Markkanen) of ""Tower City"" because there's an area in Cleveland called the Tower City Center. Though personally, as a Kent State alum, I'm hoping to get the name ""Tri-Towers"" going because those were the dorms I lived in."
Darius garland and Jarrett Allen for Brown
"ayy I’d put him below Ja and Zion, and above RJ Barrett and Darius Garland  Keldon Johnson 6"
&gt; Imagine how much better the Pels look with Deandre Hunter  Or Darius Garland.
He’s washed and doesn’t care because there are no good players. He went from Lebron and Kyrie to  Darius garland. I wish he got traded to the Dubs.
"He got dumped to Memphis.  The Wolves did that trade before they swapped Wiggins for DLO and they were trading up to try to get Darius Garland. A lot of people were surprised the Cavs drafted Garland considering his fit with Sexton. So the Wolves were forced to take BPA, which was Culver.  Culver's flamed out for a lot of reasons, but leading up to that draft there were a lot of conversations on who would be the better player - Culver or DeAndre Hunter."
"Didn't see this mentioned yet, but:  &gt; I think Collin Sexton is a backup and an a--hole. None of his teammates like him. I like Darius Garland. I actually like Garland. I think he plays hard. He puts pressure on you because he can shoot, he can pass, and he's a much more willing passer. He's not out there trying to f------ get his stats and go home in the same way that Sexton is. I don't think they can play those two small guards together and get a ton out of them.  &gt; https://www.si.com/nba/2021/10/15/nba-preview-anonymous-scout-takes-lakers-nets-warriors-bucks"
