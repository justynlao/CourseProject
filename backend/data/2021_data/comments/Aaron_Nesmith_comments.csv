"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
"If got offered like Aaron Nesmith and some second rounders, would u do it?"
hes exactly who i want aaron nesmith to be.  they are mirror-images in terms of physicals and playstyle except nesmith is way worse at everything.  but it gives me some hope.
Lmao  Does Brad Stevens hate Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith
**Payton Pritchard** (26th pick) has been awesome. Absolute 3pt sniper as promised (42% on 3 attempts per game) and is surprisingly good on defense. Has already earned himself big minutes on this roster.    **Aaron Nesmith** (14th pick) on the other hand has been uh...pretty bad. He's a turnstile on defense and is bricking everything. He was drafted to be a 3pt sniper but is currently 3/16 from 3 in his career and is not part of the rotation. He was a healthy DNP in tonights game vs Philly.    Overall i'm pretty whelmed. Wish we used the 14th pick on someone else. I was screaming for Maxey or Bey pre draft and they've both thoroughly outplayed Nesmith so far.
"Payton Pritchard: Awesome! He’s very aggressive on offense and a great playmaker for our bench, which we’ve really been lacking the last few seasons. He shows a lot of intensity on the court  Aaron Nesmith: Definitely has been struggling. It’s much too early to give up on him yet obviously. His shot just hasn’t been falling, but he has a really nice stroke and I think he’ll get used to the NBA eventually. He seems like a really smart guy and I’m wondering if he’s overthinking things a bit on the court"
Can't wait to see him get Aaron Gordon for Nesmith and a first rounder.
"You're core of Murray, Kat and Wiggins - because you won't trade him for dlo if ypu already have that lead guard makes you the magic of the west. Congrats on getting destroyed in the first round and not having Edwards but Aaron Nesmith or so."
"I don't think that anyone really thought Malachi Flynn was going to look this bad with the Raptors, even early on in the season.   His struggles have been a real surprise, kind of like Aaron Nesmith not being able to buy a 3 pointer."
Celtics will give you Aaron nesmith and a second or two if we’re feeling generous
Funny that the Sixers got Isiah Joe at pick 49 and he's better than Aaron Nesmith and Pritchard combined.
"The last four first-rounders you guys selected with those ""valuable"" draft picks are Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith and Payton Pritchard. Come on, dude."
"Well I'm not even sure the Celtics would have drafted him. Based on Ainge's drafting of Aaron Nesmith, he'd probably have taken Kevin Knox."
"so much this.  OP has the Celtics using a protection slot on Tristan Thompson over Aaron Nesmith or Romeo Langford, 2 late lottery/mid-first picks from the last 2 years.  There is no chance in hell the Celtics would protect Thompson, who is about to be 30 and on a MLE contract over 2 21 year-olds on rookie scale deals."
"there is absolutely zero chance the Celtics would protect Tristan Thompson over Aaron Nesmith or Romeo Langford.  TT is about to be 30 and is on the MLE, Nesmith/Langford are 21 and on rookie scale deals for multiple seasons."
So they’ll probably be starting Jeff Teague Payton Prichard  Aaron nesmith  Marcus smart Daniel theis
"[Marcus Smart, Jeff Teague, Payton Pritchard, Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, Aaron Nesmith, Daniel Theis and Tacko Fall](https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/1348353329529761793)"
Even then our only wing is Aaron Nesmith
"Well you can look at the Celtics, if Brown, Ojeleye and Green are out due to safety protocols related to Tatum's positive case.   They'd be looking at Carsen Edwards, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Jeff Teague, Marcus Smart, Tremont Waters, Daniel Theis and Tacko Fall.  That's 6 guards 6'4 and under (4 under 6'1), Theis and Fall.  0-7 waiting to happen in the next two weeks if they're forced to play and Brown, Ojeleye and Green are held out."
"Apparently Vanderbilt runs some sort of weird-ass defensive scheme that's not translateable at all to the NBA, so Nesmith has been tasked with re-learning how to play defense from the ground up, which is not easy given the shorter-than-usual offseason.  He certainly does look incredibly lost on that end whenever he plays.  Stevens will not play rookies if they can't defend, so he'll be stuck on the bench until he can work within the system.  Once Romeo returns from his wrist surgery, he'll probably leapfrog Nesmith as well.  I'm fully expecting this to be a redshirt season for Aaron at this point with anything he can contribute being a big plus."
"In other words, Semi gave all of his challenges to Aaron Nesmith."
"Daniel theis, Aaron nesmith, carsen edwards"

I'll take Aaron Nesmith
Great picks for certain. But there are also these guys named Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith. At some point he needs to do a better job putting talent around the J Team.
Yeah I'm sure the thing that has helped Payton over Aaron is the fact that Payton was a 4 year player in college compared with Nesmith who was only in college for 2. I'm sure Aaron will turn up soon
Celtics  1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Peyton Pritchard 5. Robert Williams 6. Aaron Nesmith 7. Romeo Langford
"His stats were artificial though. He got them mostly when Nurse put him out against the Celtics bench. It was like Payton Pritchard, Tremont Waters, Aaron Nesmith, Grant Williams, and Rob Williams against the Raptors starting unit. I think his first half stats are more relevant to his play."
More like Aaron Nesmith. Carsen didn't play
TIL Aaron Nesmith is a player
"Saddiq Bey went 7/11 from deep against us over the weekend, while Aaron Nesmith was a DNP-CD. Not great so far!"
when we're done with that we'll just go ahead &amp; trade Aaron Nesmith for Luka
"Trade for Harden probably.   But they need to use that TPE and get some nice complimentary pieces; a lot of players from the Magic could work (i.e. Gordon, Fournier, Ross) or even Harrison Barnes.   The bench is too raw but they need at least one of those guys between Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith or Romeo Langford to break out. None are great shooters at the moment.  They'll probably continue to be a perennial second round exit though until Tatum/Brown become the next Jordan/Pippen."
"They have mismatched personnel.  Theis, Williams, and TT can really only play C.  They need to move one of them  Prichard has started off strong.  If Kemba comes back and can play 25-30 minutes then I don’t see how they play all of Teague, Kemba and Pritchard either.    They either need a stretch 4 to push Jaylen to a 2 or they need a 2 who can murder from downtown.   Langford and Nesmith are complete unknowns but both could quickly solve two of Boston’s biggest problems: bench scoring and floor spacing for Tatum/Brown   I would have assumed Boston would be showcasing Nesmith for a trade, but he must be real bad in practice if he’s not getting any play.   The most obvious trade is for Aaron Gordon.  If they could get Gordon and Fournier (no idea if that’s even possible with cap/TPE.  I think they would have to do two separate trades to make it work"
"The Celtics sub has preferred Barnes for months. I’m personally comfortable giving up 2 FRPs, one of Langford/Nesmith, and Grant Williams, but idk if the Kings do that. Also I really love Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith"
You're wrong.  The Celtics *only* have shit to offer them.  Like Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith!
But Aaron Nesmith is a great trade piece! (ignoring that he's essentially out of their rotation)
Harrison Barnes to the Celtics for Aaron Nesmith + a late 1st
"Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, and a future 1st"
"I think a better example would be a stock. If Aaron nesmith for example was doing really well, his value would go up making him a better trade asset but since he’s been pretty bad, the more teams realIze it the less value he has"
I think this is one of those cases where its just as much about the guys filling in as about who is missing. It doesnt seem like Marcus Smart should have this big of an impact but when his minutes are going to the likes of Aaron Nesmith and Tristan Thompson it makes a little more sense.
Cs really haven’t had any team will since Smarts been out... there were problems before he got hurt but they’re just magnified now. The guy playing with the most dog in him is Aaron Nesmith who couldnt buy a minute 4 weeks ago. Its a weird time a s a Cs fan
"exactly.  The Celtics sub are losing their minds right now since Aaron Nesmith isn't the second coming of Ray Allen after 20 games, he's in the same boat.  Everybody needs to chill TF out with rookies in general, but doubly so this year."
"&gt;miss used so many of their   I think people are looking to clown DA...but it’s not like he let his war chest evaporate w nothing to show for it.  * BOS 2014 1st, tanking year: Marcus Smart  * BKN 2014 1st: James Young  * BKN 2016 1st: Jaylen Brown  * BKN 2017 1st: Jayson Tatum  * BKN 2018 1st: traded for Kyrie Irving  * SAC 2019 1st: Romeo Langford  * MEM 2020 1st: Aaron Nesmith  Langford/Nesmith are incomplete. Jays + Marcus are hits. James Young (at #17) was an obvious whiff, and you could make an argument that the Cs would have been better off not trading for Kyrie."
"the Celtics are starting Theis and Tristan Thompson right now and their 6th man is Aaron Nesmith, Im fine with them having 2 all-stars"
Thank goodness circumstances have forced Brad Stevens to play Aaron Nesmith. Poor guy would be buried on the bench and permanently damaged developmentally if not.
"Romeo Langford is a great prospect. Sixers were patient with Embiid and it paid off, and I think Ainge will take that approach with Langford and his talent will eventually shine through.  Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith are good prospects.  Brown, Tatum, and Smart have great contracts. Only Tatum is getting the max and that was a no-brainer.  Celtics still own all of their own draft picks and have the biggest TPE in league history, a major asset.  This year isn't make-or-break for the Celtics necessarily. They may not be a true title contender with Hayward gone and Kemba in decline (although he might still have something in the tank), but they are still extremely well-positioned for the future. It's doubtful whether Ainge has any moves that could instantly vault them to contender status without also compromising the future. The most sensible move is probably to hold their cards and make use of the full TPE in the offseason, hopefully making a strong push for contention in 2022."
"Romeo looks like a bust, Grant Williams is a mediocre role player at best, Aaron Nesmith looks terrible right now but hopefully turns it around, passing on Myles Turner and McDermott was absolutely inexcusable."
In terms of value:  1. Payton Pritchard  2. Picks after 2024  3. Picks before 2024  4. Romeo Langford  5. Rob Williams  6. Aaron Nesmith  7. Basically the rest of the bench  8. Danny Ainge’s celebrity chipotle card   We ended up using most of the picks we had after the mass exodus from 2019-2020
"In the past four drafts, the Celtics have had 10 first round picks. Two were Jaylen and Jason, great picks in the top 5.  The remaining 8 picks turned into Yabu, Romeo Langford, Ante Zizic, Grant Williams, Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith. And some future picks.   You're saying they couldn't have done any better with EIGHT first round picks than that collection of bench players I listed above??"
"I don't know if I call Nader a hit, but otherwise I agree.  At least going by the wiz game grant Williams and Aaron Nesmith are not good basketball players."
"He did. And to be fair to ainge trading the consensus number 1 pick and drafting brown a few spots earlier than everybody thought he should go were both incredible moves that were scrutinized at the time. However, they were still both top 3 picks at the end of the day which gm's can ill-afford to miss on. He's also had a bit of success late in the draft throughout his gm tenure. Rondo, avery bradley, etwaun moore, terry rozier, abdel nader, robert willams, and payton pritchard. However recently he's had many, many chances to draft players in the middle of the first round and in the second round and so far has missed on a lot of them. Most are completly out of the league and although it's still very early in guys like grant williams, aaron nesmith, carsen edwards, tremont waters, and romeo langford's careers it's not looking great so far."
"&gt; has made Luwaru-Cabarot and the corpse of DeAndre Jordan valuable contributors on Day 1.  Lol... Go ask Nets fans about DJ. He's about as useful as he was last season, that is say, the entire Nets fanbase wants a new center.   Also, TLC's production hasn't really changed from last year besides a dip in efficiency.   &gt; Still, right after he left Houston after 2018 he dropped off in every facet just months after  Yeah.   He went from guarding Curry and Durant every second he was on the court to no longer being a plus defender.  That wasn't losing Harden, that was losing his athleticism.   &gt;He's waaay worse now after all that mileage and his value is low enough to where you coulda snagged him and made him a decent enough contributor on limited minutes  Except in your plan he's playing major minutes as a core rotation piece.  &gt;Harden woulda made all your promising youngins with all this untapped potential you Cs fans have been raving about into valuable role players.  No, because we're struggling with consistency from those guys on both ends.   Grant Williams, for example, has the potential to be a good player but he's a foul magnet and Harden doesn't fix that issue at all.    &gt; I've been dumbfounded by how much this sub (and the NBA fandom in general) undervalues Harden and other stars in trades.  No, it's more that you're overvaluing him.   He's an incredible MVP level player, but Harden + 1 guy doesn't win you a championship. You need to have a proper roster constructed around them.   * DeAndre Jordan is a defensive liability against key matchups - With or without Harden * Ariza slowed down too much to be a positive 3&amp;D player - With or without Harden * PJ Tucker's defence has declined with his age - With or without Harden * Grant Williams + Semi Ojeleye + Aaron Nesmith have **potential** but won't magically become consistent defenders overnight - With or without Harden * Romeo Langford has been a fantastic defender but he can't stay healthy - With or without Harden  Also, Harden isn't making guys elite on the defensive end. Which, without you realising, a lot of your argument seems to stem from.  You need to be elite on both ends to win a title. That Houston team you're referencing was the only Houston team that was a serious title contender and they were the only Houston team that was good defensively (6th in the league).  Harden doesn't win with the 15th rated defence (who would be even lower after the trade)."
"For sure that’s part of it. I just mean having Brown/Tatum/Hayward all being facilitating wings made it crowded. You’re seeing Brown take on more ball handling this year because it’s not split between him and Hayward. None of those 3 guys are effective as just spot up shooters, even if they’re capable of hitting the shots, which is basically the role Brown had last year. I remember recalling he needed the ball in his hands more but there were plenty of games where he just didn’t touch it in the 4th. I don’t blame the injury on coaching or the year after where Hayward was legitimately a liability on defense. Rushing him back for the Miami series last year was also just not him being 100%. They just never got a real shot at full strength with him and Kyrie.  I think the real problem, especially this year, is missing a key piece whether it’s Tatum, Smart or Kemba (them + Brown have been on the floor together for 21 minutes I think was the stat) is having that extra playmaker spaces the floor better. Right now their drives are getting stifled by collapsing defenses and their other guys aren’t getting open enough looks or just aren’t knocking them down because they don’t have that extra guy to account for so they can crowd the paint and guys like Semi Ojeleye or Grant Williams aren’t good enough without being wide open. Hayward also helped in this regard which is why he would be useful right now, because Boston’s half court offense looks totally inept. It’s the exact same problem they had against Miami’s zone and they really need the extra guy.  Yeah the coach needs to make adjustments to the personnel but when you don’t have the depth I think there’s only so much you can do because you’re not going to see guys like Aaron Nesmith or Javonte Green drive and distribute the same way that Tatum, Brown, Smart and Kemba can."
"Brad makes the most irritating rotations, starting lineups, and misuse of players in my eyes, because the Cs are the only team I follow.   These are the biggest gripes vs Brad:  1. Double big starters 2. Lack of challenge of call 3. Not calling timeouts quickly enough 4. Not playing Aaron Nesmith 5. Perceived lack of in-game adjustments"
"Theis, Thompson, and Teague are pretty popular suggestions around our sub. Realistically though the latter two wouldn't be worth shit in a trade though.  Theis is on a cheap expiring contract and people think we'll lose if we let that happen. Can't say I agree with that though. If he plays out his contract like he's started it we'll have gotten great value out of Theis. Hard to imagine a trade around him that isn't a wash. Theis brings a lot to both ends of the floor, especially if he can sustain his recent 3pt shooting. The one knock on Theis is he isn't big or physical enough to play with the Embiid and Goberts of the league, but we aren't realistically trading for someone who is.  In my opinion our best asset who will net the most return, and currently contributes least to any win now aspirations, is probably Robert Williams. Shown all the potential to be a starter, and he's a decent energy piece off the bench right now, but at this point is fairly underdeveloped when it comes to fundamentals. A lot of our fans see him as a core piece of our future, but if the right return is there Danny has to take it. They've shown a lot less but the same applies to Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith too."
"It's all relative, compared to where you were coming out of the 2018 playoffs your current team is a bottom quartile outcome.  Coming out of the 2018 playoffs you had just pushed LeBron to 7 games without Kyrie or Hayward and were supposed to have two more top 5 picks incoming from the Kings and Grizzlies. Fast forward 2 years and Kyrie, Hayward and Horford are gone, the picks turned into Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith and Kemba looks like one of the worst contracts in the NBA."
PP is good and I think Brad Stevens forgot Aaron Nesmith exists
"Yeah the celtics definitely would have had to trade brown or tatum to get a star, it's not like they have wasted 7 first round picks on Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Matisse Thybulle (traded), Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Desmond Bane (traded) in the past 3 years 😂😂😂. Definitely can't trade draft picks 😂😂"
Celtics took Aaron Nesmith over this guy ;_;
They literally have Aaron Nesmith no worries
"Doesn't make for a good segment on a talk show but they just haven't had enough good players healthy.  If you look at their totals half of their minutes are being played by dudes that I'm not sure belong in a rotation, forgetting about how crappy Smart and Kemba looked as they were first returning from injury.  For example Ojeyele, Grant Williams and Tremont Waters have played more minutes than Tatum.  TT and Pritchard have played more minutes than Jaylen Brown. Jeff Teague and Aaron Nesmith have played more than Kemba.    Looking at teams who are gonna hit the over on their win totals the Jazz have 10 players who have played 100 minutes, the Knicks have 12, the Hornets have 11 and the Celtics have 17.  Tough to establish an identity with bad players and no continuity."
"He's not a bust yet, he's like 19 and needs time to develop.  But was a really dumb pick by Sheppard ... you're building around 2 high usage all star level guards in Beal and Westbrook... why are you drafting a project player who's strength is supposed to play making ... and his weakeness is shooting..  Devin Vassell was available ... and if you could trade down you could have considered Aaron Nesmith (although he's struggling) or Sadiq Bey .."
"Me: Mom, can we get Saddiq Bey?  Mom: We have Saddiq Bey at home  *At Home: Aaron Nesmith*   This is just a joke btw, I’m very hopeful for Nesmith and like the pick still."
"Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith and our late 1st rounders you say?"
0. Luke Kornet  1. Tatum   2. Brown  3.Kemba  4. Smart  5. Robert Williams  6. Payton Pritchard  7. Tristan Thompson  8. Semi Ojeleye  9. Grant Williams  10. Aaron Nesmith  I didn’t include Fournier or Romeo because they haven’t played for us at all this year or Mo Wagner because he has played like 10 minutes.
"Tatum: MVP &amp; 1st &amp; 2nd Team All-NBAs,  perennial All-Star   Brown: Keeps making All-Star, makes at least 1 All-NBA team  Marcus Smart: Continues making 1st Team All-Defense  Rob Williams: DPOY   Romeo Langford: 6MOY  Kemba: Hovers around pre-injury Kemba  Aaron Nesmith: Klay Thompson lite  Payton Pritchard: Better TJ McConnell  2 Championships. Break the tie with the Lakers. Beat the Lakers in the Finals"
"Aaron ""RJ Hunter"" Nesmith"
What about Aaron Nesmith?
Aaron Nesmith when he gets minutes.
"&gt;Celtics trade for: Chris Boucher   &gt;   &gt;Raptors get: Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, 2 FRP in 2022 and 2024  What the fuck? 2 lottery picks + 2 FRP'S?  Boucher is great, but for that price tag? Hell no.  &gt;DEAL 2:   &gt;   &gt;Celtics trade for: Lonzo Ball and Wily Hernangomez   &gt;   &gt;Pelicans get: Marcus Smart and Payton Pritchard  Lonzo Ball has been shooting lights out, but he's not a better defender than Smart (heart and soul of our team too,) and why the fuck are we losing all of our guard depth? I'd rather keep Smart + PP over Lonzo Ball.  Ball is gonna get paid + RFA. We could lose him.   DEAL 3:  &gt;Celtics trade for: PJ Tucker   &gt;   &gt;Rockets get: Tristan Thompson and 2022 2nd Rd. Pick   &gt;   &gt;Use Exception to SIGN **Andre Drummond** \[offer him guaranteed big role\] and cut Theis/Wily  You're fucking high."
Jaylen brown  Jayson tatum  Daniel theis  Tristan thompson  Robert williams  Grant williams  Jeff teague  Kemba walker  Payton pritchard  Tacko fall  Tremont waters  Carsen edwards  Semi ojeleye  Javonte green  Marcus smart  Aaron nesmith  Romeo langford
"Pistons should absolutely do this. I love Grant and the effort he's put in this year but the Pistons are at least two seasons from really competing. He'd be on the last year of his deal by the time they are really looking to win.   Something like two firsts, a second and Aaron Nesmith would be a great haul for Detroit."
"Lets actually look at this list....   **Good Picks**   Luke Harangody - played 70 games as a 52nd pick   Avery Bradley - Good starter in playoff runs for Boston   Etwaun Moore - long career, 594 games and counting, 191 starts as the 55th pick   Jared Sullinger - started 182 games for Boston as a pick in the 20s   Marcus Smart   Terry Rozier - 16th pick, mocked as 2nd round, started a ECFs run for Boston, playing great   Abdel Nader - currently playing in Phoenix, 184 games as the 58th pick   Jaylen Brown   Semi Ojeleye - rotation player drafted in the 2nd round   Jayson Tatum   Robert Williams   Payton Pritchard   **No Value Expected**   Kris Joseph   Marcus Thornton   Ben Bentil   Demetrius Jackson   Jabari Bird   Kadeem Allen   **Moderate Value**   Jordan Mickey - 64 games, 4 starts as a 2nd round pick   **Bad Picks**   Fab Melo   James Young   RJ Hunter - only 45 ganes as 28th pick, not that bad   Ante Zizic &amp; Guerschon Yabusele - not great picks but they needed to draft stashes   **Not Drafted by Boston**   Marshon Brooks   Lucas Nogueira   **To be decided**   Grant Williams - has already closed playoff games for Boston but has had minutes reduced this season   Romeo Langford - looked pretty good, but injured   Yam Madar    Aaron Nesmith"
"He fixes literally all of the depth issues for the Celtics. Team defense is a different story, but right now our wing depth behind Tatum and Brown is   - Grant Williams, who is a 6'6"" Center with no athletic upside  - Semi Ojeleye, who lifts weights but is not necessarily good at basketball, per se  - Aaron Nesmith, who has as many DNP's as GP and is clearly not ready, nor do I blame him as a rookie  - Romeo Langford, who is a ghost with less than 400 minutes logged in his NBA career and who hasn't played in a calendar year.   Throwing an actual NBA level wing into the mix solves by far the biggest hole on the roster. Especially now with Robert Williams looking like he can be something at 5 for us, if we can avoid rolling Grant Williams and Ojeleye out in anything besides garbage time, we might actually be able to get some W's going  Doesn't matter though, because it doesn't seem like Detroit is interested in trading him at all, and we couldn't really offer a package good enough to get him anyways IMO."
Still baffled on how Aaron Nesmith was rated higher than Bane just from a 14 game sample size. Bane was a good shooter for 4 years at the college level. Just look his shot. So consistent in his form.
"How about a first , second, and lightly used Aaron nesmith?  Does that get us there?"
"Smart, rozier, brown, and Tatum went 6, 16, 3, 3. Since the Tatum draft, their first round picks have been:  2018: Robert Williams, 26th  2019: Romeo Langford, 14th. Matisse Thybulle, 20th (traded to philly). Grant Williams, 22nd.   2020: Aaron Nesmith, 14th. Payton Pritchard, 26th. Desmond Bane, 30th (traded to Memphis)  So basically your whole point was just trying to say that when you draft in the lottery, it’s easier to have good picks than when you draft in the teens and twenties lol. Hard hitting analysis buddy, thank you."
Center is not our biggest concern.  The biggest concern is depth at the 3/4.  We currently start 2 centers and our top 2 wings off the bench are semi Ojeleye and Aaron Nesmith.
[BOS] Aaron Nesmith
"The Celtics problems are Kemba.  There has not been a title contender in the modern era that wastes a max contract slot on a player of Kemba's caliber.  The fact is, in the NBA it is essentially impossible to build a true contender if you waste a max contract.  The Celtics are in year 4 of this (3 years of Hayward).  So unless they can first get rid of Kemba's $36M cap hit, nothing else matters because they're not gonna be able to contend with that contract anyway.  I also would not say most of their young players have disappointed?  Payton Pritchard has been a surprise and could develop into a decent scoring option off the bench, and Robert Williams seems like a promising young center.  And Aaron Nesmith has shot like 45% from three over the past couple months.  The Celtics just have way more young guys than most teams due to hoarding a lot of draft picks, but I don't think their ""hit rate"" is any different from what most teams would've had drafting in the same positions."
Aaron Nesmith has the most hustle I’ve ever seen. He would jump blindly into traffic if it meant saving a loose ball.
"Aaron ""Gerald 'Crash' Wallace"" Nesmith would be on the bench for the All Hustle Team"
"The Celtics are definitely talented enough to be a threat to any team. With the lack of consistency, it’s hard to bet on them, but they are definitely a threat.   This season was definitely a disappointment, but take that with a grain of salt. For three of the past 4 years, the Celtics have made it to the Easter conference finals, and heave been a top 4 seed each of those years. It’s only natural that anything other than greatness would be seen as coming short  Now, there is more talent in the eastern conference and the nba in general. Even the heat and Lakers, the two teams in last years finals, are struggling. Combine that with a season riddled with injuries amongst your stars and other key players, including and the virus still having a real effect on both Tatum and Fournier.   Realistically speaking, the Celtics will probably end around he seventh 7 and be in and win (at least) one of the play in tournament games, putting them in a first round series against the nets or sixers, and unfortunately both teams won all three games against the Celtics this year(and none were particularly super-close). That is an unfortunate, expected first round exit, which hasn’t happened since the 2015-2016 season against the hawks.   Let’s look on the bright side. The Celtics will most likely get an extended offseason, which means more rest for the injured stars who aren’t at 100%, and that rest is much deserved. Further, the Celtics rookies have really grown and have great impact on the team. Payton Prichard was amazing right off the bat, a great fill in for an injured walker. He is talented enough to be a starting point guard, and that’s amazing. Aaron Nesmith is a knock-down shooter with good size who is great at hustling and putting in efforts, and he gets so many rebounds. Also, Robert Williams has shown that he can THRIVE in a starting center position. Also, the Celtics are still a young team, they have time, and they will continue to improve."
"Danny Ainge, the guy who assembled the roster of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker (who was coming off a starting all-star season when we signed him), Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, Evan Fournier, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Tristan Thompson? one of the most solid and YOUNG 9-man rotations in the league? there are problems with this team, and none of them are Ainge"
"The point that you're missing there is that the team trading away the star player then gets saddled with a bunch of low value picks that they then stockpile to trade for the next wantaway star and so on and so on the cycle continues.   It's like a Ponzi scheme, and eventually those picks have to be selected, and can't be traded as hypothetical future assets anymore, and you end up like Boston - a supposed contender scrapping for 6th place in the East after being stuck with 3 relatively worthless first round picks and drafting Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard and Desmond Bane, none of whom move the needle towards winning a title in the short term.  So I'll repeat, why does anybody want to trade their star for these worthless picks?"
"The problem is our starting 5 is really all we have going for us.  Kemba/Smart/Brown/Tatum/Timelord is a arguably a top 5 starting 5 in the NBA, but our supporting cast stops and ends with Tristan Thompson and Evan Fournier. It's not completely awful, especially with the addition of Fournier, but the rest of our bench players are young and not ready to carry the load off the bench. Pritchard is maybe the closest, but he's still learning.  I'm not a doomer by any means, I think we have one of, if not the, brightest future of any team in the NBA, certainly in the eastern conference, but the fact of the matter is out role-players are a lot weaker than other contenders this year, and it would take all of our best 7 guys staying healthy throughout the entire playoffs, as well as an 8th/9th guy off the bench (one of Grant Williams, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, and Aaron Nesmith) making a big leap *in a playoff push* for us to really and truly contend."
But did they consider Aaron Nesmith?
"Because everyone around Jaylen and Tatum have been injured. It’s literally the same team that sweeped you guys last year +Evan Fournier, +Payton Pritchard, +Aaron Nesmith, with vast improvements from Jaylen. We have not played 100 minutes this season with our 5 best players healthy."
Aaron Nesmith out effort Keldon
Aaron Nesmith has been earning a spot on this list
Jayson Tatum and......Aaron Nesmith had more combined lol
Shoutout Aaron Nesmith!
Celtics legend Aaron Nesmith
And Aaron Nesmith
Aaron Nesmith
"Aaron Fucking Nesmith, man!!!!!!"
Aaron Nesmith
Jayson Tatum deserves so much better than someone like Jaylen Brown.  Jaylen Brown is an embarrassment to the Celtics jersey and he should be embarrassed he even considered himself to be Tatum's equal. Aaron Nesmith showed more hustle and heart in one game last game than Brown did for the entire season. But we all know Brown is going to make some feel-good PR message after the game so green teamers will forgive him.  Brown needs to personally apologize to Jayson Tatum and the rest of the team at the very minimum. I hope Danny Ainge trades him in the off-season.
Kings sub laughed at me when I said we should take Nesmith and a first for Barnes. Thank you for the validation Aaron!
AARON NESMITH
AARON NESMITH   Remember the name r/nba
"Our last five years :  Jaylen Brown, Semi Ojeleye, Jayson Tatum, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard  The Heats last five years :  Achiuwa, Herro, Adebayo  How is theirs better lol"
"Sounds like he has not, in fact, considered Aaron Nesmith."
Have you heard of Aaron Nesmith??
Aaron Nesmith
Aaron “Green Bean” Nesmith. That is all.
Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.  And Aaron Nesmith.
Aaron nesmith came up big too
"Danny had way too many draft picks to use and didn't find a trade he liked so ended up using all of them. Every year we seem to replace productivr established talent with rookie contracts. It all came to a head this year where we lost Gordon Hayward, Brad Wanamaker, and Enes Kanter with Payton Pritchard, and Aaron Nesmith. This season was always going to be hard with so much of the roster being made up of rookie contracts.    Look at all the other high seeds above above Boston and you see teams that added veterans. Milwaukee went out and got Holiday, Philly got Curry, Green and Dwight, Brooklyn sold the farm for Harden and filled out the roster with cheap veterans like Jeff Green.  The young players needed to get on the court and either show they're NBA level players or not so Ainge can finally make a decision on some of these guys. Pritchard broke out early and Timelord came on strong late."
So you could have ...check notes....aaron nesmith
*Aaron Nesmith
"End of bench guys (minutes played and +/-):  Carsen Edwards: 7:23, -18  Moritz Wagner: 5:11, -20  Aaron Nesmith: 4:26, -17  Semi Ojeleye: 3:43, -17  Tremont Waters: 3:43, -17"
"Jerry Stackhouse said Aaron Nesmith will be an all star, probably means nothing, but I’m just letting y’all know 😎"
Aaron Nesmith
Admittedly biased but Aaron Nesmith. Really came on strong the second half of the season. Started hitting shots and figured out defensive rotations. A real offseason will be great for him (and every rookie this season)
Aaron Nesmith /homer
"And Jaylen and Timelord were injured. And THJ ~ Fournier. Also Celtics were playing large minute Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Jabari Parker, Aaron Nesmith. I have hopes for their future but compared to  DFS, KP, Kleber etc they are definitely a tier below."
You want to package a first round pick and  Aaron Nesmith with Kemba?
Well I'm not putting much value on his opinion if he has Grant Williams higher than Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith
"At least he had 08 championship to fall back on, but he had a roster to go to finals with Brad Stevens as the coach. It was combination of injuries, personalities, and free agency which hinder those roster to reach the finals.  They have Brown and Tatum, but rarely anything else unless Celtic fans believe Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, and Grant Williams will get better. Is Kemba Walker knee going to hold up to his shifty moves he will put stress on his knees?"
"&gt;the guys we picked in the 20s (Pritchard, the Williamses) look better than the guys we picked at 14 (Langford, Nesmith)  ?????????????????????   Romeo and Aaron have both been significantly more impactful players than Grant Williams. Other than Robert Williams they're also the ones with the most potential to develop into something more than just a solid role players"
"word. not sure what the rules are, but i feel like it's prob alright to post specific sections:  #The tradable contracts and assets  Once you remove Tatum and Brown from any trade dialogue, Ainge and his front office are looking at a mixed bag of trade options.  **Expiring contracts: Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson**  Smart is the longest-tenured member of the Celtics' roster and Ainge has made it clear how valuable he is to the team.  ""Marcus plays as hard as anybody,"" Ainge said on ""Toucher and Rich"" after the trade deadline. ""He competes at a level that -- he's won playoff series for us with his, I wouldn't call it bravado, just with his intensity and his competitive spirit.""  Smart, who earned first-team All-Defensive honors in 2018-19 and 2019-20, is on an expiring $14.4 million contract, but is eligible for a contract extension. Boston or an acquiring team (six months after the trade) can add a total of four years and $74.4 million of new money. If there is no extension in place, Boston would have a decision to make with regard to the future of Smart.  Thompson is on a $9.7 million contract and could be a financial casualty if the Celtics sign Fournier. The 30-year-old averaged the second fewest minutes in his career (23.8), but still managed to put up 7.6 points and 8.1 rebounds. He had a +2.6 net rating in the 11 games in which he came off the bench.  **Recent draft picks: Robert Williams III, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford and Carsen Edwards**  Boston has five former first-round picks on rookie contracts, plus Edwards, who was a high second-round pick in 2019. While the Celtics' front office can be critiqued on their draft history, they have done a solid job drafting in the 20s, most notably the selections of Robert Williams (27 in 2018), Grant Williams (22 in 2019) and Payton Pritchard (26 in 2020).  Out of the six youngsters, Robert Williams III has the most value and upside of the group. He started 13 games in the regular season and is a candidate for an extension this offseason, making it unlikely that Boston would move him in a deal.  The jury is still out on their former lottery pick, Romeo Langford. Since the Celtics selected him No. 14 overall in 2019, the guard has spent more time on the inactive list as a result of injuries (and also COVID-19) than on the court. He has played in only 48 games his first two seasons, but did see considerable playing time in the playoffs in place of Jaylen Brown.  If there was a positive to a rather disappointing season, it is that Aaron Nesmith got better from the first time he stepped on the court until the end of the season. Nesmith averaged a season-high 9.2 points in May, shooting 55.9% from the field and 50% from 3.  **The former All-Star: Kemba Walker**  Walker still has $74 million left on his contract, including a $37.6 million player option for 2022-23 that he is all-but-certain to pick up.  Walker has averaged 20.4 and 19.2 points in his first two years in Boston, getting selected to the All-Star team in his first season. However, after missing six games in his final four years in Charlotte, Walker has missed 37 games over the past two seasons, and didn't play in back-to-backs this year.  According to ProFitX, Walker played $10 million below the actual value of his $34.4 million contract this year.  **The trade exceptions**  The Celtics were hard capped this past season, making it difficult for them to use their large, $28.5 million trade exception. However, starting Aug. 3, Boston will no longer have to operate below the apron, and will have three trade exceptions at its disposal to use: $11 million, $5.0 million and $4.8 million.  But like the case with re-signing Fournier or using its $5.9 million midlevel exception, there is an added cost associated as it relates to the luxury tax to acquiring a player via trade using the exceptions.  **The draft picks**  Despite trading four second-round picks as a part of the Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade and the March trade to acquire Fournier, the Celtics still have second-round picks in 2021, 2022 and 2026."
Aaron Nesmith.  Remember the name r/nba
"You have to give the younger guys a lot of slack.  Not only in general but especially this season.   * Limited pre-draft training * No summer league * Limited NBA offseason + camp * Limited Pre-Season * Less time in between games to practice * Teams haven't been able to practice on the road due to covid restrictions * The practice you do get is limited by covid restrictions as well (eg. number of coaches)  Being a rookie is tough, but this season must have been absurdly difficult.  We're seeing a similar thing with Aaron Nesmith.   Guy was a joke defensively out the gate and was still running Vanderbilt's no-middle defense while playing for us. It was like he was trying to ice 1-on-1 drives and giving guys free lanes inside.  Now he's starting to flash some really exciting potential on both ends of the floor and even led the league in 3P% for a month."
"Brad Stevens should be playing Carsen Edwards, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Semi Ojeleye, and Grant Williams 48 minutes. Develop the rookie and play guys you don't care about to save the stars from potential injury."
If Aaron Nesmith is healthy and a regular part of Boston’s rotation next season he’s going to put up 12-15 points per game. Not they it’s a huge number but he would be nearly tripling his scoring average as a rookie.
"You mean Jabari ""Six-foot-nine Ray Allen"" Parker and Aaron ""The Young Klay Thompson"" Nesmith?"
We just played Jabari Parker and Aaron Nesmith significant minutes in a playoff half and are beating the nets. How embarrassing for them
3 all stars struggling against Jabari Parker and Aaron Nesmith
"The average value of a double-digit pick just isn't that high, is the thing. Most players picked later in the draft just aren't going to be stars. Sure, we don't have the track record of, like, the Raptors wrt late firsts, but since 2015 we've had 9 first-round picks outside the top 10 (not including the ones we immediately traded), of which:  — 2 (Terry Rozier, Rob Williams) are already starting-caliber players  — 2 (Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard) project to be very solid NBA players going forward  — 2 (Romeo Langford, Grant Williams) are fringe NBA-caliber players, although we've seen so little of Langford that he could end up either a tier down or up  — 3 (RJ Hunter, Guerschon Yabusele, Ante Zizic) were complete misses  For late firsts, I don't think that's a bad track record at all. He hasn't *completely* missed on a first-rounder since 2016 (though we'll see about Langford)."
Hey at least it's not a real person. He thought Aaron Nesmith was Marcus Smart multiple times.
"He went the entirety of our game without realizing that Aaron Nesmith wasn't Marcus Smart, so my hopes aren't high"
"As a Celtics fan, I was reaaaally hoping to target him in a trade this summer. We really need a legit starting big who can keep Timelord healthy.  But it looks like this is out of the question now.  Maybe JJJ will be available tho? Memphis fans, any thoughts on this?   Boston needs a (spot) starting caliber PF and/or C this summer. I want Danny Ainge to target Kai Jones in the draft, buy we need another guy who can immediately step in as a starter or backup.   I've been pining for Val all year, thinking JJJ might be untouchable and Val was the more realistic target. I've also had my eye on SloMo and Justise. I wouldn't be opposed to Clarke or Tillman either.   On our end, we'd probably be offering up a package (pick 2) of: Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Grant Williams, Tristan Thompson, possibly even Timelord in the right deal. What would it take to make it happen?  JJJ + Kyle or Val + Justise for - Smart + (Romeo/Nesmith/Grant/TT) and 2 FRP's sound fair?"
"Beautiful pass from smart to smart. It's funny because when smart passed to nesmith instead of taking that open 3, I went like damn that's rare to see he usually takes that shot 10 out of 10 times but now it all makes sense. It wasn't Aaron in that corner it was smart."
Aaron Nesmith invented basketball according to Marv Albert.
"He came back from the break and said Aaron Nesmith, rookie from Vanderbilt once because someone obviously said something to him. He then proceeded to call him Smart like 4 more times. Time to hand up the microphone Marv"
i don't think he said Aaron or Nesmith one single time
Dude has called Aaron Nesmith Marcus Smart no less than 7 times
Aaron Nesmith is now Romeo Langford not Marcus Smart
According to Marv both Aaron Nesmith and semi ojoley are both Marcus smart.
"Anyone just hear Marv call Aaron Nesmith Marcus Smart when Smart was clearly on the other end lmao  And then his co-announcer just said Tatum had the most points in a game by a Duke player (60) and Marv asked him ""wait who?"""
Marv Albert had to of gotten Aaron Nesmith and Marcus Smart confused at least 5 times already
Holy shit Aaron Nesmith has mastered the Vulcan grip
Marv Albert called Aaron Nesmith Marcus Smart twice already and smart is on the bench lmao
"the announcers called Aaron Nesmith and then Semi Ojeleye ""Marcus Smart"" on back-to-back possessions"
"Rob Williams, Romeo Langford, Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith have earned their minutes and a chance for an expanded role next season, all the other young guys can go tbh"
"What is this parallel universe you're living in where Stevens didn't help develop Smart, Brown, and Tatum? Or perhaps Robert Williams, who was taken 27th and has become the team's best center in 3 years despite constantly dealing with injuries? Payton Pritchard is already playing very well, Aaron Nesmith started out poorly but has already improved a ton over the course of the season and has been balling lately. I guess Grant Williams is pretty ass. Do we blame Brad for Romeo Langford being perpetually injured? The rest of our ""young core"" is second rounders and two-way guys so I really fail to see what else he could have done here."
Knicks-Celtics was a freebie though.  Didn't check but that game alone must have been like -800 or more.  Celtics didn't play their top 7 and their best players were rookies Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith.  No one else who played would be in their playoff rotation if there were no injuries.
A better version of this list  1 Timberwolves select Anthony Edwards  2 Warriors select Lamelo Ball  3 Hornets select Tyrese Haliburton  4 Bulls select Patrick Williams  5 Cavs select Isaac Okoro  6 Hawks select Killian Hayes  7 Pistons select Devin Vassell  8 Knicks select James Wiseman  9 Wizards select Onyeka Okongwu (honestly Wiseman and Okongwu could go either way)  10 Suns select Deni Avdija  11 Spurs select Aaron Nesmith  12 Kings select Kira Lewis Jr  13 Pelicans select Obi Toppin  14 Celtics select Jalen Smith
 Aaron Nesmith isn’t getting drafted over Onyeka or Hayes after year one  Also toppin is definitely pick 12/13
"I have no idea who Aaron Nesmith is, this only scares me more"
"Here's why Romeo ""Savior"" Langford will not become much of anything: had no idea 2 seconds were on the shot clock on an inbound. If you have no awareness and minimal skill you're done! Thankfully for Boston Aaron Nesmith is already way better than Langford."
"Here's why Romeo ""Savior"" Langford will not become much of anything: had no idea 2 seconds were on the shot clock on an inbound. If you have no awareness and minimal skill you're done! Thankfully for Boston Aaron Nesmith is already way better than Langford."
"The last 10 drafts below. Out of 20 picks, only Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ and Julius Randle are on the level of Pascal and you could argue he is better than all of them. You are way more likely to get guys like Coby White and Romeo Langford than a Jamal Murray and Bam Adebayo.  7th picks: Killian Hayes, Coby White, Wendall Carter, Lauri Markannen, Jamal Murray, Emmanuel Mudiay, Julius Randle, Ben McLemore, Harrison Barnes, Bismack Biyombo  14th picks: Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, MPJ, Bam Adebayo, Denzel Valentine, Cameron Payne, TJ Warren, Shabazz Muhammad, John Henson, Marcus Morris"
"Yeah I think it’s much easier to build around and win with Brown and Tatum than it is with Trae and Collins. With another true star besides Trae I’ll look at them in a different light.   And I don’t really know about The Celtics but them being frauds was never really something people said. We didn’t have Jaylen in the playoffs and he’s crucial to the teams success. Assuming that Brown is back next year and him and Tatum both take another leap I see the Celtics being an extremely talented team. Replacing Kemba with Horford is a great decision as well and the Celtics have the 5th youngest roster in the league. With more development to key players like Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams III, Grant Williams, and hopefully the addition of last year’s draft and stash Yam Madar the team should take a big step forward."
"Marcus smart , tristan Thompson , payton pritchard  , aaron nesmith   For both of them"
Nah man having absolutely no awareness of Outkast is inexcusable.   Like the next generation might not know who Aaron Nesmith is but this would be like them not knowing who Steph Curry is.
"He's untouchable from an asset standpoint even more than being a 24 year old All-Star 25 PPG scoring wing. We are not in a great cap situation even after the Kemba trade, we have SOME flexibility, but losing Jaylen at 25 Mil and replacing him with Lillard means that one of Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, or Grant Williams is now a starter, and there isn't really a ton we can do about it. If we don't re-sign Fournier  and we also trade JB, our wing depth (which is already not good) is totally fucked. I realize I'm comparing a bunch of pieces to a top 10 player, but I think losing JB would make it incredibly hard to put an actually dangerous team around Lillard and Tatum.   I doubt the Celtics are in on that if it requires Brown, and I don't think we can put together anything good enough without him. r/bostonceltics is OBSESSED with the Beal/Tatum St. Louis connection, but the same thing applies there as well. Just doesn't seem realistic."
"We eventually have to start thinking about drafting rookies, you know.  I’m probably gonna get downvoted to oblivion but this is quite inevitable, the Warriors are bout to pay the repeater tax and our owner Joe Lacob can’t be spending some infinite amount of luxury tax to sign or trade for veterans, especially those that make 8 figures for their salary. Steph, Klay, Dray and Wiggins combined to make about $140 million next year, which is more than all but 3 teams’ entire payroll this year.   I mean, how many players are realistically difference makers that are worth the 7th and/or the 14th pick, especially at around $9 million which Killian Hayes at Aaron Nesmith, players drafted at #7 and #14 last year, combined to make?   Barring significant trades and injuries, #7 is as high as we’re going to picking in the next couple of years. And unless a really good role player is available for the right price, I just can’t see how trading for a vet helps them. And realistically the best chance at that kind of deal is with a Kelly Oubre sign-and-trade and even that is very unlikely.   TL;DR: It’s really hard to get good value out of trading these picks unless they’re packaged with Wiseman or Wiggins, given the rookie salaries of these draftees. And if they’re going to trade Wiseman and/or Wiggins, they’d have to get a lot. I mean, a lot."
"&gt;Robert Williams III, Marcus Smart, Aaron Nesmith, and a 2023 FRP.  This is not enough for the #10 pick, much less the #1 pick."
"With that being said. Robert Williams III, Marcus Smart, Aaron Nesmith, and a 2023 FRP. If it’s not enough for the first pick than I don’t want the first pick.   lol"
"&gt; Robert Williams III, Marcus Smart, Aaron Nesmith, and a 2023 FRP.   Keep this delusional shit in the team sub."
"Yeah he’s a terrible GM. Selecting trash players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Avery Bradley, etc.  What a stupid comment"
Well I did say that I doubt Brad would deal Aaron Nesmith but the Wolves already have an abundance of SG's so Romeo doesn't entice the Wolves probably.
Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith are two on the current roster that are turning out quite nicely.
"Moses Brown shot 60.2% from shots within the 5 ft from the basket.  To contextualize, here are some other OKC players’ number.  Tony Bradly - 74.4  Kenrich Williams - 65.7  Mike Muscala - 64.4  Jaylen Hoard - 63.3  SGA - 61.2  Svi - 60.6  Isaiah Roby - 60.3  All better than the only 7 footer on the team.  Some Celtics Numbers for more comparison  Jabari Parker - 85  Robert Williams - 78.4  Luke Kornet - 77.8  Tacko Fall - 75  Tatum - 65.9  Brown - 62.9  Semi Ojeleye - 62.9  Romeo Langford - 62.5  Aaron Nesmith - 61.7  Kemba - 61.7  Grant Williams - 61.1"
"He was great to start the year all through All Star break. Towards the end though, Aaron Nesmith was playing better than PP.  The whole team was messed up anyways so I don’t blame PP. He’s a fucking bucket though and after some disastrous drafting since Tatum, we’ve finally got ourselves a good draft class in PP &amp; Nesmith."
I’m pretty high on Aaron Nesmith.
I'm dying thinking about Stevens nuking the team for picks and Middleton lmao..  Starting lineup:  PG: Dennis Schroder SG: Khris Middleton SF: Aaron Nesmith PF: Enes Kanter C: Robert Williams  Come on that gets MAYBE 10th seed in the East..
"You are missing guys in that list...Here's his career drafting history in the 11-30 range:    Decent Picks| Bad Picks | Unknowns ---|---|---- Kendrick Perkins| Marcus Banks| Romeo Langford Tony Allen |  Delonte West| Grant Williams Al Jefferson|Gerald Green  | Aaron Nesmith Rajon Rondo|J.R. Giddens  |   Avery Bradley|JaJuan Johnson |  Kelly Olynyk|Jared Sullinger|  Terry Rozier| Fab Melo   |  Robert Williams| James Young    |  Payton Pritchard| RJ Hunter|    |Ante Zizic |  |Guerschon Yabusele|  With 9 good picks and 11 bad ones, he's pretty much bang on 50% in that range.  Also worth mentioning, the last 2 'bad picks' (Zizic and Yabusele) were just guys we grabbed who were willing to be stashed for a year because we needed to clear roster spots for incoming stars Al Horford and Gordon Hayward."
"- Jayson Tatum  - Jaylen Brown  - Marcus Smart  - Robert Williams  - Payton Pritchard  - Aaron Nesmith  - Dennis Schroder  - Romeo Langford  Al would be nice to keep, but if he's taken that means we get off of his contract. Richardson isn't a long-term player for us. The rest of the young guys can go."
"Tyrese Haliburton  Wendell Carter Jr.  Deni Avidja  As a Celtics fan... Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford and Payton Pritchard  I still believe in Markelle Fultz... he won't ever be a superstar in the strictest sense of the word or the best player in his draft class but he has a Jrue Holiday type ceiling  Jamal Murray I think his ceiling is a lot higher than probably most people think. I wanted the Celtics to draft him 3rd in his draft"
Aaron Nesmith boys. Lock it in.
"Lauri Markkanen, Aaron Nesmith, Aleksej Pokusevski, Jordan Poole, Chuma Okeke, Robert Williams, Tyrese Maxey."
"Aaron Nesmith. He’s already an amazing shooter, he hustles in defense every time and has started working on his all-around offensive game, in addition to his increasingly good defense. I fully expect him to become a starter by the start of the 2022-23 season"
Aaron Nesmith
"Aaron Nesmith gonna win MIP and the Celtics are going to be 1st place in the East 33 games in, end up 2nd, and make the conference finals"
Aaron Nesmith for tomorrow’s poll
Aaron Nesmith and Sam Hauser beg to differ
"* I could see Malik Beasley hit 25ppg with everyone on the Wolves healthy.  * Derrick White could have had a breakout season last year but couldn't get healthy.   * Jalen Brunson is really good, but maybe we won't see him flourish until he leaves the Mavs.  * Maybe not MIP, but TJ Warren will have another excellent and totally ignored season. 20ppg on 60 TS%.  * Nickeil Alexander Walker will have some massive games, but struggle with consistency.  * If we are allowed sophmores, I think Haliburton and Patrick Williams will have big leaps. Maybe Aaron Nesmith and Devin Vassell."
"Not one mention of Naji Marshall, Tre Jones, or Aaron Nesmith in the article. All 3 have been absolutely amazing so far."
"Celtics will be a fun team with a lot to prove. They had a disappointing season last year going .500, being forced into the play-in, and then getting gentleman’s swept in the first round.    Tatum is clearly a star, but he hasn’t broken into “top 5” players in the league territory which he believes he is. Coming off a gold medal, this is his season to prove he should be in that top 5 conversation.    Schroder passed up $84 mil to sign for $5 mil and wants to prove he’s worth a big contract after this season. Look for him to ball out.    They also have a bunch of former first round picks who have shown potential but haven’t established themselves in the league yet. Guys like Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, and Aaron Nesmith will get a chance to show what they’ve got.     They also have a new coach in Ime Udoka who’s never been a head coach before and wants to prove he belongs."
"Cam Reddish  Romeo Langford or Aaron Nesmith (probably just one of those 2)  Darius Garland (maybe he's too good or obvious for that list)  PJ Dozier  Malik Monk  Jaren Jackson Jr. (think this is the year he turns it around)  Tyrese Maxey  Kira Lewis or Nickeil Alexander Walker (same as the Boston guys, not sure they can both breakout at the same time)  Malachi Flynn"
i am high off Summer League games right now. Aaron Nesmith is Ray Allen with hair. Scottie Barnes is Giannis with thigh high socks. Bol Bol is Jesus in a basketball jersey.
"Aaron ""James"" Nesmith"
Post Aaron Nesmith ankle breaker cowards
"Big deal. The Celtics will do that too when they play the Yam Mader, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, and Robert Williams lineup."
"Get out of here, Celtics Romeo Langford and even more so, Aaron Nesmith going to dominate this yr.  That's with smart, Tatum and brown.  Timelord, horford, and kanter not too too bad, either.  Knicks are grasping, Celtics have developed.  See you in June, and with $ to spare."
"He's wrong about that though, but this is what I've seen a bunch of Celtics fans telling themselves to try to justify why the front office has made the moves they have. To get Beal in free agency, the Celtics would have to find a way to salary dump Horford with no money coming back, they'd have to let Marcus Smart and Robert Williams simply walk in free agency, and they'd have to renounce basically everyone except for Tatum and Brown and maybe Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith. That's about the only way they could get $50 million under the cap, which is what they'd need to create the necessary cap space to make Beal a max offer next summer, and that all seems incredibly unrealistic.   They could try to figure out a trade for Beal this season, but that would probably involve Jaylen Brown, and I don't think Boston wants to do that. I think if Washington gets any sense that Beal may actually leave next summer then they'll probably trade him this summer or upcoming season rather than let it go to free agency, but I could be wrong.   What Boston is actually doing is just trying to get under the luxury tax. Tatum's extension kicked in this off-season and that made it so Boston either needed to make some cuts or go into the tax. So they gave up a 1st to swap Kemba for Horford and save some money there, and then they let Fournier walk, replacing him with Josh Richardson for about $8 million less than Fournier would have cost. And now apparently the sides are very far apart on a Marcus Smart extension because what Smart wants will put Boston in the tax a year from now, especially since they're gonna have to pay Robert Williams as well.   The big indicator that this ""max cap space in 2022"" thing is bogus will be if they trade Marcus Smart once extension talks truly break down. If this ""no contracts beyond 2022"" thing is true, then Smart being an expiring would be just what they're looking for. But instead my guess is if they can't extend him, they'll trade him rather than just have him walk in free agency like Horford, Hayward, Kyrie and Fournier did. I just don't think it's realistic that Boston would risk the total decimation of their team in the hopes that Beal signs with them. If he didn't they'd be absolutely fucked, and there's simply no way they can count on him doing that. It's just not a realistic plan for any team to have."
I feel Aaron Nesmith will breakout this year
"RJ Barrett. Jaden McDaniels.   Anthony Edwards will be a legitimate all star and the Wolves will fight for a play-in where nobody wants to play them.   Also not star, but as a role player Aaron Nesmith is going to surprise a lot of people. Think Danny Green esque role player."
Way out there pick? Aaron Nesmith. Came on strong at the end of the year and if Fournier isn’t re signed he might get starter minutes and really breaks out
"I think we are going to see lots of 2nd year players break out this next season by virtue of having a more full &amp; complete offseason program to participate in.  Last year's rookies had no summer league, no training camp, no access to the G League for reps and very little practice time with their teams during the compressed season.  With a year under their belts in the NBA and the opportunity for summer league this offseason I think we'll see lots of guys make significant jumps this next year.  I very much hope that one of those guys is Aaron Nesmith, who came on down the stretch of last season and could have an opportunity for regular minutes with the Celtics this next coming year."
Celtics notable draft pick over the last 5 years;  - Jayson Tatum - Jaylen Brown - Robert Williams - Aaron Nesmith - Payton Pritchard  - Romeo Langford - Grant Williams - Semi Ojeleye  - yeah it falls off pretty hard now
He called Aaron Nesmith Marcus Smart like 4 times in 1 game and called Romeo Marcus Smart once in that same game. He's a legend but damn he fell off.
"&gt;The Sixers asked for Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, former lottery picks Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith along with two future first-rounders in exchange for Ben Simmons, according to multiple sources. The Celtics quickly turned down the offer.  This will be the next report. 5....4....3....2....1"
"I forgot about Williams, but he's about to be an RFA after this season anyway. And I can guarantee you teams around the league aren't trading a star player in the hopes of getting back Romeo Langford or Aaron Nesmith as the centerpieces. They have some value due to their age and contract but their worth is closer to a second-round pick at this point, I personally don't think they're moving the needle in a trade for someone of Beal's caliber"
"Aaron Nesmith. I think he’ll be one of the more elite 3&amp;D role players in his prime. He made such a huge leap over the course of last season, so I think he’ll get a lot better this year now that he’ll have a full training camp and summer league."
"Bagley, Delon Wright and #7 for Marcus Smart, Aaron Nesmith, and a future pick."
"The package I saw was Smart, Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, grant Williams and like 4 FRP and swaps. Definitely a solid package but it pretty much guts us and doesn’t give the Wiz a real building block player."
"I'm not understanding your comment. What do Aaron Nesmith and Payton Pritchard have to do with the Brooklyn/Houston trade? Houston got 4 FRP, 4 swaps and was able to match salary by taking guys on lucrative 1 year deals which frees up cap in FA. They were also working on a lottery pick of their own. What mid-level team in the NBA is giving 4 FRP? Brooklyn doesn't need those assets as bad as a team like, say, the Kings or Cavs do. No one is matching that for a rental for a guy who's made it clear he only wants to play for one team. Harden was disgruntled with a team that's made the post-season every year he's played there, and has been to the WCF.   They definitely don't deserve shit for not offering more if they feel the risk is not worth the reward. And many teams that were even in the running didn't have the draft capital to match (which is what Houston wanted, not players)."
I would literally rather get a package equivalent to that 1 year rental than a package centered around Aaron Nesmith and Payton Pritchard lmfao. That is so easy to beat even for a 1 year rental  I would literally rather take a lottery pick in this draft than both those players
"The Celtics don't have a single player after Jaylen Brown on the level of LeVert and Allen, unless you want to count Fournier, who is technically a Free Agent, and it's still questionable. The Celtics could not put together a Harden style package without Jaylen Brown, so the Beal thing will never happen. Stars that shoot their way out of town generally don't get traded for another star, but people still underrate what Brooklyn gave up to get him. Basically every team in the league could have used LeVert or Allen this past year, including Brooklyn. The Wiz would be comically stupid to trade Beal for Aaron Nesmith and Robert Williams, for example."
"By that logic Boston trading Rob Williams, Aaron Nesmith,  and Smart and picks seems like it would be competitive which I don't honestly believe. Smart is better than anyone in your package, Rob Williams serves the same role as Mitchell Robinson and Aaron Nesmith showed promise and is younger than Obi.  If you think that Boston's package wouldn't be enough (which I would agree with) you should recognize that the Knicks package is at best on par with it."
"I know I know boo hoo, but the Celtics luck under the curse of Isaiah Thomas has been kind of crazy. Hayward's leg and subsequent injuries. Kyrie's... whatever the fuck that was that Kyrie did. Lottery picks from the basement-dwelling Kings and the Grizzlies turning into Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith instead of, like, Zion Williamson and Tyrese Haliburton. The worst 2020-2021 covid shitstorm in the league.  I can't be mad or anything, because we were probably the luckiest team in the league for the three years prior. Scary Terry almost took us to the finals for fuck's sake."
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"
"I disagree. I see this lineup as a bottom 5 defensive lineup. LaVine and DeRozan are decent Shot creators but not high end ones. And both are bad at best on defense with LaVine being just merely bad and DeRozan being one of the worst in the league.  Also Boston also has Horford, Smart (who I'd take over everyone besides LaVine on the Bulls), Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, Dennis Schroeder, Josh Richardson, Grant Williams. Celtics have better high end talent and better depth."
"Well for one injuries. Kemba, Smart, Brown, and Tatum only played 18 games together last season. Ik Kenna’s gone obviously, But just having Smart, Brown, and Tatum on the court together will make the team improve. A lot of games last year they were playing with just one or 2 of them. Also theCeltics were right in that 3-4 seed range when Tatum came down with COVID, and when he came back we were in the 8 seed range. Even with a month left In the season they were at the 4 seed, then a losing streak dropped them down to 7.   Other than injuries which were a big part of last season for most teams, the Celtics defense should improve, getting rid of Kemba and Tristian, bringing in better defensive players like Horford and Richardson. Also Aaron Nesmith played well last year, and could make a jump to a pretty good rotation piece, he was already solid defensively last year, and his offense should improve this year, he was a knockdown shooter in college I could see him having a very good year.   Next is Robert Williams, who is an all star level player if Healthy, which I know is a big if. Next is ball movement, where the Celtics really struggled last year, but with bringing in a new coach I think some of those problems like the offense getting stagnant and iso ball will change.   And finally, The biggest reason is Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. I think that duo is better than any one in the east besides Nets/Bucks, and expect each to take a step forward, Tatum has MVP potential imo. Obviously it might not all work out, but if each team reaches their ceiling I could see the Celtics being as high as the 3rd seed, and I think it’s really close between them and the Heat, but I give the Celtics the edge because of the stars. But it is very close, not much difference between the 3-6 seeds it seems."
"Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, 2 unprotected firsts, plus salary filler"
"I feel like this one's pretty obviously Robert Williams, but Aaron Nesmith might also be up there— if he can take a big leap this year, he's a *way* better fit next to our other starters than Josh Richardson or Dennis Schroder just because of the spacing he provides. He's got legit 3&amp;D potential."
Aaron Nesmith
"**Trade 1:** Warriors get big 3 with Beal  **Details:** Beal and Thomas Bryant to Warriors for Wiggins, one of Kuminga or Moody, Wiseman, and 2/3 FRPs  **Explanation:** Warriors need some more spark given how limited Draymond is offensively now. Beal hopefully finally wants out. Wizards get a young piece in Kuminga/Moody and Wiseman along with 2/3 FRPs and a great starter in Wiggins.   &amp;#x200B;  **Trade 2:** Dame finally asks out  **Details:** Dame and A. Simmons to Celtics for JB, Rob Williams, Josh Richardson, Aaron Nesmith and 2/3 FRPs  **Explanation:** Dame and JT make the Celtics an actual threat for the next 2-3 years while Dame is still good. No way Portland says yes without getting at least JB in return, good starter in Rob Williams, and a good young piece in Nesmith. J. Rich mostly in there for salary matching. And of course, picks.  &amp;#x200B;  **Trade 3:** Luka hopefully gets a more reliable scoring option next to him and some defense  **Details:** KP for Evan Fournier, Nerlens Noel, and Kevin Knox   **Explanation:** KP has been trash for the Mavs and needs a change in scenery. Luka gets a 18 ppg consistent shooter in Fournier, a great defensive big and lob threat in Noel, and Kevin Knox as a ball boy at practice."
Khris Middleton.   Anthony Johnson had a good career and hopefully Aaron Nesmith will too
"Payton Pritchard and Aaron Nesmith with both end up starting for the Celtics down the line and they will be heavily compared to Derek Fisher on Kobe's Lakers and Ray Allen on the Celtics, respectively"
"Aaron Nesmith, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard"
"I'm just wondering - how much better is the current Sixers team than the version from the 2020 bubble?  How much worse is the current Celtics team than the version from the 2020 bubble?  Personally I feel like the Sixers are about the same (although they lost Simmons in those Bubble playoffs which hurt them), but the Celtics should be better.  Tatum/Brown have developed more, and then you would expect at least SOME of the guys like Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Pritchard, and Grant Williams to take a step forward.  Add in solid-to-great role players in Schroder, Smart, Richardson, and Horford; the addition-by-subtraction of Kemba (if he could get out of street clothes, he was good on occasion but was too regularly terrible and just took the ball out of other guy's hands), and I don't see how this Celtics team is worse.  I think this season is gonna surprise a lot of people, not just the Boston Celtics.  People are looking at the results of the 2021 season and think the landscape of the NBA have changed a ton since the 2020 season.  But I really think 2021 is a huge outlier due to all of the nonsense caused by COVID.  There is a lot of noise in that data to try to draw any real conclusions from it."
Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Robert Williams III  Payton Pritchard  Aaron Nesmith   Romeo Langford  Grant Williams   Uhh Carsen Edwards / Bruno Fernando   Certainly gives the Hawks a run for their money
"No, those guys are salary filler    The actual assets would be Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, and unprotected first round picks"
"Horford, Richardson, 3 1sts and 3 pick swaps? That enough? Or we need to add in Timelord or Pritchard or Aaron Nesmith?"
"Nesmith is the Grizzlies pick and Langford was the Kings pick. Honestly a ton of time left for both, especially Aaron"
Aaron Nesmith
Aaron Nesmith
"Curious to see what percentage of the turnover nightmare in the Raps game will be our running average.   Like you say, the talent’s there and the fit’s weird. In fact, I think we’re vastly deeper than last year, but that depth is only effective on defense without motion in the offense. Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith can both ball, now, but both in a way that’s very redundant with Tatum and Brown; Schröder and Richardson are both fine rotation players, but again we’d be infinitely better off if one was prime JJ Barea, or Jalen Brunson.  Good read."
"I want to see what guys like Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith have in store for year 2.  They were able to get in a full offseason, summer league &amp; training camp this year which they didn't have last year so I am hoping it helps accelerate their development.  Both looked like solid rotational players last year, now it's time to see if they can succeed in those roles.  The minutes will be there..."
1. Romeo Langford.  2. Aaron Nesmith.  3. Robert Williams.  4. Jordan Poole.  5. Terrence Mann.  6. Jordan Nwora.  7. Isaiah Joe.  8. Mikal Bridges.  9. OG Anunoby.  10. Tyrese Haliburton.

"All my theory’s are stupid as fuck but they make watching games I don’t care about more fun. Especially watching with friends. So here they are. -Robin Lopez never played for the bucks, it was Brook in a wig the whole time.   -Payton Pritchard actually wanted to be the leprechaun mascot for the Celtics but signed the wrong contract, and he’s Irish and is fueled by beer and potatoes. (I know these are dumb stereotypes but that’s what makes it funny)  -Aaron Nesmith is James Nesmiths son, frozen in time and given the instructions to the commissioner on when to be awakened. This means he’s Adams son as well  -lastly ( that I can think of right now) Brad Stevens is a mutant clone of Frank Vogel that was supposed to sabotage the Celtics but went rouge.  Btw I’m not really a Celtics fan I have no clue why I have so many theories about them. Anyways that’s my Ted talk, thanks for listening."
Aaron Nesmith
"But it's still not enough offense, you have to ship out sabonis for a good offensive player. Maybe something like:       marcus smart to the jazz      sabonis to the celtics      jordan clarkson and aaron nesmith to the pacers.  I don't think this makes enough sense but maybe it could be tweaked"
RJ Barrett  Markelle Fultz  Aaron Nesmith   Are all my picks
It was random dude like 2 pages into google lol. I was looking for what I wanted on that one.  [found it](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/2020-nba-draft-sleepers-aaron-nesmith-compares-warriors-klay-thompson)
Still incredible to go 7/7 even on open 3s. The Celtics drafted Aaron Nesmith for the sole purpose of shooting 3s and he's shooting 22% on wide open 3s lmao
Any day now Remeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith are going to break out
"Ok so let’s just pretend that luka demands a trade after losing in the first round of the playoffs again, since that’s hypothetically the only way the Mavericks would listen to offers. You’d have to look for something like the Harden package but way, way better, because 1) the Harden trade sucked for the rockets and 2) Luka is only 22. So the most competitive offers would probably look like:  Boston offering Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, and Marcus Smart (maybe? idk how the contracts would work) and all their picks  Pelicans offer Ingram, Alexander-Walker, Herb Jones and picks  Sixers offer Simmons, Maxey, Danny Green, Korkmaz and picks  Timberwolves send a paltry offer of Malik Beasley, D-Lo, McDaniels, Nowell and all their picks  Kings send a slightly less insulting offer of Fox, Bagley, and Davion Mitchell along with all of their picks  Maybe the Pacers get involved with Brogdon and Duarte?  Thunder could be in the mix with their millions of picks, although there’s no way Luka would demand a trade just to get sent to OKC lol.   Off the top of my head those are the only teams that could/would throw together some big trade package if Luka wants out.   Plus, when it comes to picks, you’d be looking at ~8 firsts (4 unprotected firsts, 4 pick swaps)  Obviously none of these trades match his value, but when your star player publicly demands a trade you begin to lose leverage and have to start looking for the best deal available.   Pelicans and Thunder have the best draft assets of the teams listed, Sixers and Celtics have the best talent offered. I’d be most inclined to take the either the Sixers or Pelicans deal, but I’d still try to squeeze every last asset I could get out of them."
"---------- ""I can't believe this whole era for them hasn't really worked,"" one league executive said. ""They're stuck in neutral -- and maybe going backwards.""  In the span of three years, the franchise underwent a steep and steady talent drain:  *    Irving, Horford and Morris left via free agency.  * The picks from the Kings and Grizzlies turned into the 14th selection in consecutive seasons, netting Boston a pair of reserve swingmen in Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith.  * Rozier was sent to the Charlotte Hornets in the sign-and-trade deal to land Kemba Walker, who was subsequently sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder along with a first-round pick for Horford.  * The trade exception created when Hayward left became two months of Evan Fournier and then Josh Richardson.  * Coach Brad Stevens left the sidelines to replace Danny Ainge as president of basketball operations.  The result? Boston now is short both on high-end talent and high-end assets to build around its young stars.  ""Ultimately, you can't keep losing -- albeit flawed -- All-Star talent like Kyrie, Gordon, Kemba, Horford,"" an Eastern Conference scout said. ""That adds up.""  -----------"
"&gt;Aaron Nesmith: 0 points (0-1), 2 turnovers, -14 (+/-), in 10 minutes  &gt;Aleksej Pokusevki: 0 points (0-1), 2 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 turnovers, -10 (+/-) in 9 minutes  both were drafted over Tyrese Maxey btw"
So sad that Romeo Langford is getting more playing time than Aaron Nesmith
"All I want for Hanukkah is for Aaron ""Best Shooter in the Draft"" Nesmith to become a genuine sharpshooter."
"If Boston wins this we claim the letter B and Bucks have to trade us three players of our choice as compensation (we will take Giannis, Middleton, and Holiday in exchange for Grant Williams, Aaron Nesmith, and Romeo Langford)."
"Jalen Brunson: on a team where he isn't forced to play off the ball/come off the bench he could put up some great numbers - I think he is so much better than his stats indicate and is being held back in Dallas.  Moses Moody: one of my favourites from this draft class, can't really get on the court because Warriors.  Malik Beasley: Really talented shooter/scorer, has had a very slow start but they've cut his role/minutes/usage. Kinda sucks because he was in a bad situation (in terms of available minutes) in Denver, and has now been kind of pushed to the side in Minnesota after playing so well for them last year.  Devin Vassell: He's gonna be a star, but in traditional Pop fashion he's being brought along very slowly. He's gonna get minutes eventually there and I know they love him but still wish he was given a bit more leash like he would on another team.  Aaron Nesmith: Talented kid, confidence I think has been an issue for him and don't think Boston for numerous reasons is the best place for him to flourish.  Cam Reddish: Begging to break out, but Atlanta has so many wings that his minutes are capped and inconsistent.  Patrick Williams: He's hurt right now, but I feel like they went into win-now so fast that he's kind of been left behind. He looked amazing in summer league and then barely got shots on the actual team - granted he didn't deserve shots over their other guys but still he has so much potential and I think he would reach it much faster on another team on a better suited timeline for him.  Jordan Nwora: Really talented scorer and showed out a bit with a lot of people hurt, and probably earned a rotation spot - but when everyone is healthy that role gets smaller and smaller. I wonder how he'd do on another team.  Marcus Garrett: Less of a 'free him' and more of a name to watch, he's a crazy defender and I think will be one of those Heat rotation players that comes out of nowhere in a year or two.  Paul Reed: I want to see what he can do as a starting center with big minutes, dude can really play but he's behind Embiid and Drummond (and probably their PFs too)"
"If it’s not dame then they could pull that trigger at any time. Didn’t Portland and Philly talk about a cj trade in the off season but Philly wanted too much ?  And if Portland decides to move dame, plenty of teams could outbid Philly.  What’s Philly’s best case scenerio package ? Thybulle Ben maxey and some 1sts? Okc has their 2025 1st barring protections, which means they can’t trade 2026 or 2024. So 1sts from 2023 and 2027 ig?  Golden state could package together 1sts from 2022 and 2026 along with moody, kuminga, poole and wiseman. 3 very young lotto picks bursting with potential and a young MIP front runner.   Boston could offer more picks around Jaylen brown, maybe toss in Robert Williams and Aaron Nesmith.   Knicks could package RJ Barrett, all the picks they have which is like all of their own and a few from other teams, and young guys like Toppin and quickly"
"2 PM: Ben Simmons announces he's returning to the team, is delighted to be a 76er, and wants to win a title in Philly.  3 PM: Shams reveals that the reason Simmons is staying is that the 76ers are catering to his demands, building the team around him, and are finalizing a trade of Joel Embiid for Jaylen Brown, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, and a 1st round pick."
"Eh, I mean Al Horford may be washed and Aaron Nesmith may be a bust but given larger sample sizes both are most definitely going to be better 3 point shooters than Simmons.  Simmons has actually managed to have Marcus Smart type efficiency from the arc the last 2 years on paper (.300 and .286) but that's on 17 attempts and with, I'm guessing, no one within 8 feet of him for almost all of those shots. He has still never hit a playoff 3, he's famously averse to effectively taking coaching on his 3 point shooting, and is famously afraid to shoot.  Moreover it's not just 3s. Last year Simmons only took 15 shots from further than 14 feet out. From 10-14 feet he was 11/37 for a 29.7% FG%. His spacing issues aren't just a matter of his limitations at the arc, he's just not much of a threat to shoot until he gets within 10 feet. That's a huge problem for Smart, but it's an even bigger problem for a star player you try to build your team around.  Al Horford's taken 40 shots from &gt;14 feet out *this* season. Last year he shot 50% from 10-14 feet on 28 attempts and 43.8% from 15-19 feet on 32 attempts.  And, of course, Simmons is a star player who's on the ball a lot so his shooting limitations represent a particularly big impact.  Importantly I think the book on how to make use of Simmons is pretty clear: ideally you'd surround him with guys who can shoot making it easy to open up the lane and maximizing the spacing you can get with him on the floor. The Celtics, um, can't do that, especially if they're shipping out Brown.  The team that trades for Simmons should be a team that's particularly good at shooting the 3, not particularly bad at it."
Literally no reason to play JRich over Aaron and/or Romeo at this point. They’re both competent on D and can shoot. Nesmith plays harder than 99% of the league
"Your points are understandable. In response, He may have spoken his feelings after one game but that's not a reflection of just this game only. For the last couple seasons, Celtics fans have been complaining about playmaking on offense, play calling on offense and personnel. And on nights it works, it's not an issue and everyone's happy and when it doesn't, people get rightfully mad about it. The team is the same general makeup with a few subtractions and additions and when the same problems as usual come up, the same frustrations will too.  1. From a playmaking perspective, everyone we've had so far in the last 3 years is fine, passable but not terrific. This includes Kyrie, Kemba, the Jays and everyone else. Hayward was generally excluded from this as our best passer along with Horford but Horford left and Hayward was never fit. They Jays have improved on this aspect, yes, but not enough. When they struggle to get a shot, as you can see often from whenever Aaron Nesmith or Pritchard got the ball last year, or even lobs to Rob Williams, the pass is just a bit off. Enough that they can't go straight up and shoot it off the passes.  2. Play calling/offense. It's a lot of isos or 2 man screen game if any. It's a lot of your turn, my turn kind of offense and when it works, it's great. I'll throw it back to something Brad hammered home in our NBA finals year without kyrie. Paint touches. It's something from the eye test, no numbers to prove, to me that has decreased a by some amount. We worked hard that year to get it to Horford inside so we can get the ball outside more. And that has gone down as the Jays have gotten more involved with the offense. We still do run some cool stuff to run those kind of looks with Al now and at times with Rob Williams last season. We couldn't with Tristan Thompson with his stone hands and not as much with Kanter due to him being better off trying to score when he gets the ball. We can't really do that with Grant Williams because when he's at center, he's not in the pain often, as we play a 5 out of sorts. And when Tatum posts up, he's looking for one thing only and it's not to pass it out. We can definitely get better with that with our current personnel and we should but there needs to be gradual changes in that too.  3. Personnel. He's not always the problem. And its absolutely too soon to dislike it. Watching Josh Richardson has been pain so far. Some more Nesmith would be nice but I imagine he's not playing a lot for a reason. I'll choose to believe in Ime for now. We haven't had an out and out shooter for a while. None comes to mind. Could've been Tyler herro but Miami got to him in the draft first. And he's since shown to be more than that anyways. Wasn't Carson Edwards. Isn't Nesmith quite yet. So the who are they passing to criticism is fair, but obviously if trying to be solo offense isn't working and is costing us wins, then fucking pass even if they suck.   We suck at rebounding this season so far. Getting progressively worse every year. 21st in the league this season, 14th last season, 11th and 10th the 2 seasons before that.  Etc. Could go on. Don't want to be too much of a downer.   TL:DR Basically, things could be better. Smart isn't only frustrated about this game only and he isn't necessarily wrong either. And it isn't solely the Jays at fault. But it's fixable, and hopefully will be asap. I would rather be celebrate than bitching."
"Could be worse, you could be the Celtics.  Lorded over us the first round pick we traded away eons ago for Jeff Green. Finally conveys at 14. Not a great pick, but you can get value. Grizzlies sit with no FRP.  Draft comes and they draft Aaron Nesmith at 14, projected elite shooter. But they have 2 more firsts and a full roster. Pick up Pritchard at 26.  30 rolls around and no way are they bringing in 3 rookies. So the Grizz send over two whatever future second round picks and jump in to nab Bane.  As we sit now Bane has proven to be an elite shooter, is already contributing to winning, and he is still getting better. Pritchard has proven to be a serviceable point guard, but isn't able to carve out a role for Boston. And Nesmith hasn't hit a shot this year and might not be on the roster next year.  Hate to be petty, but years of Boston fans gloating about how Ainge ""fleeced"" us lets me sleep well at night."
