Kapono was also a pretty well paid free agent for the Raptors at the time and almost travelled every other possession. He had more size and could get his shot off a bit better but I think that's it. Both are pretty meh at the end of the day though.  Hopefully I don't get lynched by the Matt Thomas fan club for saying that....
Unpopular opinion with young Raptors fans but Kapona was better than Matt Thomas and that's not really a compliment to both. Kapono was 2x 3pt champ and I loved him too at the time. Kind of like how I was overly excited for 2004 dunk contest winner Fred Joned when we signed him
"Warriors yall need a center, how we give you Chris Boucher and 2 of our players let's say TD2 and Matt Thomas for that minny 1st rd pick?"
"Fred VanVleet, Matt Thomas and me combined for 11 threes and 54 points"
Fred VanVleet and Matt Thomas combined for 11 threes and 54 points
"Matt Thomas got so many minutes last year, but is on the verge of getting released now"
"It finally feels like we have a solid core developing. With everyone healthy, we have Powell, Boucher and Watanabe all coming off the bench, and that still leaves Johnson and Bembry back there, plus our boy Matt Thomas even deeper back there. Plus I'm seeing a lot of great chemistry developing within certain lineups that Nurse has put out there."
There is a minimum required for official stats.  Matt Thomas officially doesn’t lead anything until he’s shot more.
Matt Thomas has shot 16 3s this year
Matt Thomas shooting 56%.....do your homework
People wonder why Matt Thomas doesn’t play lmao. He fucks the team over every defensive possession
\*Notices we're down ten  \*Checks the box score  \*Matt Thomas has played seven minutes  Makes sense we're down...
MATT THOMAS SIGHTING
Also Matt Thomas
Siakam or Matt thomas
Matt Thomas.
Odds of a Matt Thomas sighting?
&gt;	the best nba player  &gt;	Like Felicio or Matt Thomas   Top two MVP candidates for sure
Stanley Johnson &amp; Matt Thomas
U ever seen Matt Thomas at his best? The guy is a killer and can create his own shot a heck of a lot better than OG right now
OG anunoby with Matt Thomas shooting and offense
"This game should be ""heat defeat themselves"" they were so bad - what was going on?  Heat too many injuries i guess  I think box score is incorrect i swear I saw Matt Thomas drain a 3 in garbage time"
I'm sad that Matt Thomas only got to go onto the court for garbage time
"Not really. Nephews in our sub keep pretending like Matt Thomas is Steph Curry and Malachi Flynn is Trae Young and Nurse is throwing games by not putting them in, but the reality is that this roster just has very little to actually work with."
Is that....MATT THOMAS?????
MATT THOMAS SIGHTING
Can I interest you in one slightly used Matt Thomas?
as great as his hustle was last year it was panful watching him fumble layups and airball threes. But man if RHJ and Matt thomas did a fusion dance they'd be a god tier 3 and d player.
Matt Thomas starting at center boys!
I love Matt Thomas but his defence is so bad [it negates any impact he has on the offensive end](https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612761/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=1).
But what about Matt Thomas :(
The trademark Matt Thomas bankshot
time to unleash the Matt Thomas / Paul Watson
TD still in instead of Matt Thomas... Smh
Matt Thomas. I love RHJ too.
"How would they have to trade all their depth? Sixers have a lot of filler contracts. A trade could be like Green, Scott, Thybulle, Ferguson and picks for Lowry and Matt Thomas"
"At this point, no one on the Raptors is that hard of a sell. It's far too early for Flynn IMO but he's definitely been overrated coming into the season. He's likely to be a serviceable backup PG. I think Matt Thomas is the most tradable young dude that the sub loves but isn't as good as they think he is."
"For sure he makes lots of mistakes, especially fouling on threes. That said, he is still a better player than Matt Thomas on both sides of the floor."
"I want him off our team so bad, homie has been getting minutes based off of “defense” over Matt Thomas but TD gives up as much as he puts up... Nurses mind"
"Starting with our guard rotation, we have way too many guards.  - Fred has his uses, but in reality he is a horrifically undersized SG and his contract could easily become an albatross that we won’t be able to move in a few years.   - I love Norm but his production is inconsistent and he has never broken his rookie habit of making boneheaded mistakes.   - TDII has good potential but he’s done stupid shit on and off the court, if we aren’t confident we can keep him under wraps he shouldn’t be off the table.   - Matt Thomas gives us a much needed scoring presence off the bench but Nurse refuses to play him because he isn’t a great defender.   - Flynn hasn’t had any where near enough time to come into his own, so I wouldn’t touch him until he’s had more time to prove himself.   - If we aren’t certain or confident Lowry re-signs with us before the end of the season, it might be a good idea to ship him out as well. I’d prefer to keep him if we can as a veteran presence to mentor our incoming talent but if it looks like he’s going to walk don’t let him go for free.   Look around to see if anyone bites, prioritizing first round picks and young talent.   Next, our wings.   - Siakam has his uses, but he is never going to be what we need as a #1 option and I am worried that the more we try to force him into that role the more he’ll lose confidence in himself.   - OG has hit his ceiling as far as I am concerned, he is what he is and I don’t think we can expect any huge leap at this point in his career.   I wouldn’t try to trade either of them, if anything I’d look into bolstering our forward depth instead of our guard depth.   As for centres:  - Baynes is 100% washed, bite the bullet on his contract and do not re-sign him when it expires. (I don’t think any team would want him as he is, his contract may as well be considered immovable)  - Boucher has been spectacular, but he is way too light to compete with any of the elite bigs in this league, I’d consider playing him as a forward instead.   Even if we completely blew up our roster, I still think we’d be in a better position than where we were when Masai took control in 2013.   The NBA, as a league, is driven by elite individual talent, and that is what we are sorely missing.   We are a roster of supporting players, there aren’t any top-tier players hitting the market any time soon, and it’s a pretty safe bet that none of them are coming to us in free agency.   Our greatest strength in Masai’s tenure has been our drafting, we need to capitalize on that and look to the future.   I would be totally fine with my team proving me wrong and making me look like a twat for posting this, but I don’t see it happening.  Sorry for the novel."
"Matt Thomas sucks, Mr. 99% of the time in the wrong spot on defense"
I was told Matt Thomas was this year's spiciest 905 dish.
"He's the reverse Matt Thomas.     Decent defence, but he put up 3 pts, 0 assists, and 0 offensive rebounds in 15 minutes tonight. Dude is an absolute non-entity on the opponent's half.     If we could somehow combine them, we'd have a borderline all star, but as it stands, they are both thoroughly mediocre."
"Or Matt Thomas, who I'm increasingly convinced must have slept with Nick Nurse's wife or something."
"Oh my god, NICK! TEAM CAN'T DRAIN A SHOT TO SAVE THEIR LIVES RIGHT NOW. MATT THOMAS IS RIGHT THERE. USE HIM!"
please gimme some Matt Thomas babyyyyy
"One thing to consider. A third team will have to be involved to take on some of those salaries. Raptors arent making a trade that requires them waiving guys since we'd rather train/develop guys like Yuta and Matt Thomas, than take on Danny Green and Mike Scott."
"1. We've blown a lot of double-digit leads.  2. At the start of the season Siakam struggled a lot.  He's playing way better now, and although it hasn't translated to wins, the team (at least the starting lineup) is looking better.  3. We have big problems at centre.  Ibaka and Gasol left which has had a huge impact, Baynes and Len have been hot garbage and borderline unplayable, Chris Boucher has been very good but he isn't really a true 5.  4. We have no bench.  Norm Powell has struggled a lot (wild shooting splits of 43% on 3PAs and 31% on 2PAs), Boucher has been good off of the bench but if Baynes and Len are this bad then you might need to start Boucher.  Nick Nurse has Terence Davis and Matt Thomas (especially Matt Thomas) on super short leashes, I'm assuming because of defense, which means they're barely playing.  Malachi Flynn has only seen real minutes in three games, two of which he didn't do much and one which he played well.  TLDR: Stanley Johnson is getting consistent rotation minutes, which should tell you all you need to know about the Raptors rotation problems at the moment."
"That’s interesting, so technically all the European players that sign as free agents (teodosic, Matt Thomas, campazzo) have declared for the draft at some point ?"
Matt Thomas declared for the draft but didnt get picked
But don’t teams sign players from Europe all the time that don’t get drafted? For example campazzo this year and Matt Thomas for the raptors last year. Aren’t they theoretically free agents that can sign to any employer they want? I guess my question is what’s the difference between a free agent player coming out of college and a free agent player from Europe
"Raptors clearly need a C, and it's starting to look like having Terence Davis, Malachi Flynn and Matt Thomas around is a little redundant, so... what kind of a centre can one or two of them buy?"
"Kyle Lowry, Matt Thomas, McCaw for Seth Curry, Danny Green, Mike Scott, and Tyrese Maxey"
Matt Thomas mid-range shooting
* sad matt thomas noises *
CJ mucollum is so talented man he reminds me of Matt Thomas with better handles
Boucher is the new Matt Thomas
Smart I guess? We already have Duncan Robinson at home (Matt Thomas) but Nurse refuses to play him
"Matt Thomas has played 49 total minutes this season so far, and Norm has played significantly more.  Statistical comparison is meaningless.  For example, Matt Thomas has the second highest ORtg and third highest BPM on the team right now...   Just ignoring stats for a second anyway, Norm is a far better player than Matt Thomas and Norm has a history of playing for us in crunch time.  It's a no-brainer to throw in Norm at the end of the game there."
Norm is better than Matt Thomas
Matt Thomas? Who really should be playing more?
It’s an attempt to project potential on a player who is due for a minute increase.   If this was tacko fall or Matt Thomas. Then we’d know it’s not warranted.   But 30-34 minutes is reasonable for lamelo and projecting those numbers give you an idea of ceiling average numbers.
my incompetence has nothing to do with my flair.   matt thomas
Why is Matt Thomas on ice again
Throw in Matt Thomas
"I'm not saying Malachi Flynn is better than LaMelo. That would be unreasonable; borderline insane. But, Matt Thomas might be."
"Flynn is as raw or rawer than Ball, which says something about his ceiling. So far Flynn hasn’t had the same leash yet with healthy FVV/Lowry/Davis/Powell even Matt Thomas as SG. We got plenty of guards.  I’d give Flynn a year or two before comparing him to anyone. He might be more like a Curry than Lamelo."
Man these are the minutes Matt Thomas is getting? tragic
I really feel for Matt Thomas. This guy probably banged Nurse's wife
Btw this is a perfect game for Matt Thomas.
Still not sure why Matt Thomas isn't getting any minutes.
"Larry ""Matt ""Mr. 99%"" Thomas"" Nance"
"Well when the Centers above him in rotation are injured Okafor kicks ass. Dante Exum had injuries, Emmanuel Mudiay sat on Utah’s bench last year and did alright, Stanley Johnson is stealing minutes from Matt Thomas on my Raptors, Justise Winslow played like 7 games last season (I think), Dragan Bender turned out to only be a baby Dragan, Kris Dunn has a worse jumper then Stevie Wonder, Thon Maker realized he was ass and kept a connection to that by making Thongs, Skal Labissiere is still trying to learn how to spell his name, Josh Jackson’s doing alright on the Pistons this year Phoenix was pretty impatient with his effiency and consistency, Frank Ntilikina is the god and you will not besmirch his name, Dennis Smith Jr got traded to the Knicks where player development comes to die, TJ Leaf never turned over a new leaf, Dwayne Bacon burned his foot on a George Foreman grill cooking himself, Marvin Bagley gets injured more then I get rejected (a lot), Mo Bamba is hardly playing this season, Zhaire Smith is Zhaire Smith and Mo Wagner is existing"
He is not playing up to Nick's expectations so Nick doesn't give a shit. Same as Matt Thomas who could easily have won the game for us.
Might as well bring Matt Thomas in to jack up 3s
Freds our best player so far. The poverty version would be Malachi Flynn and Matt Thomas
Malachi Flynn and Matt Thomas &gt; Splash bros
FVV and Matt Thomas
"Your forgetting OG and Powel and we still have young guys like Terrance Davis, Matt Thomas and Malachai Flinn so things aren't hopeless but yea, replacing Marc and Serg with Aaron Baynes hasn't worked well for us at all. Those guys really brought some more veteran leadership and knew how to rally the troops. Now it's like the second we start get a lead we just coast until the the other team catches up and by the time we decide to start playing again it's already to late. If worst comes to worst, we tank this season, get a top ten pick (hopefully a decent center), resign Lowery to a 2 year 40-50 million dollar contract and get back to our winning ways next season when the bubble is far behind us."
"Lowry, FVV, OG, Siakam?, Boucher, and I don't even know at this point. Matt Thomas? Norm as a trade piece? Stanley fucking Johnson? We're a mess man"
"He should get used to it. Even if he turns it around he's going to be the scapegoat.  &amp;#x200B;  Pascals struggles are hiding the fact that OG isnt ready to create off the dribble and if you ask him to do much more than sit in a corner shooting 3s and defend its no bueno - but he's 23 so Raptor Nation gives him a pass. I'm predicting he'll get this year as a pass and then people will start criticizing him too (thats when he'll be the age that Pascal ascended)  &amp;#x200B;  Pascals struggles also hide that Matt Thomas has an 111 defensive rating while on the floor which is absolutely disgusting defensively. Terence Davis has a 108 defensive rating. This has allowed Stanley Johnson to play (88 DRTG). Baynes has put up zero points and Len got a few rebounds.      This team has a myriad of issues, Siakam just being the most obvious."
"Lowry going to be 35, need to rebuild sooner or later. I’ll give you FVV.   I do not support TD at all due to domestic abuse, anti masking, etc, don’t even want him on the team but you do you. But I don’t support that over any talent he has. That’s not the guy for me.   Matt Thomas is older and is a shooter, that’s his ceiling so Bagley still has way more potential. And his ceiling is much higher than Flynn, who is a 22 year old rookie. Bagley is actually younger than him too.   Yes Bagley had a rough stretch in his career, but he was genuinely a high rated prospect who is only 21. To say you want 35 year old Lowry on his last year over him is so short sighted."
I will gladly give up Bamba but I don’t know what he’s worth. A solid second.  IDK.  Matt Thomas probably is who I’d want cause he can shoot but he’s way better than Bamba.
"Lol I feel like DLo is the kid we had in a really bad relationship, I constantly forget him/keep him out of my mind. Meanwhile I’ve got scrapbooks for bi, zo, josh, svi, mo, Thomas, Matt, etc"
Matt Thomas got in work. No excuses.
Honestly that’s not a bad idea. Gonna cost them a first and Matt Thomas.
"Both teams are in the same boat at the moment.  Denver look terrible offensively without Jokic on the court. For Denver, Murray, Monte Morris and MPJ have had periods where they have been excellent.  For Denver, Gary Harris has been ok defensively but awful offensively. For Denver, Will Barton, Milsap, P.J. Dojier have oscillated from Okay to unplayable. Green has looked good in short spurts for Denver and probably deserves more minutes.  The Raptors barely look like an NBA team without Lowry. For the Raptors, Boucher &amp; Van Vleet have had periods where they have been excellent. For the Raptors, OG has been good defensively but his offense has been iffy. For the raptors, Siakam, Powell, T.D have all oscillated between okay to unplayable. For the raptors, Matt Thomas has looked good and should get more minutes, especially when the raptors has periods where they can't hit a 3 to save their lives.  But overall as things settle down, I thing the Nuggets will be fine because Jokic's facilitation has been sublime. If Gary Harris and Will Barton stop missing open shots/layups they will be fine.  Really worried about the raptors, especially, if Siakam can't get back to an all-star level"
Can we trade Siakam for Malachi Flynn and Matt Thomas?
Gimme some Matt Thomas and Treboucher plz
"TD2, Flynn, and to a lesser extent Matt Thomas. Maxey projects better than all 3, but we do have many homegrown guards."
"We need a 3 point contest of Duncan Robinson, Davis Bertans, Joe Harris, Seth Curry, Doug McDermott, Wayne Ellington, and Matt Thomas"
Imagine if we really get beat by Chris  Boucher &amp; Matt Thomas 😭
Pretty much shows our bench needs a serious retooling. Players like Matt Thomas and Paul Watson ain't cutting it.
Props to Matt Thomas for coming through in the clutch and getting us those fries.
anyone but Matt Thomas.
"Eh, we got lots of dudes to watch in the NBA (so we don't have to watch the Flyin' Pr0-16hms this year). Monte Morris, Georges Niang, THT, Matt Thomas, Abdel Nader, Haliburton. All having solid years, and all but Tyrese on good-ish teams."
"We still have Matt Thomas, detroit watch out !"
"Probably our starting lineup tbh, and expect Matt Thomas, td2, Yuta and Stanimal to get a good amount of minutes."
"Lowry/Bembry/Norm/Boucher/Baynes  TD/Matt Thomas/Stanley Johnson/Paul Watson/Donte Hall  Strong lineup, Raps win."
Atleast NBA twitter can now shut up about Matt Thomas not playing
Matt Thomas
"Not racial, but fans chanted cancer re: Derek Fisher's daughter after he left the Jazz to go back to LA to be closer to his family.   Jason Richardson, Etan Thomas, Ronnie Price (who played in Utah), Kenyon Martin, Matt Barnes all players who have all claimed to have heard stuff.  Every fanbase has bad eggs, but it seems like the issue of racism is more common in Utah."
[What Matt Thomas will look like holding up the Ipad as Nurse cusses out the refs](https://images.app.goo.gl/Ys5c5qyPQZiBtUi19)
The subs absolute throbbing boner for Matt Thomas is getting old lol They act like we have the white Steph Curry rotting away on the bench and he is our saviour. He really provides very little at this point.
You should visit r/torontoraptors some time then. Click the Matt Thomas or Patrick McCaw threads for maximum Nurse hate.
The Matt Thomas stuff are those bandwagons who feel edgy rooting for some ‘underrated’ player
Wait matt Thomas is 6'4 o.o nooo way
"Underrated: Terence Davis, mostly because people don't like him on a personal level + his mistakes are more apparent  Overrated: Matt Thomas. Just not a good player whatsoever and our fanbase acts like we're benching some elite player for no reason"
"Watching Matt Thomas infuriates me so I've turned into a huge hater. The guy is in there to solely shoot 3s, but won't shoot them unless he is wide open. He doesn't even seem prepared to shoot before a pass gets to him which is one of the reasons he won't shoot.   On D he's just running around getting lost. People act like it's a size problem, but he's 6'4 which makes him one of our taller guards."
"Overrated is Matt Thomas. Some of our fans don't understand why he can't just do what guys like Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry, JJ Redick or prime Kyle Korver can do. They act like he is the most lethal 3pt threat in the league, he just doesn't get opportunities to play and there's nothing else off about his game.   Underrated is DeAndre Bembry. He's been very good for us as a secondary ball handler, fast break finisher, and defender. He's pretty versatile out there always getting into passing lanes and making it more difficult for guys to get their shots off."
"put Yuta on Nick, Matt Thomas ain't doing it"
"Matt Thomas needs to be released immediately.  I love the guy, but he has no defense and wont shoot the ball when it comes to him."
lol dayum dunno what i was feeling when I saw Matt Thomas switched on Embiid like that lol
"Lowry, Flynn, Matt Thomas and some picks for Simmons and Embiid who says no?"
"Nurse and Masai could definitely build a contender with no blue chip names or prospects. Nurse could surround Embiid with Fred, Matt Thomas, Stanley Johnson, and Yuta and put together a good product on the floor"
Someone gets Matt Thomas and McCaw
"Raptor fans want to trade Lowry for anything, even a 7th SG for our roster while sitting here all season complaining that Matt Thomas doesn't get minutes.     To avoid losing him for ""nothing"" but honestly, if you make this trade you're telling Norm he isn't being extended and you're going to lose him for nothing so we would probably have to follow up by trading Norman Powell elsewhere.     Then you just lost Kyle Lowry and Norman Powell for Tyrone Maxey.     Doubtful."
This is as bad as the shit trades they're saying we'd take for Lowry. They don't want Powell and Baynes.     They want one of Terence Davis/Matt Thomas/Malachi Flynn and one of Matisse Thybulle or Tyrone Maxey. They also want a FRP or potentially two FRP's. Maybe even a second. Maybe even a swap.
"Raptors would have Norman Powell, Danny Green, Patrick McCaw, Terence Davis, Tyrese Maxey, Matt Thomas, and Malachi Flynn, and Jalen Harris all vying for minutes at the 2."
"Not seeing it.     We already have FVV/Norm Powell/Matt Flynn/Matt Thomas     you sayin we gonna add Danny Green, and Maxey to our two guard rotation but still manage to leave a giant donut at C? Then we add Mike Scott to play behind Boucher who is already our second string 4?"
Maxey/Thybulle/Matt Thomas or Terence Davis/FRP/SRP/ wouldn't be massive? That's like 4 prospects breh how many prospects do you need
I had Raptors fans downvoting me for saying they’d be better if they replaced Van Vleet with Trae then one guy said Trae wouldn’t get minutes in the Raptors system and that he’s worse than Matt Thomas
"Albeit in limited playing time, Matt Thomas is 14/38 (36.8%) from the field and 10/28 (35.7%) from 3. And his defensive liabilities are plain.  There's a reason he's getting less time. No one doubts he has a flame-thrower, and there is value in that, AND I would believe he will improve his % by the end of the season, but in about 1/3 the attempts as last year, he's down **12%** in 3PT% overall."
"Would you take Norman Powell, Lowry, Matt Thomas and our frp plus a future second for Vuce and Fournier?  Norm needs to start somewhere to be the highly efficient scoring guard he has been and Lowry can’t come off the bench when he’s back. Norm can be the go to Magic guard scorer (been killing it for us the last 2 weeks again), Lowry is expiring and can provide cap flexibility to be a team that can take contract dumps for picks like OKC has done. Matt Thomas is an excellent shooter to boost the offense too  If anything a 3 team trade can be done to get Lowry somewhere that can win though"
I’m not one of those people calling for more Matt Thomas playing time LOL. I know it’s because we can’t hide his defence anymore - losing Marc and Ibaka hurt Thomas the most
Are you saying he isn’t a bad coach because Matt Thomas isn’t in the rotation?? Go figure
I've never seen anyone look more like a spot up shooter than Matt Thomas
TDII is earning his minutes right now. I never want to see Matt Thomas again
We’re gonna need TD or Matt Thomas to come in hot
"not before you trade Tatum for Matt Thomas, you really need to get that locker room cancer out of there, he basically made Kyrie leave you guys"
lol Matt Thomas that pass
That doesn't tell you anything. It tells you the coach favours defense over offense. Lol the same reason we don't fucking play Matt Thomas. Stop hating.
 Matt Thomas
Matt Thomas looks like the dude hitting arms 3x a week at my college gym
Matt Thomas playing real minutes and the Raptors beating the Bucks back to back just like we all expected
I can't believe he didn't call for a screen and try to get the switch on Matt Thomas standing in the corner.
Matt Thomas is on the team. He doesnt get called up.
Malachi Flynn called up to play? Am I seeing this properly  edit: and matt thomas? holy shiznits!
Matt Thomas is white.
"If you have 2 seven footers, siakam and bembry it’s impossible for Matt Thomas to be a defensive liability"
Matt Thomas lowkey ass ngl
"I see that that a lot with Matt Thomas and my bball friends and you have to remind them that he is 6'5"" and absolutely shredded."
I assume Matt Thomas is going too
Matt Thomas is our walmart DRob
"So norm, Matt thomas, Baynes and Stanley Johnson would make the numbers work. But why toronto would do that i don’t know"
shoutout to the raptors for picking him up for 2 2nd rounders aron baynes and norman powell and probably matt thomas to make salary match and then they waive poor matt thomas
"Nance, Hart, Zu, Svi, Clarkson. Anyone with a pulse knew they could play while they were on the Lakers. You can throw in Wagner as well. That's just the players who left. We also found Nwaba, who is on the Rockets and Matt Thomas on the Raps."
"They also listed Duncan as a C during our Beautiful Game years when he was definitely our PF when starting alongside Splitter (he would slot up to C when Diaw was in, but Diaw didn’t start for us until the Finals). It contributes to the notion that Duncan was a C after Robinson retired even though he played alongside guys like Rasho Nesterovic, Nazr Mohammed, Fabricio Oberto, Francisco Elson, Kurt Thomas, and Splitter after Robinson retired.   The only two players he started alongside post-03 that would have him definitively play as the team’s center were DeJuan Blair, Matt Bonner and LaMarcus Aldridge."
Our sub was calling flynn a god before he got sent to 905. Our sub thinks Matt Thomas is the solution to our problems. Our sub thinks james harden would be a bad fucking trade. Please
simmons and embiid for lowry and matt thomas LFG
dude matt thomas was literally an all star but nurse just had a personal vendetta against him 🙄
Do they have Matt Thomas in this scenario?
"MJ, easy. He’d say some shit that cut so deep Matt Thomas would shatter."
"Put Matt Thomas in, you coward."

Why the fuck is Matt Thomas getting mentions by a non-raptor or Jazz fan on r/nba?
Gotta be jordan ... he beat Michael Kidd Gilchrist not too long ago. Matt Thomas is a much worse player
Disrespectful to Matt Thomas...

Matt Thomas is going to drop a 30 piece in the second half

Yes if its Matt Thomas
Forget drafting. What about undrafted? Caruso and Matt Thomas (Jazz) were both on that GOAT summer league team with Lonzo and Kuzma that won it all. Nwaba on the Rockets was originally from us as well.
"I mean, I'm not a collosal fucking moron so I'd be hype as hell that we got Blake Griffin off the buyout market for the vet min.  We are paying a guy named Matt Thomas more than you are paying Blake. Matt Thomas averages 7 minutes and 2 points a game. We also pay more to Illyasova, who has played 3.7 minutes a game and was waived by two teams and traded for a 2nd round pick.  Blake Griffin, even playing like he did in Detroit, is a dozen times more playable than the player you typically get on a vet min deal. Blake is the 38th lowest paid player in the entire league, meaning that he's paid less than all first round and most second round draft picks from last year.  A vet min guy averaging 9/3 isn't bad, that's a fucking ridiculous success. A team that was 50 million dollars over the cap managed to sign two solid role players. Are you actually too dumb to realise how insane and ridiculous that is? I don't think any team ever has had that happen. Like, people laughed in the face of a Lakers content creator who said that they might get Blake in a vet min deal this year. Dwight was considered a ridiculously cheap pickup for a washed up player and he got paid twice what Blake does and signed in free agency with a team that had cap room."
Will Matt Thomas score tonight?
"Team record does not mean you are the best team, the most likely to win a title, or the most talented...the Lakers had the 3rd best record last season.  Utah largely stood pat, outside of nabbing Matt Thomas in a trade.  Reports said they felt their roster was fine, and weren't looking to rock the boat.  Philly went out and got Hill in a trade.  The Suns are paper tigers tbh.  They got clapped by a Harden and the bench but you expect NBA players to pick them over playing with Harden, Kyrie, and KD?  One team, missing KD for most of the season, is only half a game back of the other team....which do you think NBA players will perceive as better?"
"The plan is to tank the season and in the offseason we now have a lottery pick, Boucher and two good seconds we got from trading Terence Davis and Matt Thomas. We can make moves to move up in the draft or even trade those picks for a win now player depending on where our pick lands.   From there we can resign Lowry and try to actually compete next year. The Raptors were near the top of the East last year and were a quarter away from being the ones to face Miami with the same roster + Marc and Serge. People calling for a rebuild aren’t looking at the fact we already signed our core 3. A complete rebuild makes little sense and we aren’t so bad that keeping Lowry and trying again for the next two years doesn’t make any sense"
"I think the actual plan is to tank the season and either use the pick (which will definitely be in the lottery, just how low is another story) or trade it for a win now player. We also have the good seconds we got for TD and Matt Thomas  This is a lost season because of Tampa and the glaring lack of a centre. The fact the FO hasn’t rectified it should tell you everything about what they think about this season.  Lowry can sign over the cap after we make possible moves or just draft and then we compete. The Raptors were near the top of the east last year with this same roster + Marc and Serge, it’s not rebuild time"
"And Zu, Thomas Bryant, Svi... I think the only pick they had that was out of the league before the end of their rookie contract was Anthony Brown lol. Even Matt Thomas is getting burn and he came up on their G-League team. Absolutely bonkers."
1. Rudy Gobert  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Mike Conley  4. Joe Ingles  5. Jordan Clarkson  6. Bojan Bogdanovic  7. Royce O'neale  8. Georges Niang  9. Miye Oni  10. Matt Thomas or Ersan Ilyasova?
Matt Thomas looks like a midget 20-year-old Joe Ingles with a nice tan
"Good players like Stanley Johnson, Aron Baynes, Matt Thomas and Paul Watson?  You drop him into any bottom dwelling team and he'd look like freaking Bradley Beal."
matt thomas
When Matt Thomas gets twenty minutes of playing time you know you're royally fucked.
Matt Thomas and maybe a 2nd for Hassan whiteside
Hawks injuries aren’t as meaningful when they’re not comparable players  Matt Thomas and Terence Davis are not saving the day for us
"Could add like Matt Thomas or Paul Watson so it's 4 for 2, then cut someone from the roster"
How much help does Matt Thomas need
Matt Thomas wasnt much better and they were on the court at the same damn time!
Man Matt Thomas has been soooo underwhelming
"Tbh we’ve been playing trent forrest and matt thomas in the 4th quarter, i’m not too worried"
Matt Thomas and Forrest getting a lot of minutes in the 4th…
matt thomas in utah for one reason
"I've watched his games since the beginning, and I even remember the Duncan SF Will Perdue PF Robinson C Triple-Tower games.  Gotta note that Tim generally played a lot more minutes than those guys. A lot of times those guys would go to the bench, and then Tim would move to C as somebody like Malik Rose, Kurt Thomas, or Matt Bonner would come into the game and play PF. Also, a lot of times they'd list Duncan as the PF and somebody else as the C, even if that dude was smaller than Duncan and/or was really playing the PF role (e.g. Boris Diaw or Dejuan Blair).  I think he's got a case to be considered the best PF and second-best C of all-time (I think he at least has an argument to be ahead of the other guys I mentioned, except Kareem)."
Good for him.   Also glad its not on our team anymore lol he was easily the worst defensive player on our team next to Matt Thomas
Matt Thomas. I believe in Mr 99%.
"Post the game transcript and I’ll highlight the garbage, including the low blow about Matt Thomas as he was shooting free throws."
Matt Thomas will save us?
completely forgot Matt Thomas was on the Jazz
Fair enough lol. If we had Matt Thomas he'd be a prime candidate
"so are the jazz technically, however long ago we signed matt thomas and ersan ilyasova"
Matt Thomas
"I agree.  Also I guess Matt Thomas is technically a second year player even though we got him at this season’s trade deadline. He DEFINITELY had a rough start when he first got here and still couldn’t guard a semi truck, but he’s starting to earn minutes and has gotten a consistent jumpshot."
Lmaoooooo  Throw Matt Thomas in there
Nice to see Matt Thomas and Joe Ingles spending some quality father-son time together.
Matt Thomas and Christopher “Drama” Pfaff
"I doubt it. We only have three guards on our rotation that are NBA level players, and two of them are injured. Replacing Mitchell's production is hard enough; replacing it with Trent Forrest and Matt Thomas is laughable."
🚨🚨🚨 MATT THOMAS IS IN 🚨🚨🚨
time to play matt thomas the rest of the game
"Had Toronto known they were going to be able to keep FVV, but lost Serge and Marc, I think that we would’ve gone for a big in the draft instead of 2 guards (this was also when Terence Davis and Matt Thomas still looked promising and we had Norm still)"
Matt Thomas goes for the jugular
Matt Thomas is a streaky shooter. with awful defense lol.
"Hopefully Conley is playing, it will be a great game if he is, I don't think the Jazz have a chance without him.  Unless Matt Thomas goes nuclear again."
Matt Thomas was a beast last year
Sounds like it's probably Matt Thomas
"Don't forget Boris Diaw, current Nets GM Sean Marks, Grant Hill, Matt Barnes, Robin Lopez, Goran Dragic, Jared Dudley, Channing Frye, James Jones, Jalen Rose, Kurt Thomas etc.   Those Suns teams had role players for days."
Put Matt Thomas in more 😤😤😤 7/7 in 9 minutes for 17 points
"&gt; Matt Thomas  ""Mattt"" Thomas"
Matt Thomas doesn't miss.
I miss matt Thomas
WTF Matt Thomas 7/7 in less than 10 minutes? Were they counting his layup lines or something?
Who the fuck is Matt Thomas?!?
It’s fine. Just replace Don with Matt Thomas. 100% win
Matt Thomas makes the cut
"matt thomas, r/torontoraptors golden child"
"Yeah, but Seth is an NBA player lmao, what happened here is different, God bless Matt Thomas though I’m sure he hustled his heart out tonight"
Matt Thomas needs like 4 layups to calibrate his 3 point shot.
I didn't watch this game but I can only assume the Matt Thomas/Terence Davis matchup was legendary.
matt thomas &lt;3
Matt Thomas is my new celebrity crush ❤️
Bro Matt Thomas is my new celebrity crush ❤️
Matt Thomas showing why he's the 2nd best Cyclone in the league
Matt Thomas in shambles
lol he called him matt thomas again
Called Flynn Matt Thomas twice lmaooo
You guys are sleeping on the deep bench dudes. OP is asking because he’s seen Matt Thomas on Utah’s deep bench and the dude is a turnstile
Why is Matt Thomas allowed to take long twos?
Matt Thomas to the Utah Jazz
Time for our favorite game: Will Matt Thomas actually make a 3?
- Michael Jordan and Isiah Thomas  - Matt Barnes and Derek Fisher  - Reggie Miller and Spike Lee
"Your favorite bubble vloggers favorite bubble vlogger, I'll never forget when Oshae documented Matt Thomas talking like a real Toronto mans or FVV telling him to ""get me my fucking food""."
"for real lol, they were hyping Terrance Davis and Matt Thomas like mad and then both got traded..."
"Matt ""Jimmer Fredette"" Thomas"
Will Matt Thomas make a shot or continue to be a dud?
Matt Thomas
tbh i wouldn't be mad if we never play matt thomas again
Matt Thomas is literally useless
"Matt Thomas needed all these qualifiers to be Mr. 99 - eFG, unguarded, etc.  Ersan Ilyasova doesn't fuck with that to be Mr. 100 - true FG, guarded or not"
TIL matt Thomas is on the jazz now
Flynn has been balling for us. Getting rid of TD and Matt Thomas’ minutes has benefited him greatly and he’s been thriving as a starter in these past few games.
"Utah fans: How is Matt Thomas doing, is he getting more minutes?"
"He's said ""I want to win a championship in Utah"" about a dozen times. Doesn't mean he won't in the future if things go south, but he wants to stay here in the meantime.  That's why I'm confused with this tweet. Like, yeah the Jazz should've tried to trade for LeBron instead of signing Matt Thomas.   Obviously nowhere near the same caliber of players involved, but the Jazz aren't trading Gobert unless they're going full rebuild."
He hasn't been landing shots since last season get baited by sleeper agent Matt Thomas
"Matt Thomas Tonight: 5/3/0 on 2-10 Shooting, 1-8 from 3 pt in 15 minutes"
"Yeah agreed, while the Sixers could have used Lowry the required price due to salary matching and assets was STEEP. And arguably would have left the Sixers in a more of a risky place.   To get Lowry they would have needed to trade Danny Green, and let’s assume the Raptors would take Maxey and not Thybulle. Sixers would still need to add 8m worth of salary, which means trading Mike Scott AND 2/3 of Korkmaz, Dwight Howard, &amp; Shake Milton. Which cuts into their already not exceptionally deep rotation. And then asking for a FRP plus another second? That’s an absurd price to pay and leaves your roster extremely vulnerable to injuries come playoff time.   Asking for picks and a young player is a fair price for Lowry, but in the Sixers case the salary matching requirements would have cut too deep into their rotation IMO to be worth it. And might have harmed them as much as Lowry could have helped them come playoff time. Not to mention the commitment of future money to an older player required with Lowry, the loss of picks that could replenish that depleted bench roster, &amp; the issue of roster space for the Raptors (even losing TD2 and Matt Thomas would Have left us needing one more roster spot).  Deal would have been tough, and might not have helped the Sixers as much as originally hoped."
Hey! Rare Matt Thomas sighting!
"Matt Thomas, I miss you mr 99%"
Hubie Brown’s voting in Matt Thomas for Finals MVP
Even raptors fans nephews were questioning Nurse for not playing Matt Thomas. Clowns
"Matt ""99%"" thomas"
Utah needs to FREE MATT THOMAS
"Well the bench looks much better overall when Ingles is part of that and Conley starts. Clarkson and Ingles are obviously very good, Niang and Favors are fine but not amazing. Past that it's pretty bad so I another guard off the bench would be great. I'd love to see Forrest or Oni step up and fill that role, but that's never a guarantee. Guys like Matt Thomas amd Ilyosova feel like they could be useful with their shooting but maybe just aren't settled into the system to be getting playoff minutes."
#Put Matt Thomas in!
"The Jazz likely protect Mitchell, Gobert, Bogdanovic, O'Neale, Clarkson, Ingles, Favors, and Oni. Niang and Conley aren't under contract next year.  Trent Forrest has played the most minutes outside of those named. Matt Thomas is probably the best bet. Elijah Hughes has huge potential but has barely played and was hurt for part of the season, same with Azubuike."
"Because every member of our 9-man rotation who isn't a center is a great shooter. Clarkson is the only guy who is not close to a 40% shooter, but he is a much better scorer overall, better ball handler, etc. Matt Thomas is much worse defensively and doesn't really do anything other than shoot, which is something our roster has in spades."
Jazz need to bring Matt Thomas in for some instant offense
Wait since when Matt Thomas went to Jazz?

Or the LeBron-Matt Thomas streak if the Jazz make the finals.
"Monte Morris, Georges Niang, Matt Thomas, Abdel Nader, Talen Horten Tucker and Tyrese Haliburton."
"When they're all together on the court, they're bad (and that's also because the offense is ran then by a 2nd rd rookie PG who has no reliable outside shot). When one or two of them are playing with 2nd or 1st unit, a few of them look decent. Oni has shown most flashes, Morgan and Brantley could be serviceable in short bursts (although I expected more from Morgan this season after last year's bubble play), I have minimal hope for Forrest progressing into aything more than a 3rd string borderline NBA/G-league point guard.  I really don't see Niang-like story happening with Matt Thomas and I have no clue what to think of Elijah Hughes and Dok in the next two seasons. Dok could be a great 3rd C in short bursts, I feel."
Play Matt Thomas you cowards
Utah could close this out easy if they put in Matt Thomas
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
Elite shooters are a different story.. the cheap shooters I’m referring to are like Matt Thomas lol
"He'll be an UFA so if they had no intention to re-sign him, might as well get something in return. Same thing for Matt Thomas.  They have FVV and Gary Trent Jr as their guards of the future and two promising rookies in Malachi Flynn and Jalen Harris, two players who will be cheaper. They also have Paul Watson.   Overall the Raptors made 3 good trades at the deadline. We'll see what the Kings do with Davis, but if they end up re-signing him without overpaying him it'll be a good trade for them too.   My nomination for the worst trade of recent years is the Lakers trading Zubac for Muscala. Just, why?"
"Like I fuckkng said jackass he’s terrific when you have someone else running the offense. But he’s also very one dimensional. I’ve watched AC since fucking summer league when we ran him with Zo, Matt Thomas, Kuz and Zublocka. He’s not elite defensively,...very good yes, elite no. Not bad he proven he can even start a full season. Not a shot creator, not that good creating for others in the half court, has been very up and down as a shooter. Despite hitting 40% he doesn’t create the kind of gravity you would expect because he can’t come off of screen or pin downs.   He absolutely has struggled against sg’s in the past defensively, and he doesn’t create much offense for himself “though I will credit him his last year on a two way contract he really showed me more than I expected offensively for like 10 games or so at the end of the season when we were already eliminated from postseason. And he’s had a few good games this year like that such   Caruso hits at 40%, but like I’ve said over and over, he is hesitant to take the shot. For all the open looks he receives only take 2 triples a game is low. Ac is an absolutely terrific role player and I have never fuckkng denied that. But I’m not paying a guy like Caruso anything over ten million if I don’t have a star player do I sting the ball in the half court allowing him to simply defend and catch and shoot. Like I said from the fucking start!!! He’s worth 12 for the lakers and a few other teams. But he is absolutely not a 12 million dollar player in the grand scheme of things.   How many times have we seen overachievers get paid and then struggle outside of the systems that made them look like studs. I guess you would say he’s as good as Marcus smart? Or a Josh richardson,....or anywhere near as good as a Christian wood who only makes 14. Think about this. Caruso is extremely similar to dellavadova in cleveland with bron. Top level d, huh iq, limited skill level, good shooting percentages on lower volume. I’m not paying that kind of money to AC fresh when I gotta still pay THT, Drummond (perhaps even tho he kinda sucks), Dennis, and possibly McLemore. 12 million is just too high for a type of player you can get for cheaper out of a vet."
Almost getting laid out by Matt Thomas was a great coda to this symphony
"His stats are definitely boosted by the volume. For a singular shot, I would take Matt Thomas or Duncan Robinson over Klay"
"We actually made out with 2 second round picks from that draft, not from trading Dewan but from trading our undrafteds Terence Davis (fuck that guy) and Matt Thomas"
"Matt Thomas and Terrence Davis for the Raptors this last season.  Actually, Thomas was just ass overall."
The Matt Thomas special
"Jimmer is like a worser version of Matt Thomas when he plays in the NBA and that's saying a lot.  Even if he puts up 20 on offense, the guy he's guarding is going to put up 80 on him."
Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
"I like that the first two didn’t confuse you, it was the cum filled sock looking mother fucker. On that note, it’s Matt Thomas."
I was not impressed at any moment while watching Matt Thomas this season
"I'm posting this everywhere but I was fucking killed for suggesting Lowry, Powell, Matt Thomas, 2022 1st for Simmons and dead money earlier this year.  Philly is comfortably in the finals this year, with a far more flexible off season coming up, if that pipe dream had come true."
"Earlier in the season I proposed Lowry, Powell, Matt Thomas, 2022 1st for Ben Simmons + dead money. Would have instantly fixed all Phillies spacing and shooting issues and you could have maximized a year of Embiids prime.  I was brutalized for it at the time. I wonder how many 76ers fans would take that deal in hindsight now?"
"Jazz definitely didn't know how to stop the bleeding. Ty Lue ran circles around Quin, but in fairness there's only so much you can do with a roster that has such awful perimeter defenders and no depth outside of Ingles and Clarkson. Jazz front office deserves to take a lot of heat for drafting a center when they just signed Favors instead of a wing which they desperately needed, then doing nothing at the deadline except for acquiring a bench warmer in Matt Thomas and Ersan Ilyasova."
Matt Thomas was in this postseason!
Raptors' top 15 players not in this postseason:  |1|Pascal Siakam| --:|:--| |2|Fred VanVleet| |3|Norman Powell| |4|Kyle Lowry| |5|OG Anunoby| |6|Chris Boucher| |7|Malachi Flynn| |8|Terence Davis| |9|Aron Baynes| |10|DeAndre' Bembry| |11|Freddie Gillespie| |12|Stanley Johnson| |13|Yuta Watanabe| |14|Paul Watson| |15|Matt Thomas|
"25% Quin for not trying something else, 75% front office for not getting Quin the right kinds of pieces to try something else with.  Torrey Craig was available for cash. Instead, the Jazz got... Matt Thomas??"
lmfao. release matt thomas now
Its time to unleash MATT THOMAS
"Patrick McCaw, Matt Thomas, Kostas Antetokounmpo, Alen Smailagić, and Andre Drummond"
"Melo was an honorable mention all-american, 1st team all-B1G, and the best player on a Sweet 16 team.  Dylan Ennis averaged 11/4/3 and was a starter for a Final 4 team.  Booker was 2nd team all-pac 12.  Matt Thomas played the past 2 years in the NBA  You're talking like these guys were benchwarmers in the Sun Belt Conference and then started lighting it up in Europe out of nowhere or something. If anything you're only proving my point that you need to be pretty fucking good in college to have a chance to play professionally anywhere. These guys are not indicative of the average talent level in college. They're the 2nd tier, being guys that are good enough to play professionally but not quite good enough for the NBA. The high-end talent in the NCAA is on par with or better with the best talent in Europe but top-to-bottom the average talent in any professional league is better. Even the guys that you listed all were major conference players, who were at the very least starters who averaged double figures and were contributors on winning teams. They're already well above the average NCAA player to even have the chance to play in Europe."
Matt Thomas. Give that guy minutes and trust and see what he can do.
you think people would give more of a shit about 3x3 if Matt Thomas or Stanley Johnson was on a team?  lol what?  like I'm sure even some NBA fans don't know who the fuck I just named.
pretty sure he was the worst defender on the team not named Matt Thomas
"If Matt Thomas found a spot, LiAngelo can find a spot if he keeps this up"
"I'm quite relaxed already. I doubt he will get his time at least significantly unless Nurse makes adjustments to his minutes which he might but he is also very to his ways.  When Kyle, FVV, Powell, Flynn were together he hardly played at all. I mean hardly ever. Mind you TD2 and Matt Thomas were also there but they hardly touched the floor either.   Nurse may make adjustments and he has clearly stated that he wants Flynn to develop so he may adjust the depth chart accordingly but we'll see."
They said the same thing about Matt Thomas and we got a value 2nd.
"Plus Matt Thomas and Juwan Morgan (not that they were major contributors, but roster spots)"
Remember last season at the trade deadline where we cleared a bunch of roster  space by dumping TD2 and Matt Thomas so that we’d be able to do nothing?
"Raptors are *way* too low, we’re at least 5-8. Like throughly look at the rosters of these other teams.  So many of our losses last year were on the margins and our worst players (and granted, our best) are gone  We don’t need to live through TD, Baynes or Matt Thomas minutes anymore"
"This was the only state HS tournament I got to see and this game/shot was fucking nuts. The Racine players played their asses off and shot the lights out. Sheboygan Lutheran had Sam and that PG (lefty, I think?) who were phenomenal. Matt Thomas had ridiculous shooting in his 2 games for Onalaska and Diamond Stone was a freak of a freshman. Milwaukee King did stuff too but I don’t remember much of that one"
"Things worked out so well with Matt Thomas, why not do it again?"
We just filled a Matt Thomas shaped hole in our hearts.
I was there. GOAT summer league team. Nwaba was there. Matt Thomas. Kuz. Zubac. Ingram for the first game. Zo. Some other shooter we signed for a couple of games a couple of years ago.
Matt Thomas and Wayne Ellington come on down! Dipo on a minimum maybe?  They are gonna fill out the roster with as many minimum contract shooters they can now.
Wind didn't have to do Matt Thomas so dirty
Matt Thomas ran so David Johnson could fly
Drafted their own Matt Thomas
"I think there’s something to be said about being a 6th man and how your shooting goes in 1 year of college.   Matt Thomas is a great shooter, but not the best “cold” shooter for Toronto. Norm was always better as a starter. I think some guys find their groove over time, and I think that’s especially true for defensive minded guys off the bench"
"Honestly this is probably the most success Iowa State players have had in the league ever. Monte Morris- one of the best 6th men in the league Tyrese Haliburton- ROY candidate this year, seems to be a key piece for the Kings moving forward  Georges Niang, Abdel Nader, Talen Horton-Tucker- All solid rotation players for playoff teams Plus you have guys like Matt Thomas, Naz Long, Deonte Burton, and Marial Shayok who have all had appearances on rosters for playoff teams.  Ironically, Royce White was one of the highest draft picks and he flamed out, although that obviously wasn't for on-court reasons."
Jordan Farmar  Shannon Brown  Oscar Schmidt  Dino Radja  Arvydas Sabonis  Or...  Monte Morris  Tyrese Haliburton  Matt Thomas  Abdel Nader  Georges Niang
For a while Matt Thomas was that guy in Toronto.  Yuta is gonna be the new one I imagine.
"Lol Matt Barnes isn’t anywhere near as intense as any bad boy. He’s intense for the modern era, I don’t think the intensity of the bad boys can be understated.  Also at guard, Isaiah Thomas. Mans was raw and dirty. Bench tho."
This team is much better than the 7-59 Bobcats... Edwards would carry this team to quite a few wins. I don't understand any of these comparisons.  rookie Kemba -&gt; Cole Anthony   Hendo -&gt; Dillon Brooks   Maggette -&gt; Markieff Morris   Diaw -&gt; Nic Batum (sorry too easy)   Biz -&gt; Biz (again... too easy)  DJ -&gt; Trey Burke   Higgins -&gt; whoever the worst SG in the NBA is right now   Reggie (holy shit I forgot he existed) -&gt; Denzel Valentine?   Mullens -&gt; tough one...  Kevin Love on nights when he really doesn't give a shit?   Diop -&gt; is Christiano Felicio still in the NBA?    Tyrus Thomas -&gt; Obi Toppin?    Matt Carroll -&gt; Steph Curry   Derrick Brown -&gt; Obi Toppin?   DJ White -&gt; pick a PF that's bad at everything and runs like he just shat his pants   Eddy Najera -&gt; Udonis Haslem
"We signed Alize Johnson and Stanley Johnson yesterday, bringing the guaranteed contracts to 15. We also have Matt Thomas on a non-guaranteed training camp deal. There's no more spots."
"Stanley Johnson, Matt Thomas and Alize Johnson would be a superstar"
"Lol if you think Matt Thomas is the difference maker think again. He’s a poor defender, and can’t seem to find a shot even when he’s wide open. He’s a trash player and should go back to Europe"
Matt Thomas also got picked up by the Bulls
"DeRozan, Stanley Johnson, Alize Johnson, Matt Thomas. All these former Raps is this a coincidence lmao."
"&gt; Wasn't Utah's offensive scheme essentially having a lot of great 1-on-1 players (minus Rudy)? Clarkson, Mitchell, Bogdanovic, Ingles, and the rest of the crew was really good at getting their own buckets but not the best at finding open looks via facilitation. Matt Thomas would suck in that.  lol, you need to watch more Jazz basketball.  Utah has lead the league in 3 point attempts for a few years now (not sure if they were always #1 but always at the top)  They do that by moving the ball a lot to find the open man ([aka The Blender](https://youtu.be/TRwqm1-WhFw) ), which usually results in an open 3 point shooter, it's the reason why everyone on the team outside of Rudy can shoot 3's at a high percentage. The only time they get iso heavy as at the end of games when Donovan tends to take over.  Matt couldn't even fit into that system, he was clanking wide open 3's"
"Matt Thomas, he was smart as hell, knew where to be most of the time but it just wasn’t pretty"
Y’all should figure out how to combine him with Matt Thomas
I think people like the idea of Matt Thomas more than the actual player…he’s a good shooter when he’s wide open but his release is relatively slow and he doesn’t seem to have the offensive awareness to get to his spots to get open like the elite shooters do so a lot of the time he just burns the clock
"Demar, Stanley Johnson, Matt Thomas...next up Chicago extends 2 year offer to Aron Baynes"
If they can find a way to successfully merge Matt Thomas and Stanley Johnson they’ve really got something…

"We traded him for a 2nd round pick(basically nothing). He couldn't get his shot off effectively because he's too short. Svi and Sam are 6'7"" so we're banking they'll be better effective shooters. Sam shot 40% on 3's in Europe the last couple years, so similar path to Matt Thomas"
Matt Thomas shot 45.7% for Toronto tf you mean
"Sadly, Neither was Matt Thomas"
It's a training camp battle between Sam Dekker and Svi Mykhailiuk on who gets the rights to be called the new Matt Thomas
Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk is a good pick up I’m so happy about this signing he can be like a Matt Thomas type of player for us
the new Matt Thomas
"2020 Matt Thomas, but with Norm’s case of already being on the other half of the court way offscreen by the time it’s being inbounded  Matt Thomas comp:   * willing to defend, not particularly effective  * very reliable 3pt shooter with a slow release. no TOs, assists or rebounds, just scoring"
"He spent 10% of his minutes at the 2 this past season and that was with the team being guard heavy with Lowry, FVV, GTJ, Norm, TDII, Matt Thomas, Malachi and Jalen Harris.  He can shoot, he can handle the ball OK and he can defend guards. Outside of that, what else does he need?"
put matt thomas in you cowards
Matt Thomas with size probably.
"Nah, we’d have built around Matt Thomas"
We just got one in Sam Dekker.  We had one in Matt Thomas last season (now on the Bulls)  Got both of em from Europe. There’s bare shooters over there. Better to do that than pay Shamet *this* much.
"Joining other euro legends Monte Morris, Matt Thomas and Talen Horton Tucker"
"And yet in the playoffs Milwaukee was the number one defensive team with a DRTG of 107.6 and the 11th best offensive team with an ORTG of 112.9. So yes, that's the biggest driving force for why the Bucks won, the Giannis being one of if not the best help defender which they crafted their entire defensive scheme around and supplemented with players to minimize Giannis' weaknesses namely guarding guards and smaller wings on the perimeter. Wow, it's almost like teams turn up on defense when they are in a seven-game series cause they can gameplan more, especially ones with transcendent defensive players like Giannis.  The Jazz fell off defensively, but like I pointed out before not because Gobert is a bad defender or not all he is cracked up to be but because the Jazz built their team on just funnelling drives to the middle into Gobert cause he is the best defensive big in the game right now and have a ton of guards and wings who are just bad at preventing straight-line drives or at bare minimum being enough of a deterrent so that Gobert can more easily come in to help on top of having the ballhandlers man coming up on their hip. But, as people who have some actual understanding of NBA defense especially in the playoffs have been saying for seasons now, the Jazz have overly relied on Gobert to be the end all be all of their defensive system which makes it easy to gameplan against as shown year in year out in the playoffs. Is this because of Gobert? No, because Nick Nurse and the Raptors coaching staff crafted a defensive system to hide the weakness and bouy the strengths of an even slower footed defensive-minded centre in Marc Gasol by having our guards being aggressive on screens so as to stay on the ballhandlers which allows Gasol to help and then recover, on top of drilling rotating to the open man for all our guards and wings, on top of the coaching staff minimizing minutes for players who are weaknesses on defense whether it be due to physically not being able to (Matt Thomas for example) or not being able to keep up mentally with the scheme (Terence Davis in his second season and Malachi Flynn for example), on top of the front office looking to bring in players who can actually play defense as well. If the Jazz were to not have a roster of wings and guards who are just not good defensively and just hope &amp; pray that Gobert goes Super Saiyan-jin, the Jazz's failings are on the coaching staff and front office. Cause in the regular season where their scheme works cause teams are not gameplanning every single night but rather have generalized schemes on both ends, their ""Gobert, Sink Or Swim"" defense works and has year in year out."
Jjj shot the lights out. Griz c team was rough to watch.   Stanley Johnson and Matt Thomas for the recent raptors connect
"Yes, I am against labour being exploited and sycophants making profit disproportionate to their own labour. What reasonable human isn’t?  The owners do have way more power than their employees. You think Matt Thomas can do what Simmons is doing? Players get traded against their will and waived off teams. Owners do nothing but own and sometimes pay luxury tax and securely rake in massive profits year over year."
Matt Thomas Should Be on The Bulls Main Roster.   Liangelo should be a Hornet.
Svi is like Matt Thomas and Bembry all in one package
Nah the Matt Thomas cult dwindled in the months leading up to the trade  I jumped off the hype about a week into the regular season last year
"Oh ok true, so you'd trade a phenom and first overall pick who had a great rookie season and looks on path to be great, for a guy who had 2 good games cause he can shoot threes. Why not just trade Edwards for Matt Thomas, I heard that guy is even better at threes!"
And Matt Thomas
No fanbase could ever overrate a player the way Raptors fans overrated Matt Thomas
Bulls get Bol Bol or Marvin Bagly as a Backup.  Or sign Demarcus Cousins. Also play Matt Thomas More he a real shooter. If we get a decent back up  big man we should be great. I never seen Tony Bradley play since College tho.
Serge to Chicago  * 2017-2018 Raptors with DeMar  * 2019-2020 Raptors with Stanley Johnson and Matt Thomas  * 2016-2017 Magic with Vucevic  DJJ to the Clippers  * 2016-2017 Suns with Bledsoe  * 2018-2019 Clippers with Justise Winslow  * 2020-2021 Blazers with Harry Giles
"If Nick Nurse couldn't get Matt Thomas to consistently hit 3's, no way Ben can"
Ig we’ll give you guys future mvp Matt Thomas for him since we’re feeling generous
Devon Dotson Alize Johnson Matt Thomas Mario Simonovic Troy brown jr
Wisconsin legend Matt Thomas
I’ve got a crazy one for you.  Matt Thomas from the Bulls.  Amazing three point shooter.  Never had gotten the minutes to really flex his offensive game.  If he can get passable on defense has the chance to be a Reddick / Korvee type player.
Matt Thomas sitting on Coby’s shoulders would solve a lot of your issues.
Bro when Stacey was roasting Matt Thomas for losing a foot race with deandre in garbage time I was dying
"How bout Alize Johnson, Matt Thomas, a Pizza hut coupon and 2 2nd round picks?"
Coby's first game back on limited minutes? Better feed Matt Thomas
Matt Thomas sighting?!?
MATT THOMAS SIGHTING
&gt;A lot of people can get to the point where they hit almost everything. But it won’t do any good if you can’t get away or around anyone.   Matt Thomas type beat
Yooooo Matt Thomas got minuets we love to see it
Let Steph cook Matt Thomas 1 time for the culture
"My boy Matt ""Mr. 99%"" Thomas would like a word"
Matt thomas 1st minutes of the season? congratulations Matt!
"The mid-2010s Iowa state teams were loaded in retrospect. Niang, Monte Morris, Abdul Nader, Naz Long, Matt Thomas, Deonte Burton have all been in the league. Niang and Buddy Hield were the main big 12 guys of that period who actually scared me bc of how good they were.   Interesting how the narrative at the time was my Kansas teams had the big players and ISU was the scrappy underdog when really Niang and Morris have had far better careers than Perry Ellis and Frank Mason have had. Fuckin Steve prohm"
"Low key Masai intentionally did that shit before the season. Alex Len, Baynes, Stanimal, Matt Thomas and Bembry were in the rotation"
"Nope.  A small minority are very vocal for Malachi, but he's the new Matt Thomas meme.  He'll get minutes but he's gotta prove he isn't a defensive liability. Svi got the dependable 3 and puts so much effort into defense and Dalano is a stud."
Man I miss the Niang/Ejim/Morris/Matt Thomas era. We went from winning the big 12 tournament and making sweet 16's to 0 wins in the big 12. Yikes.   Ejim winning B12 player of the year over Wiggins and Embiid is one of ISU's great victories.
"Matt Thomas is the greatest cheerleader in the NBA, change my mind."
