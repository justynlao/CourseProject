Udoka Azubuike will make sure that doesn’t happen
This shows a tougher schedule for the Jazz than the Lakers. Garbage time makes all the Jazz numbers funky.  Udoka Azubuike is -57 in 51 minutes lmao.
Human victory lap Udoka Azubuike
Then we would be playing Udoka Azubuike for at least 20 min/game and you’d dunk on us for that
umm...(looks up Jazz rookies)...Udoka Azubuike better watch out
"Hard to answer, I'll go with Udoka Azubuike"
The Doktor (Udoka Azubuike)
But who’s guarding Udoka Azubuike?
Udoka Azubuike too!
I'm very surprised that Sundiata Gaines and David Stockton both played in multiple seasons.  I guess I'm going to have to say Udoka Azubuike.
But what are your thoughts on udoka azubuike

"JJJ shrinks sometimes when it isn't going his way, and shines when he's doing well. Kid is gonna be live. I saw him play in person in the Champions Classic and he sold me, but we had Udoka Azubuike, so he kinda got dwarfed.  Izzo should have pulled him away from the bucket IMHO."
"There's a ton of untapped potential in Africa, I mean look this past years draft had 8 players of Nigerian descent:  Onyeka Okongwu (Hawks) Isaac Okoro (Cavaliers ) Precious Achiuwa (Heat) Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) Desmond Bane (Celtics) Udoka Azubuike (Jazz) Jordan Nwora (Bucks) Daniel Oturu (Timberwolves)  And that's just players of Nigerian descent, African is a big ass continent with a shitload of different people. Wise investment here for the NBA. It also makes me wonder whether they'll be investing in India as well, another place with a huge population and the potential to produce NBA players and grow the NBA's international audience"
"What you mean, Udoka Azubuike should be ROTY."
"Not really, I just wanna see our garbage time guys play more. Elijah Hughes has a wet jumper and i wanna see it splash. Also heard there was a dokter appointment tomorrow that is promising some big dunks and spicy blocks (Udoka Azubuike)"
"The 2020 NBA Draft had Onyeka Okongwu, Isaac Okoro, Precious Achiuwa, Udoka Azubuike, Zeke Nnaji, Daniel Oturu, Jordan Nwora and Desmond Bane who were either from Nigeria themselves or had a parent from Nigeria.  So not only is the top end talent promising, but they would be able to field a deep team"
Udoka Azubuike  Small PP confirmed.
PG- Derrick Favors  SG- Myles Turner  SF- Clint Capela  PF- Udoka Azubuike   C- Rudy Gobert
"&gt; Snyder joined most of the Jazz’s front office in being frustrated by the selection of Udoka Azubuike with the team’s first-round pick in 2020.   Anyone know who the Jazz wanted instead? The players picked after him were Jaden McDaniels, Malachi Flynn, &amp; Desmond Bane. Xavier Tillman in the 2nd round would have been nice next to Gobert or as a small-ball center, as well."
"Yeah it seems some players manage to get away with not fully extending their arms on the standing reach test. Pat Connaughton’s 44” vert and Miles Plumlee’s 41” vert come to mind. Both guys could jump out of the gym but had weird standing reach numbers. Udoka Azubuike last year also comes to mind.   That being said, wide shoulders or a long neck detracts from your height or wingspan impact on standing reach. There’s a solid bit of variance in height/wingspan to standing reach because of that, but massive outliers raise a red flag on the guy actually doing the standing reach test correctly.  Either way Keon is a freak athlete and probably would’ve been near the top numbers of all time even without potentially shortening his standing reach."

"Deividas Sirvydis, Ignas Brazdeikis, Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk, Anžejs Pasečņiks, Udoka Azubuike.  I would also rename the team from Hornets to Bees and move the team to the fictional city of Spelling."
Udoka Azubuike is gonna be special
"Udoka Azubuike has a lot of potential, I mean I’ve been hit and miss with my big men predictions quite a bit but I’ve been high on Giannis since 2014 and I think Dok can be Gobert’s replacement in the future"

"God I miss him at Kansas. One of my all time favorite who should have been known as maybe the best big at KU since Manning and up there with him in achievements. He did everything right. He stayed and worked his ass off to fix his body and perimeter defense and became the best big in the nation. He missed 2 tourneys from wrist injuries on separate wrists, and entered 2020 anchoring the best team(by far imo) in the nation. We made a final four in the only tourney he fully played in. That team the year before with him instead of landen Lucas in the lineup also wins it all and I feel strongly about that. Frank mason, devontae graham, josh Jackson, svi mykhailuk and udoka azubuike. God damn"
"The only names I recognize on this Jazz roster are Chealey (G-league journeyman), Justin Patton (big fall from grace), and MaCio Teague (2021 Undrafted). I've seen Malik Newman's and Jarell Martin's names before, too. However, the likelihood any of these guys end up in the G-league, let alone the NBA, is slim.  Jazz White has some of our roster guys, including Juwan Morgan (potential stretch 5 and on our main roster), Elijah Hughes (2nd round pick in 2020 and on our main roster), Jarrell Brantley (2nd round pick in 2019 and two-way last season), Udoka Azubuike (1st round pick in 2020, was our 3rd string center but got injured), and Trent Forrest (PG on a two-way with us last season). Other names I recognize include Dakota Mathias (was on the National Team practice squad) and Jawun Evans (played for Clippers a couple years ago). These guys are definitely much closer to being on rosters than the guys on Jazz White.  FYI, the Jazz White squad is playing against the Spurs summer league team now."
"Just to add:  Isaac Okoro - Cavs,  Chinezie Metu- Sac,  Chuma Okeke - Orl,  Onyeka Okongwu - Atl,  Zeke Nnaji - Denver,  Udoka Azubuike - Jazz,  Desmond Bane - Mem,  Jordan Nwora - Bucks,  Daniel Oturu - Clips  Monte Morris - Den"

"I think Snyder is secure. They just shook up the front office this off-season. Turns out there was a huge rift between the GM and Snyder to the point where they wouldn’t speak to each other at all. The GM wanted to tell Snyder how to coach and made a really dumb draft pick that everyone else in the organization disagreed with (Udoka Azubuike, a 7’ rim protecter when we really needed wing defence). The GM got canned so the organization I think effectively threw their chips all to Snyder."
"We'll take him for Udoka Azubuike, straight across."
"However, there are only two NBA players that exceed even the overweight BMI limit and lie in the obese category. The players with more than 30 body mass index are Zion Williamson and Udoka Azubuike. That's from this article:https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/john-williams-nba-player-get-suspended-overweight"
[Udoka Azubuike](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/azubuud01.html)  [2020 1st round 27th pick to the Jazz](https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-anthro/?SeasonYear=2020-21&amp;sort=STANDING_REACH&amp;dir=1)  6’10 260lbs with a 7’7 wingspan. Standing reach of 9’1 standing Max Vert of 37” and Max vert of 41”
"Sorry for some reason I thought nets were 12 ft tall. That makes sense they are 13 ft, otherwise we would see hands above the backboard frequently.d   A 36 inch standing vert especially with a 9’0 standing reach is special. Scottie Barnes max vert is 40 inches which isn’t as impressive as his standing vertical but it is still good and above average (especially for his size).   In the last 5 draft combines, there have been 6 players total with a standing vertical of more than 36 inches. Those players were Donovan Mitchell (6’1.25 H, 8’1 SR), Keon Johnson (6’3.5 height, 8’1 SR), Jericho Simms (6’9 H, 8’10 SR), Jalen Harris (6’2.75 H - 8’1.5 SR), Udoka Azubuike (6’10 H, 9’1 SR), Tyler Bey(6’6 H, 8’9.5 SR)  A 36 inch standing vertical would frequently put you at the top of your class for standing vertical and could even be the best (as it has been in multiple years). Considering that the only player in the last 5 years to measure a bigger standing reaching and standing vertical than Barnes was Udoka Azubuike who was just a rim running 5.   Even compare Barnes to rim runners like Jarrett Allen, Jaxon Hayes, Etc. He has better standing verticals than all of them, with close to the same standing reach and way more mobility."

"Sadly, I don't think Udoka Azubuike will ever be as good as the player drafted one after him."
"Since it wasn't mentioned explicitly in the post:   2019: Mfiondu Kabengele (Clippers, Cavs)   2020: Udoka Azubuike (Jazz)   2021: Cam Thomas (Nets)    I think Kabengele is unlikely to pan out by this point, but he did get a little extra run for the Cavs at the end of last season, so you never know"
FYI the two players OP excluded to maintain the narrative:  [2019] Mfiondu Kabengele  [2020] Udoka Azubuike
