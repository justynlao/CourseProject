"76ers also have a much better team around Embiid, with another all-star and great defensive player in Simmons, and a borderline all-star in Tobias. Oh, and his backup is Dwight Howard, while Jokic is backed up by Isaiah Hartenstein..."
"lmao alright. It's literally every 30 minutes, someone posts a thread about how Luka is overrated because we are 8-10, like we aren't dealing with injuries/COVID.  Have fun if your team ever gets COVID and Murray/Millsap/Porter etc... are all out for weeks, and instead of having any sort of rational thought, redditers just think your team sucks and that Nikola Jokic is horrible because he isn't winning more games with Vlatko Cancar, Monte Morris, Isaiah Hartenstein, and PJ Dozier as his starters."
eg is currently in hiding after spending the entire preseason spamming how Isaiah Hartenstein is a top 5 center in the league.
last year would have said isaiah hartenstein but then we did in fact trade him lol
"The ""weird guy"" moved to Isaiah Hartenstein prophecy in the meantime, so he feels great about Nuggets having TWO greatest players of all time"
"Lmao. You could say that about lots of players tbf.   ‚ÄúOh boy, I‚Äôm watching Grayson Allen today!‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basketball time! Time to watch Aaron Baynes.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSacramento vs the Nuggets? Time to watch Isaiah Hartenstein do his thing.‚Äù"
"To the Nuggets of course, so he can finally play with Isaiah Hartenstein."
"when jokic (a top 5-10 player in the league) sits, their backup C is isaiah hartenstein. I would be unsurprised if you've never even heard of the guy. The +/- is unsurprising.   Imagine if you went from having prime Shaq on the floor to sending out Darko Milicic, would you find it odd to see the team suddenly look like shit by comparison?"
I hate Isaiah Hartenstein and I want him bullied. His awkwardness brings pain to my eyes.
The Rockets clearly fell short because Isaiah Hartenstein didn‚Äôt get enough post ups
The same dude who said Jokic was gonna be great also said at the start of the season Isaiah Hartenstein was a top 5 center in the league and a walking 20/12/4
"Isn‚Äôt MPJ supposed to be the guy that turns Murray and Jokiƒá into a big three? You‚Äôd think you‚Äôd try to build the dude up with 3 starters injured and a rotation player out. Call plays for him, give him starters minutes. Give him the LONGEST leash instead of the hoodie string leash hes had so far this season. Isn‚Äôt this a good time to build confidence? Actually fuck that lets play Isaiah Hartenstein."
"Harden had guys like Gary Clark, Isaiah Hartenstein, 2-way contract guy, James Ennis, Kenneth Faried starting and y'all act like all his teams were better than what Curry has now. Dumb af"
"Don't forget the stretch in 2019 where they were starting any of James Ennis, Isaiah Hartenstein, Gary Clark, Danuel House fresh out the G-League, and Kenneth Faried."
Didn‚Äôt he make a recent post that Isaiah Hartenstein was going to be as good as Jokic
"Nuggets fan here:   We lost Jeremi grant, Mason Plumlee, and Torrey Craig- which was almost our entire bench unit. Jeremi would come to be a starter and then we‚Äôd pull Millsap off the bench, but yeah, our team didn‚Äôt get better. Isaiah Hartenstein was signed to replace plumlee but has not been playing well and he‚Äôs the only other center on our roster besides Jokic.  Combine that with nagging injuries to Jamal Murray, Gary Harris, and now even PJ Dozier. Our team is being forced to play 3rd string players significant minutes and play our remaining starters too many minutes.   We‚Äôve even attempted small ball (maybe even considered ‚Äúmicro ball‚Äù) lineups, with 4 small guards and Jamykel Green at center, who are always outmatched and cannot make up for their size.   The off-season was not kind to us and even though I believe we could still make a splash in the playoffs with reduced rotation, we‚Äôre going to have trouble getting a good spot with a healthy bunch at this rate."
Current EG pick is Isaiah Hartenstein get in now  LOCK for top 5 center when given minutes üöÄüöÄüöÄ

"Also I‚Äôm pretty sure he just got lucky, he‚Äôs convinced every young Nuggets player no matter who, will be the GOAT. i.e. Jarred Vanderbilt, Isaiah Hartenstein"
Some consider him a prophet. Some call him out on his takes. He's currently ranting about Isaiah Hartenstein as the next great center. Personally i think a lot of his takes are fair but whenever he thinks nobody believes him or whenever people clown him he goes off the deep end and he always doubles down.
Isaiah Hartenstein is at 7.5 fouls per 36 but I'm assuming his minutes are too low to qualify for the leaderboards
"Mohamed ""Isaiah ""top 5 center in the league"" Hartenstein"" Bamba"
"As a Rockets fan, when healthy he was pretty effective against the likes of Rudy, Jokic (beating him down the court), AD (Pels version), and KAT. It was just the Rockets intense focus on beating the Warriors and Green‚Äôs hyper-intelligent approach to dropping back on the lob threat and sitting on Clint‚Äôs legs that motivated Harden to develop an effective floater right before the Unguardable Tour season (where btw he had to play that way bc significant time missed by CP3, Clint, and Eric Gordon). Clint‚Äôs lob was the release valve the Rockets were missing when trading him for RoCo. The Rockets thought they could pick up Nerlen‚Äôs from the Thunder at some point but ironically CP3 and the ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù as I call them (Gallo, Dennis) had them winning so they retained Nerlens. Also now known is that they reportedly offered Isaiah Hartenstein and 2SRP for Wood last season to be that guy. Never got a Clint-lite or comparable in time for Harden and Russ to use."

You must not know about Isaiah Hartenstein
He's doing the same thing about Isaiah Hartenstein now lol
he did hitch his wagon onto isaiah hartenstein next and put himself in self-imposed exile from /r/denvernuggets when that didn't work out so he's not always right
Harrison Barnes would be a great addition I think. JaVale McGee solves the Isaiah Hartenstein problem which is that Isaiah Hartenstein is not very good yet is playing a lot because there's no one else
Isaiah Hartenstein is a made up person you can‚Äôt fool me
Dude is an Isaiah Hartenstein stan now
He went to /r/jokic and last I heard wasn't posting until the Nuggets played Isaiah Hartenstein for 20 minutes saying he was a star. We traded Hartenstein so idk what he's up to now
he tried to do the same thing with Isaiah Hartenstein lmao
"Isaiah Hartenstein looks like a hall of famer in a G league game. Very different brand of basketball between college, G, and Euro. I think seeing a guy succeed in the G league means more than college. But years of Euro league with Luka is not comparable to Greens stint"
Eg was right about Jokic but he also throws a ton of crazy shit at the wall. Some of it is bound to stick. He's obsessed with Isaiah Hartenstein now. Also he's a condescending dick
He now claims Isaiah hartenstein is the next elite center. He got pretty annoying about it on the nuggets sub...but now hartenstein is looking promising on the cavs since traded. You can‚Äôt doubt the wisdom of the profit.
It‚Äôs only cause the Nuggets fumbled the bag by trading the GOAT centre in waiting Isaiah Hartenstein - EG
"One word keeps playing in my mind as I watch quietly in the background this NBA season. Disrespect. Disrespect for Hartenstein's game, his skill, his impact. People treating him like he's not a NBA caliber player. People thinking rookie's are better than him. It's all so very disrespectful. Let's make one thing very Clear. Hartenstein will make the Hall of Fame. He is that GREAT.  **THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOT PLAYING AND PLAYING BADLY.**  For young players it doesn't matter how many minutes you get, it only matters what you do with the playing time you do get. Hartenstein in his career has only played 6 games over 20 minutes. In those games he was 5-1 with a plus minus of +88. The last time Hartenstein played 20 minutes in a game Hartenstein had 17/15/1/2stls/5blks shooting 89% from the field in only 26 minutes of play. Hart was a +39. Now, I want to put that specific stat line in perspective. For one, it's the only time in NBA history a player put up at least 17/15/5blks/2stls on 89% shooting, but more than that, it's the +39 that is unreal. Jokic's career high plus minus is +38. Hartenstein in 26 minutes put up a higher plus minus than Jokic's career high. But it's not just Jokic. Lebron's career high plus minus was also +39. Think about the greatness of Lebron, his longevity, his dominance. Think about how many absolutely terrible teams Lebron has played over his career. Only once was Lebron as dominate from a plus minus perspective as Hartenstein that night.  If this was only a one time thing I wouldn't really care. Many players have fluke historic games. Booker dropped 73, Cory Brewer and Terrence Ross dropped 50. I'm sure if you look though history you will find plus minus performances better than Hart and Lebron's career high. But here's the important detail. It's NOT a one time thing. Hartenstein is constantly a positive helping his team win games. This season **Isaiah Hartenstein leads the Denver Nuggets in net rating.** Not Jokic, not Murray, HARTENSTEIN. When Hartenstein plays the Nuggets are WINNING. The Nuggets are 7-1 when Hartenstein plays more than 11 minutes. Hart is a +64 in those games.  So the obvious question is HOW? How is it Hartenstein is leading the Nuggets in net rating? From a eye test prospective he's been struggling. One word my friend. **DEFENSE.** Requiring at least 25 games played **Isaiah Hartenstein leads all centers in defensive rating.** Hart is averaging 3.3 blocks and 2.1 steals per 100 possessions. Hart is the only player in the NBA that averages 3+ blocks and 2+ steals per100 possessions while being positive in the plus minus. To put those stats into prospective, Kevin Garrett only Averaged 3 blocks and 2 steals per 100 possessions once in his NBA career, the year he won MVP. Isaiah Hartenstein leads the Nuggets in net rating because he's currently playing defense at a similar level to MVP KG. [quick highlight of what I'm talking about](https://streamable.com/n5spcy)  **In Hartenstein Prime he could win DPOY.** That said I'm not sure this level of defense will keep up. This level of defense is probably a simple a flash of what Hartenstein could become defensively. Kind of like how Jokic showed flashes of averaging triple doubles when he was 22-23 years old. We might see some regression defensively, but any regression defensively will be more than compensated for what Hartenstein will give the Nuggets offensively.  Hartenstein has been in a horribly timed shooting slump, Hart is shooting just 53% at the rim (he shot 79% at the rim last season), the game is still fast for him. However Hart will improve dramatically with playing time. I know this because it's not the first time Hartenstein has been in a shooting slump in limited minutes. When Hartenstein played with the Rockets, in the games Hart played less than 15 minutes he averaged per36 11/6/1stl/1blk shooting 51% from the field. Hartenstein struggles when he doesn't get constant playing time. Because **Hartenstein never gets constant playing time**, all people see are the struggles. They don't see what happens when he gets playing time. In the Games Hartenstein played more than 15 minutes he averaged per36 17/16/2blks/1stl shooting 75% from the field. When Hartenstein gets playing time he does the same thing he did in the G-League. Dominates.  The main thing that prompted this post was the last two Nuggets games I saw back to back. The Nuggets played the Grizzles and then Played the Mavericks. One game Hartenstein played, the other game Hartenstein didn't. Jokic, Barton and MPJ played great in both games, Murray Struggled in both games. one game the Nuggets won, the other they were blown out. This back to back was the perfect microcosm of Hartenstein's value as a player.  Hart was the only bench player positive in the plus minus during the Grizzles game, he had 2 blocks and 1 steal in 11 minutes of play. Hartenstein had a defensive rating of 65 in that game. The Nuggets couldn't hit anything, Murray shot 7% in the game, Campazzo was missing open threes, Dozier was 1 of 6. Jokic was coming out after the Grizzles hit an unbelievable deep three to cut the lead to 4. When Jokic came back at the 6 minute mark, the lead was still 4. Nuggets end up winning by one point. Hartenstein didn't take a shot during that stretch, but what he did do is contest every shot, he got deflections steals, blocks. Hartenstein didn't foul. If the Grizzlies went on a run during that stretch jokic was out the Nuggets would have lost. As such **Hartenstein play won the Grizzlies game**  Comparatively, The Nuggets played a back to back against the Mavericks. Malone choose to go with the 20 year old rookie Nnaji instead of Hartenstein and that decision lost the game. Now understand Nnaji is a good player, he can put the ball in the basket and I think he will be in the NBA for a long time. But he is not ready for NBA rotation minutes without Hartenstein or Jokic backing him up. In the Minutes Nnaji plays without Jokic or Hart the Nuggets are -30 net rating. Again Nnaji is good, but he's a rook and he plays like a rook. In this Mavericks game, once then Nuggets put in Nnai the Nuggets gave up layups. So many layups the Nuggets lost the momentum and by the time Jokic came back in the game he couldn't stop the bleeding. The Mavs are too good to not play Isaiah Hartenstein.  So where do we go from here? I want to give advice to 3 people. Malone, Nuggets Fans, and Hartenstein himself.  **For Malone:** I want you to know that I love you. I love your coaching style and I respect you. Truly. Both Jokic and Hartenstein were second round picks, but you gave Jokic a real opportunity to show his talent. You said ""I wouldn't trade Jokic for anybody in the world"" when Jokic was a rookie. Without that opportunity you gave Jokic I don't know where the Nuggets would be. Hartenstein didn't get that opportunity, he was instead sent to the G-League. Hartenstein dominated the G-League, he was the youngest G-League finals MVP in history. His reward for playing great? getting cut. So my advice to you Malone is nothing crazy, just play Hartenstein the same minutes you would have given Plumlee. Hartenstien is not Plumlee, he's much better. But still, that's all he needs. Plumlee never played less than ten minutes, never play Hartenstein less than ten minutes. Let the Young player grow.  **For Nuggets Fans:** Have patience. I understand that Hartenstein doesn't look the best right now. I understand he fouls a lot, I understand he is shooting really bad at the rim. But the Numbers don't lie. When Hartenstein plays basketball the Nuggets are a better team than when Jokic plays basketball. That is not an opinion, that is a fact. MPJ had a 0/8 shooting game, he's still a clear STAR. Hartenstein is the same age as MPJ and should be treated with the same level of understanding. The fouls will end, the finishing will come, and Hartenstein Greatness will begin.  **For Hartenstein:** I believe in you. At times it must feel like no one does. Like no one understands how versatile and great you can be. **Don't give up.** Keep working, keep grinding. Your time will come. hopefully with the Nuggets but if not, that's fine too. Isaiah **YOU ARE GREAT. YOU ARE AMAZING. YOU WILL WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS**"
&gt; they should have had a traditional big off the bench though.  Just gonna disrespect Isaiah Hartenstein like that?
why didn't we trust eg1400 on isaiah hartenstein
Isaiah Hartenstein. I'm not doubting eg14k the prophet a second time.
We took him off the Nuggets hands when he wanted more playing time and they needed cap space.    Also here's the article about him https://theundefeated.com/features/isaiah-hartenstein-nba-draft-2017/
"He‚Äôs a promising young white player. Redditors always seem to attach themselves to random white players who do something well a few times or in limited minutes. We had people saying we should bench Capela for Hartenstein a couple seasons back because Hartenstein had **one** good game in between plenty of shitty games. Fucking Isaiah Harentstein, over Clint fucking Capela. And they were serious."
The prophet Eg has also spoken that Isaiah Hartenstein will be the next Jokic.  Cavs fans better hope their FO is smart enough to lock this future MVP long term
He was absolutely right about Jokic when the majority still thought Nuric was better. He's now moved on to talking about Isaiah Hartenstein just as much as he did Jocic
Lmfao if Isaiah Hartenstein somehow eventually becomes an all star then that dude needs to be hired by an NBA team
Oh God there's an actual future MVP Isaiah Hartenstein sub
"No, he just moved on to stanning Isaiah Hartenstein lol r/Hartenstein"
He now thinks Isaiah Hartenstein will be a superstar. Do what you want with that information.
"You guys should bet on Isaiah ""Jokic-Lite"" Hartenstein instead"
"‚ÄúHello father it is me, Isaiah Hartenstein.‚Äù  -Hartenstein talking to his dad"
"Ok, eg believes Isaiah Hartenstein is a future HoF center too.  I think he is a very interesting character, but usually dudes that can make great ""predictions"" like that have like 200 duds we don't talk about."
Isaiah Hartenstein; couldn‚Äôt spell his name before so I abbreviated. He played really great for us when we acquired him. I think he provides a solid starting big that will allow Mobley to play the 4. He is also wouldn‚Äôt cost as much as Allen and essentially do the same thing.
Clearly you haven't interacted with Isaiah Hartenstein stans
"Ideal?  PG: Cade Cunningham; Darius Garland; Matthew Dellavedova  SG: Steph Curry; Colin Sexton; Dylan Windler  SF: LeBron James; Isaac Okoro; Cedi Osman  PF: Larry Nance Jr; Dean Wade;   C: Jarrett Allen; Isaiah Hartenstein;  Definitely ECF, probably winning another ring"
"PG: Cole Anthony  SG: Payton Pritchard  SF: Terrence Ross  C: Domantas Sabonis  PF: Jerami Grant  Bench: Mike James, Isaiah Hartenstein, Nigel Williams-Goss, Terrence Jones  Btw we counting guys like Kevin Love?"
"I have a lot of affection for a lot of the players on the Cavs, but in my honest opinion, Sexton, Nance, and Allen are basically the only players on our roster that I would consider to be ""good"" right now.  Garland has a ton of potential and looked great at times last season, Okoro has a ton of potential, Dean Wade and Isaiah Hartenstein are lovable memes who sometimes do fun things on the court.  But those three are the only ones I think your average team would want as starters or sixth men as they are right now.  And of the three, the only really consistent one is Sexton.  Nance is consistently good when he's healthy, but he's not a stat sheet stuffer.  And Allen was kind of hot and cold all season."
"A lot of those things in your first part played into health at the time.  And it wasn't CP3 versus Russ. That's the story the media has been talking about. But the Rockets didn't play House for a couple months just to be under the luxury tax in 2019, when he was arguably their third best healthy player. They didn't play Gary Clark to stay under the luxury tax. They spent *multiple* picks to get under the luxury tax when they had expirings they could have traded for rotation players. They yoyoed  Isaiah Hartenstein. Played people like Terrence Jones and James Nunnally for a couple games with no practice just to make the money work. Austin Rivers got cut from the Suns and the Rockets made him a starter.   2019 was all about the Rockets spending picks to stay under the cap and keeping good young players on 10 days and in the g league instead of getting them minutes to be useful in the playoffs."
Isaiah Hartenstein
Probably not all-star level but Isaiah Hartenstein puts up crazy per minute numbers and is an advanced stats darling. Could see him putting up a Nurkic statline with more playing time.

None of those guys are that attractive, though Baynes and Hartenstein I think would be most likely to develop at all, where everyone else I'd say has definitely passed their peak.  Boogie might make the most sense depending on Love's financial desires and the relationship he had with the Lakers as he left. Otherwise, if I'm them, I'm calling Baynes just to have a pretty serviceable, albeit probably below average, starting option.   Hartenstein is also interesting, as he's never really played many games, and he's managed 3 teams in his 3 years, but the kid's only 22 and put up good efficiency (20.3 PER and .62 TS% with a .151 WS/48 and 1.3 BPM) for Cleveland in his limited play, including 2 starts. It would essentially be like drafting a 7-foot European prospect who you know has a low ceiling, which is not bad at all if you could get him for a minimum.  Love I'd say is option #4 - he arguably had the highest peak (maybe Boogie?) and fits the ""we know how to win, and hope to remember despite our age"" ethos of the Lakers lineup at the moment. I think bringing in someone under 33 would be helpful, I think starting a C over 6'8"" would be helpful, and I think having a more traditional C to keep AD happy would make a certain amount of sense, but Love would be an asset off the bench to any team in the NBA rn, so I don't think he's a bad pick by any means."
"Available right now, who could put in minutes at C more usefully than the husk of DeAndre Jordan?  Tacko Fall, Isaiah Hartenstein, Thon Maker - but wait, they're young and have potential to get better, rather than being old and declining, the Lakers don't do that now."
"gonna go with Isaiah Hartenstein, Demarcus Cousins, Aron Baynes, Kyle O'Quinn, and Cristiano Felicio"
"If the Nets buy out DJ, I'd like to see them sign Isaiah Hartenstein to replace him. No idea why the Lakers would prefer DJ to him. I know Hartenstein is bad but at least he can improve. I can promise you neither DJ or Gasol are getting better and are almost certainly getting worse."
"1. the cavs currently have players like isaiah hartenstein, jeremiah martin, lamar stevens, brodric thomas, dean wade, and dylan windler on the roster. Cutting one of them is completely free and wouldn't cost first rounders. (I might've made up one of those names, you wouldn't be able to tell.)  2. You are not getting assets for kevin love, you are giving up assets to give up kevin love.  3. Better fitting pieces as in other teams crap they throw in to match salary? Again look at #2 Kevin love is a negative value, you will give not get anything worthwhile.  I'd also like to add the cavs are not over the luxury tax, they are not competing this year or the next, and that sending kevin love home for the season ala Al Horford on OKC would accomplish the same thing as your hare brained scheme and not cost them picks/actual contributing players to their future."
"According to [bbref ](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/HOU/2019.html), during the 2018-19 season other than Harden, Paul and Capela the players who played significant minutes were: Tucker, Gordon, nene, Gary Clark, Gerald green, james Ennis, faried, danuel house and isaiah hartenstein. Excluding the first two, that were actually good role players, would you consider the others as good players (compared to nba standards obviously)? I wouldn‚Äôt say all of them were bums, but guys like Shumpert (35% FG), Gerald Green (40% FG), and Gary Clark (33% FG) kind of were bums imo. Especially if you consider that 3 years later a good chunk of them are out of the league / rarely play any minutes and another good chunk have even a minor role than on the rockets while playing for a much much worse team. Austin Rivers is the only guy that just 2-3 years later is still a somewhat decent role player"
Only if Isaiah hartenstein becomes a star
"Contextless PER is how EG decided Jokic would be MVP one day (and now thinks the same about Isaiah Hartenstein), so you may be onto something"
"Harden and Zion would be probably the best offensive duo of all time, but I still dont know if they would beat the Lakers. Without tucker it leaves either Zion or Isaiah Hartenstein to guard AD which is obviously terrible. Not to mention Westbrook would most likely have his usual playoff performances so that wouldn‚Äôt help, but overall it would probably be a ridiculously good offensive team and probably a top 3 team"
New dude for EG is Isaiah  Hartenstein
Does this mean Isaiah Hartenstein made the roster?
EG's moved to Isaiah Hartenstein now. Knowing EG's record I had a minor stroke when I learned Isaiah signed with the Clippers.
Who cares about that who would you rather have Isaiah Hartenstein or Evan Mobley
Isaiah Hartenstein probably has him beat
"The thing is he actually backed it up with advanced stats and whatnot  Side note, he recently made a similarly gushing post about Isaiah Hartenstein who I've lowkey believed in since he was on the Rockets so I feel validated that the Jokic prophet is agreeing with my wild take lmao"
"I really wish Isaiah Hartenstein doesn‚Äôt sign with the Clippers. Him and Harry Giles are my project guys :( I wanted the Raptors to go after them and if either of them make the roster I can‚Äôt fully hate the Clippers.  Same for the Sixers, I also can‚Äôt hate Thybulle, he seems very humble and well-adjusted."
thats rockets legend isaiah hartenstein for you
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Iffy and Bjelica &gt;&gt; Curry look at the net rating who cares about context  Isaiah Hartenstein is clearly the best center in the NBA
Isaiah Hartenstein
That's future MVP Isaiah Hartenstein to you
"EG was a guy on here who would religiously talk about how great Jokic was way back in like 2015 when he was largely unknown to most people outside of Nuggets fans. He kinda got shit on by everyone because he constantly said Jokic was better than KAT, Okafor and a bunch of other centers. It was kind of a running meme for a while and then everything he said about Jokic became true. I'm pretty sure nowadays he hypes up Isaiah Hartenstein"
He was really good but the foul trouble wasn't an exaggeration. I was checking rookie stats and Sengun has the worst per 36 for fouls of all rookies. Then I compared it to all players. Isaiah Hartenstein still has a higher rate of fouls than all current rookie players.
remember when Isaiah Hartenstein was actually good on the Rockets but MDA would never play him for some fuckin reason even though they had no center?  &amp;#x200B;  glad he's doing well
"He had Isaiah Hartenstein guarding him, a tall, lanky White dude (most importantly, comes off the bench).  Of course he thinks he could take him on.  Why would he pass it up?"
"CP will forever go off when he has to play in Houston. When he was with OKC, [he nutmegged then Rockets player Isaiah Hartenstein then asked to be taken out of the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y3QUdHychM). üòÇ"
Isaiah hartenstein is half black
"Your friend had an agenda and was being disingenuous.  I was pushing back against their disingenuousness.  There's no way that a reasonable person would say that  Draymond, Wiggins, Poole, Lee, Iguodala, Looney, Bjelica, Porter, Payton  have less talent as a group than  Reggie Jackson, Nic Batum, Terance Mann, Eric Bledsoe, Luke Kennard, Ivica Zubac, Isaiah Hartenstein  Those are all the players (Steph and PG excluded) that have played a minimum of 150 minutes for each team.  You may notice that GSW has 9 names and the Clips have 7.  Here's the thing.  If you guys want to push an agenda, don't do it while misrepresenting what is happening with other teams.  The Cips aren't some stacked roster.  Don't tell lies about us."
Isaiah Hartenstein. You heard it here. Also shoutout to @eg
Isaiah Hartenstein
Isaiah Hartenstein is staring blankly into the void as he continues to foul away his NBA career.
Isaiah Hartenstein vs Cody Zeller is the Wilt v Bill of this generation
