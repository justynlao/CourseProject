I don‚Äôt know why they aren‚Äôt trading for Nerlens Noel about now.
"That‚Äôs because you forget they can sign a good defensive big with the MLE or LLE next year, and don‚Äôt have to win it all this year.  Nerlens Noel should be cheap.  They don‚Äôt need him to score other than rim running and put-backs."
"All those guys are clearly better defensively. I forgot to add Bam Adebayo, who is also clearly better. If you wanna add centres who are debatable with Drummond, you can add: Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, Serge Ibaka and Nerlens Noel. Some ppl may say Jokic and KAT are also similar defensively compared to Drummond. I think you're overrating his defensive impact based on the counting stats."
"Outgoing players: Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, Mo Harkless, Daymean Dotson, Wayne Ellington  Incoming Players: Alec Burks, Austin Rivers, Nerlens Noel, Immanuel Quickley (rookie), Obi Toppin (rookie)"
Nerlens Noel out for this game
search up lamelo tap in against sabonis. that one was good too. also the gordon one over nerlens noel earlier in the season.
"Here was my state of mind as that draft pick happened  ‚ÄúNerlens Noel dropped to 5?? We gonna pick Nerlens!‚Äù  Stern: With the 5th pick of the NBA draft, the Phoenix suns select...  ‚ÄúWelcome to the team Nerlens‚Äù  ...Alex Len  ‚Äú*MOTHERFUCK*‚Äù"
"Steven Adams, Schroder, Nerlens Noel. It was not a bad squad"
"That's awesome that you think that considering he plays 72% of his minutes with Mitchell Robinson and 19% with Nerlens Noel, our actual centers."
Or he could have ended up like Nerlens Noel.
"They should go for Nerlens Noel imo, would be a good fit for the squad and he‚Äôs a better rim protector than DJ and McGee. Unrealistic options would be Myles Turner and KAT. Can you imagine KAT pick n roll with Harden? Quite unstoppable"
Trade kyrie for depth tbh. Can get a few decent players from teams hoping to be competitive. Nets should also trade for Nerlens Noel. Hes an active defender who can contribute as long as you dont ask him to do anything on offense.
"But I was told he was Nerlens Noel who got to catch lobs from James Harden / no better than Alex Len?  Just kidding, all my homies hate lardbiscuits"
Bit of a homer pick but Quickley and probably Nerlens Noel (moreso the latter) as of late although Knicks sub def likes both of them.
I demand Nerlens Noel
"a certain pork-fat breakfast pastry who is a fan of the Philadelphia basketball team called him ""Nerlens Noel who got to play with James Harden"""
"Nerlens Noel would be a good target for you guys. Barely getting any minutes on the Knicks anyway. Is on a 1 year, 5m deal so it fits perfectly into the DPE"
"Ha Seung-Jin, Shawn Bradley, Chris Johnson, Hasheem Thabeet, Nerlens Noel, Ronny Turiaf...   Chuck's point that Shaq is a petty ass bitch who couldn't play in today's league is spot on lol."
"He‚Äôs a reeeeally poor man‚Äôs Nerlens  Pelle is a really undisciplined defender outside of block-hunting, and while Noel struggles with fouling, he‚Äôs a legitimately great defender and plays passing lanes extremely well"
Shout out to Nerlens Noel who signed the vet min for a small market team for 2 years at age 24
Are the numbers going to regress? It's likely. But it's also a good sign of Thibs is instilling a defense-first culture right out of the gates. Even our poorer perimeter defenders are closing out on three point shooters way better than previous years. It also doesn't hurt having Mitchell Robinson and Nerlens Noel on a 48 minute rotation at the C position protecting the paint. Prevent easy threes and prevent easy bucks in the paint. It's a pretty straight forward formula. And to think the team still has more room to improve defensively says a lot about the ceiling this team can eventually have.
Poor mans Nerlens Noel
Very scuffed Nerlens Noel
Why did my brain read Nerlens Noel
They thought that Nerlens Noel (iiirc) getting his ear flicked warranted a flagrant lmao. I'm a Knicks fan but the refs called everything way too tight
"Let‚Äôs go Knicks!!! Everyone is gonna talk about the reffing (rightfully so). But the Knicks led all game, and the Warriors should also try not fouling. Like they fouled Nerlens Noel twice on an inbound. Who does that?"
"Wiseman had Noel sealed in the post, Green passed it in, but James either gave up or tried to fade to the corner right as Draymond let the ball go, and Nerlens got the easy steal."
"They all work.  IMO it's easier to find a ball handling PG than rim-protecting defenders, so I'd go with 1 or 2 over 3 ... but you can make the opposite argument (Nerlens Noel would look pretty good playing with Steph and Jokic, for example)."
Booker lowkey having a stinker of a season on a winning team though.  Empty stats is a good term for guys like the 76ers Nerlens Noel.
Nerlens Noel &gt; MCW
nerlens noel....uh......uh.......uh.....yeah thats it
Nerlens Noel for their 2023 second sounds realistic
"That is a fair point, but I don‚Äôt think someone like a Javale McGee, Nerlens Noel is much of an upgrade.   Bam is also an excellent player who many players struggle against, he‚Äôs quite unique for the centre position."
"If Nerlens Noel consistently knocks down 3s, the Knicks will be scary"
My point was your better of with Nerlens Noel than DeAndre Jordan
"Knicks, what would y‚Äôall give for Spencer Dinwiddie? Like Austin Rivers and Nerlens Noel?"
"Nerlens Noel, MKG, RHJ, Pj Tucker, Mo Harkless"
Nerlens Noel
"LOL dude playing his first game in months comes back, gets upended by Nerlens Noel with an elbow to the hip in an overly aggressive game, and he's labeled soft because his coach isn't Thibs and making him stay in this blowout out of game. Would you like more time to showcase your negative knowledge of the NBA or are you satisfied with where you're at now? Because we are good either way"
"&gt; So you honestly don't think someone like Nerlens Noel could do most of what Zach Collins does?  I don't get where you're going with this.  What exactly do you think we are gaining by not extending Collins this year?  &gt; He's really not as good as Blazers fans make him out to be  Maybe not, but he's certainly better than Nerlens Noel, younger than Nerlens Noel, and has more potential than Nerlens Noel.  And again not re-signing Collins has absolutely nothing to do with our ability to sign Noel."
"Lol it‚Äôs tank time, hopefully we don‚Äôt trade our best player for nerlens Noel then take 2 centers in a row"
The Adams trade and extension were both absolutely awful moves by him. Who the hell sinks that much trade capital and cap space into a traditional center? Just go sign like Nerlens Noel or something for a fraction of the price without having to trade away draft picks.
"And Davis, Nerlens Noel, etc. It's pretty absurd."
Y'all couldn't at least get someone like Nerlens Noel though?
"Yeah, if they are looking for frontcourt depth, they need to be trying to get a Nerlens Noel type, relatively cheap but can be effective in a limited role."
Buyout? He‚Äôs making the min. They could just cut him. Same with Nerlens Noel.
Lol come on of course they got better. Deandre Jordan is still a serviceable rim protector and they can always trade for someone like Nerlens Noel. And Bruce Brown is underrated. Of course Kyrie and Harden will be staggered too to help the bench out.
"Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes, Boban?"
Nerlens Noel
Nah chilllll. What about Nerlens Noel and a clippers first üòé
Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel has entered the chat
Wheres the dunk on nerlens noel. That's what the people need. He baptized him a second time.
"The title is written as though Hayward fouled Nerlens Noel. Should be ""Gordon Hayward with a two handed slam on Nerlens Noel and the foul"""
He had a monster dunk over nerlens noel too. If anyone has the clip make a post ur gonna get tons of karma
"You made the comparison  not me.  The point was you can't compare what Hinkie did because it was unprecedented which is why what the league did was unprecedented.  And btw he traded a 22 year old ago star Jrue Holiday for an injured Nerlens Noel and a pick so he traded a player better than SGA. And it's also a microcosm of why he's essentially banned from the league.   He then took that pick and traded it for Saric and another pick knowing Saric couldn't come over.  Great transaction absolutely but the body of work showed a pattern of behavior the league couldn't allow.  This isn't a difficult notion.  It had nothing to do with lying or being up front.  If he would have even made a fake attempt at putting out a 35 win team he could've kept doing the asset flipping. But he was trying to put out 15 win teams on purpose, year after year. That is untenable"
I‚Äôm also positive the process Sixers ran this lineup in their darkest days   PG: Jakarr Sampson 6‚Äô7  SG: Hollis Thompson 6‚Äô8  SF: Jerami Grant: 6‚Äô9  PF: Jahlil Okafor 6‚Äô11  C: Nerlens Noel 6‚Äô11  406 inches
I thought Nerlens Noel would be a 3 times DPOY.  A KG without the offensive game and without demanding the ball
"Nerlens noel at kentucky looked like a future star, but when he tore his acl (i think) on a chase down block, i feel like it set him back"
"Granted some of these guys are still respectable NBA players, but I thought they all had All-Star/All-Defense upside at the very least:  Jabari Parker  Nik Stauskas  Nerlens Noel  Kris Dunn  Frank Ntilikina  Terrence Ross  Evan Turner  Perry Jones III"
"You're missing some key points - Nerlens Noel just came back from injury, Alec Burks, Ntilikina, and Obi Toppin are also out. The bench is stretched super thin - that's why players are getting that heavy load."
2015 is a bad example because no one else was close.  Wiggins was going up against Mirotic (who surprisingly got a lot of votes) and Nerlens Noel.  In 2003 LeBron won ROY btw
They should‚Äôve signed Nerlens Noel when they had the chance. Montrezl for him would still be a good deal down the line he‚Äôs just a bad fit with this team.
"Literally right now we have 2 healthy bigs on the roster (Randle and Robinson).  Obi Toppin, Omari Spellman and Nerlens Noel are all injured."
The reason they‚Äôre playing so much minutes is because half the team is injured. Mitchell Robinson played 40 minutes because Nerlens Noel and Obi Toppin are injured. Same goes for Randle and RJ
"His sub is hurt, and Nerlens Noel isn't exactly on the lower end of backup bigs."
the Blazers have absolutely non existent rim protection. Hopefully nurkic can get back to pre-injury but regardless think the Blazers should try and trade for a bench big that offers rim protection (someone like Nerlens Noel?)
Nerlens Noel was not a Klutch signee when he tossed that deal. That's not on them.
...i mean its not the first time. See KCP and Nerlens Noel.
he didn't know that would happen at the time the trade was blown up smh.  Nerlens Noel turned down a ton of money... and bet wrong.
"Nerlens Noel might be even worse, guy didnt even get injured just screwed himself"

"Richaun Holmes, Dario saric, Jerami grant, Zach Lavine, Markelle Fultz, tj McConnell, kristaps porzingis, devonte graham, Roco, Ja, nerlens noel"
"PG: Ish Smith/TJ McConnell  SG: Robert Covington/Tony Wroten  SF: Jerami Grant/Nik Stauskas  PF: Christian Wood/Jahlil Okafor  C: Richaun Holmes/Nerlens Noel  Team would still be pretty bad, but they'd at least be competitive these days."
"2017 they still had Kristaps, Noah (of course he became a tire fire but at the time there was still some hope he could be at least solid), Frank Ntilikina (who was just drafted with high hopes)   2018 Knicks had DeAndre Jordan, Dennis Smith Jr. (thought to be a future star), Frank Ntilikina (who still had more hope back then) and Mitchell Robinson   76ers:  2013: ROY MCW, Nerlens Noel (granted he was hurt but still had that hope)  2014: Noel, Robert Covington, Joel Embiid (missed year but still carried massive hope)   2015: Noel, Covington, Embiid (still hurt), Jalil Okafor (was still an all rookie guy with upside at time)  2016: Covington, Embiid, Saric (decently regarded draft and stash guy playing his first year), Simmons (hurt the whole year but still was a hopeful impact guy)   Nets 10 years ago had Brook Lopez"
from the AD kick on Nerlens Noel argument to these three sweet ass plays
Randle is currently playing very solid defense next to Mitchell robinson and nerlens noel. Pair him next to zubac in starting line ups and your front court can switch and protect the rim. Lonzo is known as a great defender. It looks to me like the only thing that would have been needed is to find a legit three and d wing to fill out the starting five.
Nerlens Noel and MCW if you wanna count him
Nuggets gonna need to trade for Nerlens Noel   Neither Jamychal green or millsap are fit to play defense next to Jokic or even the back up minutes at 5
"I‚Äôve heard it said that once you get the vet min stink on you, it‚Äôs hard to get it off. Like Nerlens Noel. Rondo got it off with a huge playoff performance and also the fact that he had a long history and reputation before he started getting on vet mins."
Zion got those nerlens Noel brick hands
I no longer want nerlens Noel as my bismack biyombo replacement
"Dragic‚Äôs a good choice for sure.   I‚Äôd add Jordan Clarkson, Gary Trent Jr., Nerlens Noel, Norman Powell, Joe Ingles (if he still comes off the bench, can‚Äôt remember), Shake Milton‚Äôs should get to be in this category too with some consistency. Saric has been kind of amazing in Phoenix as a bench big as well.  edit: Naz Reid"
"A couple things worth noting, He's actually tied with Gobert in Defensive Win Shares (Gobert may have a slight edge since he was listed above him)  Looking at Defensive rating, the top 5 are Gobert, Nerlens Noel(damn thibs), AD, Marc Gasol, then Lebron.  Do with this info what you want."

"He's either going to Miami on a lot less money or to a smaller team that's willing to take a gamble on him.  Houston offered him something, he turned it down. Doesn't look like anyone else in the league wants to offer him any big contract too. Might be the next Nerlens Noel."
"Is it a stretch to say Nerlens Noel can make one all defensive team this year? I think when Mitch comes back he will nab the starting spot back but Noel has been very good, he‚Äôs avenging 2 blocks and a steal while having the third best DRTG in the league"
"Nerlens Noel is a solid Nba player and should have a long career, but he will always get some shit because he is sort of a draft bust. He was VERY hyped coming into the league, and really hasn‚Äôt improved at all. He was a great defender from the jump, but it‚Äôs been like 5+ years now and he has yet to refine any parts of his offensive game which is disappointing.   Had Noel been drafted later / less hyped, he would be viewed for what he actually is, instead he will always be viewed for what he never became"
"Nerlens Noel is not that good - he has been great this year especially with the absence of Mitch, he makes the right play in defense a lot, gets blocks and steals on the regular and has the the third best DRTG in the league. He‚Äôs also a pretty good rim runner, but the rest of his offense is subpar and he has an insane case of the Evan Engram hands. Overall he‚Äôs pretty good and I loved the signing from day one."
Nah I think its Nerlens Noel
"Kentucky  PG: Jamal Murray, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, John Wall  SG: SGA, Tyler Herro, Malik Monk  SF: Devin Booker and Keldon Johnson  PF: Anthony Davis and Julius Randle  C: Towns, Bam Adebayo, Enes Kanter  There‚Äôs also Eric Bledsoe, Nerlens Noel and DeMarcus Cousins if he can get back to at least a portion of what he was."
"I've seen clips of Nerlens Noel dunking, does that make him All-NBA?"
"Isn't there an article someone did where they simulate the NBA 20 years in the future, except they make the talent progressively worse?  I think Nerlens Noel ends up dominating the league or something"
They should trade for Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel  He's a complete 0 on offense but he's really all you can ask for defensively. He should be making a lot more money than he is for his skillset. I think he's a guy who could help any team in the league really.
"Can he be a different Nerlens, and the same Noel?"
this comment has been blocked by nerlens noel
"High efficiency, low usage big men on good offenses always have great offensive ratings. Tyson Chandler and DeAndre Jordan have both led the league multiple times. It's not a very meaningful stat. If you put Nerlens Noel on the Clippers in Zubac's place he'd probably have similar numbers"
That just creates more snubs  &gt; [Nerlens Noel] Can‚Äôt help but think how fake it is...
nerlens noel has been great on defense
Trade Looney and a 2nd round pick for Nerlens Noel
"Boogie might have them beat, but Isaiah Thomas and Nerlens Noel are two guys who would be worth wayyyy more if not for injuries (Noel was stupid for betting on himself, but nonetheless)"
"My point is that if you dont value the C position then dont spend $10 mil on it when that's your one resource to add to your team in the offseason via non trade. You cant spend $10 mil on a guy who at most addresses one of those needs you listed above. Backup C is the most replaceable position in the NBA, if your concern is wanting another C because of what Bam did last year in the ECF go offer someone like Nerlens Noel the minimum who instead took 1 yr $2.5 mil from the Knicks. Or whomever doesnt matter but there's always someone you can find for that role that for cheaper/less resource allocation.   &gt;more flexibility to go chase a player who could fix those issues.  The idea of the $27 mil exception and the idea of ""having flexibility"" may end up being better than the actual reality of it. Other thing about the Turner trade is you are getting a first and McDermott back. McDermott as a backup floor spacer can help an average offense. And another first is something you can throw in for trades.   The tax implications are part of why the value of that exception could be limited, I dont really know if they want to spend the whole $27 mil."
A person in our sub thinks that Drummond is a low risk piece to acquire and that he would solve our teams problems with rebounding. His defensive prowess is no where near that of Mitchell Robinson or Nerlens Noel and that‚Äôs what the Knicks top 10 defense is built off of lol
Nerlens Noel and what eventually became Dario Saric for Jrue Holiday was a great move. Getting rid of Asik's contract for Nikola Mirotic was another one. Pels made a lot of dumb ass decisions but they've been snake bitten too.
"Somehow was a free agent in fantasy, obviously picked him up.   Dude cut him for Nerlens Noel."
"**First year after drafting AD:**  Traded for Ryan Anderson  Matched the Suns offer for Eric Gordon  Traded for Robin Lopez  **Season 2:**  Traded Nerlens Noel and a 1st for Jrue Holiday  Traded for Tyreke Evans  **Season 3:**  Traded a 1st for Omer Asik  Traded for Quincy Pondexter and Norris Cole  **Season 4**  Re-signed Ajinca, Asik, and Dante Cunningham to long term deals  **Season 5**  Signed E'Twuan Moore  Signed Solomon Hill  Traded for Boogie and Omri Casspi  **Season 6**  Signed Rajon Rondo  Traded for Nikola Mirotic  **Season 7**  Signed Julius Randle  Signed Elfrid Payton  ----  Many of these were not successful for various reasons through injury or our coaching staff just mis-judging the potential a player had who then failed to reach it after a huge contract.  But we made shit tons of deals and signings to try to surround AD with people who the coaching staff thought would be contributors.  Saying ""Free Agents dont want to go there"" is the entirely wrong conclusion to draw."
The best I can do is.....Nerlens Noel.

Mitchell Robinson and Nerlens Noel for co mvp I guess
WHERE MY NERLENS NOEL STANS AT
Shades of Nerlens Noel
"Nerlens Noel is a better target than a lot of these guys, but with Mitch injured, not sure how willing the Knicks will be to sell on him."
Nerlens Noel..thought he would be like a AD type player and dominant in todays game
Nerlens Noel revenge szn.
"Sucks for the Knicks, he's a big part of their defense. Nerlens Noel being your only backup C also isn't ideal."
"Despite playing for the Lakers, Caruso is hella underrated. I see all the games. He's our 3rd most important player. He impacts the game in so many ways, it is amazing.  I always liked Nerlens Noel too, outside of my team.  Valanciunas, is a very decent player. In my opinion underrated.  And Vucevic is a nearly superstar player that reminds me of Pau Gasol. Nobody talks about him as they should. But, if he were playing for a winning team or LA, Chicago, Philly... He would be on the best Center of the league conversation.  I know Sabonis is an all star. But seeing him play consistently, being great also as a passer, shooter... Makes me feel so good because I saw his father play before injuries and I thought we lost one of the best ever. His son is compensating that lose with the basketball gods.  Good offensive players that are holes on defense are overrated. Lou Will is the perfect example."
"Maybe Nerlens Noel when he thought he should get the max? I wanna out Dwight for thinking the Houston offense should go through him more, but he was arguably the 2nd best player in the league for a couple of years. Hard to remember that lol."
"If Nerlens Noel can be as good as he was defensively last year, they should be fine"
As a Nerlens Noel fantasy owner its going to be really annoying seeing Taj playing 32 mins a game
Nerlens Noel
"Pretty sure in his book he says that in hindsight he feels that Jamie Dixon was sandbagging him to keep nba interest in him low to make sure he kept him for multiple years instead of going one and done.   Adams was definitely raw but he wasn‚Äôt as raw as Pitt made him look. Look at his first game in the U.S for instance, a high school matchup with Nerlens Noel https://youtu.be/GpnqLsaFRA8. Noel ended up with 14 and 6 along with 7 blocks and a steal, while Adams, who just stepped off the plane, put up 23 and 10 with 3 blocks and 2 assists and the Win. Then Noel went to Kentucky and averaged a double double with gaudy steal and block numbers, he was the clear number 1 pick before injury, while Adams did everything Dixon told him to and looked like he‚Äôd never seen a basketball before  Dixon put a whole lot of arbitrary restrictions on him (He wouldn‚Äôt let him shoot, even in practice. He would barely let him practice his post game. He had potential as a passer in the post but again he wasn‚Äôt allowed to even practice that skill. He wouldn‚Äôt even put him in positions to impact the boards half the time) Dixon would always say ‚Äòwe‚Äôll work on expanding your game in the coming seasons‚Äô. He said for the first season he only wanted Adams to focus on setting good screens on offense and getting better at hedging out on screens on defense.   Ironically, trying to hide Adams real potential is probably what caused him to rocket up the draft boards once NBA teams actually got him in the building. He looked like a stiff with NBA size in college but in workouts he actually had shooting touch, he was actually a talented passer, he was just a far better player than people thought. GMs love finding diamonds in the rough so he went in the lottery"
I mean sure but it's like saying Joakim Noah is better shooter than I dunno Nerlens Noel  They're both not good at it and below average so does it really matter?
Why would Nerlens Noel would turn down that contract?
Nerlens Noel is dumb
"I watched a lot of Rockets games last season and they played down to their competition. Their record didn't paint the full picture tbh. Harden went through a slump in Jan and that's when Russ started playing better, he went on a tear after the Capela trade and I def remember him being their best player for a good 4-5 weeks before the break.   You're right, small ball isn't sustainable for an entire season and that's why their record was mediocre. If you actually watched them play, you'd be able to tell the nights that they were actually trying. Also the original plan was to get a budget center in Nerlens Noel but the owner was too cheap and they went into playoffs with no true center. I'm pretty confident in saying that a healthy Brodie along with a center on the roster could've taken the Lakers to 6 or 7 games."
Finally somebody brave enough to come out and prove Giannis is just a store brand Nerlens Noel.
Nets better trade DJ. He would do better on a team like the Suns where he‚Äôd come off the bench and catch some lobs. The Nets need a defensive big like Nerlens Noel or Derrick Favors.
"I'm scared I'm going to get hated on for this, but I wonder if the Knicks could trade for him to solidify playoff hopes.  They have the cap space this year to bring him on without sending out a ton of salary/players- they could do Frank (who's in the doghouse anyways), and one of Elfrid (since they wanna develop IQ), or Nerlens Noel since he's going to lose minutes (even when healthy) if they did this.  They could be offering the cap relief instead of picks, maybe even ask for a 2nd or something.   The contract is big, but Knicks have one of the cleanest cap sheets moving forward.  They could get a vet for RJ and IQ, get some playoff experience, and they could build their future roster with everything else coming off the books.   Idk if making the playoffs is worth the contract for them, but they're one of the few who could use him who aren't over the cap."
"Idk what I just read... Man said we wouldn't trade Payton, We wouldn't trade Bullock. He messed up Paytons salary. Tried to say we could trade for a backup center and forgot we had/didn't mention Nerlens Noel. Then forgot Rose in what could be our ""nine man playoff rotation."""
"It‚Äôs not how many centers could shoot 3s, it‚Äôs how many centers had the same skill set as Nerlens Noel...which was and is a lot.   This isn‚Äôt hindsight either, at the time I thought the Mavs offered too much and Nerlens Noel was going to regret his decision to turn it down. The whole thing should be a huge black mark for Rich Paul, but being ü§û with Lebron means he doesn‚Äôt have to worry about such things."
Nerlens Noel will be the first member
Nerlens Noel sized regrets
"I mean, Dipo is still going to clear 100m in career earnings...not sure why everyone is acting like this is Nerlens Noel."
Nerlens Noel for another player
New Nerlens Noel anybody? BeT ON YoUrSeLF  For every Fred VanVleet there are tons of Nerlens Noels and Oladipos.
"Nerlens Noel turning down that deal was delusional at the time too. He‚Äôs a prototypical big that can‚Äôt space the floor in a league that only cares about bigs if they can space the floor, or are all-time great at defense."
Nerlens Noel type beat
Some of the comments are just legendary. Dudes getting downvoted for saying they‚Äôd rather have Nurk or Jokic over Nerlens Noel (who is good but still) lol
TJ McConnell  Nik Stauskas  Robert Covington  Jahlil Okafor  Nerlens Noel   Checkmate.
"Nerlens Noel is a black hole on offense, and him, Plumlee, and Dwight get into foul trouble much more quickly compared to Adams which isn't what they want for a starting center. Look I'm not the biggest fan of Adams, but the biggest fault in the Pels roster planning is that they're guards are very bad/inconsistent if we're being honest. None of them can reliably play the PnR game with Zion and they really aren't good shooters. Zion doesn't really need a center who stretches the floor if he were to get better spacing in the rest of the positions. In fact, having him not go for every Offensive rebound with Adams in there means he won't get banged up in his early years which is much more beneficial. Getting Adams wasn't the best move, but it isn't the sole root to all of the Pels problems like most people on here make it out to be."
"&gt; a slight overpay for a starting caliber center  It's an extreme overpay for a traditional big. Centers who don't shoot 3s and can't defend on the perimeter are of extremely limited value in today's NBA. If all you want is a big dude who can sit in the dunker's spot and block shots, there's no need to pay that kind of money to get a player like that. Look at what guys like Ivicia Zubac, Mason Plumlee, Dwight Howard or Nerlens Noel are making: combined they are making $8 million less than Steven Adams is making by himself this season."
"Sorry, no, that's a horrible deal for a traditional big like Steven Adams. If all he wanted was a big dude who can't shoot 3s or guard on the perimeter but can sit in the dunker's spot and block shots he could have got any number of guys who fit that description for dirt cheap and not had to waste any draft picks to get them. Go look at what Dwight Howard and Nerlens Noel signed for and you'll see that trading George Hill and a 1st round pick just so you could pay Steven Adams $66 million over the next 3 seasons was an insane overpay."
"Yes it was absolutely the best game of his career, if not top 5. Not even close? Just shut up lmao  Trae and Clint coming out is a bigger blow than going from Miles Robinson to Nerlens Noel. Jesus Christ you‚Äôre insane  I also never said it‚Äôs a done deal. I said if Randle doesn‚Äôt go nuclear against us like he did in the regular season then we take the series. Calm down dude"
"Victor ""Nerlens Noel"" Oladipo"
I was convinced that Nerlens Noel made the right decision. Wow was I wrong.
"&gt; Christian Wood  my bad, I didn't know he was playing center this year  &gt; Porzingis  Plays zero defense (most important thing for a center!), offence consists purely of chucking bad shots, always hurt. Maybe he'll stay healthy and return to all-star form the more time passes since his injury, but I'm taking Ayton over him this year.  &gt; Sabonis  he's a power forward  &gt; Turner  not gonna lie, I haven't watched enough Pacers games to have an opinion  &gt; Capela  ok, sure  &gt; Ibaka  Hell no, and I say this as someone who owns an Ibaka jersey. He has become quite overrated.  &gt; Poetl  Andris Biedrins 2.0  &gt; Nerlens Noel  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1Ui-R1NGow  &gt; Brook Lopez  Hmm. Ayton is a much more switchable defender. Brook is kinda slow. Although Brook's ability to space the floor makes him better offensively. It's up in the air between these two imo."
"Christian Wood, Porzingis, Sabonis, Turner,  Capella, Ibaka(maybe), Poetl(maybe), Nerlens Noel(maybe), Brook Lopez(maybe)  So at best he's the 12th best center.  At worst he's the 16th."
How about Nerlens Noel turning down 4 years/$70 million from the Mavericks? So far he's made about $27m in his 8 years in the league with the current $5m contract from the Knicks being his largest.   Obviously he's still a rich and successful athlete but a lot of people would beat themselves up over a decision like that
Weird that Nerlens Noel 2.0 is Dipo's relatively small ass
"&gt;They are all good defensively, and still dont have an all defense 2nd teamer.  Last year, Brook Lopez was the second-team All-defense center.  I don't see any reason why Nerlens Noel should not replace him this year.  &gt;They gonna give the hawks hell in the first round.  I expect so."
"The old Nerlens Noel/Lance Stephenson guide to handling extensions, classic."
"It's basically just all on Wiseman and hoping Klay comes back 80%+. Assuming the Minny pick is outside of the top 3, getting a good young contributor from that would be great too.  Aside from that there's not much that the org can really do to improve the team further. Hopefully we can re-sign Oubre, in which case the rotation would look like:  Steph / Poole  Klay / Bazemore / Lee  Wiggins / Oubre  Draymond / Toscano  Looney / Wiseman  That starting lineup is probably the best in the NBA, and the bench will be pretty good too, assuming Wiseman can improve to the level of positive contributor and Poole keeps improving too.  Mulder won't be on the team next season, nor will Smailagic. As much of a fan of Paschall I am, he's far better in an iso based system where he can just go to work in a face up on the low block, so I'd much rather trade him to a team where he can excel in return for Nerlens Noel or something(just as an example. someone of that caliber).  Also, Bazemore is good in general but I don't want him in the rotation unless he stops fouling so often. If we can get a respectable backup SG I'd be ecstatic. That would be a genuinely successful offseason to me lmao. If we can re-sign Marquese Chriss along with that I'd love Bob Myers forever."
I think he stopped because he almost litteraly killed Nerlens Noel when he attemptet to poster him.  https://youtu.be/qluyhf6SDSU
Look up Wiggins top 10 dunks. He has some absolutely insane ones from his early Minny days but ever since he flatlined Nerlens Noel he doesn‚Äôt seem to chase posterizers anymore  Edit : [here](https://youtu.be/NT5tvMfj_co)
Package him and the Minny pick for a solid wing defender and sign Nerlens Noel or Richaun Holmes.
Nerlens Noel
"Dwight, Richaun Holmes and Nerlens Noel all make less than Jax and are better right now."
"yea he's proven this year he can handle a bigger role on the Knicks, and in the past he's proven he's great off the bench so I think he would probably be the best fit for you guys. Being able to have both Robert Williams and Nerlens Noel would give you guys a lot of flexibility. You could put in Nerlens Noel in situations where you need more defense, or keep Rob Williams in when you need more offense."
I think we should go for nerlens Noel
"wait you mean Grant Williams right? I assume Robert Williams will be starting. if by chance u mean Grant, I don't really see that working out. From what I've seen, he's really not that great of a player. Y'all definitely should try to avoid playing an undersized center rotation for yet another year especially considering you play in the conference with Joel Embiid, Giannis, and Bam all playing on top eastern conference teams... I think you guys need another real big (look how dwight howard has done wonders for the Sixers this year, a backup center that is essentially a starting quality big is extremely important for a successful team IMO). I think you guys should sign someone like Dwight Howard(although, as I Sixers fan, I hope we re-sign him), Javale McGee, Richaun Holmes, or Nerlens Noel"
"On the benches are Kyle Anderson, Enes Kanter, Seth Curry, Derrick Favors, Patty Mills, and Nerlens Noel."
Cedi Osman &gt; Larry Bird  Nerlens Noel &gt; KG  And Michael Carter Williams plays the closest to Paul Pierce‚Äôs game we‚Äôve ever seen  Edit: Also Payton Pritchard &gt; Lebron
"Nerlens Noel went from being a potential overpay to one of the more underrated centers in the league. Great for his PR, bad for his wallet.  Also I'm convinced that Thibs will turn Taj Gibson into NYK's version of Udonis Haslem."
I am an honorary Process Sixers fan and to prove it I'm naming the entire 15-16 team one by one  PG: Ish Smith/TJ Mcconnell/Kendall Marshall  SG: Hollis Thompson/Isaiah Canaan/Nik Stauskas  SF: Robert Covington/JaKarr Sampson  PF: Carl Landry/Jerami Grant/Elton Brand  C: Jahlil Okafor/Nerlens Noel
Best case: Cj for Tobias harris.  Roco+ DJJ + Pick for Harrison barnes.  Sign a back up guard like Patty Mills.  Sign a back up big like Nerlens Noel.  Resign Powell and Melo.  Our lineup would look like this:  PG: dame/Mills  SG:Norm/Ant  SF: Barnes/Nas  PF:Harris/Melo  C: Nurkic/Noel/Collins
"Pretty much every Knicks player is having their best season this year. I would take Bledsoe over Elfrid in a heartbeat. He‚Äôs having a great year, but Steven Adam‚Äôs has historically been better than Nerlens Noel.  The difference between the Knicks and Pels is coaching."
Nerlens Noel turning into Prime Hakeem
nerlens noel revenge series
"Yeah, this. At the draft Toppin was a solid pick, he looked like one of the few NBA ready prospects. Randle just completely killed the chance of him getting any minutes, plus Nerlens Noel has played really solid for the them too. It all adds up to Obi not having any real chance at minutes."
"He fucked up Nerlens Noel style after that. The Kings offered a five year, $38.5 million dollar contract but he declined. Then he didn't get a lot of offers and signed a 2 year 4.5M contract with Houston. He was out of the NBA after those 2 years."
Remember the Nerlens Noel days
"You don't think they are tanking when they roll out a starting line up of Tony Wroten, Nerlens Noel, Chris Johnson, Hollis Thompson, and Henry Sims?"
He's going to end up like Nerlens Noel if he isn't careful.
"Knicks:  1. Derrick Rose, SS, great defender, sill enough speed, good contender to be a 20/20 guy, maybe will have to be a 2B/3B later in his career if his knees give out 2. Julius Randle, 3B, man is in purely for his offense, average/below average defender 3. RJ Barrett, P, Shohei Ohtani type player, I've seen some nice full court football style passes from him this year 4. Obi Toppin, RF, Hiding him in RF for shaky defense but will definitely make some highlight plays. great athleticism makes him a potential 30/30 guy 5. Mitchell Robinson, 1B, nothing is getting over his head at 1B, massive strike zone is  definitely negative though 6. Immanuel Quickley, LF, I could see him being a plus defender in left, probably more of a put it in play, don't strike out guy on offense. 7. Elfrid Payton, 2B, No chance he hits over the mendoza line but will play gold glove level defense. 8. Frank Ntilikina, CF, great reaction time make him a premier defensive center fielder, his quick hands give him a potential utility role as a middle infielder. 9. Nerlens Noel, C, Gonna hose guys down at second, veteran leader who can call a good game for our young pitcher. Like the 7 and 8 hitters, likely won't do much on offense"
"Why are you acting like Terrance Ferguson was terrible? Dude played great defense while shooting 38% from 3 on 3.6 attempts, thats good.   I don‚Äôt think raw PPG stats are gonna tell you anything about a role players performance especially when considering that stars in the playoffs will naturally shoulder a larger offensive burden and will take more shots as a result   Also wasnt OKC in 2019 one of the best defensive teams? They had PG13(a DPOY candidate), Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel, DS17, Ferguson, Adams and Markieff  2020 had Gallo, DS17, Dort, SGA, Noel, Adams, Bazely    Wouldn‚Äôt say thats a huge difference in fact one could argue the former had better personnel   I dont think either Westbrook or PG13 played all that well that series at least from an efficiency perspective"
"Nerlens Noel wanted more and cost himself a TON of money by signing a tender instead of taking the contract.    There is way too much risk with that move for most non-superstar players.  If a KD or a LeBron type player suffers an injury, quite a few teams will line up to take the rehab year and have that player on the team the next 3 years.      Someone like Boogie Cousins or IT has a bad injury?  He loses a lot of money."
"Throw Nerlens Noel in there, too. Very similar steal/block production as Thybulle."
"It depends on who‚Äôs available and for what price.    If we draft Mobley, that‚Äôs our PF going forward.   If we‚Äôre trading for Collins, Rubio is definitely in for salary.   Other than that I have no clue who we might get and for what.  Jonathon Isaac?  Myles Turner?  Sign Nerlens Noel with the MLE and let KAT play part time PF?    It really depends on who other teams are interested in trading/re-signing."
If Reggie Bullock and Nerlens Noel put their heads togther they could create one complete haircut
I thought they were referring to Top 5 DPOTY Candidate Nerlens Noel
Are you referring to All Defense player Nerlens Noel? If so I am pleased to hear this news
"Forr the UFA maybe go for some or one of          Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Harry Giles, Cody Zeller, James Johnson, Otto Porter Jr          For the RFA which imo they are unlikely to sign         Lauri Markkanen, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Duncan Robinson         Everytime I've watched the Spurs this year im always thinking man they need some more Interior Defense, Rebounding, and scoring from the big. Another path I think they can take is getting a shooter that is around 6'6 where imo Devin Vassell or even Keldon can mold into the PF spot as the never really played a traditional big at PF, it was usually Rudy/Demar and sometimes Lyles/Keldon. Outside of Jakob's defense his offensive game is abysmal and his backups are weak both defensively and offensively."
1. Nerlens Noel  2. Taj Gibson  3.-5. irrelevant
"Yeah I don't think the current Knicks would be too expensive to keep and the Knicks could definitely afford it.  I think the Knicks should look to keep that core, not only Barrett, Robinson and Randle, but also Quickley and stick a bit longer with Bullock, Burks, Rose and Nerlens Noel.  These guys seem to work well together and are like-minded group with Thibodeau. This kind of stuff does not come that easy."
They should be pursuing someone like Nerlens Noel.
"I'd take Mitchell Robinson and Nerlens Noel over Andre Drummond. Hell, maybe even Taj Gibson too. Andre Drummond is REALLY bad."
Nerlens Noel is much better.
I don‚Äôt blame him because free agency is very fast paced. The Lakers kept him on hold but the sixers already offered him a contract. There could‚Äôve been a scenario where Dwight told the sixers ‚Äúnah I‚Äôm gonna wait to see if the Lakers will offer me a contract‚Äù and the sixers go ahead and sign someone like Nerlens Noel and the Lakers decide not to resign him and Dwight has to go to a team he probably doesn‚Äôt really want to go to.
"The difference there is Chris Paul, Danillo Gallinari, Steven Adams, Dennis Schroeder, Terrance Feguson, Hamidou Diallo, and Nerlens Noel  Literally half our team"
"Chris Paul didn't really fit the timeline for OKC though.    Jrue Holiday, MCW, Nerlens Noel, Jeremi Grant were all young players while traded for future assets.   For OKC to do something similar, they need to trade SGA, Dort, Poku, Bazley, Maledon, etc for future picks."
Jerami grant too and nerlens noel although he was a high draft pick.
"Sixers top picks ended up injured regardless of their injury history.  Embid, fultzs, and the allergy guy missed time even when the Sixers were competing for the playoffs.  I just wanted to say that choosing players spefically because they were injured is disingenuous.  I agree that choosing 2 big men in nerlens noel and jahlil okafor and then embid because they were the best player available is bad on hinlies part. It was the right move but creating a logjam in the frontcourt made the tank even more pronounced."
"Every move he made was the correct decision.  &gt;intentionally drafted seriously injured players  Draft Embiid ‚úÖ  &gt;traded a 22 year old Jrue Holiday  For Nerlens Noel, and a pick that became Saric, who was part of the trade for Butler ‚úÖ  &gt;traded a rookie of the year MCW  Traded him at his absolutely highest value, received what was technically the Mikal Bridges pick. ‚úÖ"
"We'll see a few starters come out from this thunder team.  They had Jerami grant, Robert covington, t.j McConnell, nerlens noel who all improved afterwards.  Lakers had the same issue where the players improved afterwards like lonzo, Ingram, randle, and Clarkson. And Larry nance jr. Is injured.  They all played not good enough(for LeBron) because of both Walton and because they were so young."
Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel would have been a great if they could have signed him instead.
"If Booker turns into a megastar and they replace Paul with another star down the road, you can find a good defensive center for so much cheaper than a max though.  Like Lowe says it is near impossible to juggle 4 huge contracts unless you have an owner willing to go nuts in the tax.  Jarrett Allen, Mitch Robinson, clint Capella were late picks who contributed on cheap rookie deals. Nerlens Noel a d dwight howard are bouncing around the league on small deals. Nets replaced Allen with Claxton on another rookie deal.  If you have elite perimeter players, finding a big to just guard the rim and set picks is super cheap if you have the right system and scouting department in place.  Edit: I'm also not comparing Ayton as a complete player to those guys, just saying if you give Ayton a max he better be one of the best defenders in the league while being elite on offense or it isn't worth it, because you could get one or the other for 5 million"
"That's a fun thing to clown in retrospect, but really what I think it shows more than anything is drafting is really really hard, or even maybe really just a crapshoot when you get down to it.  Just look at where Curry, Giannis, Butler, Jokic (and by extension Anthony Bennet, Nerlens Noel, Jabari Parker, etc.) all got drafted, none of which except for Bennet were especially controversial at the time."
We wouldn't. Im just saying we have max cap space. I also wanted to say that if teams are looking for a cost effective rim protecter Nerlens is gonna be a UFA- replacing Ayton with Noel is a bad idea tho
"Rui,Gafford,Bertans and Matthews are all okay to good players. Their biggest problem has been the lack of rim protection.  I'd look into trading for Nerlens Noel if I was them tbh"
"Let the core grow. Nerlens Noel is a perfect compliment to Randall, and RJ has improving play making skills. It's a solid foundation for many years which only needs improving role players which require less assets."
"That's really not fair to the Thunder's role players. Sure they had no stars, but literally every one of their rotation players was probably an above average NBA player.  SGA, Schroeder, Gallo, Steven Adams were all above average starters at their position. And their bench had Nerlens Noel and Lu Dort too who are both showing how good they are this year too"
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4.

"draymond, nerlens noel, kyle anderson, isaiah stewart, moses brown*. (????)"
Nerlens Noel.
Nerlens Noel was only 3 assists and 1 steal from a 5x5.
"Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Nerlens Noel, Steve Novak (hey he shot pretty well don‚Äôt be shocked by this one)"
"Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes, Dwight Howard. Sixers legends"
he fucked up not signing the extension with the Rockets  Hope he doesnt end up as Nerlens Noel
"&gt; Oh and for the homer pick, Nerlens Noel is a huge reason why the Knicks have one of the best defenses in the league, but he's not gonna sniff an All-Defense Team sadly.  He's been more than admirable this season, just doesn't have the name recognition."
"Nerlens Noel, elite overall defense but in particular switching onto perimeter players, morale lowering blocks, steals and he's #2 in deflections in the league. He's a good passer and free throw shooter, who can occasionally hit a mid range shot. All that on 5M. If he were paired with a quality PG instead of Payton he would expect passes and PnR opportunities and look even better on like last season with Schroder and CP3."
"A lot of the Grizzlies other than Morant. JV, Melton, Brandon Clarke, etc. are all SOLID and are a big reason why they're above .500.  Richuan Holmes is having another year of being a solid starter and I haven't heard a peep about him.  Oh and for the homer pick, Nerlens Noel is a huge reason why the Knicks have one of the best defenses in the league, but he's not gonna sniff an All-Defense Team sadly."
"Gotta give the Thunder a decent amount of the credit on Grant and Noel, particularly Nerlens who looked like he was about to be out of the league after a not so great last year in Dallas"
Robert Covington. TJ McConnell. Nerlens Noel. Dario Saric. Jarami Grant. Michael Carter Williams. Christian Wood.
"They still could have. Giannis was drafted 15th overall, [this mock draft had him going 21st to the Jazz](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/5/22/4355884/nba-mock-draft-2013-nerlens-noel-cavaliers) There's a good chance that he either would have still been available at whatever slot Steph got them to or the Bucks could have traded up."
Tbh I think it would work well on defense. The Knicks roster rn doesn‚Äôt have any elite defenders besides MAYBE Nerlens Noel or Mitchell Robinson. As long as Demar tries like he has in San Antonio it can work.
"While Mitch is also a strong defender (especially in shot blocking), I think Noel is a stronger pure post defender. However, Mitch makes our offense much more dynamic since Nerlens is almost always a non-factor on the offensive side.  He is definitely missed but Nerlens and Taj have more than made up for his absence."
"Sure, man. You can have your opinion, and I can have mine. I think Tatum is overrated. I think Mitchell is underrated. Mitchell should get serious MVP consideration, and I doubt that will happen.  Tatum shouldn't.  Neither of us run NBA teams so it's moot.  Did Tatum (while certainly inexperienced himself) beat an inexperienced Sixers team and then a Raptors team who, whole defending champs, were minus their best player from their championship run to make the ECF twice? Yes.  Did Mitchell? No. He lost to the Harden Rockets twice and the Bubble Nuggets. By no means bad times, though understandable that last year seemed a bit of a bust at the time.  Ultimately, though, I think Denver was just much better than they were/are given credit for.  Sorry the Celtics lost so many games to injury. Ever heard the saying ""The best ability is availability""? We've certainly been lucky this season. Even the Mitchel Robinson injuries have been a blessing in disguise because they allowed Nerlens Noel to play a lot more and show his surprisingly high value.  Sorry my hot takes don't jive with your Celtics bias."
"Experience doesn‚Äôt equal production. Nerlens Noel of all people would body Deandre Jordan this isn‚Äôt 2014 nomore lol. In fact the second Knicks game, part of the reason the Knicks even snuck back is cause RJ Barrett etc was attacking DJ and walking to the paint in the 3rd  I think the point is pretty clear. Our defense increased dramatically when DJ did not play. That‚Äôs stats on this. Case closed"
"i dont see why we would overpay for robinson, I'd rather throw money at nerlens noel  Yeah I like mitch cause he is a homegrown talent at all, but he is the very definition of a one-way player.  Noel is a one way player too but a straight upgrade from robinson at that end  Sad because if he was like 10% quicker he would be an all-star caliber talent but he's just a little bit too slow"
Yeah for real he was on his way to nerlens noel type of contracts
Did you just compare Big Ben to Nerlens Noel?
"Gobert scores more, I'd say Nerlens Noel honestly"
Guard who can shoot of the dribble and a Nerlens Noel-type big.
-Andrew Wiggins after the Nerlens Noel incident
Nerlens ‚ÄúMidtown Pain Pig‚Äù Noel
"Nerlens ""NO L"" Noel."
"Nerlens Noel.   He‚Äôs always quietly been one of my favourite players because he‚Äôs underrated.  He‚Äôs a starting caliber C (and he proved it with the Knicks) but ever since he took that OKC role (because of Rich Paul) he‚Äôs been viewed as this weird Ed Davis bench guy when he‚Äôs so much better than that. This guy has 6th man potential on the bench and should be starting on a playoff team.  It‚Äôs very difficult to anchor a defence as a big, the whole foundation of it is dependent on you but Noel played a huge role for the Knicks getting them to be one of the best defences in the league.   His raw defensive stats his rookie year were really impressive too."
"Not exactly what you asked for, but Nerlens Noel vs Rich Paul in a scaffold/cage match would be intense."
Finally something spicy that is not Ben Simmons or Nerlens Noel
Fuck. You win this round. My only comeback is this: Nerlens Noel
Sixers. The type of franchise/type of reasons why agents have a fudiciary responsibility to protect their clients \[like Nerlens Noel\] from such predatory and dysfunctional employers.
"&gt; That's literally what I'm talking about.  It's a shame you're talking about shit you know nothing about, then.  &gt;Rich isn't the only agent at Klutch.  He was at the time. As of right now, Klutch has four agents. Rich Paul, Omar Wilks, Calvin Andrews and Lucas Newton. All three of them were hired *after* the Nerlens Noel debacle.   &gt;Did you seriously think Klutch was just Rich Paul and a couple of secretaries? Really?  Unlike you, I actually:  1. Know Rich Paul very well; and 2. Know what the fuck I'm talking about.  So to quote a famous poet; *bitch, be humble. Sit down.*"
"Like Nerlens Noel? He had no idea how to identify talent, just took who was mocked there."
It was very obvious to anyone who watched a single one of his college basketball games that Nerlens Noel was not worth a top 5 pick.
"&gt; Did he say ""minimum offer I'll consider is X""?  Me playing Devil‚Äôs Advocate for Rich Paul:  What if Nerlens to start getting FA calls started getting preliminary numbers around $30-40M, to which Rich Paul ignored because Nerlens told him ‚Äúno less than $50M‚Äù. By the time it was obvious to Noel that he was going to have to take less than desired, those teams revoked their offers to sign someone else.   I really find it hard to believe that Rich Paul actively didn‚Äôt answer his phone when the Lakers call him.   To me it feels like a campaign against Rich Paul, using Nerlens as a face of the attack."
Wasnt nerlens noel one of the early process picks they had high hopes for?
"For real.  The entire process was fucking ""BPA"" type picks.  Embiid, Nerlens Noel, Okafor were their three first round aquisitions in a row at one point.  I even got downvoted in the Knicks subreddit for shitting on them mid-process.    Now they got Morey absolutely shitting the bed here.  He's become a walking meme. What a mess"
[Nerlens Noel is currently suing Rich Paul for loss in potential salary](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32079344/new-york-knicks-nerlens-noel-sues-rich-paul-klutch-claiming-loss-58m-potential-salary)
Still sad we barely got a taste of Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor together :(
Lol same for me up until 22. I get Whiteside. Then I get Dr. J after Steph. Nerlens Noel after Blake. Robinson instead of Olynyk. Iverson after CP3. Apparently I got a few more than you because everything else is the same lol
"Hinkie‚Äôs plan was fully realized, though. This sub just loves to romanticize him. His whole plan was just suck so much you get a ton of high picks, and then hope you luck out into cornerstone/franchise players.   The guy drafted Embiid, nice. He also drafted Nerlens Noel. Exactly as the Process intended."
"Yeah, I am of the opinion the next CBA needs to reign in what agents can do.  They effectively commit tortious interference with contracts when they do stuff like this.  The Nerlens Noel suit outcome will be very interesting in that regard."
"Obviously New York is not a small market, but I live in Tarrytown where the Knicks have their practice facility about 40 minutes outside the city. Kevin Knox and Mitchell Robinson came to get bbq at the place I worked not long after they were drafted. I gave them free biscuits! I credit mitch‚Äôs unexpecteded rise to those biscuits (let‚Äôs just not talk about Knox tho) Lol and I also saw Kyle oQuinn getting bagels once. Someone I have on Snapchat just posted a picture of nerlens noel out to brunch."

"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tom√°≈° Satoransk√Ω / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
"People overrate how big of a reach he was.  The top like 6-8 players were all viewed as interchangeable more or less.  The closest thing to consensus 1 was Nerlens and he even fell to #6.  Dipo was viewed as a ‚Äúsafe-ish‚Äù top 3 pick with higher floor and low ceiling.   On paper his upside is intriguing.  Elite rebounder who can stretch the floor.  Bennett, Oladipo, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller, Alex Len, Nerlens Noel, Ben McLemore was your top 7  Basically everyone high lottery was fucked in some way"
Giannis Steph Butler Booker PJ Tucker Cam Johnson Ja Morant Joe Ingles Alex Caruso Reggie Bullock Nerlens Noel OG Anounby idk defense

"Jrue Holiday, Bradley Beal, KD, Lebron, Clint Capela‚Ä¶.    7 man Bench would be TJ Mcconel, KCP, Jae Crowder, Thaddeus Young, Nerlens Noel, Javale Mcgee and Seth Curry"
"It was a horrible draft pick obviously but that draft was notoriously bad. There was no clear number 1, if I recall before the draft most had Nerlens Noel going 1st but he tore his acl so his stock dropped. People like Otto Porter Jr, Alex Len and Cody Zeller were in the top 5.   To me, what‚Äôs worse is when you have a strong draft and you passed on an obvious option to take a guy you thought had more potential, like Bagley or Flynn"
Nerlens Noel is another one
Nerlens Noel will be requesting a trade to the Clippers upon hearing this.
Nerlens Noel
"People clowned on Noel too until it was blamed on his agent not taking calls from teams offering him that money, people clowned on Oladipo until he got hurt then it just seemed mean to clown on a dude for betting on himself then getting hurt instead of just shitting the bed like Schroder or being screwed over like Nerlens."
He certainly doesn‚Äôt work for Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel in shambles
Nerlens Noel in shambles.
"Don't let this distract you from the fact that people think LeBron ""instructed"" Rich Paul to sabotage Nerlens Noel from signing with the Clippers or Sixers because it would make it too competitive for LeBron to handle.  &amp;#x200B;  \*cough\* Clippers fans"
"If I told you we once had a GM who compiled a team of: Embiid, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Dario Saric, TJ McConnell, Covington, Christian Wood, plus a ton of upcoming firsts and pick swaps, only to be pushed out by Big Collar....."
Dennis is gonna continue to catch strays. It‚Äôs not like a Nerlens Noel situation. The initial contract was an overpay and everyone knew it. Dude thinks he‚Äôs way better than he is.
Nerlens Noel dropped because of injury concerns - medical records that the teams had access to but pundits didn't.  Is there anyone who dropped 18 picks btw? Just wondering.
" &gt; it's actually possible that they could've still picked Bennett 19th overall.  Bullshit. Every mock draft had him top 10, most top 5  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/5/22/4355884/nba-mock-draft-2013-nerlens-noel-cavaliers"
Nerlens Noel says take the max
Nerlens noel
It‚Äôs Wiggins for me. He just quit dunking inexplicably. His last big one I remember he coulda killed Nerlens Noel
Great hands on defense. Check his steal numbers and passing deflections since he came in the league. He‚Äôs been one of the best if not the best next to Nerlens Noel
[As the great Nerlens Noel once tweeted](https://mobile.twitter.com/nerlensnoel3/status/1433226482361540608?s=21)
All because some dumb shit with Nerlens Noel.
I sometimes wonder if Rich Paul knows not all his clients can be handled as if they are LeBron James. Starting to question his capacity for being a real agent and not just a superfriend employee. The Nerlens Noel lawsuit is not a non issue and potentially speaks volumes. Morris twins and others have parted with Paul.
Lol tell that to Nerlens Noel
Sad Nerlens Noel noises
"&gt;Yeah they may be a 15 win team now  Well yes that's exactly my point. And if you want a more thorough reasoning of why I think he'll be limited for the near future, you can read through my response to another Orlando fan below. I like Isaac a lot, as a Sixers fan (as you gracefully pointed out) he reminds me of a Nerlens Noel with more offensive potential. It's just that the growth hasn't happened yet, so if he's going to be scoring on high volume it's not going to be on good efficiency or on a super competitive team"
"Tin Foil Hat Theory:   Ben wants to be in LA. Rich Paul wants him in LA. So they‚Äôve concocted and created this ridiculous off court drama to ‚Äúforce‚Äù the 76ers into getting rid of him.  Paul has a grudge with the Sixers because of the Nerlens Noel thing, which I‚Äôm sure he knew about before it was widely reported.  Ben is happy to play along because he just wants out of Philly. I might even go so far as to say that he‚Äôs been hiding his three point shooting and tanked the Hawks series to intentionally underperform in Philly."
"While I absolutely hate Rich Paul for how he treats his less tier clients primarily Nerlens Noel.   I honestly don't have any issues with players trying to force trades to the teams they want to go to.   Like Sports teams don't have any sense of loyalty. It's hey what can you do for me now if you can't do anything for me the good bye.   While Charles Barkley complains about Ben Simmons and Anthony Davis, look at what the Kings did with DeMarcus Cousins. Look at what Clippers did Blake Griffin. Look at Boston did with Isaiah Thomas.   Isaiah Thomas was headed towards getting at least $15-25 mil per contract with how well he was doing in Boston. And his teammates liked him too. Then Danny Ainge cold heartedly shipped him off to Cleveland and dude didn't help with Cleveland and lost out on a big extension.   So yeah I don't really mind players forcing their way to their chosen team if they have the ability too."
*Nerlens Noel has entered the chat*
What other client besides Nerlens Noel has come out with a story like this?
"TIL Rich Paul only has one client, Nerlens Noel.   Oh no, that's right. He has way more than that."
"Nerlens, Noel, and that other dude from the Knicks, Nerlens Noel. Three different players that Rich Paul fucked over? Wow, man is leaving a trail of devastation in his wake."
"So you're saying that this had nothing to do with Rivers and Embiid shitting on Simmons for underperforming. Yes they my have been right. But you don't shit on someone publicly and expect things to be dandy. The real problem here is that he underperformed and the team wants to trade him for not being a superstar, yet Daryl is demanding Super Star level returns for his trade. Imagine you are Ben Simmons, you have a team trading you because they don't think you are that good (and have publicly indicated this right after their loss), but are demanding other teams the price of a super star player. Maybe next time, Embiid and Doc Rivers need to learn to STFU and to not put their FO in the position they are in now.  But no, let's play Rich Paul out of left field, loosely brining up other things he's messed up (so far just Nerlens Noel), to somehow come up with a point?"
Noel and nerlens
&gt; who has mislead players and ruined several paydays for mid-level guys  name two not named Nerlens Noel (allegedly)   &gt; threatening the organization with other players who he happens to represent  This was proven to be false less than 24 hours after the story broke  Imagine writing a whole introductory paragraph about people making themselves look stupid just to say some totally unfounded nonsense lmao
"&gt;But it is a stupid argument. Rich Paul has an obligation to do what is best for his client, not a team.   I think Nerlens Noel is suing him because he doesn't do this."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32079344/new-york-knicks-nerlens-noel-sues-rich-paul-klutch-claiming-loss-58m-potential-salary%3Fplatform%3Damp  Allegedly didn‚Äôt report to Noel when teams were trying to offer him contracts. Potentially cost him almost 60m. Educate before hate little one.
"That was a great read, thanks for that.  100% agree about Noel. Hopefully the lawsuit can prove whether it happened and, if so, get Nerlens some reparations because damn."
It's not even really Rich Paul all that much nowadays. Ethan Sherwood Strauss had a great article on his substack the other day about Klutch and how it has changed.  https://houseofstrauss.substack.com/p/this-is-how-klutch-wins  Agents will do what they need to do to get their clients where they need to be. The ethical line is something that we all believe should be adhered to but not everybody follows the same principles. Rich Paul refusing to inform Nerlens Noel about contract offers where he could have earned generational wealth is negligence. Rich Paul limiting the market when it comes to Anthony Davis is a different story altogether.
"If there‚Äôs any truth to his negligence in handling Nerlens Noel free agency, then he‚Äôs a bad agent but he‚Äôs not this Lex Luther supervillain the media‚Äôs trying to play him and Lebron into, they‚Äôre literally just doing Agents 101"
 Are you Nerlens Noel agent
"NY Starting 5: Kemba, Evan, RJ, Julius, M Robinson(when fully healthy)  Bench: D üåπ, IQ, Burks, Obi, Nerlens Noel"
"Queta is a real good defender, I could see him playing that Nerlens Noel/Mitchell Robinson rim-runner role and being very effective. He/Holmes should give y'all some versatility at C."
"Rich Paul still works with NBA teams whereas Mino at times is straight up blocked from doing business with teams. However Mino operates solely in the best interests of his clients by doing whatever they need him to do even if that means going to an extreme. Mino pockets his fair share of transfer fees or commission off players but he seems to maintain good relations with his clients. Rich Paul seems kinda shady with how he and LeBron run Klutch and are in cahoots with bringing the whole NBA roster to LA. Mino may not be liked by teams or fan bases but that‚Äôs his role, he‚Äôs the guy you need to do your dirty work if you don‚Äôt wanna piss off your team staff or fans. I can‚Äôt say much to Rich Paul but given the Nerlens Noel situation it seems like he pisses off fans and clients too as he gives the perception that he only truly worries about his star clients whereas Mino will go to war for any client no matter how good they may be."
"No, everyone does business with Rich Paul and nobody inside NBA circles particularly gives a shit about his tactics lol. The people that care as far as we can tell are other agencies and Nerlens Noel."
Exactly! players still sign with the Celtics after Ainge supposedly spurned the agents with his kyrie/IT situation. Money talks unless you have rich Paul not accepting offers for Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel
"yeah, honestly, I think a huge part of this from me is that I'm mad that Rich Paul didn't do a good job representing Nerlens Noel (lol, seriously, I'm mad about that).  and that I'm mad Simmons has gotten too big for his britches. You can't do an AD/Harden-style demand to be traded after your 4th playing season -- you're not good enough for that."
"nerlens noel literally filed a lawsuit on the basis that brett brown told him they tried to reach out and couldn't. that's confirmation.  &gt; [Klutch declined to comment on the lawsuit, which also alleged that the agent did not take or return calls from teams interested in Noel, including the Philadelphia 76ers, with whom the center started his career. Noel asserted he learned that from former 76ers coach Brett Brown.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/knicks-nerlens-noel-sues-nba-agent-rich-paul-alleging-indifference-cost-him-millions/)  and  &gt; [The suit states that the Philadelphia 76ers reached out about a potential deal for Noel, but Paul wouldn‚Äôt respond. It also states that Paul ignored overtures from the Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Clippers.](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2021/8/25/22641113/nerlens-noel-rich-paul-klutch-sports-lawsuit-maverick-contract)  you don't just file a lawsuit because brett brown told you something if he didn't actually tell you something"
"No, they didn't.  &gt;76ers **reportedly** tried to get ahold of Nerlens Noel during the 2018 NBA offseason but Rich Paul refused to answer the team‚Äôs calls per ***DarrenHeitner***. Nerlens was notified of the situation after the fact by Brett Brown.  **Reportedly** is defined as  &gt;according to what some say (**used to express the speaker's belief that the information given is not necessarily true)**.  ""he was in El Salvador, reportedly on his way to Texas"""
Agents hate him because they‚Äôre jealous he‚Äôs taking over the league and front offices hate him because players are getting more power. He‚Äôs the best agent in the league whether you want to admit it or not. If he wasn‚Äôt a great agent then all these players wouldn‚Äôt keep signing there. You‚Äôre not using your brain at all. That Nerlens Noel case is going to go no where by the way.
Tbh I don't really care about this story about AD playing only with LeBron. That is just player empowerment and I'm all for it cause realistically if AD plays another year and gets a career altering injury the team wouldn't hesitate to low ball him offers I mean look at how Derrick Rose and Boogie Cousins career turned out. So this specific thing I don't really mind  What I do mind is what Rich Paul did to Nerlens Noel. Noel was close to signing Generational wealth. And this motherfucker Rich Paul tempts him with a $100 mil offer and then basically ghosts him. When it looked like teams were trying to get Noel for his services Paul wouldn't bother returning calls.   In the Noel situation I hope Rich Paul loses his Player Agent license. Dude fucked over Noel.
Did you miss every thread about Rich Paul screwing over Nerlens Noel? That was one of the biggest examples of incompetence and being unprofessional that I've ever seen from an agent
Nerlens Noel would disagree with your first sentence.
After he knocked out Nerlens Noel with a poster attempt it seems like he started playing timidly
Perk must of saw Nerlens Noel pulling up üò≥
"https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/rich-paul-ignored-clippers-calls-for-nerlens-noel  Also seems it‚Äôs not as simple as Noel turning some offers down. Reports recently from the potential lawsuit are that Paul was also literally ignoring calls from the Rockets and the Clippers and Noel didn‚Äôt even know until later.  This is just a conspiracy obviously, but he then ends up going to the Knicks in the East instead of a direct competitor to the Lakers like Houston or the Clippers."
"The thing is, nobody really cares about Nerlens Noel just like no one cares about Kyle Kuzma"
"Yeah except those assets weren't in any way shape or form moveable.   It turns out having 5 centers and being desperate to offload them doesn't give you much leverage on the market.  &gt; especially if MCW, Noel were flipped at the right time for the right future assets.  Hinkie was the guy who traded MCW. He got a protected future 1st that turned into #14 in 2019... So he turned pick #11 into pick #14.  Hinkie was also the reason Nerlens and Okafor **weren't** traded at the right time. He was the one who held onto them for too long. Within a year of taking over, Colangelo had traded Nerlens and tried to trade Okafor, but by then their market value had tanked.  Teams offered Hinkie a haul for Okafor and by the time Colangelo had stepped in he wasn't even worth a 1st round pick.  &gt;didn‚Äôt get caught up in sunk cost, getting attached to players who needed to be moved (like overholding Fultz while his value dwindled).  Lol..."
Nerlens Noel draft day trade.
Nerlens Noel? It was a draft day trade that saw Jrue Holiday going to the Pelicans.   Hinkie wasn't some savant GM.
He would have to know that Lakers nor Clippers have the pieces to trade for him. So he has to know Sac is his next spot. Lets him sit this yr and see if something happens with an injury to another team and then trade his ass. He has no leverge thats why Rich wants Maxey outta Philly as well. Hope after the Nerlens Noel situation he (Maxey) does whats best for him. Look Mad Max was a gift from the BBall God. I really hope and pray Daryl don't screw this up.
Nerlens Noel is really handsome so I could see it
"Not really? All I said is that, if it‚Äôs true that the first report was false, he‚Äôs still an untrustworthy agent because of the Nerlens Noel thing, which there is plenty of readily available information on. The fact that we ***know*** what he did in regards to that situation makes me unwilling to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Mind you, all of this is coming from someone who regularly defended Rich Paul, especially with the AD stuff, because he did *exactly* what a good agent should do. Prior to the Noel situation, I considered Rich Paul to be the best agent in basketball. If it weren‚Äôt for that new information about him and his actions and the way he treated a non-star player, I wouldn‚Äôt think this way of him.  It‚Äôs not about a bias, it‚Äôs about a logical assessment of known information."
"Wtf I'm a Nerlens Noel fan now?  I know it won't happen, but Silver should really bring the hammer down on Rich Paul. It's bad for the league, and there's really no reason not to go after him."
Rich literally was supposed to tell Nerlens about offers. He was receiving calls from the Sixers and others probably and he just ignored them  That's not on Noel
"Hinkie drafted MCW, Nerlens Noel, and Jahlil Okafor all high in the lottery.  Definitely some rose colored glasses when 76er fans talk about that man.  He wasn‚Äôt bad but he was definitely somewhere around average."
ESPN: What does this mean for LeBron‚Äôs relationship with Nerlens Noel?
"&gt;The weird thing people only do with rich paul is think he tells the client want to do and not the other way around   To be fair to those people, that's almost exactly the basic premise of the Nerlens Noel lawsuit - that Rich Paul got him to not take the Mavs' offer and then didn't do any work for Nerlens by being available to hear other offers. I'm not saying that's correct, just that someone is actively trying to argue that in a lawsuit, not just in reddit comments."
"This sounds like some stale PR ass covering. I‚Äôm actually surprised more people aren‚Äôt calling it BS in this thread, especially when you see the Nerlens Noel stuff and some of the other rumors about how Rich Paul treats his non-star clients."
"It doesn‚Äôt really change my mind about the Nerlens Noel thing or the other instances of him neglecting his non-star players, but, I mean, yeah, if it didn‚Äôt happen then why would it still factor in to my opinion?  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this was him covering his ass, as it totally sounds like something he would do, but, that‚Äôs definitely good for Maxey if he doesn‚Äôt want to get sent out with Ben Simmons. He‚Äôs set to basically be their starter depending on who they get back for Simmons."
Like...... Nerlens Noel?
"I would imagine there are sets of rules and practices that you have to follow, even if certain circumstances come up.  Even if the agent screws up or ignores a team, if the team tries to bypass that process they could catch heat from the NBAPA, the agent's lawyers, etc.  Plus then you risk not being able to work with other agents if they think you'll just bypass them. It's probably not worth that potential headache for Nerlens Noel.    The team probably had multiple players they were considering.  They didn't reach Paul, so they moved on and signed someone else."
"Tinfoil Hat Theory:  Simmons is gaming the system under the direction of Rich Paul.  Paul has a grudge because the Sixers outed his indifference to Nerlens Noel. Paul had made it clear he wants all his clients out of Philly.  I think Simmons intentionally tanked the playoffs and has escalated the rift so as to give him an excuse to go play in LA, young socialite that he is.  This is a little too much power in the hands of players and agents. Sixers are getting manipulated badly here."
"Kidd drama was definitely ridiculous, but nothing compares to the stupid absurdity of the Sixers.  in recent history we had league intervention to remove our GM and install Jerry Colangelo who hired his son, who proceeded to tweet against the players and leak medical info. then we hired a player who was literally on the team a year and a half prior to replace him, who was then replaced a year later, but remained with the team still.   We had a #1 pick who has mentally refused to shoot, followed by a #1 pick who forgot how to shoot after being drafted.   We lost on a historic buzzer beater, had intentions to ‚Äúrun it back‚Äù, but Butler wanted out so we trade him, and decide a great option would be to sign an aging center to replace him.   Then there‚Äôs smaller absurdities: Okafor punching Boston fans (lol), Okafors dad threatening to ‚Äúslap the shit‚Äù out of fans on Twitter, KJ McDaniels mom going on tirades against the team and trying to force a trade, JJ Redicks human trafficking taxi run-in, JJ Redicks Chinese racism slip-up incident, Embiids facemask saga against the Heat, Ben Simmons vs Dudley beef, Nerlens Noel sueing Rich Paul because he denied our call, Zhaire Smith developing a sudden sesame allergy and legitimately nearly dying after post-practice meal.   Tons more but just off the top of my head. This franchise is a roller coaster with nonstop weirdness."
"If you consider yourself a fan of the NBA, you know who Nerlens Noel is..."
LeBron was going up against arguably the most stacked team of all time and here's this guy trying to sell us on Nerlens Noel being the difference maker for the Clippers or Sixers lol
RP screwed over a Black man named Nerlens Noel. Please get your head out of your ass and start actually looking at the facts and what hurts and doesn't hurt Black people.
"They also had Nerlens Noel who had been taken at 6th the year before too which likely further discouraged it.   Then in 2015 they drafted Okafor who debuted the same season as Jokic, so even if they had picked him there‚Äôs a good chance he doesn‚Äôt become the player he is today unless Brett Brown has the balls to give him a meaningful amount of minutes in a center rotation with recent 6th and 3rd picks that the team still obviously would‚Äôve had hope for."
Steven Adams signing is a dumb dumb move. They could have just signed Okafor or Nerlens Noel for the minimum and get the same production. I am sure there are other avenues to trade Jrue than taking Bledsoe on.
"The list of available centers this offseason isn't great; Daniel Theis (plenty of teams will be bidding for him), Nerlens Noel (not bad, but is more of a backup than starter), Richaun Holmes (great offensively, poor defender) and from there it gets worse and worse.  They could also draft a center (I'm high on Kai Jones) but centers take a few years to develop and as I mentioned, the clock is already ticking with LaMelo in today's NBA. Sabonis, for all of his flaws, is an All-Star level talent that Charlotte can immediately surround him with."
"Both of those have proven to be the correct judgements given that both guys would have left.   Just like when Celtics fans were mocked for not wanting to trade the Tatum and Brown picks with Smart and Crowder to pair Demarcus Cousins with IT. And the same package for Kevin Love.    Or when they didn't want to trade Smart and the Brown pick for Okafor and Nerlens Noel.   Celtics fans have been mocked for ""over valuing"" these guys but now they have two of the best, most valuable, young wings in the NBA."
"It‚Äôs not illegal or immoral. You guys are acting like we sacrificed puppies and kittens for picks. The thunder aren‚Äôt going to get lebron, Bosh, or jimmy butler in free agency or S&amp;T. Our only hope for a player like that is to tank. Our best free agent signings in franchise history is probably Nerlens Noel. Also do you think the rockets and pistons were trying to win every game?"
"It wouldn‚Äôt be everything. It‚Äôd be all the young guys.   I used tradeNBA quick, and the Knicks would still have plenty of money to sign a guy like DeMar DeRozen and a bench big like Daniel Theis, before they re-sign their RFA‚Äôs (Rose, Reggie Bullock, Nerlens Noel, and Alec Burks).   A starting lineup of:   Dame, Reggie Bullock, DeRozen, Randle, and Noel.   With a bench of:  Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, and Daniel Theis  Isn‚Äôt horrible. Dame, DeRozen, Randle, and Rose can all score and the rest of guys can create a pretty strong defense. Of course, the Knicks would have to have a good free agency, but getting Dame would probably help convince guys like DeRozen to sign."
"Immanuel Quickley, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel"
"Dame, Reggie Bullock, FA (Maybe DeRozan?), Julius Randle, and Nerlens Noel wouldn‚Äôt be a harrible starting lineup. Especially with Derrick Rose and Alec Burks off the bench.   That‚Äôd leave the trailblazers with RJ Barrett, Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, Immanuel Quickley, and future picks which would be a decent offer all things considered. I‚Äôd rather have RJ Barrett than Ben Simmons.   The Knicks might even be able to hold onto one of Quickly or Toppin, depending on what other teams offer."
"If that‚Äôs the package then I hope we give up all our picks this year besides our lottery pick (16,18,34,36,55) and like 4 or five more future picks and just say fuck the tank.  I think a lineup of Dame, SGA, Dort, Scottie, and FA Center X (Jarrett Allen, Nerlens Noel??) could be solid.  Consolidate our picks further next summer for the next unhappy star that comes around"
"That's fair. I would probably choose Young over Lavine and Ayton over Kevin Love.  Hell, give me Julius Randle over Kevin Love.   There's actually a long list of bigs I'd take over Kevin Love. I don't actually think he's one of the top 20 big men in the league. The majority of teams have a 4 or 5 better than him. I don't think I'm crazy in thinking that Nerlens Noel would be more useful. Or Brook Lopez, Blake Griffin, Jae Crowder...literally just random roleplaying guys about 6'8"" or so."
"Heck, Nerlens Noel would be more useful than Love out there."
"I always felt that a condition of the trade from Portland's end would be moving on from nurkic to a more athletic center, allowing them to play a more aggressive scheme defensively.  They would need their 5 man to either be a lob threat or a stretch 5. Nerlens Noel would fit quite nicely provided Portland could also find some extra scoring in the backcourt, from either Simons or another floor spacing guard of a similar type. I think there's also hope that Zach Collins could be an ideal fit next to Simmons, but his injury history is really stacking up.  It's hard to project what Ben could do in a Dray role because he's never played on a team with a guard that demanded attention like Dame. People are very low on him now but it wouldn't take a ton of improvement for him to absolutely dominate the 4v3 situations that Dame generates."
Nerlens Noel?
Then the solution is telling KD to try harder not benching him for Nerlens Noel lmao
"No one else in the league would have even tried to contest that. Well, at least no other superstar. Maybe a rim protector who doesn‚Äôt play a large role on the other end, like Nerlens Noel or something?   But I don‚Äôt see even AD or Embiid even trying to come back and contest that dunk, much less block it."
"So the roster right now could've conceivably been:  **PG:** Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell.   **SG:** Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton.   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Jerami Grant.   **PF:** Jayson Tatum, Robert Covington, Dario Saric.   **C:** Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I'd assume you turn a lot of those assets into a star to start at the 2 in that team, like...I don't know...Jimmy Butler?"
"I still cannot believe Nerlens Noel turned down a 4 yr/$70 million contract.  Goddamn, son."
"That Markell Fultz, Ben Simmons, Nerlens Noel, and Zhaire Smith super team potential"
"What about all the assets hinkie squandered...?  Trading a 23 year old all star PG for picks that turned into... Mcw and nerlens noel?  Drafting Okafor over Porzingis, when you already just drafted Embiid?   I swear I'll never understand how people convinced themselves that Hinkie was some sort of elite GM."
Nerlens noel with ability to just sit there and protect the rim
"It would be really fun to bring role players who actually fit the team. Like, for superstars, a gold medal is just another piece of their Hall of Fame resume. It would be fun to see role players get to add medals to their careers because it would be a huge achievement for them. Like, ""Nerlens Noel - Olympic Gold Medalist,"" playing key minutes off the bench as a rim-protector, just sounds more exciting than, like, ""oh, LeBron has two golds? Good for him.""  And you're totally right. Whenever a Team USA team has a bad showing, all that happens is that everyone puts more pressure on superstars to play next time, and then they do, and then it's a slow decline to the next disappointment.  I'm a proud and grateful American and everything, but I always root for the other countries in basketball because it'd be way more fun for it to become a genuinely competitive tournament where Team USA has to get their shit together and not just send out whatever all-stars are free and willing that year."
"All truth. Problem is, if that something is Detroit plumlee do you pull the trigger? What about nerlens noel? Its not gonna be a dollar to dollar equivalent... it doesn't have to be when you have steph klay dray either"
"The crazy thing about Robert Williams aside from being an advanced stats darling, or his stellar passing especially throwing lobs to others, ability to change the trajectory of almost anyone's shot, and change the time continuum. He's consistently one of the best shot blockers in the game.  He's ranked 9th in the league with 91 blocks per game.  This was something I'm always in awe of, because I was looking at his statistics on BBall-Reference two days ago, and he's ahead of players like Embiid, Giannis, and Jarrett Allen. All players well known for their defensive capabilities/weakside or shot blocking help.  And he's done this in 985 minutes.  |1. Rudy Gobert|2187 MPG|190 blocks| |:-|:-|:-| |2. Myles Turner|1455 MPG|159 blocks| |3. Nerlens Noel|1547 MPG|141 blocks| |4. Clint Capela|1898 MPG|129 blocks| |5. Jakob Poeltl|1845 MPG|123 blocks| |6. Chris Boucher|1453 MPG|111 blocks| |7. Brook Lopez|1902 MPG|103 blocks| |8. Richaun Holmes|1782 MPG|96 blocks| |9. Robert Williams|985 MPG|91 blocks| |18. Giannis Antetokounmpo|2013 MPG|73 blocks| |21. Joel Embiid|1585 MPG|69 Blocks|  What a freakin' beast. If the dude could just stay healthy, he makes us that much better as a team for real."
"On the Knicks, sure. We're probably losing Nerlens Noel if we're not going to overpay."
"Damn, did he really give up cash? Any ideas of the rumored deals he turned down?  Players need to look at Nerlens Noel whenever they want to take a big discount early in their career."
College Karl Anthony towns and Devin Booker and along with their 8 other NBA draftees is beating Nerlens Noel and MCW and whoever G league players left they had on their roster.
"If Lowry leaves, use the cap space created to pursue Jarrett Allen or Richaun Holmes.  If Lowry stays, use an exception to pursue a cheaper option, like Nerlens Noel.  Using our exceptions to sign a shooting wing like OPJ or Bullock would be nice too."
&gt;I feel like Mobley has the higher bust potential than Green but a higher ceiling.  I feel the opposite. I feel like Deandre Ayton right now is basically Mobley's floor. Green's floor is being an inconsistent scorer with poor enough defense to get relegated to the bench.   &gt;he‚Äôs essentially just Nerlens Noel  He's already a better defender than Noel.
I feel like Mobley has the higher bust potential than Green but a higher ceiling. Green has the all around scoring ability that I think he can at least be a good scoring wing but he might never develop the defence and playmaking to make him elite  Mobley‚Äôs got rare skills for a big as he‚Äôs very mobile and can handle the ball decently. Problem is if he can‚Äôt fill out his frame and develop a reliable jumper he‚Äôs essentially just Nerlens Noel with better handles. If he can develop the strength to battle inside with NBA bigs and a shot he‚Äôll be legitimately elite.
"gold like markelle fultz, nerlens noel, and ben simmons  but james harden aint worth that i guess"
"Kuzma's hustle is nice but not after he negates all his hard work with bone headed plays.  Kuzma is a sieve on defense makes Andre Drummond look like a future DPOY candidate.  Kuzma is not just on defensive assignments he is thoroughly embarrassed. MPJ cooked him multiple possessions in a row in the year of the title run.  Plus dont get it twisted, Drummond is out for his next big deal and will be putting effort.  I just dont see who the Lakers can sign besides Drummond to back up AD.   Here are the Lakers most realistic options for free agents. Gasol/Trez was a terrible replacement for Dwight/McGee. They need a quality back up C to eat up minutes for AD.  Here are the top free agents for the Lakers: Nerlens Noel, Cody Zeller, Kanter, Whiteside  **Zeller** - 27 years old - 9 pts /7 rebounds/ 2 assists on the Hornets in 20 minutes  **Noel** - 27 years old - 5 pts/6 rebounds/2 blocks on the Knicks in 25 minutes   **Whiteside** - 32 years old - 8 pts/6 rebounds/1 block on the Kings in 15 minutes  **Drummond** - 27 years old - 12 pts/7 rebounds/ 1 block on the Lakers in 25 minutes  Besides Noel (and maybe Whiteside although he only was asked to play 15 minutes a game on the Kings) who else can the Lakers go after?  Only way the Lakers arent bringing Drummond back is if he asks for some ungodly amount of money."
"Nerlens Noel or Larry Nance Jr would be great. Simmons at the 4 would also be a great fit and would most likely have to be a 3 team deal in which the Sixers get Lowry, the Raptors get Rubio, Beasley and some picks and the Wolves get Simmons. There would probably have to be some more picks and fillers to make it work, but I think everyone benefits from this trade."
We don't need much. I'm gonna say Nerlens Noel to bolster our defense and we'd be set
"For the GOAT defensive center, Nerlens Noel, I believe"
"Yeah, I do. Players aren‚Äôt always very smart - look at Nerlens Noel turning down $70m from Dallas, LeBron pandering to China, or Isaiah Thomas playing through his hip injury.  Also it‚Äôs funny how you‚Äôre shitting on the Kings now when it fits your argument"
&gt;Maybe if you have 3 a la the Nets. Two plus poor spacing/zero rim protection doesn‚Äôt cut it. It‚Äôs hard to even have a top 10 defense without decent rim protection  They could literally get a Nerlens Noel type of big and solve that issue for very cheap.
I wonder if Dort regrets taking his contract as much as Nerlens Noel regrets not taking his.
Shocked no one has mentioned Nerlens Noel not taking the bag from Dallas.  Man has been underpaid for last few years and it all goes back to not taking the bag.
"A backup ball handler, a shooter(or two) if THJ isn't re-signed, and a versatile, athletic rim running center.   My wish list looks something like dinwiddie, nerlens noel/richaun holmes and maybe like a one year deal for danny green or something."
"Nets: The big three with prime Blake, DJ, Aldridge, healthy Spencer Dinwiddie, prime Jeff Green, Joe Harris Heat Tyler Johnson, Knicks Shumpert(if not waived), Thunder Andre Roberson(if not waived).  Clippers: Kawhi, PG, Boogie, Rondo, Ibaka, Batum, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Zubac, Pistons Kennard, Mavericks Yogi Ferrell.  Lakers: LeBron, Pelicans AD, Marc Gasol, Drummond, Harrell, Wesley Matthews, Schroder, Kuzma, Suns Markieff Morris, Pistons KCP, Suns Jared Dudley, Kings Ben McLemore.  76ers: Prime Dwight, Embiid, Simmons, Tobias, Spurs Danny Green, Pacers George Hill, Milton, Warriors Anthony Tolliver.

"See: Jason Kidd, Rajon Rondo, Luka Doncic, Nerlens Noel, Chandler Parsons, Samuel Dalembert, Jae Crowder (not sure if they actively clashed, but Carlisle horribly underutilized him), Deshawn Stevenson, etc."
You're probably right. Shabazz Muhammad and Nerlens Noel were the darling of that year until age/injuries happened.
"Even the Cavs owner wanted Victor Oladipo, and most draft boards had Nerlens Noel as the #1 before he went down with injury.  Who the fuck thought drafting Bennett at #1 was a good idea"
And it was Nerlens Noel 3 years ago. He was one foot pit of the league until he got healthy and accepted he was never going to be anything but a role player.
He did get Nerlens Noel to take one with OKC
"Yes, the Knicks have been poorly run for a long time. But last season, Fiz started 4-18, was fired, and then the Knicks' G-League coach took over and posted a 17-27 record the rest of the season, with the same roster. If the blame was all on the Knicks and their roster construction, then there's no way Fiz has an 18% winning percentage and his replacement a 39% winning percentage.    Fiz says all the right things about coaching defense when talking to the press. But, like you, I also have no idea what his X's and O's are, because I didn't see any. The Knicks were the 26th-ranked defense in the NBA his one full season in NY. Tom Thibodeau took mostly the same roster from Fiz's last season and made them a top 3 NBA defense -- there was no drastic roster shakeup. The big additions were Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks, Derrick Rose, and Immanuel Quickley.  I just think Fiz has some serious work ahead of him to rebuild his reputation."
Bahamian Bro's sticking together while Everett legend Nerlens Noel catches a full load from his own backyard
Schroder is about to live that Nerlens Noel life.
it doesn‚Äôt help that ayton has nerlens noel level hands half the time he‚Äôs out there but yes i generally agree it would be smart to feed him
More like Nerlens Noel turning down 70 million then a young small forward coming off two great years on a playoff team. But kudos you make a legitimate point since Porter wasn't drafted by Washington.
Nerlens Noel turned down 4/72m
Ehrm...  Nerlens Noel 2.0 incoming?
"I also want $100M-$120M in free agency, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm getting it either, Denny.  Enjoy your Nerlens Noel level cock-up, buddy."
Remember when Nerlens Noel turned down 70 million? Or when Latrell Sprewell said that he has a family to feed?
Yeah that‚Äôs true. Idk I have a feeling he‚Äôs gonna Nerlens Noel himself
This guy is really gonna be the next Nerlens Noel and miss out on a fat contract huh
"If I had a choice between Nerlens Noel on his contract vs Rudy on his contract, I honestly think I might lean towards Noel. While a player like Rudy does raise your floor, he also make it impossible to truly compete for titles. I think with the extra cap space saved, you could more them make up for Rudy's floor rasing while also creating a more viable playoff team. The real problem is nobody wants to sign with small market teams, but that's a whole other discussion."
"Danny Green to the Knicks along with Dame in a trade and DeMar as a free agent. Trading Barrett, Quickley, Toppin, Robinson and picks for Dame. Then bring back some of the role players on team-friendly deals:  Damian Lillard, Danny Green, DeMar DeRozan, Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel.   Luca Vildoza, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Kevin Knox, Taj Gibson."
Nerlens Noel betting on himself lol
"Elfrid Payton and Nerlens Noel!  Elfrid Payton will always make sure he's not a huge scorer for you.  I was so excited for him at the beginning of the season when he was hitting shots, like when we blew out the Bucks."
"Randle, Jarret Allen, and Myles Turner (if healthy) would all be better big man fits for Team USA than washed up KLove and they have all played for Team USA before.   Nerlens Noel and Richaun Holmes were also born in the states, but I couldn‚Äôt find any record of them playing for Team USA before at any level."
If you really wanted to make a more balanced team you‚Äôd try to trade Joe Harris for a legitimate rim protector. KD/Kyrie/Harden is more than enough scoring. Y‚Äôall need some defence to be more balanced. Maybe a sign and trade with Nerlens Noel.
"""Derrick Rose will come back before Nerlens Noel gets drafted""  I lold. I forgot Derrick Rose comeback memes were a thing"
"He's a deluxe rim runner / defense guy, but the big question is can he be worth 25 million more than like Nerlens Noel or Zubac?  I'd really love to see him add a post game that would protect him from being played off the floor by a team like the non-injury clippers. And by the way, can the Suns go 5 out against a team like Utah if Ayton is on a max?  Last point: I don't like giving centers maxes when they aren't true superstars because it causes roster construction problems relative to low cost options.   Ultimately he will get the max because at least one team will be willing to give it to him, but I think he's more like a 20 million player."
Is Nerlens Noel any good at all?
"Michael Carter Williams, Nerlens Noel, Ben Simmons, Dario Saric, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz, Evan Turner, Joel Embiid....   God this team's drafting was not great under Hinkie."
Hes probably just above mid level honestly.  Max is a huge reach. Nerlens noel and dennis schroeder level reach
"Nerlens Noel too. I know a lot of fans are probably content with getting a decent role player out of the top 10, but for us OKC fans we desperately want the Ying to SGAs Yang. So Unfortunately for the draft pick, it's either a Lillard type player or Busts to us. Especially since we can get role players later in the draft with how many picks we have."
Liked him on the Jazz. But also here is a list of #6 picks from all drafts that currently still have an active player:  Onyeka Okongwu  Jarrett Culver  Mo Bamba  Jonathan Isaac  Buddy Hield  Willie Cauley-Stein  Marcus Smart  Nerlens Noel  Damian Lillard  Jan Vesely  Ekpe Udoh  Jonny Flynn  Danilo Gallinari  Yi Jianlian  Brandon Roy  Martell Webster  Josh Childress  Chris Kaman  Dajuan Wagner
&gt;Thunder and Bucks are literally bottom 4 in market size and have had notable FA signings recently.  Who lol? Okc's best free agent signing is probably Nerlens Noel and that was after a disaster year in Dallas
"It‚Äôs insane you guys had 5 straight top 6 picks (two #1, two #3 and #6) and took Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz with 4 of them. Embiid was a huge win but man that is a brutal group of 4."
"He probably does the same thing once he sees that Trae Young is the superstar he's looking for. Remember he got booted before he even got to see Embiid play, as well as evaluate what he has in Simmons. The best players during his time were Nerlens Noel &amp; Jahlil Okafor, who are now backup C's at best."
Did I misread this? Presti is incredible and our free agency woes have nothing to do with him but we have never had any great free agents sign here. Look back and see who our best free agent signings are I think it‚Äôs probably Nerlens noel or someone else similar to his calibre
What else are we supposed to do? Our best free agent signing is probably Nerlens Noel or Anthony Morrow
Nerlens Noel averaged 2 blocks and a steal on the minimum
"Zero, you sign the max and force the trade.  Even if he wants out the Pelicans give him the max because it elevates his trade value.  Not only that but an injury in that last year or poor play means literal truckloads of money lost.  Nerlens Noel is the cautionary tale to bear in mind."
"Nerlens Noel gave up $70M to sign a one year tender for like $4M and took his chances as an UFA the next year, didn‚Äôt go well"
"Okafor, Nerlens Noel, MCW... How about trading away bridges on draft night? That one really hurt. Hometown kid went to hometown School his mom works for the hometown NBA team, yeah sure ship them off to the West Coast."
This is one of the more extreme examples but I'd 100% rather have Nerlens Noel than Drummond.
"I think you should just accept that there is no improving with him. [Even LSU's beat writer had a scouting report pre-draft](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/philadelphia-76ers/not-worthy-no-1-lsu-reporter-details-concerns-ben-simmons ) that just matches what we see of him today.  &gt;""To me, he's more of a specialist player and a complementary player than someone who can really take over a team,"" Guilbeau said. ""He's not a strong, inside player like a brute. A physical player. And he also does not shoot from the outside, which is amazing, but he's a great passer and a great scorer.""  &gt;Complementary player? Can't take over a team? Say what?  &gt;""I don't think he should be the first pick,"" Guilbeau said. ""I can see him being a high first-round pick. It depends on the team he's going to. Do they have enough of the other parts of the team where he can be a facilitator and a complementary player?  &gt;""He would have to go to a team where he can flourish as a complementary player, a team that has a very good center.""  &gt;The Sixers are loaded in the front court with Jahlil Okafor, Nerlens Noel and potentially Joel Embiid. But a first overall pick is not supposed to be a complementary player.  &gt;""I think you could develop him to be as good as he could be, but not be that type of star,"" Guilbeau said. ""It's kind of strange to me. Before he ever played he was supposed to be the greatest player, and I just never saw it. I covered great players here like Shaquille O'Neal and Chris Jackson, and he just didn't change a team like those guys did."""
"What makes you think he refuses to work on his game?  You don't know that.  I think he has a mental problem right now and might really be trying his hardest to overcome it.  And saying a teammate is wasting someone's prime is ridiculous. No one owes Embiid anything.  Plus he's hurt all the time.  Maybe Ben Simmons' prime is being wasted by a slow, out of shape and injured Embiid  who gave up 3 full court easy dunks in the 4th quarter and let Collins and Capela slip by him for 3 offensive rebounds late in the game. Plus they've had two bad coaches in a row.  Maybe those coaches are wasting Ben's prime.  Plus they drafted Markelle Fultz, Nerlens Noel, and Jalhil Okafor.  Maybe the GMs wasted their prime. Quit blaming other people for your misery."
"The #1 pick was going to be Nerlens Noel until he hurt his knee.  After that, the Cavs wanted to make a push for the playoffs that year, and already were backlogged at the Guard position (Kyrie/Waiters), plus the PF/Center positons (Tristan Thompson, Anderson Varejao, Andrew Bynum), so they wanted someone who could fill the SF slot, and with how much a crapshoot the rest of the draft was, it made moderate sense to reach on him to fill a need.  He was going to be a lottery pick, so it wasn't a huge reach, but he turned out worse than anyone could've expected."
"&gt;Maybe 1 yr tanking is ok and multi year tanking will prove to be pointless / damage culture too much / damage fan base too much  The multiple years of tanking is how they acquired Embiid and Simmons in the first place. I don't think the 76ers got knocked out because of a damaged culture of fanbase  If you tank for only one year you end up with just one shot, it may not work out. If the 76ers tanked for just one year they would have been trying to build around Nerlens Noel  The Wolves tanked once and they got KAT, but that's not enough. The King's got Bagley, which hasn't worked out. The Bucks got Jabari and were lucky they had Giannis develop. The Pelicans took AD, but then didn't stay down so didn't have any other young talented players. The Hornet's ended up with MKG  The league is littered with teams who didn't understand their own timeline and tried to compete too early. If you tank multiple years, you maximize your chance of getting that franchise star and the assets with them"
"He was only here for 2.5 years.    All his picks had value and would have been traded for more value if allowed.  Some were.     Draft 1 Noel - consensus #1.    BC held onto him too long.  Mostly due to elective surgery Nerlens got   MCW- traded for future pick, Mikal Bridges.  Again, subsequent GM couldn‚Äôt convert the layup and just take the hometown kid  Draft 2   Embiid - MVP candidate  Dario- half of Butler trade.  Again future GM messed it up.    Also picked up an extra 1st which was later Shamet.  Who also was pissed away by Brand in Tobi deal.   And also selected Jerami grant who in Bryan Colangelo first move was traded for ersan.     Year 3   Okafor - was traded to Boston for the Jaylen brown pick.  Newly installed Advisor Jerry Colangelo cancelled.   Bunch of 2s- one of which was Richaun Holmes who was later given away in a cash dump so we could compete a trade for Mike Muscala  It wasn‚Äôt perfect.    But a lot of the mistakes were bc of subsequent GMs.    Put another way, Embiid, Dario, Grant and Holmes isn‚Äôt a bad haul for 3 drafts.  Plus UD free agents RoCo and TJ.    If he was allowed to complete the Jaylen trade bad if brown didn‚Äôt fuck up Bridges it would be even better.  But those are out of his control."
"Let's take this to another level. Look at the lottery picks for the sixers since the 2013, the beginning of the process: Nerlens Noel, MCW, Joel Embiid, Dario Saric, Jalil Okafor, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz and Zhaire Smith. Besides Embiid and Simmons, noting but backups and out-of-the-league guys."
There was one clip where he flexed after Nerlens Noel bumped him post elimination game‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll admit that was pretty funny now.
"Nerlens Noel has held it down as an elite rim protector off the pine for years now. The thunder were a great defense in large part because of his presence. Why he's not valued around the league is a mystery to me.     I'm just saying Thibs isn't a new entity, we haven't seen guys make a jump like Randle did this year so credit got to go to the player first. Thibs definitely got the whole squad playing harder and trying to win but Minnesota never broke into the top 20 in defense with him so I would say I am a half skeptic."
"Crazy to think that in that span 76ers hit big on Embiied and missed with Michael Carter/Nerlens Noel in the 2013 draft (could have had CJ Mccolllum, Giannis, Gobert), Elfrid Payton in the 2014 Draft (could have had Lavine or TJ Warren), Jhalil Okafor in the 2015 Draft (could have had Kristaps or Booker), Simmons in 2016 Draft (this may not be fair yet but could have had Jaylen Brown or Jamal Murray) and finally Fultz in the 2017 Draft (could have had Tatum or Fox).     Really is not fair to do that, because hindisght is 20:20 and at the time a lot of those picks lined up with conesensus expectations.  I also like to exclude Giannis because over half the nba passed on him but it's crazy to think Philly could trot out a starting 5 of:   PG: McCollum/Murray  SG:Booker  SF:Tatum  PF: Warren  C: Embiid"
"We‚Äôve seen some big market franchises suck pretty bad. The Lakers from ‚Äò14 to signing LeBron were bad (the worst that particular franchise has ever been), the Raptors were perpetually bad until Ujiri got there, the Rockets have stunk it up this year, the Knicks went and sucked for 2 separate 8 season stretches with like a 3 year break in the middle for Carmelo Anthony. But they at least made coherent roster moves and you can see the logic in how their rosters were *supposed* to work. They just didn‚Äôt.  No GM made a slate of selections over a 3 year period that were as incoherent as Hinkie‚Äôs and still kept their job. There was never a world where Nerlens Noel, Joel Embiid, and Jahlil Okafor all were supposed to coexist together on a winning roster. Hinkie was terrific at gathering draft capital, horrible at spending it at the actual draft."
"Mitch Robinson, who was our starting center and anchored our defense, missed almost the entire year. Since when has fucking Nerlens Noel guaranteed a top 10 defense? Dude could barely find a contract before Thibs made him look great in our system. Also for as much as Randle has improved as a player himself, his ability to pass and make smart plays out of double teams to truly be the #1 this year needs to be credited to coaching too  Thibs took a roster whose best defenders were like Nerlens Noel and Reggie Bullock maybe and made them a top 3 defense"
As a college bball fan it‚Äôs funny to see a guy like Nerlens Noel get drafted so high. Yeah he‚Äôs tall and athletic but I would never draft a guy in the top 5 who didn‚Äôt dominate college bball.
"The Process needs to get more flak for the misses they had over the years.  Sure Simmons and Embiid are nice, but they swung and missed on a *lot* of lottery picks and/or solid veterans that are not on the team anymore.  Markelle Fultz (#1), Ben Simmons (#1), Evan Turner (#2), Jahlil Okafor (#3), Joel Embiid (#3), Elfrid Payton (#10), Michale Carter Williams (#11), Nikola Vucevic (#16), Thad Young (#12), ~~Jrue Holiday (#17)~~ Nerlens Noel (#6)"
"How is it an awful take?  Sam Stinkie either drafted or traded for on draft night Nerlens Noel, Joel Embiid, and Jahil Okafor.  That‚Äôs THREE centers and no small forwards/shooting guards/point guards, and only one of them has turned into a star player.  Also, Stinkie stockpiled tons of second round picks, who in some cases become productive players.  Where are Stinkie‚Äôs really good non-lottery choices with all those extra picks?  MAYBE Sam Hinkie could have built a legitimate championship-caliber team if he had been able to see ‚ÄúThe Process‚Äù through, but based on what he actually did I don‚Äôt think that would have happened.  One only needs to look at most of the Los Angeles Clippers‚Äô history to see frequent high draft picks are not a guarantee of success."
"I‚Äôm just so happy the process has failed. Sam hinkie being hailed a genius for quite literally losing and putting out garbage rosters. Philly fans abandoning the team for years while they pumped out 10-15 wins a season.The most comical part is that even with all of the losing and lottery picks ‚Ä¶ they have exactly one elite player to show for it.  Okafor was a total bust, trading a first and Jrue for Nerlens Noel who only really found small success after Philly, fultz busting even harder than Okafor (and trading a big draft pick to get him nonetheless) and now Ben Simmons. From his first playoff series lost to the baby Celtics without kyrie i felt he was never going to be anything. A great defensive player and passer, but watching him drop 1 point in a crucial game 4 loss to the Celtics while the even younger and more inexperienced Tatum went toe to toe with lebron the next series showed me exactly how small he was. Continually praised by sixers fans and delusionally being called a top 3 young player every year while he continues to have zero shot/offense and players like  brown, Ingram, Tatum, Mitchell, trae, etc. all continually add to their arsenals every year.    Just getting a lot of pleasure watching a team who tried to game the system and purposefully lose for years have most of their players in return for it suck ass and continually under achieve in the playoffs. So happy for the hawks and young teams who build things the right way have success."
"Absolutely not. The Process was one of the most pathetic things a front office has ever done. They spent 4 years publicly declaring their intention to lose games to collect good draft picks, but all they did was instill a losing culture on their young players causing them to whither. Guys like MCW, Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel actually started off looking like good players before they realized their team had no intention of developing them.  The Raptors tried to tank for Wiggins in 2014 by trading away Rudy Gay. But the players we got for him started us on a winning streak and Masai just went with it and kept building on it instead of trying to shoot for a jackpot player in the draft."
Or nerlens Noel. Damn I think I repressed my memories of a couple of these guys lol
"""the same roster"" come on champ - the players improved, I don't know if you can put that all on Thibs. RJ Barrett was always going to develop and julius went to a new level.    Not to mention going from Bobby Portis to Nerlens Noel as back up big is essentially guaranteeing you a top 10 defense. Thibs is quality coach but don't forget he couldn't do much with a talented unit in Minnesota. 1 year sample size is a bit too small imo."
"Yeah, the best defensive player in the NBA this year was Nerlens Noel, and it wasn't even close."
"Man, I was here when y'all were saying Nerlens Noel was worth Jaylen Brown and two first round picks.  I don't want to hear any of that shit from you guys."
"Hinkie drafted Michael Carter-Williams, Nerlens Noel, and Jahlil Okafor.  Let's not pretend he knew how to spot talent and would have done any better if hadn't been pushed out.  His only good pick was Embiid and what a great pick it was.  But that's literally the only good pick he made."
Nah that belongs to our guy Nerlens Noel
"Homer time:  Randle for MIP, All NBA 2nd team, MVP votes at 5th  Thibs for COTY  Nerlens Noel for All Defensive 2nd Team  Quickley for All Rookie First Team"
"Nerlens ""the Nuclear Deterrent"" Noel."
"I need a team of only Nerlens Noel clones that are built around blocking every single opposing shot and winning games 4-0, 5-0, 6-0 on 2/52 shooting."
Nerlens Noel catches one of these every game lol.... he has to be on a all defensive team this year
"Julius Randle is a plus defender but he isn't being talked about for DPOY because he isn't an elite defender. That being said, without Randle, the Knicks would probably be an average defensive team, even with Thibs' coaching. The next man up at the 4 is Obi Toppin, who is... not good defensively  The Knicks best defender this season has been rim protectir Nerlens Noel. He should make an All Defensive team for how terrific he's been"
"No particular order but Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Alec Burks, Immanuel Quickley, Reggie Bullock, Derrick Rose, Nerlens Noel, Taj Gibson, and healthy Mitchell Robsinon."
MVP: Julius Randle   DPOY: Nerlens Noel  MIP: Julius Randle  COTY: Thibs   ROY: Quickley  6MOY: Derrick Rose
Somewhere nerlens noel just felt a shiver down his spine
"The better question is, would you rather have Drummond or Nerlens Noel?"
TL:DW they succinctly agreed it should be Nerlens Noel
I am a man of defensive finesse.  I like Nerlens Noel defense.
"Have you seen the Knicks rotation? Reggie Bullock, Nerlens Noel, Elfrid Payton, RJ Barrett, Derrick Rose, Obi Toppin is not better than Draymond, Wiggins, Oubre, Looney, Poole, Bazemore"
"Nerlens Noel would like a word with you. Lol no but in all seriousness, I think Capela is simply.. rated."
"Nerlens was a fantastic defender when on Philly. He kinda fell apart for 3-4 years and now he's back. I'm happy about this development, as I always liked Noel."
"I don't know what the hell was going on last night. Taj Gibson, Nerlens Noel, Trae Young, Clint Capella.... everyone got hurt.  Hope Trae's okay. Had he played the whole night there's a very good chance this game has a different result. I thought we were going to have to bust out Frank Ntilikina to at least try and defend him."

Nerlens Noel
Wiggins has crazy underrated athleticism. He stopped driving hard after the nerlens Noel incident.  If Wiggins could utilize his full arsenal of talents he‚Äôd be a top ten player in the league. He becomes way too complacent with his mid ranger and jumpers in general even when they‚Äôre not falling
"Probably Nerlens Noel, Reggie Bullock, and Derrick Rose. KEEP THIS SQUAD"
More like Olynk or Nerlens Noel.
hes both smart and long so has a penchant for blocks but everything else is mostly average due to a lower foot speed and lower weight kinda like nerlens noel
"Are we comparing Nikola Vucevic vs Bam Adebayo? Or are we comparing Kelly Olynyk vs Nerlens Noel?  I think in most cases, you take the defensively versatile big because that's easier to build around. But in some cases (teams like the Bucks or Lakers), the stretch big might be the better option."
He was awesome! Love the guys that don‚Äôt put up many stats but their impact is felt throughout the game. Shoutout to Nerlens Noel!
The tin man is basically just Nerlens Noel
Nerlens No-No-Noel
They don't cost much tbh. Nerlens Noel for example is cheap af.
"Nerlens ""No L's"" Noel"
"Nerlens Noel: ""No, no, no."""
Nerlens ‚ÄúJarrett ‚ÄòMarcus Smart‚Äô Allen‚Äù Noel
"‚ÄúMr. Noel, what‚Äôs your first name and what team are you playing?‚Äù  Noel: ‚ÄúNerlens.‚Äù"
nerlens noel runs like a jaguar stalking its prey
"Nerlens Noel.   Provides game changing elite defense on 5 million a yr.   Whether it's blocks, steals, deflections, DBPM, TS%, charges drawn, screen assists, switching onto perimeter players he's statistically elite at all them while starting on a playoff team with the actual starter missing for half the season."
Reggie Bullock and Nerlens Noel have been very solid for us and they are on cheap deals
"Nah, I love the shit ones just as much where teams are trying to score off Nerlens Noel jumpshots and Cody Zeller postups."
PG - Russell Westbrook SG - Rodney Hood SF - Cam Reddish PF - Carmelo Anthony C - James Wiseman Bench - Hassan Whiteside Bench - Marcus Morris Bench - Derrick Jones Bench - Nerlens Noel Bench - Torrey Craig Bench - Eric Bledsoe Bench - Kelly Oubre  This team is a a disaster defensively and the stagnation offensively would be atrocious.
Both Nerlens Noel and Taj Gibson have over-achieved in this system. Both have come up big when they're needed. I just hope they can stay healthy...
"I mean it‚Äôs good to have hope. Look at KD this year, looks just as explosive as ever and has no fear driving off of his Achilles. It‚Äôs not an ERA long gone if Steph is having his second best year of his career. Look at players now who have had ACL years as well. Lavine is having the best year of his career. Nerlens Noel is an elite defender. Lou Williams didn‚Äôt lose a step. There are a lot of players who are still great after an ACL tear. Sure, he could be significantly hampered. But there is also a decent enough chance to continue to be great that I‚Äôll keep my hopes up."

Nerlens ‚Äúlets be friends‚Äù Noel
"This Roster is good enough to compete in the West. We had a WORST roster and was gunning for 8th seed. Luke doesn't know how to attack any weaknesses against the other squads and doesn't rotate things well. He is genuinely so bad as a coach he is detrimental to the whole team.   Look at the knicks, they added nerlens noel and Alec Burks and are now a top tier defensive team because of Thibs."

Nerlens Noel has the skinniest legs I have ever seen
Boogie and Nerlens Noel are always going to be the examples of what can go wrong if you bet on yourself instead of taking the money that you're being offered
"Pg Facundo Compazzo SG Andre Roberson Sf Gary Pf Draymond Green C Nerlens Noel  This was harder than I thought.  He gets the shots, they scored 52 points a game and he doesn't quite get to 30 a game üòÇ"
"Nerlens Noel is seriously underrated man. Dominant defensive player. After fumbling the bag, he may finally get it this summer."
"Randles evolution is huge definitely factor number one for me, but Nerlens Noel is also a huge factor, without Mitch you guys still have an elite rim protector as a bare minimum. Thibs couldn't crack the top 20 in DRTG in 2.5 years with KAT, having solid players makes a big difference in implementing schemes.     I love Kanter but Noel would have allowed our guys to be far more aggressive on the perimeter without Nurk."
&gt; After turning Nerlens Noel into one of the top defensive centers in the league   Nerlens has always been among the best defensive centers in the league.  He's over of the few bigs that can defend the perimeter.
Bradley Beal is who I thought Ben McLemore would be. I had higher expectations for Nerlens Noel too and Justise Winslow
"Is Nerlens Noel the player with the biggest disparity on offence and defence, possibly ever?  On D he legit looks like a top 3 defensive center, but on offense every time he drops the easiest pass inside i wanna put a hole in the wall"
Nerlens Noel. His rim protection is a big reason why the Knicks are near the top of the league in defensive efficiency.
Nerlens Noel brought this guy right back down to Earth.
Nerlens Noel where he bet 65 million dollars for like 10 extra wasn't it.
Bron said fuck this shit if I gotta go through Kawhi KD AND Nerlens Noel I‚Äôm retiring
Lol you are talking about nerlens noel
"I wish this happened to a more relevant or higher caliber player making the story and lawsuit even juicier. When you look at a player named Nerlens Noel, you can't help but say ""Who?"""
That just seemed like Rich Paul posturing and giving a big old ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the 76ers cause of the Nerlens Noel lawsuit.
"Yeah I‚Äôm skeptical about a lot of the conspiracies related to him. Like a lot of these reports could be true, but you have to consider what incentive the reporter might have to report it, the incentives that the source has to give them that information, etc. I mean, a lot of the Nerlens Noel thing hinges on whether Brett Brown was telling him the truth. Maybe he lied, maybe it‚Äôs true, maybe he misremembered, who knows. It‚Äôs just kinda hard for me to understand why everyone takes every tweet they see at face value."
Does everything have to be a conspiracy theory after this whole Nerlens Noel mess? Maybe the dude just wants out?
Maybe you should consider reading about how he fucked Nerlens Noel out of ~$80m and regularly neglects his smaller clients (which he allegedly poaches from other agents).
"Then we will see news about Maxey leaving Klutch and finding new representation very soon. He‚Äôs a grown man, his agent isn‚Äôt going to determine where he plays.   Rich Paul has an extensive client list outside of Nerlens Noel full of guys that are happy with his representation and it only keeps growing. I‚Äôll bet that the agent is acting on behalf of his client before assuming he‚Äôs controlling a players career against his wishes"
[Rich Paul told Nerlens he could get his  The bag. Then Nerlens hurt his thumb and Rich Paul refused to answer the phone when teams were trying to reach him to sign Noel. Nerlens had no idea and found out after the fact](http://sportsagentblog.com/2021/08/24/nerlens-noel-blasts-nba-agent-rich-paul-in-new-lawsuit/)
I don't think Nerlens Noel feels particularly empowered right now.
It's about the Nerlens Noel thing and the Sixers confirming that what Brett BRown claimed (That Paul never replied to contract offers).
"How far does the ""1st Team All-They Fucked Up"" team go?  PG - Schroeder  SG - Oladipo  SF - Spreewell (?)  PF - Joe Smith  C - Nerlens Noel"
"Did Schroders agent do what was best for Dennis?   Did Oladipos agent do what was best for him?   Shit happens‚Ä¶ Nerlens Noel is a grown man. If he didn‚Äôt think he could get a better contract, he should have taken the deal on the table. Why did Zach Lavine just hire Rich Paul if he‚Äôs so terrible?"
Except for when this exact agent didn't work for Nerlens Noel
Could‚Äôve sworn he worked for Nerlens Noel too
"The story is very new, and yes I don't know what Maxey feels. But he has set up and done multiple community events, and is primed for a starting pg position. Even without knowing what he wants (which none of us do), it is MUCH more likely that he would rather stay than not. It doesn't help that Rich Paul is already being sued for going AGAINST his clients needs and wishes(Nerlens Noel)."
"I think a lot of outside fans were skeptical of your roster construction even before that. Drafting Embiid, Okafor, Nerlens Noel, and Simmons was really questionable. Colangelo is such a dipshit. I didn't see how having 4 giant non-shooters would work. Embiid surprised everyone when he became a 3 point shooter, but the other three worked out as expected.   The Markelle Fultz thing really fucked you because he was actually supposed to be a decent shooter. So did the Zhaire Smith sesame oil thing. So not all preventable."
"I just want to say that, despite what this sub seems to think, agents are not evil forces manipulating poor and innocent players.  Nerlens Noel is suing Rich Paul because he allegedly didn't do his job, not because Rich Paul jedi mind tricked him into not accepting the Mavs deal."
"It doesn't have anything to do with the discussion, I was making a cheeky remark to be an asshole.  As for Rich Paul, even if it is just allegations as of now, the Nerlens Noel situation and now Rich Paul trying to get Maxey out of Philly are in my opinion an abuse of power as an agent that will have an impact on the product of NBA basketball, which is why so many people are unhappy and hate Rich Paul.  And I don't believe any other agents operate in such a way that they have as much influence on player's actions as Rich Paul has. If there are, I'd love to be proven wrong."
I mean apparently Rich Paul has no problem doing stuff for his clients without their consent if we look at Nerlens Noel so what's your point?
The Sixers are going to need to include assets such as Maxey anyway to move Simmons lousy contract.  I think it's more Rich Paul throwing a hissy-fit because of the Nerlens Noel thing and wanting to get away from the Sixers.  But Paul has little say or leverage in this matter.
"Rich Paul has built up a level of influence and power because of his relationship with LeBron, and he's used it convince tons of young players to sign on as clients. ""If LeBron vouches for him, he's gotta be legit."" Then these players follow his advice, not understanding that they're not LeBron and Paul isn't treating them the same. These young guys just want to ball and trust their agent to handle contracts and the rest. It's very easy to abuse that trust, and it seems like that's what Rich Paul is doing here. Hopefully the Nerlens Noel lawsuit will open some eyes about how Rich Paul operates with his clients who aren't superstars and leads to a bit of a reality check. We'll see."
"Umm, lot's of people here complaining about Rich Paul.  But ultimately Philly doesn't have to do jack shit in regard to what Rich Paul wants with Maxey.  And Maxey is an adult who could tell Paul to fuck right off if he wants to go to a charity event.  Rich Paul might be acting like a spoiled brat, perhaps because of the Nerlens Noel situation.  But Paul has little leverage.  I think in order for Philly to be able to move Simmons, they are going to have to include assets such as Maxey because Simmons is overpaid and a net negative player in relation to his contract value.  No team is going to want Simmons by himself."
"This is a shitshow. Let's be real Maxey is a 20 years kid, he doesn't know the ins and outs of the league's management. His agent is suposed to put his best interest first, not use him as a chess piece for another guy's trade. The fiduciary duty of agents is important, specially when their clients are still very young and in many cases very new to profesional sports and the job market in general. Between this and the Nerlens Noel ignoring calls thing, it's a terrible look for Klutch Sports and the league in general."
"That's why I said it sounds like Rich Paul is trying to poison Maxey against the Sixers. It would be unheard of for a 20-year-old drafted in the 20s and entering his second season, on the verge of an increased role on an Eastern Conference contender, to demand a trade. But Rich Paul has a history of not prioritizing the interests of his non-headlining clients and trying to control where they go. It's part of the reason he's being sued by Nerlens Noel."
Rich Paul is human scum. Hopefully Nerlens Noel sues him into abject poverty.
I mean it‚Äôs pretty clear he was referring to the ongoing Nerlens Noel story where multiple teams have said Rich Paul wouldn‚Äôt take their calls for his client
Nerlens Noel would disagree
He's probably referring to the Nerlens Noel case recently
Nerlens Noel filing was public info. You can't file a private lawsuit dude.
Is Rich Paul going scorched earth with trade demands for Simmons and Maxey because Sixers personnel leaked information to Nerlens Noel that went into his lawsuit against Paul?
Also if they fine him it‚Äôll piss off Rich Paul &amp; make it less likely for his clients to sign with the Sixers‚Ä¶ seeing as he likes to ignore teams if he feels like it (i.e. Nerlens Noel).
"The process was Jahlil Okafor, Nerlens Noel, Markelle Fultz. Confirmed failure."
"i know it wont change a thing really but shouldn't Nerlens Noel be on the Boston Team, he went to highschool in Everett for at least a little bit"
"Him, Sidney Crosby, Andrew Luck, and Bryce Harper were all hailed as the wonder kids future GOATs. And he's the only one to stay healthy and maximize his potential.   Sidney Crosby also did a fantastic job living up to his hype as the next one but obviously the concussions sucked. Bryce is fine. But he didn't meet his expectations to the likes of LeBron and Sidney Crosby.   But like I think Lebron's the first athlete who kinda controlled his career and his legacy. Shouts out to the Big O for introducing free agency. Like often we are left wondering what a players career could have been had he been surrounded by talent. How good could Andrew Luck have been had he had better O-line protection. How good could Aaron Rodgers have been had the Packers drafted WRs in the first round instead say a QB. How good could John Elway have been had he had a run game all his career.   LeBron was like ""oh you are not going to get good players in the primes and just get big names past their prime.....alright bet"" and then went out and pulled in Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Then came back and forced the Cavs to correctly trade for Kevin Love even with Andrew Wiggins going to Minnesota.   Lakers and Heat are the only teams who actually set up LeBron to succeed. Cavs didn't do it till LeBron forced them to.   And then dude had a inner circle coming into the league who he lifted to great lengths.   Granted Klutch Sports Group fucked over a bunch of players and I hope Nerlens Noel gets at least $40-50 mil in compensation."
Grant was super into the idea of playing for a black coach and being a voice in a black community - intangibles that Denver can't offer  Also as much as I loved the idea of Grant in Detroit I get the idea of wanting to bet on yourself so you can prove you're worth a bigger bag. It's not like a Nerlens Noel type of deal where he walked away from a stupidly big bag either.
"&gt;Teams are too weak, they aren't actually in a bad spot until 8 years in. What star player has pulled a Nerlens Noel and taken the QO?  Not too many big names. The biggest names I can see are Greg Monroe (who was considered a decent prospect at one time), Ben Gordon, and then guys like Nick Young, Stromile Swift, Spencer Hawes, Rasto Nesterovic, Marco Belinelli, and Michael Olowokandi. Olowokandi was a pretty big bust, but I can still see why he took the offer to get off the Clippers."
"**Trade 1:** Warriors get big 3 with Beal  **Details:** Beal and Thomas Bryant to Warriors for Wiggins, one of Kuminga or Moody, Wiseman, and 2/3 FRPs  **Explanation:** Warriors need some more spark given how limited Draymond is offensively now. Beal hopefully finally wants out. Wizards get a young piece in Kuminga/Moody and Wiseman along with 2/3 FRPs and a great starter in Wiggins.   &amp;#x200B;  **Trade 2:** Dame finally asks out  **Details:** Dame and A. Simmons to Celtics for JB, Rob Williams, Josh Richardson, Aaron Nesmith and 2/3 FRPs  **Explanation:** Dame and JT make the Celtics an actual threat for the next 2-3 years while Dame is still good. No way Portland says yes without getting at least JB in return, good starter in Rob Williams, and a good young piece in Nesmith. J. Rich mostly in there for salary matching. And of course, picks.  &amp;#x200B;  **Trade 3:** Luka hopefully gets a more reliable scoring option next to him and some defense  **Details:** KP for Evan Fournier, Nerlens Noel, and Kevin Knox   **Explanation:** KP has been trash for the Mavs and needs a change in scenery. Luka gets a 18 ppg consistent shooter in Fournier, a great defensive big and lob threat in Noel, and Kevin Knox as a ball boy at practice."
"&gt;The difference here (and player agents as a whole) is RP manages different players with different interests across different teams. RP is prominent because of Lebron.  I'm not sure how that makes Rich Paul different than any other agent. How many people without looking it up can tell you who Steph Curry's agent is? Why does everyone care so much about LeBron's agent?   &gt;I care because I love the league/basketball. Even if its Joe McNobody, as I said in the previous comments, IF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE PROVEN TO BE TRUE, it has pretty shitty implications with the agents.  I don't see how it has ""shitty implications with the agents"". I'm not even sure what that means, to be honest.    &gt;My main point is x agent (COULD LITERALLY BE ANYBODY) is not acting on the best interest of his client.   *If* that is true, then it's not the first time something like that has happened in sports or entertainment, nor will it be the last. It won't even be close to the worst stuff agents have done to their clients. Go look at what happened with Tim Duncan or Kareem or Britney Spears and you'll see this pales in comparison. People only know or care about this specific incident because they already know who Rich Paul is and because a lot of people want to see him taken down.   &gt;Once investigations start, who knows what the hell they find.   I think you should prepare yourself for something here: there almost surely will not be any kind of ""investigation"". There will probably be some out of court settlement between the parties with non disclosure agreements signed on both sides and we'll never know any of the specifics. That's part of why I am not too worked up about any of this.   &gt;Like jesus man, take a second to critically think what it boils down to (agent not acting in the best interest of a player) and realise that has league wide implications.  None of this has ""league wide implications"". Nobody is going to strip Rich Paul of his ability to be an agent, none of that. Maybe it ends up hurting Rich Paul's business because word among players spreads that he's not good at his job, but judging by this Zach LaVine news that doesn't seem to be happening. But if it did, so what? There's a line of agents waiting to take his place if he finds that nobody wants to hire him.   This is why, again, I don't care about what happens with Rich Paul and Nerlens Noel. It'll resolve itself one way or another and the league will roll on either way. This is just like if the league's most prominent accountant suddenly couldn't find business anymore, I wouldn't care about that either."
"There are people with a motive to take down Rich Paul who are making these allegations. I don't know them anymore than I know him. In any event, like I said, why should I care? If I was looking to hire a sports agent then maybe I'd care about various allegations against Rich Paul, but I'm not, so what business is it of mine?   Someone like him no doubt works based on his reputation, so if the people looking to hire him think he's bad at his job then they'll probably stop hiring him. If they think he's good they'll keep hiring him. Whatever this situation with Noel is, it'll resolve itself one way or another and life will go on.   It's like when Tim Duncan accused one of his financial advisors of bilking him out of a bunch of money. My reaction was ""that sucks if it's true"" and that was pretty much all the thought I gave it. It wasn't my business and neither is this.   People around here don't really care about Nerlens Noel, they just hate Rich Paul for some reason and want bad things to happen to him. It still strikes me as weird that people have such strong feelings about a sports agent, especially when I doubt that the average fan could name more than maybe one or two other agents, nor could any of us tell you who represents even the most well known players. Why everyone cares so much about Rich Paul should be the real issue here, IMO."
"You‚Äôre not smart and that‚Äôs okay. Marcus Morris already publicly stated that Rich told him to take the 3 year $41 million contract from the Clippers because the Spurs could only offer him the MLE. This is known in the NBA that Rich Paul hates Leon Rose &amp; Leon Rose hates Rich Paul, Rich TRIES to keep his clients away from the Knicks &amp; Leon Rose TRIES to keep Klutch clients off the Knicks (made Mitchell Robinson &amp; Nerlens Noel leave Klutch &amp; released Alonzo Trier because he wouldn‚Äôt leave Klutch). Morris agreed to the San Antonio deal, backed out of it so Rich had to relieve himself of Morris‚Äôs representation so his relationship with the Spurs would stay strong because he has 3 clients on the Spurs still."
"again you are totally missing the point.   I am totally on the fuck rich paul bandwagon, but from the player's POV I get it.  I feel like people think Paul just doesn't have negotiation skills and and couldn't figure out how to get Nerlens offers that summer. When in reality, the dude was simply way too busy to go searching out for contracts for his more mid/lower level clients. Of course that makes him a dick and a shitty agent for most players, but a All-star/Olympian in his prime like Lavine knows he'll get taken care of  This Nerlens Noel summer is the same year of Bron's LA move. Same time as positioning of AD It was obvious to anyone prior to this story that Paul is most concerned with his top clients, so naturally a guy like Nerlens gets lost in the puddle during the quick FA period.   Lavine is likely the top client of Paul this summer. He's going to be a priority."
"Rich Paul is a powerful agent, he got into the business by being LeBrons friend and agent. He also gets  some hate because people think, being LeBrons friend and agent, he's just an extension of LeBrons will and influence in the league.   He's very a very polarizing figure because he does seemingly sleazy things for his clients like the whole AD to the Lakers situation was him.  He also seems to have a bet on yourself attitude that attracts players but has famously backfired with players like Nerlens Noel. These attitudes have caused many players to come to his company but also caused some teams and other agents to hate him(though the agent hatred seems more like cutthroat business hatred rather than any real line crossing).   BUT recently Noel has accused Paul of not acting in his interests and not fielding calls about him from other teams, leading him to getting a very small contract. This is a very serious accusation because its basically him not doing his job after convincing Noel to sign with him. Not an unheard of accusation, but a much more public one than normal and with a more famous agent.   We don't know how true the accusations are but some teams(rockets and 6ers) have said they couldn't get in touch with Paul about Noel. So thats not good.   But at the same time we don't know if that was because there was another deal he was possibly working(rumors back then were the Thunder) that fell through or if he truly was just ignoring his client. Was it all a bad gamble or was Paul truly that uncaring?  Either way the last few days the sub has been in the rage cycle about Paul with people running with the Noel case as 100% true and talking about how Paul should be banned and how no one will ever trust him and how he was crippling other teams for LeBron. The usual karma dramatic opinion competition.   But now another big name has signed with Paul and his company and so some of doomsaying doesn't seem to be coming immediately so others are laughing at it."
i challenge perk to say nerlens noel 5 times fast
"&gt; If that's actually what he did then sure. But none of us knows the truth there, there's just allegations. I didn't witness any of it so I have no clue how true any of it is. I'm guessing if it was that cut and dry then he wouldn't be apparently on the verge of signing another high profile player, but maybe I'm wrong. If he fucked up, he should pay him.  They are pretty bad allegations tho with 2 teams coming out saying the same thing. All other reasons aside about people not liking Rich Paul, he has a HUGE influence due to the number and status of the type of players he represent. If it comes out as true, it has pretty major consequences as to how players are represented.  Regarding the second half of your text, TL:DR is just ""People are using the Nerlens Noel situation to justify their hate"" and that's all you have to say. AS to that, fair enough to mad about that but jesus man, the way you ""totally not defending but am defending RP"" is almost stan levels.  &gt; For me finding out that some player's agent may have made mistake while representing him has the same impact as if I'd found out that Noel's accountant had misfiled his taxes.   For you maybe, but for me, despite not have an interest, still see the implications if RP is found to not acting in the best interest of clients. You seem to keep forgetting that this is a legitimate reason to not be a fan of RP.  Regarding the last paragraph, Zach is a big enough star in the league that he wont be as affecte as the guys making anything but the max/supermax. Guys whose worth is actually based on negotiation, leverage. Again, going back to Noel, that's gonna be shit when you're barely making money and you see your agent not taking calls for another player."
"Nerlens Noel is suing him and accusing him of some shady shit.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32079344/new-york-knicks-nerlens-noel-sues-rich-paul-klutch-claiming-loss-58m-potential-salary  People don't like him and are speaking out about him, for example the Sixers just said they called Paul several times about Noel's availability before he signed with the Knicks and never got a return call.  https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2021/08/24/nba-agent-rich-paul-refused-to-negotiate-nerlens-noel-return-to-sixers/"
"Harvard is just a generic example, but there's a lot of evidence that getting into a decent school in general is much more likely if you come from even a middle class family. You don't have to have your parents buy your way in, but having parents that can afford to have you take SAT prep courses will make your scores go way up, just like being able to afford private schools will help with your education. Honestly it's naive to feel like Rich Paul is the only guy who got to his position through something other than exclusively hard work. You're kidding yourself if you think most agents started from the same place that he did.   You're also kidding yourself if you think he's the only guy LeBron ever encountered. LeBron chose him to represent him for more than just random happenstance. He must have done something to impress him, probably many things. Additionally, he wouldn't have done as well with the opportunity LeBron gave him if he wasn't actually good at his job. Nerlens Noel might not think so, but I'll bet someone like John Wall does."
"I‚Äôm not really interested in partaking in oppression Olympics, or telling a black man how to feel, but it‚Äôs not like these other agents represent only white players, while rich Paul represents black players‚Ä¶ He literally fucked over Nerlens Noel From tens of millions of dollars if the stories are true, and I think that‚Äôs enough justification to hate him. Not to mention he‚Äôs heavily associated with LeBron James which carries its own weight"
The real problem with Rich Paul is probably here.  He doesn't give enough attention to clients like Nerlens Noel who sign contracts for less money than the big stars he represents.  Nerlens Noel may feel shortchanged in this regard.
"The agent has a duty to advise, of course. However, I don't think you can blame the agent for giving advice to his client on the fact that he can get a bigger contract the following year.  It is then up to the player to make the choice. Nerlens Noel could go against Rich Paul's advice and sign if he felt it wouldn't work out the way he advised.  It's the same problem for Schroder who turned down an 80M contract from the Lakers hoping for better. His agent probably gave him bad advice or it was simply Schroder who made his choice that way.  In the end, I doubt there is a written document in which the agent committed to finding him a contract of X millions of dollars the year after.  Under these circumstances, Rich Paul will not be convicted.  Regarding the fact that Rich Paul did not do his job well as an agent by not devoting enough time to Nerlens Noel, this is understandable and it may be something for which he will be convicted."
Nerlens Noel is a pleb
I know Rich Paul's name because of:  1. Lebron James 2. Nerlens Noel 3. Others.
"&gt;But you gotta admit, failing to act in the best interest of your players is a very shitty thing to do.  If that's actually what he did then sure. But none of us knows the truth there, there's just allegations. I didn't witness any of it so I have no clue how true any of it is. I'm guessing if it was that cut and dry then he wouldn't be apparently on the verge of signing another high profile player, but maybe I'm wrong. If he fucked up, he should pay him.   &gt;But we both know you are somehow working a deeper reason (I'll bet $5 I know what it is) despite the legit criticism he gets.  I know you think it's just cause I'm a Laker fan, but I promise you that's not it, or not in the way that you think it is, anyway. Honestly I just think all the criticism around here in recent days is insincere. I don't think people here hate Rich Paul cause of doing a poor job of representing Nerlens Noel, I think they hated him before this all came out. I think most people here are happy this happened because they want to see RP taken down, and that happiness has absolutely nothing to do with Noel. I don't think people here give a shit about Nerlens Noel, they just want reasons to hate Rich Paul.   I think a lot of people have hated him for a bunch of reasons which aren't the kinds of things that would upset me. Some people hate him because of his connection to LeBron and see hating him as an extension of hating LeBron. Some people hate him because they see him as helping the Lakers, and they hate the Lakers. Some people probably hate him because of his politics (again, more of an extension for why they hate LeBron). And unfortunately some people probably hate him because they don't like that a black man without a college degree is one of the most powerful agents in sports.   None of these things are upsetting to me, so I don't have the same motivations to hate him that a lot of other people do. That's probably why it seems like I'm ""defending"" him when really I'm just not joining in in attacking him. For me finding out that some player's agent may have made mistake while representing him has the same impact as if I'd found out that Noel's accountant had misfiled his taxes. That's not my business so I don't really give a shit. And that's why my reaction to everyone going crazy over this makes me want to just say that I wish people were honest about *why* they were so ""upset"" rather than this ""poor Noel"" concern trolling that's going on.   Finally, I'll just say that in regards to this thread, if Zach LaVine is going to hire Rich Paul because he wants to end up on the Lakers, that's not Rich Paul's fault or his doing. That's cause Zach LaVine wanted to do that. People tried to act like Anthony Davis wanted to stay in New Orleans until Rich Paul and LeBron lured him away, but we're talking about grown men making their own decisions, not young children being lured into a van with candy by sinister older men. If there's a problem with player movement or player empowerment, then it's nothing that Rich Paul created, nor will it go away if he does. Blaming him for all the perceived problems with how the business of the NBA works is silly, IMO."
"Okay but we know for a fact that Noel declined a $70m/4y contract (following awful advice from his agent), and had to sign a $5m/1y contract instead.   Teams have also admitted that they tried to come out and sign Noel to bigger contracts than that $5m/1y but they couldn't contact Paul.  So how do you explain this? How is this a hit piece? Nerlens Noel wouldn't turn down $70 million just so he can talk some shit about Rich Paul. This isn't some anti-black conspiracy happening."
Nerlens fucking Noel stans who aren't really stans but really just want to hate on Lebron.
and in the thread about Nerlens noel suing it was mostly bron haters/lakers haters telling everyone Rich Paul created cancer  balances it out.
https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2020/10/17/rockets-reportedly-tried-to-trade-for-nerlens-noel-at-2020-deadline/  I guess I got the events mixed up but that‚Äôs what I remembered
"Why come so hard at Nerlens Noel? Being a hot take artist aside, he just looks a dickhead."
But but but ‚Ä¶. he killed Nerlens Noel
Rich Paul could shoot Nerlens Noel in the middle of Fifth Avenue and he wouldn't lose any clients.
"I don‚Äôt actually read too much of anything he says, I clicked on this because it was discussing Nerlens Noel who used to play for the sixers. I made the comment based on everytime I see anything that has Kendrick‚Äôs name attached it seems to be something nonsensical."
"&gt; this is like when the process 76ers traded for nerlens noel, the next year they drafted embiid and then decided to draft jahlil okafor the next season.  Not really. Because of the simply fact they gave up assets and paid Lauri $16.7M or $21M annually just to develop him. Lauri is not better than Nance Jr. And Mobley has a better ceiling than Lauri.   This deal is really a head scratcher for me."
&gt; I really didn't expect Nerlens Noel to be the story of the summer  I think I said this in 2017 after he turned down 4/$70M lol
"Yea, but they are necessary, especially for the Nerlens Noel types. I mean, if you're 23 years old and the only thing you've done is play basketball, it makes sense. You don't know how to negotiate multi million dollar contracts with executives. They'll eat you for lunch. So pay a percentage and bring in the professionals to do it for you."
I really didn't expect Nerlens Noel to be the story of the summer
"That was one of the worst drafts of the last decade, nerlens Noel was the consensus number 1 more of the season but got hurt IIRC and dropped. Anthony Bennett was expected to be a top ten pick but it was definitely a shock he went number 1.  It was a seriously bad draft"
Lol rich paul is shady but this is some delusional reaching. He ignored the phone calls to make sure nerlens fuckin noel couldn‚Äôt join the clippers and bounce Lebron? Lmao
"wait so let me get this right  they went into the offseason planning to re-sign jarret allen, okay reasonable. then they drafted evan mobley, the fits a little weird but its still reasonable. now they sign markannen for starter money, what the fuck now lmao.  this is like when the process 76ers traded for nerlens noel, the next year they drafted embiid and then decided to draft jahlil okafor the next season."
"Oh sorry, I might have spoken too fast. I'm willing to believe you when you say Rich Paul is being a victim of racist attacks but you're gonna need to substantiate your point, because black people can too be bad agents.  Please demonstrate how the grievances expressed against Rich Paul are due to his race and not to incompetency/negligence or even mere non-racial related jealousy, and then when you've established your reasoning and demonstrated that these attacks on Rich are indeed due to racism, explain how it doesn't apply to Noel Nerlens who is a black individual that was despoiled in this case."
"we talk about Nerlens Noel? Nerlens Noel? not Joel Embiid, not Bam Adebayo, Nerlens Noel."
Nerlens Noel was never that guy and he should've taken that money. He wasn't going to get that much better to be able to justify a huge increase from the 70 million he was being offered. He wasn't that guy before the 70 mil and he certainly isn't that guy now. Bet on yourself but also be realistic about what you're capable of.
I mean I think Paul did Nerlens Noel dirty...but not bc he‚Äôs black... Those racist attacks aren‚Äôt the root of conversation rn as to why Paul is being scrutinized
Nerlens Noel is infinitely more successful and accomplished than 99.9% of people will ever be lol
"&gt; At the start of free agency in 2017, Noel was represented by agent Happy Walters. Noel claims in the lawsuit he was offered a four-year, $70 million deal by the Mavericks, a number that was reported by several news outlets that summer. During the free-agency process, Noel said he fired Walters and hired Paul after they met at Ben Simmons' birthday party in Los Angeles.          ...        &gt; In the lawsuit, Noel said Paul advised him to pass on the $70 million offer and accept a one-year deal so he could be an unrestricted free agent the following year when Paul said he could get Noel a more lucrative contract.       https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32079344/new-york-knicks-nerlens-noel-sues-rich-paul-klutch-claiming-loss-58m-potential-salary"
Nerlens Noel made the mistake of turning down that offer and deserved to be clowned for it.   Rich Paul deserves to get hate for basically not being a proper agent to Nerlens Noel.
You guys realize we‚Äôre talking about Nerlens Noel right? I get how much Lebron is disliked in here and apparently Rich Paul but this is Nerlens Noel lol
"I'm not apologising for shit.  Fuck Nerlens Noel, fuck Rich Paul and fuck you."
I was referencing the wackos that equate Rich Paul being bad at his job to ‚ÄúTHIS WAS ALL A DEEPER PLOT TO KEEP SUPERSTARS LIKE NERLENS NOEL AWAY FROM BEATING LEBRON LED TEAMS AND HAVING THEM JOIN HIM ON THE VET MIN‚Äù
The most gilded comment is a conspiracy theory about Lebron controlling the league through Paul and how Paul/Lebron didn‚Äôt want Nerlens Noel to sign in Philly in 2019 because Nerlens Noel supposedly would‚Äôve made 76ers a championship contender. Yes because Noel would‚Äôve fixed Ben‚Äôs jump shot and Lebron couldn‚Äôt let that happen.
Lavine and Wiggins called themselves the Bounce Bros when they were on the Wolves. They were a great dunking duo until Wiggins stopped dunking altogether after he almost killed Nerlens Noel.
"Rich Paul was gassing Nerlens Noel that he will receive ""100 Million Dollar contact"" Each year these agency would attempt to get new clients. If the agency don't see you as profitable they will do any way directly or indirectly to get out of the agreement between both parties. I guess Nerlens Noel thought Rich Paul was going to be a mentor even if Rich Paul &amp; Klutch Sports weren't going to make significant profits off Nerlens Noel. Nerlens Noel realize it is not the case with some of certain situations he is hearing, and filing a lawsuit against Rich Paul. It seems like in Nerlens Noel perspective Rich Paul and Klutch Sports [""breach of the various fiduciary duties owed Noel""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/knicks-nerlens-noel-sues-nba-agent-rich-paul-alleging-indifference-cost-him-millions/) with some statements from team saying they contacted Rich Paul, but Rich Paul didn't answer. In the article many people say Rich Paul has history mismanaging less notable clients. That is what I mean welcome to the real world, because with the amount of money these athletes can make if you are deem not profitable to some of these agents they can do you dirty."
"Nerlens looked like a juicy client poised for a 5/80mil. Then teams lost interest, Noel was only getting slightly more than a min at best (2/12 or something), and Rich Paul slacked off since he got busy recruiting new players."
"Well I mean, Rich Paul has fucked over some players now. Nerlens Noel‚Äôs agents decisions to rejected the Mavs $70 mil offer and take the qualifying is one of the worst contract decisions in nba history.  The 76ers massively overpaid for Al Horford according to most experts and they wanted Noel first, but the agent couldn‚Äôt be bothered to answer the phone?   Nobody talks about Shabaka Muhammad, but the dude only lasted in the league for a couple years, but was advised to reject $44 million? The dude ain‚Äôt even in the league anymore. That‚Äôs downright criminal of Rich Paul to turn those down.  If you‚Äôre about player empowerment, having agents screwing over players is the opposite of what you should want."
shrug. well whats a plausible explanation for houston and pennsylvania not getting any call backs for noel nerlens?
"Honestly yes, it's the most likely scenario. Especially considering it was filed as a counter suit to the commission claim  &gt;""It is wild to see all of it aired out like this,"" another veteran agent said. ""It happens all the time, but it never becomes public. It happens around the draft even. Guys will say anything to convince these players to come.""  Maybe these headlines do go away and Noel's filing was simply a public gesture against the agent he feels wronged him. ""I'll pay you this 200 grand, but I'm gonna s--t in your cornflakes before I do,"" one representative who previously worked with Noel said.  The majority of league sources contacted by B/R do expect the union to settle some type of agreement between these two parties, being that a legitimate legal battle benefits neither Klutch nor Noel. For Noel to win $58 million in alleged lost salary, he would seemingly face a daunting uphill battle in a court of law.  ""The truth is Nerlens is not innocent in this,"" another agent said. ""If you're silly enough to turn down that kind of money, that's not on Rich.""  Paul's defense would be simple: An agent can never be held accountable for accurately predicting the future. He was providing a client with counsel, counsel that Noel did not have to accept, and if Noel did not suffer an injury, he very well could have garnered a richer deal."
"My guy, do you really not understand that regardless of what Nerlens and Paul ""agreed"" to, NERLENS IS STILL THE PLAYER.  By LAW and under his fiduciary duty as an agent, Paul HAS to inform him of the offers made.  For all you know, Nerlens hears a number and years he really likes and says fuck the QO plan, I want that contract.  Rich Paul doesn't determine what Nerlens Noel does, he advises and negotiates on his behalf.  If you're not giving the player the full scope of the offers received, he's making a poorly informed decision.  Jesus fuck this isn't that difficult"
The most realistic player from the FA class  for them to get is Seth Curry. So Seth Curry and Nerlens Noel is enough to go from getting swept by the Celtics to making some noise in the playoffs? Tell me you don‚Äôt watch basketball without telling me
Shabbazz KCP and Morris are the three that come to mind for me on top of nerlens noel
"&gt;‚ÄúHey rich Paul, it‚Äôs Elton brand here we got an offer for Nerlens at 4 years, $100m on the table but we have to move fast. Give me a call back if this is something you‚Äôre interested in‚Äù  You're making a random assumption that the GMs were leaving details of their offer on voicemail. I highly doubt anyone dealing with contracts worth tens of millions of dollars does that. At the most, they would have left a voicemail saying they have ""an"" offer for Noel, and that he should call them back so they can discuss it in detail. They're not putting their cards on the table on fucking voicemail.  Secondly, Rich Paul has a duty to present his clients with all information. Even if a team is offering a minimum deal contract, he should tell them. He can go ahead and give his opinion along with it, and tell Noel that he thinks it's a shitty deal and he shouldn't take it. But it is not his place to decide that he won't even attend calls or tell Noel about potential offers. His job is as a facilitator, *not* as the decision maker."
"The OP purposely left out large parts of the article. Other important information  &gt; That accept-the-qualifying-offer, bet-on-yourself tactic‚Äîin addition to client-poaching from other agents‚Äîhas drawn ire from Paul's rivals in the agency world. To be fair, they are often guilty of the same activities; a significant portion of income for larger agencies is generated by poaching clients before a player's next lucrative deal.  &gt;The National Basketball Players Association does not prohibit certified agents from contacting other certified agents' clients, a noted contrast to the NBA's tampering rules, prohibiting team executives from contacting rival teams' talent. That stance has frustrated many agents for years.  &gt;And it's not just Paul.  &gt;Sources told Bleacher Report that Victor Oladipo was influenced to leave longtime representative Aaron Turner of Versus Management for Excel Sports just before free agency this summer. Excel gave Oladipo the same sales pitch: a new agent can deliver more money than the previous one. In this case, like Noel's, they didn't deliver.  &gt;Back in 2017, Robert Covington left his agent Chris Patrick (who helped land the two-way forward his first legitimate NBA stop in Philadelphia) for behemoth CAA Sports ahead of signing a four-year, $62 million deal.  &gt;Oladipo and Covington are merely two of a long list of examples.  &gt;The union has never shown much interest in policing such backchanneling. But a popular solution often mentioned by agents is saving 1 percent of the commission on a player's next contract for the previous representative, which would likely require some form of arbitration.  &gt;""It is wild to see all of it aired out like this,"" another veteran agent said. ""It happens all the time, but it never becomes public. It happens around the draft even. Guys will say anything to convince these players to come.""  &gt;Maybe these headlines do go away and Noel's filing was simply a public gesture against the agent he feels wronged him. ""I'll pay you this 200 grand, but I'm gonna s--t in your cornflakes before I do,"" one representative who previously worked with Noel said.  &gt;The majority of league sources contacted by B/R do expect the union to settle some type of agreement between these two parties, being that a legitimate legal battle benefits neither Klutch nor Noel. For Noel to win $58 million in alleged lost salary, he would seemingly face a daunting uphill battle in a court of law.  &gt;""The truth is Nerlens is not innocent in this,"" another agent said. ""If you're silly enough to turn down that kind of money, that's not on Rich.""  &gt;Paul's defense would be simple: An agent can never be held accountable for accurately predicting the future. He was providing a client with counsel, counsel that Noel did not have to accept, and if Noel did not suffer an injury, he very well could have garnered a richer deal.  &gt;That following summer, in 2018, Clint Capela scored a five-year, $90 million contract from the Rockets, a solid payday for a bouncy pick-and-roll threat and rim-protector of similar ilk.  &gt;Noel's case relies on the argument that Paul did not act in Noel's best interest, that Paul had no part in pitching the center to the Thunder in 2018 or sufficiently marketing him to other teams the following seasons.  &gt;It likely would be very challenging, however, for Noel's defense to find a team figure willing to come forward and confirm that series of events as a witness at trial. It's a sensitive topic that multiple league personnel declined to comment on for this article."
that should‚Äôve been Nerlens Noel money lol
"I mean we *know* about as well as we can ‚Äî reports are that the reason Noel switched to Klutch was because Rich Paul told him he could get the max if he rejected Dallas‚Äô extension and played on the QO the next year. So as soon as he signed with Klutch, the idea was for him to accept the QO and chase the max. I obviously don‚Äôt know if Nerlens was like ‚Äúyeah but if someone offers 4yrs/$100m definitely let me know about that‚Äù and that would totally change my stance but if the agreed plan was to accept the QO, I don‚Äôt know why Rich Paul would be in trouble for not fielding offers than don‚Äôt fit that plan."
No it's Nerlens Noel vs. Rich Paul.
Wow had no idea Nerlens Noel was Leon Rose. Someone should have told him before he filed a lawsuit over his own mismanagement.
"Read the thread, it looks like a bunch of people with no inside knowledge trying to correlate Rich Paul‚Äôs bad agent practices with some QAnon conspiracy that his business is set up to make LeBron win with no further proof besides ‚Äúwell Nerlens Noel on this team woild have ruined LeBron‚Äôs chances!‚Äù"
"Why does Rich Paul even need to take the calls in the first place if his client and him have already agreed to play the next year on the QO?   Also, Rich Paul was an agent for more than just Nerlens. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs seeing a call from the Sixers/Rockets and not answering it because he thinks it could be them offering a deal for Nerlens instead of the 25 other clients he has. I‚Äôm not saying that he didn‚Äôt return calls but I don‚Äôt really see the problem of him not getting back to teams inquiring about Noel if Noel and him had already agreed on accepting the QO and chasing the bag."
"But how long would that ploy work?  Plus, sandbagging Nerlens Noel would have little to no effect on the balance of power of the NBA landscape.  I think it's just pure hubris mixed with bad management and judgment."
War‚Ä¶ has changed.  -Solid Snake/Nerlens Noel
"Firstly I feel like there will be a decision with less than a year simply because I don‚Äôt think Noel has the funds to draw this out.   Secondly civil court has less burden of proof and if he‚Äôs found in the right he‚Äôll most likely get a decent settlement in the millions (if I was Rich, I‚Äôd just drag it out of the public eye and pay a settlement, which might not be possible cuz of CBA rules, but who knows).   As for Rich Paul himself, if he‚Äôs found wrong of doing anything he‚Äôll probably face a fine unless some more shit comes out (which I doubt)   From my perspective, Rich just seems hella negligent and dumb as hell when it came to Nerlens"
"I think a lot of people are overlooking that Paul was having Noel play on the QO in hopes of securing a max contract the following year. If Nerlens was on board with that plan and these teams are calling him with offers less than the max, why would his agent bring those offers to him?"
"Fair enough, but you would be beating yourself over the head if you took Nerlens Noel 9 picks ahead of Giannis Antetokounmpo"
Nerlens Noel the most
Nerlens Noel is an older version of Nic Claxton
Joe harris sign and trade for Nerlens Noel
Unacceptable offensive shortcomings are guys like Nerlens Noel who are so useoess on offense that the other teams center doesnt need to guard them.   There are only a handful of centers who would exploit Batum the way people here and saying Gobert should.
I think he‚Äôs fake dpoy because his defensive  skill set has been proven to be pretty meaningless when it matters most repeatedly in the playoffs. It‚Äôs such a replaceable player in the modern scheme. You can pay nerlens Noel the mid level and he can still hang cause he can guard the perimeter.
THAT'S NERLENS NOEL MUSIC
They‚Äôre both suped up versions of Eldrid Payton and Nerlens Noel
I think with today's NBA you can get 80% of his defensive impact for 20% of the price.   Nerlens Noel anchored a defense that was better than the Jazz's this year and he's making $5m a year. Poeltl allowed opponents to shoot only 0.2% higher at the rim than Gobert allowed and he's making $8m.
trade Rudy for Nerlens Noel who is 10x the player anyways
"I thought Nerlens Noel would be a multi-time DPOY, and I thought this ought to have been obvious to anyone paying attention.  By the way, I thought he deserved more attention for all-defense this season, but it might be confirmation bias."
"you don't need an all star at center  If these are the only all stars Team USA can get (I doubt it), you fill out the rest of the roster to build around these guys.   The talent pool is huge for non-all stars.    You can get a guy like Nerlens Noel to be your starting centre or someone more up and coming. Just go in there, space the floor a bit, play defence, rim protect. No need to be the main guy.   bring in a couple of big body centres to literally just play defence against the centre's of the world with post game moves.   The rest of the roster can still be filled with non-all stars and still be over powered.  Imagine Fox coming off the bench for a team like this or FVV.   Or Jerami Grant in the big rotation."
"&gt; Jrue was a guy averaging 18/7 on 49% TS on a bad team. He was pretty good, but not a star. A team built around him was never winning a CHAMPIONSHIP which is the ultimate goal here.  But Nerlens Noel is? Even if he lived up the potential, he was never destined to be a franchise changing player. I don't think anyone would argue Jrue Holiday is going to be the best player on a championship team, but he is a very important piece and the point is they didn't have to trade him. They traded him because he made them too good. If a 22 year old makes you too good, you don't trade them.  &gt;And what good is a winning culture for one season if you tear it down the next?   Playoff experience. Players are playing meaningful games. It shows the team isn't just trying throwing these guys out there to lose games.  &gt;Is Shai happy that instead of fighting in the playoffs his team is pissing around in the lottery for the foreseeable future? And just traded their starting caliber center for a washed PG who probably won‚Äôt even play for them?   You're saying Kemba is washing but Horford is caliber center? Or Moses Brown? Because Moses Brown doesn't win you any games right now. Kemba makes them better now. I don't know if they hold onto him and Kemba certainly isn't the same player he was, but he makes the Thunder a better team now.   &gt;Other than 2001 the Sixers for the last 30 years either hung around the lottery or limped into the 8th seed just to get smacked by the Pistons or Lebron  But that's the problem. Lots of teams are destined for the forever the 8th seed but they get out of by getting better and making smart moves. In the past decade, Indiana, Toronto, Golden State, Utah, Denver, Miami, Milwaukee, Portland and others have had more or similar success than Philadelphia without becoming awful.   Did it work for Hinkie? Yeah, in a way it has because now they are a contending team. But if Embiid doesn't his foot and gets picked by Cleveland, where does that leave Philly? All the other teams built their teams outside the top picks. If Hinkie is this mastermind like everyone claims he is, he wouldn't have had to throw away 4 seasons to turn the team into a contender."
"Moses has a knack for shot blocking and he's quite good at free throw shooting for his size.  His touch and his game awareness/hands (needs to get better at being ready to catch passes and catching and converting) could use some work. Also, he needs to improve on defense; I would say he need to get stronger but maybe he could try to emulate Nerlens Noel a bit who is not that thick himself but a fine defender."
"Also does not fit in with the current image of the NBA C. Pretty slow, very thin/lacking strength, and not a good shooter at this time. I think Nerlens Noel is a fair projection if he pans out and is on a solid roster."
He‚Äôs a skinny backup center who can‚Äôt shoot but can get lobs and block shots and is at his best in short spurts. Basically he‚Äôs slightly taller nerlens noel. He‚Äôs not a bad player at all (especially given his team friendly contract) but he isn‚Äôt some super valuable young asset with all star potential like what some people think.
"Dsj, harrison barnes, and nerlens noel"
I think Nerlens Noel already has that title locked up.
nerlens noel. everybody loves a blocked dunk
I think the closest is Nerlens Noel turning down 70m to ultimately get 4  I think his story is the NBA player equivalent of 'Scared Straight'
"The Thunder were similarly talented to this Atlanta team if you believe CP3 is the caliber of player you say he is.   CP3, Shai, Schroder, Gallo, Steven Adams, Lu Dort, Nerlens Noel, Darius Bazley, Mike Muscala, etc.   vs  Trae, Bogi, Capela, Huerter, Collins, Gallo, Lou Williams, Tony Snell, Okongwu, etc.  Left off Hunter and Reddish since both of them missed almost the entirety of this season and are out currently."
"&gt;I mean Adams is better than any of those players?   I think that's highly debatable, but it's not even a question when you compare what those guys cost. Would you rather have a 1st round pick, George Hill and Nerlens Noel or Dwight Howard for $5 or $3 million, respectively, or would you rather just have Steven Adams on a 3 year deal for $65 million? That's a no-brainer.   &gt; What can you get for 10mil?   Did you not see the part above in the OP's post that said:   * ""The Pels will also look to see if they can trade either Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams or both. The two aging vets will tie up $35 million in cap space next season.""   Wasting that kind of money is *always* bad, which is why it's now being reported that the Pels are looking to dump him. Don't be surprised if it costs them more picks to do so.   &gt; Nobody is coming to the pels unless you overpay.   Wrong, the Pels could have easily traded for Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond, both of whom were on expiring contracts (so they wouldn't now need to be salary dumped), and both of whom were eventually bought out. The Pels probably could have got a couple second round picks or possibly even a first to take either of those guys on. That would have been far better than paying what they did for Steven Adams."
"Even if you ""overpay"" for someone like Nerlens Noel or Dwight Howard, what does that look like? $7 million per year? That's far better than giving up multiple draft picks and George Hill just to get Steven Adams for 3 years and $65 million. The Pelicans probably could have received a draft pick to take on Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond, considering both guys eventually got bought out.   The Steven Adams trade and extension were just utterly stupid all the way around. Sorry."
"And Lamar Odom, Derek Fisher, Monta Ellis, Nerlens Noel‚Ä¶"
"He gave up multiple picks and George Hill to acquire Adams on an insane $30 million contract, and then he extended him another $35 million over two extra years. Meanwhile if Griff just wanted a traditional big next to Zion he could have made Nerlens Noel, Dwight Howard, Bismark Biyombo or Mason Plumlee an offer and grabbed any one of them for a fraction of the price. Or hell, he probably could have *acquired* a pick to take someone like Gorgui Dieng or Andre Drummond on, considering both were eventually bought out. Who in the hell looks at Steven Adams making $65 million over 3 seasons and thinks ""he's worth giving up quality rotation players and picks for""? That should have been a fireable offense, especially when coupled with the SVG disaster."
Did Nerlens Noel play like shit this year? Did Ivica Zubac? Did Dwight Howard? Cause those three guys combined made less money than Adams did by himself. $20+ million for a traditional center is a ludicrous overpay. Sorry.
"Oh yeah teams are gonna be dying to trade for 30 year outdated center that makes 17 million. Nerlens Noel is a similar, possibly better player and won‚Äôt even make that type of money in free agency."
"&gt; Wiggins won ROTY and look what happened then.  A remember that in 2014-15, the race was basically Wiggins vs Nerlens Noel, and many Sixers fans were pissed that Noel didn't win it. Then both guys ended up being bums."
Giannis with the Nerlens Noel special.
Giannis is a suped up Nerlens Noel
"offensively in the half court in the playoffs, he's simply not an initiator. he's still dropping 30 spots on the regular, he's def not a role player lol  but some of the frustration for sure is watching how he's used and i'm not sure if it's his fault or the coaching staff, probably both. he should be prime amar'e on steroids while being an all nba level defender, so it's frustrating for us to watch him be nerlens noel on steroids instead"
"That we would be a contender with Dennis Smith Jr., Nerlens Noel and Justin Anderson as our ""core""."
"Nerlens Noel deserved a spot on the list... he had the second best defensive rating, third best defensive win shares and best defensive box plus/minus. I am kinda baffled Bam is considered better defensive centre than him"
Nerlens Noel robbed
"MCW, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, Fultz   Draft picks are hard to gauge. Worst thing the Sixers did during the process was give up Picks for Tobias and then give him a max, and then lose Jimmy.  Edit: Also the Mikal Bridges trade. Some questionable decisions from the FO but overall they‚Äôve still done pretty good."
"Very suprised Nerlens Noel didn‚Äôt even come CLOSE  Defensive anchor for a top 3 defense in the league, averaged 2.2 blocks, 1.1 steals, and was all over the court"
Imagine going from banging Nerlens Noel and Taj Gibson down low to banging Embiid.
Julius Randle getting more votes than Nerlens Noel is blasphemy.
"How was Nerlens Noel defense this season compared to guys like Embiid, Capela, Ayton, etc  Everytime I watch him he's pretty impressive"
"Dennis ""Nerlens Noel"" Schroder."
The nerlens Noel special
Nerlens Noel called and said.....bruh
"Holmes developed elsewhere, kind of like Jerami Grant and Nerlens Noel"
"Clippers need to get a defensive big, a Robin Lopez or Nerlens Noel so they can actually implement their switch defense. But idk what they can do about PG, he is who he is."
I mean to who though? I‚Äôm not disagreeing with the sentiment he won‚Äôt be in LA. But what garbage franchise wants that?  Even SacTown probably says no. Can‚Äôt imagine Houston or OKC getting involved unless picks come their way so I feel like this could just be a walk away Nerlens Noel type situation where the dude walked away from his bag.
"Randle, RJ, Mitch, Quickley, Obi, DRose, Nerlens, Vildoza, Burks would get protected  Noel, Elfrid, Bullock, Frank, Knox good bye"
Nerlens Noel: only player to average 2+ blocks and 1+ steals per game
No votes for Nerlens Noel?
nerlens noel in the entire first round against the hawks
"I‚Äôm starting to believe you don‚Äôt understand the basics of building a team. Vet minimums can pull extremely valuable players like Marc gasol, Kyle korver (too old now), Austin rivers, nerlens Noel.  You use these contracts to round out your team and complete the 8-12 spots in a rotation - not to sign a superstar. The warriors already have their starters in Steph, Klay, dray, wiseman, and Wiggins.   Look up hubris my guy"
"* Zach Lavine $19m a year. * Lu Dort $1.4m a year. * Brogdon $20m a year. * Myles Turner $17m a year. * Sabonis $19m a year. * Capela $18m a year. * DRose $7m a year. * Nerlens Noel $5m a year. * Monte Morris $9m a year. * Royce O‚ÄôNeal $8.5m a year. * Maxi Kleber $8m a year. * Dorian Finney-Smith $4m a year. * Serge Ibaka $9m a year.  Bogdan is a better player than some of these guys, but that doesn‚Äôt mean his contract is a better value."
are you suggesting Joel Embiid is better than Nerlens Noel???
oh jfc now I gotta go see if that was my dumbass since I was once completely onboard with Nerlens Noel and Okafor being the next Robinson and Duncan.
"Holy fuck that man took so much shit for being 1000% right. You can debate Jokic or Embiid plenty, but goddamn people saying Nerlens Noel is a better center üòÇüòÇ"
Nerlens Noel?
Nerlens Noel weighs 7 pounds and is a better rim protector than KAT.
"oh, the discounts weren't just in philly. I got courtside seats for only 100 bucks in DC, and i got to watch john wall make gravy out of nerlens noel and jahlil okafor. it was awesome.  same against LAC at staples, I saw De'Andre Jordan dunk SEVEN times on those poor babies, and tickets were dirt cheap compared to everything else at Staples."
"Tell that to Nerlens Noel, went from 70M offer to a minimum on a tear"
"If the Suns were playoff rejects then what were the Knicks? Knicks didn't even get invited to the bubble and next year make a Top 4 seed. Suns went undefeated in the bubble then added CP3 in the offseason, the Knicks added Alec Burks and Nerlens Noel in the offseason"
"&gt; And imaging if he got a major injury, at least he secured the bag  Luka is so hot right now - it doesn't matter. Just like the Nets signed KD on the 4 year max immediately after the most devastating injury in basketball, knowing full well that on year 1 they will pay him to rehab - so will 27 teams will try and give Luka the max even if he has an injury.  This scenario is something that should bother a player like Nerlens Noel, not a young superstar."
The difference between Nerlens Noel and Luka doesn‚Äôt need to be explained though. Luka could tear both ACLs and still get maxed by all 30 teams if he hit free agency. That security is why he could take the QO.
"Assuming Dame demands a trade:  - McCollum for RJ Barrett and Nerlens Noel (S&amp;T). - Dame for Bam, Duncan Robinson (S&amp;T works bc $5 mil cap hold), Herro, FRP (after OKC unprotects); throw in Nunn if Portland wants, they‚Äôll have to add salary filler. - Re-sign Powell.  Core Rebuild of Bam (23), Herro (21), Duncan (27), RJ Barrett (20), Nunn (25), Noel (25), Powell (28), FRP.  Who says no? Maybe the Knicks."
"Jarrett Allen is a solid defender and rebounder. If it was my team I would only consider defense first big men. If Turner isn't available I would be looking at Jarrett Allen, Isaiah Stewart, Robert Williams, and Nerlens Noel."
Thibs did McDiddly squat in Minny without a quality C rotation.   Adding Nerlens Noel over Kanter wouldve done more than adding Thibs instead of Stotts
Closest we'll get to that is probably like Nerlens Noel turning down that huge contract.
for 3 games 2 of our starters were elfrid payton and nerlens noel. lol. lots of room for improvement. im feeling better than i did a week ago.
I don‚Äôt think Claxton will be ready to be a starter next season so a rim protecting big man is probably our biggest need. Dedmon has looked pretty good from what I‚Äôve seen. So maybe him or Javale. Nerlens Noel would be incredible if we could pull that off.
That's how you end up like Nerlens Noel
The old Nerlens Noel free agency move
"Disagree quite a bit. Tim Duncan was an incredible defender but he's a big at the end of the day in a pre-Steph era.   He had great footwork, insane fundamentals and surprisingly good athleticism which meant he was far more than a mere rim-protector.   But still Dray is just a level above even Duncan in terms of his defensive IQ. It's one thing to have the mental ability to be position yourself well to contest a drive.   It's another to warp the offense to prevent that drive in the first place - and Dray is the orchestrator of such a thing.   Just look around and you'll see how a team like Warriors (with Looney as the only big at 6'8'') and no other all-nba defenders finishes as the 5th best defense in the league.   The only 4 better defenses were Lakers (a great defensive unit all throughout with great length), 76ers (with embiid, ben, matisse, Tobias, Dwight...), Utah (Gobert....), Knicks (with Nerlens Noel, Mitchell Rob, Taj etc...).   The Knicks surprise aside all these teams are legit defensive powerhouses with the personnel to be a league top defense.   Dray is the singular reason why a team with no length is the 5th best defense in the league."
- Anthony Davis - Julius Randle - Devine Booker - KAT - Rajon Rondo - Nerlens Noel - Tyler Herro - Bam Adebayo - Jamal Murray - Tyrese Maxey
"Trade CJ + whatever is reasonable for Jimmy Butler (assuming Miami is not willing to give him the full max extension he is seeking), re-sign Norm to start at the 2, add a defensive minded backup center like Nerlens Noel, and fill out the roster with whatever 3&amp;D wings they can get. Baby you got a stew going."
Ooooooo i remember that Nerlens Noel move.
"Imagine the ego of Schroder to turn down a 4 year/$80 mil + contract and then go on to be an absolute locker cancer and then not playing well at all.  He‚Äôs not gonna get anything near that contract he rejected, and I‚Äôm sure the Lakers have taken it off the table as well.  He‚Äôs not going to be Nerlens Noel 2.0 because he‚Äôs a PG and not a C, but he‚Äôs gonna regret this year."
I guarantee someone has said it. They just weren‚Äôt on camera like this fool was.  Your own fans in reference to nerlens Noel.   ‚ÄúThat same player is out here tripping people behind the play so yeah I hope he tears his acl‚Äù - /u/21dawg.   Your fans ain‚Äôt the innocent children you guys are claiming to be.
"Honestly, Barrett came off as real mature this series too. Most of the clown shit was Randle, Nerlens Noel and Bullock."
You'd think the Nerlens Noel situation would be a lesson to all future players but I guess not
What a fuck up on his part. Nerlens Noel level fuck up. He may never get an offer like that again.
Schroeder is lucky he's talented enough to trick some team into a new deal. Him passing up on the Lakers extension could've been the worst move since Nerlens Noel passing up that Mavs contract. He's been ass this series.
Not to sound like a hater but like...he‚Äôs probably closer to Nerlens Noel
He should ask Nerlens Noel how that goes.
Biggest fumbling of the bag since Nerlens Noel
Pulled a Nerlens Noel
&gt; Nobody turns down $44M guaranteed in this league unless they knew they were getting more.  Unless you're Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel turned down and extension because he thought he was worth more. Bam secured the bag.
Love seeing players make good business decisions instead of pulling a Nerlens Noel and turn down generational wealth
"realistically they could sign demar derozan and nerlens noel, that would make them better.   probably best to let THJ walk"
https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nr0y67/highlight_julius_randle_tosses_the_ball_at_trae/  You can actually see Nerlens Noel bump him in phantom cam!
"If Embiid stays healthy for the series, Atlanta will have a hell of a time trying to get the screens to work for Trae. Embiid is such a versatile defender, switches onto Young won't burn him. And he is someone Capela has to stay active on, Capela was basically a blocking and rebounding pylon during the Knicks series.   Taj Gibson and Nerlens Noel is a far cry from Dwight Howard and Joel Embiid. Atlanta need a HUGE boost from secondary point production to pull ahead in the series. Philly will not run out of good guards to throw against Young. I wanna say that Collins and Hunter will have to step up offensively, maybe get Bogdan some good looks from 3 and hopefully Lou will pulls out 6MOTY caliber performances in this series."
Lol @ the Nerlens Noel high school bully bump.
Nerlens Noel
"Tough look for u/lardbiscuits ‚ÄúAtlanta still sucks because Capela was never good in the first place. He's a glorified Nerlens Noel who was lucky to get fed lobs by Harden his whole career.  Gallo is old and they signed him to a three year deal. Not only is he going to be playing out of position (Capela, Collins and Gallo is a terrible 5-4-3 in today's NBA defensively), but he's going to decline before that deal is up.  They're about to hand a bag to the most overrated player in the NBA in Bogdan. The dude is a bad defender and borderline starter. He literally averages 14 points a game.  Kris Dunn literally can't score the ball.  They're going to stunt any hope they had of developing Cam and are still going to give up 130 points a game.‚Äù"
" I mean holy fuck, regular season Randle is what we‚Äôre gonna call him now since the dude is fucking ASS in the playoffs. Imagine talking all that shit and Deandre Hunter puts you in a fucking straight jacket in a must win game in front of your own crowd. Knicks are going back to being a poverty franchise because they‚Äôre building around RJ Bricks, a 32 year old PG with Blake Griffin knees and a one season wonder in Randle. You got clown ass Nerlens Noel talking shit too. Fucking laughable and their fans deserve all the pain from watching this series"
Nerlens Noel bout to go off and get himself ejected
Nerlens Noel  6‚Äô11‚Äù 158 lbs...
Who the fuck told you the Knicks are deeper? Cuz anyone who even pays a little bit of attention knows that‚Äôs not true at all. The Hawks splurged in FA last year and the Knicks signed Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel looks like the fish Will Smith played in shark tale
nerlens noel is so damn dirty kick his ass out of the league lmao
"In this scenario am I good at circumcisions or bad?  If I'm good? Clint Capela, he easily has the biggest dick on the Hawks.  If I'm bad? Nerlens Noel, because he's a bum."
Nerlens ‚ÄúCJ McCollum‚Äù Noel
He also tripped Trae in an earlier game this series. Nerlens Noel is a certified bitch.
Shocked Nerlens Noel and a 50 year old Taj Gibson aren't shutting him down.
"Yep, Nerlens Noel."
Nerlens Noel is such a bitch ass
Nerlens Noel fuckin hates these dudes lmao
Nerlens Noel is a multi level marketing scheme
"Hmm.... As a straight man... I'm gonna say Nerlens Noel or Kris Dunn, even though he hasn't played"
It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs not going to challenge anything they say and will happily report things he knows are false if it helps cultivate a source.   Happy Walters actually called him out for being a Rich Paul puppet when he hilariously tried to ‚Äúreport‚Äù that Nerlens Noel did not turn down a 70M contract.   https://mobile.twitter.com/Happywalters/status/901537244116262914
"yeah he could have a good season next year though, it might be in his interest to take a short term bridge deal hoping that he can still pull in one mega contract in his prime  look at all the people who clowned nerlens noel for giving up all that money, he played awesome this year to the point where I think there's almost certainly going to be a bidding war for him this offseason and he'll get 20m/yr for 3 or 4 years.  portland and dallas especially need his rim protection badly"
"I mean stotts has melo playing OK defense, the biggest problem is nurkic collects fouls and has to sit  You should honestly throw 20m/3yr at nerlens noel, there might be a bidding war between you and dallas for him  Backup center is the biggest position of need for you, theres nothing stotts can do without a reliable rim defender and nurkic has fouled out of like half the games this series or had to sit for extended stretches because he's so foul prone  If you had a better backup center than kanter you win tonight guaranteed"
Nerlens Noel too
Got that Oladipo and Nerlens Noel financial advice
Nerlens Noel has entered the chat
"I know people are saying his game won't age gracefully, but I could see him playing like DeRozan in a few years.  1st option worth 50 mil? No, but he could still be a valuable player if they manage to get a playmaking PG.  If they somehow got Lowry and Nerlens Noel, thats a scary team. (Lowry, Robinson, Butler, Bam, Noel is a really nice starting 5, IMO)"
"Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes and Dwight Howard are all unrestricted free agents this summer. I'd happily take any of them over Drummond."
"Nerlens Noel stepped  on Huerter‚Äôs hand. That‚Äôs why he grabbed Noel‚Äôs leg. He Deserved a flagrant, but I am glad he stood up for himself. And as I said to my friend at the game who is  a Knicks fan. ‚ÄúThey just goofed.‚Äù You don‚Äôt want to see Red Velvet angry."
I wonder how tough he'd be talking if he was playing against an actual starter-quality center instead of the corpse of Taj Gibson and a wax statue of Nerlens Noel.  Good luck against Philly big guy.
"The Knicks set the tone early with Randle hitting Bogi in the face in game 1 then Nerlens tripping Trae the next game. Don't start shit and act all tough if you can't handle it on the other end. Better yet, play better basketball if you want to win games lol. Hawks havent really initiated anything, mostly just retaliation for the clown behavior of Noel Randle and Bullock throughout the series"

But Rich Paul has never made a mistake in his life so he can't emphasize.               Nerlens Noel Says Hello
Nerlens Noel says hi
That's a Nerlens Noel decision right there
KP got his max deal from Dallas and then disappeared. If I was a Mav's fan I would be absolutely livid for getting fleeced. Guys are better off with Nerlens Noel.
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuruw5lIjjo does this count?  Nerlens fouls to the ground, but in terms of contact done by the defender, it's the amount as Crowder imo. Huerter is smaller than Noel, while Crowder is a similar size to LeBron. Huerter's hands don't follow thru on the foul.   The difference between the wrap-ups is whether the scorer fell down."
Funny enough Nerlens Noel would be perfect for this Dallas team.
"I think you are having a laugh assuming high school players--unless they are pro level high school players of course--would look better than nerlens noel on ball.  We disagree, which is fine. But this isn't a super subjective point, imo.  NBA level skill is obscene."
"Robin is an identical twin of a guy who is incredibly fluid and skilled for a big guy, so as goofy as he is, I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if he had some less-showcased ability.  But there‚Äôs no way someone like Nerlens Noel is a better shooter or ball handler than the D-III guard types you see in open gym. Even good HS players are better at these fundamentals, if less able to actualize it due to lack of size."
"I was all in on Nerlens Noel. In all fairness to him he‚Äôs come back nicely from injuries/contract debacle and is probably the player he was always destined to become in the NBA, but I was on the DPOY / this guy is special wagon in like 2014-15.    I was also high on Thomas Robinson and Mario Hezonja. Good times."
"Guard - CJ McCollum (creation/shooting/handles) and Tony Allen (defense, size, hustle, leadership). Easy 2-way all star, someone every team would want. CJ with TAs transition game would be fun to watch as well. Wing - Gerald Wallace (defense, athleticism, rebounding, hustle) and Rashard Lewis(shooting, size, handle). 2 of my favorites from the era, the combo can hit any shot at any time, absolute madman on D.  Center - Enes Kanter (rebounding, size, post, hands, hustle) and Nerlens Noel (lob threat, rim protection, length, mobility, defense in general) just a player I'd love to see. Probably puts up a 14/14 and is a beast on the paint on both ends."
Nerlens Noel too
"[Per basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_per_minute.html), Timelord was 3rd in blocks per 36 min: Daniel Gafford - 3.4; Nerlens Noel - 3.3 (3.28); Timelord - 3.3 (3.32).    This doesn‚Äôt take into account pace, however. The Knicks were one of the slowest teams in the league last year, so this downplays Nerlens‚Äô impact a bit. If you look at blocks per 100 possessions, the Nerlens Wall is first: Noel - 4.6; Gafford - 4.5; Timelord - 4.5."
Where is Nerlens Noel?
definitive answer:   ||PLAYER|TEAM|AGE|GP|BLK| --:|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:| |1|Myles Turner|IND|25|47|3.4| |2|Rudy Gobert|UTA|29|71|2.7| |3|Nerlens Noel|NYK|27|64|2.2| |4|Clint Capela|ATL|27|63|2| |5|Chris Boucher|TOR|28|60|1.9| |6|Jakob Poeltl|SAS|25|69|1.8| |7|Robert Williams III|BOS|23|52|1.8| |8|Anthony Davis|LAL|28|36|1.6| |9|Jaren Jackson Jr.|MEM|21|11|1.6| |10|Richaun Holmes|SAC|27|61|1.6| |11|Brook Lopez|MIL|33|70|1.5| |12|Mitchell Robinson|NYK|23|31|1.5| |13|Jarrett Allen|CLE|23|63|1.4| |14|Daniel Gafford|WAS|22|54|1.4| |15|Joel Embiid|PHI|27|51|1.4| |16|Kristaps Porzingis|DAL|25|43|1.3| |17|Goga Bitadze|IND|21|45|1.3| |18|Kevin Durant|BKN|32|35|1.3| |19|Hassan Whiteside|SAC|32|36|1.3| |20|Isaiah Stewart|DET|20|68|1.3| |21|Mo Bamba|ORL|23|46|1.3|
"Purely shot blockers:   Myles Turner, Mitchell Robinson, Nerlens Noel, Chris Boucher, Rudy Gobert, Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capella all come to mind. All of them are great at block shots eplicitly. But not all of them are elite level interior defenders &amp; rim protectors.   Best rim protectors/interior defenders is a similar list, but it excludes players who are great at getting blocks but not doing much else defensively. That list for me would be:   Rudy Gobert, Clint Capella, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, Bam Adebayo etc..."
Nerlens Noel is also noticeably absent
"I didn‚Äôt know how good he was offensively. Nerlens is a one-way player, can‚Äôt catch the ball if his life depended on it (not exaggerating, Knicks fans know what I‚Äôm talking about).   If you‚Äôre telling me Williams is basically a two-way version of Noel, this contract is a steal. I‚Äôm impressed with what Brad Stevens has done this offseason."
"I understand he‚Äôs better than Nerlens offensively, since Noel struggles a lot with just catching a ball. As far as vertical spacing and rim running, Nerlens isn‚Äôt that good at it.   I didn‚Äôt know Robert Williams had that type of impact on offense. 54M over 4 years is indeed a steal for the Celtics."
"How is this contract considered a steal and the Nerlens Noel one a big overpay. Didn‚Äôt watch the Celtics this year, so I‚Äôm genuinely asking."
Nerlens Noel is the only player qualified to answer this.
"Ive seen Nerlens Noel do some things on defense that I've never seen anyone do before. His footwork and hands are supernatural for someone of his size. Like if bigman steals is a skill, i feel like he could be HOF."
"duncan robinson, eric bledsoe, nerlens noel, marcus morris, and kevin huerter"
"PG - Ben Simmons  SG - Andre Roberson   SF - Rondae Hollis-Jefferson  PF - Jonathan Isaac  C - Bam Adebayo  Bench - Kris Dunn, Matisse Thybulle, Derrick Jones Jr, Michael Kidd-Gilchrest,  Nerlens Noel.   I'm not sure how this team would ever score, but I think they could win one defensive slugfest against a bad team where they just hold them to like 80 and get a bunch of transition buckets"
"&gt;Has anything like this ever happened?  Yes, plenty of times, since retiring numbers wasn't a big thing for about the first 40 years of the NBA.  Gail Goodrich's #25 was worn by 5 different Lakers including Mitch Kupchak and Eddie Jones before they eventually got around to retiring it.  Dwight Jones wore Chamberlain's #13 with the Lakers in 1983.  Mike Smrek and Samaki Walker wore Jamaal Wilkes' #52 before it was retired.  And that's just a sampling from the Lakers' history.  Six Celtics wore Cedric Maxwell's #31 between his retirement and his number retirement.  Same deals for #21 and #22 in Boston, and lots of others around the league.  To the best of my knowledge, the record is the 12 different 76ers who have worn Dolph Schayes' #4 jersey -- with the last being Nerlens Noel."
Maybe their situation would have been different if their GM wasn‚Äôt replaced in the middle of the Process.   You mentioned Nerlens Noel. Colangelo traded away a 22 year old Nerlens Noel for Andrew Bogut and Justin Anderson. Four days later they waived Bogut.   Colangelo also traded up to pick Markelle Fultz  Who knows what would have happened if they didn‚Äôt cut their tank short?
"&gt;LeBron started something in controlling his narrative and limiting access that all the biggest players are emulating in one way or another at this point.  Sure, but I think there is more to it when it comes to player movement because, traditionally, the media needs to balance the access/positive coverage quid prior quo among competing groups.  For example, if Player A is on Team X, both the player and the team want media members pushing the narrative that helps them the most. This means that media members need to perform a balancing act. If they always push the narrative too far in the player's direction, they risk losing out on access to the team's front office.  LeBron really distorts this dynamic though. His ability to generate views/clicks/traffic is so huge that it doesn't matter if you piss off other teams or not. Access to Lebron is worth more than access to any of the teams so it throws the balance out of whack and allows Klucth to create narratives that nobody else could get away with.  As a good example, look at my other response in this thread to the Nerlens Noel situation with the Mavs. It is crazy how many people misremember the facts of what actually happen and pretty much all of the made-up ""facts"" happen to make Klutch look better.   I don't know many times that I can recall where a player lost out of tens of millions and you had a shit ton of people misremember facts in a way that supported a narrative that benefited an agent. Maybe that has nothing to do with LeBron and maybe Klutch will be able to pull that shit off going forward, but I'll believe it when I see it."
"Nerlens Noel, Mitchell Robinson are top defenders at their position. Reggie Bullock was a solid defender last year, Elfrid payton (despite being garbage) is a decent defender, RJ is coming to his own on defense. Miles McBride looks like he has the tools to be a great defender."
I don't think anyone is really wishing extreme misfortune on Schroeder but it's still funny to bet on yourself and fail so miserably. In a month something else will Hakeem and it'll be a forgotten meme. I bet Nerlens Noel is having a laugh about all this.
Evan turner   Tyreke evans   Jabari Parker   Jahlil okafor   Nerlens noel
He's getting paid more in one season than Nerlens Noel made his entire career so far.

"&gt;noel  Wait, Nerlens Noel?!"
"Can he still give you 13&amp;7 in 20min off the bench?  Last season in 25min as a starter he only gave you 12/7, hard to imagine him putting up the same numbers or better in a lesser role.  As for the Knicks, no way.  Defense was such a huge part of the reason we overachieved last year.  Our backup center is whoever doesn't start between Nerlens Noel and Mitchell Robinson, and I'd definitely rather have either of them than Love.  We did enough to bolster our offensive this offseason, we need to still keep our defense sharp."

"PG: Lebron James-$39  SG: Jamal Murray- $7  SF: Kevin Durant- $42  PF: Marcus Morris- $12  C: Nerlens Noel -$8  Bench:  Landry Shamet- $3  Bobby Portis - $3  Alex Caruso- $6  Not as beefy frontcourt wise as some of the other teams I see here and Bron's age/durability is worrying, but besides that, this is unstoppable."
"Credit to OP for the awesome structure and idea.  Starting LineUp:  PG: Kemba Walker 10  SG: James Harden 38  SF: LeBron James 39  PF: Marcus Morris 12  C: Nerlens Noel 8  Bench:  Guards: Grayson Allen 4  Wings: Josh Hart 6  Bigs: Bobby Portis 3  First of all I wanted to say awesome job OP, definitely looks like you worked hard on this list and I like it. Also, side note I think you mistook Troy Brown Jr for Bruce Brown Jr. I probably spent more time than I should‚Äôve at this so I hope you guys enjoy.  Anyways, for my team. I went with the approach that‚Äôs been working most for basically the past decade and more now, LeBron plus shooting and playmaking.  Team Reasons:  My strategy was picking up guys who I thought was the best bang for your buck, who I thought were huge steals and honestly I think a lot of these guys are undervalued.  Kemba Walker for 10 is a steal, this is still someone with excellent on ball and off ball guard ability who can average 20ish PPG in that role doing so. He can take pressure off Harden &amp; LeBron.  James Harden is I think the best SG in the game and his scoring and playmaking ability never to someone like LeBron would be amazing like we‚Äôve seen similarly with Chris Paul in the past. He‚Äôd make everyone around him better and scores with ease.  LeBron James age may hurt him but I‚Äôm a strong believer in him. I think he‚Äôll still be as good as ever and at the very highest a step slower but that‚Äôs still a damn good player. His playmaking ability next to this team will be huge.  Marcus Morris for 12 is a huge steal. He averaged 20ish PPG on the Knicks and is an amazing shooter who‚Äôs proven he can play with multiple wings as a small ball C or a wing in general.  Nerlens Noel is someone who I think can thrive as a starter especially next to James Harden. His defence is definitely good enough to sustain a starting spot.  Bench:  Grayson Allen I think is someone who you undervalued OP because he was a starter on a playoff team who averaged 11 PPG shooting lights out from 3, 39% making 2 a game. He also has good enough playmaking ability and to do stuff off the dribble.  Bobby Portis per 36 stats last season he was second in the league in points off the bench and first in rebounding for 3 BP is amazing. Good floor spacer too if Nerlens isn‚Äôt playing well.  Josh Hart or Terrence Ross I couldn‚Äôt decide between. They‚Äôre the same price but I‚Äôm not sure if Ross as a 6th man is a better fit or Hart as a small ball lineup player. I think id go with Hart because of his rebounding even though TRoss is a bigger name.  I think this team has the perfect amount of playmaking, scoring, floor spacing and just enough defence to help them. I‚Äôd honestly say this is the best team anyone can come up with but I do not wanna get ahead of myself."
Wiggins man. Dude literally stopped trying to poster after Nerlens Noel.
"When the Rockets went ultra small, I think they were counting on being able to get Nerlens Noel from the Thunder. They didn't want to be center-less, but they couldn't land the rim runner they wanted. If they had, it would've made a substantial difference to the team and narrative."
"Bluntly, would the Warriors have given him a max contract ?  Being part of The Process earned him around $200 million dollars, because after their several failed picks  - Nerlens Noel, Markelle Fultz, Michael Carter Williams, Jahlil Okafor - Philly were desperate enough to lock down one of their semi-successes to a long term deal."
"Well unfortunately for Schroeder, it's still the most recent thing he's done in his career, so it's gonna stick with him until he can rebuild his reputation like Nerlens Noel did."
"some combo of:  Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks, RJ Barrett (maybe), Immanuel Quickley (maybe), Obi Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, any of our future picks, Miles McBride, Quinton Grimes, Jericho Sims  I don't think it beats the Sixers package if they offer Simmons + another player + picks"
Have you heard of the Nerlens Noel saga?
According to [The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/8/29/16222076/nerlens-noel-qualifying-offer-dallas-mavericks) Nerlens fired Happy Walters and hired Klutch after he turned down the Mavs offer but before he signed - Rich Paul told him as a condition of taking him on as a client he had to be a FA the next year so he signed the one year offer.
Nerlens Noel can finally breathe easy now
Nerlens Noel off the hook.
"The Nerlens Noel thing was kinda sad. At the time it happened it didn't seem totally stupid. He bet on himself in the the purest way, in a sense.  Schroder is an asshole with a big ego and I'm glad he got burned lmao I hate that I have to root for this goofy hair schnitzel clown mf for a year"
He and Nerlens Noel can go out to commiserate.
nerlens noel.
"Nobody clowned Nerlens Noel nearly this much, did they?"
Nerlens Noel 2.0
"Yeah, this might not be as bad as Nerlens Noel. Noel will have made [59 million *through the end of his new contract*](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/new-york-knicks/nerlens-noel-13319/cash-earnings/) less than he could have had in one contract."
Nerlens Noel 2.0 finally found a team?  Badass dude
"sorry but nah Noel is still way, way worse and it's not particularly close  Dennis turned down $84 million but he has already made about $70 million in his career  Noel turned down $70 million. He had only made $11 million in his career at that point. As of today his career earnings are $37 million.  If we're ranking bag fumbles, Nerlens is still king idiot."
Nerlens Noel I remember turned down like $70 million from the Mavs that he never got back too. What are some other instances like that? I‚Äôm struggling to think of some of the others even though I know they exist.
Biggest L since Nerlens Noel
"This reminds me of Nerlens Noel a few years ago when he turned down a $70 million contract from the mavs, only to end up accepting the qualifying offer lmao."
Even Nerlens Noel thinks Schroeder is an idiot.
"Exactly, these problem dudes are calling the shots more than the agents.  Oladipo wanted to get to Miami by any means necessary and Schroeder has a history of character issues. No different than Nerlens Noel or Latrell sprewell situations"
Smells a lot like the Nerlens Noel situation. For what Schroeder is he might not be 5 year 80 million good. He's a 6th man who thinks he's an all star.
Dude went to the Nerlens Noel school of negotiating lmao
Some real Nerlens Noel energy here
He must not know Nerlens Noel personally. He made the same mistake a few years ago.
"Finally figured out what Nerlens Noel, Dennis Schroder, and Sprewell have in common."
Nerlens Noel type beat
Didn‚Äôt Nerlens Noel do the same thing?
the Nerlens Noel special is now the Dennis Schroeder special
This dumbass 100% pulled a Nerlens Noel on himself.   Good job.
I'll never forget this article.  https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2017/9/1/16218852/what-if-the-nerlens-noel-negotiations-were-on-shark-tank-dallas-mavericks-mark-cuban
Nerlens Noel
"Schroeder is hands down the winner of the Nerlens Noel ""negotiate against yourself"" contract award for this year."
It didnt work for Nerlens Noel lmao
&gt; There's confidence and then there's arrogance  He should have learned from Nerlens Noel.  People get that once chance for a bag and he completely blew it.
"It is likely that Schroeder himself is the one who wanted to turn it down and bet on himself instead of his agent. I know because he hasn't fired his agent yet.  Nerlens Noel decline his extension, fired his agent, then went with Klutch Sports after he tried to bet on himself, and the result was about 4 million dollars in 3 years. Thankfully he finally found a bag of money but actually much less than if he had taken that extension from Dallas."
*Nerlens Noel.
"nerlens noel...  didn't take the 70mil like his agent told him to, then he fired him.  he has since fired rich paul too.."
Man coulda been stealing cheques like Eric Bledsoe but ended up going Nerlens Noel.
He should have spoken with Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel must be happy that he‚Äôs no longer associated with majorly fumbling the bag
"3 first round picks in a row were injured their first season, I also think nerlens Noel"
"That's got to be on the Mount Rushmore of bad sports contracts or decisions...plus Scottie Pippen, Nerlens Noel,....."
Thank you Lakers for not making me into a Nerlens Noel story
"Thank you for asking!  (in no particular order)  PG - Curry, Simmons, Fox, Killian Hayes, Rubio  SG - Kelly Oubre, Jalen Green, Lavine, Booker, Oladipo  SF - Tatum, Giannis, Aaron Gordon, Abdul Nader, Hayward  PF - Kuzma, Kevin Love, Hachimura, Ibaka, Obi Toppin  C - Nerlens Noel, Robert Williams III, Rudy Gobert, Daniel Gafford, Jarrett Allen"
Yeah he doesn't dunk like that anymore after almost killing Nerlens Noel. https://youtu.be/qluyhf6SDSU
He also started following Nerlens Noel yesterday
can we use more prediction polls to get some real time litmus tests on narratives as they develop? Right now the only way to do that is to look back on all threads and read through hundreds of comments.   for example - right now Schroeders FA is a booming meme - we should get a poll up now to see  whether the sub thinks he will get his value back up or end up like Nerlens Noel ie perennial back up.
**2015-2016 NBA Season**  |Rk|Player|Pos|FG%| |-:|:-|:-|-:| |1|DeAndre Jordan|C|.703| |2|Dwight Howard|C|.620| |3|Hassan Whiteside|C|.606| |4|Enes Kanter|C|.576| |5|Marcin Gortat|C|.567| |6|Jonas Valanciunas|C|.565| |7|Kenneth Faried|PF|.558| |8|Karl-Anthony Towns|C|.542| |9|Robin Lopez|C|.539| |10|Gorgui Dieng|C|.532| |11|Greg Monroe|C|.522| |12|Andre Drummond|C|.521| |13|Nerlens Noel|C|.521| |14|LeBron James|SF|.520| |15|Derrick Favors|PF|.515| |16|Thaddeus Young|PF|.514| |17|LaMarcus Aldridge|PF|.513| |18|Nikola Jokic|C|.512| |19|Brook Lopez|C|.511| |20|Nikola Vucevic|C|.510| |21|Jahlil Okafor|C|.508| |22|Kawhi Leonard|SF|.506| |23|Giannis Antetokounmpo|PG|.506| |24|Kevin Durant|SF|.505| |25|Al Horford|C|.505| |26|Stephen Curry|PG|.504|  So by your measure Steph was the 26th best shooter in the league during his 2015-2016 season?
"What makes it even worse is when we make decent signings, we get clowned with ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get *insert random star FA* so you overpay this guy LOLknicks‚Äù. It‚Äôs so annoying. I remember when Laker fan accounts were talking shit and making memes about us giving Nerlens Noel a contract last offseason.   I get Knick fans are brash and sometimes overly reactionary, but I‚Äôm sick of this idea that the majority of us are delusional. Every fanbase has delusional stans. That‚Äôs just how it goes."
Can‚Äôt be as bad as Nerlens Noel
"Literally no one gives af about Nerlens Noel ;mao  People bring up Noel only in passing when referencing Schroder; there weren't thousands of posts about Noel like there is Schroder. Noel had a shittier leg to stand on in his bet for more money that would warrant more criticism (because iirc his career earnings are way worse than Schroder's) and he still is rarely brought up.  And what are you even trying to imply with that non sequitur? How did you interpret that as someone being 'triggered'? The salient point was that the fans are the consumers of all things related to LA yet complain when the NBA &amp; ESPN market LA more than others, and the Schroder situation is an example."
"The problem is that the qualifying system wouldn't allow for NBA players to participate.   That said, I think a team something along the lines of:  Nerlens Noel-Mikal Bridges-Derrick White would be a fun team."
Nerlens Noel was memed just as much for doing the same thing. And he played in OKC  He still is now  You seem to be triggered
Mark offered Nerlens Noel 4/70 or some shit and Noel turned us down LOL
"Thats what I thought too, I saw Naz Reid a bit last season and I thought hey that guy shoots the 3 nicely  I always thought Nerlens Noel would be a pretty good fit next to KAT, he defends well and won't take too many shots away from the rest of the guys."
"Nerlens Noel, no longer holds title for declining his Mavs contract."
Nerlens Noel has good footwork but terrible touch.
EXPANSION TEAM: The LA Dreamers  Roster currently constructed sits at:  Delusional Schroeder Blouse Simmons Potentially Nerlens Noel
turned down 5/80 (16 per year) and is *scheduled to make* 6/78 (13 per year) with the Lakers once his contract is up. An L but maybe living in LA makes up the difference for him.  Nerlens Noel turned down 4/70 (17.5 per year) and has made 5/17.3 (3.46 per year) bouncing around teams. Massive L
The Nerlens Noel of point guards
"Guys who did the ‚Äúi‚Äôll bet on myself, so i can make more money‚Äù worse? Nerlens Noel when the Mavericks offered him 4 for 70 or Dennis Schroder who turned down 4 for 84? I‚Äôll say Schroder at least Noel got kinda paid this offseason with the Knicks, but it took him like 4 years to recover! Schroder will be 31-32 ish in 4 years lol"
*Nerlens noel has entered the chat* üòà
Nerlens Noel gave him some hot dogs he keeps in there for midgame snacks
"I think its completely fair for people to be hard on Wiseman. imo if a teams gonna draft a big with a top 3 pick, especially with skilled gaurds left on the board, you need them to be good. Low level starting bigs can be easy to find (look at the thunder, how much better has wiseman been then Roby or Brown?). Bigs are much easier to replace.  The warriors have been so bad with steph on the bench, imagine if they had Lamelo to fill those mintues and a Nerlens Noel to fill wisemans minutes."
He really shied away from trying to posterize people after he [almost killed Nerlens Noel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6S2N2-_pUE).
"I think we have different definitions of greatness. Nerlens noel did things like that as a rookie too, but he isn't a superstar. Any kid that gets drafted that high is going to have some natural athletic ability, but he hasn't shown me that he's going to be a great basketball player"
and they had rik smuts giant ass  imagine Nerlens Noel trying to body this dude up üòÇ
Celtics fans propping up Robert Williams like he isn‚Äôt a poor man‚Äôs Nerlens Noel and then act shocked when he gets called for obvious fouls on an MVP candidate who has 5 inches and 50 pounds on him
"Mo Bamba, Nerlens Noel, Myles Turner, etc. The league is, in fact, 90% pretty good 5's."
"&gt; Nerlens Noel  That's a good one. Also a #6 pick, perhaps a little more expectations on the offensive end, got a little too much attention for his contract disaster, but don't look now the dude is playing really well in 2021.  He perhaps didn't live up to the hype, but he did get better."
Nerlens Noel
"Remember when Minnesota thought it was doing that by picking Jonny  Flynn and Ricky Rubio  Or Philly picking nerlens Noel, Okafor and embiid ?"
"Players with no basketball iq don't last anymore, or at the very least are incredibly noticeable now more than ever to the point where they get benched. I get they want Wiseman to develop but if you aren't savvy enough on at least one end of the court then there's no development that can save you. For example a guy like Nerlens Noel, watching that Knicks-Nets game tonight at the very least he didn't hijack the offense and for the most part tried his best on defense, was a bit sloppy on a few rotations to hunt for blocks, in short he played within himself. Wiseman appears to not even understand how to play within himself on a team with the greatest shooter of all time and if that in itself isn't concerning then there's no argument that will work to convince this sub that Wiseman is playing like boiled ass."
"You are hilarious. Even though you claim to listen to his podcast you don‚Äôt know that LEBRON uses RAPM as a base. Comparing it to RAPM would be the most idiotic thing ever in the short term. The whole point of stat like LEBRON and RAPTOR is that you don‚Äôt have to use RAPM Because of its extreme noise level.   DBPM has Nerlens Noel as the best defender in the league. If he actually suggested comparing it to that, LEBRON in itself is useless.   PIPM doesn‚Äôt exist anymore so I have no idea how you would compare it to that. (It‚Äôs almost like you dont know what you are talking about)  It‚Äôs funny that he says his own model sucks. I would like some source on that, because that sounds like the most incredibly dumb thing I have heard in a while.  And when you say that my eye test means nothing to me it kinds of tells me you are a massive homer that already made up his mind and it doesn‚Äôt matter what any stat or any else say. Which is pretty pathetic."
&gt; He‚Äôs lookin like Nerlens Noel out there lol  Wasn't Nerlens a good defender from Day 1?
Wiseman has pretty little value right now though. He‚Äôs lookin like Nerlens Noel out there lol
thibs really hates nerlens noel
"Robinson and Noel combined average 13.1/14.1 with 3.5 blocks   Clint averages 15.1/14.1 with 2.3 blocks alone  If the Hawks had to replace with either of those players, they'd have a significant downgrade.  No knock on Mitch or Nerlens, Clints just a much better player."
"He is essentially Deandre Jordan. A rim running lob threat that has great defense. He‚Äôs a solid center that is very good and efficient at what he does.   He‚Äôs properly rated. His skill set could be replaced. If the hawks had to replace him with someone like... Mitch Robinson or Nerlens Noel, how much is lost in terms of actual wins?"
"Like 2 years ago he tried to dunk over nerlens Noel and inadvertently elbowed him on the head. Noel got knocked out and had to be stretchered off the court. Here‚Äôs the play;  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qluyhf6SDSU  I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen wiggins try to poster anyone since this play, and I honestly think this might have rattled him a little and deterred him from going for posters anymore"
Without looking who do you think is fourth?   My guess is Nerlens Noel
"Besides his terrible handles, I also think his dunk on Nerlens Noel killed the little ""killer instinct"" he had. He seemed to attack the rim even less after that happened."
Good luck - see Nerlens Noel
I instantly was reminded of nerlens Noel. This may blow up in his face.
Hinkie traded their 22yo All-Star guard for Nerlens Noel and a first. Hinke would have probably traded Shai before the season began.
What does Nerlens Noel have to do with KP?
"Honest question  Is there ANYONE that has watched basketball in the past 5 years, that would take nerlens noel over KP? I think even NN own family would still take KP"
"&gt;As if RJ is playing with some elite teammates right now. He shares a fucking backcourt with Elfrid Payton. Randle is a great player to play with, he is not representative for the rest of our roster tho  Mitchell Robinson,IQ and Nerlens Noel weren't good teammates to have also for most of the season?"
Nerlens Noel and Reggie Bullock
"Noel's first two years in the league he averaged 1.8spg in 30mpg, Jokic this year in 36 minutes is averaging 1.6. Noel just doesn't get minutes. Nerlens' career STL% of 2.8 beats Jokic's STL% this season of 2.2. A STL% of 2.2 is Nerlens' career low."
This is just a lie when deflections and steals monster like even Nerlens Noel are around lol
"Is Claxton a better Nerlens Noel? I am Twolves fan, I know I know, so I don't know much about Claxton. I also would love to have defensive center on this trash pile of a Twolves team to pair with KAT"
"Did you not read my post? I said he isnt a great anchor and there so many reasons why.  But your center does not need to be your anchor.   And while he is not a great (for so many reasons that would even mess with the best defensive centers outside embiid and gobert) anchor, he is a good shot blocker and he is good at making people miss at the rim.  He is also way better at switching than almost every starting center, but we never switched until now.  He is better at defending the perimeter than most centers.  Kat was in Thibs system for 2.2 seasons not 3. and the part of the third season Jimmy was literally sabotaging our games like harden did at the beginning of the year lol.  Our starters for were Jeff teague, ( one of the worst pg defenders in the league, watch the pacers series vs kyrie) Jimmy (elite, seriously nuts lol but he missed almost 30 games that season), Wiggins (below average and at the time many people considered him one of the worst defenders in the league, seriously go look at posts from 2016-2017.) Taj (who was a great defender for the bulls was average at best for the wolves.  He offered near 0 rim protection which is what the wolves need in a 4.he was significantly better at offense for us) and then KAT.  Then dont forget our bench who also played tons of minutes with KAT.  It was Jamal Crawford, Bjelica, Tyus Jones, Shabazz muhommad, aaron brooks, marcus georges-hunt.  They were all bad to awful defenders.  Most of them are out of the league.  Jamal crawford was literally the worst in the league lol.  You cant have a good defense with that many players being terrible.  They also had gorgui tho who was a good defender they just never shared the floor that season.  and this was the best cast of defensive players he has ever players with.  The Jazz team now is so much better defensively than this.  Ya harden is a bad matchup for gobert because he cant make up for his perimeter players not good enough defense.  Same thing with Jamal. Thats the whole point, not sure how you missed it, but he can make up for it by switching onto them, but he is not good enough at that (neither is towns obviously).  KAT has the same defensive FG% at the rim as nerlens noel, porzingis and is better than Bam even.  So he definitely effects shots at the rim.  Those player are all considered good to great defenders.  Kat is a solid defender. He is good not great though and once he finally gets to play a system for a long period of time and that fits his skillsuit he will thrive.  Especially if/when we have a strong vet anchor at the 4.  Thibs is a good defensive coach for some players.  He knows 1 way to play tho (well he did when he was a twolves coach, maybe he has been diff for the knicks).  And if you want to win a championship you need to be able to play multiple types of defenses or atleast be able to change your defensive game plan to fit your star players and thibs didnt want to do that.  This is in my opinion is why thibs has never won a championship as a head coach and he never will (unless he changes)."
We start Elfrid Payton and Nerlens Noel. It's gotta be us
Didn't Nerlens Noel take the QO in Dallas a few years ago? Didn't exactly work out for him. Ballsy move tho
Because he had to face lingering injury issues and a rotation of established vets of Theis and Thompson compared to Nerlens Noel
Schroeder bout to be the next nerlens noel.
"Nerlens Noel whispers: ""Dennis, go for the max.  Don't sell yourself short."""
Nerlens noel should call this man asap
Until there isn't and you are Nerlens Noel.

"The process was 3 years and the worst of those years gave opportunities to a lot of guys who wouldn‚Äôt have made it otherwise. That 10 win team featured TJ McConnell, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Jakarr Sampson, Nerlens Noel, Robert Covington, Richaun Holmes who have all signed second contracts and established themselves in this league"
This isn‚Äôt fair man. Smh. Hate it for Mitch and idk how we‚Äôre supposed to make the playoffs with Taj Gibson and Nerlens Noel at center.
Man we really have to try and make a playoff push with Taj Gibson and Nerlens Noel at the 5.
Reminds me of when Nerlens Noel decided to test the market.
Cody Zeller is not better than Nerlens Noel LMAO I cannot believe you actually think that  Have fun overpaying for Andre Drummond or Daniel Theis or some shit
How would you feel about  Nerlens Noel + Mavs 1st for Devonte Graham + CHA 2nd
Devonte for Nerlens Noel. + a player is more realistic as I don't think the Knicks would trade Mitch for a (currently) inefficient guard coming off the bench. He'd easily be the best center on the Hornets right away too
Nowell messing with me. For a moment I thought the wolves acquired Nerlens Noel.
He had one earlier in the season against nerlens noel.
Now do Nerlens Noel
"On a similar note, Nerlens Noel is fourth in the league in blocks per game, averaging 2.0 a game despite only playing 22.2 MPG, which puts him at 157th in minutes per game. He is second in the league in block percentage with 8.9% (behind Myles Turner) and third in the league in defensive rating with 102.4 (behind Rudy Gobert and Anthony Davis)."
Capela only got about $17M and he's what we dream for Williams to be.   Nerlens Noel got $5M and he's a solid version of that spectrum of player.   Given that he hasn't made big money yet and he has health/injury concerns I think that if Boston put something like 4 years $28M with a player option on the 4th year then he would have to strongly consider it.
"i remember Nerlens Noel turning down 70 million from the Mavs, but the 40 million must have hurt too in retrospective. But can understand where Cousins was coming from. He thought he could get back on track."
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
Schr√∂der isn‚Äôt that good at lobs. He never developed chemistry with Steven Adams or Nerlens Noel in 3 years with OKC
"Jrue Holiday from Philly to New Orleans has a crazy web too. That was in 2013.  Philly got Nerlens Noel and and a future 1st from New Orleans.   The future 1st was used on Elfrid Payton who was instantly traded to Orlando for Dario Saric, a future 1st, and a future 2nd (lol).   THAT future 1st was used on Shamet, who was traded for Harris.  Dario was traded for Butler, who was traded for Richardson, who was traded for Curry.   The future 2nd in that deal was traded to the Knicks for two future 2nds. One of those 2nds was traded to Dallas in the Curry deal, we still have the other one.   And of course Jrue was traded to Milwaukee for the boatload of picks, so the web will continue on for years."
Nerlens Noel has played massive minutes since Mitch got hurt and has done really well.
Don‚Äôt doubt that LeBron has been great on defence this season but defensive stats are basically garbage especially defensive rating  I mean Nerlens Noel is currently 3rd and Montezl Harrell (a notoriously bad defender) is top 10 and people like Jakob Poetl and Kyle Kuzma are above Ben Simmons
"Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor, for me"
"They‚Äôre fine, they probably should just double down on size and move Ingram and Zion to the 2-3 and just use their size and iso ability to get by. Hopefully they can develop a two man game. I actually think they‚Äôre almost set in Lonzo, Hart, Ingram, Zion. I think they just need a 5 who stretches and defends like miles turner. Or maybe Nerlens Noel would work because he defends at such a high level and can run the floor in transition. They have Jackson Hayes, I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs already yet though. Regardless they‚Äôre a 5 who fits away. Why they didn‚Äôt traded for horford is beyond me."
Knicks. I‚Äôm a diehard 76ers fan but I always like to root for teams closest to my area. And Nerlens Noel has a special place in my heart as a former 76er and since both my parents went to Kentucky.
"That $25 million a year was reported by Ryan Mcdonough, who I don‚Äôt know is trustworthy. He was known for playing games in the media when he was a Suns exec.      The Rockets extension was only 2 years.       I don‚Äôt think we know for sure what Oladipo wants. I don‚Äôt think this is a Nerlens Noel situation yet."
Nerlens Noel type beat
"It's been kindof interesting whose teams fans were feeling insecure or just wanting to prove their centers were better over the years, because their teams fans are always commenting negatively about Jokic. Funnily enough it started with Philly with Okafor and Nerlens Noel, moved on to Portland and MN with Nurkic and KAT... Portland fans were particularly bad as we traded Nurkic to them. Then last year Laker fans and Philly fans. Now its just Philly. (obviously Nuggets fans are probably also commenting in the reverse, but its just interesting how fan comments have died off from different groups as Jokic has ascended)"
He's starting because Mitch is out but Nerlens Noel is Top 5 in blocks this year and he's coming off our bench
i would like ayton for taj gibson and nerlens noel  what do you mean the suns have rejected my offer  *turns 'force trade' on*
"Don't really think the Holiday trade is a problem...we shipped him out once we knew we could get Noel who many thought was the #1 pick, and also got a future first (traded for Saric). Very defensible trade.  Hinkie's drafting is really quite strong thought tbh, he was just in an awful bind a couple of times  MCW at 11 (bargain) which he sold high on  Nerlens at 6  Jerami Grant at 39  Embiid at 3  Saric at 12  Reportedly (unconfirmed) wanted Porzingis at 4 but was squashed by ownership and Porzingis' management. Okafor obviously sucked but go look at that draft and tell me the correct selection at 3.  Willy Hernangomez at 35  Holmes at 37  Not to mention the undrafted guys he signed"
"It helps greatly that the Thunder have begun their rebuild with one piece reasonably in place, with SGA.  And Lu Dort seems like he's been a positive contributor.  So it seems like there is actual progress being made with the Thunder. And the early returns on Josh Giddey have been positive too.  On the other hand, the Sixers top pick in 2013 didn't play that year.  Then in 2014, the Sixers two lottery picks didn't play, and the Sixers traded away their other 2013 lottery pick-who actually won rookie of the year- for a future draft pick (that wouldn't be realized until 2018).  So two years after The Process began and 4 lottery picks later, there was one year of Nerlens Noel and that was it.  And then the year after that, they went 10-72!  And on top of that, they drafted another center who got into a physical altercation with fans of an opposing team during the year.  What really saved the Process was after sitting for two years, Embiid was even better than advertised.  But if Embiid would have come back and just been iffy or not been able to come back at all, the Process would be the most ridiculed strategy since the Cavs of the Stepien era of the 80s  I was a supporter of the Process then and still am reasonably for it now.  But the two situations are not the same in the least."
Thank you! And when Nerlens Noel did that tough guy shoulder bump to Trae walking off the court
"Christian Wood played for 3 teams after us/before Detroit, and didn‚Äôt get minutes there either. Jerami Grant actually did get minutes on our team but was extremely young, didn‚Äôt play well on OKC until his 3rd season there.   Nerlens Noel got minutes, but we had Jahlil and Joel who were all fighting for minutes at C. that‚Äôs on the front office, not Brett.   just admit you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about b"
The sixers also had:  Jerami Grant  Richaun Holmes  Christian Wood  Alex Caruso  Robert Covington  Nerlens Noel
"I would say from the mosaic formed by the Nerlens Noel situation, the claiming that the next team will pay him back (untrue), and haphazard strategy retreats (trying to involve Maxey, for instance), that yes, Rich Paul is a clown who used to sell fake jerseys and is only good at negotiating top 10 players, if at all."
"100, they need one more back up defensive big imo. Maybe like a nerlens noel? Aomeone to come in spot minutes and be a rebounding, shot blocker"
"Oh yeah, there's not a chance in hell that Nerlens Noel gets anywhere near $60-70m from this lawsuit unless there is a legitimately black and white contract written up somewhere that someone can prove wasn't shown to Noel. But like I said, it'll all come out eventually, you're wasting your breath in /r/nba where people want to just meme and pile on players/teams/agents they don't like. Just look at how many Ben Simmons topics get pulled up to the top even if they say like tiny different variations of the same info."
"I‚Äôm not a rich Paul fan lmao nor even particularly a Lebron fan (other than that he currently plays for my favorite team).   I think there‚Äôs a lot that‚Äôs been exaggerated with reporting on this lawsuit and especially uniformed Redditors commenting on the suit.   First of all, this should never have been brought because the arbitration clause that Noel signed binds both parties. Noel‚Äôs lawyer knows this but they filed in in court it for PR reasons. And It worked because people hate Rich Paul and will assume the worst.   Second, the headline claim for $60-70m related to turning down the Dallas offer is a Hail Mary. Agents aren‚Äôt liable for clients following advice that turned out  to be bad only in hindsight. The fact that Noel got injured right after turning down the long contract will be extremely hard to overcome.   Third, there is a plausible claim for breach of fiduciary duty and potential damages IF Noel can prove that Rich Paul violated or breached an actual duty and it led to Noel missing out on $x amount minus the league minimum deals he eventually signed for.   This last claim may depend on exactly what it is that Rich Paul failed to do. There is a big difference between merely not returning phone calls from interested teams versus not returning calls regarding concrete offers. An arbitrator would need to find it with substantial certainty that had Rich Paul picked up the phone, other teams would‚Äôve offered a higher contract and that Noel would have taken whatever deal at specific team.   This last claim even if Noel wins probably won‚Äôt be a big amount because the market for Nerlens Noel, a backup defensive first center isn‚Äôt that hot in the modern nba. We‚Äôre talking around $5m (the amount that Noel ultimately received from the Knicks) minus $2.5m for vet minimum. This is a far cry from the $60-70m that everyone is citing to."
Lmao how would Nerlens Noel‚Äôs former agent have any personal knowledge about whether other teams supposedly offered any concrete offers to Nerlens Noel or even expressed interest when he no longer was representing Nerlens Noel?  Do people even think critically anymore?
"http://sportsagentblog.com/2021/10/25/rich-paul-wants-nerlens-noel-case-pushed-to-private-arbitration/  Article with a link to the motion to dismiss pdf along with some extra comments. Article points out that NBPA senior counsel agrees with the motion and the article author postulates that this might be a quick decision, and that this might be the last public document we see on the case.  I'm guessing from perusing the original complaint that Noel saw in arbitration (the dispute was already in arbitration when he filed suit) that because the agent contract says that he has to go to arbitration in 30 days after knowing about any issue which he obviously didn't (whether or not the allegations are correct), the filing suit in court was a desperate attempt to try and get around that and smear Paul if it failed."
It's crazy that all of this is because the team and his agent are beefing with one another over something that happened with Nerlens Noel years ago. I do think some of it had to do with him choking in the playoffs and the fans souring on him but not nearly as much as Paul and Klutch vs 76ers. Crazy this is over some other shitty player.
"https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/08/25/report-rich-paul-klutch-filed-grievance-with-union-over-nerlens-noel-commission/  &gt;However, the filing makes no mention of a commission on the New York contract. In fact, the lawsuit claims ‚ÄúPaul played virtually no role‚Äù in the Knicks deal."
"Much like how your franchise ran off Jimmy Butler, Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel, Markelle Fultz, and tried to pull a Dennis Schr√∂der on the league by drastically inflating the trade price for Ben Simmons, only to get nothing."
The same thing happened with Nerlens Noel in Dallas when they didn't give him the bigger offer he was looking for. That was the year he was so checked out he went and got himself hot dogs in the middle of a game.
"lmfao okay when Nerlens Noel averages double digit points per game, let alone 20+ ppg, then you can say that."
"Considering you still got people talking about him, I don't see him rated properly yet. He should be less popular than Nerlens Noel."
"I mean, I agree. Between the Lakers taking on what feels like 80% of Klutch Sports clients and the Ben Simmons deal, and the Nerlens Noel situation I'm sick of him and Klutch."
"Not true. The trade gave us the ability to sign randle who was all nba. Also gave us the ability to sign Marcus Morris who we traded for the pick that got us IQ. Quickly was big for us last season and might be our second most valuable young asset.    KP when healthy doesn't exist anymore. Hasn't for years. And KPs playoff ejection was him being rooked by Marcus Morris (a player that would be great next to Luka, and could have been acquired if not for the trade).    And Luka made it that far DESPITE the trade. Not because of it. If the mavs had Luka, curry, Harrison Barnes, Morris , and nerlens noel they would be a better team imo. And all of those are players they let walk away(except Morris who they could have signed)"
Which bags have they messed up? Allegedly Nerlens Noel? They have a far better track record and it‚Äôs why the game‚Äôs top athletes are signing with them lmao
"The sub is filled with people who thought we‚Äôre gonna tear up the league with Nerlens Noel and Sterling Brown, Kidd gonna awaken KP‚Äôs hidden potential (like he‚Äôs Gohan) and photos of Luka not looking fat from one angle and the sub thinking he‚Äôs gonna go prime mj mode on the league"
"Well, you guys had Jrue, but they decided to trade him for Nerlens Noel and a 1st rounder (Dario Saric) üòÖ"
"Starting with The Process in 2013, pretty much all the Sixers top picks were crazy in one way or another for about 6 straight years. Embiid was the most successful, but he missed his first two years with injuries and has missed 131 games in the years since. Simmons was the second most successful pick and we all know what's going on with him. Then they had Nerlens Noel with the 6th pick, Jahlil Okator with the 3rd pick, Fultz with the 1st pick, the Bridges/Smith swap with the 10th pick and Michael Carter-Williams with the 11th pick. Definitely no shortage of drama with any of them."
"It was definitely more than just 3 years.    2013: Nerlens Noel - Injured, Missed Rookie year  2014: Joel Embiid - Injured, Missed first two seasons  2015: Jahlil Okafor - Not Injured, Mega bust  2016: Ben Simmons - Injured, Missed Rookie year  2017: Markelle Fultz - Injured, Missed 68 games in Rookie year  2018: Zhaire Smith - Injured/Near death allergic reaction, Missed 76 games in Rookie year and only played 13 total career games"
"I don't think Rich cares that much about Ben, to be honest  I pointed it out in another comment  If you see how he fucked over CAA without telling them and how Bron then ran over to Endeavor before UTA, and take the Nerlens Noel stuff into account   Your worth at Klutch seems to be based on your monetary value.  Or at least, whatever space you occupy in Paul's head seems to be allocated that way"
"I don't disagree, but I do think you're wrong about people not thinking Rich is a moron  That is very much the prevailing sentiment on this sub.  I know that's surface level and r/nba's favorite thing is to make fun of r/nba but yeah.  Dude's here think Rich has the intellect of a weed carrier.    I think what's much more telling is how his relationships with CAA went sour.  He left, pulled a Sonny at toll booth without telling his mentors, took Bron, teamed up with their direct competitors and didn't think twice about it  Probably a similar situation with Nerlens Noel.  It seems at Klutch, when you're not a guaranteed commission there isn't a whole lot of labor given to your career."
"&gt; If offered, you gotta take that money. You just have to.  *Dennis Schroder, Nerlens Noel and Victor Oladipo have entered the chat*"
"Gobert is better peak to peak than Russell, I think he would be similar to Nerlens Noel"
Honestly the only 2 realistic guys I'd rather have backing up Embiid are Nerlens Noel and Tony Bradley
Nerlens Noel
"The head of the players' association needs to be fined, as well, since even a 5yr-old knew Philly was waiting and looking and searching for a reason to take dude's money anyway... he been asked to be traded, and once they knew they'd never get fair value after screwing themselves, they went on a hunt to recoup some of that salary.  This is sickening, this is trifling, this is why Rich Paul did the correct thing year's ago when he tried to protect Nerlens Noel from Philly's rogue mgmt.   With these phantom fines and so and so forth, it reminds of the evil that ATL Dream's owner Renee Montgomery recently pulled on Chennedy Carter"
"The Colangelos, all of them, made a mess of that rebuild.  Hinkie got booted before he was finished the ""easy"" part.  Morey is trying to salvage the payoff part.  Jerry and Bryan Colangelo fucked this team.  We've got Bryan to thank for the following: Holding Nerlens Noel until there was nothing left of his trade value (Bogut, Justin Anderson and two 2nds), using a first on Timothe Luwawu Cabarot, signed fucking Jerryd Bayless and Gerald Henderson.  Traded the 3rd overall pick and our first in 2019 to our division rival to move up to first and take the kid that by all accounts the Celtics didn't want and the Lakers already seemingly in on Lonzo.  Traded Jahlil Okafor, *Sauce Castillo* and a second for... Trevor Booker?  Who was unceremoniously cut 2 months later. Granted Okafor had minimal value, but surely there was a better deal than Trevor Booker. Or we'd have been better off holding on to that 2nd rounder at least.  Fucking Burner Gate, the most ridiculous story to happent to the Sixers and surely the most ridiculous story that would ever happen to the Sixers for at least 2-3 years.  And then *THAT* led to the Elton Brand/Brett Brown brain trust which finished screwing the pooch on assets and cap space.  I was all about the process and still think it could have worked, but that's a tough fucking stump to pull."
"Nerlens Noel ain't walking through that door, buddy"
"It really annoyed me trying to look up the history of this the other day.  Because every media outlet keeps attaching conditionals to the ""no one has ever done it"".  But there have been at least three players who've done it - Greg Monroe, Shabazz Muhammed, Nerlens Noel.  All lotto picks too."
Rich 'Fuck Nerlens Noel in Particular' Paul
"I wouldn't call this a ""bad take"" as much as I would just call it a ""magic johnson level"" take. Obviously Philly is going to get worse if they instantly lose an all star caliber player/someone who eats like 25% of their cap space.   &amp;#x200B;  Even in all these mock trades where Philly ""improves"", their defense gets noticeably worse but their offense and spacing gets better. It is really impossible to even consider Philly getting better without seeing the return. Whoever is saying they ""magically get better"" by cutting off Ben isn't really worth talking to or responding to?   &amp;#x200B;  I think that explains the responses your getting. Its like if I said ""look guys, I just dont think Nerlens Noel instantly becomes an MVP candidate by adding a 3pt shot."" What else can you respond with other than ""yeah no shit"". Like can you elaborate on what the problem is at least?"
you just get a guy like dwight powell or nerlens noel and then play small ball with saric at center
We offered Nerlens Noel 17.5M per year **in the hope** that he starts averaging 14 and 11 (his best season was 11 and 8).  Doubling that for someone that *has already done at least that* in multiple seasons isn't a stretch of the imagination.
"Because the only time someone's actually taken the QO (Nerlens Noel, Shabazz Muhammed) they basically got no offers in UFA."
"No NBA player that can get a lot more otherwise is taking the QO. You only do that if you think you can get significantly more on the open market next year ... and it has to be really big.  Look at Nerlens Noel. He rejected a $70 mil/4 years offer ($17.5 mil average) and took a QO instead ($4 mil). For that decision to have been worth it, he had to have thought he was a $22 mil/year player or higher for 3 years.  In Ayton's case, MPJ got $172M/5years (34.4m average). A QO for Ayton would be $16M. That means for him to take a QO, he would have to think he can get at least $39m/year for 4 years ... which under current cap maxes and rules wouldn't even be possible."
"Yeah I don't understand those saying he's not worth the max.  We offered Nerlens Noel a 4-year $70M deal based on the *hope* that the 11.1PPG/8RPG season he had would become 14PPG/10RPG consistently, at least.  Deandre Ayton have much better numbers for more seasons, even after having ""sacrificed his stats"", so he's already worth the max."
"How many elite dive-and-dunk bigs double as canny passers -- capable of facilitating the offense?   The number who do both at Williams' level is really small.  And how many of those can do this to James Harden in a close playoff game?   That is the promise of the ""Time Lord"" wrapped into one nine-second sequence: switching onto one of the greatest ball handlers ever, maintaining a stance, keeping his arms out, staying balanced against all fakery, and finally rising to reject a 3-pointer from an all-time scorer unaccustomed to such rudeness.  Williams had nine blocks in that game. When asked if he remembers that one, he simply says, ""We lost. I know that."" Teammates and coaches say Williams does not care about scoring or stats -- that he only wants to win. He works hard, and shows up on time now. (Williams concedes the Time Lord nickname will follow him forever. ""It ain't going anywhere, so I accept it,"" he says.)  Williams has great hands. Only two rotation players -- Williams and Nerlens Noel -- averaged more than 1.5 steals and three blocks per 36 minutes last season, according to Basketball-Reference. The Celtics have tried everything from switching to blitzing with Williams, and he has looked at home doing all of it.  ""He has natural ability on defense that not a lot of young bigs have,"" says Al Horford, a teammate both now and during Williams' rookie season. ""From our very first pickup game, that stood out.""  The raw materials of a special two-way center are here. That's why the Celtics' front office frantically canvassed sources in the middle of the 2018 draft, trying to figure out why Williams was slipping -- whether there was some medical issue -- and if they should trade up to get him, sources say.  The issue has been consistency. Williams has played only 113 games in three seasons, due mostly to nagging injuries. As Sam Vecenie has pointed out on the Game Theory podcast, Williams has logged 30 or more minutes in exactly one game.  On defense, his fundamentals come and go. Williams sometimes stands up instead of holding his crouch, and droops his arms to his sides. ""I have to improve my stance -- my posture,"" he says. He can't resist some pump fakes. ""That's hard, trust me,"" he says, laughing.  He can rotate late, and chase blocks he has no chance at -- leaving the glass naked. He sometimes swings his arms down instead of staying vertical. Boston coaches have been on him to keep blocks inbounds instead of swatting them into the stands. Back-to-basket behemoths -- a dwindling group -- can shove him backward.  As a rookie defending pick-and-rolls, Williams often abandoned ball handlers too early to get back to his man -- conceding easy drives. Now, he sometimes overcompensates by lingering too long on the ball, allowing his man to skulk behind him for pocket passes:   Mastering that stuff takes years, but Williams is trending the right way. He became more diligent on the glass last season.  Even his passing can go haywire, though it's not always his fault. He sees the game so fast, some of his passes -- especially tip passes on offensive rebounds -- catch teammates off guard.  ""I just gotta slow it down a little sometimes,"" Williams says, ""and stop throwing so many bullets.""  The combined passing between Horford and Williams is the main reason the Celtics -- and the two principles -- are optimistic the double-big pairing can work. Horford can stretch the floor, then pump and drive, and lob to Williams in the dunker spot. Williams can orchestrate while Horford screens in off-ball split actions.  Space will open when Boston goes smaller, with only one of the Williams-Horford tandem. Williams is a cagey hand-off guy, outthinking defenses by flipping the direction of his screens and signaling his shooters to flare away for corner jumpers. He is starting to eat up the space defenses give him with hard dribbles leading into soft-touch paint shots:   He slips hard out of picks, and knows all the reads before he catches the ball: dunker spot, corner shooters, wing shooters.  The Celtics expect Williams to shoot more jumpers at some point. Posting up guards on switches will be one of the final frontiers -- something Williams hasn't done much, even as several teams, including the Brooklyn Nets in the playoffs, have switched point guards onto him.  Development is uncertain. Williams might top out as an average center; the Celtics paid him as such in his recent contract extension.  But the upside is so much higher -- like All-Star high -- and if Williams stays healthy, he's a good bet to unlock at least some of it"
"&gt;I don't foresee any rookie (edit: rookie contract guy) ever doing that   Nerlens Noel already did, that's why he fired his previous agent (who was recommending that he accept the Mavs offer)"
"It is unless you are being intentionally difficult. Most people would say that the natural defensive position of Nerlens Noel and Richaun Holmes is the 5. And yet the can‚Äôt defend Embiid effectively. Therefore it is not necessary to be able to defend Embiid effectively for you to be able to defend the 5 in general. Therefore it is reasonable to say Lebron in his prime could defend the 5, even though he could not effectively defend Embiid."
"‚ÄòNerlens Noel can‚Äôt guard Embiid so that proves LeBron can guard 5s‚Äô  Again, that‚Äôs not a rational argument"
Can Nerlens Noel guard Embiid? Richaun Holmes? I‚Äôm just saying that not being able to guard Embiid doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt guard most other centers in the league. Embiid and Jokic are pretty much the only dominant physical post players in the whole league
The guy saying Ainge Dunn fucked up followed immediately by a reply implying Ainge was stupid for not trading the #3 for Nerlens Noel and two late firsts is like peak comedy.  Those Process players got hyped up so much and everyone except Embiid washed out.
"Using some of our current players, it would be something along the lines of:   Luka/ Goran Dragic  Tim Hardaway Jr./ Reggie Bullock/ Danny Green  Mikal Bridges/ Dorian Finney-Smith/ PJ Tucker  Robert Covington/ Maxi Kleber  Myles Turner/ Nerlens Noel   The 2011 team had a ton of excellent defenders and vets on it, this team is still much younger than the 2011 team though lol"
The other baskets also include Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor.  I know they don't get those high lottery if these 2 panned out but how do you draft top 6 five years in a row and get 1 franchise guy + whatever Ben is gonna do
Oladipo because he bet on himself and lost out worse than nerlens Noel. Atleast kyrie has a ring and all he has to do is take a shot and he's back like nothing happened
"The problem is, if this was the first time something like this happened more people would let it go but since that report came out about Nerlens Noel and the lawsuit attached to it it's now a repeat offense on Rich Pauls end of things on letting money walk out the door due to negligence and makes the Noel lawsuit stronger."
"Rich Paul is an absolute trash manager. imagine losing 80 mil because your ""agent"" didn't return calls to GMs.   They put up a big adversarial front but at the end of the day I think this Simmons fiasco and the Nerlens Noel lawsuit will kill their rep. Terrible handling of both situations."
"Dwight, Drummond, Whiteside, Lamar us Aldridge, Nerlens Noel, whichever Celtics one you want to pick, more and more names come to my mind  Edit: Kanter, zubac, literally multiple guys on the magic, whichever cavs guy you want to pic"
If you read about the Nerlens Noel situation it‚Äôs pretty clear that Klutch is a terrible agency
Why is that? Noel taught he could get more than $100 million. Should‚Äôve known his worth. Rich Paul has like a quarter of the league as his clients I doubt Nerlens Noel of all people is going to bring down his reputation.
"So far. He overplayed his hand with AD and the pelicans and then it turned out ok.  If Simmons gets traded in Dec, Rich Paul might come out reasonably well.  I suspect Nerlens Noel might wind up doing as much or more damage to rich paul than Simmons."
i have been saying this since that nerlens noel and kcp contract renewal disasters him turning down contract offers then getting pennies. man is as smooth as  old asphalt when it come to negotiating contracts of non-star player guys.
"Paul doesn't seem to care about other people's money. Nerlens Noel is suing him for costing him something like $35m?  Paul will be a nothing once LeBron retires and all of his ""power"" goes bye-bye."
Probably the same game he was playing with Nerlens Noel.
"https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/  Lets see, we got ...   Danny Green Jae Crowder Tristan Thompson Reggie Jackson Nerlens Noel"
"Who was this rumored about?   You are thinking of Nerlens Noel, who is on the Knicks."
a wild Nerlens Noel appears
"Wrong --   Jimmer:  Thought he was a future NBA MVP.  Turned out being a CBA MVP, so I wasn't too far off.  Just one letter.    Thought Nerlens Noel and Okafor were going to be amazing together...like Robinson and Duncan or something.    I thought something similar to Kyle Korver's career was Booker's absolute ceiling.  I thought MKG and James Young were perennial all stars, and they aren't even perennial players.    Embiid:  Watched him in college and he was just obviously so new to the game.  It didn't make sense to me why so many people were so high on him.  Wiggins:  Thought he was drastically better than Embiid at Kansas.  He's still a good player, just obviously a wrong take.    AD:  Expected him to be good, but really thought he wasn't going to be anywhere near as good as John Wall or Demarcus Cousins.      Right (not many) --  Draymond:  I couldn't comprehend how he ended up as a second round pick.  Seemed like an obvious perennial all star the way he owned the court at Michigan State.    Bennett:  I couldn't comprehend how anyone looked at this dude and thought he had a higher ceiling than role player."
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.  Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, K√©vin S√©raphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."
So this was all a giant Klutch sports PR stunt to distract from the seemingly very legitimate Nerlens Noel lawsuit??
Also the Nerlens situation which is much worse. At worst this is embarrassing for Ben. Noel got millions lost because of Rich's incompetence.
Isnt Rich Paul the one that Nerlens Noel is suing because he advised him to not sign an extension and enter free agency?
I remember years ago a dude said Jokic could end up being a better player than Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor and got shit on for it.
"DRose, Julius Randle and Nerlens Noel are all currently injured and Kemba Walker and Mitchell Robinson have played an average of 48 games the last two years.   Barrett and Quickly were very reliable last year, but Topin and Knox were not. I don‚Äôt trust the rookies or Fournier, but maybe you do."
Don't bring up Nerlens Noel around Clippers fans
"Honestly, Gobert is underrated. He‚Äôs a top 5 defense onto himself and I think it really goes under the radar how bad his defensive supporting cast is in Utah. If you told me a team with Conley-Mitchell-O‚ÄôNeale-Bogdanovic-Nerlens Noel was a bottom 10 defense, would it be that surprising?"
"Philly ousted Sam Hinkie because they didn't trust the process. They replaced him with Bryan Coangelo who was a nepotistic hire by Jerry Colangelo. When Hinkie left, the Sixers had the following assets on their books:  ASSETS:  * Joel Embiid  * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons)   * Jerami Grant   * Christian Wood   * Richaun Holmes   * Robert Covington   * Dario Saric   * Nerlens Noel   * Jahlil Okafor   * 2016 Miami 1st round pick   * 2016 OKC 1st round pick   * Kings future 1st round pick   * Pick swap with the Kings   * Tons of 2nd round picks   ____  While hindsight is 20:20, it is undeniable that most of these assets were ultimately wasted. Brett Brown and the Colangelos completely wasted Philadelphia's window of contention by creating a culture which caused Jimmy Butler to want out. Shortly after picking Brown over Butler, they fired Brown and replaced him with Doc Rivers. After yet another 3-1 loss, Rivers threw Simmons under the bus in an interview which ignited the situation you are dealing with now.  There is no argument here, I just wrote that to be diplomatic. The Sixers FO has been terrible."
  PG: James Harden   SG: Norman Powell  SF: Royce O‚ÄôNeal    PF: John Collins  C: Nerlens Noel
"Fair point about AD, I wasn't just basing it on Simmons though. Nerlens Noel sued Paul (though we don't know how much of it is true yet) and other players were cited in his lawsuit on how Paul messed up their careers.   He played hardball with the Cavs regarding Tristan Thompson's contract but it took LeBron publicly speaking out to get him the big contract.  Maybe I should re-phrase it, I'm not saying he's the worst agent or terrible but I don't think he's the best in the business."
Unless the player is below max and he doesn‚Äôt give a shit about them (Nerlens Noel &amp; KCP)
Nerlens Noel licking his lips right now.
"guys like capela, dwight, nerlens noel"
&gt; hopefully it at least takes Rich Paul down with him.  As if the Nerlens Noel clown show didn't already?
Didn‚Äôt get Nerlens Noel signed
"Where would he be without his connection to LeBron? There‚Äôs no evidence that he‚Äôs good at his job when it doesn‚Äôt involve helping out a team or friend of Lebron‚Äôs. See Tristan Thompson, KCP and Anthony Davis. See Ben Simmons and Nerlens Noel, even his client Zach lavine is unhappy with his pay. Rich Paul has only been able to use the ‚Äúpay my guy or lebron might leave‚Äù move"
"yes and no.  he cost that player, nerlens noel, an unknown amount of money by not passing on the other teams' interest, probably not ""a lot"" though or paul would have cared more about getting something done for him.  but he cost noel a _lot_ of money by convincing noel to fire his then-agent and hire paul instead because paul convinced noel that noel could get more money than an already very large contract he was offered if he turned that contract down, which wound up not happening (injury issues, or just underperforming?  not sure).  i think noel's case for the first thing is stronger than the second thing, though."
"Where would he be without his connection to LeBron? There‚Äôs no evidence that he‚Äôs good at his job when it doesn‚Äôt involve helping out a team or friend of Lebron‚Äôs. See Tristan Thompson, KCP and Anthony Davis. See Ben Simmons and Nerlens Noel"
"Rich Paul, more like Poor Paul amirite? Losing all this money for his clients. I hope Nerlens Noel wins his case against Klutch Sports."
Name 1 contract a player got because of Rich Paul.  A bunch of max dudes who were getting the max anyway.  And a bunch of middling guys who got paid because LeBron wanted them on his team.  Anybody NOT in those categories (NErlens Noel?) gets fucking ignored.
Ask Nerlens Noel. He's working on that
AT LEAST three of them.  Nerlens Noel and 2 others.  Brain not giving me the names right now though.
&gt;I‚Äôd want him representing me no doubt  Top ten signs you aren‚Äôt Nerlens Noel
Adele is apparently jealous of Nerlens Noel given how much Rich Paul fucked him
"Ayton is not Nerlens Noel though, he's proven to be a fantastic player on both ends and he's only 22. The Mavs offered Nerlens a contract while Cuban was on a coke bender and he still turned it down  Ayton knows that he's getting maxed next summer barring freak accidents or regressions"
Didn‚Äôt Nerlens Noel take the QO from Dallas?
"I guess it's just a coincidence that this keeps happy with Rich Paul clients? I guess we can just ignore the whole Nerlens Noel thing? No one said this was Rich strong-arming anyone, just that he is going about this in a way most agents would not."
Tell that to Nerlens Noel
Yeah people have to look at the assets he left them with:  * Joel Embiid - C * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons) - PF/PG * Jerami Grant  - PF * Christian Wood - PF/C * Richaun Holmes - C * Robert Covington - PF * Dario Saric - PF/C * Nerlens Noel - C * Jahlil Okafor- C  Do people seriously think Hinkie was getting full return on what was the single greatest PF/C logjam in NBA history?  Do people seriously think Hinkie would have saved the 76ers from Colangelo/Brand overinvesting in PFs and Cs?  They had to sell guys at a loss because they had no place for **NINE** +6'10 guys who couldn't shoot.
"**PG:** Ben Simmons   **SG:**  **SF:** Robert Covington  **PF:** Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Dario Saric   **C:** Joel Embiid, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor  For argument's sake, imagine they use the OKC and Miami picks to draft even Caris LeVert and Malik Beasley.   That gives them a starting lineup of Simmons, LeVert, Covington, Grant, Embiid. You only really need to keep one of Wood/Saric and one of Holmes/Noel/Okafor then.   The next part which would have made things *really* interesting is if they take Tatum instead of Fultz in 2017. That gives them a rotation of:   Simmons, LeVert, Tatum, Grant, Embiid with a bench including Beasley, Covington, Wood/Saric and Holmes/Noel.   Then who knows what you could get in a trade with the other one of Wood/Saric, Holmes/Noel/Okafor and all their future picks."
"Your argument is entirely built on the false premise that his picks were consensus picks that every other GM would have made. You don't know that because you don't know what other teams draft boards looked like. Which are the consensus picks you claim he made? What makes KJ McDaniels, Nerlens Noel, MCW, Elfrid Payton consensus picks?  That's the flawed logic your argument is built on and the person replied that even if that was the case he should be drafting on what he thinks will bring the most value to his team not what the ringers mock draft say...case in point Ainge trading the first pick to take Tatum"
"&gt;just look at that insane collection of assets  Adding guys like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel etc is pretty disingenuous since those players realized their full value post hinkie and post sixers.  The criticism I've heard is he did not do anything another person couldn't do...basically saying if the goal is to accumulate assets by being as bad as possible then anyone can do that. Personally I don't think his tenure as GM should be viewed through black and white, good/bad lenses. He did well in some parts (won most of the trades he made) and did poorly in others (failed to build a good team culture, did terribly at the social aspects of the job, mediocre draft record)"
"You‚Äôve got to go back the year before you started the post. Trading to get Nerlens Noel at the draft in 2013. It should have been a sackable offence to draft three near 7ft Cs in three consecutive drafts. Noel, Embiid and Okafor. Terrible drafting."
Didn't they also draft Nerlens Noel ?   You also missing another wasted lottery pick I think the Embid year?
Turned down those offers multiple times. Nerlens Noel also only earned 27 million his whole career. By far the dumbest career flop ever. 30 million career but had 70 million dollar contracts offered multiple times.
"I think a lot of people are overlooking that Paul was having Noel play on the QO in hopes of securing a max contract the following year. If Nerlens was on board with that plan and these teams are calling him with offers less than the max, why would his agent bring those offers to him?"
"Complete speculation, and a future storyline for a series like Ballers but NBA:    LeBron wanted Noel on the Lakers for as cheap as possible. So, Paul ignored team‚Äôs calls, but the Knicks had direct contact with Noel seeing as they were his current team, and so he was aware of their interest first-hand? Paul begrudgingly negotiated and finalized the contract, having no other option.   Or perhaps Nerlens going to Philly makes them a stronger title contender‚Ä¶so it better serves James‚Äô championship aspirations for the Eastern Conference‚Äôs regular season #1 seed to not grab Nerlens."
"Idk that there was an ‚Äúoffer‚Äù from the 76ers, they allegedly tried to engage Paul in contract talks for Noel, but they never got off the ground because Paul allegedly didn‚Äôt pick up the phone. This was on the heels of Noel following Paul‚Äôs advice to turn down a 4/$70M extension from Dallas the previous off-season. I believe the $58M represents the difference between what Noel was offered by Dallas (4/$70M) and what he actually made the past 4 years (~$10.8M according to [spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/new-york-knicks/nerlens-noel-13319/) contract info), probably less fees and stuff cause the math isn‚Äôt quite right."
"Yeah, helping all players other than.... Nerlens Noel and several other clients. Gtfo of here"
"Teams and rival agents smell blood and they are definitely salivating at the prospects of damaging Klutch‚Äôs influence and power in the league.   Here‚Äôs a much needed reminder not to take ‚Äúaccording to league sources‚Äù as the Gospel.   ‚ÄúIt was around this time, in and around the end of June 2019, that rumors were circulating in NBA circles that Noel was set to sign a three-year deal with the Thunder. Veteran NBA reporter Adrian Wojnarowski even tweeted as much on June 30, 2019. On information and belief, these rumors ‚Äî which turned out to be false ‚Äî were circulated by either Paul, someone from Klutch Sports, or someone within the Oklahoma City organization. As a result of the rumors, on information and belief, teams began shying away from putting offers together to try and sign Noel.‚Äù  Source: http://sportsagentblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nerlens-Noel-v-Rich-Paul.pdf  The above are allegations from Noel‚Äôs complaint claiming that Klutch Sports circulated fake rumors about a three year deal from OKC hoping to create a bidding war for Noel, but they claim that such a tactic actually backfired by scaring teams away.   When private or internal team strategy or intel is leaked to the media, always ask who could stand to benefit from such leaks?  Agents and teams routinely leak or even intentionally make up rumors to the media to suit their own interests.   So now that a lawsuit against Klutch is announced publicly, teams know that they now have the opportunity to beat Klutch in the court of public opinion. They don‚Äôt even need to give sworn depositions or testimony.   All they have to do is leak to the media that they had strong interest in a player who had just come off of a 14 mpg season averaging 4.9 ppg, 4.2 rpg and 0.6 apg and who ended up signing for the league minimum in 2019."
"Oh yeah I can definitely see Brett trying to get Nerlens but the only issue is, he was the GM for only one offseason and that was in 2018. If we were trying to get Noel in 2019, why didn‚Äôt it say Elton Brand or any other member of that GM roundtable we had? Plus if you remember Brett was about to fired before we went 7 games with Toronto so I truly can‚Äôt see him having great power during that time.  I‚Äôll give them some leeway and say maybe Brett really wanted Noel and the FO was willing to make it work due to needing a backup center in the 2019 offseason (which led to the KOQ signing I believe) but in no way shape or form was it Noel or Horford. That‚Äôs someone in our old FO trying to make excuses."
"Welcome to the real world there are pitfalls for some agents. Some agents might give you their service to Lebron James or Ben Simmons, because they are lucrative stars. In the case of Nerlens Noel he became not a lucrative asset where in Klutch Sport perspective they had to work twice as hard to get profits. Rich Paul worked hard in beginning, but he build enough hype with Lebron help to choose who to work hard for. I hope these young NBA players learn in the end it is business to make profits, read, and understand the steps."
Re-reading the original article this paragraph is right before the BB one:  &gt;Paul is criticized for failing to make an effort to try to secure contracts or deals on Noel‚Äôs behalf during the 2018-19 NBA season he spent with the Thunder **and thereafter. Noel declined a player option on the second year of his deal with the Thunder and instead hit the free agent market. He received no offers from any other teams and was forced to sign another one-year league minimum contract with the Thunder.**  So maybe Brett tried two years in a row to get Nerlens? Nerlens went through two summers of not having Paul do anything for him?  Something doesn't quite add up.
lol do y'all actually think nerlens noel on a contender is what's stopping the lakers from winning a title? this sub is too much sometimes
&gt; they have a suitable proxy war in Nerlens Noel  The Vietnam of the NBA.
"&gt;Noel goes on to allege that the Clippers and Rockets also attempted to contact Paul that same offseason, also to no avail. League sources confirmed this detail to Bleacher Report as well. ""Nerlens was always somebody we really liked in Houston, and definitely tried to get in touch with,"" said one former Rockets official. ""But my understanding is it never got very far.""  If ""it never got very far"" means that they expressed interest and Paul never got back to the Rockets and never told Noel, that's terrible and Noel might have a case.  If ""it never got very far"" means the Rockets made a preliminary offer or broadly described their offer, Noel had previously stated that he wouldn't take that kind of offer, and Paul rejected their offer out of hand and never made a counteroffer--that's going to be a very difficult case for Noel.   Lawyers are required to tell their clients about settlement offers from opposing counsel--unless the client has previously stated that such an offer is unacceptable. I don't know how the ethics rules work for agents, but I imagine it's similar."
"You have to remember there are vested interests in this situation.  FOs have been complaining about Rich Paul's influence over their players and now they have a suitable proxy war in Nerlens Noel. FOs trying to fight 'player empowerment' would have made FOs very unpopular with players, but now they can say they're working on behalf of a player and go after Paul with impunity.   Not a surprise they're jumping in on this drama."
"&gt; the day Klutch Sports dies will be a great day for the NBA  That seems very dramatic.   &gt;how most if not all of his moves as an agent can be traced back to benefitting LeBron or LeBron's team,  Because Draymond, Gary Trent Jr, John Wall or hell even Nerlens Noel have benefited Lebron so much.   I'm not trying to defend Rich Paul here, but you're being very dramatic."
"At the very least, I hope this allows Nerlens to not pay Paul/Klutch that $200k they‚Äôre seeking. Settling all claims and agreeing to part ways seems like a fair outcome here‚Ä¶Nerlens didn‚Äôt file this suit until Paul came after him for that %, so it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs just trying to shake Paul/Klutch down.    Losing out on the $58M is largely on Noel, but it‚Äôs definitely partly on Paul too. It seems fair that Paul loses out on that $200k as penalty for poor management/breach of fiduciary duty."
"There was an article last year (October 2020) that surveyed agents across the NBA anonymously, and one highlighted all this stuff a while back and went into some detail. [Here](https://theathletic.com/2143454/2020/10/22/nba-agent-survey-part-two-lebron-james-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-best-player/?amp) is the source, but because it's behind a paywall I've copied the relevant part.  &gt; ‚ÄúThe worst thing that LeBron is doing is forcing this power with Rich Paul and what that is, in terms of, he‚Äôs a player, but he has prowess in the media space. His company Spring Hill, that‚Äôs awesome. Doing the movies and all of the projects. That‚Äôs so commendable. I love that. But now that they‚Äôve jumped into the agent game, which the reality is, it‚Äôs illegal for a player, particularly if you‚Äôre in the state of California, to be licensed to represent talent.  &gt; ‚ÄúNow I know it‚Äôs this fa√ßade that it‚Äôs Rich Paul, but it‚Äôs really LeBron who recruits for Rich Paul. So it‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre trying to control AAU at the NBA level. This is my AAU team and they‚Äôve carried that to the highest level. And because of his power and his prowess, people, the young players are seduced by LeBron James in the same way people were seduced by Michael Jordan with David Falk. He went from having Michael Jordan and a few other players, to getting the top players in the NBA, because of the Jordan factor. Rob Pelinka had tremendous success as an independent agent because he had Kobe Bryant and the players idolized him. **So, the fact that LeBron recruits and has empowered Rich Paul, and I get it, on the top guys, but if someone does their research, a lot of these guys have really gotten screwed, a large number of them, by mismanagement.**  &gt; ‚Äú**There‚Äôs at least five or six massive casualties.** Nobody is saying anything and you can even say that the union should take some responsibility because they represent all of the players, not just LeBron James. Because this is anonymous. I hope you have the courage to put this out there, because nobody is talking about this but this is the reality, and if you ask any other agent what I just said, they would all agree.  &gt; ‚Äú**They‚Äôve been able to leverage KCP, two or three years in a row because they have the power and they‚Äôre forcing it down their throat. Nerlens Noel. There are four or five of them that have suffered millions of dollars from mismanagement** but nobody has the courage to support it, because all the media wants access to LeBron. They want access to AD.  &gt; ‚ÄúWhat he‚Äôs done is he‚Äôs taking AAU basketball to the NBA, because he has the ability to do that because these young players idolize him. I‚Äôm starting to hear some rumblings that they might be overloaded. Because you can‚Äôt have this level of expectation for a client and service all of these guys. Ben Simmons. Garland. I know this as an agent, you can‚Äôt service them all at this level. You can seduce them, but you can‚Äôt service them all, at that level with what they say they‚Äôre doing. **Nerlens Noel. Norris Cole. Shabazz Muhammed. They lost $80 million in Detroit. This is real talk.**  &gt; ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only disappointment is LeBron has leveraged his popularity with young players for seducing them for Klutch and it‚Äôs not serving all the players well. But for the players that are suffering, there‚Äôs no repercussions. Nobody is criticizing what they‚Äôre doing. And you have to call out the union. They should be meeting with Rich Paul, saying, ‚ÄòWhat happened here? What happened here? They represent all the players. They all pay the same amount for dues. If Rich Paul were a lawyer, he‚Äôd be disbarred five times. But because LeBron is so powerful, there is no accountability. And that‚Äôs the only bad part with LeBron. Everything else is great. It‚Äôs commendable. It‚Äôs progressive. I love it. The part that he‚Äôs pushed Rich Paul in this position and these na√Øve basketball players, that‚Äôs pretty egregiously irresponsible.‚Äù"
"/thread  The ultimate eye test versus box score. I also love how much more impactful he is in the playoffs, one of the rare non-top 10 players whose game is elevated in a playoff setting.  Some other candidates:  * Bruce Brown and Jeff Green for the Nets last year  * DFS  * Richaun Holmes  * Nerlens Noel"
"I wonder if this is related to Nerlens Noel.  Now that Noel is filed lawsuit against Rich Paul/Klutch, Rich Paul is finally returning Sixer's calls"
Nerlens Noel
The guy a couple days ago who said asked if LeBron should be suspended because of the Rich Paul/Nerlens Noel shit lmaoo
"&gt;I've responded to this exact comment already. That's not how this works. If Noel said ""I'm not going there or that role or at that price"" than he doesn't have shit.  What makes you think nerlens said that?   Nerlens is saying he and Paul had no idea what philly would have offered, because paul ignored their calls.   Even if nerlens said he'd only take $100m+, but paul ignored calls, how would he know they weren't offering $100m+?"
"I had a cookout and randomly Nerlens Noel showed up in a white-on-navy short sleeve polkadot buttonup.  He helped wingman me with some chick that was there, but also ate all the ribs."
"there was an article that stated Nerlens decided to sue after learning Rich Paul was trying collect $200,000 from noel for some prior shit"
"That is $16 million less and Williams' contract isn't fully guaranteed on top of that (only 48 million is guaranteed, the rest is tied to incentives).   https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2021/08/sources-robert-williams-extension-is-not-fully-guaranteed-includes-multiple-incentives.html  So you're just proving that the 70 million was an overpay.  If Nerlens signed that contract then I wouldn't have had an issue. Players are overpaid all the time. It's the fact that he couldnt see that the contract was an overpay and thought that he should be paid more.  Williams wasn't that dumb and did the smart thing because he isn't under some delusion that a backup big with limited scoring ability is worth $100 million like Noel."
"Hold up, you think Nerlens Noel was the single missing piece that would have ensured the Sixers won the title?"
Yes because we all know that LeBron has made it his life goal to screw over Nerlens Noel‚Ä¶lmao shut up
Yeah noted LeBron stopper Nerlens Noel was a major obstacle for Bron to win another title  Which other player has Klutch represented that got paid substantially less than expected?
"Rich Paul‚Äôs successes have not been because he‚Äôs good at his job. His success has come from the talent of those around him (clients). The same clients that are only with him because of LBJ‚Äôs influence. Read the Nerlens Noel story, then come back and tell me that ‚Äúrich Paul is good at this‚Äù  **PLEASE**  Klutch is going to lose so many clients in the next 4 years, it‚Äôs going to be hilarious   BTW, I love your username"
"If you don‚Äôt think dudes that don‚Äôt live up to potential still don‚Äôt get paid because they‚Äôre a high lottery pick and someone out there thinks the team they were previously on ‚Äújust didn‚Äôt know how to utilize them properly‚Äù, then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.   Seriously, go read the threads where Nerlens Noel turned down 4 years/$70 million because he thought he could get $100 million, even though the one he turned down was a huge overpay based off his production already.  Also, every team thinks their staff is better equipped to get that potential out. They all believe they can get their own Victor Oladipo (pre injury)."
It‚Äôs not far fetched he was protecting LBJ‚Äôs legacy and making sure he has an easier time winning a chip. Shiiieeet Nerlens Noel is easily good enough to be the difference maker on most championship contending teams.
Nerlens Noel needs Stephen A.'s agent.
"That would be funny, every GM in the NBA wants to testify that they tried to sign Nerlens Noel. In retrospect he would become the hottest free agent in history."
"if this is true, then yes that is a huge   but my questions are  1. Would any current team official be willing to openly admit that those calls were actually made? as shitty as Rich Paul appears if this did happen, I can't imagine the 76ers, or any other team, thinking that other agents wouldn't take note that they're airing their dirty laundry. From my understanding teams and agents are notoriusly petty towards each other, why would the 76ers risk pissing off one of the biggest agents in the NBA let alone other agents for Nerlens Noel when they are so close to being serious championship contenders at the moment. 2. if those calls really were made, why would Rich Paul not just say yes? sure, it's not the biggest payday compared to other clients, but if teams are calling it seems like it would be pretty easy work to say yes to whoever calls first and collect that commission then move on to the next piece of business."
"It really makes you wonder why Rich Paul specifically gets so much shit. I mean, how many people here have ever even heard of the agents of Dennis Schroder or Victor Oladipo? Didn't those guys also turn down huge money and lose out? I've never seen people saying they should sue their agents, instead people say that *they*, not their agents, screwed up.   Why is Nerlens Noel suddenly absolved of his part in that decision and it's all on Rich Paul? You'll note that Noel's former agent doesn't say ""Rich Paul passed"" he says *Nerlens* did. And why is it that everyone knows with apparently intimidate detail every deal Rich Paul has been a part of? Is it cause he's black? Is it because he's associated with LeBron? Both? Why is this such a big story around here for so many people? I can't help but feel like there is some extra subtext that everyone here is tiptoing around."
"*‚ÄùPlease don‚Äôt do me like they did Nerlens Noel,* *With a closeup on my frown,* *With a closeup on my frown.‚Äù*  -	Paul Williams, ‚ÄúNumber One‚Äù"
Lol yes nerlens Noel is gonna get Klutch blackballed I‚Äôm sure
Nerlens Noel had to know he wasn't worth 100 million.....Didn't he??
Nerlens Noel had a contract with Klutch Sports. If they failed to satisfy the most basic duty of telling their client what offers they've received they may be found to have violated that contract.
Nerlens Noel and Rich Paul thought he'd get a max contract???  Ari Gold wouldn't even be able to pull that off!   Hahhahahhahhahahahhahahahhahhahahahahhahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahaha
Why are you taking this personally lol? Are you related? And I think Nerlens Noel would agree with me
"My thoughts on the merits of the Nerlens Noel lawsuit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/pb16ta/some\_thoughts\_on\_the\_nerlens\_noel\_suit\_against/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/pb16ta/some_thoughts_on_the_nerlens_noel_suit_against/)  To summarize, I'm not sure this procedurally has legs, and even if it does, the damages as to the Sixers claim are likely to be way less than as to the Mavs claim (which seems weaker on the merits).  Mods didn't let me post it on its own here (and instead said I should leave it as a comment to a post that already had 1k comments), but hope some of you who are interested will take a look."
"Rich Paul is a disgusting human man. This whole ransom shit he has pulled on the NBA is just disgusting. Revoke this guys licence.   The fact that he has run round saying ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm the guy lebron got into the industry. Sign with me. I‚Äôll make you money‚Äù is a joke. Nepotism is just shitty.   Rich definitely owes Noel money. And he probably owes a lot of other guys too. Noel‚Äôs former rep should consider suing too.   Good on Nerlens for waking up and seeing the damage that had been done. Tbh. I won‚Äôt be surprised if a lot of these max guys wake up 20 years down the track and realise the criminal dog had been robbing them of money the whole time, like Tim Duncan‚Äôs employee had been"
Indeed does seem like breach of fiduciary duty. I hope Nerlens Noel gets the whole $58 million.
&gt;It‚Äôs not throwing Rich Paul in jail to say ‚ÄúNerlins Noel has not been proven a liar so far.‚Äù   Going off of Nerlens' word is assuming that Paul is guilty just because Noel's made an accusation.   &gt;nothing he said is factually proven wrong so far.  Nothing he's said has undergone any scrutiny. How can something be proven wrong before anyone puts any effort into determining the truth of it?
Idk if there‚Äôs any kind of ruling that could come down with regards to Noel passing on the Mavs contract. Seems like that‚Äôs just on Nerlens. Bad advice isn‚Äôt exactly illegal as far as I know. You‚Äôre the one who decided to follow it.   But if Rich Paul was ignoring teams???? Yeah that‚Äôs bad. Idk if Nerlens is getting 58 mil but he should get some kind of recuperation if those claims have weight.
"[Nerlens Noel has hired agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports for representation, @BBallInsiders  has learned.](https://twitter.com/MikeAScotto/status/899781544025436160)  Took me 30s"
Nerlens Noel fits lol
Lol this is the most relevant Nerlens Noel has ever been
"Just doing quick math, Rich Paul made about $239,000 just on the commission for Nerlen‚Äôs two shitty deals he barely did any work for. In other words, Rich Paul is making a shit ton of money even when he barely puts in any effort and doesn‚Äôt give two shits about the client.  This dude could just start hiring some recently graduated, less experienced sports agents, pay them a decent salary (idk, $50-75K a year?) and have them do all the leg work for clients like Nerlens Noel so that the client gets his bag, and I‚Äôm sure he would still come out overall making a ton of money, while making his client happy, even when they‚Äôre not necessarily a ‚Äúmarquee‚Äù client.  Rich Paul and his agency sound greedy and lazy as fuck."

"That‚Äôs so dumb too.   Replace Greg Monroe with Noel and the sixers Atleast make it to 7 vs the bucks, and possibly win a ring.  I‚Äôm not sure if it was laziness, incompetence,  or malice but rich screwed nerlens and embiid."
"""Nerlens Noel"" sounds like a drunk guy trying to say New Orleans a couple times before giving up"
Since you claim ‚Äúbut a lot more missed out on big pay days because of this dude‚Äù   Name them besides Nerlens Noel. I‚Äôll wait.
"Yall say everyone rebutting weird talking points here is 'stanning', but you guys are the ones freaking out about Paul, LeBron, Klutch 'Mafia', etc.   People on that thread were directly blaming LeBron for Nerlens Noel being broke, calling Rich Paul a 'venemous snake of a man', etc... the rhetoric used on Reddit about these things is just weird, don't know how else to explain it.   It's like when this sub called LeBron a 'fake black leader' on a post with him walking off the court without shaking the hands."
Lakers flair posting this right after it comes out that Nerlens Noel is suing Rich Paul  Rcih? Is that you?
"&gt; the main facts of the case   Dude, we don't know the facts of the case. Someone making an allegation is not automatically a proven fact. Noel is painting it like he was set to take that money, then Rich Paul suckered him, and then Noel got hurt and Paul ghosted on him, but it's leaving out stuff we know to be true. The hot dog incident is just one thing, as was him getting a bunch of DNP-CDs [because Carlisle didn't think he was working hard enough in practice:](https://sports.yahoo.com/nerlens-noel-totally-wasnt-sending-message-getting-hot-dog-middle-another-dnp-cd-192426120.html)  &gt; ‚ÄúLook, minutes have to be earned,‚Äù Carlisle said after Noel didn‚Äôt play against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Nov. 11. ‚ÄúAt this point, if it‚Äôs between him and Salah, Salah has earned the minutes. There‚Äôs no doghouse here. There just isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs pretty simple: You compete, and if you earn minutes, you get minutes. And you‚Äôve got to compete to keep them, because it‚Äôs a competitive situation.‚Äù  All I'm saying is there is almost surely more to this that is not in Noel's version of things. Sorry I'm not as eager to pick up a pitchfork as you are just on the word of Nerlens Noel."
"You would think being able to say ""I made Nerlens Noel a $100m man"" would be more impressive than getting superstars their standard superstar contracts."
"This is all very one sided, totally ignoring the dumb stuff Noel did which probably cost himself money as well though. Like for instance, when you're in a contract year trying to get $100 million contract, maybe that's not the best time to [ditch your team during the game to go grab a hot dog.](https://www.slamonline.com/archives/nerlens-noel-hot-dog/) This whole account here paints an extremely rosy portrait of Noel but is clearly leaving out anything which could point blame his own direction. Let's wait and see how the lawsuit plays out before just taking Noel's word on this. There's a lot of people out there who are gunning for Rich Paul to fail, whether it's for legit reasons or not."
"In reading the OP's post I think it's important to remember that there are two sides to every story. I see only one side represented here, and I know for a fact they're leaving out some key details. Noel took that Qualifying Offer to try to hit unrestricted free agency the following summer, which is a big time ""bet on yourself"" kind of move. Then it mentions his thumb injury, like that's where it all went bad for him, but it seems to totally leave out the problems Noel created for himself with the Mavs that year. Like for instance, in a year where you're gambling on yourself, is that the best time to [ditch your team at halftime and go grab a hot dog?](https://www.slamonline.com/archives/nerlens-noel-hot-dog/) Is that the kind of thing that's going to increase your market in the off-season?  I'm sure many mistakes were made on Rich Paul's part here, but this thing is presenting it like Noel was just innocently fucked over by Rich Paul for no reason whatsoever. A player's relationship with an agent is two sided, like any relationship. An agent has to sell the player based on what the player does. There's two sides to every story. Let's wait and see how this lawsuit plays out."
"Yikes, Rich Paul screwed up. Something you don't see much often. Hope Nerlens Noel wins the case."
&gt; Also: The Sixers could've contacted Noel directly if they wanted to sign him bad enough.  It sounds like Brown and Nerlens were talking in some capacity.
"Yeah but he owns an agency. I find it weird that at the very least, he wouldn‚Äôt have another agent within Klutch handling these negotiations.  That seems like a no brainer. Delegate the Nerlens Noel contracts of the world to your associates so you can focus on the big dogs. I feel like there is more to this story than Noel‚Äôs accusations."
Don‚Äôt want to Nerlens Noel yourself
Nerlens Noel fits lol
You mean Victor Oladipo? Or you mean Nerlens Noel?
"I think we should maybe push the brakes on comparing Siakam's ability to..lead?..a roster of championship-level complementary starter and rotation pieces to the second round to Randle's ability to lead 32 yo D Rose, Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks, 35 yo Taj Gibson, Reggie Bullocks and 1st and 2nd year players to the playoffs.  No offense meant to Siakam who is a great player and nothing even implied about the Siakam/Randle comparison itself in a more serious context - but this comparison makes absolutely no sense whatsoever."
Not really anymore sadly. Im a wolves fan trust me lol.  He kinda stopped after the nerlens noel incident.
I know my guy. Wiggins is my favorite player.  But after he almost killed nerlens noel he has kinda stopped trying to yam it on people.  He is nowhere near as aggressive as ant or ja even though he could be because he is so God damn athletic.
Nerlens Noel&gt;Randle
Nerlens Noel is out? That‚Äôs big miss
"I cant dig for clips right now, but noel caught a bad elbow from capela against the hawks a month ago and needed 5 stitches.  This is basketball, this happens  https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2021/04/25/nerlens-noels-grit-knows-no-bounds-for-knicks-painful/amp/"
nerlens noel and randle are so fucking shit at basketball they‚Äôre resorting to flopping to get points lol. 30 FT to our 8 yesterday. please watch the game before saying dumb shit on here
"A message to Nerlens Noel, on behalf of the people of Atlanta, and anyone who cares about actually playing basketball the right way, stop hunting for fouls, Nerlens. I want to quote Steve Nash, one of the great players, great coach. He says, ‚Äúthat's not basketball.‚Äù Nerlens ‚Äì Nerlens, that Knicks' not going to fly in Atlanta. Come on, play the game the right way, see if you can win. I think the Hawks are going to teach you a lesson."
"Frankly, Nerlens Noel is ruining basketball. His constant foul hunting is so against the very nature of the sport. Man can't even score when he's not at the free throw line! That's not basketball. As soon as I come up with a good chant about his hair it's over for him."
props to nerlens noel for going 10/12 from the line in a playoff game
Betting on yourself is all well and good until you realize 1 jimmy butler or 1 FVV there's like 10 Nerlens Noel Oladipo
"Knicks were like 29th on the power rankings before the season started . Yeah ppl are upset when their losing games in the playoffs but who the hell would be upset that their team which starts elfrid Payton , Reggie bullock and nerlens noel would be in the playoffs yet alone host a series . Knicks fans are ecstatic about how this season went ."
He ate a [hot dog](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/12/4/16733596/nerlens-noel-hot-dog-mavericks-carlisle-halftime-controversy).
I feel like the Mavs need a defensive minded big. Someone like a Nerlens Noel would help them out significantly.
The real foul baiter is Nerlens Noel.
The fuck you mean ‚Äúhis only help is D Rose?‚Äù D Rose is playing 1 vs 5 and his only help is Nerlens Noel
"Yeah you're right. Refs trying to rig the series by making 65% FT shooter, Nerlens Noel shoot free throws."
Julius Randle had 8 FTAs and Nerlens Noel had 12 FTAs (randle went 8/8 and Noel went 10/12)... the entire team in total had 30 FTAs (making 27 of them)  the Hawks has a TEAM had 8 FTAs...  How did the Knicks lose by 11 points???????
Nerlens Noel is a foul merchant. What i watched tonight was not basketball.
"m‚Äôclassy knicks featuring reggie ‚Äòflagrant‚Äô bullock, Taj ‚ÄòOffensive Tackle‚Äô Gibson and Nerlens ‚ÄòSlewfoot‚Äô Noel can‚Äôt catch a. break against this foul merchant"
"And Nerlens Noel literally has 12 FTA's right now, more than he's ever had in his whole career.  If we won't shoot well from 3 again (we probably will) you definitely won't get this many favorable calls again."
I'm so sick of this soft league and foul baiting. I can't believe all the foul calls for *checks notes* Nerlens Noel???
Nerlens Noel plays like such a bitch
Nerlens Noel hunting for fouls that‚Äôs not basketball
Nerlens Noel getting the shit kicked out of him tonight and the refs are giving him the shots. The Hawks dgaf
Nerlens Noel is my new most hated player
is it racist to say Nerlens Noel looks like Jar Jar Binks
Nerlens Noel isn't doing much for the Knicks on screens. Hawks aren't concerned about him getting the ball at all so the ball handler gets doubled by the off ball guy every time.
"Nerlens Noel was a 70% FT shooter in the reg season, now he is Mark Price"
they call nerlens noel the steph curry of the foul line
Nerlens Noel has not had more than 6 FTA in a game in 5 years. He now has 6 attempts in the first quarter of a game he didn't even start.
"Nerlens ""Anthony Davis"" Noel. Living at the line right now"
nerlens noel fuckin sucks lmao
"Knicks center Nerlens Noel is testing his right ankle prior to Game 3 vs. Hawks and could be limited in minutes after sustaining injury in Game 1, sources tell ESPN. Noel‚Äôs been a defensive anchor for Knicks. Taj Gibson‚Äôs presence may loom larger in series."
We got voodoo shit on our team.   Swat daddy tzantza Nerlens Noel.
Kanter has been absolutely garbage for portland rn against jokic. Nerlens is doing big things for NY. id take Noel any day
But Nerlens Noel can intentionally trip Trae Young and nothing happens. Ok NBA
Nerlens Noel?
"80% of an elite player's production is an average player, like 80% of joe harris 3p% is pretty much league average  80% of nerlens noel might not start in europe"
Nerlens Noel *intentionally trips Trae*  Knicks Fans *spits on Trae*  Knicks Fans ‚ÄúFUCK TRAE YOUNG.

"Imagine if 18 months ago I told you that Julius Randle, Reggie Bullock, Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose, and Alec Burks would lead the Knicks to a playoff win. With help from a wing playing from Dayton and Nerlens Noel."
AY FUCK NERLENS NOEL
"You mean to tell me that trotting out Obi Toppin, Taj Gibson, Immanuel Quickley, and Nerlens Noel will lead to incompetent offense? Damn that's so crazy who could have seen this coming?"
"There‚Äôs such a huge difference in talent and it‚Äôs apparent in the playoffs. Knicks should‚Äôve never been a 4 seed.. the fact that they are is insane . No playoff team starts elfrid Payton , Reggie bullock and Nerlens Noel . They are solid bench pieces ."
"When our subreddit was hyped for our young ""core"" of Dennis Smith Jr, Harrison Barnes and Nerlens Noel"
So you think taken Horton Tucker and Nerlens Noel are better than Ben Simmons? Like what the fuck is this equivalence. I guess it‚Äôs my fault for even engaging with you. This is mega worthless interaction
What in the world?  Sorry man you can‚Äôt talk to me cus you have nerlens Noel Like are you being sarcastic? Or is this the most weirdly stupid comment ever?
"Idk if you‚Äôre joking or not, but I don‚Äôt think Nerlens Noel will be welcome haha. I think his last stint rubbed some people the wrong way. Also, he‚Äôs another player that doesn‚Äôt raise the ceiling.   Best bet, run it back with KP. Unless Turner, Beal, Kawhi, KAT, Lavine etc. inexplicably become available and for some reason a package built around KP/Brunson tops every offer.   Reality; his value isn‚Äôt where it needs to be to get a star right now. But you shouldn‚Äôt trade him for anything. Less than a star. Gotta play it out and hope he bounces back."
Yeah I have no idea who that would be for the Mavs. Maybe Nerlens noel or something. I dunno
The year after he was named an all star we traded him at the draft to get Nerlens Noel in true philadelphia sports fashion üò≠
Add Nerlens Noel going up for a rebound. Man has ping pong paddles for hands
1. Elfrid Payton on the basketball court  2. Nerlens Noel going for a rebound  3. Obi Toppin taking a corner 3
no joke portland should offer nerlens noel like 15 million a season  I would honestly hate to lose him but he's exactly what portland needs
"How would I know exactly what was available in the market, or exactly what attempts were made by the Warriors? That is for the people getting millions in key positions in the org to know.  Information we do have access is related to free agency - Nerlens Noel went for 5 million to NYK. I'm sure he would have been available if we tried to get him.   All we have to go by are the end results of the team put together, and the resultant output was extremely unsatisfactory. Hawks/Phoenix/Philadelphia were able to turn their team around extremely well, and none of them had a tier 1 player like Steph Curry coming back."
I‚Äôm sorry I struck such a nerve with you   But I promise you no one is blaming Randles awful game 1 performance on Nerlens Noel...
Can‚Äôt think of a more teenage thing to do than bring up something completely irrelevant to the topic at hand. Fucking embarrassing after trying to call me out as 15 lmao  Tell you one thing. No Knicks fans are blaming fuckin Nerlens Noel for Randles shit game yesterday
if Nerlens played for the Pels he could be Nawlins Noel. I'll show myself out
I have to admit I didn't have Taj Gibson and Nerlens Noel having meaningful play-off performances on my 2021 bingo card.
"It would be a real shame if the Knicks were to go on a 16-0 tear and upset all of these fine aspiring contenders in the league, culminating in Nerlens Noel winning Finals MVP"
"It is an overpay, because there's more of him. This has become a pattern with rim runners these days. You can find them pretty easily. The 2 coming up pretty quickly are Nerlens Noel and Mitchell Robinson. But there will be others too."
"Nerlens Noel, your 2021 Finals MVP"
"Bro we were literally able to get Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris from moves he made two years prior. He literally said he shuddered at the lost opportunity of signing Robert Covington as an UDFA when Houston picked him up. He didn't just suck and guess, he was building something that stood the test of time (BC and EB). Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel, Richard Holmes, TJ McConnell to name a few pieces that would be really beneficial to contenders not as stars but as high-mid level bench pieces"
Didn‚Äôt you trade an young all star in Jrue Holiday for Nerlens Noel? No reason to trade him
First thing I thought when I saw this post was Fuck I hope this doesn't inflate the price for Nerlens Noel and Mitchell Robinson.
"Oubre, Ja, Claxton, Nerlens Noel, Romeo Langford, DLo, Jordan Clarkson, Jamal Murray, Weley Matthews, Curry, James Wiseman Aaron Gordon, Fox, CP3, Lowry, Justise Winslow, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, PG13, Anfernee Simmons, Melo, there's a lot of cute guys"
"Guys like Nerlens Noel, Mason Plumlee, Derrick Favours, D. Howard were all relatively cheap and available unrestricted free agents. Warriors were better off taking one of those guys than drafting a young raw project."
"Rim-running, shot-blocking centers are undervalued right now. Using the Knicks as an example: Nerlens Noel is on a 1 yr/$5m deal. They're also not in a rush to lock up Mitchell Robinson. If the Cavs don't at least explore the market to see if they can replace a large enough percentage of Allen's production with a player on a much smaller salary, I'd be surprised."
"Lobs and blocks bigs coming up to free agency have to be the biggest headaches for GMs. Capella and Allen types.  These kinds of bigs do very specific things at a high level on defense and are completely dependent on teammates on offense. No matter how good they are at their roles, they are still specialists.   The elite ones are obviously better than, say, Nerlens Noel and Nic Claxton but by how much? Are they 20 million dollars better? Feels like there is always a mature draft pick or a vet big that can come in for cheap and give you 80% of the elite guys value for 20% of the price.   If you have a star guards and wings, you don't need much from your big. But if you have a star defensive big, that doesn't really change what you need from your guards and wings."
Nerlens Noel summed up perfectly (although he's been great this season)
"Ya.  I have. And when you are starting Elfriid Payton Nerlens Noel and Reggie Bullock alongside your star that is a more impressive coaching feat than whenyou have Ayton, Bridges and and a hall of fame point guard to play."
"Dominant.  Loose ball fouls per 100 possessions (minimum 1000 minutes)  1. Dwight Howard, 1.39 2. Isaiah Stewart, 0.91 3. Nerlens Noel, 0.72  Non-charge offensive fouls per 100 possessions (minimum 1000 minutes)  1. Dwight, 1.91 2. KAT, 0.99 3. R. Lopez, 0.77  Offensive goaltending per 100 possessions (minimum 1000 minutes)  1. Dwight, 0.21 2. Jordan, 0.16 3. Holmes, 0.08"
"&gt;League executives also mentioned Bruce Brown, Alex Caruso, Talen Horton-Tucker and Nerlens Noel as players who could be in for significant raises averaging above $12 million per season.  Shit! I am afraid to see what Tim Hardaway is going these guys are getting above $12 million."
Def not Nerlens Noel
"Blah blah blah, Gobert this, dominant defender that, everyone knows that when the Knicks won in 2023 behind FMVP and DPOY Nerlens Noel he cemented himself as the greatest defender of ALL TIME."
"There's no way in hell he could of been ad, maybe he could of been a Nerlens Noel though.  Back then the nba big men were all brutes so wash making him gain weight instead of just utilizing his natural speed quickness advantages were in retrospect a bad move esp because it lead to injuries but he never had the wing skillet of AD who is objectively the most talented player in the entire NBA with really no weakness honestly."
unpopular MVP - Giannis  Unpopular 6MOY - T.J McConnell  unpopular DPOY - Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel for DPOY is the only one I feel strongly about
"Even if Snyder or Monty wins it's hard to deny what an incredible job thibs has done with an underwhelming roster. The other day there was a thread about whether you'd take the memphis core over the knicks. I believe many people including knicks fans chose the memphis core. He's essentially revived careers of Rose and Nerlens Noel. Both of them might receive decent contract offers following this stint. Wouldn't be upset if any of those coaches mentioned wins, but it is interesting to wonder how either of those coaches would fare if they were in thibs shoes."
So like Kyle Lowry vs Nerlens Noel
"I once made a post about how I‚Äôd rather have Nerlens Noel then Clint Capela.   One of them embraced their role and flourished, the other took another few years and is just now becoming playable again.   I was left looking like an idiot."
Thanks for this! One note regarding the Knicks is that Nerlens Noel (41 GS) was the starter for most of the games this year over Mitchell Robinson (29 GS) due to injury.
You‚Äôre more forgiving of BI‚Äôs one sided game than I am. Unlikely that changes haha.   But I do think rim protection is going to be a problem next to Zion forever. You almost need a Nerlens Noel type player on a Nerlens Noel type contract.   Or a Myles Turner who may be the most undervalued player in the league.
"Nerlens ""Advanced Metrics God"" Noel"
Yes they have a lot of room however this FA group isn't really anything to spend big on.  Their main move would be something like getting Randle an extension and retaining Nerlens Noel if possible.  The following year (2022) could be big.
"I mean it's still Julius Randle...  Consider the fact that Thibs is maximizing every single one of his players. Randle, DRose, RJ, Nerlens Noel, Bullock, Burks have all taken these enormous jumps from last year."
"&gt; People point to the Nerlens Noel injury in early 2019, but he'd already halted his dunking beginning in the 2017-18 season.  16-17 is when his dunk rate really dropped (although not much. It dropped from 0.077 and 0.070 to 0.052, and he's back up to 0.065 this year)  By 17-18 it was already becoming a meme.  &gt;[It was said in our Sub but Wiggins must throw down some filthy dunks in practice if they're all always waiting for him to do it in the game.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9xx7p5/bench_reacts_to_wiggins_insane_dunk/e9w0fo1/) - one of the top comments on a 20k upvoted post at the start of 18-19"
"Nerlens Noel is a great defensive Center, but BPM is not a good metric"
Hold up. Nerlens Noel blocked TWENTY dunks this season? That‚Äôs a blocked dunk every 3.5 games. I feel like I only see a couple of those a month across the whole NBA
&gt;DBPM - Nerlens Noel  And people still use BPM as a valid stat
nerlens noel turned down a [70m/4 year extension](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2729163-nerlens-noel-reportedly-turned-down-mavericks-contract-offer-at-175m-per-year.amp.html)
"The confidence you're seeing here is not representative of the fanbase as a whole. The fans had all but given up hope on him overall. Many thought the pick was stupid and were upset after it (the mantra all season was ""Winless for Wiggins"" ). He was picked after jump-starting the process with Jrue for Nerlens (who was looking like a great, young prospect) after all. Everyone's eyes were on wing/guard talent. The fans justified the pick of Okafor because Embiid was such an unknown.  Now there were talks of him being a total monster and shooting threes at practice, but few fans really expected this. After that first game it was over though. He scored like Okafor and defended like Noel and had a ridiculous motor/drive. The city instantly fell in love with him and the rest is history."
I guess this is why Minny fans were so upset with him... the dude has insane athleticism that he seemed to stop using after he flatlined Nerlens Noel.   I like to think here that him walking up slowly helped nobody on the Grizz notice him (when in reality they were really caught ball watching).

NERLENS NOEL DESERVES $70M
The only reason we let this get close is so we could show off how fucking clutch Nerlens Noel is on defense
It wouldn't be a Knicks game without Nerlens Noel being tasked with singlehandedly holding together our entire season.
NERLENS NOEL MARRY ME
Nerlens Noel was going to get drafted #1 overall in the 2013 draft.  Anthony Bennett did get drafted #1 overall.  Hope this answers your question.
What if we throw in Nerlens Noel?
I see you‚Äôre an OKC fan.. are you just basing off this from the time Jerami Grant still on OKC with Paul George and Nerlens Noel shutting Giannis down that one regular season game years ago? Because I can assure you Jerami Grant by his lonesome is not stopping Giannis or any top 10 player at all
"You right dog, we ain‚Äôt ever gonna be able to sign Evan Fournier and Nerlens Noel"
"Knicks were without D rose, Taj Gibson, Nerlens Noel, and Kemba walker. Excuses are lame"
"Oh no you were missing world beater Nerlens Noel and the corpse of Kemba Walker, def comparable to missing Bogi, Cam Reddish, D'Andre Hunter, and Okongwu lol. Only legit piece y'all were missing was D Rose"
"They had Nerlens Noel, Robert Covington and Jerami Grant so yes probably. Also an unproven Richaun Holmes coming off the bench!"
The Kings were so bad that I literally dropped basketball all together for about 4 years thinking they weren‚Äôt worth it. I only came back because the Nerlens Noel draft made take inventory over the whole league and see the sport as enjoyable again especially after I saw the Nuggets Warriors 2013 series that reminded me about the We believe Warriors as they were honestly the fondest memory of basketball going back and including the Bibby Kings. It was a kind of awakening. Basketball can indeed be fun to watch and follow. Then I checked up on the Kings and yeah Cousins happened and I checkup on them every single year and it honestly and the laundry list kept growing.
"It's seriously brutal to watch such good defense go to waste. Like, the defense from the perimeter is really good, leads them to a location where a big man would usually alter the shot the extra amount to make it a miss (Serge, Gasol, etc.)... And no one is there to alter the shot. Like, give us Willie Cauley-Stein or Nerlens Noel and we'll make them look like a DPOY candidate - just someone nearing 7 feet would have given us three more wins instead of losses this year (Detroit, Portland, Chicago, and Dallas all killed us on the inside and we still kept it close)."
"lol... I couldn't understand why they kept forcing the ball to THT instead of just going to AD in the paint again and again.. No one on the Knicks can guard AD  in the paint..not Nerlens Noel, not Mitchell, not Randle.  watching that game nearly drove me mad."
Rich Paul getting ready to give him the nerlens Noel treatment next contract if he keeps this up
Is Nerlens Noel allergic to dunking?
Nerlens Noel...
Remember when Nerlens Noel and Anthony Davis were going to be the best defensive frontcourt in the league
Nerlens Noel revenge game
"Yea but during a 5ish year stretch they drafted Michael Carter Williams, Jahlil Okafor, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Dario Saric, Zhaire Smith, and Nerlens Noel all in the first round. Of those picks only Embiid has worked out for them.   At the start of the process they traded away Jrue Holiday who is a 15-20 ppg perennial DPOY candidate now. He‚Äôs no Embiid but the process is ultimately a failure, as they are looking to ship out Simmons and build up a new team. Ironically Maxey looks like a future all-star and they got him with the 21st pick.   Yes I‚Äôm being petty but I‚Äôve relished in their failed drafting and I think that Hinkie is overrated and actually got out at the perfect time. I‚Äôm a big fan of Embiids game though and hope he wins a ring at some point (with them or somewhere else). I hope OKC follows a similar path."
Let‚Äôs ask Jahlil okafor how great that worked for his development. Ask Nerlens Noel also.  Michael carter Williams developed great playing unlimited minutes on trash teams with no direction.  The rockets are bad but giving these guys structure now benefits them more than bad minutes. Guys can develop in practice too.   Alperen has a fouling problem he‚Äôs had since the Turkish league. It‚Äôs better to fix that problem now rather than hoping he figures it out later considering he couldn‚Äôt just figure it out in the Turkish league either he averaged 28 mpg there.
On Nerlens Noel of all people  21 year old Sengun is gonna be scary
play the uno reverse card and see if he can have the courts force nerlens noel to play for the lakers
"In generell I'm with you, but this is Nerlens Noel and the Sixers. These people know each other on a personal level. Elton Brand worked there, when Noel was drafted. And same Brand (I guess it was him) convinced his owner to invest tens of millions into Noel, called Paul, didn't get an answer, shrugged his shoulders and moved on? This makes no sense to me. We talk about a crazy huge investment, even for billionaires. If my boss sends me to connect to a contracter with a job with a volume of 15k or something and no one picks up, I can't show up again without having tried every connection I have. And Brand apperantly did not. I don't even doubt Paul's misbehavior in this case, I just think Phillies moves are illogical, which makes me wonder if this offer truly existed in the first place. We will see."
Coby White to New York for Nerlens Noel and a protected pick?
Except Nerlens Noel who has said something
Nerlens Noel has. And he found out years later.
Nerlens Noel found out years later‚Ä¶.
Idk I could see this being a Nerlens Noel situation where Keldon thinks he‚Äôs going to get a lot more than he‚Äôs worth. Like Spurs fans probably know better but I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs worth a big contract given his limitations.
Ive seen nerlens noel and noah vonleh clamp up giannis. I think Mutumbo could too.
"Essentially Klutch Sports provided bad council to serve their interests over their perspective client. They had nothing to lose, they knew it was a gamble to not take the money. Yet they still gassed up Noel to drop his agent that was hard line on take the bag (good advice/council), so that they could get him as a client for the off chance (very slim chance) he would get an even bigger payday. Essentially screwing over Nerlens, but not losing anything at all as a company.   Klutch essentially getting called out playing recklessly with other peoples money out of pure greed. They exploited Nerlens that very obviously wasn‚Äôt very smart or money savvy at the time. Sounds like he‚Äôs finally wised up and git the right kind of legal council to settle things once and for all."
"&gt; I 1000% believed years ago that rich paul told him to leave Walter's for a better deal and Noel agreed.  This was confirmed when this story broke:  &gt;During the aforementioned party for Ben Simmons, Paul made a pitch to become Noel‚Äôs agent. Paul represented to Noel that he ‚Äúwas a 100 million man‚Äù and that he would get him a max deal. Paul told Noel that if he terminated his relationship with Mr. Walters and signed with him instead, Paul would get him that ‚Äúmax deal. As part of this, Paul advised Noel that he should cease negotiations with Dallas, accept the single year qualifying offer, and seek a max deal on the free agent market the following season.  &gt;Ultimately, at the behest of Paul, Noel terminated his agency relationship with Happy Walters and ofÔ¨Åcially entered into a contract with Paul on August 21, 2017. [Source](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/08/24/nerlens-noel-suing-agent-rich-paul/)"
Name a single one of his guys who hasn‚Äôt pulled something like this because he said to? He fucked over Nerlens Noel and has completely shit the bed on this one. Once he gets found guilty in that court case I hope he has to stop being an agent
"Anthony Bennett wasn't expected to go number 1 though, yeah he was ranked #7 on ESPN's high school ranking system but in mock drafts he was expected to go at the earliest 4 and at the latest 10th. That 2013 draft class was just considered a weak draft in general with Nerlens Noel considered the #1 pick until he got hurt in college. There's just to much uncertainty when it comes to drafting players in general to really say if coming straight out of high school is a great or terrible move because players like KG, Kobe, LeBron, Howard, T-Mac, Lou Will , Monta Ellis, and Amare Stoudemire came straight from high school but might they might be exceptions to the rule."
OR players see the Lebron connection and are afraid of repercussions for speaking up. We all know rich Paul is essentially Lebrons mouth piece. You honestly think nerlens noel was the only one getting that treatment? If he was then the nba should definitely look into why only nerlens was getting that shitty of service.
"Also, don‚Äôt forget the Nerlens Noel debacle"
"They wouldn't be the best by any means, but you could build a solid team from former sixers. A lot of the process guys turned out to be damn good elsewhere.  PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: Butler  SF: RoCo  PF: Jerami Grant  C: Christian Wood  Bench: Richaun Holmes, Fultz, Dario, Nerlens Noel, Iguadala, T.J McConnell, Thaddeus Young"
"The narrative on Jrue flips on a monthly basis in these parts. I remember when the Pels acquired Jrue for Nerlens Noel on draft night and everyone went crazy because of the ""twin towers"" potential we missed out on. After the Pels upset the Blazers a few years ago with Jrue shutting down Dame people said he was criminally underrated (which was a good take) to the point he was then overrated (ppl saying he's better than Dame). Then he had injury issues and everyone forgot how good he is. Rinse and repeat with the ""what have you done for me lately"" and we are where we are now.  IMO it is a win win trade. Just depends on how the Pels use their draft picks. If Griffin is still running things I think most will be wasted. I have no idea what his plan is but it does not look good."
Except for the fact that rich Paul potentially screwed Nerlens Noel out of millions. Usually good agents don‚Äôt do that
"&gt;Ben simmons saga, the AD trade,  Damn players didn't force trades before that? So was Kyrie managed by Klutch in the summer of 2017? Was Chuck managed by Klutch in 1992?   &gt;Nerlens Noel stuff  Sure that wasn't a bad situation. But if it's the only bad thing you can find it's pretty easy to forgive."
"The shit he‚Äôs pulling with the Ben simmons saga, the AD trade, the Nerlens Noel stuff, I‚Äôm sure there are other reasons to not like rich Paul."
"I didn't think Taj Gibson was washed, however I did not think he'd be this impactful on the Knicks over the last three seasons. After 2019 I thought he'd just retire after playing for his hometown team. Got one last good contract, solid vet presence for a younger Mitchell Robinson. Then the lockout cut the season short and most figured that'd be it for Taj.  Unfortunately Mitchell Robinson and Nerlens Noel are made of glass, so we brought him back in 2020. He was holding it down, taking on an awesome second center off the bench role after Nerlens took over as a starter...or starting himself whenever Nerlens would inevitably get injured. Taj was still playing so well despite an eye injury that he was dubbed ""Taj-1000"" after the Terminator for his domination in the paint and putback prowess.  This season, because Mitch and Nerlens continue to find ways to get injured, Taj is still getting worthwhile minutes and being an overall positive off the bench and sometimes even starting. I don't think most people expected Taj to be getting this much playtime this late in his career, but overall he's been a solid and most importantly **available** center in our rotation. Great way to potentially end a career playing for your hometown."
"Nerlens Noel looks at Simmons, mouths ""*Gettt ouuut*"""
"Have they don't some suspect shit? I mean the Ben Simmons situation, forcing AD out of NOLA, Nerlens Noel situation, but this dude gets his guys money. You hear about Klutch more because of LeBron"
Isn‚Äôt Miles part of Klutch? Rich Paul gonna pull  a Nerlens Noel on him now that he called MJ the GOAT
If we have taj gibson and nerlens Noel willing to shoot 3s and Ben doesn‚Äôt I‚Äôll take him off the court myself for being a pussy.
Ask Nerlens Noel how good Rich Paul was at getting him paid.
How is rich still an agent? He needs to quit after the nerlens noel debacle
He was scared of his own power after almost killing Nerlens Noel.
"The pelicans also traded the pick that became nerlens Noel, who would have probably gone number 1 if he wasn‚Äôt injured, for jrue. It‚Äôs not like jrue was some down on his luck guy they picked up for super low value"

"&gt;With what he pulled with AD, now Ben Simmons and a potential Nerlens    Noel lawsuit incoming, could it actually happen? Has any other agent in    sports caused this much trouble before?  What exactly do you think Paul did with AD &amp; Simmons that would be grounds fro disbarment ?  For a serious post, there is a serious lack of substance.  The Nerlens Noel case could be something if its true he neglected his duties to his client by not receiving and informing Noel of legitimate offers."
"Kemba has fit well offensively, but he really hurts our defense. I still think we are probably a playoff team (I would be surprised if we weren't at least play-in) but we have to get our defense back to what it was last year if we want to be a lock. Luckily, Nerlens Noel came back and really helped out against the bucks last night, so I am tentatively hopeful."

"&gt;  BS's camp miscalculated his trade value  And not only that, but now going the mental-health route to get out of this hole they've dug has completely tanked BS' PR image and marketability.     No lucrative side deals for him. I guarantee Rich Paul orchestrated this entire mess as payback for the Nerlens Noel story getting leaked. His representation of his clients is no longer being held in good faith, and I hope he faces the music for it one day (it'd be especially sweet if BS takes legal action against him for PR damages /  losses in endorsements etc)"
Nerlens ‚ÄúBartholomew Kuma‚Äù Noel
"This is a great post. They key word here is Rich Paul. He was essentially a low level jersey salesman that got lifted by Lebron James out of the dregs. Paul is not qualified or has the proper training to be a major agent.  If you believe Nerlens Noel, Paul screwed him out of 70 million dollars and then Paul also helped Anthony Davis force his way out of New Orleans. Paul gives bad advice and is a scummy agent even in comparison to the others in his profession full of scummy people."
"&gt;‚ÄúAfter being fined for missing Philadelphia‚Äôs preseason loss to the Toronto Raptors on Monday night ‚Äî a penalty of roughly $360,000 ‚Äî Simmons‚Äô representation had another discussion with the players association in which it was reiterated they would be unable to recoup the money being deducted from the $8.25 million sitting in escrow, sources say, and it was communicated to the Sixers that these early fines were perhaps higher than they expected.‚Äù  You said ""Simmons would be provided counsel and advice from his agent who just happens to be the most powerful agent in all of basketball."" That most powerful agent already gave him bad advice. Why would you keep trusting his advice lol. Google also Rich Paul/Nerlens Noel."
Nerlens Noel is maa booii
*Nerlens Noel has entered the chat*
Bro that Nerlens Noel story has made me just disgusted in Klutch forever. Watched him play at UK and I‚Äôm still in shock that they wouldn‚Äôt even answer team‚Äôs calls. Beyond fucked.
Who do you think relieved Dennis Schroder and Nerlens Noel of their sacks of money?
Not the person you are responding to but he has a habit of only caring about his biggest clients to the point that when teams call about smaller clients he ignores their phone calls.  [Here is a recent example of how bad he sucks at his job.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32079344/new-york-knicks-nerlens-noel-sues-rich-paul-klutch-claiming-loss-58m-potential-salary)
"Yes because he's such a good agent, example: nerlens noel &amp; Ben Simmons"
OKCs best free agent ever is Nerlens Noel lol.
"Well I traded Tatum who was destroying my FG% for AD. My complete team is LeBron, AD, Ja, Kyrie, Rob Williams, Jalen Suggs, Pat Mills, Joe Harris, Nerlens Noel, Mobley, and DeAndre Hunter"
"[DailyKnicks.com article: Nerlens Wall](https://dailyknicks.com/2021/04/21/ny-knicks-nerlens-noel-2nd-entire-nba-statistic/). Fuck off, you mental midget."
"Nerlens Noel once went up to the media workroom at halftime to grab a hot dog from the food set out for the reporters.  ‚ÄúI needed some energy for the second half,‚Äù he told SB Nation (he was actually a DNP-CD for that game).  [https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/12/4/16733596/nerlens-noel-hot-dog-mavericks-carlisle-halftime-controversy](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/12/4/16733596/nerlens-noel-hot-dog-mavericks-carlisle-halftime-controversy)"
"Quickley, Obidiah toppin, Nerlens noel and 2 FRPs for Tatum."
"That‚Äôs becUse the qualification this year is 93 minutes played for a statistic that is essentially prorating by possession.   Iggy plays bench minutes on a good defensive team, while being a good defender.   Jokic plays the most minutes a game for the Nuggets and the Nuggets are the 2nd ranked defence.   If you took raptor for last year with a 750 minute qualifier.   D-Raptor - 1. Gobert 2. Capela 3. Poeltl 4. Thybulle 5. Turner 6. Embiid  O-Raptor - 1. Curry 2. Jokic 3. Lillard 4. Harden 5. Doncic 6. Kawhi  Total Raptor - 1. Jokic 2. Embiid 3. Gobert 4. Kawhi 5. Conley 6. Curry   Using BPM  DBPM - 1. Nerlens Noel 2. Draymond Green 3. Giannis 4. Jokic 5. Butler 6. Gobert  OBPM - 1. Jokic 2. Curry 3. Lillard 4. Giannis 5. Embiid 6. Harden  BPM - 1. Jokic 2. Giannis 3. Curry 4. Butler 5. Lebron 6. Embiid   So when looking at both list from last years data there are clear flaws to both list. For the most part they do a decent job, and for something like RAPTOR you can change the qualification of minutes required so if you want to see players that barely played you can, or if you want only the most played players in the league you can.  So if you think RAPTOR is flawed since he is the 7th best defender by the metric this year while being the leading minutes per game playing the 5 on the 2nd ranked defence. But for some reason fail to acknowledge that BPM had him as the 4th best defender last year"
"He didn‚Äôt really break out until year 5 and was on his 3rd team at that point.               Nerlens Noel, Cody Zeller, and Ben Mclemore spent time as the #1 prospect. That draft class was so bad at the top."
Yeah but there was very little consensus in mock drafts that year besides a lot of people putting nerlens noel 1 or 2. Bennett was higher on average but some boards had Bennett at 8 and some also had McCollum there.
"That was a crazy draft, nerlens Noel was supposed to go top 3 and the cavs picked fuckin Anthony Bennett for reasons I still don't understand"
I mean anything you say about the defense has to come with the note that we haven't even had Nerlens Noel yet.
"You're right that his situation isn't ""awful"" in the sense of being in abject poverty or whatever. But still, we're on a basketball forum and nobody truly believes these people have big misfortunes. So it's weird to see you bringing up that point as though it's worth debating. Like, you could say that about almost any bad thing. Agent screws over Nerlens Noel, ""Oh he's still rich."" Yeah and?"
Worked well for Nerlens Noel.
"I‚Äôd rather just roll with what we have than trade PJ *and* Kai. Kai obviously isn‚Äôt ready to contribute now, but he‚Äôs got crazy potential. We‚Äôre playing really well this season, but we‚Äôre not a Myles Turner away from being a championship contender. Next years the point where I‚Äôd feel comfortable trading future assets for win now pieces.   I could maybe be convinced to do a deal around just PJ, but Oubre would basically have to be included to match salaries. I feel like PJ + Oubre + the Pelicans Pick for Turner is a pretty decent offer, especially since Turner has some injury concerns and has been on the trade block for years.  I‚Äôd probably prefer to find a smaller trade for a decent enough center though. Ideally we‚Äôd want to keep PJ as the backup center. My dream trade was gonna be Oubre + Plumlee for Steven Adams, so that the Grizzlies could clear cap space, but he‚Äôs been killing it with them. Another target might be Nerlens Noel, since Mitchell Robinsons has improved a ton this season. Naz Reid would also be a big upgrade over Plumlee. Maybe the Timberwolves would want both McDaniels brothers (and other stuff)?"
"If the 76ers had been totally honest about Jrue's medical report they likely would have taken at 6, instead of drafting Nerlens Noel and shipping him to Philly."
"idk what that guys is talking about. Knicks starting 5 is nothing special when comparing with other playoff teams.   Where the Knicks are strongest is they have one of the strongest bench units in the league. Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Obi Toppin, Immanuel Quickley, Nerlens Noel (once he comes back from injury). Knicks bench regularly scores 40-50 points a game between them."
He looks huge now. He was never quite as thin as Nerlens Noel but damn he really added some muscle mass to go with that 7 foot frame
The fact that the Knicks just have an extra Nerlens Noel lying around is wild. DEPTH.
I‚Äôm just following his past actions. Not really a reach to say an agent that didn‚Äôt do his job before continues to not do his job. Unless he‚Äôs got some weird vendetta against only Nerlens Noel that no one knows about.
Remember when Rich Paul left Nerlens Noel to do all his negotiations with NY on his own and now wants his commission on that deal? Who says he had anything to do with this.
"thats true but if you shuffle the pieces around luka and KP their team defense could improve too.  I thought they should have made a play for nerlens noel last year and run him at C.   if they can pry valanciunas away from new orleans he would totally revitalize their defense.   but they need to get the guys signed, the mavs have run the same starting lineup for 3 straight years at this point  the mavs are like obsessed with starting dwight powell at center and he's just awful.   he's got butterfingers and he can't defend for shit.   mavs fans theorize that cuban is fixated on trying to make dwight powell work because he came along with rondo in the disastrous trade with boston and given rondo's infamous exit cuban is obsessed with trying to ""win"" that trade by making powell a thing.  offensively the KP/luka pairing was their most effective scoring engine last year, if they are going to move on from that it needs to be replaced with something better not just bumping maxi kleber up in the rotation"
Nerlens Noel isn‚Äôt back yet and the Knicks haven‚Äôt even solved their 4th quarter problem. They can definitely take it up another notch.
"10 million for Alec Burks is a great deal, good shot creator and 3 point shooter who plays good defense. U should be way more mad about the Nerlens Noel deal  Regardless we had a great offseason and we have team options on every contract"

"Exactly, when nerlens noel declined 70 million, plenty of other teams were waiting to offer the same. Oh wait a minute"
Nerlens Noel is the club president
The Nerlens Noel way
he must have same agent like nerlens noel :(
Nerlens Noel is his team mate do you remember the contract he turned down and then got hurt?   Secure the bag.
"This is more like Nerlens Noel. He turned down like 70 million for 4 years from the Mavs. He got hurt, didn‚Äôt play well and ended up having to settle for prove it bet deals for a couple of years. He got the bag from the Knicks but even then I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs still gotten the same amount of money as the Mavs deal."
He pulling a Nerlens Noel out here.
"tough to watch? i don‚Äôt feel bad in the slightest, he got greedy and it didn‚Äôt pay off. He shit the bed in the playoffs and disappeared for major moments in his one playoff series, he got offered a contract that was way more than fair for how he was playing. A true Nerlens Noel situation."
I think that award goes to Nerlens Noel.
"We call that the ""Nerlens Noel"""
"I mean that's what his agent did and he turned it down, that ain't the agents fault. Nerlens Noel agent did the same thing and when he turned the deal down his agent literally quit."
Based off similar cases like Nerlens Noel and KCP I heavily doubt that happens
"Dennis"" nerlens noel"" schroder"
"Derrick Rose, Immanuel Quickley, Alec Burks, Obi Toppin, Nerlens Noel.  That team would get a few wins against some starting lineups.  Its the Knicks, all day."
Schroder turning down that contract is gonna be another Nerlens Noel story
Nerlens Noel has joined the chat
"Schroeder on which contract situation is comparable to him,"" I don't compare myself to anyone,"" Then he rolled up his sleeve showing a tattoo of Nerlens Noel. ""I'll let you interpret that however you want."""
The Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel
The new nerlens noel
"Probably because OKC is one of the smallest, if not the smallest, market team in the NBA and they need to build and maintain themselves a reputation of treating their players right. It'll go a long way in actually being able to sign FAs. Outside of resigns, the biggest FA we've signed is...Nerlens Noel I think?"
"You think Nerlens is great because he's cheap.  If you were paying Nerlens Noel 4-years/72M like he turned down from Dallas, you would hate him."
"Or get hurt.  Or completely underwhelm and ruin his own market.   When you‚Äôre a young guy you take the money 10/10 times. Guys like Melo who have a careers worth of earnings can play for cheap, guys like Nunn should take the most available they can get.  It‚Äôs definitely not the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù move.  Nerlens Noel bet on himself, Boogie bet on himself and look how that has turned out."
&gt; This tops Sprewell and Nerlens Noel for one of the stupidest free agent decisions in a long time  Calm down. After we see what he makes over the next 4 years you can make that determination.
"He just came off a contract where he made 70 fucking million dollars   Lakers offer him 84M and he refused because he wanted 16M more   How many people in the entire world, celebrities and athletes alike, would turn down a guaranteed 84M or 21M a year in hope they get 16M more   And the 84M was also guaranteeing him living in a warm environment in LA which he has stated many times that he loves living in Cali  This tops Sprewell and Nerlens Noel for one of the stupidest free agent decisions in a long time  The only player who made a bigger error in FA was Scottie Pippen"
The Nerlens Noel thing seems to put one thing into perspective: don‚Äôt give up on athletic defensive anchors with rim running capabilities. They‚Äôll figure it out and settle into their role eventually. Might take 10 years but it‚Äôll happen.  Edit: except for Andre Drummond who seemingly had it figured out and then regressed every season afterwards
For every Fred VanVleet there is a Dennis Schroeder and Nerlens Noel
"Nerlens noel anchored a top 5 defense last season. Yes he has his flaws (brick hands, susceptibility to being bodied for rebounds) but his rim protection is something NOBODY on the mavs has. Not even KP.    &gt; If Nerlen Noels is an answer to the question ‚Äúhow does a team upgrade at Center‚Äù, then the team has problems   My fellow redditor not being able to see the flaws of the mavs offseason has me feeling like I'm taking crazy pills. When they lost in the playoffs, we were all in here saying that cuban NEEDS to get Luka some help - their biggest needs being a secondary playmaker, someone who can take some of the scoring load, and a quality starting center that pairs next to KP... now I still think there's time to get that playmaker but so far the answer to all these questions is Reggie bullock and everyone is happy with that? Bullock is nice but what? He can't dribble either. He's timmy if timmy gave up just a hint of shooting in exchange for defense."
"Nerlens Noel wasv signed on a minimum deal in OKC a couple of years back, rehabbed his image, signed a bigger deal with Knicks last year, and signed a proper big contract this year. He went from below 2m that first year in OKC, to just signing a 10m/year contract."
I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôve probably never seen Nerlens Noel try and play basketball on offense
Nerlens Noel
"They signed Nerlens Noel who was a great defensive anchor (led the league in blocks?)   They resigned Rose who was phenomenal for 20-25 minutes and literally carried us to our single W in the playoffs.   They resigned Burks who was a much needed scorer and creator off the bench to 10 mil a year   They signed Fournier, who‚Äôs a 3 level scorer that will bring much needed scoring to the starting unit.   We tried to sign Lowry but he wanted MIA. We need another point guard for sure but I think we did pretty decent. I personally think we‚Äôre gonna end up trading for a point guard at some point this season"
Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel's agent literally resigned after Noel wouldn't listen to him when his agent told him to take the bag he turned down
Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel nodded

Reminds me of Nerlens Noel screwing up
Nerlens Noel enters the chat
Definitely Nerlens Noel. Dude turned down a 4 years - 70m and ended up signing a contract one year for four mil.
Nerlens Noel don‚Äôt think others come close
"Nerlens Noel turned down a 70m deal with us ,and ended up getting the minimum until he just got this new contract. At least he finally got it though lol"
"Nerlens Noel did the same a few years back in Dallas. A restricted free agent at the time, he was offered 4 yrs $70 million. Noel wound up signing a one-year, $4.1 million qualifying offer instead. Glad to see he finally got paid by the Knicks after a good year."
Nerlens Noel springs to mind.
Nerlens Noel too. Passed up that big contract in Dallas only to sign essentially vet min deals for a few years. I don't even think he's made up the money he turned down since then.
Oladipo and Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel
"Nerlens. Noel.  that's the list lol  edit: how could I forget Oladipo lol  we could make a team out of this soon! Schroder, Oladipo, Noel. Find a 3 and 4 who screwed themselves and we're set"
no one did it worse than Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel  George Hill  KCP
Nerlens Noel   Isaiah Thomas (mini)
Nerlens Noel and DeMarcus Cousins.
Nerlens Noel was the worst recent example I can think of.
"I know I been kind of hating on the mavs lately but imo its really bad they couldn't secure neither richaun Holmes, nerlens noel, or another solid center. The mavs are so thin at that spot they can't afford to lose Willie cauley stein but they got both Reggie bullock and Hardaway Jr."
This man about to Nerlens Noel himself
He‚Äôs gonna end up like Nerlens Noel at this rate.
"this gonna be another Nerlens Noel situation, take the freaking money"
I will never understand NBA egos. How tf can you be Nerlens Noel and think you‚Äôre gonna get maxed
"Nerlens Noel.  Underrated part of that deal is that because of how small the qualifying offer was, even if he'd gotten the max the following year, he would still have made less tha the 77+ million the mavs were offering him over that 4 year span.  His agents were so stupid lol."
Nerlens Noel 2.0
Didn‚Äôt Nerlens Noel turn Down a max contract once only to get the min?  DS isn‚Äôt that bad from that perspective haha
No idea what you‚Äôre arguing against. I‚Äôm not saying any of those signings are bad. The only move I‚Äôm not crazy about is Nerlens Noel but even that one is okay and not terrible. I‚Äôm saying this sub is hot garbage. Go compare the comments in the Fournier signing thread to the THJ signing thread and I promise you you‚Äôll get dumber.
"Dude already made 70 million in the league, I‚Äôd much rather be him that Nerlens Noel tbh"
"That‚Äôs just absolutely not true, look at a guy like Nerlens Noel who turned down 4/72 and signed a 1-year deal only for it to backfire."
"No, he brought in shitty players. No one would want or pay for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Nerlens Noel, or Christian Wood on their rosters to support their stars."
"Alec Burks, Nerlens Noel, and Evan Fournier.  The $140mil in contracts the Knicks have given so far today"
Noel: Never wanted that 70M contract anyways.  Nerlens ‚Äúhardest road‚Äù Noel.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2017/8/26/16209330/nerlens-noel-agent-happy-walters-mark-cuban-mavericks-free-agency  His agent was Happy Walters when he turned it down. And then hired Rich Paul when he signed the qualifying offer.
"Nerlens Noel would've been absolutely incredible here, but I'm guessing he wanted the playing time with the Knicks"
Does Nerlens Noel ring a bell?
Shams has breaking news for actual stars and woj only has nerlens Noel and olynyk? Woj is losing his touch
Richaun Holmes was *way* better than him last year. Nerlens Noel was *way* better than him last year.
"Mavs fans wanna join our Thunder FA club?  Where we expect nothing and then get hyped for Anthony Morrow, Mike Muscala, and Nerlens Noel signings?"
"Your telling me everyone in here watches cavs games? lol none of you know Allen's value especially at 23. Maybe it's overpay, or maybe the cavs just solidified their front court of the future. Waaaay too early to call all you dirty nephews with sayin ""lol overpay"" but u think nerlens ""can't even touch capela"" Noel is the answer? Smh my head"
The best FA we've ever signed was Nerlens Noel lmao
Got greedy; probably same manager as Nerlens Noel.
Nerlens Noel is the best for-bargain defensive anchor you're gonna get right now. He anchored the Knicks top defense when Taj Gibson wasn't on the floor(and Mitchell Robinson went down with injury). He will excel with a playoff team who has scoring options already.
"Holy shit, those are some extreme bottom of the barrel selections.  Is Nerlens Noel starting to be ""properly rated"" at this point? I mean obviously he has to regret turning down that bag from Dallas and I imagine he'll get some traction in free agency but I'm wondering if he'll get more than the MLE.  He seems like a fantastic backup center but I don't know if I've seen enough from him in the past few years to see if he's truly starting caliber or not."
i know it's a loooooooooooot of money but Dipo made over 100 million in his career already. how much would his life change if he gets another 100m on top instead of the amount of $ he gets now? Even someone like Nerlens Noel who fucked up even more still will make 40-50 million once his career is done.
"Nerlens Noel isnt that good and thats coming from someone who watched atleast 60 knicks games this season living in NY.  He has god awful hands on offense, doesn‚Äôt set good screens (constantly trying to slip) and on defense hes not even as good as geriatric Taj Gibson. He constantly gets overworked by more physical bigs and hes not that strong either so hell get muscled out on the boards. He‚Äôs not that fast and because of his terrible hands hes not much of a lob threat. He has really active hands and he‚Äôs long though. Guys like Nerlens basically grow on trees with how frequently players like him are part of the draft process."
Nerlens Noel
"Mitchell Robinson is a little overrated, he‚Äôs closer to Nerlens Noel than he is to a top 10 Center."
Yea but nerlens noel was not that guy. He should‚Äôve took the money.
I dont know anybody who's cost himself more $$ in a long long time than Oladipo. Turned down 4 yrs $113 mil last off season from Indy. Now he's scrapping at minimums. Even Nerlens Noel didnt turn down anything like that with Dal.
"BTW, a key part of the Bucks' recent finals run was the first victim of the Process - Jrue Holiday was shipped out of town for the Nerlens Noel pick.  Note that he was on-sold by New Orleans to the Bucks for a decent pile of picks, plus the ghost of Eric Bledsoe ..."
"Well if you‚Äôre actually asking, Noel could easily have been the backup center for JoJo in a Dwight type role so drafting Joel made sense. MCW was seen as a jack of all trades and was pretty decent his rookie year but never put it together. Saric was a floor spacing 4 that spread the floor for jo, mcw and nerlens.   Jah was an insurance policy in case Embiid couldn‚Äôt stay healthy (and tbf, at the time he genuinely looked like one of the best players in the draft to a lot of people).   Simmons was supposed to be MCW 2.0, which he was but Philly hopefuls planned on him to improve his shot over his career which was clearly never gonna happen.   Fultz was supposed to be the first true actual point guard with a jumpshot that would allow Ben to move down to the 4 spot so you can‚Äôt run traditional basketball actions like the p&amp;r with a player who teams don‚Äôt even defend on the perimeter in Ben.   So overall, assuming they kept all the guys, a hypothetical lineup would‚Äôve looked something like   Fultz  Sg  Sf   Ben/Saric  Embiid/Noel  With okafor being the odd man out at the end of the rotation. It actually would‚Äôve been pretty decent had fultz not forgotten how to shoot"
"Didn‚Äôt you guys draft MCW, Nerlens Noel, Fultz, Evan Turner with lottery picks? Lmao maybe worry about your garbage truck on fire of a franchise instead. Lost on purpose for years, we won two rings and lost the entire big three/and still got to the finals before you sorry ass losers"
"Huh?   Which player averaged 30 pts &amp; 12 rebounds in the playoffs vs the Hawks on a torn meniscus?   Which player was a legitimate MVP candidate?   And Ben took all of 7 shots in the 4th quarters of the series and passed up a go ahead dunk late in Game 7?   Ben has never improved on the offensive side of the ball since his rookie season.  Embiid improved himself from a platoon center (sharing the post with Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor), to and All Star to an MVP candidate.    If Ben had simply improved himself to merely league averages in shooting &amp; free throws, the Sixers would have a title by now.  He's too arrogant for merely being a good player.  Shooting 33% from the line in the playoffs and disappearing late in games is not the mark of a max contract player and he should have taken whatever steps to make himself better, instead of throwing a hissy fit because the team who paid him $30+ million per season wants him to not be a liability on the offensive end and not get bullied off the court by a 6'1 , unathletic ball hog.     He didn't get thrown under the bus, he practically laid down and crawled there himself."
Nerlens ‚ÄòBritney Spears‚Äô Noel
"Nerlens ""Leah Remini"" Noel"
"(funny, didn't klutch try to sue nerlens noel for the agent's percentage of a contract he negotiated for himself because his agent wasn't doing shit...?  but it's pretty clear ben is acting with his agent's support, here.)"
Nah Dennis had nice lobs to Nerlens Noel.
Pelicans  2011: Josh Harrellson -&gt; Andrew Goudelock  2012: Anthony Davis -&gt; Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  2013: Nerlens Noel -&gt; Ben McLemore (pick was traded for Jrue Holiday)  2014: No Pick  2015: Branden Dawson -&gt; Nikola Radiƒçeviƒá
I don‚Äôt even think Nerlens Noel averaged 20 ppg in highschool.
I think that you just have to prove it in court to a degree that a reasonable person would conclude they were dogging it. Malpractice and negligence lawsuits deal with this pretty normally AFAIK. Nerlens Noel is suing Rich Paul the same way right now. Simmons refusing to show up for practice is probably a very strong point that they would start from.
"It's the same type of case Nerlens Noel is bringing against Rich Paul, seeking to demonstrate that he did not fulfill his obligation to actually perform the job to the best of his ability."
Kemba Walker: Tim Hardaway  Evan Fournier: Marco Belinelli  RJ Barrett:  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle: David Lee  Nerlens Noel: Dikembe Mutombo

"Even if they move him, they are not gonna get a fair return, so they might as well keep him. The Celtics problem is that their bench sucks and is filled with G-Leaguers and players who barely know how to play basketball in terms of NBA level. They need better depth and they already have their center in Robert Williams, but he is injury prone so they might as well stack up and get a better backup center (TT is not it) and a more reliable center (someone like Nerlens Noel)."
"that doesnt excuse trading for nerlens noel, who can only play center, drafting embiid (whos really really goos, but again can only play center) and jahlil okafor, who can again only play center."
"For some reason, I read this headline as Intel, the chip maker, commenting on Nerlens Noel."
"&gt;Only blunder is Fultz,  ???????????  Fultz, Okafor, and Nerlens Noel.  They missed on 3 out of 5 during prime Process years, and they basically bet the franchise on those guys."
Nerlens Noel-ed
Nerlens Noel would never
"Can we name a few? Not challenging you or saying you‚Äôre wrong, but not many really come to mind for me for picks that high.  On the other hand you‚Äôve got people like Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, Harry Giles, WCS, Mo Bamba, Cody Zeller, etc, all off the top of my head who never really panned out. Feel like there‚Äôs tons in the opposite direction."
"&gt; nobody does that.  well, there was the legend nerlens noel"
1. Jarrett Allen  2. Richuan Holmes  3. Nerlens Noel 4. Bobby Portis
"Ah, I knew they had one natural pick from before Hinkie was hired and then another pick which they got for Jrue Holiday, and that it was Nerlens Noel. I thought it was #11 instead of #6 though."
"Correction for 2013: The Sixers traded all-star Jrue Holiday for pick #6 in that draft which was Nerlens Noel.  That was the move that really kicked off the Process, so you should look at #6 in those other time periods rather than #11."
"Jarrett Allen, as least during his time in Cleveland, was not that good on defense. He is big, but skinny and kinda slow. He was out of position a lot and didn't bring a ton of energy on that end. The other personnel and scheme on the floor didn't help much either, and the whole team was pretty bad on defense after Larry Nance was injured.   I was looking into some of the advanced stats a little while back - I think dunks and threes had him ranked as the 41st defensive center. If the Raps really want to have a good defense, they should try to get Poeltl back from San Antonio or sign Nerlens Noel."
it likely will.  his body is nearly identical to Nerlens Noel and he's never been able to really fill out.  wouldn't expect any different from Mobley.
"He would have had more home runs like Jahlil Okafor and Michael Carter-Williams? The Jrue Holiday - Nerlens Noel trade?   I'm not saying it can't succeed, but I'm saying it's the easy part of a GM's job, to sell everybody, to take in bad contracts.  And it's a way to sell hope to your fans."
"&gt; use the MLE on a guy like Nerlens Noel  Nerlens is getting more than the MLE  &gt; JJ Reddick, Wesley Matthews   Both quite washed   &gt; Danny Green  Probably getting more than the min   Lebron and Russ playing at the same time is probably not going to work as well as Lebron and KCP. That said, when Lebron is off the floor it's probably better. In the playoffs they're worse but in the regular season it may give Lebron enough to coast.   Though at this point you have Westbrook who seems to have a major injury every year, AD who is injured often, and Lebron who seems to be finally getting the effects of aging"
That‚Äôs Nerlens Noel music
Yeah I was so pissed they didnt draft nerlens noel but like.. what did we really miss
"To me that doesn't make sense. How do Russ and LeBron work together?  Both of them need the ball to be effective, and neither of them can shoot that well (esp. Russ). Who's bringing the  ball up the court? Even if they split those posessions, what's the idea behind that offense? Suddenly LeBron starts shooting 40% from 3, and Russ keeps feeding everyone?  I just don't get how this trade makes the Lakers better. Russ is going to be the starting PG 100%, but he needs the ball to be effective, like LeBron. IMO, the Lakers needed to swing for Duncan Robinson and Reggie Jackson. Add another big that can hold the fort while AD is gone, or not playing centre, and trade Kuzma plus some picks for someone that will actually contribute to the team. Get a Wayne Ellington, try to sign Nerlens Noel (don't leave the Knicks baby), couple of players that complement the team structure.  With just LeBron and AD healthy, and a decent backup team, they can win the title. Russ, to me, doesn't push them over the edge like a superteam."
"As a Sixers fan who doesn't love Ben, they still didn't ask for enough.   Wiseman and Wiggins aren't worth much, if anything. Wiggins does not contribute to winning. He is in for salary reasons. Wiseman was a mess last year. Will he be better than a Nerlens Noel type? That trade is just picks."
"I think it actually helped those guys on an individual level. They gave a lot of players actual minutes to grow and develop against top talent, rather than sit on the back of the bench and only play 3-on-3 at the end of practice. And look at Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, even Nerlens Noel now as well. They're all doing awesome around the league"
"Just because you reject an offer doesn't mean you'll get a better one. See Noel, Nerlens."
"i think lil nas X looks most like nerlens noel, finally realized it yesterday he always looked familiar. kinda noel/jimmy mix"
"These are leaked vaguely intentionally, stuff like conditions on picks, the years of the pick swaps etc often are leaked in a way to mislead on purpose. Sixers when they traded Nerlens Noel leaked to Woj that they ""were trading him for a first"" and it turned out there was almost zero chane that pick would actually end up being a first.  More interesting to me is potentially looking for picks as main part of return when this is a win now timeline for them"
"Nerlens Noel wore number 5 to remind the 5 teams that passed him on. Follow his career path, J Suggs."
"Sure!  1. Adrian Dantley 2. Alex English 3. Wilkins 4. Kidd 5. Melo 6. Pau Gasol 7. Tony Parker 8. Chris Mullin 9. Mitch Redmond 10. Webber 11. Penny Hardaway 12. Brandon Roy 13. David West 14. Zach Randolph 15. Prince 16. Rudy Gobert 17. Mark Eaton 18. Richard Jefferson 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Demar DeRozan 21. Deandre Jordan 22. Devontae Graham 23. Aaron Gordon 24. Josh Richardson 25. Ramon Sessions 26. Juan Toscano-Anderson 27. Nerlens Noel 28. Maxi Kleber 29. Eric Bledsoe 30. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  These thirty are all convincingly ahead of him too imo, so that eliminates him from being top sixty."
"Not IMO, just simply because he wasn't hyped and shouldn't have been first pick.  Like Nerlens Noel would've been picked first that year if he didn't get injured before the draft. It was a terrible draft lol"
"On the other hand, I think I remember Nerlens Noel saying something similar..."
Probably asking Nerlens Noel the best spots to shop at
"honestly respect for straight up saying it, you gotta have that kind of confidence to be a standout in the league  obviously just having the confidence alone isnt enough though, eh nerlens noel?"
"Not nearly as bad as Nerlens Noel, but it's up there in terms of lost money."
"Nice of you to talk about Nerlens Noel in such high regard, but I think you forgot about Joel Embiid"
Nerlens Noel
Nerlens Noel
1. Nerlens Noel  2. Victor Oladipo  3. Otto Porter  4. Ben Mclemore  5. Alex Len  It was a shit class in general lol
"He played half the season and didn't move the needle. He lost his minutes to Powell who is a stronger body. I wish we spent that money on Nerlens Noel but that's our GM for ya, not sure if he even watches ball sometimes man."
"You're right. Checking the original draft thread, there's no one really saying he was the best player and should have gone number 1. A surprising amount of hype around Nerlens Noel though, which is surprising.   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2973ts/2014\_draft\_3\_pick\_joel\_embiid\_kansas/"
Yeah you‚Äôre right we should‚Äôve passed on Embiid because we already had Nerlens Noel
"It was such a weird draft, the mocks were all over the place with no real consensus. But iirc I think Oladipo was often at 1 (he went 2nd) and Nerlens Noel was at 1 but then he got injured and fell to 6th."
"It is shocking. I feel like any idiot would just do this:  leave: K.Johnson, Draymond, Grant  pickup: Trae, Zion, Bridges  There's a reason all our real best players are sitting at home. They already won gold medals when they were young and passionate about facing a new challenge. Anthony Davis played team USA ball before his first NBA game. Instead we have Trae and Zion, the future faces of American basketball, sitting at home.   Not to mention JaVale lmao.  Timelord? Montrezl? Plumlee? Jarrett Allen? Nerlens Noel? Christian Wood? Richaun Holmes?"
"Imagine if he turns out like Nerlens Noel or let us say, a Darko Milicic."
This is nerlens noel all over again
"This reminds me of when the Sixers had young assets and fans talked about trading guys like Nerlens Noel and Nick Stauskus for stars.  Your expectations are extremely divorced from reality.  I‚Äôd be very surprised if the Warriors can trade for a star player with Wiseman as the centerpiece, unless a Nets-level haul of picks is included.  You aren‚Äôt getting shit for fucking Jordan Poole"
"No way are they giving up 4OA + OG Anunoby for 2 years of Bradley Beal. Let's consider asset management: We have 4 more years of OG Anunoby at $18mil/yr and whoever we draft at 4OA will be locked up for 5 years at $7mil/yr.  That's $25 million for at least 4 years of OG + whoever we get at 4. Then we have Lowry, in all likelihood, coming off the books to provide about 20 million in cap space + whatever assets we recuperate in that.  So we're realistically looking at Suggs/Wiseman/Green, OG Anunoby, and a UFA: Oladipo, Porter Jr, Powell, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes, etc.  The roster would look like this: Suggs, FVV, GTJ, OG, Siakam, Holmes + whatever assets we get from Lowry.  Just doesn't make sense to give up *both* the 4OA pick and OG. Probably send a guard back."
Yeah that draft class was a cheese mine. The projected #1 was supposed to be Nerlens Noel.
"Another center would be nice as well, even a limited big body like Nerlens Noel."
that would‚Äôve been fun  plus the name ‚ÄúNerlens Noel‚Äù fits New Orleans like a glove lmao  he might sign with them this offseason if they don‚Äôt keep steven adams‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs an incredible defender
"Right? Like when I see OJ Mayo from multiple people...  Most players are out in the league for their first contract, someone is not a bust for just not making an All Star.  Is Nerlens Noel a bust? He has put together a solid role but it took awhile  Howabout someone like Jahlil Okafor, who is pretty typical of a lot of of the people we see on this list, offensive topside but inability to adjust to the higher level game defensively."
Lol there was ZERO reason to pick him number one. You‚Äôll get less flack picking an injured Nerlens Noel in that draft. If you‚Äôre gonna reach hard for someone might as well go boom or bust with Giannis who was actually the rawest high potential draft pick at that time.
"The Blazers problem is not offense it is defense.   They are the worst defensive team I have ever seen.   This is a coaching and personnel issue.   Hopefully Billups who came from Piston D 2004 title can see this aspect.   Go sign FA Nerlens Noel and trade CJ for a perimeter defenders.   They need to do something EXTREME.   CJ to the 76ers for Thybulle and Danny Green.   Sounds crazy? Nope. They need the defense that badly.   Dame, Green, Powell, Roco, Noel, Thybulle \[6th man\]   Now THAT is a defensive minded team with some shooters too."
what even made the cavs consider him? i thought nerlens noel or ben mclemore would‚Äôve gone #1. i didn‚Äôt even know who he was until they took him
He was considered a decent post defender and roatation center for a few years. Probably no worse a career than Nerlens Noel all things considered.
&gt;  Who should we have taken? Nerlens Noel? Oladipo?   Yes?
"That was honestly one of the worst draft classes of all time. Yeah Giannis went 15 and gobert at 27, but they were never considered a top ten pick.  As a Cavs fan I'm not even mad when I think back on it. Who should we have taken? Nerlens Noel? Oladipo? There was no right answer that year."
"[Looks like](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/5/22/4355884/nba-mock-draft-2013-nerlens-noel-cavaliers) he was pretty widely considered a top 5 guy at the time, but pretty much everyone thought Nerlens was going number 1."
"The trade they did was Jrue for Nerlens Noel. They had zero clue they would end up with Embiid or Simmons. ""Trust the Process"" to me has always been a way for sixers management to sell false hope to fans and 8 years later we can look at them and say they were terrible for a few years and now have assets with nothing of note to show for it."
The Nerlens Noel special
"It would probably never happen but:   Ayton and 2 picks for Dame.    Then double sign and trade CP3 to the Knicks for Nerlens Noel.   Dame, Booker, Bridges, Crowder, Noel \[starters\]  Payne, Craig, Cam Johnson, Saric, Kaminsky \[same bench\]   Noel &gt; Ayton for DEFENSE which is what cost the Suns in this series.   Dame &gt; CP3"
"They **absolutely** need to re-sign Chris Paul. By any means necessary. They 180 he helped pull for this franchise is amazing. Best road team. Best record vs winning teams. Plus 14 postseason wins after the city had a 10-year absence. He's the straw to stir the drink until Booker get the team involved and organized the way Chris does -- on *and* off the court.  And then they need to get a reserve big. Maybe a Daniel Theis or Nerlens Noel type. Or PJ Tucker. Heck, anybody who can get this team to not lose the dang title due its lack of defensive rebounding."
