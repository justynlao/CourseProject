"It's all tied into expectations. When a player first arrives, it's a surprise. It's celebrated, just a great time for everyone. But after a certain point, these performances are expected, so the excitement goes away. Then it becomes a question of, well, why is remaining stagnant? Teams beginning scouting his flaws so things aren't as easy anymore, and if you don't keep up a certain level of play, you will be shit on. No matter how great of a story you were, once those expectations come, nothing else matters.   Seen it firsthand with Pascal Siakam. Honestly looking up his story, I'm not sure how any reasonable person can seriously shit on him. But none of that matters anymore because he's expected to be an all-star caliber player."

"Pascal Siakam is a better player than Christian Wood. Wood is a better volume scorer and Siakam is playing a role he can’t play, so Wood has been better than Siakam this season, and I would even say for a good portion of last season. But put Siakam in a position like his 2018-19 role as an elite switching lockdown defender with 17 super efficient points, deadly scoring on fast breaks making up a large amount of his offense, and a teammate with the bulk of the load, and it’s not even close."

"The Raptors. They're pathetic on multiple levels and will be even worse when Kyle Lowry leaves, after which their ""core"" will be led by Pascal ""Andrew Wiggins 2.0"" Siakam. Every game Lowry plays for the Raptors is a waste of his talent, as was most of Kawhi Leonard’s tenure there. It's actually sickening how inept and incompetent they are year after year. Five more years of shittery and they should honestly be dissolved and a lottery held to determine where their players will play, leaving only a void of patheticity and depression where once an abominable NBA franchise existed."

*Siakam clearly flops*  Raptors announcers: JESUS FOX TRIED TO KILL PASCAL
"I'd say Jokic is a better passer which is huge praise in itself. He's the only player in the world that has no discernable flaw on offense, other than LeBron, and he does it as a 5 which creates a matchup nightmare for every team in the league. The best player he's ever played with is a borderline all star and he led a 3-1 comeback against arguably a title favourite. Give Jokic a Pascal Siakam or Bradley Beal type player and he could average a triple double on a championship team. LeBron is top 3 at the absolute worst all time but in 2021 Big Honey has it all.  As for Giannis, he reminds me a lot of young LeBron. If you can't knock down your free throws and if you can't score at 3 levels, you can't be the best player in the world.  I think that LeBron, Jokic, Kevin Durant, AD Kawhi Leonard and Steph Curry have an argument for being the best player in the world. Doncic is knocking on the door. Everyone else either has a major flaw (Giannis, Harden) or is just not as good as someone else who does the same thing (Lillard [Curry] , Embiid [AD] )."

guys did you know that Pascal Siakam spins????? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 BEYBLADE P LOLOLOL
"Exactly. Siakam hasn't looked like trash but he isn't really the same offensive talent that he was at the start of last season. I wonder why, Pascal looked really good for you guys as a first scoring option expanding his offensive game and then his shot just stopped falling."
Pascal Siakam. It seemed like he would enter the season trying to redeem himself. He again isn't playing like a first option.

"I think Pascal is a good player, but that hype of him being superstar is waning. FVV is useful player any good team would want, but with that rate on this team currently is not valuable to the team. FO trying to find next unknown Siakam, FVV, and Lowry. Those players need to play in meaningful to develop those skills, but those prospect will need to earn their time over the vets. It is a tricky situation right now for Raptors, but as long Nick Nurse is there with autonomy to coach the players in his perspective the Raptors will be fine."
"I tried using the Raptor metric and I got OG  Anunoby, Aron Baynes, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, and Fred VanVleet  Maybe I’m doing something wrong."

"Well those proposed mock trades were....interesting.   The proposed trades of Ayton for  Embiid (with additions thrown in),  Beal,  Towns,  Pascal Siakam,   And.... Miles Turner.  I think some of these trade COULD work theoretically, but would be almost impossible to actually find a trade that could even be close to working in reality."
Bam is becoming who Pascal Siakam is supposed to be.
"PG: 2018 Harden SG: Bradley Beal SF: 2008 Shane Battier PF: Pascal Siakam C: 2011-12 Tyson Chandler  Bench: Terry Rozier, 2013 Korver, Steven Adams  Harden and Beal can both play with or without the ball, score a ton, and run PnR with DPOY Chandler. Battier’s a great 3 and D wing, and Siakam fits well as the 3rd scoring option. Off the bench, Rozier is the 6th man, Korver adds another shooter, and Adams provides extra size/defense."
"This has been debated and written about ad nauseam. Although writing primarily about soccer, Chris Anderson and David Sally make [a pretty good case that basketball is a strong link game](https://www.amazon.ca/Numbers-Game-Everything-About-Soccer/dp/0143124560). IE: You're better off focusing on high-end talent than depth. Studies show that if you want to win basketball games, you should upgrade the top 1/2 talents on your team. With improved depth, your team obviously improves, and no one would debate that. [But compared to improving your strong links, improving your weak links just marginally increases your wins.](https://www.danielforsyth.me/is-basketball-a-weakest-link-sport/)  Are the Lakers winning last season with Gordon Hayward and Pascal Siakam in their 3 and 4 spot? Hell no."
"Should get in over Randle: Tatum, Giannis, KD  Similar tier: Jaylen Brown, Middleton, Sabonis+ Bam (if they're not  centers)  Randle currently outperforming: Tobias Harris, Pascal Siakam, Jimmy Butler  I think he should make it if he can keep near his current level of play.  IMO the knicks have shit tier point guards and spacing and his numbers don't even do justice to his full impact.  I'm not a big believer in players earning all-star nods because of past achievements, he's been really good and deserves the nod imo."

Pascal Siakam doesn't play basketball under control
Why does the thumbnail (on mobile) show Pascal Siakam for this game? Lol
"Incorrect. Korver missed 2 games but Teague, Horford, and Milsap played every game in the ECF.  Moreover, you can make hypothetical superteams with 3 all-stars that people wouldn't consider favorites or even contenders. For example a team with Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, and Kemba Walker."
"Number 1 worst is Al Horford, and it's not close. Pascal Siakam and Wiggins are also worse contracts. Kemba is still an all-star level guard"
Def Pascal Siakam is up there
Pascal Siakam shouldn’t have ever been paid the max. He a good player but he’s not a max quality player and it’s obvious when watching him play. His defense has fallen off hard this season.
Pascal Siakam
Would you trade pascal Siakam for John Collins(for the sake of this let’s say you could swap them 1 for 1 even though salary rules wouldn’t allow it)  If you really want to go bold what about Jerami Grant
"There is a 100% chance a team would have given Siakam a max offer sheet in last season’s RFA, and Toronto would have had to match anyways.  The only way you get out of that contract is if decide to let Pascal walk altogether."
Pascal Siakam is literally not even good anymore
"I saw a ""who is better: Pascal Siakam or Julius Randle?"" Post on here like three days ago.  You're comparing a guy on one of the worst teams of the decade to the guy who hit the championship-clinching shot over Draymond Green in the 2019 Finals but sure okay."

"&gt; He can't do that in this Sixers team because Embiid is a better inside scorer than Simmons and a better FT shooter.   It's not like we haven't seen Ben Simmons on the floor without Embiid. He still doesn't look like someone who can lead an offense.             &gt; In his own team with an actual playmaker, Simmons becomes a Giannis lite guy. He should not be the primary playmaker in any team, just like Giannis.     So, Ben is a much worse scorer than Giannis, and also has the same playmaking issue that Giannis has, AND also is a much worse shooter. Given that even Giannis himself struggles in the postseason, how much faith do you have in Ben Simmons not having that problem?           Ben is best suited for a Pascal Siakam/Bam Adebayo role, in which he is not the primary scorer or primary playmaker."
"Sure, but If you put any of those guys next to Kawhi Leonard and Pascal Siakam and they are going up against an injured Warriors team, they likely win a title too. Lowry winning a title as a 2nd or 3rd option moves the needle a bit, but it shouldn't make up for his only 1 all NBA selection, and 0 all defense selections.   If Kawhi doesn't go to Toronto, Lowry likely ends up with no championship. That being said, I'm pretty sure he'll get into the HOF because they have the lowest entry bar out of any of the major 5 sports' halls."
You cant say that! This isnt a Pascal Siakam ~~slander~~ thread
"If it wasn't for that mental block when it comes to shooting then Ben would be a better player. If it keeps up, he's going to be overpaid before his contract is over. People wanna talk shit about Pascal Siakam and I get it, but at least he's evolved his game since getting into the league. Ben is starting to regress this season offensively and it's a shame because it starts to negate his fantastic defence/playmaking abilities."

(Called a generational talent)  Pascal Siakam through 9 games this season: 20.4/8.8/5.1 (After a super rough start, clowned for being one of the worst players in the league by some on here.)  Siakam last 4 games: 23.6/9.6/6.2. He is just over two years older than Simmons."

did you just compare Ralph Sampson to Pascal Siakam?
"He made All-NBA once and finished 10th in MVP that year. It would the equivalent of making a list like this: LeBron, Steph, KD, Harden, Kawhi, and Pascal Siakam. Because guess who else finished 10th in MVP and made All-NBA second team?"
"Ben Simmons: #1 pick, 2016  Pascal Siakam: #27 pick, 2016"

"&gt;I think Pascal Siakam is a very very good player. I also don't think he's ever going to be the star people have him pegged as.   Just remember he was the 27th pick of the 2016 Draft. I've watched his whole career, and in 16-17 I would've been glad he just became a serviceable PF.   He reminds me of DeMar a lot, where DeMar struggled with being ""The Guy"" after his breakout season. Pascal is making big improvements on what to do when doubled/Tripled the same way DeMar did."
"We just dont have enough guys that can play winning basketball and those that can, have started slow. Like this is our Championship rotation players:  Kyle Lowry - Still plays at a high level  Danny Green - Went to LA  Kawhi Leonard - Went to LA  Pascal Siakam - Plays at a high level. Had a slow start and has picked it back up, but his regression is completely exaggerated because of the bubble.   Marc Gasol - Went to LA  Fred VanVleet - Still plays at a high level but is sometimes inconsistent in scoring due to his size.  Norman Powell - Has looked like a shell of himself so far and his BBIQ looks like GoDaddy curse Norm from [year 3](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/powelno01.html).  OG Anunoby - His defense is good, but his shot has been off so far. We were hoping he would take a leap in the scoring department after the bubble, but he still can't create buckets for himself.  Serge Ibaka - Went to LA  So last season, we lost Kawhi and Danny but we were still able to compete at a high level because we had 7 solid players. Our depth wasnt the best which is why Nurse would heavily rely on the likes of our 7 Championship vets. [Look at the MPG for the playoffs last season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2020.html)  While we played well, our two biggest weaknesses were rebounding and halfcourt offense, none of which were addressed in the offseason.  We also lost Gasol and Ibaka, who while looked like they were past their primes, provided solid defense at the rim and good offense. Marc couldnt score, but his passing was phenomenal, and Ibaka was able to get buckets consistently from midrange and 3. They both also brought a veteran poise and IQ to the team.  They were replaced with Alex Len and Aron Baynes. Baynes has struggling on offense, he cant even make open layups, and Alex Len, is a bonafide scrub.  So our bench mob became our starters and our bench is thin and full of gleaguers. Terrence Davis hasnt played much and is struggling a bit. Boucher has been great but he lack size.  So were a small team and a lot of our talent has been stripped. Our key vets have had some off games early and that can be attributed to getting adjusted with a new team as well as offcourt things like having to be in Tampa and essentially every game being a road one."
"I think what matters more now is that narrative shifts from pascal being the problem (now don’t get me wrong, he was shit and absolutely was A problem) and moreso the terrible roster construction.   Siakam was (deservedly) getting slander for the Raptors terrible start but even from game 1 he has not been the teams biggest problem."
"I think Pascal Siakam is a very very good player. I also don't think he's ever going to be the star people have him pegged as. I think he will vacillate up and down, make a few all star teams, make some all-nba teams, but people will still think he didn't live up to his potential."
No1 is faulting pascal iso. But his spin move was the most unnecessary move when wiggins is not right up into him. Draymond blew up the play for Fred to get the ball and position himself perfectly to help on siakam drive. It's on pascal to have the IQ to just shoot it when wiggins is that far back. Pascal already caught wiggins hesitating with the first move.
"I've been pushing #spin4cade really hard  Our #1 option, Pascal siakam, has this spin move which used to be really effective but now teams have figured it out, so he has almost nothing else to try.  Tonight he did a 360 spin for no reason for the final game winning shot  So yeah... #spin4cade  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kuut0w/highlight_siakam_drives_and_spins_into_the_jumper/"

He’s in a better team now. Imagine being on a team that is giving a max contract to Pascal Siakam?
"&gt; Pascal Siakam almost averaged 24 last year  Siakam averages 22.9 and it's ""almost 24"". Curry averages 23.8 and it's ""22."" Ok, man. Also, [scoring is up significantly since 2015.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html)"
Pascal Siakam almost averaged 24 last year. It's not an impressive number. Look at hardens numbers that year.
"I admit I haven't watched Hayward play that much, but his assist numbers don't really stand out to me. 5.2/game was his peak, in 2014. 4.1/game his best season in Boston. That's fewer than Pascal Siakam averages this year, and I definitely wouldn't call him ""one of the league's top playmakers""."
I think it was a Siakam vs Pascal joke
"Pascal Siakam, obviously."
"add in the details part too. the 2nd pick is protected and likely just 2nds but this is pretty realistic imo   The details: In an Eastern Conference race that is wide open, the 76ers could desperately use another dynamic two-way player. Bringing Lowry, a North Philadelphia native, back home could be the difference-making move that results in the 76ers' return to the NBA Finals for the first time in 20 years.  Yes, Lowry, a pending free agent, is going to turn 35 the day of the NBA trade deadline. And yes, giving up multiple first-round picks and a young player in Maxey would be difficult.  But it's a move Philadelphia should make. The 76ers add a proven playoff performer who would give coach Doc Rivers flexibility in how he deploys Ben Simmons. With Lowry's Bird rights, the Sixers could either extend him before the season ends or re-sign him this summer.  For other contenders, like the LA Clippers, the difficulty in trading for Lowry comes with both making the cap math work (Lowry makes $30.5 million this season) and giving Toronto something it needs in return. This trade accomplishes both.  Maxey and the picks will help Toronto add to its core of Fred VanVleet, Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby moving forward. Green, Scott and Ferguson all have expiring deals that can be rerouted to Cleveland so the Raptors can add Drummond, shoring up their center position without taking on long-term money.  The Cavaliers would recoup the second-round pick they gave up to acquire Drummond last season.  -- Tim Bontemps"
The Siakam vs Tatum arguments been beat to death but what about Pascal vs Tatum?
"LOL. Shaq is just entertainment. I mean Pascal Siakam has been in the league awhile now and contributed heavily to winning a championship just 2 seasons ago. Shaq didn't even know his first name was Pascal LOL. That's probably fine for a casual observer but when your job is an NBA analyst, it might help to know the names of the better players in the league."
You talkin' about Pascal when I'm talkin' about Siakam
"The guy who thought NBA champion, all star, 2nd team all NBA and most improved player award winner Pascal and Siakam were two different people? Ya don’t say!"
"That's a joke of a call. Reminds me of when Pascal Siakam got a flagrant for [intentionally tripping Embiid](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/05/03/raptors-pascal-siakam-flagrant-foul-tripping-sixers-joel-embiid-video) two years ago. And if anything, Booker's foul here was more egregious since he used his hands. Makes no sense to call that a common foul."
Pascal and Siakam
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
Haven't you ever seen Pascal and Siakam dunk?
We're at a severe disadvantage without Pascal and Siakam
[Pascal Siakam had an inconclusive rapid test and is awaiting the result of a PCR test which couldn’t be obtained in time for game vs. Houston. If that is negative he could be availabe to play vs. Bulls on Sunday.](https://twitter.com/michaelgrange/status/1365461495455375363?s=21)
Ernie was like “you’re looking at Pascal?” To Shaq and Shaq said “no I’m looking at Siakam”
"They're missing Nick, they're missing Nurse, they're missing Pascal, they're missing Siakam. They're going to be leaning heavily on their three stars Fred, Van and Vleet"
"Damn, both Pascal *and* Siakam?"
"Ernie: ""So you like Pascal""  Shaq, deadass: ""No, Siakam."""
Pascal has been great since reducing his scoring load a little bit and making him more of a playmaker. I really miss the KD Siakam we had last year tho.
[Shaq thought that Pascal and Siakam were two different people.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKFC8O23fkg)
Siakam: Solid Pascal: Trash
He was trying to be like Pascal when he should been trying to be like Siakam
Pascal and Siakam
Tbf Pascal has been shit this season Siakam has been going off though
Pascal and siakam
To be fair siakam is a monster but pascal is a bitch.
Seeing Pascal Siakam on the RAPTOR list was pretty clutch
Shaq likes Siakam but hates Pascal.
Overrated: OG Anunoby  Underrated: Pascal Siakam  A year ago my answers to these questions would have been reversed.
maybe the vote got split between pascal and siakam.
"Last season, Giannis was the only absolute guarantee on most peoples' Frontcourt ballot. After that, there were 4 frontcourt locks to make the game: Embiid, Siakam, Butler, and Tatum. People generally picked from these 4. Last season, we were a Top 2-3 team in the league and Pascal had a scorching start to the year which set the narrative in the first half of the regular season. These contributed to him becoming one of the largest vote getters last season.  This season, there are more locks on peoples ballot. Giannis is still Giannis, Embiid is playing like an MVP, and KD coming back and locking down the last frontcourt spot on most peoples ballots did not help. Like if you look at the voting, almost everyone's votes are down since they are all centralized to those three players."
The voting was probably split between pascal and siakam.
"Bam ""Pascal ""Julius ""Beyblade"" Randle"" Siakam"" Adebayo"
I think we should get our version of those jerseys so Pascal can play as both himself and Siakam in one night
"Yep the guy who thought Pascal and Siakam were two different players certainly knows more than NBA coaches about the current state of the league.  Make all the arguments for Sabonis you want, but let’s not pretend that Shaq is an NBA oracle now"
You mean Pascal Siakam?........
1. Bam Adebayo   2. Christian Wood   3. Ben Simmons   4. Pascal Siakam   6. Jerami Grant
1. Ben Simmons 2. Bam Adebayo  3. Pascal Siakam 4. Jerami Grant  5. Christian Wood
"If you have NBA 2k21 sometimes Shaq is a guest commentator in the 1st half. They ask him who he thinks is underrated in the NBA and the first player he names is Sabonis, along with Brandon Ingram and Pascal Siakam"
"Three of the East starters from last year didn’t even make it this year. Pascal Siakam, Trae Young, and Kemba Walker."
"Kemba might be a better scorer, but in no way is his starting point higher than Conley or Lowry, Especially Lowry.   We saw the difference in quality between Lowry and Kemba last year in the playoffs. Lowry almost carried a severely underperforming all star in Pascal Siakam to the ECF. On the other hand, Kemba severely underperformed and Tatum and Smart had to overperform to win over the Raptors.  Conley and Kemba are probably on the same level, but if I had to choose, I would always go with Conley because he just does a lot more"
"I’m considering how the players would fit together heavily. On a team with three  playmakers, Pascal would flourish. He did win a ring as the best second scorer after all. Plus, Siakam brings some needed defense for that lineup considering Irving and Harden make up the backcourt."
Pascal Siakam type beat
"""Pascal and Siakam"" gives me nightmares of two of him out there."
"He would immediately earn minutes over Baynes assuming Baynes better on D, Boogie better on O - due to the fact that Boogie can space the floor for our slashers. Toronto's offence heavily relies on downhill drives (Lowry, FVV, Norm, Pascal and Siakam)  Surprisingly, Boogie has a positive defensive RAPTOR rating this year so he may not be a total negative on a Raptors squad. But to be fair, Toronto's ultra aggressive defensive schemes may be too much for any plodding big man.  I would welcome Boogie if he ever chose the Raps"
Kyle Lowry  Doug Christie  Vince Carter  Kawhi Leonard  Pascal Siakam
The Raptors made a mistake keeping Pascal Siakam instead of Jakob Poeltl in the Kawhi trade.
Frank Nitilikina would blossom similarly to Pascal Siakam 💀 this was a little over a year ago that I made this gross take.
&gt; The Wizards traded Bradley Beal to the Raptors for Pascal Siakam.  😭
It’s Jordan “24/11 on his first start” McLaughlin and Pascal “inefficient volume scorer on a max” siakam we’re talking about actually. Soon to be Jordan “nba champion” McLaughlin and pascal “worst contract in the nba” siakam in 2-3 years too.
"In my house we call him Pascal ""can't make a layup in the last seconds to save his life"" Siakam. Its doesn't roll off the tongue but we like it."
"is that jordan ""5 ppg"" mclaughlin and pascal ""21 ppg"" siakam you're talking about?"
"It’s not really slander. I’m telling the truth. He underperforms in the biggest games, tier 1 players dominate in big games.  And winning a ring with KD and Kyrie as your teammates means a whole lot less than winning a ring with Kyle Lowry and pascal siakam. Or klay and dray. Or Kyrie and Kevin love."
"4 current raptors starters (Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, Norman Powell, and Chris Boucher) all played for the Raptors 905."
No he’s not Pascal is Siakam
"This exactly.  It's also not about Ibaka's skill, but the position and role he played for us. Pascal essentially had to readjust his playing style and that took some growing pains. He's used to playing light-PF/SF, run&amp;gun action, and essentially smaller. Knowing he can rely on Gasol/Ibaka to do the big men work.   Now that they've left, Pascal has to consciously hunt rebounds and be more aware of the play in the paint. His role now has to be bigger, both literally and figuratively. And he's doing a great job at it, but it took some soul searching to get there. It's not that Siakam doesn't have it in him, it's just that he never had to do it. We were blessed with 2 amazingly talented big men  EDIT: this also falls into why Siakam struggled agaisnt Boston in the bubble. Exact same reasons. The Raptors were forced to go small ball with either OG or Siakam at the 5. Once again, Siakam had to play as a big and he just wasn't ready for it.  I'm happy to see him finally adjust."
"183Pascal Siakam'20-'21+0.6-1.6-1.0 This is Pascals 538 RAPTOR defence rating..183rd in the ENTIRE league. If you check it out you will notice OG and FVV are both top 30...Pascal barely cracks top 100 on offence too. This isnt the only source for measuring a player sure but those are not ""all star #'s"", those are bad. He is like 125th in the league in WAR rating too(sucks). There are too many bad #'s to overlook. He simply isnt that great. Just a good player period."

What was it like 4 all in the 4th? One even pretty contested I think. Dude showed up when we needed it. Then he also had a nice block in the 4th too I think. That might have been Pascal or Siakam tho
"There's actually quite a bit in this January Ringer piece that wound up happening.   'The Raptors Have Lost Their Swagger. Can They Get It Back?' - The Ringer, Jan 5.  ""Nurse has to try something different. Going small won’t fix all their problems, but it looks like the best idea in a bad set of options. Defenses have changed how they guard [Siakam] from last season. He no longer has the same matchup advantages, or the offensive structure that allowed him to thrive. Toronto needs to force the issue by downsizing and making defenses adjust to them.""   https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/5/22214917/toronto-raptors-pascal-siakam-struggles"
Pascal just hates Florida. Siakam does too.
PASCAL SIAKAM SHOULD BE AN ALL STAR  WE HAVE A BETTER RECORD THAN THE CELTICS BUT THE HATERS DONT WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT
You see what those asshats were saying to Pascal Siakam? My god man the overt racism was mind-blowing.
"Pascal Siakam was 2nd Team All NBA last year, and was a PF too. Was he a Top 10 player last year? Or in general?"
This sub circlejerks inside the NBA as “the best show on TV” when something funny happens but when Shaq does something wrong everyone acts like the show sucks   Literally who cares if he didn’t know Pascal Siakams first name? Everyone calls him Siakam...
"Pascal not siakam, idiot.   /s"
Nobody closes out better on 3 point shooters in the nba than pascal Siakam
Pascal looks good. Siakam really must be looking out
I cannot believe Shaq didn't play off not knowing that Pascal and Siakam were the same person as a joke.
Jaden mcdaniels is the better version of pascal siakam
I seriously don't think its asking for too much from them to not think Pascal and Siakam are different people. The first act at your local comedy club on a rainy Tuesday night knows more about the subject matter they make jokes about than these guys it seems.
"I’m sure Shaq knew Pascal and Siakam are the same person lol, probably just caught off guard/associates with Siakam more than Pascal."
"Yeah, or even their own NBATV broadcasts. They're painful to listen to. I get that younger fans have their heros, but that doesn't mean Shaq has to like them or Chuck know who they are. Are you watching the TNT broadcast to hear them like your player as much as you, or be entertained?   Personally, I don't think Shaq does care because he doesn't view the players are playing a remotely similar game, except the lines, the hoops, and the rock. I bet his views aren't dissimilar from other players of his era. Shaq's opinion shouldn't make a bit of difference to why you like Gobert, Pascal, or Siakam. It also doesn't make a difference to the league, stars will be stars with or without color or play by play  So watch the game, enjoy your guys and that's that."
"i realized i made a conscious decision not to watch the pascal/siakam clip because i would legitimately feel cringe and I just didnt want to feel that, so i haven't"
Dame  Jaylen Brown  Bogdan Bogdanovic (definitely butchered his name) OG Anunoby or Pascal Siakam  Steven Adams
"You're getting downvoted, and I can't tell you why. You make a great point. They can easily get sidetracked and as entertaining as it may be, that's not completely why I'm here.  I'm here for the humour and jokes, but I'm also here for their bball insight. I was looking forward to hearing them talking about the Raptors during halftime, as they played a really good 1st half. Instead, they spent most of the segment roasting Shaq about the ""Pascal and Siakam"" comment. Which was funny, but kinda shitty because I just wanted some Raptors analysis from them.   Raptors havent been the best this season, and US media barely spoke about them when they were amazing. So the 1 time we're on TNT and they ignore them.. Safe to say that I was hella disappointed with the product."
"friendship ended with pascal, now siakam is my best friend"
Siakam was an allstar starter last year and won a title as the second best player on the team 2 years ago. wtf has Pascal done
"You are absolutely right, Siakam is just as if not more important than Pascal for the Raptors and Norm's success on the court. When we speak on Pascal we must remember Siakam, and vice versa."
Don't forget when playing alongside the Siakam's as well. Although I think he has better synergy with Pascal than Siakam.
"i imagine Pascal &amp; Siakam are like Mortal Kombats NOOB SAIBOT, just clones who act as one"
"Hannah Montana / Miley Cyrus vibes..  let’s be real, have any of us ever *actually* seen Pascal AND Siakam in the same room together???"
All I’m saying is have you ever seen Pascal and Siakam in the same room at the same time?
has anyone else noticed you never see Pascal and Siakam in the same room together? Curious.
"The amount of disrespect Shaq continues to show current NBA players is honestly getting old. Sure, it’s funny to watch the other guys roast him for being an idiot, but when Ernie tells him that Pascal and Siakam are the same person and he just shrugs and says “I don’t know his first name,” I mean dude you’re getting paid to talk about the NBA and you can’t be bothered to learn the names of the players you’re talking about? It’s one thing to say dumb shit that can be disputed from a basketball perspective, but when your whole media identity is being disrespectful to the current generation of players, openly disregarding their names, and continually undermining their accomplishments because you’re so worried about your own legacy, all you’re doing is tarnishing that very legacy.   Sorry for the rant. I’m just sick of this disrespectful attitude from Shaq."
The dude made an All-NBA team last year and you don’t even know his first name? So much disrespect towards both Pascal Siakam and towards basketball in general
Have you ever seen Siakam and Pascal in the same room
1. Hakeem Olajuwon  2. Steve Nash  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. Dikembe Mutumbo  5. Serge Ibaka  6. Victor Oladipo  7. Manute Bol  8. Luol Deng  9. Pascal Siakam  10. Joe
"I'm a casual fan who doesn't watch games anymore, barely looks at box scores but peaks in here and there but would say I know basketball. I'd never not know who Pascal Siakam is.  He fucking talks it every night. Dude should straight up not be on a basketball talk show. He's a clown and a bully."
Pascal and Siakam both had good games last night. With Milwaukee and Boston playing how they are playing the Raptors can still salvage this season especially if they can get something in return for Lowry. They have the best record in the East over the last 10 games
"I don’t follow any NBA at all, I just watched the finals last year because I lived in Toronto; even I know Pascal Siakam.   Does this make me an analyst or some shit?"
Pascal is better at scoring. Siakam is better at everything else.
"Pascal Siakam, your favourite player"
I wanna watch the warriors Vs raptors. When siakam guards Pascal. MINDFUCK!
"Wow, Pascal and Siakam got 27 points."
Whenever Pascal has a bad game we can just blame it on Siakam
pascal and siakam both did very well tonight
"Dlo, Ant, Pascal Siakam and KAT is a great group but what do they give to get"
     📂 Documents       L        📂 NBA         L           📂 Greatest duo of all time            L              🌶️Pascal Siakam and 🦆Chris Boucher
I wish pascal would take more mid range shots. How many times do you see the defender cheat because he knows Siakam is going to drive leaving Siakam with a ton of room
"kawhi leonard, kyle lowry and pascal siakam were all playing through injuries that would have kept them out of regular season games"
"If we falls ass backwards into the number 1 pick again and blow it on Pascal Siakam, idk man... lol"
Yeah I'd rather try to swing for Pascal Siakam who fixes a lot of our problems and is a known playoff performer.
You should hear Pascal Siakam and Chris Boucher

He subbed in Pascal for Siakam. And no one noticed.
"Finally, we have someone else who can take that shot in crunch time instead of Pascal and Siakam lol"
They’re actually born in the same year. Siakam just turned 27 a couple days ago and Randle will be in November but yeah the age thing comes from Siakam entering the league when he was 22 as opposed to Randle coming in when he was 19 I believe.   But going forward I’ll take Pascal mostly for his defensive advantages and playoff/championship experience. He’s having a down year shooting the ball which opens up the argument for Randle but if that 3-ball comes back to around 36% then it’s not much of an argument imo.

“Pascal and Siakam” - Shaq
He’s not worth a higher salary than Pascal Siakam
"&gt; Not a single one of those guys averaged even 10 points a game their first years, and they all had awful efficiency.  Second-year stats below Domantas Sabonis 11.6 57%TS Jamal Murray 16.7 58% TS Jaylen Brown 14.5 58%TS Pascal Siakam 7.3 55% TS"
"Lol everyone in the 2016 draft class was a late bloomer -- think about the other good players from that draft:  * Domantas Sabonis * Jamal Murray * Jaylen Brown * Pascal Siakam  Not a single one of those guys averaged even 10 points a game their first years, and they all had awful efficiency.  The only players that were good right away from that draft were Brogdon and Simmons.  Growth just takes a lot of time for some players."
"Some guys are just born leaders, although they get even better if they train at it. If I was Ant I'd take leadership classes in the offseason, and come back even better on that.   It helps to be the best player on the team but you don't absolutely have to be if you're good enough. Kyle Lowry clearly was the leader of the Raptors over Siakam and Kawhi, despite arguably being worse than them both (arguably because lots of people seem to hate Pascal now)."

To not understand how badly the deck was already stacked against them and then to not understand its even stupider to act like Curry is a better foor OR ceiling raiser than Harden when we had literally 4x the talent beside him and still woulda lost if CP3 didnt get hurt is wild.  Is Pascal Siakam better than Curry because he beat Curry in the finals in this zero sum game?"
"Remove two of the top 3 players from any team along with important rotation players like Looney. And tell me. What team in the nba would stand a chance?   Seriously imagine if Kawhi, Lowry and Gasol went down. They would have a starting lineup of Vanfleet, Norman Powell, Danny Green, Pascal Siakam and Serge Ibaka. That team would get obliterated in a finals game.   Though i do agree that warriors roster construction wasn’t great especially when guys like Jeff Green or Luc Mbah amoute are signing for the vet minimum"
Happy birthday Pascal and Siakam... great win guys
"Warriors fans told me Wiggins is better than Pascal. Sure, but he ain't better than Siakam"
Pascal Siakam +48 and it’s not even the best bet rating in the team
"Draymond wasn’t guarding Pascal 1 on 1 for most of his points, and even then Draymond isn’t used to lockdown opposing players 1 on 1 like he’s Kawhi  That’s not how defense works. Siakam got so many good looks as the 3rd best player vs the most injured Finals team ever"
Pascal &amp; Siakam
I don't know if pascal fits that nicely with him... but I Think Siakam would be a perfect pairing
"Big 4 with steph, curry, pascal, and siakam."
Already past Pascal to become my second favourite player behind Siakam
"All true, but we also have no real home court advantage, playing in Tampa and all.  Siakam is expected to do too much, with very little frontcourt help.  The muscle and timely scoring of Serge Ibaka is sorely missed, and I think it's impacted Pascal most of all.  Frustration is mounting on the team. The players aren't tanking though.  Still, we have champs like Fred, Pascal, and Kyle (OG and Boucher too, though they didn't contribute so much to our title) playing with some of the worst bench players in the entire NBA.    From day one, I knew that this year's Raps weren't going very far with such a lackluster roster, but I'm a little surprised that they've been so awful this whole month."
"Yeah this is what the people who root for a single player and go for team to team rooting for that individual's success are missing out on. The greatest joy from sports often come from the team building aspect.  Watching players you drafted and have only been a part of your franchise achieve winning a championship is honestly so special. I don't even care what people say about Kawhi, Siakam or Kyle Lowry or whatever in terms of legacies or being slandered or whatever. The joy in winning that ring is seeing guys like Pascal, Norm, OG, FVV who spent their entire career with the Raptors grow into being part of a championship team. The joy was seeing Kyle Lowry's name being chanted by the crowd when we made the finals.    None of these ""asterisk"" talk matter in that context LOL like I honestly don't even care. Fans can knock them out talking about all that stuff but none of it matters"
Iirc it's a reference to inside the nba when shaq named both pascal and siakam as good young players
"We’ll give you Pascal, but not Siakam."
"Kyle Lowry yelled, “You will always be a part of this history!"" OG Anunoby gave a look of pleasant surprise. Pascal Siakam belted, “We got a fucking tank squad now.” And before Norman Powell hit the locker room door, ex-teammate Fred Vanvleet hugged him &amp; said, “Thugs cry too. It’s cool, bro.”"

What does john wall have to do with pascal siakam...how you gonna talk trash about pascal when kembas contract even worse
Not strange just not dilusional. I do nt hate all the Raps btw. I actually think OG kicks ass and is a much better overall player than Siakam. He would put up way better stats than Siakam if he got the usage Pascal does.
"Not sure what the point is of your first comment. Are you being sarcastic because you think I'm lying about watching games (lol) or because you know you have no argument? As for your second inane comment, you're right it's not actually possible to be a good player on a bad team. Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam are terrible because the Raptors are only half a game up on Washington. Lavine is terrible for a similar reason, as are KAT, Shai, and Zion."
I am not actually. I just live in Canada and am force fed this Pascal hype. Also Tatum is shooting like 10% better from three and he takes much more difficult shots from everywhere on the court. His defence is noticably better than Siakams too. Face it ur boy simply isnt that great and never was (other than 20 games to start last season). If you think Siakam is close to Tatum you are either blind or not very basketball smart.
"Pascal Siakam is sooo overrated. Super inefficient and vastly overrated defensively. He was invisble again tonight except last 6 mins when Pistons were playing their bums/didnt care. He is Raps 4th best player making max contract. He never should have been All Nba 2nd team either. He had 20 fantastic games at beginning of the year and was very ordinary after that not to mention terrible against good defenders/teams. Receiving MVP votes too was absolutely ridiculous. He was not even the most valuable on his own team and is not even close this year (OG, Lowry, and arguably FVV are all more valuable to the team this year). The canadian media and announcers desperately try to hype him up non-stop."
"[Spears] Kyle Lowry yelled, “What the fuck!” OG gave a look of disappointment. Pascal Siakam belted, “We ain’t got a fucking squad now.” And before Fred VanVleet hit the locker room door, ex-Raptor coach Dwane Casey hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"There are a lot of problems with the NBA cap and salary rules.  The biggest IMO is the max salary rule.  There is no way a team should be able to afford Durant, Harden, and Kyrie Irving, but the max salary is artificially lower than market value for those guys.  Meanwhile, small market teams (or teams with a competitive disadvantage of being in another country like Toronto) have to give max contracts to lesser stars like Gordon Hayward, Harrison Barnes, Pascal Siakam, etc. in the hopes that they develop or play up to their contract.  Meanwhile large market teams get to compete for the real stars, and they have enough money to apparently sign 3-4 of them because the max contract is artificially low and the salary cap is flexible."

"Whatever the the narrative is on Pascal Siakam, nobody projected him to be half as good as he is."
"I have watched him a ton, I love watching the Sixers.  But let's be real. $180 million dollars. About $36 million a year for the next 4 years, peaking at $39 million in year 4. Pascal Siakam made all NBA, is 2 years younger, and is getting flamed for his contract (for good reason, although I have faith in him), even though it's roughly $50 million less than Tobi.   He's been a very good tertiary star that's getting paid like a number 1 option star. A rebuilding team selling off their star like Beal or Lavine would not be looking for a long term max level contract for someone who plays like a 3rd option on a contender. On top of that he's got a 5% or $5 million dollar trade kicker.  Make no mistake. If you do trade Harris you will have to pay a team to take him. People aren't paying $180 million dollars and a young star guard like Lavine or Beal for a 20 points per game regardless of how efficient they are.   Norm Powell has been just as efficient, is younger, and will probably make half as much money this offseason as Tobi. Let that sink in."
"This take will be trashed by the sub but I think you're right. He's the Jazz' best player still. And even though his offense is very limited the Jazz are much better with him on the floor on both ends. Gobert's on/off per 100 paint the picture that he's very good for Utah's team offense, even though he's quite limited individually. And well defensively his value should be obvious. I think he at least deserves a spot between 6-10 on the KIA MVP ladder. When I wrote my comment regarding this a couple of days ago I checked other players in the past 10 years ranking between 7th and 10th and the list is the following:  &gt;Guys that placed somewhere between 7 and 10 in the past were Pascal Siakam, Lamarcus Aldridge, Demar Derozan, John Wall, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Al Jefferson, Tony Parker, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Love.  And among those players I believe Gobert is one of the very best."
IS he as unclutch as pascal siakam?
No one has ever seen Pascal Siakam and Jarred Vanderbilt in the same room.
No one has seen Jarred Vanderbilt and Pascal Siakam in the same room.
"Nowhere does Ibaka say he wasn't a leader.  Norm Powell praised Leonard for his ability to relax his teammates:  “The one thing Kawhi really stressed to us was just to enjoy it. Don’t get too out of character, just enjoy the moment and continue to go out there and just lay it on the floor. So it was an amazing feeling just to be able to battle and chip away at it.”  Pascal Siakam echoed Powell’s words: “He’s always been that guy who you can look at when something goes bad. He just has that calm demeanor. It gives you that peace, knowing that everything is going to be OK. And I feel like that every time I’m on the floor with him.”  If you want more, let me know."
"uhhh...  Damon Stoudemire/Vince Carter/Tracy McGrady/Chris Bosh/Marcus Camby  I would have DeMar over Damon, but the positions don't really match.  Honourable Mentions: PJ Tucker, Jonas Valanciunas, Roy Hibbert (who we apparently traded to Indiana), OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, and Fred VanVleet (who doesn't count because he wasn't technically drafted, though we did sign him)  This is a relatively young team so there's not a whole lot of talent to choose from, especially at point guard."
Pascal Siakam
the opposite of pascal siakam.
"This was basically Pascal Siakam in his first few years in the league, he had zero basketball skills but his motor was unmatched.  He still hustles a ton, but he can actually play basketball now so he doesn't need to."
He had a couple of nice games last season so I drank the kool aid and thought he would be the next pascal siakam lol
"Siakam can be in this too. Both growing up in Cameroon, Pascal almost became a priest to winning the championship. Lots of great story lines"
"I'd like my comedic relief to actually involve some basketball, ya know? I'm not asking that they cite stats or do detailed game breakdowns, but they should know that Pascal and Siakam are not two different players. He was an All Star, All-NBA and an NBA Champion in the last two years, you can know his God damn name.  They should know when major free agents sign contracts, they should know that Mitchell Robinson's name isn't Stuart, they should know how a fucking pick'n'roll works in the modern NBA. They don't need to be smart, but if they could make it slightly less obvious that they don't give a flying fuck about the sport I'd appreciate it."
Then ask Shaq the differences between Pascal and Siakam
Pascal Siakam straight up
"Hey Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby feel free to come back ASAP thanks."
"I am on the opposite side lol, I am not sure about beating the Lakers but I think the Kawhi/Lowry Raptors can beat the Nets, the defensive personal that year was crazy and the Raps could play Gasol when the Nets are not going small and even when the Nets go small Toronto would have had a small ball defensive team.  And the funny thing is that while I am writing this I was concerned about if the Raptors offense can hold up I realized that for some reason I am forgetting Siakam who was scorrng well on the inside  against Draymond and GSW and imagine what he would do against the Nets defense. So the Lowry/FVV/Kawhi/Pascal/Ibaka would have been pretty fun to see in play against the current Nets team."
"At the moment, he's in between:  Khris Middleton  CJ McCollum  **WB**  SGA  Pascal Siakam"
Pascal Siakam
"Found 5  * Terrel Harris (2010 Rio Grande Valley Vipers, 2012 Heat) * Cory Joseph (2012 Austin Toros, 2014 Spurs) * James Michael McAdoo (2015 Santa Cruz Warriors, 2015 &amp; 2017 Warriors) * Pascal Siakam (2017 Raptors 905, 2019 Raptors) * Fred VanVleet (2017 Raptors 905, 2019 Raptors)"
I'm gonna say it  Pascal Siakam is better than Ben Simmons
Ya you used that money better on a guy like Pascal Siakam
Pascal Siakam came into the league and couldn’t throw a brick in the ocean. Then he had two 37% seasons from deep. Guys can learn how to shoot.
"You rep Pascal Siakam, a dude who has one move and can't shoot a lick"
"That's fair about the Middleton comparison, I just feel like Pippen was longer and more physically imposing than Jimmy (7'3"" wingspan vs. Jimmy's 6'8"").   As far as recent/current players go he's kind of like a better Pascal Siakam or Jerami Grant to me, more of a slasher than an iso scorer (which is what Jimmy has kind of molded his game into)."
Gonna yoink the Raps all-time starting five;  Kyle Lowry  Vince Carter  Kawhi Leonard  Pascal Siakam  Chris Bosh
Jonas “Big Science” Valanciunas  Kyle “The Bulldog” Lowry  DeMar “Deebo” Derozan or Comp10  PJ “The Lebron stopper” Tucker  Demarre “Junkyard Dog 2.0” Carroll  Pascal “ Spicy P” Siakam  Fred “VanFleek” Vanvleet   Malachi “Red Vanvleet” Flynn  Stormin Norman   CJ “Kilometres” Miles
"Kawhi has played on teams with Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, and Paul George.  Now we're expecting KD to prove he's a ""superstar"" by winning a series where his second best player is probably Joe Harris. This narrative is weird as fuck."
Our best player was Pascal Siakam and he went dead cold in the bubble. Celtics had the Js and Kemba and we literally had nobody who could function as a primary scoring option. It was a miracle taking the Celtics to 7
Pascal Siakam ended up with the nickname Spicy P mostly because he told his teammates he didn’t like the name so it stuck. For some reason the Raptors sub was trying to make “Icy V” a thing for Fred VanVleet which was an S tier horrible nick name
"I never said soley low picks. I said ""low picks and trades""  Did Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Serge Ibaka, Kyle Lowry, etc sign with the Toronto Raptors? They never did.  Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, and Fred VanVleet. All 3 of those guys were picked 27th, 46th, and last one was not even drafted.   The team never had a top/lottery pick drafted on their roster. They never signed a top guy in free agency. When Masai got there he didn't have a player who was considered anything but a maybe boderline all-star in Rudy Gay. That's it."
"You’re going to have to cite what you’re claiming. Nowhere have I seen that Kawhi wanted to sign with PG right off the bat and that he even talked to the Raptors about trading for PG.  This is all I’ve found:   &gt;	Bruce Arthur of the Toronto Star reported the Thunder ""asked for Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, and four unprotected first-round picks as a starting point for Paul George. The Raptors believed they were being used as leverage, and believed Kawhi finally, truly wanted LA. And then he left.""  Toronto was not trying to trade for PG, and Kawhi did not ask them to. Sam Presti was attempting to start a bidding war to get more from the Clippers. Source: https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2844408-woj-raptors-rejected-russell-westbrook-paul-george-for-pascal-siakam-trade.amp.html  I just gave you a source directly from Doc Rivers mouth that the timeline goes 1) the Clippers wanted to sign Kawhi, 2) Kawhi tells them they have to make roster changes for him to sign, 3) the Clips give him a list, 4) Kawhi chooses PG, 5) they trade for PG, and then 6) Kawhi signs. That *is* Kawhi forcing them to trade for PG. Forcing someone to do something can just mean to coerce them. It’s not necessarily through violent means."
"you guys are crazy, mpj is 6'10,22 and is crazy good from 3. not giving pascal siakam for a player like that would be idiotic no matter how you slice it"
You have your eyes on Pascal?  I got mine on Siakam.   /s*haq*
"Never underestimate Western Conference draft picks. It could turn out to be anyone, it could be someone as good as Pascal Siakam. I kid about the last part but the Wolves pick this season (top 3 if it doesn't convey to the Warriors), another first, McDaniels and salary filler is a good offer. You'd be commiting to tanking too which sucks of course. Wolves might think its an overpay on their side but they've got a promising young player already locked up if KAT leaves and they'd have an all NBA player tied up for 4 years. He's the type of missing piece they've needed since Jimmy left."
So you said 2019 in the previous comment and now you’re talking about 2020 but I’m the one who needs to get years right? Not to mention in 2020 both Pascal Siakam and Kyle Lowry made the all star game (Siakam as a starter too! He had a fantastic season).
"CJ and Dame can work out if the other players on the team are great defense player like Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green, and healthy Anthony Davis protect paint with help defense. They would also need a wings who can defend like Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Pascal Siakam, Mikal Bridges, and OG Anunoby."
"1. Ben Simmons - biggest difference maker in the draft. Compare his stats with Brown and you'll see that despite not shooting threes and being bad at free throws Ben has higher efg% and ts%. Better in every other element of the game too. Top 3 defender in the league behind Kawhi and Gobert. Great playmaker. Handles. Unselfish. It's ridiculous to me that this could be the minority opinion. Yeah, the team around him has to fit, but guess what? Every other team in the Association is learning they need to be able to go four out too. He'd have a ring by now if the Sixers hadn't gone with Colangelo. You build around a player like this.   2. Jaylen Brown - Also really damn good. Obviously things went rotten in Boston but this guy is like the textbook example of what you want your second best player to be, and if he was in a feature role in his own team built around him his game could blossom like Harden's did. That's not too say he could be as good as Harden, but I do think he does everything so well he'd really thrive.  3. Jamal Murray - basing this on where he was pre-injury, but when he's going he's unstoppable. Also a great teammate.  4. Domantas Sabonis - Needs a good coach and a team with a plan, hopefully that's Indiana. I'm worried he's going to look a lot worse without Turner (on offense!) because I don't think the Pacers consistently were able to consistently trot out 5 competent players at the same time last year. Dude is more fluid and creative than he gets credit for. I don't think he's that bad of a defender, either, just not a rim protector, but people act like he's Enes Kanter. He was the only thing holding Indiana together at times.  5. Pascal Siakam - Toronto was set up to fail this year obviously so I don't hold this season against him. He got a bit exposed though and looks like he's more Trevor Ariza than Kobe Bryant. He's a good second option but a great third option.  6. Brandon Ingram - I'm not an Ingram believer at all. Career 14.7 PER.  Not a great Rebound%. It's Zion's team and BI will probably be the guy they flip to get him help. When I hear about how good he is it's like NO fans have something to sell, like it's a long con to pump up his trade value. For some reason I think he'll end up in Sacramento as part of a package that nets Zion a running mate like Fox."
Damn this is actually pretty close between all these guys 5 years into their careers. They’re all  great in their own different ways so it’s tough to perfectly list them. I’d probably say something like:  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons   Jamal Murray  Pascal Siakam  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis   I’m mainly basing this off who I would want in the playoffs.
"Jaylen Brown - best 2 way  Jamal Murray - best offensively  Ben Simmons - best defensively   Brandon Ingram - solid 2way wing, still want more  Pascal Siakam - will need to prove he's up to his pre-ASB 2020 self to jump ahead  Domantas Sabonis - Worst defensively, very talented, but not sure if it drives winning"
1) Jamal Murray  2) Jaylen Brown  3) Ben Simmons  4) Pascal Siakam  5) Domantas Sabonis  5) Brandon Ingram
jamal murray -healthy that is  ben simmons  jaylen brown  domantas sabonis  brandon ingram  pascal siakam
Jaylen Brown: I’m a biased Celtics fan  Jamal Murray: established second star on an elite team  Brandon Ingram: already a second star to a rising Zion but has shown consistent improvement  Pascal Siakam: championship winning 3rd option that would be a beautiful fit on the Celtics according to this biased Celtics fan  Ben Simmons: above Sabonis because he is elite at everything except shooting  Sabonis: below Simmons because as good as he is on offense he can’t defend well enough to be a primary big
Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Domantas Sabonis  Jamal Murray  Brandon Ingram   Pascal Siakam
Domantas Sabonis  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Pascal Siakam  Brandon Ingram  Jamal Murray
1. Jaylen Brown 2. Ben Simmons 3. Jamal Murray 4. Domantas Sabonis  5. Brandon Ingram 6. Pascal Siakam
bi doesn't play defence though and you can't count on klay to be a good defender coming  off of his injuries. they should look into trading that package for pascal siakam imo.
"reminds me of the raptors vs 76ers in playoffs 2 years ago  Cool nugget from Raptors very international team. Serge Ibaka speaks french to Pascal Siakam, spanish to Marc Gasol &amp; english to the rest team. When Serge &amp; Gasol doubled Joel Embiid they would yell where to help from in Spanish so Joel (who speaks french) could not understand."
"Not a raptors fan either, and one of the only players I dislike as much as Simmons is Pascal Siakam."
Pascal Siakam being a better second option than Paul George is probably a cold take at this point
Pascal Siakam
"Of course Bridges is gonna be more efficient when he’s playing off CP3, Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton. OG playing off of Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet, has to create way more for himself."
"He doesn't have the skill. He is a stronger version of Pascal siakam. These guys are just athletic transition runners with a little touch around the rim. No ball handling skills, no shooting stroke, no instinct"
"CJ and a bunch of shit for Siakam isn't the worst trade I've ever seen on here. We'd likely lose Nas, Ant and draft equity to make it happen but I like Pascal a lot."
Pascal Siakam
Id like to see the players try and trade for Pascal Siakam and Resign Powell.  Dame -Powell-Covington-Siakam-Nurkic
"You can replace MJ with Scottie Pippen, Kobe with Derek Fisher, and Curry with Pascal Siakam and this list would still be true lol"
"Julius Randle and Pascal Siakam both got a lot of shit for how they performed in their previous playoff games.  For Randle it’s his first time being in the playoffs and it’s the first time being the guy. That’s a lot of pressure. With the effort he’s shown to become the MIP this year I’m positive he’ll be better next playoffs.  Same with Siakam, didn’t do so hot in the bubble and it was his first time also being the guy. He’s got plenty of time to improve and I’m sure he will too.  KAT and DLo. I think next year when that teams actually healthy they’ll be great. New coach and soon to be ownership, I think Minnesota will be dangerous soon"
"I believe Pascal Siakam is still a Top 30 player in the NBA, but COVID and poor roster construction made it impossible for him to showcase his improvement this season."
&gt; he’s not spicy enough for me  She needed some spicy p pascal siakam
"Clippers defense sucked ass and Luka regularly torched them. And no Paul George did not play like an All NBA player. Look at who made all NBA last year, the only one who pg13 is better than is Pascal siakam and that's because siakam regressed and his team didn't do as well this year. Paul George is more like Tobias Harris these days than first team all NBA Paul George, and honestly I think Tobias Harris might be better."
I know right; too bad we couldn't have Pascal Siakam at 34M/year
Every team has iffy contracts.   We have Kennard; ya'll have Pascal Siakam at 34M/year lmao
RIP Pascal Siakam and his 29% from three
That’s Pascal Siakam money^(it hurts so much)
he tricked y'all man starting lineup  Julius Randle  Pascal Siakam  Kristaps Porzingis  Jimmy Butler  Bam Adebayo
Pascal Siakam just bought his Mum a house.   Lovely moment as his Dad passed away and Pascal couldn’t attend the funeral as he was stuck waiting for his visa.   https://www.instagram.com/p/COrAK2RrA0h/?utm_medium=copy_link
Yeah considering we went to 7 games with Boston without Kawhi and Pascal Siakam straight up disappeared for most of that series so it was rough but with him around Pascal plays much better as the second go 2 scorer
"Khem Birch, Fred VanVleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam"
He aint giving Pascal Siakam credit.   Dray cant guard Pascal for some reason.
"Overrated is for your franchise player Pascal Siakam, not for someone like Curry."
"LeBron was better than Kawhi in 2018 and again in 2020, but in 2019 LeBron was hurt so he didn't play. That doesn't mean Kawhi was better, just that LeBron was out with an injury. Just like nobody would say that Pascal Siakam was a better basketball player than Kevin Durant, they would just say KD was hurt."
Disgusting Pascal Siakam aka African Beyblade erasure.
"He wants to play with players like Pascal, not Siakam"
"Yes because Randal wasn’t good until this year, obviously.  This whole discussion was on the ridiculousness of using Pascals ring as a reason why he’s better than Randal, when literally you could’ve put Julius Randle on that team and it’d be the same result lol. He was the third option and didn’t have the attention of the defense Because he was playing with a mega star and an allstar.   You’re a victim of recency bias. Pascal Siakam on the Knicks and they miss the playoffs or just make the play in"
"Siakam was the second option on the Raps, you can say Lowry was the better player but Pascal was the second option"
Pascal Siakam but in New York
Would you rather have Julius Randle or Pascal Siakam as your first option in the playoffs?
"I mean, you can be entertainment and also know basic information about the NBA. No one wants the Hollenger Podcast on TNT but like maybe they can know that Pascal and Siakam are in fact not two different players?"
"Do hear fans not want Jimmy long term? Seems like a good a choice as any to pair with another star and I don't see how Miami flips CJ for anybody worthwhile. They're a good team, no need to blow it up imo.  The raps, on the other hand, have a Pascal Siakam that fills a very similar role and only has 2 more years on his deal. Depending on how the draft goes, Raps may want to continue to reassemble and shed some salary. On the other hand, if we draft a stud then there's no way we want Ceej."
"You think so? I think that team is close, I think they got to trade away CJ. He's just not the right #2 for same. A Pascal Siakam or Jimmy Butler type #2 player is a lot better."
There being a large number of clowns (poorly managed teams) willing to pay $2000 dollars for a PS5 (Give Jimmy Butler/Pascal Siakam/ etc. the supermax) does not mean that someone isn't overpaying for their own PS5 when they drop the same amount of money.   I think its a perfectly apt comparison.
"&gt; Ben has had a very strange effect on us here, a large portion seem to be waiting for any opportunity to hate on him and relish it when they have an opportunity to scapegoat him.   Aw man, I've watched half the Raptors fanbase (plus this entire sub) do this with Pascal all year. Just so stupid its insane and exhausting.   People expect alot of these players to be something they are not, and sure in the case of Philly I'd say you guys need a better second scoring option than Tobias Harris, and in our case we need a better primary scoring option than Siakam. However both those issues with the team are not reasons to just dismiss two incredibly talented players, who while they may not be gods at every element of the game, are star caliber talents who you need to help the team win.   Fans just expect the wrong things, while not appreciating what they actually have."
More intense than the rivalry between Pascal and Siakam?
Good coaches build strategy around talent and if Pascal Siakam is your second best player I'm pretty sure Carlisle knows how to use him
You guys underestimate Pascal Siakam + the lottery pick they’ll get. Trust in Masai bro Raps winning a chip within the next 10 years
"I honestly don't understand why everyone is so obsessed with making literally anything about Julius Randle into a statement about fucking Pascal Siakam. No one's talking about your guy, relax. This is the pettiest, most cringe response possible"
Pascal Siakam: *Y’all gonna learn the hard way*
"Hes playing way worse than Siakam in the bubble. His offence is comparable to Siakam vs the celtics, but atleast Pascal was still playing elite defense"
"&gt; but Siakam is pretty bad in the playoffs too, not as bad as Randle but still not great.   Actually 2 years ago today Pascal Siakam dropped 32 points on 14/17 shooting in Game 1 of the NBA FINALS.   He also hit the championship clinching shot in Finals Game 6 and had 26 pts on 10/17 shooting.   Comparing a player who put up big numbers on a route to a championship vs someone struggling in a likely first round exit just doesn't make sense."
"Pascal was better last year in the regular season than Randle was this year and Pascal was better in the playoffs as well. I don't really care that randle got hot from 3 for one season, the jump from 28% to 41% is not sustainable and you're seeing it here. But all that really matters is how Randle comes back next season. Siakam came back as a much better playmaker and can handle double teams. You'll need randle to do the same because one dimensional jumpshooters are just too easy to guard."
"I mean Randall also averages twice as many assists and is just a more talented ISO player than Siakam. Stop letting 4 games change your entire opinion, you’re suffering from recency bias.   Randal and Siakam have similar FG% and FT%, but when Randall shoots a whopping 14% better from 3 than Pascal and averages double the amount of assists, it’s safe to say he’s the better offensive player. Jesus"
That’s NBA champion Pascal Siakam for you
Pascal Siakam vs Boston last season
Tobias Harris &gt; Pascal Siakam
"Lmao welcome to the pascal siakam experience, dudes been getting called beyblade for 2 years because he got injured and a freak pandemic happened resulting in 1 bad playoff series where they took it right down to the wire in 7 games, whereas the year before he was the #2 guy on a championship team.. he's not even a shit talker publicly.   Butlers whole shtick is ""muh work ethic, 1 am workout"" ""ill take care of the rest"" and the man just got outscored by bryn forbes, he's going to rightfully get shit on."
Lol Siakam better than this.  Pascal is a better comparison IMO.
Turns out Randle was simply Pascal Siakam the whole time
I would compare him to bubble Siakam but even Pascal played phenomenal defence and scored slightly better than this.
Julius Randle looking Pascal Siakam like in these playoffs
"Hey now, it's only been one down year. Let's not forget about the original Beyblade, Pascal Siakam."
Pascal Siakam: *First time?*
Welcome to the Pascal Siakam treatment
Pascal Siakam
Pascal siakam would be a perfect fit
He's worse equipped than Pascal but how about compared to Siakam?
Bam got the Siakam treatment. The scouting report on him is out in the playoffs and he's offensively even worse equipped to deal with it than Pascal.
"Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam and Paul George. These guys have all been All Stars and All NBA players. ""No stars"" 🙄"
That's nba champ pascal siakam to you
"Lowry is the GROAT but in that run specifically, Siakam was the 2nd option and had the better season.  He was all star starter and had a historic performance along side Kawhi. I can’t put Lowry over him for that run specifically given the performance we got from Pascal"
You seriously underrate how good pascal siakam was for the raptors championship run
"So you’re saying the Pascal Siakam who was an energy bench player didn’t play well against LeBron in his second season? Who would have guessed  I’m not saying the Raps definitely beat the Lakers but the injured Heat took them to 6. Siakam would have been so much better if the attention was on Kawhi instead of him. Raps easily get that series to 7, or win sooner."
"TIL Pascal Siakam is not only near PG's level, but better than PG, without having ever averaged 20ppg in the playoffs and having more than one spin move in his bag. LMFAOOOOOOO you can't make this shit up, some people are just this dumb."
"Lmfao cherrypicking games that mean nothing. As expected of low iq braindead fans. Unlike you I dont need to cherrypick Siakam's games over 5+ years of playoffs because hes only been slightly relevant for 2 years. I dont even need to cherrypick games like you since all his games in last year's run was dogshit.  Pascal Siakam 2020 playoffs - 17ppg, 39% FG, 29% 3p  \^\^Thats the guy you said you'd take over PG. Fucking casuals, giving me cancer reading their dumb shit."
PG: ‘17 Kyle Lowry  SG: ‘01 Vince Carter  SF: ‘19 Kawhi Leonard  PF: ‘20 Pascal Siakam  C: ‘10 Chris Bosh
Pascal “the Tasmanian Devil” Siakam
"If I was the Warriors, I would really look into trading Wiseman, their pick and the minny and perhaps Wiggins (or some combination of these assets) for someone that can help Steph win now.           They can definitely get Myles Turner or maybe even someone like Pascal Siakam if they are willing to part with some or all of those assets."
"Julius Randle has been a huge story the entire season. For me, it's pretty disappointing if the Knicks lose in the first round to the hawks. Furthermore, it's pretty easy to see the narrative turn on him if this happens too.  Pascal Siakam went from leading the #2 seed Raptors, getting his first all star appearance and all nba second team last season to being a joke. The tide can turn really quickly."
"For one season, out of seven. Or is Pascal Siakam a superstar right now"
"“It’s clear he's not a #1, but rather a better #2 similar to Pascal Siakam who needs a #1 option to thrive.“  this also assumes lebron now after one game isn’t a number 1 lmao"
"The Toronto team had Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet who are both just entering their prime, also OG Anunoby who couldn’t play in our Championship run due to injuries.              The Toronto team was not only a better team than these Clippers, they also had a lot more upcoming talent than these Clippers.               Kawhi left mostly because of his family. If he expected to be on a better team then he was straight up deluisonal."
"Instead of siakam a sign and trade for Lowry actually seems more reasonable. Steph can play shooting guard on offense and Lowry's shooting fits in much more with draymond considering Pascal and draymond can't play center in large doses.  Assuming Wiggins gets shipped out lineup would look like Lowry, Steph, Klay, draymond, some center"
Hard to decide between OG Anunoby at 23rd and Pascal Siakam at 27th. Hoping Flynn (29th) and Harris (59th) develop an argument for this one day as well.
Pascal siakam at 27th
1. Demar Derozan 2. Pascal Siakam 3. Kyle Lowry 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Steve Nash 6. Jamal Murray 7. RJ Barrett  8. Jeremy Lin 9. Norman Powell  10. Jayson Tatum
Pascal Siakam being an all-star last season
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"Pascal Siakam. A good coaching choice in Nick Nurse. Him getting Kawhi was more of a fluke then anything else. But still, he made the trade. I am sure the Raptors can find someone else that can do just as good of a job."
"Blow. It. Up. The Raptors are kind of in a weird spot. I don't see a realistic scenario where they can become a legit contender in the next few years. Lowry is 35 which doesn't making a dinosaur or anything but he's probably got only a few really productive years left. Pascal Siakam and Fred Van Vleet are both 27 years old. So you got one of your core players aging out soon and two that are just about to get into their primes.  You don't win an NBA championship without a Hall of Fame player. Even the Detroit Pistons, a team that gets talked about a lot as a championship team without a real star, has Hall of famer Ben Wallace. Although Dirk Nowitzki was a clear hall of famer by the time he won his championship nobody would have said that that team was loaded.   So how are the raptors going to get this Hall of Fame type player? It's highly unlikely that they're going to find one via trade like they did with Kawhi Leonard. That was a unique circumstance. I don't think anybody expects Siakam, Van Vleet, or OG Ananouby to become that type of player. You still have time to build something around these guys but at best it's a middling playoff team.   I know Masai has no desire to go through a full rebuild but I just don't see how can get around it at this point. He should see we can get for these younger guys except, Ananouby, let Lowry walk, and just tank for the next few years and hope you get lucky in the lottery."
"Right, it has nothing to do with giving Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet $230 million lol"
They passed on:  Jamal Murray  Buddy Hield  Pascal Siakam  Dejounte Murray  Sabonis
Imagine how much further raps could’ve gone if Pascal Siakam didn’t struggle in the bubble as much as he did too
"Curry is 66.5% TS on 34.9% usage. Beal is 59.3% TS on 34.1% usage.  To put that in perspective, that gap in TS% is the same as the gap between James Harden and Pascal Siakam.  Not trying to shit on Beal but they aren't close in terms of efficiency."
"**Most games as top scorer - best on team**  1. Stephen Curry - 52 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo - 50 3. Luka Doncic - 49  **Most games as top scorer - second best on team**  1.

Andre Drummond, Khris Middleton - 8  **Fewest games as top scorer - third best on team**  1. Rui Hachimura - 3 2. Carmelo Anthony, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Orlando Magic - 4"
I don’t think he’s shown much understanding of his personnel with what he’s asked them to do all year. I don’t know what any coach is looking at when he sees Sabonis and thinks that’s pascal Siakam defensively. Just completely different players. Sabonis isn’t happy the whole thing is a mess and Bjorkgren is also just constantly ad libbing and making this up as he goes in terms of night to night approach and game plan. The goal of creating chaos is succeeding...only it’s his team that’s in total chaos
"Ngl I didn’t realize how cheap sabonis was, that does make him a lot more appealing. Still tho, I vastly prefer the fit of pascal. He’s an average spotup shooter and he’s more comfortable offball, so he’ll fit offensively. Yes he plays the same position, but these guys are versatile, switchable defenders, I definitely think they would fit. Also, siakam at the 4 and dray at the 5 would be unreal.  Meanwhile, sabonis, yeah he’s good, but it feels like he plays the same role as dray on offense. Passing hub big man, needs the offense to run through him. I don’t see the defensive fit either- not really switchable, but doesn’t provide rim protection."
"I was watching the Lebron buzzer beater game the other day and it is remarkable how many good players the Raptors had that year. Derozan, Lowry, Valanciunas, Ibaka, and a young OG anunoby was a very good starting 5 if that’s what they would choose to run. They also had (albeit before any of their primes) Fred Van Vleet, Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, and Jakob Poeltl. One of the deepest rosters I’ve seen, set for the present and the future."
"I think that Julius Randle has a great shot at winning it this season, and his numbers haven’t jumped that significantly either. At least compared to previous winners like Pascal Siakam or CJ McCollum."
Pascal Siakam.
Should be 11 people. Need to separate Pascal and Siakam
"You don't understand basketball. You clearly didn't watch Toronto's championship run.  The disrespect and pure ignorance about what Kyle Lowry, Freddy VanVleet and Pascal Siakam brought to the table in that championship run. OG Anunoby was injured and didn't play either. You're dumb AF. Sad salty Dallas fan! Toronto rookie backcourt both dropped career highs, 57 points combined in Dallas. LUL One and done team! LUL"
"Wow the disrespect and pure ignorance about what Kyle Lowry, Freddy VanVleet and Pascal Siakam brought to the table in that championship run. OG Anunoby was injured and didn't play either.  You're dumb AF. Sad salty Dallas fan! Toronto rookie backcourt both dropped career highs, 57 points combined in Dallas. LUL One and done team! LUL"
"Pascal Siakam triggered.   AAAAYYYYYYYYYY!!! Any time he goes up at the rim. Love they guy, but the yell is so annoying."
Favourite: Pascal Siakam  Least Favourite: Bradley Beal
Pascal Siakam as a literal measure of pure pressure
Aaron Gordon is just Pascal Siakam drafted into a worse situation.
"Supposedly Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka used this to their advantage when guarding Joel Embiid during their 2019 playoff run.  &gt; Cool nugget from Raptors very international team. Serge Ibaka speaks french to Pascal Siakam, spanish to Marc Gasol &amp; english to the rest team. When Serge &amp; Gasol doubled Joel Embiid they would yell where to help from in Spanish so Joel (who speaks french) could not understand.  https://twitter.com/ROSGO21/status/1128011415435059200"
"Assuming CJ is gone in both scenarios, I'd take Simmons. Higher upside beats good free throw shooting imo.   Siakam is a bad 3-point shooter, but at least he takes them, worse passer, not any better in half-court offense and not a great shot selection overall. Simmons is more versatile on defense and slightly better on it altogether, even though I liked Pascal a little bit more protecting the paint last season, but that might be because he needed to do it for the Raptors and it did not exactly lead to winning. Simmons is faster, bigger, more talented and possibly only 1 eureka moment away from being a top 10-20 NBA player again.  It's about the ""Dame deserves to win it all"" upside and with Siakam instead of CJ, nobody would assume, that the Blazers have any realistic chance at the title, Simmons gives at least the hope."
2016: Pascal Siakam (wound up trading 22nd pick for Marco Belinelli- Siakam picked 27th)   2017: Donovan Mitchell (picked Monk at #11)     2018: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (actually picked him at #11 but swapped for Miles Bridges for a 2nd) / Mitchell Robinson in the 2nd (we got Devonte' and it was a great pick but Mitchell Robinson works better with the new team)       2019: PJ Washington at #12 (did well here) 2020: LaMelo Ball at #3 (no complaints in hindsight)  Would've been:  Ball/Mitchell/SGA/Siakam/Robinson with PJ Washington off the bench
Celtics:  PG: Malcolm Brogdon (23rd pick in 2016)  SG: Jaylen Brown (3rd pick in 2016)  SF: Jayson Tatum (3rd pick in 2017)  PF: Pascal Siakam (16th pick in 2016)  C: Mitchell Robinson (27th pick in 2018)
"Yeah bro and I’m pascal Siakam  And what could they have done? He’s not allowed to leave and all indoor facilities are shutdown, it was literally against the law 😂"
"Look at where the Raptors were before he got there and what they’ve accomplished since. Perennial lottery team and laughing stock to averaging 50+ wins and having the best accumulative record over 7 years.   Look at his draft record. He consistently pulls premium players out of late picks and the 2nd round (Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby).  Look at his eye for talent where no one else looks. Picking up undrafted players every off-season who quickly become impact players.  (Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis)   Look at his trade history.   In Denver he traded Carmelo to the Knicks where everyone knew he was going to go anyway but got a huge haul of young players + picks including the pick that became Jamal Murray.   He gets to Toronto and unloads Andrea Bargnani  for a package that would include a top 10 pick in 2016 which would later help him to secure Kawhi Leonard.   Then he begins swindling the league  John Salmons = Lou Williams (who then won 6MOTY)   Grieves Vasquez = picks that became Norman Powell and OG Anunoby   Terence Ross + a late 1st = Serge Ibaka   Derozan, Poeltl + a late 1st = Kawhi Leonard + Danny Green + 5M in cash   Valanciunas + Delon Wright = Marc Gasol   There isn’t an executive in the league that matches Masai’s overall excellence in every aspect of front office operations."
"Too early for Vince and I would say Kawhi’s efforts in getting is a ring puts him above for now (not to say Siakam did nothing to get that wrong, he was probably our 3rd biggest factor on the court). But give him time and Pascal could easily slot in that 3rd spot."

"Pascal Siakam - lives up this name 'Shock'em' when he takes over games  OG Anunoby - he's no longer a new noobie  Fred VanVleet - not a van rental company with a fleet of vans  Scottie Barnes - not a barn or more  Khem Birch - he could be a tree hard to move, yes  Malachi Flynn - His father Eric, active social media, doesn't think that nn (nick nurse) is fly for not giving his son playing time  Chris Boucher - lives up his Trebuchet moniker due to his unique 3pt catapult-like release"
"Stephon Marbury, players forgotten in this generation will probably be like Pascal Siakam, Victor Oladipo, Demarcus Cousins, and Kemba Walker just to list a few."
"&gt; idk if it’s just Scottie and Pascal it’s the fact you also have OG playing essentially the same role right?  Huh? Yeah, all three guard the whole court, but they run very different offensive roles.  Siakam is a high post distributor + pick and roll threat + Iso, OG is a spot up 3pt shooter/slasher, and Barnes is a drive and dish PG."
"""Siakam and Pascal aren't going anywhere"" - Shaq"
"Kyle Lowry was 100% more important to that fjnals run than siakam even if pascal played great, especially in the finals."
"Tbh Brett Brown was doing a great job in this series.  He basically got the sixers the 2-1 lead after they got blown out in game 1 from his matchup and timeout pattern changes.  Game 1 Butler and Harris got fkn bbq chickened by Kawhi and Pascal all game, from then he was the first coach to implement the Center on Siakam and forward on Gasol.   His sub patterns of pulling Embiid early too caused alot of issues for the raps since Nurse was being stubborn and not handcuffing Gasol's minutes to Embiid's.  Joel feasted on ibaka all series."
&gt;	There’re 5-10 players we’d trade Siakam for.  Masai was willing to trade either DeMar or Kyle for enough draft capital to draft Shai before he even played in the NBA.          They would absolutely trade Pascal for a talent with top 5 potential.
Sources: The Raptors are “enamoured” with Pascal Siakam
"&gt;Pascal is gonna stay unless someone of Dames caliber or higher becomes available  LOL you will never get anywhere near Dame with a package centered around Siakam, christ..."
"DeMar was better pure scorer and at getting his own shot. His peak season he averaged 27 ppg, Pascal in his best season averaged 23.  Siakam is a much better defender, but in that one same season I thought his defence actually took a step back due to his heavy load on offense."
"That wasn't the only incident between Nurse and Siakam last season.  [https://canadanewsmedia.ca/raptors-deny-report-pascal-siakam-has-been-fined-50000-for-comments-directed-at-nick-nurse-after-recent-loss-cbs-sports/](https://canadanewsmedia.ca/raptors-deny-report-pascal-siakam-has-been-fined-50000-for-comments-directed-at-nick-nurse-after-recent-loss-cbs-sports/)  Clearly it's not Shaq/Kobe level of beef, but there were a couple of incidents last season that got out that were maybe a bit concerning at the time."
"nah unlike the warriors, we don't have that ""go-to"" guy and to trade for such a go-to guy, we would lose a lot of the supporting cast that would make title contention viable. Heck, even if we traded Siakam for Lillard straight up somehow (much like Demar for Kawhi), we'd not be in the best position to compete.  I see no reason to send off Pascal and Fred just yet. Veteran leadership is important for developing the rookies. Jerami Grant is valuable to Detroit for such reasons. Yes Pascal is a little overpaid but he'll be movable when the time is right.  And for those advocating a tank yet again, I don't see why you need to force it. Raptors might still be in the bottom of the standings anyway."
"Chill. “Being shopped” is very different from listening to offers. Unless there is a Kawhi-like trade lined up Siakam isn’t going anywhere in the foreseeable future. Pascal understands that, being on the team when TOR traded DeMar."
"Look at the top scorers on lottery winners the past few years:   2021 draft: Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, Pascal Siakam  2020 draft: Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall (WTF?), Devonte Graham, Zach Lavine  2019 draft: Julius Randle, Mike Conley, Kevin Knox (also WTF), Lebron James  Well, if you go by that list being eligible players, then I guess it's Lebron... Well, this was a huge waste of time."

Siakam is better at everything else and for some things, it's not even close. Free throw shooting, shot creation, post moves, 2 and 3pt shooting, etc. Siakam has also shown growth while Simmons has been the same player for 5 straight years."

Pascal &gt; Siakam
Pascal Siakam  Kyle Kuzma
As a Raptor fan how can you say that about Derozan lol. Sure he wasn't excellent in the playoffs against Lebron but he always played well in the regular season with the Raptors. We aren't even talking about top-end talent like Zach Lavine who i'm sure if you made a poll most people would rank above Pascal Siakam.
Pascal Siakam  Jamal Murray
Pascal Siakam.  He had a bad bubble and a couple failed game-winners and all of a sudden people are acting like he is one of the worst contracts in the league.
Pascal siakam averages a triple double and the Raptors become the one seed and then crash losing in the first round to the 8 seed Bulls behind Demar Derozan averaging 36 ppg on 70% ts. He even hits six threes in the close out game.
"Pascal Siakam averages 28-7-6, FVV Averages 20-8 on All-defence, OG turns into 2014 Kawhi and Scottie wins ROY while winning the Championship"
Pascal Siakam has gotta be up there. You got some fanbases thinking they could pick him up for a bag of lays ketchup chips and a new printer out here.
"I feel like there’s 2 different ways to look at it, players who aren’t talked about, or players who are criticized far too much. So I’ll take one from each of these ‘categories’  Domantis Sabonis, Pascal Siakam"
2021: Jrue Holiday/Chris Paul  2020: KCP/Dragic  2019 Klay Thompson/Pascal Siakam   2018 Klay Thompson/JR Smith  2017 Klay Thompson/Kevin Love  2016 Draymond Green/Kevin Love  2015 Draymond Green/Kevin Love  2014 Kawhi Leonard/Chris Bosh  2013 Kawhi Leonard/Chris Bosh  2012 James Harden/Chris Bosh  2011 Ray Allen/Andrew Bynum  2010 Ray Allen/ Andrew Bynum  2009 Rashard Lewis/ Andrew Bynum  2008 Lamar Odom/Ray Allen  The only one I could compare Gordon too is JR smith and that team got swept.
Has Russell Westbrook really fallen that far down that he's considered the same level as Pascal Siakam?  Also Klay Thompson is worse than both of them?

"That's still basically the jist of it, but maybe he's harnessed that energy a little. I don't know about his time in Denver, but early in Minnesota his energy was just chaotic, good and bad. Like he'd snatch a rebound then try to do a Pascal Siakam impression and run the break and it'd end in a turnover.   But the big man spot next to KAT is such a void so Vanderbilit is certainly an option I hope they retain."
Pascal Siakam is pretty good when you’re not drafting with lottery picks tho lol. This argument makes no sense. You expect better than an all star player outside of the lottery and u say “take away his best move and he’s not as good”.
Pascal Siakam type beat
"Pascal is a #2 option at best, if he has the right kind of player with him to lead the charge. The man is lethal with an open floor, but if he's double teamed he falls apart and his play making in these scenarios is soft af.   This is why I wish we went with Suggs. They say Barnes has a higher ceiling, but our offense desperately needs someone to take the pressure off of Siakam. Hopefully Scottie matures enough to fill this role, otherwise you are 100% right."
"&gt; Pascal Siakam is an above average starter at best and his contract is gonna fuck us if we don't move him before other teams catch on.  30-35 mill is exactly market value for the type of player pascal is. Not overpaid at all, and is better than an above average starter lmao. This isn't an unpopular opinion it's just a dumb take"
"The 2020 Lakers are a historically weak title team. My any measure their competition on the way to the title was the worst since the merger, and almost any other way the bracket shook out would have pitted them against much harder opponents and probably led to them losing.  Pascal Siakam is an above average starter at best and his contract is gonna fuck us if we don't move him before other teams catch on.  Iverson winning MVP over Duncan is completely indefensible. Duncan was a better leading a better team.  Prime Terrell Brandon was about as good as prime Derrick Rose."
Masai Ujiri is crazy overrated.  Take out a rental Kawhi and his body of work is a 1st or 2nd round playoff team.   Hes also known as an elite drafter and the best player he's ever drafted is Pascal Siakam.  Good GM for sure but overrated.
"Warriors revamped their whole development staff. They added Dejan Milojevic who used to coach Jokic and develop him. He’ll help develop Wiseman’s foot work and court awareness for sure. They also signed Jama Mahlalela who was the assistant coach for the Toronto raptors and the raptors are known for having the best development staff in the league. Players like OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam are products of that. This will benefit both kuminga and moody but especially kuminga seeing the previous results. They also signed Kenny Atkinson who is known for being one of the best development coaches in the league. When he was the head coach for the nets he made them have a break out year and developed players like levert, Allen, and DLO. Also, the warriors had developed a lot of good players, it’s just bc they were in a dynasty for a while that they couldn’t use them. For example, both kendrick nunn and Chris Boucher developed under the warriors. Some examples on the current warriors include JTA and Jordan Poole. But they didn’t really have much to work with. Wiseman was their first lottery pick in years and you can’t really develop him much when there’s no summer league or training camp. But the fact is that they finally got good rookies and It’s a whole new coaching staff"
"I think pascal and Giannis would be nasty, especially since Siakam can knock down 3’s but I don’t think Giannis or Sikkam  would like playing the 5 all year so it might have to be bam who could take the physicality of most centers and still be switchable."
"""but he's closer to someone like Brad Beal in value than he is to say Pascal Siakam.""      ...no"
"There was a similar knock on Giannis in the playoffs before this year. Not to the same degree I admit, I'm not insane.  I get that Ben has some significant flaws but your last point is what I'm getting at. People are acting like he's completely broken after the Hawks series. Sure, he's not worth the Raptors haul Morey asked for - and Morey knows that - but he's closer to someone like Brad Beal in value than he is to say Pascal Siakam."
"If dame demands a trade - pascal siakam, or Brandon Ingram (if available),coupled with picks for Dame, or for CJ and picks - Is it worth exploring as a better option then Simmons, if Dame wants out?"
"Yeah I’ve kinda been watching his whole career on every team he’s on in hopes that maybe he turns into what he was supposed to be. I can’t comprehend what you’re talking about? That’s probably because you’re just making shit up and not realizing it. You talk about shooting without realizing that Wiggins plays next to the greatest shooter ever, he’s being helped immensely by Curry’s gravity, Siakam would be so fucking good next to Curry and he also guards 1-5 and plays amazing team defense, these are things Wiggins can’t and won’t ever be able to do. The difference on defence and offense between the two is actually really huge.   I don’t think I’m getting those players because we aren’t even trying to trade Pascal. You just watched your team miss the playoffs even though Curry went god mode yet you still defend your FOs decision to draft and keep the rookies? While you have the greatest shooter ever on the team getting closer and closer to exiting his prime? That’s just gross af imo."
"&gt; It would be easy to think that the MIP award is worthless; however, other recent winners include: Giannis, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, Pascal Siakam, and Dragic.  &gt; All-stars, champions, All-NBA players, etc.  cj mccollum has not been either an all star, all-nba, or a champion. why was he mentioned?  also why is merely being all-star or all-nba sufficient to say you ""have something to show for it""? if that's the case then considering four out of five of the named indiana players made all-star or all-nba (or both), that means they too have something to show for it"
[Here’s one from March](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2021/03/24/pascal-siakam-nick-nurse-verbal-exchange-crossed-line)
"Good point. Siakam has had playoff issues, specifically as the top guy. The teams that are trying to trade for him wouldn’t have him as the top guy. Pascal as a second action initiator is a great fit, and that role should be valued for contenders"
"This is the dumbest question. Yes Pascal is not a championship-tier first scoring option. There's like 5 players in the entire league who are. Neither is Ben Simmons and Dame might be but he's never even gotten close.   Pascal is a proven excellent 2nd or 3rd scoring option on a championship team. That is valuable to a lot of teams, such as the 6ers who would win a chip if they could swap Ben for Siakam straight, but Raps obv say no to that."

"Sorry for the belated response but I did want to get back to everyone here.  Look at the end of the day there's no needle-changing player that Portland can obtain right now. But by competent I mean moving away from an undersized backcourt and giving Dame a proper 2-way forward which he hasn't had since Nic Batum dipped.  Unfortunately trying to find a proper 2-way forward to pair with Dame is extremely difficult right now considering who may or may not be available and the fact that CJ's contract diminishes his actual value.  The big names I've heard are Harrison Barnes, Tobias Harris and Pascal Siakam. I don't think Harris is going anywhere; his contract is an albatross but he provides consistent value to Philly who's looking to contend with Embiid right now.  Siakam may be available, but it'd probably take CJ + all of Portland's firsts and I don't think Portland dumping the bank for Pascal is the needle-changing move. It gets them to a second-round exit at best and I'd also be worried about the fit of Siakam and RoCo since I don't trust either of those guys to defend the 3.   Harrison Barnes is the worst of those 3 guys but not by a huge margin and I think with the right trade CJ could be swapped for Barnes without having to fork over a ton of draft picks.  This is allows you to build a competent team around Dame to the best of your abilities and if Dame still decides to dip it's a lot easier to build for the future by owning your own picks and having trade-able assets."

"Sorry for the belated response but I did want to get back to everyone here.   In a vacuum absolutely, but Barnes is a much better *fit* on the Blazers who haven't had a proper 2-way wing since Nic Batum.

"Is forking over CJ + a warchest of firsts for Pascal Siakam really the right move though? That might get them to a second round exit at best.  Also would you be worried about the fit of RoCo and either Pascal/Tobias Harris? Both of the latter two guys are power forwards and I just see RoCo as a 4 in today's league, especially since he's a better help defender than on-ball guy."
"Mate, they took Stanley Johnson ahead of Devin Booker, Henry Ellenson ahead of Caris LeVert and Pascal Siakam and Luke Kennard ahead of Mitchell and Adebayo.   That's three straight where they made picks that were obviously the wrong decision in a row. That's why the problem is scouting."
"Dwayne Casey did not develop pascal Siakam, idgaf what anyone says. Our developed in spite of him. Fucking Dino coach and will be fired in 2-3 years"

HGH. I’d probably be more angry if I had to watch Pascal Siakam as my teams go to guy every game tho.
Westbrook was far and away the least efficient player to score 20+ PPG last year:  |Rk|Player|PTS|TS%| |-:|:-|-:|-:| |1|Russell Westbrook|22.2|.509| |2|Pascal Siakam|21.4|.547| |3|Jerami Grant|22.3|.556| |4|Nikola Vucevic|23.4|.560| |5|Malcolm Brogdon|21.2|.561| |6|DeAaron Fox|25.2|.565| |7|Julius Randle|24.1|.567| |8|Donovan Mitchell|26.4|.569| |9|Collin Sexton|24.3|.573| |10|Terry Rozier|20.4|.575| |11|Jayson Tatum|26.4|.576| |12|Brandon Ingram|23.8|.584| |13|Jaylen Brown|24.7|.586| |14|Devin Booker|25.6|.587| |15|Luka Doncic|27.7|.587| |16|Khris Middleton|20.4|.588| |17|Trae Young|25.3|.589| |18|DeMar DeRozan|21.6|.591| |19|Bradley Beal|31.3|.593| |20|Paul George|23.3|.598| |21|Domantas Sabonis|20.3|.601| |22|Jimmy Butler|21.5|.607| |23|Kyrie Irving|26.9|.614| |24|Kawhi Leonard|24.8|.622| |25|Damian Lillard|28.8|.623| |26|Giannis Antetokounmpo|28.1|.633| |27|Zach LaVine|27.4|.634| |28|Joel Embiid|28.5|.636| |29|Nikola Jokic|26.4|.647| |30|Zion Williamson|27.0|.649| |31|Stephen Curry|32.0|.655|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021.
I think Shaq would agree…assuming you saw him discuss both Pascal and Siakam on an episode of Inside the NBA.
"I'm not that high on Barnes. I think that Toronto just made the mistake that Orlando's been making for years becoming enamored with the long athletic tweener forward (fluctuating between the 3 and the 4) types because in theory they do so much. In practice who fits that description and is an all star level guy? Kawhi and Tatum, there's a tier difference between those 2 and then Pascal Siakam, and then theres another drop off in that archetype of player down to Tobias Harris, maybe a time ago Carmelo Anthony and Paul Millsap? I leave LeBron and KD off here (and I really dont feel comfortable with Tatum being in this category either) because they were uber skilled players before they were switchable defensive pieces. They're just so talented and uniquely built that you put them on the floor and build a lineup around them and if they end up the 4 instead of the 3 then youre not mad about it because they're the best player on the floor 90% of the time anyways.  Whereas I feel like over the last 20 years the high energy and high IQ  point guard has been a consistent floor raising guy that you always see on playoff teams. Kyle Lowry, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Jrue had some bad teams in New Orleans but him too. Go back a decade or more and throw guys like Tony Parker and prime Kidd on there too.  Idk i felt this since draft night I feel like Toronto outsmarted themselves with Barnes. He may end up being a good player and long switchable wings definitely don't grow on trees. I also may end up entirely wrong but I feel like we've talked ourselves into the archetype of Barnes in the mid/high lottery before and it ended up being a stinker pick."
Siakam &gt; Randle &gt; Pascal
Pascal Siakam hands down
"Fox and some stuff for Pascal Siakam. Mitchell, Hali, Barnes, Pascal, Holmes starting"
Hey GSW we've reconsidered.    We'll do a straight swap of Pascal Siakam for Kyle Guy.  Give us a call when you get a chance.
"Trying not to be a homer here, just looking at it from a demand perspective.  I think it depends on the team. Most teams could slot in Pascal much easier than they could slot in Ben. With the exception of teams with a dominant PF like the lakers or bucks, Pascal is a plug and play on basically every roster. He can be a second scoring option on a contender, and give great defence.   Ben, on the other hand, needs a first, second or maybe even a third scoring option (eg. Jimmy, Embiid, Tobias) to be in place before you bring him in. PLUS a stretch big. How many teams fit that bill?I think he's rudundant on the warriors with draymond there... But Kerr could probably make it work. The wolves? As hilarious as it would be to send the young socialite to Minnesota, they actually WOULD be a good fit, since the floor spacing that KAT gives allows ben to just be Ben. But then again, I think siakam is a better fit there anyways.  The clippers would actually work, since there's already so much scoring on the wings there, but in terms of assets, it won't happen.   Simmons also seems like waaaay more of a gamble based on his mental state."
"Yeah, but Masai really has no incentive or motivation to move Pascal right now. The Raptors are in player development mode, and it’s not like Pascal is in his 30’s. There’s nothing really that going to happen between now and the trade deadline that will change Pascal’s value, and there’s no harm in seeing how well this new roster gels. Who knows? Maybe a couple of prospect over perform and become trade chips you can package Pascal with.  Simmons is not only objectively a less useful player based on his past couple of playoff performances, but the Morey is under pressure to trade Simmons now. He should really be worried about Simmons becoming a more toxic asset if returns to the Sixers.  But like you said — Morey is on crack.   The Warriors are not going to get a good deal from Masai unless the Raptors decide to re-tank at the deadline; which I think is unlikely. I think they are just trying to use the Raptors as leverage to get a better deal on Lillard or Simmons; ie. we can get Siakam for X package, but we’ll throw in Y and take out Z for Simmons."
"I really would be shocked if Masai traded Siakam now; it’s just not his MO.   He likes to see where a team is around the trade deadline. It gives players a chance to develop into tradeable assets if he needs to pull the chute or tank. There’s no urgency to trade Pascal right now.   And like you said, this roster of 6’9 dudes is too interesting to not see play out for a bit.   Unless a team really offers something insane there’s really no point in trading Pascal."
Yet another wrinkle to the offseason love triangle (square?).   Ben Simmons &gt; California Teams &gt; Pascal Siakam &lt; FVV
"Pretty sure 99% of the Raptors fan base would mind with Pascal+More for PG? No thanks. That seems like a really dumb idea if you're trying to rebuild. Trade for a guy that will be trying to force his way out the second he gets here?      It's obvious most of the Pascal trade talk is being initiated by opposing teams. Everyone is trying to go after him now while his value is lower. Raptors probably still view him as worth a lot more and imo would have only thrown his name around in hypothetical trades where they were inquiring about Beal or Dame. Stuff like the Warriors deal, or even the Simmons for Siakam stuff is most likely originating from the other side, not the Raptors shopping him around."
"After some development we can throw Precious in there too, he has huge defensive upside  Lmao, here’s a potential future lineup  Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Precious Achiuwa."
"The Sacramento Kings have reportedly expressed interest in trading for Ben Simmons and Pascal Siakam.  [Jason Anderson](https://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/article253337543.html) of the Sacramento Bee reported Kings general manager Monte McNair wants to make a ""major move"" this offseason to get the team closer to playoff contention.  Per Anderson, there is skepticism as to whether the Kings are capable of getting a deal of that size done."
"Yeah Siakam would be a really good fit on the warriors IMO. He has a hard time getting double teamed, but who's double teaming Pascal when you need to guard Klay and Steph too? The disrespect being thrown his way by r/nba saying that Beal would be a better fit on the Warriors than Siakam was ridiculous"
"Statistically speaking, Wiggins scoring production prior to being traded is nearly identical to Siakam’s scoring production this past season and the one before it.  Andrew Wiggins 42 games before the trade (no curry or draymond): 22.4 ppg on 53.5 TS%  Pascal Siakam 2020/21 - 21.4 ppg on 54.7 TS%  Pascal Siakam 2019/20 - 22.9 ppg on 55.4 TS%  Those are very marginal differences"
"No it’s not lol, his 3pt shooting became so much more reliable playing with Curry and Dray. I like Wiggins too but Siakam is a title caliber power forward, an all-nba talent and proven playoff performer. Wiggins had one good year and Pascal has one down year, now Pascal is only marginally better? Replace Pascal on that 55 win 2019 Raptors team with Wiggins and they’re probably in the lottery"
Then the Kings can not get Pascal Siakam out of this
"In that case, no, the Sacramento Kings cannot get Pascal Siakam out of this. I wouldn't even take Haliburton + picks."
Pascal Siakam is an S tier for the Raptors
The funniest thing about Blazers fans is when they joke about what Morey wants for Simmons……while thinking CJ McCollum will net them Pascal Siakam 😂
" In no order:  PG: Simmons, Jrue, (healthy Dunn), Murray, Zo?  SG: Thybulle, Smart, Dort, Harris, Brooks   SF: Kawhi, OG, PG, Jimmy, Mikal   PF: Giannis, AD, Dray, healthy Isaac, RoCo  C: Gobert, Embiid, Bam,Turner, Capela  HM: Jakob Poeltl, Pascal Siakam, Derrick White, Aaron Gordon, Pat Bev when he’s not hacking, and Bledsoe when he tries. I think any of these guys could easily be swapped into that top 5 of their respective positions."
and Pascal Siakam and Robert Covington probably should be above the as well
"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.  PG: Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kris Dunn, Dejounte Murray, Fred Van Vleet  SG: Marcus Smart, Paul George, Dillon Brooks, Alex Caruso, Luguentz Dort  SF: Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, OG Anunoby, Lebron James  PF: Draymond Green, Giannis, Anthony Davis, Pascal Siakam, Robert Covington  C: Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela, Myles Turner"
"&gt; Golden State or the Warriors.  ""You got your eyes on Pascal""  ""No, I got my eyes on Siakam."""
"if people cared enough about Pascal Siakam, they would document his flops lmao"
"Eh I don’t really give a shit.  At the end of the day if I have make a Pascal Siakam flop compilation to convince you that a completely different player doesn’t flop then nothing will change your mind. And you know that.  LeBron was what, 26th in the league in FTA last season? Like 10 spots below Randle and Collin Sexton iirc. Must be a terrible flopper."
Same with Pascal and Siakam.  You never see those dudes together at the same time!
I will not take this Pascal Siakam slander any longer /s
Bigger ball handling wing?   Jump shot is a work in progress?   Draymond Green/Pascal Siakam comps for you!
"Tier 3 with KAT, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holliday, Zach Lavine, Pascal Siakam, etc.  The all star bench level"
"Yes, I missed a word and then corrected it almost immediately. It's not an interpretation, it literally is how the rule is stated. The rules state, clear as day, ""Contact which occurs on the hand of the offensive player, while that part of the hand is in contact with the ball, is legal."" Stop leaving out the part that proves you wrong: ""that part of the hand"". Here an example of acceptable hand contact: https://videorulebook.nba.com/archive/legal-play-defender-high-fives-shooters-empty-hand-after-release-no-foul/  Every play on the ball is not incidental contact. Almost all fouls are plays on the ball, or at least attempted plays on the ball (when covering on-ball). You are kidding yourself if you think that Jrue did not re-route Booker's arm. One can see that Jrue's other fingers are around Booker's wrist (which is not a part of the hand, anyway), and that he pulls Booker's arm in toward himself. Regardless, a pinky coming down with an arm's downward force behind it certainly can re-route an arm. I can easily move someone's arm with just my pinky, even if it hurts it a little bit.  I honestly haven't looked for analyst's opinions at all, I never really do on these things. A lot of those people know less than you or me. Like, how long did it take for Shaq to realize that Pascal and Siakam were the same person, again? I have seen many others agree with myself on social media; however, none of this matters. All that matters are the facts of the situation. You seem strangely upset. I don't think that the Suns deserved to win this game, but I am not about to stop arguing a position that is backed up by evidence just because you do not like it."
Pascal and Jak were on the same level at the time of the trade.  Masai wanted to hold onto Siakam.
"John Collins is good at lobbing the ball to Capela from the FT line on the short roll, and has literally no other passes in his arsenal lol.  Pascal Siakam sometimes creates extremely good passes to layups or corner 3s by isoing and convincing everyone he's about to take a bad shot, and then throwing a bullet at the last second. The rest of his passing arsenal is pretty meh.  Devon Booker's skip pass to the weakside corner is like 10x better than any of his other passes"
Pascal siakam
"• Yeah that’s literally where my brain went and something Cuban would totally do. I remember he wanted to form a big three with KP, Luka, and Vucci. Dude is a nut. 😂  • Spurs are severely needing a power forward and Collins fits the timeline of Murray &amp; Keldon Johnson perfectly. Kinda contradicts my Kemba to SA prediction but that’s more or less a shot in the dark with Kemba. I think of all the teams with the cap to sign Collins, the Spurs make the most sense.  • Knicks I explained earlier but it’s a temporary big three of Randle, Derozan &amp; Barrett and then next year you ship Derozan + picks for a younger better player. That way you don’t have to move Barrett or Randle when you go and make that godfather offer for another star.  • Dame would be Sabonis, Brogdon, 13 and some change. Puts Lillard with Lavert, Warren &amp; Turner. It’s a darkhorse prediction but I think they definitely have the assets to make a move if they wanted to. If they tried to package Brogdon &amp; 13 for Simmons I can see them making a package for Lillard too  • Explaining Wiggins to Toronto — he gets sent home with Wiseman + 7 + 2022 1st + 2026 1st (top-8 protected) for Pascal Siakam 🤔"
"You mean Pascal? Paschall's on your team.  He's only projected to be out the first 2 months of the season.  In this scenario I think we re-sign Lowry too, so Lillard/Siakam/Lowry with GTJ and  a decent centre is a pretty good team."
"**2022 Raptors**  PG- Jalen Suggs, Malachi Flynn   SG- Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., David Duke   SF- OG Anunoby, Deandre Bembry, Rodney Hood  PF- Pascal Siakam, Jericho Sims   C- Richuan Holmes, Chris Boucher, Freddie Gillespie"
Pascal siakam would be perfect.
"It’s down to how different websites define what a possession is — that’s why I couched it as **isn’t necessarily entirely true**. Pbpstats gives an explanation [here](https://dblackrun.github.io/2019/04/15/why-pbpstats-possession-counts-lower.html):  &gt; This season the NBA stats website started using exact possession counts instead of the estimate they had previously used. While exact counts had previously been available on some smaller sites, including my site, PBPStats, it was good to see what I would assume is the most visited site for NBA stats finally use exact counts. If you have compared numbers on the NBA site and on PBPStats you have probably noticed that the possession counts are different. How can the counts be different if both are using exact counts? Well it turns out defining a possession is not as simple as one might think. I will use game 1 of the Raptors Magic series to show a few examples of this.  &gt; At the end of the second quarter Danny Green makes a three with 0.4 seconds remaining. Orlando inbounds the ball to Aaron Gordon who fails to get a full court shot off before the buzzer sounds. Should this count as a possession for Orlando? Their percentage chances of scoring here are probably in the low single digits so does it make sense to count it the same as we would count a normal mid-quarter possession with a 24 second shot clock.  &gt; At the end of the third quarter Pascal Siakam misses a corner three. In the play-by-play Michael Carter-Williams is credit with a rebound with one second remaining in the quarter. Does that mean Orlando gets credited with a new possession after the rebound? As you can see from the video, it would take a miracle for them to score after the rebound.  &gt; At the end of the fourth quarter Kawhi Leonard missed a three pointer that would have tied the game and the ball went out of bounds with 0.5 seconds remaining. Orlando just needed to inbound the ball and have time expire to win the game. Should this be counted as a possession for them?  &gt; If you look at the stats for this game on the NBA site it has Orlando scoring 104 points on 99 possessions. On PBPStats it has Orlando scoring 104 points on 96 possessions. I don’t know exactly how possessions are counted on the NBA site, but the most logical guess I can make is the three possession difference is because the three examples above are all counted as possessions for Orlando. None of them are counted on PBPStats. Any possession that starts with two or fewer seconds remaining in a quarter isn’t counted as a possession, unless points are scored. I arbitrarily picked two seconds, but the goal was to limit counting end of quarter possessions with little to no chance of scoring.  &gt; This is why you will see the team efficiency stats 1-2 points per 100 possessions higher on PBPStats. This isn’t the only place where decisions need to be made on how to count a possession, flagrant fouls are another place (I count the free throws and possession following the free throws as two separate possessions), but it is the biggest one that would be causing most of the difference. I understand why one would count possessions the way they are on the NBA site - it’s easy to understand and easier to code, but I think not counting those end of quarter possessions give a better representation of a team’s efficiency. There is no perfect way to do it. Working with play-by-play data is always going to be messy and there will always be issues you hadn’t considered that come up. I think it’s good to have options available that make different choices and let the user decide which one makes more sense for what they are looking for."
Pascal Siakam if he keeps it up….
"Lol what. Yeah, every team should get Kawhi Leonard, Serge Ibaka, and Pascal Siakam, so easy."
i still cant fucking wrap my head around the fact that wiggins is younger than pascal siakam.
"He’s not close to top 5 bruh. Pascal Siakam is a great two-way player but he’s not top 5 either. Just being a good two-way player doesn’t vault you over the Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis etc. you’re delusional."
"I’d go with AD, Tatum, PG, Butler, and Kawhi even if Kawhi can’t defend at the same level as before in no particular order.  Klay needs to come back before I add him.  KD is just below those guys.  Jaylen is not there yet defensively (he’s great at 1 on 1 defense though).  I’d put Pascal Siakam, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Jaren Jackson Jr (assuming he comes back to what he was in the 2019-2020 season), and Dejounte Murray over Tobias."
"and Kawhi and OG Anunoby, and Pascal Siakam. And it faile the 1st two games when Kawhi wasn\t guaring him on perimeter. To suggest that an Euroleague team can do that is just funny"
"Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry...hmmm..."
lowry and siakam?????????? personally if i'm the raptors i'm keeping OG especially since it looks like ya'll have the opportunity to go super young. not that pascal is old.
"But that was a different situation - the Raptors knew they were getting played.   To quote the Toronto Star:   &gt; ""... the Thunder asked for Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, and four unprotected first-round picks as a starting point for Paul George. The Raptors believed they were being used as leverage, and believed Kawhi finally, truly wanted LA. And then he left.""  If they thought Kawhi was gonna stay, maybe they make a deal. PG, Westbrook and Kawhi is an impossible combo to resist. But Toronto smelled something fishy, they could tell Kawhi wasn't gonna be a Raptor for long... and they made the smart move. So the original point still stands - no one turns down a combo like that. You just gotra make sure you're *actually* getting a combo like that."
"I'm not sure about ""open jumpshots"" in this scenario. The defensive platform against Lebron has always been to let him shoot. Sure, sometimes it doesnt work. This is Lebron James we're talking about.  Zone defense. AD gets the ball at the key. His man is Kawhi Leonard, or Pascal Siakam. Both have the length and defensive wherewithal to defend well against a jump shot. He puts the ball down to drive, he's doubled. He either passes out or puts up a contested jumper. That's a win in my books.  Gasol is absolutely fine in this scheme. At worst, the ball is passed to whoever ""has"" Gasol. And maybe you get an open jump shot for KCP or whichever other bum plays for the Lakers in this scenario.  The point is, you make Lebron and co. score. You try to take AD out of the game. The 2019 (into 2020) Raptors can do this. So can the Bucks. The warriors win on offense and defending lanes.  Take AD out of the game, make Lebron beat you. He ain't good enough in 2020 friend. It's not a ""mickey mouse ring,"" but there's certainly something to be said for the matchups he and the Lakers' faced in the bubble."
Pascal Siakam this year is a good counterexample
Yeah only arguable ones I see are    Rudy Gobert vs Donovan Mitchell   Myles Turner vs Domantas Sabonis   Pascal Siakam vs Kyle Lowry   Gordon Hayward vs LaMelo Ball
"This is the problem with r/nba that people say dumb shit and don’t get checked for it. We HAD bad player development because of Luke Walton’s staff. Now we have had for the last two years the best development coach in all of basketball in Phil Handy. Look at the Kings under Walton and you see their young talent hasn’t quite reached potential, and then look at how literally every NBA player works with Phil Handy. He has been an assistant coach on Nick Nurse’s staff, Tyronn Lue’s staff, and Frank Vogel’s staff. He has and still works with guys like Kawhi, Lebron, Kobe, Kyle Lowry, Kyrie Irving, Pascal Siakam, Anthony Davis, Rajon Rondo, Spencer Dinwiddie, and countless others that all have sung praises about him. There’s a reason why Steve Nash wanted him on his staff this past offseason and the Wizards were interviewing him for the job this offseason."
pascal siakam would have made the same money on a 5 year deal instead of a four year. 4/128. it’s roughly the same yearly salary lol
"First of all, he won't get that much. i think he'll get a Pascal Siakam sorta deal about $130milliom over 4 years, which is fine for a kid who lives in the gym and makes huge leaps yearly."
"Since Siakam seems to be on the table for the right deal, how would this look for all involved?   Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Malik Beasley  Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Ricky Rubio  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Some number of Sixers 1sts (1-4). Maybe two of them?   Sixers get a star wing who can score plus a microwave 20ppg scoring guard.   Timberwolves turn their backup guards and a young prospect into Ben Simmons, who fills all the holes in their starting lineup. DLo/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a damn solid core.   Raptors flip Pascal for a haul - a great prospect (McDaniels), two good prospects Thybulle, Maxey), a veteran PG who can replace Lowry or come off the bench (Rubio), and some pick(s) from the Sixers."
Statistical significance says Pascal Siakam.
Or Pascal Siakam
"Wiggins was literally second (behind Mike Conley) in opponent FG% and played *stifling* defense all season. He's a significantly better shooter and a reliable iron man, while Pascal Siakam was a worse shooter *before* his shoulder injury and is generally quite injury-prone."
"He can have a Pascal Siakam type ceiling imo. So yeah, 3rd option would be great"
I would swap Brandon Ingram with Russel Westbrook. Then I would move Ben Simmons down to tier 8 while moving up Pascal Siakam into tier 6 and SGA into tier 7. Finally I would swap Julius Randle and Kyle Lowry.
"Terrence Ross over Jonathan Isaac, Julius Randle over Derrick Rose and Pascal Siakam over Kyle Lowry. The other 27 I agree with."
Yeah it’s easy when Pascal Siakam is by far the worst defender in your front court rotation. Doesn’t really apply to many teams.
"West  S - Stephen Curry S - Luka Doncic S - LeBron James S - Kawhi Leonard S - Nikola Jokic B - Damian Lillard B - Devin Booker B - Paul George B - Zion Williamson B - Anthony Davis WC - Donovan Mitchell WC - Karl-Anthony Towns or Ja Morant or Chris Paul  Snubs - 2 omissions above and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Klay Thompson, and De’Aaron Fox  East  S - James Harden S - Kyrie Irving S - Kevin Durant S - Giannis Antetokounmpo S - Joel Embiid B - Trae Young B - Bradley Beal B - Jimmy Butler B - Jayson Tatum B - Bam Adebayo WC - choose 2 of Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Khris Middleton, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, and Pascal Siakam"
"It's different. Kawhi said to the Raptors FO  ""get me a superstar here and I'm staying, get me Paul George.""  The FO said no, they could not sacrifice Pascal Siakam.  So it's not really Kawhi wanted to leave."
Pretty sure Pascal Siakam has led the league in contested 3’s in 2 of the last 3 seasons.
"1) Re-Sign Curry no matter what  2) Bring back Klay ASAP  3) Trade this years picks no matter what. I don’t want to see the Warriors wasting time trying to develop young players. In order, try for:   - Paul George if the Clippers blow it up - Pascal Siakam  - Jerami Grant  - TJ Warren  - Dillion Brooks"
"It's blowing my mind seeing a Celtics player say this about KG  Duncan was a '00s big. One of the _best_ '00s bigs, but he still basically did '00s big things (as you say he did them better than KG, who didn't have the strength to really succeed as an '00s big).  KG was like ... a mash-up of Anthony Davis and Pascal Siakam. He could guard on the perimeter, do some supplemental rim protection from the 4, play small-ball center if you really needed it (and Boston did at times during the title run IIRC).  I really think KG got shafted not just in terms of situation but in terms of era. Maybe it's just because I'm a Nuggets fan and he might be the best historical guy to put next to Jokic, but I feel like if you put Duncan and KG in a time machine KG is the all-NBA PF over Duncan, who also doesn't make all-NBA C over Jokic or Embiid."
"&gt; In the playoffs last year, there wasn’t a clear best player between Lowry, Van Vleet, and Siakam. Lowry didn’t carry any series, he played a little better than Fred and Pascal in that series yes. Idk how you can say an exploding of averaging 39% shooting on 17/5/5  The clear best player was Lowry, Siakam was NOT even in that convo cause he was imploding what are you even talking about?  17/5/5 on 39% shooting against the Celtics? That's wrong. Lowry averaged 20.7/6.3/6.4 on 56.2% true shooting. I guess 20/6/6 on 56.2% true shooting while your All-NBA 2nd team teammate essentially fell apart in the bubble isn't good enough for you. For reference, FVV was 18.7/4.6/6.4 on 46.3% TS. Lowry was CLEARY better than FVV let alone Siakam."
"In the playoffs last year, there wasn’t a clear best player between Lowry, Van Vleet, and Siakam. Lowry didn’t carry any series, he played a little better than Fred and Pascal in that series yes. Idk how you can say an exploding of averaging 39% shooting on 17/5/5  The fact that you guys still hold an unbelievably low bar for an all star guard is hilarious"
"&gt; Ok cool, we can agree to disagree. If next season passes and his 3ball % regresses that contract is fair to not great.   If OG regresses to the mean of 37.5% that still makes him an above average shooter and unlike Siakam who regressed from three he has shown three point ability from his rookie season which he shot 37.1%. This three point regression fear you have isn't something of concern, he isn't a Joe Harris whose only value is that. Three point shooting is a strength, a great one at that, but it isn't his most valuable aspect. Its an unfounded fear imo unlike with Siakam which was a concern I had coming into his extension.  &gt; I mean y’all were saying the same things before this year about Pascal when he shot the skin off the ball. Now, after a sub 30% season from distance his value isn’t even close to what it was and I’m damn sure he’d never be given the contract he has.   Any player who was the second option on a championship team is getting the max no matter what, and Siakam regression this season makes sense as he is a career 32.5% three pointer shooter which is why I actually was expecting some sort of regression from three though not this drastic. Even with the three point regression, Siakam is still a valuable player due to, just like OG, his being an elite defender at the wing who also defends legit 1 through 5. OG is tops in defensive versatility star and Siakam is not far behind him (94th percentile). And by shoot the skin off the ball do you mean 35.9%, just about average?  Even with the regression from three, Siakam has actually shown improvement as a defender but also as a ball handler and playmaker as well especially off a handoff coming out the corner or wing. Increased his assist numbers while keeping his turnovers stable (per100, 4.7A to 6.0, 3.3TOV to 3.1, 10.7TOV% to 10.6). Siakam is also 2nd in contested threes per game, 3rd in forced TOV% in isos, 3rd in opponent fg% from 5-9 feet (which came with him being forced to play significant minutes out of position at the 5), 4th in def loose balls recovered, 5th in iso points per possession allowed, 4th among PFs in total contested shots per game and ranked 94th percentile in defensive versatility. Bonafide elite defensive player who outside of his three point regression has taken a step forward as an offensive player.  For someone who worked for the Raptors for 17 years, calling OG heavy footed when it is actually a strength for him is odd to say the least."
"Wiggins had more defensive win shares this season and was second only to Mike Conley in opponent FG%. Siakam is not a better defender statistically.  Any player who needs the ball in his hands to be effective is a significant downgrade, since that would mean taking the ball *out* of the hands of vastly better players.  The ability to play off ball is enough to make Wiggins better than Pascal."
"Since Pascal broke out in 2018 he’s better than Wiggins in every statistical category advanced, traditional, offensive, defensive, with last year being the only year where Wiggins shot more efficiently. Siakam has been the better defender, playmaker, and scorer. He’s the only one of the two to be named to an All-NBA team.   He wouldn’t be a downgrade for the Warriors, but if you believe Wiggins shooting last year (which was an outlier for his career), it could be argued him as a 3rd option makes more sense than Pascal who is a better player with ball in his hands."
"For AD, PG, Harden, and Jrue (which was more about keeping Giannis)... You're talking about Pascal Siakam.   You only get 3 max players, I'm not breaking the bank for Pascal against the Nets/Bucks. Save the assets and hold out for Lillard/Beal. Especially unprotected 1sts."
"One hundred percent.  On the Warriors, Wiggins has been a statistically better defender, averaging 2.7 defensive win shares to Siakam's 2. Two-Way Wiggs has been a lockdown defender against wings, guards, AND bigs. This season he was second to only Mike Conley in opponent FG%.  He's a better shooter, and he only missed *one* game this season - and that was a decision by coaching staff to rest the starters in a game that didn't matter, he *could* have played.  Siakam, meanwhile, has injury problems - who knows how his shooting will be at all after having a significant shoulder injury - and doesn't have the advantage (which Wiggins does) of having over a season to learn to play within the flow of Golden State's quite complex offensive system.  Wiggins is *excellent* at that.  The Warriors have Draymond Green and the Splash Brothers. What they need is reliable depth. Sacrificing a very reliable player who's been solid and consistent *plus more depth* for Pascal Siakam makes the Warriors worse."
"&gt; This is r/nba bruh it’s not r/MkeBucks  And you don't see me showing up in every Raptors thread.  Because I'm not obsessed.  (And because no one is talking about your shitty team.)  Your trolling is boring, turning off inbox replies on this.  Have fun staying salty, and continuing to watch the Raptors suck into the future.  Oh hey, one last thought: remember when your fans actually thought Giannis had any interest in going to Toronto to play with Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet, just because Masai helped his family one time when the NBA asked him to?  That was pretty funny!  Maybe you were one of those morons and that's why you've stayed so salty to this day.  I guess I'll never know, well, until the next Bucks-related thread where you're bound to show up.  Goodbye until then."
"They were the 2 seed last year and their ""star"" is Pascal Siakam."
"Off the top of my head, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby, and Jimmy Butler were at the end of the first, Devin Booker 13th, Giannis mid-first.  Just gotta have a really good scouting department and trust them."
"&gt;	Lowry leaves then who is running the point?  I would rather have FVV and potentially Suggs share PG duties next year. The half court offense cannot be worse than what Simmons provide, and Pascal can handle the ball in transition.              &gt;	A team built around Simmons FVV/Siakam is a solid starting point going forward if Lowry bounces  I would much rather build a team on the timeline of OG, Gary Trent, and whomever we get at the 4th."
"Because now more than ever we see guys push through the ceilings we try to put on them. Look at Giannis when he came into the league, borderline unplayable, now he’s a guaranteed 1st ballot HOFer and he’s only 26. Pascal Siakam went from raw gangly rebounder to 2nd option on a chip team and All-NBA 2nd team. Late bloomers like Lowry or Jimmy Butler went from role players to legitimate all-stars. Even 5 years into Julius Randle career, no one would’ve said he’d ever make all-star and all-nba 2nd team but look what he just did. It doesn’t make sense to put a ceiling on someone who’s going to be in the NBA for 15+ years and constantly developing their game."
"If they want to be in the playoff hunt I think they need to get a solid vet that brings a winning mentality like CP3 did with the Suns. In a perfect world like a Pascal Siakam or Draymond Green, but    that probably won’t happen."
That’s what we did when Myles got hurt and it didn’t work. I’m not going to speak on defensive scheme because it will be wildly reworked this season since whatever we were doing last year did not work at all. Bjorkgren had Sabonis playing 4 and covering more ground on defense than any other player in the NBA like he was Pascal Siakam lol
"It's entirely bias because he is your greatest asset as an okc fan. He is great, but you seem to miss the fact that as an okc fan you're going to obviously have a biased opinion on your players just like any other fan base.  You also said ""okc fans will tell you"". Like dude, raptors fans will tell you everyone around the league underrates pascal siakam. It's straight up a biased opinion."
"Ok? That won’t even get them Pascal Siakam, how would that work for Shai?"
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
He also played at a time when teams were loath to let players that young make mistakes and develop and also at a time when they didn't know how to use someone with his build. He was in between a 3 and 4 - too skinny to bang down low with the other PFs of the day but not quite skilled enough to be a 3. If he was coming out today he would have no problem playing as a small ball 4 and he would have been encouraged to develop his handle and jumper at a younger age which he wasn't really back then. He was like the early 2000's prototype of Pascal Siakam.
Pascal Siakam regressed significantly
"&gt; You can bookmark my comment that says Brown is reaching his ceiling and isn’t enough to be a #2 on a Championship team for the next 6 years.  It's not worth bookmarking though.  Jaylen Brown is putting up an efficient 26/6/3. That's better than almost every #2 in championship history. Plus his playoff performances have outperformed his regular-season performances 4 times out of 4, his game translates really well to the post-season.   If 3rd year Pascal Siakam can be the #2 scoring option on a title team [\(as part of a historic scoring duo\)](https://np.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/ivab0t/fun_fact_pascal_kawhi_are_tied_for_the_2nd_most/) then so can Jaylen Brown.   The question isn't on Brown. It's on the coaching and FO. Our title chances depend on whether we can adequately build around Jayson and Jaylen."
Pascal Siakam
"Idk what exactly Toronto gets, but this is a 4 team trade idea I have to get 3 players in different situations.   Pascal Siakam -&gt; PHI, Ben Simmons -&gt; GSW, Draymond Green -&gt; POR  Why the Sixers do this: Siakam is a much cleaner fit next to Embiid offensively due to his superior shooting abilities, whilst at the same time, not blocking the development of guards like Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton. Siakam takes over Simmons role as primary perimeter defender. More than anything, this trade makes Embiid *happy* as Siakam is one of his guys since they are both from Cameroon.   Why Golden State does this: This is a bet on Ben Simmons reviving his career in the most optimal situation for him. You are essentially hoping to turn Ben Simmons into the next Draymond Green with some slight differences, Simmons is not the rim protector that Draymond is, which makes Wiseman important, conversely Simmons is a much better perimeter defender and a point of attack defender is needed with Klay likely not being up to scratch in that kind of role anymore.   This is a talent acquisition bet for Golden State, their 5 they would be rolling with would be Simmons/Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Wiseman.   Why the Blazers do this: This is pretty simple, to make Dame happy. Dame and CJ have long wanted to play with Draymond after that 2019 WCF series where they were exposed to just how good he was, CJ went as far as photoshopping him in a Blazers jersey.   I'm not too sure what Toronto ends up with in this scenario, Covington for sure as part of salary matching and I suppose one of Nurkic or Derrick Jones Jr.?   Not sure who would need picks out of this to be properly compensated."
"Ben Simmons, Pascal siakam, a group of guys from the grizzlies would be very helpful too.  Getting more depth might do more then getting a star.   The back up center, Brooks, one of their forwards could go a long way."
"i really hope Masai trades for him.   but to your point, if a guy is 8-26 or 5-23 then Ben did his job.   If the eye test looks off it's maybe b/c you don't know what you are looking at.   Trae is a PnR savant.  nobody shuts it down.  But forcing him to do things he might not want to do like rushing floaters from his non preferred spots made it a hard time.     small guards are his weakest areas, b/c dude is 6-11.   but for the most part he hangs with them just fine and causes problems.   https://thesixersense.com/2021/03/01/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-best-defensive-games/  &gt;Dec. 29, Sixers vs. Raptors — Pascal Siakam Siakam Stats – 7:02 mins | 7 pts |  3-11 FG |  0-0 FT | 0 ast | 1 TO  Simmons Stats – 1 stl | 1 blk  Siakam had some success against other Sixers’ defenders but couldn’t do much against Simmons. Six of Siakam’s field goal attempts against Simmons were 3s, most of which were Siakam settling instead of trying to attack the rim. Siakam had very little success the few times he tried to drive on Simmons as well. Ben is one of the few defenders in the NBA who has both the size and speed to cover Siakam, and it showed in this game.  maybe you prefer a homer article showing how much trouble he gives your squad's best player  https://www.raptorshq.com/2020/2/27/21155484/pascal-siakam-defense-stoppers-giannis-antetokounmpo-ben-simmons-bam-adebayo  or maybe you want to see more about him vs other star wings  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/ben-simmons-nba-all-star-game-2020-analysis  &gt;While those numbers are all mighty impressive, the job he’s done just manning people up has been nothing short of stellar. When you look at the All-Star caliber players Simmons has defended this season, he’s kept them all in check. Jimmy Butler (3 of 12), Jayson Tatum (3 of 11), Pascal Siakam (5 of 19), Bradley Beal (6 of 14), LeBron James (2 of 9), Russell Westbrook (4 of 13) and James Harden (3 of 9) have shot a combined 26 of 87. That’s a combined field goal percentage of 29.8."
"You guys have Looney who is more than a serviceable big. Personally I'm a fan of the trade for the Warriors, more so than I am for the Raps (Raps fan but long time Warriors and Curry follower since We Believe) Pascal has shown great success as a secondary or tertiary scorer if he has guys on the perimeter that demand attention. Klay, Steph, Poole and all the guards they have been developing will demand enough gravity for him to flourish as a scorer again like he did with Kawhi, and JTA fits the mold for GSW as a 1-4 perimeter player  Fact of the matter is Siakam fits their smallball play style better than Wiggs or Wiseman does. We likely lose KL in FA this year, FVV is just entering his prime, he will be a solid veteran leader presence for the young boys, I'd love to see a FVV, GTJ, Suggs, OG, Wiseman type of lineup. It could be a fringe Playoff surprise or rough season like the Warriors had for a year or two, but once GTJ/Suggs/Wiseman take that leap I think we would see greatness.   Wiseman's a good enough physical specimen that I would take a chance on it."
"That 7th could become anything, maybe even a Pascal Siakam type of player!"
"Pascal Siakam isn't better than Wiggins but people want the Warriors to send out Wiseman, Wiggins (gotta match salary) AND the 7 and 14 picks in this years supposedly loaded draft?  That's dumb as hell."
"If it weren’t for klay Thompson getting injured a few times - I’d say the warriors are perpetually in great shape from a roster standpoint.  They have a lot of good problems to have.  Curry, Thompson, Kelly oubre, draymond green and pascal siakam as a small ball center.  Watch out.  That team is gonna win a lot of games."
As a warriors fan I DO NOT WANT PASCAL SIAKAM.  I'd rather keep the picks and Wiseman than get spicy p.
They really think they get get Pascal AND Siakam for that?
why would raptors trade pascal for a bad centre and a pick that is extremely unlikely to become better than pascal siakam?
"I don't think any one player in the league could replace what Draymond brings to the Dubs defense. I don't see him getting traded yet before they get a chance to see Klay back on the court again. Not worth the hit to the Warriors scheme/culture to trade Dray for Pascal Siakam, as good a player as he is.  In any case, I don't see Oubre coming back since he'll command 15m a year in FA and is probably best as a 6th man. Dubs should let someone else pay him, especially since they still have Jordan Poole on rookie money and he looks like he'll probably be the better player if he isn't already."
NBA Finals Pascal Siakam...   But fr LeBron
"Trade aside, Siakam is much better than Wiggins. Pascal had a tough year last year. He was injured, had COVID and was uprooted to Tampa. All of that certainly affected his game negatively, and yet he STILL had better numbers and was more productive on both sides of the ball than Wiggins was. When you're talking about a player who has All-NBA talent vs a borderline all-star, yes, the disparity is certainly wide enough to give up picks and a player who MIGHT be something some day."
"Uhhh... ignoring the Warriors flare, it’s not too much. Wiseman is still heavily in need of development, we’ve already seen the extent to what type of player Wiggins is, and the 7th pick is the saving grace for the whole deal. With Pascal Siakam, you’re adding an all-star caliber player that can provide an immediate positive impact for an aging Warriors roster (Steph, Klay, and Dray have already dealt with a myriad of injuries - their prime years of contending are closing fast)."
"He is but the trade isn’t worth it. Also, we’re not looking to harvest Pascal because then we’ll have to find somebody as versatile as Pascal to replace him. Siakam on the other hand..."
"No Pascal is a beast who just had a rough year.  Hopefully he snaps out of it, but we literally wouldn’t do that deal for the all star version of Siakam.  Did people really not see how good Wiggins was for us?  We run a complicated offense and he learned how to fit perfectly in it while playing great defense all year.  Siakam is worth more, sure, but not by a 7th and 2nd overall pick.  I mean you could make the argument that Wiggins was better last year than Siakam."
"GSW would ask for more than Siakam with Wiggins thrown in and i think the only piece that makes sense would be OG.       Wiggins is a positive value after this year, Siakam's value is lower, Wiseman still has very high value (imo) and a 7th overall pick is always high value.  TBH they should be looking to rebuild and Pascal is a lot older than i thought at 27.  With the 4 and 7 this year, last year's number 2 in Wiseman, they could have a very promising young core if things pan out.  Obviously OG would fit with that but i don't know how the trade gets done otherwise.     Could of course understand raps fans not wanting that trade but i think if it happens that's how it does."
"fuck off. this is pascal siakam, hes not even top 10 and you want that bag for him?"
"It's not my joke but I would like to hear E-40 say ""Pascal Siakam""."
"Theoretically not, I guess, if the Warriors think they're getting 2nd option Pascal from the 2019 title team (plus any developments he's made, minus any regressions), and they're trading away an outlier season from Wiggins who's more likely to ""regress"" to Minny Wiggins.  The 2 things that'll be critical to this being a successful trade for the Warriors is how successful and productive Siakam is integrating into Golden State's system and how healthy will a ""healthy"" Klay be coming back.  And that won't solve all of GSW's problems... the bench is very thin compared to the pre-KD/early-KD Warriors teams benches. Look at how deep teams like the Clippers and Suns are now just in the West."
"You got your eye on pascal?  Nah, I got my eye on siakam"

It’s a similar surgery Paul George had in 2019 (actually less complicated for Siakam) and PG was back on the court 6 months later.

I dont want to see pascal siakam there...
"&gt;Pascal would be a Draymond/Iggy hybrid for GSW.     I just don't see how that would make him the number 2 option.  Durant is a singular talent, of course he supplanted Klay as the number 2 scoring option (hell, he was often the number 1).  Klay is the second best shooter of all time.  Dude is gonna be the number 2 option if they get Siakam and Siakam is gonna have to integrate."
"Oh yeah, and he won’t because his style of play allows him to be a 3rd option and still put up #’s. But in terms of like initiating offence or whatever, that’s not who he is and that’s what I mean by Siakam Being the 2nd.  Pascal would be a Draymond/Iggy hybrid for GSW."
"If they landed:  Steph   Klay  McDermott  Dray  Siakam  as their new death lineup they would be pretty fucking bad playing defense or getting rebounds but very fucking good at scoring baskets   But Pascal is a weird pickup because with him, Dray, and a center for rebounding you start to clunk up what should be a fast moving offense"
&gt;	Pascal Siakam is in his prime and lookin to get traded to the Warriors.  Nice bait
"I don’t really see what the end game is though. They’d be sort of halfway between rebuilding and competing when they’ll still have OG and FVV (plus Wiggins) on big contracts.  Like you’d have to really believe in Wiseman as a difference maker (7th pick is just bleh) or else you’re really not in that much of a different spot than you would be just keeping Pascal, probably just slightly worse because Wiseman was bad and Siakam &gt; Wiggins."
"Pascal? No, I have my eyes on Siakam."
Just pick scottie barnes and be on your way if the best youre gonna get is pascal siakam in a trade
"In order for this trade to work, Andrew Wiggins would have to be in the deal to make salaries line up. Why would the Warriors trade Wiggins, a lottery pick, and James Wiseman for Siakam?   Siakam is nice, he's a slight upgrade over Wiggins, but not nearly worth giving up James Wiseman and the number 7 pick on top of the deal.   Maybe a sign and trade with Oubre + #7 and #14 for Siakam but then the Warriors are paying a crazy luxury tax again.  I think the Warriors are hunting for bigger game than Pascal Siakam."
"I disagree.  I think we need a guy like that in the paint for us.  Remember we won that first ring with an aging Bogut nonetheless balling out for us in a similar role.  Wiseman may be a great prospect but our window's going to close on our big three soon, and probably sooner than Wiseman can really become a force in his own right.  Siakam gives us a better chance to win now, especially with Klay on the floor, and we've developed guys like JTA and Pascal and Poole who can make up for the loss of Wiggins."
"More than that, below the surface I feel like Siakam and Masai have a personal relationship, and while he'd never ""trade"" Siakam, I think maybe the sentiment might change for one reason – where Siakam lands, and how this season went. Maybe Pascal has a ceiling in Toronto and he wants him to land where he sees Pascal growing the most."
Siakam is making 33 next year. Wiggins (31) + Wiseman(9) would have to include something else from Toronto. I doubt this would happen as Wiggins to Pascal isn't a big upgrade (I would rather have Wiggins tbh). Warriors need shooters around Curry/Thompson as Pascal shot 29.7% from 3 last year while Wiggins had a career best 38%.  Maybe Pascal is better on D than Wiggins? But I think Wiggins was really good last year and just what they need.
yes. his name is pascal siakam  he scored 1 more ppg than wiggs on worse efficiency this year and is older. and is on contract for one more year than wiggins while being paid more
"Okay, so here's the thing. They're pretty close offensively, and Siakam is definitely better there. Contributes more on better efficiency not a black hole, possessions dont end when Pascal touches the ball.  Now, defensively? they aren't even in the same stratosphere.  Wiggins turned into an okay / slightly above average defender this year. Pascal is fucking ELITE defensively. Guards 1-4 VERY well and is one of the best help / perimeter defenders in the league.  This would be a MASSIVE upgrade over Wiggins, and I'm not even a wiggins hater."
Pascal Siakam appears to be back.
"There's also been almost no production outside of Fred/Pascal/Kyle/OG on either side of the ball.  Chris Boucher has shown flashes in a few games, is all.   Bench productivity is one of the worst in the league, which you can't have when Siakam has been struggling offensively in all but one game."
"&gt; Siakam, similarly, only sometimes scoots up to the 4 while OG plays the bulk of their 4 minutes.  With how doodoo Baynes/Lens are, until they get better at the 5, I think OG's gonna have to play small ball 5 while Pascal plays the 4. Raptors are screwed at the 5 position."
Anyone else see the resemblance between this guys and Pascal Siakam? I always think they are similar type of players. Jonathan Isaac too
Pascal Siakam
Pascal siakam = pulled the seat off him
"I'm saying Tatum. Siakam does not fit the description of Tatum's full comments. Tatum is trying to praise players.  If the other poster didn't mean it that way, then I'm wrong. But it definitely reads more like another joke on Pascal."
Pascal Siakam
"I mean, if Pascal balled out in the bubble and led the Raps to the finals no one would really care if he was struggling. Not to mention, Buttler is a more proven player. Siakam basically shit his pants in the bubble, and took a dump on the logo in the Celtics series.   It is really unfair no one cares Jimmy has been trash for like 6 games while Pascal has to field some serious questions as to if his All-NBA season was a fluke?"
"but how did I misinterpret it then? The guy above me said “Pascal Siakam” as an example of a player that Tatum could potentially name that didn’t play like they normally do, which is correct. He played worse than he normally did..."
can you interpret what the guy who commented “Pascal Siakam” means when you put it into the scenario of what Tatum is saying? lol

Then by the same token why not let Ibaka and Fred leave and save cap space to sign him to pair him with another star thru FA then? Signing Fred is still giving us a lottery record if we are using this as your argument. Why limit giannis to the Fred/pascal core then. Why not pair let's say Oladipo/Siakam/Giannis core. This discussion is such a wash because both sides can argue whether to sign or let them walk. But the fact is having Fred still and Ibaka leaving is currently giving us a 1-6 record. Guard heavy rotation and no good bigs.
"That's called a proper rebuild. OKC had superstars. As much as you hate to say it westbrook is a superstar. They got that core 3 from fucking rebuilding. Pascal is not a superstar yet. Fred is not even remotely close to those you mention. That's disrespectful. Aight I'm done discussing this cuz you really don't get it. Agree to disagree, I'm moving on. You can think whatever you want. The fact is we are still 1-6 with siakam and Fred as a core without Ibaka and other championship pieces besides lowry. Whatever floats your boat. It's a road leading to mediocrity unless pascal becomes a superstar 1st option. Enjoy your night. Agree to disagree and we can end it at that. Even Masai wanted a rebuild in 2013-2014."
"Fred VanVleet, Cade Cunningham, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam"
"GREAT comeback game from Pascal Siakam 🌶️🔥🙏  Len needs to start in place of Baynes; Baynes is doing a whole lotta NOTHING out there  Besides Boucher, hardly anyone is giving enough productive minutes off the bench  Defence, especially perimeter, NEEDS to tighten up. I don't think I've EVER seen the Raptors let that many open 3pt shots fly....."
I still believe in Pascal Siakam
Everyone shitting on Baynes (and he’s been rough) but every player not named Pascal Siakam for the Raptors currently shooting 0% from the field so...
I thought [Tjarks](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/5/22214917/toronto-raptors-pascal-siakam-struggles) had a good take on this on The Ringer. He thinks teams are playing Pascall with more mobile wings that can keep up with his quickness and he doesn't have enough shooting or playmaking to make up for it.
"Dont use fantasy ppg their system is wack and isnt conclusive of a good performance as its very volume based. Pascal in the early season has put up 17.6ppg on 40.7/30/86.7 splits and 50.2% TS. That's atrocious efficiency and volume for a player that held to an all nba standard.  And honestly the case was the opposite for Siakam last year who was good until january and then fell off after whether it be because of his injury recovery, the time off due the bubble, lack of confidence/loss of touch, etc  Pre-January 2019-20 (27 games) lower sample: 25.1 ppg on 45.7/39.2/81.3 splits on 55.6% TS  January until end of season including playoffs 2019-20 (44 games) higher sample: 19.9 ppg on 43.6/29.9/76.5 splits on 53.0% TS  This is a pretty significant drop off and is on a larger sample size from his start and has carried on into this season where he has done even worse, he can still improve and may possibly get back to prior form, but for now as a max contract this level of play is unacceptable and the eye test checks out too, even his defense has taken a hit. But you have to wonder given the sample size, will he actually get back there and to what extent, pascal isn't very young anymore almost 27 and teams seem to sit on his only one move (spin) aka figured him out"
Jokic and Pascal Siakam come to mind in terms of non-Giannis players.
Not wrong  we are missing Jerami.  Pascal Siakam type jam looking nicer the more I watch us this season.
There was rumor about MPJ and G Harris to Toronto for Pascal Siakam. Is that doable for you guys?
Or Jeff “Walmart pascal siakam” green
"Yes, I said the raptors are better off going for 35 year old cp3 than giannis. Cp3 would actually be a pg and the closer even better than lowry that the raptors think siakam will be lol. A sign and trade of fvv and salary filler for cp3 wouldve been ideal for the raptors. Giannis was always staying in milwaukee, esp after the jrue trade.  Lowry Cp3 Og Pascal Ibaka ( wouldve been retained)"
Want to know the issue? Pascal Siakam playing like absolute dog shit on both ends of the floor. Player’s like OG need Siakam to at least be respectable to keep defenses off balance.  I’m not saying that if Siakam returns to form that TOR are suddenly title contenders but they would at least scrape together a few more wins and might be able to salvage the season.
"Oh Siakam played next to Ibaka and Gasol.. it’s like he’s a PF and those other guys are centers.. wow such sharp observation!   Now you really got me thinking about Blake Griffin playing next to Deandre Jordan or Andre Drummond, and how losing both front court partners that provide so much really really turned Blake into a shell of himself.. but wait that is not how it is at all!  Or unless you’re saying Ibaka and Gasol are actually the Pascal whisper and that he can’t hit open shots without them?"
"He should get used to it. Even if he turns it around he's going to be the scapegoat.  &amp;#x200B;  Pascals struggles are hiding the fact that OG isnt ready to create off the dribble and if you ask him to do much more than sit in a corner shooting 3s and defend its no bueno - but he's 23 so Raptor Nation gives him a pass. I'm predicting he'll get this year as a pass and then people will start criticizing him too (thats when he'll be the age that Pascal ascended)  &amp;#x200B;  Pascals struggles also hide that Matt Thomas has an 111 defensive rating while on the floor which is absolutely disgusting defensively. Terence Davis has a 108 defensive rating. This has allowed Stanley Johnson to play (88 DRTG). Baynes has put up zero points and Len got a few rebounds.      This team has a myriad of issues, Siakam just being the most obvious."
Pascal siakam and the rim
Nah the biggest miss is the departure of MIP/ All Star  Starter Pascal Siakam  All they have now is a Cameroon spinaroon
We also lost Pascal Siakam lol
Anyone but Siakam and OG for me... but he’d be an awful fit alongside Pascal.
"&gt;Both pascal and fvv and og are tradable assets in 1-2 years.  If siakam recovers and finds himself, I agree"
"I feel like Baynes plays his best with a true power forward on the floor with him. The Celtics had Horford, the Suns had Saric (and sometimes Frank). The Raptors have Pascal Siakam."
I remember when Jayson Tatum vs Pascal Siakam was a debate at one point 😂😂😂
"He's been fine. His offense is generating a shit ton of open looks but guys aren't making shots, Powell and Siakam have been terrible, the big man rotation stinks and there are 3 wing defenders on the entire team (Pascal, OG, and Stanley fucking Johnson)"
"I am ""pleased"" to report that Pascal Siakam was not trash today, he was merely mediocre."

Y'all are trash and I mean this from the bottom of my heart that y'all are trash. Y'all are so trash that I want you to know that I'm talking to you. So I'm gonna say you name then I'm gonna call you trash.  Aron Baynes. You trash. Norm Powell. You trash. Pascal Siakam...........Pascal listen to me when I say this. You. Are. Trash.
"People are STARTING to hate on Pascal?     Breh literally every second thread over the past 10 months has been about how Pascal has struggled or like this one, indicating how Pascal's struggles started before the bubble.     People aren't defending him they're just tired of every thread being about his struggles lol.     On top of that, peoples expectations are too high for a young core. FVV/OG/Siakam as a core is young and the reality is that Ujiri needs to get Lowry off this roster because he's making the fans have contender expectations on a team that is giving off every vibe of a lottery team through 5 games."
"I think a lot of basketball fans in general take the extremes too far on both sides of the coin lol.     When Pascal Siakam wasn't struggling Raptors fans were comparing dude to Kawhi Leonard and pretty much making it an assumption he'd be that good.     Now he's going through a period of struggle - I point back to his year where he went 1/31 from 3 for a month. When dude slumps, he sluuuumps.      Maybe he comes out of this one, maybe he doesn't - but either way Raptor fans are doing their best to try and run him out of town."

"Gobert may not be worth his, but the worst contract goes to my boy Pascal Siakam."
"Honestly, the Raptors subreddit was fucking drinking the kool-aid for a bit like we always do with anyone who is remotely good.   However, I think a lot of our fans have come to realize the limitations of Pascal Siakam."
Uh oh. My Pistons drafted Sekou Doumbouya with hopes he would become the next Pascal Siakam!
"i have literally never heard anyone say that. Tatum does what Siakam does with better defence, higher efficiency and as the #1 option. like i said maybe in the finals when Pascal had that crazy game 1 but i can’t think of another instance where people might think that. Also i’m like the biggest Tatum fan on here so i’m biased the other way anyway."
"&gt; Pascal Siakam spoke about quarantining and **going three months without even shooting a basketball**, the longest break he’s had since he began playing the game.  https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/pascal-siakams-3-months-without-basketball-longest-break-ever/"
Pascal Siakam
"the difference in usg% in 19/20 was only 2%, per minute and per possession Khris out-produced Siakam, especially when you factor in efficiency of scoring attempts (61.9% TS on 26% USG for Khris, 55.4% TS on 28% for Pascal - league average was 56.4%), which is reflected in Khris' higher PER. Defensively there is an edge to Siakam but it's not a gap that isn't made up for when comparing their offensive games."
Getting rid of MPJ for Siakam I don't like. I know we suck at defense but that guy is our future. We need more than just pascal Siakam.
"Pascal Siakam doesn't even like being called Spicy P.  He prefers Pskills but everyone says ""lol no you're Spicy P"""
Pussy Slayer or Pascal Siakam?
Why not tank master Pascal Siakam? he seems to be doing the job admirably.
"What's the difference between Pascal Siakam and Kyle Kuzma?  about 32 million dollars a year  Can't believe Raptors fans were adamant up until the playoffs last year that this dude was even on Jaylen Brown's level, let alone Tatum's"
"I kinda view Siakam the same way I did Derozan. Crazy good players with the abilities to accomplish tons. Both are people who embody the spirit of the raptors, most importantly off the court. However both players are likely not those destined to take us to the promised land. I’ll forever support both, but there’s a certain ceiling that has to be accounted for when they’re your teams best player.  With siakam I think he’s lost confidence in his game. It kinda makes sense though. Like has a breakout year where Kawhi takes the heat off of him and he’s typically facing opposing team’s second best defenders. Then Kawhi leaves and all the media hype is “well he can do everything he did before but better now that he’ll have the ball more”. I mean every social media outlet and pundit says so. But now he’s facing better defenders and he’s not able to play off of as many other players. Then when things start to not work it makes sense siakam would blame himself or lose confidence, because everyone is saying he should just be better.  I think ideally, Siakam needs to focus on being the best Pascal Siakam. It doesn’t matter if that’s the best player on a contender, or if it’s being a solid player who can feed off of another star. Realistically I don’t know if he’ll be able to do that, but I hope he can be a long term part of a successful raptors team"
"The problem is part Siakam, but also losing Ibaka AND Gasol.    They used to fade to the corners when Siakam got the ball up top and draw their man out to cover because of their 3 point threat.  Baynes and Len don’t exactly scare anyone so teams are letting them stand alone in the corners leaving 2-3 guys waiting in the paint for Siakam to drive.    Pascal made the right plays tonight early in the game.   Driving, drawing double and triple teams and kicking out but no one could hit a damn 3 until the 2nd half tonight.  It’s also on Nurse too.  We don’t run any set plays for him.  We just pass him the ball at the top of the arc and everyone stands there watching him try to dribble through the entire opposing team."
"I think Siakam is going to look like himself 3/4 into the season again after all have given up hope and drag the Raps back to a playoff spot.   The team is going to be a lower seed, but with a +.500 record after scraping together a bunch of scrappy wins.   Pascal is lacking confidence and the rest of the team needs to learn their roles. I think they’ll find it before it’s too late but the first half of the season isn’t gonna be fun for Raps fans."

I think I figured Pascal Siakam Out.  He gets the worst foul calls on defense and can't buy a foul call when he drives in the paint.  This has effectively discouraged him from doing  what  he does best.
Its funny watching Pascal Siakam attempting to play basketball
What ever happened to my mans MIP Pascal Siakam
Raptors just cant score. What happened to Pascal Siakam that started off last year
Pascal Siakam... assuming I stands for incompetent.
"For me it depends on the cost. If we have to give up both Siakam and OG that’s a no from me. If it’s something like Pascal, Malachi Flynn, Terrence Davis and 2-3 first round picks I agree. But I think they’d want a package like the Pelicans got for AD, the Thunder got for PG. from everything that’s been reported it feels like Houston wants someone to break the bank for Harden. I just don’t see other teams doing it, the Raptors included.   If it were me, I’d let the Rockets wait it out, let Harden continue to ball out for them and run down the time on his contract then try and get Harden for a more equally beneficial deal"
People picking Trae Young?? Really? Brown and Mitchell in the playoffs are proven better.    Booker is elite. Who is Trae Young guarding? BROWN LOCKDOWN D on everyone’s favorite Pascal “spicy P” Siakam in the bubble.....
Cause Pascal Siakam in the first 5 games of the 2019-2020 season was averaging 28/9/4 on 51/44/95 shooting   He ended up averaging 23/7/3 on 45/35/80 on the season. These early stats never really hold up
"As a fellow Raps fan I’d rather keep Siakam. He’s getting a lot of both deserved and undeserved slander here but it’s easy to forget how young and talented he is. He’s not a superstar but he’s still a star player when he plays at the level we know he can. I also think the culture of the team would change without Pascal and trading for Harden would undermine what the Raptors have worked so hard to build, an accountable winning franchise."
Pascal siakam a bum now that the teams worst he’s getting exposed

Which? Pascal or Siakam?
"I mean, I feel like having Siakam is redundant if you already have Pascal, they do essentially the same things."
Pascal and Siakam are good duo. The Raptors should keep them together
"Yeah I agree, though the shut down Siakam part is probably overstated. Pascal was playing like ass even with Mike Chiozza guarding him in the Raps series vs the Nets. Celtics definitely made him look even worse tho lol"

"“So I ask again” lol you actually never asked before.. just kinda made a smart ass comment.   “Money means nothing when discussing who is better” correct but OPs post is asking who would you rather have. Where money and upside are major factors in that.   Now to get to your question, which is different than OPs. HOW IS JULIS RANDLE BETTER THAN PASCAL SIAKAM RIGHT NOW ?   well simply he averages more points, assists, rebounds on significantly higher efficiency. Also has significantly higher VORP and BPM. Also doing this while leading his team who was a projected lottery team too a better record than pascal Siakam who’s team should have been eastern conference contenders.   The only significant edge siakam has on Randle is really just perimeter defense."
Randle turned 26 after pascal Siakam had already turned 26 ... making Randle younger. Yes Ik it’s surprising but you can be born the same year as someone and still be younger.

"Wiseman could be really good next year.   Steph-Klay-Wiggins-Dray-Wiseman could be an awesome 5 that can match up with anyone.  But the best player - as far as I can see - that the warriors could possibly get for that type of package and that fits with our current stars, is Pascal Siakam.  I just think that any trade the warriors make now will be available in the summer so they're probably not in a rush."
"Trae Young.   Also Pascal Siakam.   He's a great complimentary piece to a superstar but he's not anywhere close to being a first option himself.   Despite what Raptors fans tell you, Siakam's game is still incredibly limited."
"Hindsight's 20/20 but Ainge missed hard on drafting the past two years.  If you have your established trio of Tatum/Brown/Smart then he should've been more receptive to drafting older prospects who could've contributed immediately.  2019 - Drafted Romeo Langford and Grant Williams over Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle (hell, they traded Thybulle to the 76ers for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao)  2020 - Traded away Desmond Bane. Saddiq Bey is obviously shining right now but I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt. As an IU fan I have no idea why Romeo Langford was a lottery pick. He's barely played and the best value he'll ever have to Boston is being traded for Harrison Barnes.  Honorable mention - Guerschon Yabusele at #16 in 2016 over literally anybody else (Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Malcolm Brogdon, Dejountae Murray)"

Pascal Siakam needs to stock up on this.
Bruh..... You still on that siakam floater against draymond? That shit was like two years ago. We stay in the present and the present is pascal isn't making clutch shots when we need him. He needs to be better.
"Luka ""Pascal Siakam"" Doncic"
You lost to Pascal “in-n-out” Siakam though
"Pascal ""In-N-Out"" Siakam"
Pascal siakam=Playoff P
Pascal “Brandon Knight” Siakam
"""Jayson Tatum is SOOOO much better than Pascal Siakam""  Oh really? OH REALLY?!?!  jk I love Tatums game and I'm not going to let a couple of meh games convince me he's trash unlike some of these nephews out here"
"Ibaka, Blake Griffin, Zach Lavine, Pascal Siakam. I’m sure there are some more I’m forgetting. I think Rondo has come along way too. You can’t disrespect him and play off like people used to."
"If it were up to me I would trade Pascal Siakam for Michael Porter Jr. and a pick, then send out Lowry/FVV/Norm for a plethora of first round picks and kickstart a full scale rebuild around MPJ"
"That team was deep af. They were honestly a super team   Lowry/fvv  Green/Powell  Kawhi/OG  Pascal/Boucher   Gasol/Ibaka  That’s 3 HOFs (gasol Lowry, Kawhi), 1 all star (siakam) 1 fringe all star (FVV). And 10 legit starters/high end role players on almost any team. Not to mention they had Lin and McCaw on the outside looking in. Absolutly wild  They had size, shooting, defense, chemsitry. They had it all and really were firing on all cylinders."
"Even though it only lasted one season, I would add Kyle Lowry, Kawhi Leonard, and Pascal Siakam to this list."
Pascal Siakam seems really over Norman Powell’s ... shot creating.
"Pascal Siakam	 26	 $29,000,000|$31,320,000|$33,640,000|$35,960,000			 1st Round pick	 $129,920,000"
"After the first Norm miss Pascal legit doesn't run back, Tatum bricks a 3 and then Norm runs back to miss again, the whole time Siakam is camped in the corner trying to catch his breath.   I'm dying."
The logic of “put a C on Giannis” that doesn’t really work applies pretty well to pascal Siakam and I’m surprised more teams don’t do it

It's good to see that Pascal Siakam is regaining the confidence that allowed him to become the FP of the Raptors.
Can someone make a Pascal Siakam apology form?
"Better: Pascal Siakam. He’s pretty spicy this season with quite a few 20 to 30 pt games  Worse: Aron Baynes. No matter how bad you think he is, he’s worse than you think."
Fournette thought he was Pascal Siakam for a second
"For every one time Siakam missed Scottie on a cut, Fred missed about 3. Fred and Pascal had horrendous passing game."
"Fred and OG are the 2 best players, with Siakam as a distant 3rd. Pascal hasn’t done anything this season other than perform against a dysfunction Kings team."

"Not sure how much value you think Turner has. Can’t defend in space, can’t defend in the post. He can block shots and shoot 3’s. Basically Chris Boucher.  Siakam has made All-NBA and started the all-star game. There aren’t many 6’9 guys that can give you 20-7-5 every night and play great defense. If a team wants a player of that caliber, they have to pay up. Otherwise he’s not getting moved. Masai Ujiri is literally one of the best negotiators in the league.

"This is just hilariously foolish. I am impressed.  &gt;what these guys played was crude and underdeveloped, it was not basketball as we know, simple as it is  I wonder, how does the game develop? Could we have today's game if it wasn't for the people who played it before us? If not, who are you to belittle those who helped the game become what it is?  &gt; West literally said they played a different sport, Oscar said his triple doubles can't be compared with WestBrook because he played a different sport  Is a different sport automatically inferior, in your mind?  &gt;media and fans forcefully wants their era to be recognized beyond the pioneer effect, which is something bizarre, a weird kinda of self validation from people who are literally detached with that reality (which is what you just did)  Right, but YOU would *never* have a self-validating attachment to the game in your era, which is presumably the current era? Because you're better than...checks notes...media and fans?  Oh, and I'm not attached to the 50's and 60s'. I wasn't born until the much later.  &gt;There's a huge contextual difference between Wilt grabbing 25 rebounds over construction workers and milkman in comparison to Dwight grabbing 15 rebounds over professionals, what is the logic of saying Wilt had a more dominant performance?  I don't recall saying Wilt was ""more dominant than Dwight."" Pretty sure I said it's impossible to compare players from different eras, in fact. What I took umbrage at was your dismissive tone, and how you seem hellbent on slandering the players of yesteryear by calling them ""amateurs"" or ""construction workers and milkmen.""  For some reason you seem to associate income and athletic training with quality of play, but what proof do you have to support that association? A lot of NBA players come from backgrounds without money or playing experience. Pascal Siakam, for example, didn't play organized basketball until he was 18. Dennis Rodman was a janitor before he started playing college ball.  And there are thousands - *thousands*! - of kids who have the best coaches, go to the best schools, work with elite trainers, study film, etc. - and end up working as insurance salesman or school teachers.  In fact, **the evidence suggests that elite athleticism and/or elite skill are the keys to high quality competition**.  Oh, and like I said, it's never been easier to be a fragile NBA player than it is right now. I'd argue that many of today's NBA players are more emotionally fragile than players from the 50s and 60s, many of whom served in the military (like Paul Arizin). Do you think Marine Corp veteran Arizin would spend time on a burner Twitter or Instagram account responding to fans the way that Durant does, eaten up inside by randos talking trash?  &gt;it's simply illogical to compare the achievements of amateurs like Mikan or Pettit in comparison to any player from the 70s and beyond  You are arguing against something I never said. Comparing players from different eras is impossible for a host of reasons, not the least of which is a wholesale change in the world of professional sports.  But calling Mikan or Pettit ""amateurs"" is disrespectful, and also incredibly foolish. You might want to take a look in the mirror and ask why you think blue collar players from the 50s and 60s don't deserve your respect.  My argument is that the great players of the 50s and 60s are every bit as deserving of accolades as the players of today, if not more so. And it's not because I have some emotional attachment to the ""good old days,"" it's because you can't have today's game (which I love) without them."
Hot take---CJ would be deserving of 0 all star games even if he were in the East. Even the yr DAngelo Russell made it in 2019 Pascal Siakam was a better candidate than either him or CJ that yr.
"If the Raptors traded for Simmons with a package centered around one of og anunoby, Fred vanvleet, or Pascal siakam I would be sad but I would understand.  Masai has taken opportunistic swings before. Everyone scoffed at the kawhi trade too thinking he was damaged goods."
"I dont know about the spacing with Barnes. If I was the raptors, I would concider a trade for Turner and Levert for Siakam. Sab and Pascal could easily make a dominate front court, and Turner and Barnes just makes sense."
Pascal Siakam (on only 8 games sample size mind you) is shooting 41.4% on 3.6 3pt attempts per game.   I know its early and he could go bad anytime. But sometimes it feels like many (including Raptors fans) have locked into his stats from last year and nothing else exists in their mind.  Edit - 41.4 not 41.8
"I think Siakam can play very well and still get traded just for fit/timeline reasons. Something like Pascal for Myles Turner is a downgrade in talent on paper, but fixes lots of issues with the roster."
Then they'll probably round back to the Raptors.  Raptors unwilling to part with Pascal and Siakam
"By the way, it's relatively simple to search it for whomever you'd like. Go to the link I posted above, then click ""Advanced Filters,"" click +Add Custom Filter, change the Field from Player to Team, and enter in TOR.  If you do that, you'll see   OG: 182 DFGA, -3.0% | Scottie Barnes: 232, +4.6% | Pascal Siakam: 94 DFGA, +5.1% (small sample size)  among others. Precious does well in this stat, while Svi and Birch do not."
"Could you get those numbers for OG Anunoby, Scottie Barnes and Pascal Siakam? All the numbers are gonna be not very representative I guess but still would be interested in seeing their impacts."
Pascal Siakam
"As a Raptors fan, I'd take Giannis over KD. Our core would be: Fred VanVleet (27), OG Anunoby (24), Pascal Siakam (27), Scottie Barnes (20), Giannis Antetokounmpo (26).  That roster is absolutely disgusting and would peak at the right time to maintain a dynasty. It's impossible contract-wise and Giannis ain't leaving, but a man can dream. Imagine the ***length***."
Pascal Siakam
"So were the Bucks, but we obviously weren’t actually built for it. Regular season doesn’t matter and as Bucks/Raptors fans it’d be silly to pretend it does.   You’re rebuilding, but keep telling yourselves Pascal Siakam is a #1 option that you need to “retool” around lol. Keeps the East more open for the rest of us."
"I see all star in Erich Paschall. He’s a great athlete in terms of mobility, size, explosion, and strength. He’s got a good handle for a 4 and a midrange jump shot. I basically can see him as Pascal Siakam with a smooth midrange shot. I know it’s not that simple in reality but I’d love to have him on my team"
Scottie Barnes  OG Anunoby  Pascal Siakam  Fred VanVleet  Gary Trent Jr  Precious Achiuwa  Khem Birch  Dalano Banton  Would be the likely list I imagine.
VanVleet    Trent Jr   OG    Pascal Siakam  Scottie Barnes   Precious   Dalano Banton   Birch
"I'm not saying he shouldn't be suspended. I'm pointing out this entire sub hoping/wishing he does.  Literally like 3 days ago, Pascal Siakam got hit in the head in the Kings game and was bleeding profusely down the side of his face and no one gave a shit (probably because he acted like an adult about it and also because it was the Kings, not The King). No suspensions, no ejections, not even a foul called."

"KAT has kinda been balling and minnesota has been looking at least respectable in some of their wins recently, if not downright promising  theres no way minnesota fans would be happy with the returns in a KAT trade anyway.  maybe pascal siakam is the absolute best case scenario.   look what happened with the GSW trade are they happy with that, wiggins+kuminga look amazing compared to d'lo  not that d'lo looks awful, he's just okay and a little inconsistent but wiggins is a super important wing defender for the warriors and kuminga looks like a future monster"

If you wouldn't do Wiggins for Siakam straight up you need to take off your homer glasses for a second. Pascal was All-NBA and an all star just a season ago - let me know when A. Wiggins can do that.

Now its def Morant at the fastest guy, Dearon Fox even if he looks slower this year, Shroder, Ish Smith  SG: Lavine and Jalen Green, Anthony Edward built different  SF: I guess it’s still LeBron, Kuminga kinda looks like he has that quick burst too although we haven’t seen too much of that yet. Josh Jackson was projected to be that type of athlete and elite slasher but he never seems to put it together.  PF: Giannis and his long limb and long strides are just ridiculous  Zion quick burst of first step, he’s not the fastest over the full court length but within like 2-3 of space he can move lightning quick   Pascal Siakam is fluidly fast as well in open court, Draymond has pretty good speed leading fast break and quick burst on his short roll  C: AD, Embiid, Bam.. although AD and Embiid are unicorns just fluidly smooth and fast at their size and weights."
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"Siakam shoots 3s, but defenses leave him wide open and it kills our spacing.  Tbh, I don't think it's remotely a coincidence that our best stretch of offense was when both Scottie and Pascal were out and we ran Fred/GTJ/Svi/OG/Birch"
Fred's stats this season: 19.5/7 on 56% TS  OG this season: 20/3 on 53% TS  Siakam last year: 21.5/4.5 on 55% TS  Not seeing where you think the offensive gap is  &gt; defensive threats  Fred is a much better defender than Pascal right now and last season
"Im so ready to let Siakam go for him. The money works out too.   And mind you, I was never a Siakam hater like other Raptors fan. I just think we have a log jam now with OG Barnes and Pascal like when Boston had Tatum Brown and Hayward."
"Nice foul on Pascal Siakam, I really loved it"
"It means we've been playing bad teams so far. IIRC we've played only 3 winning teams and lost all 3 games. We've beaten the Spurs 3x, New Orleans and Houston etc... our wins haven't been too impressive. We beat Toronto without Pascal Siakam and they are only 0.500."
"Scottie + Precious + Dragic + 1 first + 1 second, I think that's a decent place to start? I think the Timberwolves would be more inclined to accept this trade over others because Scottie is by far the most intriguing prospect they can land. He'd pair well with Edwards and is on his first year in a rookie deal. Precious is a decent rotational piece who can perhaps develop into something more &amp; the two picks give them more depth in upcoming drafts.   If the Raptors were to trade for KAT; I'd rather they keep Siakam over Scottie. If we land KAT we're definitely trying to win now &amp; Siakam is much better suited for that. The two would also make a great front-court together and the Raptors are already defensively fine-tuned enough to compensate for KAT's defensive shortcomings.  A starting lineup of FVV - GTJ - OG - Pascal - KAT with Banton - Khem - Flynn as the rotational pieces seems like a solid 8 man rotation to me."
AD is so versatile he could play well next to Pascal or Siakam
"yeah we were shitting our pants worried that Giannis wanted to go team up with Pascal Siakam in Canada lmao  If Kyle Lowry and Kawhi Leonard didn’t want to stay, Giannis sure as Hell wasn’t going there"
"Yes something tells me pascal siakam could definitely play a part in a championship run, likely as the second or third best player"
I wonder if we’re ever gonna win a game with pascal &amp; siakam
Pascal left   SIAKAM WAS BACK 🔥🌶️
Positives: Pascal left. SIAKAM WAS BACK 🔥🌶️  Negatives: JUST about everything else
"I mean, its only been a year and a bit, tons of current stars didn't look like stars immediately. Some random mid-late first rounder is probably going to win MIP in 2 years and become an All-Star or a DPOY candidate or something else. Would you have projected Giannis or Kawhi to be MVP level players a month into their second year? Guys like Julius Randle, Jimmy Butler, and Pascal Siakam are also good examples of guys who took a bit to become stars. Its not really uncommon for only 2-3 guys to look like stars this early into their careers, nor is it uncommon for 2-3 ""random"" guys to become all-stars later in their career."
"You don't need to play all of them together all the time? That's what you have guys from the bench to do? I don't need to make any changes to the roster, but if you have to I think you have Barnes come off the bench and put Birch at the 5 until Pascal gets his 3 ball back  Fred, GTJ, OG, Barnes, Siakam will be your closing lineup most of the nights they are arguably the best players on our team atm. The key thing is to manage their minutes better throughout the entire game and specifically use Birch and Precious to wear down the other teams centers throughout the games, so that Pascal and OG have easier times down the stretch."
"If we re-draft 2016, where does Ben even get picked?  Hypothetical lottery re-draft:  1. Jaylen Brown 2. Jamal Murray 3. Brandon Ingram 4. Domantas Sabonis 5. Pascal Siakam  IMO these guys all get picked before Ben. Would you guys take Simmons over someone less talented but with fewer glaring weaknesses, like Brogdon or Levert? In a playoff series it's something to consider."
"They both are pretty absurd. I would have traded siakam for Wiggins, thr 7th pick, and either Wiseman or the 14th pick.  Kuminga+wiseman+Moody+Wiggins+picks is pretty crazy for pascal and I think thats a bit too much for him"
There's some interesting trade pieces out there if Minnesota feels it needs to do something significant.  Pascal Siakam won a title as basically the 2nd best player on his team and plays good D.  Ayton stepped up in the post season last year and is not very appreciative of what's happening in Pheonix.
Remember when people thought Pascal Siakam was good? Like... Really good? Remember when people voted him for MVP? That was hilarious.
Lol. Once Khem is back I like FVV-GTJ-OG-Pascal-Birch then go to Barnes-Banton-OG-Siakam-Birch for the first lineup change to play some long ball.
"Khem's out. Scottie's starting, Grange had a bit of a brain fart with his lineup tweet and had us starting Pascal and Siakam lol"
I'd rather have Wiggins than:  John Wall  Russell Westbrook  Tobias Harris  Pascal Siakam  Ben Simmons  Jrue Holiday  Kristaps Porzingis  D'Angelo Russell  Gordon Hayward  List goes on
The people responsible? Pascal and Siakam
"Domantas Sabonis 1st year (20) 5.9 ppg 39% fg  Pascal Siakam 1st and 2nd year (22, 23)  4.2 ppg &amp; 7.3 ppg 50% fg  Julius Randle 1st year (injured) 2nd year (21)  11ppg 10 reb 42% fg  Giannis 1st year (19)  6.8 ppg 4.4 reb  41% fg  Kyle Lowry - didn't avg double digits points or more than 4.5 assist until his 8th year."
"Oh no. That was because he was sent to the G League and then he came back this April and played considerably better for the last few weeks of last season.  He just needed to log into more minutes. Developmental Staff was hired just a few months ago and those kinds of things normally need a year or so to start seeing the benefit, developmental coaches can't work that fast.  One of the best signings we got was the main Raptors developmental coach. The Raptors beat writers were super bummed out. He does a great job in addressing offensive talent if it exists(so great for Kuminga especially). He was solely responsible for raising several prominent Raptor players like  Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby and Fred VanVleet"
Pascal and Siakam are def top 3
Or imagine if it was pascal siakam who kieff threw a dirty play at in garbage time and then siakam defended himself. Raps fans would be calling for his head lmao
Pascal Siakam in the playoffs
"Yeah I think the next FRP the Wiz can trade is in 2024. But I'm not entirely sure. Either way if they were to trade for a third star like Jerami Grant, Pascal Siakam, or someone else, one of Rui or Deni would have to be traded."
The criticism has been insane. There was a petition started by our fans asking for him to get fucking deported. We have some of the worst damn fans in the league.  https://www.opencourt-basketball.com/racist-raptors-fans-start-disgusting-petitions-to-send-pascal-siakam-back-to-africa/
".6. Pascal Siakam refusing to get back on D, box out, or pass"
Dragic will be paired with Pascal Siakam at the trade deadline to trade for LeBron James so LeBron can finish out his career with the franchise he owns.
"Unpopular opinion here, but Siakam would do as well as Pascal if not better if he got some time to gel with the rest of the Raps."
Pascal is starting. What about Siakam?
But would Pascal get called if he tried to post up Siakam?
"Thanks! So excited to have Pascal coming back soon. I'm excited to see how we work with a fully healthy group (except Yuta, unfortunately.) As for Siakam, if we can get him back too? Omg, league fucked."
Hope Pascal comes back strong for y'all. Siakam too!
pascal siakam is only 2 years older than ben but he's already a seasoned championship-winning veteran while simmons is refusing to even play for his team  siakam is also a good shooter
"I agree, Raps can't just rely on Siakam anymore. I wish Pascal and Siakam were both healthy   - Shaq"
Evan Mobley has more points than Pascal Siakam this season for the Raptors so far 👀👀
FVV - Barnes - Pascal - Siakam - OG  The OG at center lineup was great last year.
"I don't even know where we're gonna fit Pascal into the starting lineup, let alone Siakam"
LMA and Aldridge is the new Pascal and Siakam
"The raptors have been completely misunderstood by the entire league. Nick Nurse and Masai's army of long, versatile, defensive players who can switch every position is going to put the raptors in home court advantage in the playoffs.   Why: It's the perfect counter to perimeter defend 3s and the basket. Combine that with hustle and that's a winning formula.   Prior to covid shut down, the Raptors had lost Kawhi and were a good team just figuring out how to be a great team. But, during the shutdown their best player Siakam couldnt find a private court and was uncomfortable with most open courts. His lack of conditioning caused them to lose against the Celtics. (3-5 points in game 7 was the difference and everyone knew something was wrong with pascal).   Come into restart of the season, the raptors had a slow start and then started doing well. At one point from 12th early in the year climbed to 4th in the east. The players for covid and the rest of the season was a wash.   Getting the 7th last spot ensured lottery, but in the lottery they moved up to 4th and picked Scottie."
"November 25, 2017. With 7 minutes left in the 2nd quarter, Pascal Siakam hits a 3 against the Hawks.   December 29, 2017. With 8:33 left in the 2nd quarter, Pascal Siakam hits a 3 against the Hawks.  Between those two makes, he missed twenty seven straight attempts. Pascal Siakam owns that record with the most notable 0-27 three point streak in the 2017-2018 season."
I don't ever wanna hear that bum Jayson Tatum's name again compared to Pascal Siakam. That was absolutely pitiful.
"Just be a 6'9"" unicorn! How hard is that?! See how Pascal Siakam is just in the top 0.1% of athlete's?! Do that!"
Having Pascal back is gonna be awesome. Can’t wait to see what we’re like with Siakam back too
You mentioned Pascal but what about Siakam?
Pascal is returning within the next week and a half so that’s a massive boom.. Scottie should be back before siakam too
"And his brother Pascal ""Pascal"" Siakam"
Can't wait for Pascal to be back with Scottie healthy. Scottie is such a good playmaker that all Siakam has to worry about is scoring. Most ideal role imo.
"Fuck Pascal, fuck Siakam, it's all about Spicy P😤"
You know pascal and siakam are the same guy right?
"Offense they aren't equal yet. OG is a better shooter but this is his first time being featured on offense so he still needs to be set up and get the ball in his spots. Pascal can take the ball from up top and create on his own.  With that being said, I am much higher on OG and think he will be better than Siakam since he's growing into the role fast and trust him a lot more with the final shot than Siakam."
"OG Anonoby, Scottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam, Malachi Flynn, Fred VanVleet, etc…  Wouldn’t say ruined cause i like watching good hoopers, moreso ruined in NBA discussions"
"Not the absolute worst, but the start of a long line of really poor trades and signings. The last time the Blazers had a bunch of young talent they…  Blazers traded:  - Will Barton and a first round pick that became Malik Beasley (&amp; Thomas Robinson, victor claver)  To Denver for: -Arron Afflalo (&amp; Alonzo gee), to replace injured Wesley Mathews.   Afflalo goes from shooting 50% mid range to 39% and injures his shoulder in 2 months. Leaves blazers a few months later in free agency to the knicks. Out of the league 3 years later.   Matthews after tearing his Achilles leaves blazers in free agency for dallas. Comes back from injury, goes on to be a 3 and D journeyman.   Comparable first round picks (#19 and lower) in 2016 included: - Malik Beasley (Por first round pick to Den) - Caris levert - pascal siakam - dejounte Murray - Malcolm brogdon  Will Barton (who was close with Damian Lillard) while suffering from off and on injuries, has gone on to sign multiple contracts with Denver, whether he has been in the starting lineup or coming off the bench he has averaged approx. 14/3/5 (fg 43%/3fg 36%) with just under a steal a game in his 8 seasons with Denver. While portland has struggled to find a consistent figure to lead a bench unit or fill the sf position."
Lmao I was on the same train as you buddy. I made fun of Colangelo for taking Quincy Acy over Quincy Miller. “You took the wrong Quincy ffs”… I actually really liked Acy.   Then it was the time Masai picked some guy named Pascal Siakam and I was livid because he took the wrong Skal! I wanted Skal Labissière… now I just trust in Masai and go with the flow. 😂🤦
"No he didn't, that was the only time he ever made an all-nba team and he was third team. He was at most the 5th best guard that year in the eyes of the voters, had never been at that level before and there was a lot of risk attached.  It's analogous to Pascal Siakam becoming eligible for more money than he deserved because he got voted all-nba third team one time and now both of those contracts are absolute millstones."
rebuilding - look at that championship team - pascal and siakam are the only guys left (OG too but he was out during the playoffs)
Can't wait for pascal to be back. The fact that raptors were the bulls toughest match so far in this season gives me some high hopes once siakam is back.
"&gt;It’s a new season, they’re no longer in Tampa, and Pascal Siakam isn’t available to attempt any game-winning shots that roll off the rim  Lmao, brutal"
"Starting OG or Scottie at center would completely wear them down, can't practically go to that. Don't think that would be good for Siakam either but we might try some Siakam center to sneak GTJ into the starting lineup.  I think it's gonna go, start GTJ and move Scottie to the bench while still pouring minutes into him (he'll happily accept any role and you can keep him to similar minutes) unless Scottie's play just absolutely demands a starting spot (which it has looked like it will tbh).  If Scottie continues to look how he does, GTJ has to come off the bench and he'll venture into trade bait unless he can be productive in that role, our young guys are nipping at his heels as is. His shooting isn't a life saver and we have some offense coming back in Pascal and Yuta too."
Pascal Siakam
I could've sworn the Raptors did the same thing last year with back-to-back rim-out game winners from Pascal Siakam against the Blazers and Warriors.
For real. Pascal Siakam missed the game and they still let our rookie kick the shit out of them on their own floor in his second ever NBA game.
Would that also not make Khris Middleton and Pascal Siakam superstars?
"I'm going to throw a few bullshit names at you, and out of curiosity, (ignoring contracts), who would you 1-for-1 Ben for?  Colin Sexton  Brandon Ingram  CJ McCollum  Jerami Grant  Demar Derozan  Pascal Siakam  Jamal Murray  Malcom Brogdon  Domantas Sabonis  Chris Lavert  Fred Vanvleet  Kemba Walker"
"MIAMI — For a long while, the scowl on Kyle Lowry’s face seemed permanently etched. He used that edginess to rise from meager beginnings in Philadelphia as he scraped for stability early in his N.B.A. career.      “I knew I was good,” Lowry said during breakfast at a hotel here. “I knew I was a starter. But I still had to prove it. I still had the chip on my shoulder. I still had to do this, that and the other. And I still play like that.”      That determination blossomed in Toronto, where Lowry, 35, provided a foundational steadiness across nine seasons, six All-Star berths and a championship in 2019. But all that came only after he fought for court time and was traded from Memphis, which drafted him in 2006, and then Houston during his first six years in the league.      The stage is now set for Lowry to begin the final arc of his playing career with the Miami Heat, who hope that the addition of a veteran point guard with a championship pedigree will launch them back into contention for a title. The Heat journeyed all the way to the N.B.A. finals in the pandemic-paused 2019-20 season, but last season were quickly dispatched by the Milwaukee Bucks.      In the off-season, Lowry signed a three-year contract with Miami worth nearly $90 million, joining a retooled team intent on making Milwaukee’s tenure atop the Eastern Conference a brief stay. Lowry was a prized free-agent target after a midcareer span that made him synonymous with the Raptors.      “We all were mutually agreed that it was time,” Lowry said of leaving Toronto. “It’s hard to put it into words. It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.”      His journey in Toronto started with questions — he was the team’s backup plan after a failed attempt at landing Steve Nash — crested with a championship and ended in a season no one could have anticipated.         ImageLowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.   Lowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.Credit...Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press     The coronavirus pandemic forced the Raptors to relocate to Tampa, Fla., for their home games in 2020-21. Toronto righted itself after a shaky beginning, only for the season to unravel when Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and others missed time because of virus protocols.      “The city of Tampa was great,” Lowry said. “It was just difficult because we didn’t know what to expect day by day. We were in fifth place, fourth place. We hit a Covid stretch and then it was over.”      Speculation swirled over whether the franchise would deal Lowry, who was on a one-year contract. The Heat, among other teams, made inquiries about acquiring him before the March trade deadline.      Lowry had pledged to his teammates before the season that he intended to help them compete for another championship. The team’s dismal record made such a foray unlikely, but Lowry wanted to stay true to his word in seeing the season through.      The adage of sports being a business is a truism. Every so often, the reality becomes murkier.      In 2018, the Raptors and Masai Ujiri, the team’s president, traded DeMar DeRozan, a franchise cornerstone who, along with Lowry, had brought respectability and competitiveness to the organization and was beloved in the city.      Toronto acquired Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs in the trade, immediately won a championship and frayed its relationship with DeRozan. It avoided a potential similar fracturing with Lowry.      “Sometimes franchises have to do what’s best for them, but I was in a position where I had say and I had a little bit, I wouldn’t say power — but I had a little bit of, ‘Listen, it’s not going to be a good look if we don’t collaborate on this together,’” Lowry said. “We all agreed that to be on the same page was the best thing to do, and that was that.      “With DeMar not having the autonomy of having a decision, I think it was just such a different circumstance. It prepared them to not do that to me.”      Lowry finished the season in Toronto and landed with the Heat, anyway. “It’s been really tough for us to see an incredible player like that go,” Ujiri said at a news conference in August. “We knew this was coming. The direction of our team was kind of going younger and Kyle still has these incredible goals.”      ""It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.”      Lowry is one of several point guards, including Chris Paul and Mike Conley, who are still flexing impactful games in their mid-30s, a quality Lowry attributes to better modern knowledge about dieting and training.      “I’ve never been super athletic,” Lowry said with a laugh. “I can dunk and all that, but I still play low to the ground. I’m not explosive. And I know how to not jump when I don’t need to be jumping.”      Lowry saw a role for himself with the Heat, a franchise eager for another championship. He had established a relationship with Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra while playing for him at an N.B.A. Africa exhibition in South Africa in 2017. Tampering investigations concerning Lowry’s sign-and-trade deal to the Heat, along with the one that allowed Lonzo Ball to join the Chicago Bulls, are ongoing, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters this week.      In Miami, Jimmy Butler is Lowry’s primary wing mate after he spent years alongside DeRozan — “Smooth,” Lowry said of DeRozan. “That’s my best friend.”      And of Leonard: “A machine,” Lowry said. “He gets it done.”      DeRozan and Leonard are two of the game’s quieter personalities. Butler, though, is a force, both vocally and on the court. Lowry said Butler often communicates through strings of expletives.      “I partly think it’s to get him going, because he’s got to get himself going somehow some way, which is dope,” Lowry said, adding that “some people can’t take it” and think Butler’s a jerk.      “Nah, it’s just how he is,” Lowry said. “Everybody has different demands on themselves.”      Butler recently told reporters that the team was adjusting to how quickly Lowry got the ball upcourt.      “He’s always looking to pitch the ball ahead and get guys in the right spot,” Butler said. “It’s incredible. It’s a blessing, and sometimes it’s a curse because you’ve got to be in some really great shape if you’re out there in what we call the Kyle chaos.”      One day, Lowry expects to retire as a Raptor. Until then, he expects his former teammates to grow into the roles he and DeRozan once occupied. Lowry, for example, faced criticism for missing shots during the first few games of the 2019 finals. He responded with 26 points, 10 assists and 7 rebounds in the Game 6 championship-clinching victory.      “Freddy, OG, Pascal, now they have to take the interviews, and they have to do all the media. Because I’m the guy who was like, ‘Yo, it’s on me,’” he said, adding: “They have to take the criticism, and that’s what’s going to help them grow. I want them to be the All-Stars. I want them to be the champions again. I want them to get opportunities to create generational wealth.”"
Can’t wait for All Star shooter **checks notes**  *Pascal Siakam* to come save your shooting woes!….wait?
\*Pascal Siakam
"Simmons trade idea of the day:   Sixers receive:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  Wizards receive:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors receive:   * Davis Bertans  * Seth Curry  * Kyle Kuzma  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Sixers 2023, 2027 1sts   * Sixers pick swaps every other year available  * Wizards 2025, 2027 1sts   We know that the Raptors were interested in moving on from Siakam last year (he was heavily linked to the Warriors). We know that the Wizards could use Ben Simmons. We know the Sixers are win-now and want star power.   Sixers immediately say yes to turning Simmons, Curry, Thybulle, Maxey, and picks into Siakam and VanVleet. That's two borderline all-star level players that take them, in my opinion, to the top of the Eastern Conference. VanVleet/Green/Siakam/Harris/Embiid is ridiculous. Fred and Pascal can both shoot well enough, Pascal is of course a do it all wing, Fred can run point, and both play good defense.   Wizards move a negative asset (Bertans), some second-rate youth, and some picks for Ben Simmons. A Beal/Simmons pairing works really well. Simmons can run point and play defense, Beal can play off ball and take all the shots.   Raptors move a guy they've been interested in moving (Siakam) plus a guard in his absolute prime who has limitations to his game and who doesn't quite fit their timeline (Fred). In return, they get a wealth of picks and young players, plus a PG and two forwards who can contribute immediately (Seth, Bertans, Kuzma). They can probably flip one or more of those guys for more assets or a player who fits better. Meanwhile, Matisse is a total Masai player, and Maxey is a decently promising young guard -- something the Raptors lack.    Who says no?"
If you're the third best player on the team and you need a ton of shots to get into rhythm that's probably not a good sign. The best supporting stars are guys like Jrue Holiday or Pascal Siakam who make up for their lack of top-tier shot creation by doing all the little things and being able to finish plays well.
"Sure, but what IS All NBA?  Its a selection of the best players of the year made by sportswriters and media personalities based on whatever criteria they use to vote.  But what does it do besides that? Nothing, it doesn't help you win more, it doesn't give you home court in the playoffs its just an accolade and sportswriters can get things wrong based on bias, narrative, laziness etc. Ben got it, but ""All NBA talent"" is supposed to be metonymy for ""one of the 15 best players in the league"" and Ben just isn't that.  Pascal Siakam made an all star team, but if you call him an All Star talent people balk at you still. He also made All NBA Second team the same year Ben did, 2nd vs. 3rd.   My point is that someone achieving an accolade doesn't mean they deserve the respect of it in perpetuity. Sometimes the voters just get it wrong or a player who deserved it one year stops deserving it in the future.   I think Ben cruised on his hype and uniqueness for 4 years and from now on 16/8/8 with no growth won't be enough to get him those awards."
"Guarding Giannis man-to-man has never looked good for any defender, he demands a herd. But I still feel Ayton deserved that Pascal Siakam, Jaylen Brown type of contract. He hasn't proved more than they did on their rookie deals."
Does All-NBA second team and all star starter Pascal Siakam ring a bell?
"Outside of Bruno Caboclo, we hit on all of our picks even if they were late:  2015: Delon Wright- 20th   2016: Jakob Poetl- 9th              Pascal Siakam- 27th  2017- OG Anunoby- 23rd  2020- Malachi Flynn- 29th   They were good role players at worst"
"Typically, the guys who start late and have success are physically gifted. If you’re an averaged size human it’ll be tough to get your skills up to where they need to be. Other averaged size guys that have been playing since they were 7 years old will have a much more developed skill set.   Guys like Pascal Siakam started playing basketball at 17 and made All-NBA 2nd team at 25. But being 6’9 and a great natural athlete definitely helped him there."
"Pascal Siakam played with Aron Baynes last year who was not only a horrible shooter, but would literally hold hands with his defender and escort them over to wherever the ball handler is to decrease spacing even more. It was his life’s goal to be a “negative spacer” and he played that role perfectly."
"Absolutely not then it wouldn't be somethign that would make sense. Sabonis in my opinion doesnt work for the raptors because he is a negative on defence. Raptors want two way players even if they are not two way players who are super stars. Myles has some offensive game but seems to bring something on the defensive end.  Siakam for Turner wouldn't make sense salary wise and also it would be a lopsided trade in favor.   Picks wise it depends on your front office. Raptors keep picking up guys like OG and pascal in the 20s so picks can be valuable, and can also be used to add to a deal. Dragic because he is a vet and also if you are clearing salary for something he is the one that makes sense if you arent going to reup turner. Really it would be boucher as the asset to play along side Sabonis.   OG is all defensive level year over year over year and frankly is just flat out better. I dont say that as a homer I am not pretending that he is Kawhi like some think.. but yeah. Also Turner is injury prone so that was my thinking.  Hopefully this doesn't come off as contentious."
Pascal Siakam
"Okay for one the locker room incident is extremely overblown. I am from Toronto and that has been smoothed out.  One thing that is absent that you neglect is last season we had no competent centre and we were playing 4 on 5 on offence.  We had an incomplete roster and on top of that this would have been the first time teams actually game plan for Siakam to give some context. From the bubble year to last year in Tampa Pascal never really got an off season to improve.   Now from a number stand point compare Anthony Davis’ numbers last year to Siakam’s numbers. You will find that the numbers are very similar while AD having the luxury as Bron and being the second option whike Siakam was the primary option. Not saying Siakam is better than AD.   This year will be much different in my opinion. I see Barnes being the defacto pg and playing A Draymond type of roll which will allow OG, Fred and Siakam to focus more on scoring as Barnes is a more natural playmaker and his scoring needs work. Also with a competent  Birch or Precious I anticipate a much better Siakam with more threats on offence.   Lastly they’re a lot of players who get paid the money Siakam does and can’t be a championship caliber number one. So I don’t think the contract is as bad when considering we have a proven number two option who has won."
I give Luka   Pg: Luka  Sg: Jamal Murray   Sf: Joe Ingles   Pf: pascal siakam   C: myles turner   Sixth mans : carmelo/ derrick rose.  Base off your criteria and realistic cap space. These players would fit his skill set.
Pascal Siakam just you wait...
"Marc Gasol, Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam…"
"Who is the player everyone knows that everyone agrees is overrated, by the way? Like who are you supposed to say to get upvotes here? Pascal Siakam? Tyler Herro? Ben Simmons? Devin Booker? Domantas Sabonis? Jayson Tatum?"
"Yes, but what you said was that KG was never seen as the better player. You didn’t specify those years. Now you are trying to specify those specific years, when it wasn’t in the context of anything you or I said.   And All-NBA teams disregard team record?   So DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Julius Randle we’re all top 10 players? They didn’t get 2nd team All-NBA for being the beat players on playoff teams?    And I watched the series live too bro, I’m in my 30’s. Good speculation though!  I’ve proven you wrong with your All-NBA takes, and said Shaq being the best player prior to 2002 was pretty much a unanimous thing. However everyone knew he coasted during the regular season and turned it on for the playoffs."
"Serge Ibaka, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green, Kyle Lowry…  Ok nevermind, sixers still might have looked better on paper lol."
Pascal Siakam on the Jazz.
Toronto will blame one of two people depending on how their seasons go: 1) Pascal Siakam: is there friction with Coach Nurse? Is he becoming a diva? Can he stay healthy to earn his contract? or 2) Gary Trent Jr.: we are paying him to be a star and he's just not showing it.
"&gt;Do you think you’ll make a trade? I just can’t actually think you’ll keep young guys like wiseman with aging stars like Step/Klay/Dray.   Lacob and Myers have already said that unless there is a ""star available"" or a ""blockbuster trade"" [that would make them overwhelming favorites] (my words, not theirs), then their goal will be to bridge the gap to the future; contend while simultaneously developing Poole, Wiseman, Kuminga, and Moody.  &gt;wouldn’t a guy that could reach his full potential be much more useful to your team?  More useful now, yes. But useful enough? Possibly, but possibly not depending on a lot of other factors.   Championships are binary. You either win it or you don't.   They shopped Wiggins + Wiseman + 7 + 14 around and got peanuts. They couldn't get Dame or Beal or Giannis.   Blowing your front office load and giving up that much capital to get someone like Pascal Siakam pr Ben Simmons might make them a better team this year, but if that move doesn't net them a championship then what's the point in making the move?   And now you gave up all your pieces and have no leverage to right the ship.  People keep saying ""Everyone trying to be the Spurs"" but I don't think that's accurate. Besides the Warriors I can't recall a team in the modern NBA that has followed the Spurs action plan."
"The criteria in the draft is very few busts and a good number of players who over-achieve considering where they are drafted.  So for the Raptors these are their 1st round draft picks:  Scottie Barnes  Malachi Flynn  OG Anunoby  Jakob Poetl Pascal Siakam  Delon Wright  Bruno Caboclo (bust)  Terrence Ross  Jonas Valančiūnas  So 1 bust in 10 years. Pretty fucking good resume.  All of the players on this list are legit NBA rotation players, and a few have become borderline All Stars.   Pascal was selected 27th overall and is now a #1 option who scores +20-25 ppg, made an All Star Team and was All NBA.  OG was selected 23rd overall and is now one of the most versatile defenders in the league, and avgs +17 ppg and 40% from 3 point range.  And the list goes on.  And this is not including the undrafted talent (Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, REDACTED) that they have managed to find over the years."
"There's half the league that struggles to get good viewership with actual good talents, a G-League team won't get viewership, there have been academy leagues in multiple sports in many countries  It just does not get viewers, the point is to be a farm system and far teams that improve players and ship them to the NBA  Don't get me wrong but who's gonna turn to see Pascal Siakam average 18ppg in the G-League"
"Met Jamario Moon and Anthony Parker after a Raptors/Cavs game back in 2010. I don't remember the whole conversation but they were great for sure.  Same with Alvin Williams.  One of my parents used to work for an airline so would always run into pretty well-known people. Apparently Pascal Siakam and Nick Nurse are total saints. Norman Powell was apparently pretty quiet, but nice enough  Then randomly met Masai Ujiri in Mexico a few years ago, was honestly just like talking to any random person, but in a good way. Just super approachable. He ended up leaving the same day we did, so we saw him at the airport again heading back to Canada. Helped with his family's luggage and whatnot too since we were all going the same way"
What PF/C do you think pairs best with Sabonis if you could pair him with anyone? Is there any forward/big combo you could make that meshes with his strengths/weaknesses? The only one I can think of is Anthony Davis. Pascal Siakam maybe? Maybe Julius Randle? I think that's about it.
Pascal Siakam also screams on every layup. Try watching a Raptors game and he'll maybe refrain from screaming only once a game.
"the Raps had to play 72 away games so it was a lost season already and then they were ravaged by covid, so their tanking is excused, unlike a certain Tornado Alley-based team. also, i was referring to players such as Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby who are all great players the Raptors drafted outside of the lottery or signed after they went undrafted"
"Yeah but they must've had a scouting report on him and knew that he was a reasonable pick within the range. It's not like they had nothing on Mitchell. They looked at his scouting report, knew he would be around that range and decided to take Tyler Lydon 24th and Trey Lyles.  I'm not trying to say something like they could've taken Draymond because he was a second round pick or Pascal Siakam because he was picked 27th the next year. They knew all the data around him, he was reasonably expected to go within their range and chose to take two mediocre players instead.  Of course, you can make excuses about fit with Gary Harris but ultimately, they're not going into a draft without a scouting report on every possible option."
"Not sure why a Siakam trade was ever in play. I bet on Masai everytime. Pascal, Freddie, Gary, OG, Chris, Barnes is a nice young athletic core that can shoot. They ain't marquee names but could easily suprise the east in terms. Likely 1st round exit but exciting to watch."
"Pascal Siakam was called ""Pass on Skal (Labisierre)"" when he got drafted by fans. No one cares about this comparison now."
"I'm not a big fan of on/off in general, since I think it can easily suggest things about a player that aren't true. In the case of the Raptors, there was a stretch where VanVleet, Siakam, OG, and a couple of other guys were all out with COVID at the same time. The Raptors understandably got killed in the games all of those players missed and Lowry's +/- took a hit because of that. I think that Lowry was probably about as impactful as Fred, Pascal, and OG in the minutes he played overall.   Having said that, Fred was a big driver of success for us last season. He can also do many (but not all) of the same things Lowry does and is better in a couple of areas as well. In particular, I think he is a better defensive player than Lowry at this point."
"If you’re team has to bench you at the end of a playoff game because you literally refuse to shoot the ball you’re not a top 25 nba player.   This list is not in an exact order, it’s just players who are better than Simmons.   Ben Simmons sucks  1. Lebron  2. Curry  3. Giannins  4. Kd  5. Jokic 6. Ad 7. Kawhi  8. Westbrook  9. Lilliard 10. Embiid 11. Luka  12. Harden 13. Kyrie  14. Tatum  15. Beal 16. Paul George  17. Trae young 18. Jaylen brown  19. Jamal murray 20. Devin booker 21. Chris paul 22. Kris Middleton  23. Jrue holiday  24. Zach lavine 25. Pascal siakam"
Trading Siakam for Simmons will only lock us on to a treadmill. If we’re trading Pascal I would much rather it be for younger prospects so we can properly tank.
"But they've improved considerably as interest in basketball has risen - that's the point. Look at China's rankings going back 30 years, or many African nations for that matter. The Phillipines used to dominate Asia basketball, now China does. Unlike Embiid and Siakam no one on the Chinese team played prep school and college hoops in the US, which again speaks to the role of development (and the sports culture where you totally uproot your life, move countries, and dedicate yourself just to basketball while still in school). Would Cameroon beat China with those two players? Maybe, but I'm less confident than you - young Pascal +and Luc Mbah a Moute played on the 2013 squad which didn't even finish top 3 in Africa. You ever wonder why Embiid and Siakam don't play for the national squad? They don't want to get embarrassed losing to Egypt and Tunisia. You can put MVP Steve Nash on. The Canada squad and they still struggle to win games against teams with zero NBA players. NBA players are not the only, or even the best, way of measuring a country's top basketball team - just look at Canada in the last round of qualifying."
"I mean all you need is Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka and Pascal Siakam, it’s easy enough"
The OG Pascal Siakam 😤
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
"I’d like to contest this claim actually; not just because of the Siakam thing either.  Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, and Pascal Siakam have all enjoyed far more team success than the Sixers, all three of these teams have made conf finals. Ben Simmons has never led the Sixers to beat a team that was even good, stuck in the second round, and consistently is at the core of their issues. Sure, he made the all-star game a few times and is a defensive juggernaut, but all three of these other guys have displayed just as much all around talent I’d argue, and they’ve all been able to bring it when it mattered the most.   Ingram is ehh to me tho"
"I think the raptors have the biggest draw. The raptors develop anything and treat people with respect.   It's a big city with media stars like drake. Jb and the weekend pulling up from time to time.   Trade Fred vanvleet , since he's a versatile scorer and decent passer avg 6 assist. With Chris boucher , Goran dragic for Phillies draft pics next 2 years and Tyrese Maxey, Isiah Joe rookie too.   I say by November when the raptors have a slow star when they realize pascal siakam isn't the  the first option type of guy but a co star."
"Levert is an inaugural member of the Sneaky Old Club, alongside Pascal ""Older Than Andrew Wiggins"" Siakam and Dame ""Same Draft As Bradley Beal"" Lillard"
"&gt; 2016: Pascal Siakam, all nba in 2020, at worst a great starter. Won a title as at worst the third best player. Top 5 in redraft  I'd easily take FVV over Siakam"
Pascal Siakam
I don't see how the Knicks or pacers are better than Chicago and the bulls had the 12th ranked defense I think derozans playmaking in the half court will allow zach lavine to give more effort on defense and get easier shots    I doubt the Raptors will be the 9th or tenth seed pascal siakam is a 3rd option at best fred vanvleet is solid but I don't think he can get much better and if I'm not mistaken Barnes is a project player who's raw so I don't see him adding much
Pascal Siakam (27) is older than Andrew Wiggins (26)
Pascal Siakam is older than Giannis
"Pascal Siakam, everyone has kind of forgot how dope he was pre-bubble."
"Fred Van Vleet and Pascal Siakam need to prove that they can be the leaders the Raptors will need this season. Not too worried about FVV, I think Siakam will do fine as long as he stays out of his own head."
"There is literally no scenario where we trade Siakam for Ben Simmons. He’s a more versatile player and Ben’s advantage in perimeter defence isn’t worth trading Siakam’s advantage in scoring, versatility, spacing, fit, playing a position that exists, post game, rim protection and whatever else.   Also Pascal was an all star in 2020. It’s 2021 right now, 2020 was 1 year ago."
"I really want everything you say about Butler to be true, but I think calling him a top-5 draft steal of the decade is kind of pushing it when this decade also has players like Rudy Gobert (27), Draymond Green (35), Jimmy Butler (30), Nikola Jokic (41), Malcolm Brogdon (36) and Pascal Siakam (27). That's five all-stars, four of whom are on a trajectory to being in the Hall of Fame, and a *very good* starting PG in Brogdon who is right on the cusp of being like a 15th or 14th all-star in a weaker conference.   I really want Butler to be that good, and I think he definitely *can* be, it's clear he's extremely talented, but I also think that saying he's ""already"" a top 5 draft steal of the decade is **very** premature, especially when you consider that we haven't even seen the first few years of guys who were drafted late in the 1st or mid into the 2nd round in the last couple of years. There might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now, and making a comparison with Butler to those guys who haven't had much of a chance to emerge is somewhat of a leap imho."
"It’s worked of course. Haven’t you heard? It was a three team deal.  Sixers get: Fred Van Vleet, Pascal Siakam, a wolves second rounder  Raptors get: Andre Drummond, a wolves second rounder  Wolves get: Ben Simmons, all of raptors FRPs"
"Blowout trade:   Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Raptors get:   * Tobias Harris  * Matisse Thybulle  * Jaden McDaniels  * Taurean Prince  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts  Sixers run VanVleet/Cury/Green/Siakam/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man. That's a great, well-built roster (better than trying to force Siakam/Harris to play together)  Timberwolves get Ben for their assets, as they desire  Raptors move Pascal (which it's been hinted they want to do) for McDaniels and Matisse, who both fit their prospect profile to a T, plus Tobias Harris to fill in for Siakam -- they can flip him later for more assets. In the mean time, they run Dragic/GTJ/OG/Harris/Boucher with Flynn/Thybulle/McDaniels/Barnes/Precious off the bench. Plus some draft capital to play with"
Pascal Siakam
"Him and Deyonta Davis man, forever the Pascal Siakam draft spot heroes."
I'm hoping for a Pascal Siakam type third year leap.
Imagine E-40 saying Pascal Siakam
"Dude was legit. Little bit of pascal siakam, little bit of sheed."
"Way Overpaid, thats more than pascal siakam or Og Anunoby, even I think jokic(not sure on that)"
"I’d consider Ben the first option just like Siakam was in that season. Shooting aside, Running in transition, making plays off the catch and in the post while carving up open space was like 75-80% of what made Siakam thrive. Even if you remove the threes Pascal took and turned them into post touches, that raptors team would be more than well equipped to take on that skillset"
Holy shit we’d be terrible   Siakam —&gt; Skal Labissière  OG —&gt; Tyler Lydon (who tf is this??)  2018 N/A  2019 N/A  2020 Malachi Flynn —&gt; Desmond Bane   Pascal and OG are our core now. Both guys picked after them were scrubs who aren’t even in the league now. What a difference good drafting does.
Yes but making all-nba team next year doesn’t mean he’ll be all nba caliber for the whole contract(see pascal siakam).  He’ll score more next year with Murray out.
Shaq is going so far off the grid not even Pascal and Siakam will be able to find him.
"lol so u think efficiency matters. timmy took 40 more shots then manu, might as well say pascal siakam should of won finals mvp cause he shot 50 percent from the field compared to kawahi's 43 percent"
Pascal Siakam
"Honestly Raptors could get a nice squad: Damon Stoudamire, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Chris Bosh, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry, Antonio Davis Andrea Bargnani, Jonas Valanciunas"
Pascal siakam maybe
Pascal Siakam is the already proven answer to this question.
Pascal Siakam  He’s good but not as good as advertised. He’ll continue to get better as that first option though
Dude you need to be checked out a t a hospital. Wiggins is way more efficient three level scorer and way better defender. Pascal has beeen mediocre at best this year defensively and Wiggins is getting a little All Nba defence buzz. Siakam also isnt that great a playmaker (offence is run through him) or rebounder. Actually watch a game and dont buy into sportsnet hype (hell...even super homer announcers Leo and Matt have called out his defence alot lately). You are simply wrong Wiggins is the better player (at least right now).
"No matter how much money Masai pays Pascal Siakam, he will never be good."
"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/injuries/_/name/tor  Looks like most of the team already packed and gone lol. Might be a fun ~~game~~ quarter or two tonight if some of the young raps show up hungry...  Edit to save you a click: Hood, FVV, Lowry, OG, Siakam, Pascal, Watson, and Baynes all out tonight"
The Pascal Siakam special.
What about Pascal Siakam?
"it started with losing our entire center depth over one offseason and thinking Baynes and Len would even come CLOSE to replacing them.  Baynes is a fucking pylon that can't finish a tip in at the basket and can't rebound while Len just didn't work out in our system because we rely on a lot of motion offense (he seems to be doing okay in Washington rn).  then covid hit and we lose fred, siakam, OG, etc... all for significant stretches.  Khem dropped into our laps way too late for the season to be salvaged even though he was giving us something we didn't have before which was a competent NBA calibre center.  this was a fantastic development season though.  New Freddie emerged, Yuta, Malachi, Watson, etc... have all shown flashes here and there that they can be good players.  Pascal has largely redeemed himself since he came back from covid protocols.  Just have to build on that next season."
not dissing Siakam at all but there is zero chance he ever reaches westbrook/paul george levels. those guys are hall of fame locks.   WB 1x MVP 2x Scoring leader 3x Assist leader 9x all NBA 9x All Star   PG 5x All NBA 7x All Star 1x Steal leader   Siakam 1x Allstar 1x All NBA 1x Champion.   The Raptors championship window is closed. Clippers are in contention for a ship. the wizards aren’t winning a ship but WBs accolades will always be ahead of siakam. Pascal can maybe return to 2nd team all NBA levels but i believe we’ve seen his ceiling as a player as this time. this is just my opinion and i could be wrong obv.
https://www.si.com/nba/2021/03/24/pascal-siakam-nick-nurse-verbal-exchange-crossed-line  Lol
There was a top thread the other day saying AD is just Pascal Siakam lmao
Fred vanvleet  Pascal siakam  OG anunoby
1. OG Anuboby 2. Fred VanVleet 3. Pascal Siakam
"Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby"
I agree. Pascal is nowhere near AD.  Siakam though isnt too far behind.

Pascal Siakam vibes driving for calls on critical plays
"Pascal Siakam is the most overrated player in the NBA  All he does run around like a headless chicken chasing highlight plays. He simply doesnt play winning basketball. He cant shoot at all, average passer and cant finish through contact. Used to rate him but of late have come to this realization"
"that's obviously not all an argument is - i was just saying that i dont even think AD is a better player than pascal, so i agree that them having similar stats for this season doesnt make siakam as good as him  idk how you managed to be both so dense and so arrogant but you really showed out, thanks for this weirdly confrontational conversation, complete stranger"
for me it's either siakam or pascal
"ok heres 20-25 (im not gonna do 25+) ppg scorers. i was curious so i looked. i think hes better (on offense) than only rozier and grant on offense (and im not even sure). i understand simmons plays a non-traditional role on the sixers, but seth is still wrong imo  List of 20-25 ppg scorers: Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton, Julius Randle, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Ingram, Paul George, Jerami Grant, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Terry Rozier"
"Brad Daugherty has career high of 44 wearing number 43.  Pascal Siakam has career high of 44 wearing number 43  Vin Baker has a career high of 41 wearing number 42  Mike Gminsky had a career high of 41 wearing number 42   Thurl Bailey got his career high of 41 in [this game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198803140DEN.html). He wore number 41 in this season, via bball ref"
The slander against Siakam &amp; VanVleet by our own fans is so unreal.  Real fans remember them 2 specifically carrying us in the 4th quarter in game 6 of the FINALS that brought our franchise our FIRST RING.  The other half just slander them after every game and only highlight their weaknesses. Pascal just dropped 44 and fans were attacking him for missing a shot in the clutch. Pathetic.
Pascal Siakam syndrome
"They don't give out all-NBA for two months of work, except for Westbrook and I guess for  Pascal Siakam lol"
"I get that he's our ""star player"" and everything but I absolutely HATE when the game winning/tying shot is a 3 and we give it to Pascal.  He is NOT a good 3pt shooter!  Give it to Fred, Trent Jr, Boucher, just about anyone but Siakam.  He will brick it 9/10 times."

I’d rather see the games end with actual basketball plays and not intentional fouls as robin lopez and pascal siakam trade free throws. Maybe I’m crazy
"It's honestly because of homer fans like the one above that when he performs well, they compare him to the likes of tatum and etc. But when siakam fall short of expectations, they do mental gymnastics like acting pascal is turning the corner.  They don't want to criticize siakam fairly for his shortcomings and flaws but rather babying him hoping he returns to that level by magic. Gotta be realistic that siakam may not develop into that first-option but rather he's the perfect pippen role to a superstar."
"Fred just isn’t the best playmaker. To the point where Pascal has legitimately been better than him in that department this season.  And he spends so many possessions isoing for 2/3rd of the shot clock, before dumping the ball off to Siakam and forcing him to come up with something.   It’s part of the reason that developing Malachi is so important, when we lose Lowry we are going to need someone to pick up slack in playmaking, and it will not be Fred."
I love Pascal Siakam
there's not a single fucking person i trust less with the final shot than Pascal Siakam
"“The biggest thing is he’s a super-positive guy,” Nurse said ahead of the NBA All-Star Game in February. “He’s the guy sitting next to me when I’m sensing disaster going on in a game and he’s saying, ‘We’re gonna win, we’re gonna come back.’ Constantly, ‘We’re gonna do it, we’re gonna come back.’ And that helps me out quite a bit.”  Kyle Lowry, who can be harder to please, was succinct in his praise.  “I would say he is the fucking man,” Lowry said.  ""Nate is the [expletive] man,"" said Raptors guard Kyle Lowry. ""He's always that positive, happy go-lucky [guy], always looking at the plus side, not looking at anything negative. We need that.""  Lowry is not alone. Fred VanVleet called Bjorkgren “one of the best” and called rumours he could head to Indiana “well deserved.”  ""I think Nate's fun,"" said Raptors forward Pascal Siakam. ""I hear him all the time in my ear talking about something. Every morning he'll say hi to you and give you a dab. He's present and I think his energy is felt and needed on this team. He's a great guy to have, a great coach and somebody who is a likable person and so serious about his job.""  u think people here just made things up and ran with it? lol"
"&gt; Not at all. Pascal Siakam was MIP and second team all NBA. Devin Booker will be neither. Kyle Lowry wasn't considered their best player, Siakam was. CP3 is considered the Suns best player and leader. This could be bias but the difference in perception matters.  Yep, that's true. It's moreso that there was a misperception about who the best player on the team was last year (it was still Kyle), so the all-nba went to the perception. But at the same time the team had very even strength among its top seven players, so we were performing not really off the back of one player."
"Not at all. Pascal Siakam was MIP and second team all NBA. Devin Booker will be neither. Kyle Lowry wasn't considered their best player, Siakam was. CP3 is considered the Suns best player and leader. This could be bias but the difference in perception matters. Also, CP3 joining the team turned them from a 10th seed to a first/second seed. Completely different circumstances. Only similarities are point guard. CP3 also is shooting way better than Lowry did while turning the ball over way less."
"I mostly agree, but this battle he's been having with Siakam all year is a slight cause for concern regarding Nurse's job security.  Pascal Siakam is not a star, but he's a really good player, and teams will often choose star player talent over a coach, if they have to choose."
"Some recent ones that I could think of are:  Draymond Green - $915,243 in 2015  Pascal Siakam - $1,544,951 in 2019   Not really comparable to the high value Kawhi but both had significant value for their championship teams."
"Pascal I trust with the final shot, Siakam I dont"
"Fred Van Vleet, in association with Serg Ibaka, Marc Gasol, Pascal Siakam......pretty much the entire Raptors roster minus Danny Green who was guarding Klay. Steph hasn’t been guarded consistently one on one since KD got hurt."
"If Lowry is moved the lineup will be: FVV, Gary Trent Jr., OG, Pascal, Khem Birch.  I'm anticipating a lot of changes this offseason though, I think it will be more than just Lowry, I expect FVV and Siakam to be high possibilities for trades."
Pascal Siakam
"The problem is the league has had an influx of talent the past few years, and people can't separate that just because a ton of star caliber players enter the league in a short period doesn't mean Westbrook is a washed up bum because some of these young guys surpass him, while some of the other top players from his MVP season like Curry, LeBron, Davis, Durant, Kyrie, Butler, Dame, etc. haven't really fallen off.   Just since Westbrook's MVP season, we've added Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, SGA, Zion, and Ja Morant through the draft. Combine that with other rookie contract guys from his MVP season like Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray, Domantis Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Towns, Embiid, Lavine, Capela, Oladipo, Jokic, Giannis, and Gobert all developing into star level players."
"Hey Aydee, how does it feel to be penetrated by Pascal Siakam and his 🌶 P? Can you give its affect on your 🍑 on a scale from TacoBell Fire to the Carollina Reaper."
That's where Pascal Siakam played college ball. Is he the best player to come out of your state?

DAMN PASCAL AND SIAKAM BOTH BALLIN OUT TONIGHT!
pascal siakam is a tier below pg my guy.
"Pascal Siakam is exactly the kind of player that Rudy Gobert could guard, wym."
It’s exactly like Embiid except that Embiid is incredible at switching on guards and even guarded Pascal Siakam for a whole series so it’s actually nothing like it lol.
Raptors fans and pascal siakam
Tobias Harris and Pascal Siakam.
@pascal siakam needs to watch this lol
"Definitely pascal siakam, everyone is on him when he plays bad but when he does good everyone ignores it"
"He's having a good year, seemingly right in line with or better than his best year everywhere but 3P%.  If they can get another Pascal Siakam-level player then they can swap #1/#2 options back and forth, with FVV going nuclear every few games too."
ben simmons and pascal siakam
"Tobias played 55 games with the Clippers that year. Siakam played 60 games last year when he made 2nd team All-NBA... I guess Pascal Siakam's season last year was a fluke since it's hard to judge off such a small sample size and it's ""not something you can base too much of a judgment on."""
"Who is better, Siakam or Pascal?"
Its of course a balance... but youre talking about trading franchise player caliber prospects for a few years of Pascal Siakam.   It would make the Jimmy butler blunder look like child's play
"Pascal Siakam, Jonathan Isaac or Larry Nance Jr."
"He’s been often compared to Tatum, Brown, KD, Giannis, Draymond, Biyombo (before pascal got really good), and Ingram. Really any guy between 6’6-6’11 who can at least kind of dribble, you can rest assured Siakam has been compared to him."
"yes, the whole team was good. kawhi + raps was better than the kawhi clippers last year. but its not like pascal being the 3rd best player on a championship run easier than most solidifies him as a star for years to come unless he keeps performing at or near that level   he peaked that year offensively and its yet to be seen if he can get back to that level. his ppg went up 5-7 after kawhi left but his efficiency fell off a cliff from 60efg to 50, below league average this year and last  saying “he won a chip 2 years ago” and disregarding how much worse he’s looked since kawhi left is a laughable reason to call him better than tobi  i was super impressed watching siakam in 18-19 and he looked like he was gonna be a star. but the last two years haven’t given anyone much hope for that"
"Weird how he could carry Pascal Siakam and Kyle Lowry to a championship but not Paul George and Patrick Beverley, hmmm..."
*Pascal Siakam
Who’s pascal? I thought we were talking about siakam.
I hope FVV can do better than 4 for 17 fg and Pascal siakam can do better than 2 for 16  Thats just bad
Siakam is averaging 25.6/4.6/6.5/1.1/1.0 on 49.5/31.4/86.2 shooting in the month April. This includes tonights game.   https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/3149673/pascal-siakam
[https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/\_/id/3149673/pascal-siakam](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/3149673/pascal-siakam)  Also he is not a big wtf??? Its clear you just dont watch us and want him to look bad
No no. We hate siakam and love pascal. Pascal would never play so badly unlike siakam
"He's better than Siakam right now lol. Obviously can't playmake like Pascal, but he's better on defense and his 3 point shooting gives him a huge leg up on Siakam too"
"For all the missed buzzer beaters and hate online you may have missed it but Pascal Siakam is back to being a fucking problem for opposing teams. He’s found a better balance between defence and having to carry a scoring load both at very high levels, his playmaking has taken a HUGE leap and his three has really started to come around again."

"Raptors were fined for misreporting injuries, albeit minor ones.   &gt; “The Raptors were fined $25,000 for the Friday game against the Orlando Magic in which Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam were listed out for rest.  &gt;The Toronto Star’s Doug Smith explained the fine wasn’t simply due to the rest, but because after the Raptors had listed the three as out for rest, head coach Nick Nurse said Anunoby had knee swelling and Lowry was dealing with a chronic foot infection.  &gt;Because of that discrepancy between the injury report and Nurse’s pregame remarks, the team was fined.”"
Siakam has been great. But what's your opinion on the play of Pascal?
"Despite having an inclination to dislike Pascal as a player (the “Siakam over Adebayo” takes drove/drive me crazy), I think it’s a bit too soon to say he’s hit his ceiling when he’s as young as he is. Toronto is a bad team right now, even though they should be better than they are (on paper). I think it’s a down year for them. How much of the blame should go on his shoulders, I’m not sure. But I think it’s too early to give up on his development."
"But would you give him the Rookie-Supermax extension and if yes at all-nba 3rd, 2nd or 1st team?  Teams have to be wary after the all-nba 2nd team Supermax escalator royally screwed the Raptors with Pascal Siakam."
What are your thoughts on pascal siakam?

"Did you even read the article?   &gt; Bruce Arthur of the Toronto Star reported the Thunder ""asked for Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, and four unprotected first-round picks as a starting point for Paul George.

Bruh Pascal Siakam might be the worst pick setter of all time... Dude needs to watch Draymond highlights of setting picks
I have no opinion on the MVP race but if De'Aaron fox wants to go on a 13-0 win streak and average 40/10/10 for the rest of the season or Pascal Siakam wants to turn into a KG/Dirk hybrid that would be fun.
"We haven't underperformed expectations because of KP though. You can pretty much thank Covid and the league not postponing our games for that. Development is also there, he has a career high in efficiency this season and is looking better in the roll all the time. Pascal Siakam is on a similar contract giving similar production this season on a much more underperforming team and nobody is hating on him."
"Amen.  Pascal has been so inconsistent this year, but I really do believe that a lot of that is due to having no decent big man to play alongside of.  Maybe if Nurse had played Serge more than Gasol in the bubble playoffs, Siakam might have had a better-than-putrid series against Boston.  Serge's skillset at center is a perfect complement to Siakam at power forward, but that's all history now."
Yeah the Pascal Siakam that was the 2nd best player on a championship team. Not that Knicks fans would know anything about winning lol

Pascal and Siakam
I hope so. It is not fun with the Pascal Siakam shit this year
"Would you take Brandon Ingram over any of the following: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Pascal Siakam, or De'Aaron Fox? Didn't even bother including Ben Simmons or Jayson Tatum because BI isn't in the same convo add those two.  I feel like Ingram doesn't have that 2nd skill that you point to when his shot isn't falling. All of the other guys are able to impact the game outside of just scoring. I feel like the hair trigger answer might be Siakam, but I feel like even his scoring ability has more layers than just contested jumpers.  I just wonder if the Pels are risking mediocrity by trying to make Zion and Ingram work just because they maxed him already."
"Pascal Siakam $136m for four years. Same situation as KP; good second or third guy, not a franchise player, but he'll have a cap hit of $38m in 2023/2024."
Pascal Siakam. He rose from late first round draft pick to All Star and 2nd All NBA. Plus his dad is dead just like mine and I love how he honours him so much.
Who sounds exactly like Pascal Siakam.
"People say that Pascal Siakam isn't a star, he checks those boxes.  Maybe we should be more discerning."
"I’ll compare Fred’s numbers with Siakam’s numbers in the 2019 run:  Fred Vanvleet: 19.6 PPG,  6.3 APG, 1.7 SPG, 0.7 BPG, 1.8 TOV, 39% FG, 36% 3P on 9 attempts, 41.6% eFG, 23.2 USG%.  Pascal Siakam (the 2nd-option): 16.9 PPG, 6.9 RPG, 0.9 SPG, 0.7 BPG, 47.0% FG, 36.9% 3P on 2.7 attempts (went down to 27% in the playoffs), 1.9 TOV, 59.1% eFG, 20.7 USG%.  From here: Vanvleet has more points, steals, and better 3 point shooting when considering volume. Equal blocks, and lesser turnovers. Basically the only thing siakam was better at was shooting efficiency, which he benefited from Kawhi’s gravity. Vanvleet doesnt have that same luxury. Keep in mind they also have similar usage rates. Vanvleet is on par with 2019 Siakam, who was our second option."
Pascal only shoots 30% on 5 attempts and is 28% from the corner. Joel is a better shooter but attempts less and still only shoots at 32%. Both bigs games revolves around sizing up and Siakam has a worse post game than Embiid. Add in Tobias and Thybulle not being good 3 point shooters too and the court becomes smaller than it already was.
"Well he jumped from 10.6 to 15.9 PPG last season. And went from 7.0 to 10.6 the year before. So he has been improving consistently. And also, he’s 23. Thats still very young. Just to compare, fellow teammate pascal siakam went from 7.3 to 16.9 PPG when he turned 24 and continued to improve afterwards. Another teammate (Vanvleet) has been improving since he turned 23 and hasnt looked back. In fact he dropped a 50 bomb last season. These are all guys who are under the same system and have similar approaches to their attitudes, so i cant see why pascal and fred can be on that 2nd-option level but OG wont be."
I can somewhat see him reaching pascal siakam level. He really improved offensively this year.
"Ben Simmons, OG Anunoby, Scottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam, Khem Birch"
"Recent all-stars I definitely prefer Ben Simmons to:  Kemba Walker, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Domantas Sabonis, Khris Middleton, Russell Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, Julius Randle, Nik Vucevic, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell"
I would happily take Pascal Siakam if I am the Sixers.  I'd even facilitate it however I could.
"He isn't disgruntled, he literally spoke out about this:  &gt; Was there any irritation from you toward the Raptors that your name was surfacing so much in trade rumors?  &gt; It didn’t bother me really, because I never really heard anything from the Raptors. Even all the news I was seeing it was never like: “Oh. The Raptors wanted to give up Siakam for this.” It was always like, “The Warriors like Pascal,” or it was always, “The Kings like Pascal,” or this. There was never nothing where it was like, “The Raptors wanted to give away Pascal.”  [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/sports/basketball/pascal-siakam-toronto-raptors.html)"
&gt;Fred VanVleet: All-Star  :D  &gt;Pascal Siakam: Average Starter  D:
"I agree that we may not jump into the top 10 offensively, but I definitely see a pathway to getting a top 10 / top 5 defence. There’s addition by subtraction defensively by losing Baynes, you slide Boucher over from Center to power forward which lets him be more of a Giannis type roamer defensively and you get OG, Fred and Pascal all guarding 1 position smaller again.  If you start FVV/GTJ/OG/Siakam/Birch, you then have Flynn (who was already an average defender in his rookie season that has upside there), Watanabe and Boucher who were all solid defenders off the bench last year. There are question marks around the young guys but if Scottie Barnes can be RHJ from 2019-20 for us at minimum, that’s another plus bench defender. That’s 9 solid to plus defenders on that team (I’m higher on Wainright than most, I think he’ll be another pj Tucker-esque player but I’ll leave that alone until he proves it)."
If we lose Pascal does that mean Siakam still on our team?
"Marcus Smart borderline all Star, Pascal Siakam average starter.   Ok 538…"
"&gt;  Suggs had a lot of limitation skill wise going into the draft, like can’t finishing left, suspect handling and footwork, shot poorly at the rim. Most draft Twitter projects him to be a Kevin Huerter type second option if he develops right.      Not sure where you're reading that but I don't think that's particularly accurate. Just because Suggs is not a pure PG doesn't mean he is a Huerter type.       &gt; And Scottie was projected to also be a secondary option in a Draymond/Pascal kind of way.       Barnes doesn't come close to the scoring ability that Siakam has. It would be extremely unexpected for him to get to that level.      I think he could be like Draymond offensively, but I really think with Draymond its important to remember that he has been in the best possible situation for his skillset playing with the 2 best shooters/off ball players of all time. I think if Draymond had ended up on another team he might have been putting up like 10/3.5"
"Pascal Siakam will have a “comeback” even though he averaged 21-7-5 with great defense. That was considered a down year for him, so if he has an “up” year he should look great. If his 3-pt % climbs back up and the Raps look competitive again he *should* be in the convo for all-star again."
"Pascal Siakam for Kawhi Leonard?   P - if you're reading this, I'm sorry and I still love you."
"Little being a solid role player is all I'm hoping for. MIP would probably be too much to hope for. If Little became MIP level that would mean we magically gained a young athletic 2 way wing on the roster, which would make Portland a championship contender. If he really did turn into our own MPJ or Pascal Siakam that'd be awesome but I don't think he'll be that good."
"&gt; Basically another Scottie Barnes, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam type.   Except those guys were all high regarded high school and college players and Alex got on low D1 college offer.  Body type is something, but having high level skill and effort is another."
"""Raptors got their man"" jokes aside, Alex Antetokounmpo is a 6'8"" small forward with a 7'2"" wingspan. Basically another Scottie Barnes, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam type. We really are going all out on position-less basketball at this point aren't we?"
Lmao coming off a championship as a 2nd option as a 24 year old the entire league would’ve maxed Pascal if they could. Gordon was coming off no such accomplishment. Don’t ever compare the two lmao. Siakam was All-star starter and All-nba 2nd team the first year of his contract and then last year he got Covid. He’s 100% worth his money in today’s league.
But why did Toronto give pascal siakam so much? He’s not worth $100 million over the next 3 years?
"Raptors  Pascal Siakam for Vince Carter,"
"Absolutely. I’d take current Kawhi over Pascal Siakam, not to mention 2019 Kawhi."
"I come to r/nba to escape the hive mind insanity.  I don't blame anyone though it's just how the internet works.  Pascal has a bad game and you address it just to vent a little but it always  snowballs and people pile on and it gets ugly and personal with one comment trying to one up the previous.  After the championship, personally, I will never say anything negative about Siakam, FVV, or any of the guys on that roster."
"Its absolutely his fault if he has shown zero growth in 4 years. Players sign speculative contracts all the time. Pascal Siakam gets murdered for not developing into a true no. 1 option after signing his Max, but Ben gets a pass because elite defense?  Ask anyone who was involved in signing him, are you comfortable with these exact splits for the remainder of his career at a max salary? I doubt they say yes."
"The article quotes him as saying   &gt; It didn’t bother me really, because I never really heard anything from the Raptors. Even all the news I was seeing it was never like: “Oh. The Raptors wanted to give up Siakam for this.” It was always like, “The Warriors like Pascal,” or it was always, “The Kings like Pascal,” or this. There was never nothing where it was like, “The Raptors wanted to give away Pascal.”"
"Shaq is a gold mine. ""Shaq you got your eye on Pascal?"" ""No I've got my eye on Siakam"""
Ignoring the rules to make fun of Perkins.  “Russell Westbrook is a top 10 player in this league!”  “Pascal Siakam is a top 10 player in this league!”  “You don’t know basketball Max!”  Cue Max easily listing 10+ much better players.
"You really think Toronto is better than Atlanta going into this season?Vanvleet/OG/Pascal are good players but they've lost a lot of the pieces that made them a contender in 2020. Lowry of course, but also Norm, Ibaka, and Gasol. Replacing them with Chris Boucher and Gary Trent is fine, but even with Lowry, Ibaka, and a better year of Siakam that team had a shot creation problem which they have yet to address. They should be a playoff team but I'd move them at least a tier down."
"Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Pascal Siakam, FVV"
"It wasn’t though… where are you getting that from? And I love Thad but people are acting like we Pascal Siakam lol.   We had a backcourt of White/Lavine/Satoranksy now we’ve adding Lonzo and Caruso. Got better there. We don’t have rim protection yes but overall we’ve improved on paper. And offensively, no matter what you think of DeRozan signing, he’s replacing Markkanen and Valentine. That’s a big upgrade. With Vucevic, he came in and the team clearly was learning how to play through him plus Lavine got covid. We haven’t seen near the best of him in CHI.   Not making the playoff means there are 8 teams more talented than us and there is not. So again, if we don’t make the playoffs it’s a huge failure. Either injuries or Billy Donovan should be fired."
I'm gonna get downvoted to hell but fuck it! ... Pascal Siakam.
"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons.

Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
Pascal Siakam
"Maybe it’s because this sub is r/Raptors2, but Julius Randle is better than Pascal Siakam"
1.	Jaylen Brown 2.	Jamal Murray 3.	Ben Simmons 4.	Pascal Siakam 5.	Brandon Ingram 6.	Domantas Sabonis 7.	Dejounte Murray 8.	Fred VanVleet 9.	Malcolm Brogdon 10. Caris LeVert 11. Jakob Poeltl 12. Buddy Hield
I would go with either Jaylen Brown or Jamal Murray or Pascal Siakam
"1. Ben Simmons  2. Jaylen Brown  3. Domantas Sabonis  4. Brandon Ingram  5. Pascal Siakam  6. Jamal Murray  7. Malcolm Brogdan  8. Dejounte Murray  9. Caris LeVert  10. Buddy Hield  11. Fred VanVleet  12. Malik Beasely  13. Jakob Poeltl  14. Alex Caruso   I understand that this may be controversial so please enlighten me on how I'm wrong, but please keep the Ben Simmons slander to a decent level. We can't just pretend he isn't a great player."
"I don’t see the case for Murray over Siakam. Pascal has an all-star start, all-nba 2nd team selection and championship ring as a top 3 player on that 2019 team. Even this past season in what was widely considered a “down year” for Pascal, he scored and assisted at essentially the same rate as Murray, and while Jamal has an advantage in terms of efficiency, Pascal’s massive advantage defensively leaves no room to argue for Murray."
"Yes, I think he still is number 1. Failing to meet expectations doesn't mean he's fallen so far to be 2nd to any of the other guys in that draft.  The only player that I would consider being a better pick than Simmons is Pascal Siakam, but we'll still need to see if he can keep developing beyond where he is now. Don't forget all of the key players in this draft are **still** getting better each season. There's not a front office in the NBA that would think a straight trade giving away Simmons in exchange for Sabonis, Ingram or Brown makes sense. Simmons is still more value than any of them."
"Game 6 2019 finals, Raptors have the ball up 1 with ~11 seconds left.  You'd think the Warriors foul and send someone to the line to hit their free throws. The play's set up for Danny Green to pass to Pascal Siakam, however he throws a horrible pass that barely hits Pascal's hands.  Warriors get the ball, Ibaka has a decent closeout on Steph, and the Raptors get the ball and have free throws to ice it.  That could've gone worse for Danny in more than 1 way if that shot hit."
"It's what Toronto had to do and still has to do. Masai is currently going after a lot of international talent too. Even after all the recent success the Raptors had cumulating in the 2019 Championship, they still struggled to attract quality talent through free agency. They immediately bled out more than just Kawhi after winning.  Most teams aren't top tier free agent destinations, but Toronto is the only non-American team. You here players talk about it all the time with things like having to deal with the border and customs. In terms of running an organization it doesn't get much better than what Toronto has been doing. Sustained success all the way through. They've helped players who were bouncing around like Lowry develop. They've helped develop a ton of young talent like Fred, Pascal, OG, etc. Their assistants and staff keep getting picked up by other teams. They are well run, but they still were never an attractive destination.  So you see it now with Masai going after players like Achiuwa and Mykhailiuk to add to players like Siakam, Boucher and Watanabe. When Coleangelo went out and got Garbajosa and Parker (American, but was playing outside the NBA), it helped propel the team to the playoffs."
"De'Aaron Fox, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Brandon Ingram, Pascal Siakam, Karl-Anthony (take note, OP) Towns.  The underrated starting 5."
"Not sure about other teams, but 2016 was pretty big for the Raptors.  - 9th overall: Jakob Poeltl (traded for Kawhi Leonard)  - 27th overall: Pascal Siakam  - Undrafted: Fred VanVleet"
Pascal siakam.  There are rumors he has a bit of an attitude and he has been struggling recently.  It’s all rumors and the raptors denied but who knows.
Demar Derozan earned a 2nd team all-nba in 2017-18 with a line of 23/3.9/5.2 on exactly league average TS.  Your first instinct might be ok those are not great numbers for a 2nd team considering his awful defense. And you would be right.   You might then think but wait they won 59 games so even though Zach Lavine has put up almost identical numbers (2019-20) and NOT EVEN MADE ALL-STAR much less All-NBA that hw must have been indispensable on the court.   Wrong again. Demar had a negative on/off even this season and the NBA roster featured a whopping 10 PLAYERS who are significant rotation players even now 4 years later.  Here is the list:  OG Anunoby Demar Derozan Serge Ibaka Kyle Lowry Jakob Poeltl Norman Powell Pascal Siakam Jonas Valanciunas  Fred Vanvleet Delon Wright  Of course this team was one of the best in the NBA with a 10 man rotation like that!
Pascal Siakam is a top 10 forward in the league.
I’ll take pascal Siakam or Jaylen brown over those 2 turds
"Active but overrated for his career, easy Melo.  Great, he can get a bucket 1-on-1 when you need one.  But he's not an especially efficient scorer.  His defense sucked.  And he doesn't make his teammates better.  He's basically an average player who took a lot of shots relative to other average players.  Maybe he'd be some sort of stud in pick-up or on the streets.  But in the NBA, he was nothing special.  Currently overrated I'll say Pascal Siakam.  His 2018-19 was very solid.  But he's plateaued at best, if not taken a bit of a step back now that defenses have taken his 1 move away.  His scoring is up thanks to more attempts but his rates are down.  The idea of what he could be is exciting, but his impact is notably less."
"It has nothing to do with race but how much easier it is to fabricate documents in Africa because of corruption. I don't know what it is you're having difficulty understanding. Just like passports can be fabricated, in some countries, it's easy to fabricate your age and name. In some countries, it's easier than others. In America, good luck fabricating your passport. Also, learn to read, buddy. I never said Africans didn't have documentation. I stated that there is a lack of PROPER documentation.   When did I say European and Asian players don't lie about their age? They do. It just so happens that there have been more cases with African players involved. What statistic did you even provide? Oh, because you and 'everyone' you know have it, that means everyone has it? I guess you represent 1.3 billion Africans, then.   Xenophobia has nothing to do with claims that someone might be older than they are. Xenophobia is when you dislike someone of a different country. Does anyone here hate Steve Nash? Did the league hate Hakeem? What about Dikemba? Pascal Siakam is from Africa. I guess they hate the guy so much.   You don't make any sense. None of what you said is 'statistical' at all. It's more prevalent in Africa which is why FIBA banned Nigeria for two years after finding that some players on their team fabricated their ages. Kenya's national U-17 team was dissolved by the government after some players admitted to being over age. Ben Koufie, former president of Ghana Football Association, said in 2012 that the problem has been bad for a long time and that is was common when you asked a player about their age, they will reply whether you are asking for their football age or actual age. In April 2013, nine players were excluded from the African U-17 Championship in Morocco after they were caught being over the age limit. Later in 2013, Nigeria lost several players for the FIFA U-17 in October for the same reason. Somalia was expelled from qualifying for the 2013 U-17 Championship for having overaged players on their team.   Excerpt from someone who is heavily involved with the football association in Africa:   ""Junior Binyam, the Confederation for African Football's (Caf) media director, agrees age fraud is a problem in Africa because countries do not have a reliable database to track ages.     He said: ""It is easy in many countries to change ages or 'amend' those registers. It is not rare to find people with more than one birth certificate.   ""In some cases, when the player changes identity, he can, most of the time, be registered as a new player. The fraud on ages then affect the development programs if the players involved in an age category are not really from that category.""   With a shortage of legal documents to clarify ages in Africa, Koufie believes confusion could be one reason for so-called age fraud.   When asked about Ghana's Under-17 World Cup win in 1991, he admitted some of the players did not know their real age.   He said: ""In Africa, many people don't know when they were born. Sometimes they guess. It is true we have problems in Africa, that is why we have a doubt about it, whether it is genuine cheating or not.""  So you have Africans who are basically saying that age fraud in athletics is a big issue in Africa but you claim it's xenophobia when other countries question the authenticity of a player who may not be the age they are claiming to be? The only one who is misinformed is you. You haven't provided anything other than anecdotal evidence. Keep living life thinking racism, xenophobia, misogynism, and whatever other ism is the reason something is happening. I'm done responding to you."
"If that hurts the player’s relationship with the team, that’s because their feelings or ego was hurt like I said. Other guys who have been criticized in the media from their coaches, from Kobe to Tony Parker to Pascal Siakam, all took it like professional adult athletes and used it as motivation.   And the falling out with Simmons was clearly mutual. After that embarrassing showing against Atlanta Philly wanted him gone. And sure you could say docs comments hurt his value. Personally idk how much opposing GMs take stock into the words of coaches but that could be right"
"&gt;I feel like Miami is probably even better than Toronto  Guess you forgot that Pascal Siakam, Fred Vanvleet, OG Anunoby, Norman Powell, and Chris Boucher ever existed."
Not better than 27th pick Pascal Siakam lol
"I am not a draft expert. But I am an NBA fan and the draft fascinates me so I pay extra attention. I swear to god, that night when I heard the Raptors took Pascal Siakam I immediately opened r/nba and commented ""are we inventing imaginary names at this point?""  It was such a huge reach and a testament to Masai's greatness as a GM."
"Depends on what exactly you'd define as a second option. For instance, Pascal Siakam was the second scoring option for the Raps in 2019 but Kyle Lowry clearly had a bigger impact on the game than him. I think CJ can be a guy that can get the team buckets but you're going to run into issues if he's the team's second most important player."
PG: FVV  SG: Gary Trent Jr.   SF: OG Anunoby   PF: Pascal Siakam  C: Khem Birch  Bench:  Goran Dragic  Malachi Flynn  Scottie Barnes  Chris Boucher  Precious Achiuwa
How in the world has pascal siakam had a better career than Simmons?
"You might want to watch every Raptors game that season. Unless Brown was defending Siakam every game, it's really not as significant as Cs fans think lmao. Dude was having mental problems he was dealing with https://www.tsn.ca/pascal-siakam-opens-up-about-struggles-in-the-bubble-i-didn-t-recognize-myself-1.1559704."

"&gt; Ignoring the contradiction in calling the team ""talent-starved"" when they have OG, Siakam and VanVleet plus promising young players in Trent Jr., Scottie Barnes and Precious Achiuwa, if it involves trading Fred along with Boucher, Dragic and a first, then I am absolutely not in favor of it.  They are 100% high end talent starved.   OG, Trent Jr. Scottie and precious are all good role players or show promise. FVV is a really good guard but not quite all star. Siakam with no injuries is an all star except he's coming off injury.   This team replaced Lowry, Kawhi, Ibaka/Gasol with noone of similar value. We completely lack high end talent. We have no first start, we have no leader like the way Lowry was. We have no quality centers like Ibaka/Gasol. Our Center rotation right now is just good backup centers being played as starters.   Pascal is coming off injury,  his ramp up to game shape will take a while and the jury is still out if he can ever become an all star again. He willl no doubt struggle on a team without a true point guard in the starting lineup. FVV is not a point guard. He's a shooting guard in a point guards body.   I won't argue how good of a shooter FVV is. but he isn't really a leader and he isn't a playmaker. and he's streaky prone to hero ball espeacilly with even less talent around him.   I see Ben brining playmaking, defense and scoring on this team. He has shown he can do that in the regular season and is only 24.   Do i want to trade the whole kitchen sink for him? No but you would be absolutely the biggest homer ever if you don't think he could bring value to this team if we didn't give up too much for him.  He would instantly help Siakam, and FVV if we could keep him in a trade.  Salary wise? cap space means nothing in Toronto since we will never attract a big FA. We need to find our stars in trades or drafting.  I want to stress, for the right price, Ben is a great get for this team."
That Celtics Raptors series was one of the best chess match in a while. I feel like Nurse came out as winner based on how much more Stevens team struggled to figure out/ not even sure if they ever figure out the zone against Raptors this series.. and that it became abundantly clear there was a gap of talent of production between Jaylen Brown and Pascal Siakam… yet it took Celtics 7 games to beat Raptors
"Ignoring the contradiction in calling the team ""talent-starved"" when they have OG, Siakam and VanVleet plus promising young players in Trent Jr., Scottie Barnes and Precious Achiuwa, if it involves trading Fred along with Boucher, Dragic and a first, then I am absolutely not in favor of it.   Fred is our second-best shooter Pascal (arguably he's our most efficient shooter from the 3), an offensive threat and a natural leader.  With Lowry gone, that last factor is going to become more important, and I don't see Ben bringing that leadership to the Raptors, let alone being our first, second or even third option on offense unless Nick Nurse and our staff can work on his ""pass first"" apprehension to shooting.  And even then, I'm not optimistic about our chances of ""fixing"" Ben Simmons."
"1) Who cares if Dragic doesn't play? We're not over the tax, we don't need to worry about dumping an expiring contract.  2) That 1st still doesn't make up the difference between Simmons and Siakam.  3) You know Pascal as a 2nd option beat Simmons's team when he was as a 3rd option, right? If Pascal is a bad 2nd option, what does that make Simmons? Siakam was shut down by Jaylen Brown... Simmons was shut down by... Gallinari?  4) The Raptors didn't come out and say that, we just had an article last week about how Siakam does not want to be traded.  5) Simmons needs a team that has floor spacers. We are a poor shooting team, he's not a good fit. Maybe the Wolves or Warriors would be better for him."
Jaylen Brown  Julius Randle  Pascal Siakam
"Last gm drafted him and with Casey as the couch it was a poor situation; Sekou was a raw prospect but Casey doesn't want to give guys the minutes to develop. Bad team or not, Casey wants to do everything he can to win the game in front of him. Then Jerami Grant, who plays the same position, became the de facto franchise player. Saddiq Bey is older and more developed than Sekou; his skillset is what you want from a role player, so he naturally jumped in the rotation.   Sekou also dealt with random injuries like concussions that kept him out and missed valuable learning minutes because of the pandemic. Remember that between March and December of 2020, he didn't play organized basketball.   His summer league wasn't good. He had a big game but for the most part he blended into the court. You're expecting more from a 3rd year player in summer league. On the other hand, he's still only 20 years old. For comparison: Saddiq Bey (22), Jalen Smith (21),  De'Andre Hunter (23), Brandon Ingram (23), Davion Mitchell (23), Chris Duarte (24), Tey Murphy (21), Ayo Dosunmu (22), Pascal Siakam (27). I don't think it's fair to write him off yet, but if he's going to grow it wasn't going to be in Detroit."
Pascal Siakam is your teams star.
"Yes, I'm serious.  There's more to what makes NBA players valuable than their PPG stat, lol.  OG has demonstrated on multiple occasions that he can be the guy to hit game winners in clutch situations.  Siakam has missed at least four game winners in this past season alone that I can remember despite us fully trusting and playing around him as The Guy.  It's widely known that teams have finally figured out Pascal's spinning in the post and his progress has greatly suffered for it.  In a pinch, OG for what he brings for his contract is easily more valuable to us than Pascal on his max deal."
"this does not appear to be a very exclusive club. i looked through 1973-74 (the first year steals/blocks were recorded) and last season, found a bunch of names (ppg/rpg/apg/spg/bpg formatting)  Rick Barry (1973-74: 5th, 31st, 8th, 5th, 34th)   John Havlicek (1973-74: 9th, 35th, 9th, 28th, 42nd)   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1973-74: 3rd, 4th, 18th, 24th, 2nd)   Dave Cowens (1973-74: 23rd, 2nd, 22nd, 35th, 10th)   Sidney Wicks (1973-74: 10th, 21st, 23rd, 36th, 21st)   Bob Lanier (1973-74: 11th, 8th, 25th, 25th, 4th)   Sam Lacey (1973-74: 47th, 7th, 31st, 16th, 7th)   Rudy Tomjanovich (1973-74: 6th, 22nd, 48th, 47th, 22nd)     Nikola Jokic (2020-2021: 10th, 9th, 6th, 21st, t-50th)   Giannis Antetokounmpo (2020-2021: 5th, 7th, 23rd, 14th, 5th)   Bam Adebayo (2020-2021: 37th, 15th, 28th, 25th, 24th)   Pascal Siakam (2020-2021: 27th, 28th, 41st, 42nd, t-50th)    like 6 or 7 guys from last season gated by blocks alone, draymond gated by points."
"The third best players on the last three title teams are Pascal Siakam, KCP/Rondo, and Jrue Holiday. Ben is definitely better than all those guys  I know his value has fallen off but not *that* much"
"Until the playoffs most people would consider Ben Simmons better than Pascal Siakam. I would do a CJ Siakam swap in an instant, compared with CJ Simmons swap."
"&gt; consildate Collins, Reddish, and picks for a second star to go along with Trae like Pascal Siakam or Jaylen Brown  If the Celtics didn't trade Brown for Harden there no way they trading for a package that would be a downgrade."
The Raptors won 53 games after Kawhi left.  Were they stacked that year?  Pascal Siakam had better offensive stats that season in less minutes than Pippen the year after MJ retired.  Is Siakam even a top 30 player in the league right now?  What did Scottie ever do without MJ?
"For sure I def get it and you cant just let talent like that go. But like the originally post that extra star internally needs to happen fast because you have extensions hitting fast. Hunter will get a max, Huerter and Cam will get decent deals as well. I think they should consildate Collins, Reddish, and picks for a second star to go along with Trae like Pascal Siakam or Jaylen Brown"
Partially because pascal is a bit overrated defender and tobias is a bit underrated   Partially because siakam is a truly awesome offensive player who’s struggled due to a down year in shooting and being miscast as a first option. Tobi struggles when he’s the focal point of the offense. Siakam just straight up has a better scoring game imo
Who do you think is better right now? Pascal Siakam or Kevin Knox
"Its odd because other players signed to speculative high dollar contracts do get killed for whether or not they improve.  Pascal Siakam is a great example, he was signed to a max with the expectation he could grow into the role of a no. 1 and he's struggled to do so and as a result has been regularly eviscerated, even when his numbers are solid and when circumstance is impacting his effectiveness more than his skill.  Ben was asked to take a max contract in order to become an effective Robin to Joel Embiid's Batman, to be a highly effective no. 2 and he gets babied for 3 years coming off a promising but not otherworldly rookie season.  He then improves/changes/develops 0% with nearly identical statlines nothing but second round exits and Morey wants us to believe he's a superstar.  Simmons has been gifted the most undeserved rep in the league, born on 3rd base whining why people don't see him as a home run hitter."
"Raptors will centre a package around This Pascal Siakam + fillers. Scottie Barnes and OG are off limits obviously.   Philly must realize, they killed Simmons’ trade value after they threw him under the bus after the playoffs. That’s why he won’t show up to training camp. Which will only degrade value further, not to mention will create a clown show in Philly.   Pascal Siakam is the best possible return from a team that is actually looking to trade for Simmons. Plus Pascal is a Great fit next to Embiid. Better than Simmons. No you are not getting Beal or Lilliard. Be realistic at this point"
"Pascal has the same amount of choke jobs as Ben, the difference between the two is that Siakam choking had no repercussions because Kawhi was playing out of his mind."
Pascal Siakam is more skilled than Durant. Durant just shoots better. Everything else is in Siakam's favor skill-wise.
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.  (IN NO ORDER)  Lebron James  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Damian Lillard  Steph Curry  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Trae Young  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Jrue Holliday  Jamal Murray  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jimmy Butler  Zach Lavine  Luka Doncic  Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal"
"1. We played in Tampa Bay, all road games. Only team in the league not at home  2. One of the worst teams hit by covid, affected our best players and even coaching staff   3. 4th seed before being destroyed by covid and deciding to rank   4. Majority of the season was then a tank job  You are a casual. 2019/2020 Raptors had the second best record in the league, on pace for 60 wins, and that was with Siakam as our #1 option.   Pascal is in a completely different category of player in comparison to Wiggins. You should head over to the Warriors subreddit if you wanna spew casual takes about him being as good as Pascal, they’ll entertain and agree with you."
Thats just a list of players he better then and are still considered a steal for their talent. Wiggins is essentially Pascal Siakam without a ring.
Pascal Siakam and Jakob Poeltl
Pascal Siakam is an average starter.  Fred VanVleet is an all-star.
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
"Makes sense for the Sixers. Siakam didn't have a good shooting season last year, but he was at the 36-37% mark in each of the two seasons prior to that so it's not like he can't shoot. Pascal with a 3 point shot is a legitimate all NBA player, his all around game both offensively and defensively will fit like a glove with Embiid.  Simmons makes sense for the Raptors in theory, he's younger and technically has a higher ceiling on a team that's looking to rebuild. However, his attitude is a huge red flag and he has openly stated that he doesn't want to be in Toronto so that trade no longer makes sense for the Raptors. If this trade was to happen, the Sixers would have to add more assets which they obviously don't want to do. If I were the Sixers, I'd rather gamble for Lillard/Beal becoming available.   From Toronto's side, there's no reason for them to trade a fan favorite (he's loved in Toronto despite getting shit on) who actually wants to be here for a dude that hasn't improved in 4 years and doesn't want to be here unless there are other assets enticing enough attached to the trade."
"Honestly our full squad is nothing but sick names. Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Pascal Siakam, Freddy Vanvleet, OG Anuonoby, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Nick Nurse, Yuta Watanabe, Delano Blanton, Goran Dragic. even Scottie Barnes is kinda cool  Definitely top 5 team based purely on cool/unique names"
No love for the human beyblade himself pascal siakam? That’s tuff
"I do wonder if our definition of what's neutral or good is different. To be clear I'm talking about his impact and fact he is a center generally helps that.  I can see your point as well though. While Jokic grades as slight positive on most defensive impact metrics LA-DRAPM does have him as slight negative.  In any case overall I guess it comes down to what you consider neutral defense for example. If you compare him to other anchor big's you could say he's below average, however most anchor big's tend to be above average.  On D-LEBRON his last season (0.61) grades him as around top 75 defender out of 247 players that played over 1000mins that season. This would put him among players like KAT, Jayson Tatum, Maxi Kleber, Montrezl Harrell and Pascal Siakam.   For me I would consider most guys in this 0.3 - 1.0 range to be slight positives on defense. Usually these are players that have at least few notable issues or limitations that stop them from being clear positive, but who also have some strong points and do enough to where you can be fairly certain that at least they aren't hurting their teams on that end. I think alongside of Jokic KAT and Josh Jackson are really good examples of this."
"Pascal Siakam, the spinning gorilla one for obvious reasons"
When Pascal Siakam was good it was because he was also a threat from three.
"Jaylen is coming off of surgery so he might have a cold start to the season as he gets adjusted. For better or for worse (and it’s for worse imo), fans and media don’t seem to be able to shed early season impressions (see: Pascal Siakam making All-NBA second team because he had a hot month to start the season). I could see something like that happening for Jaylen, unfortunately, where he’s cold to start the year and that reputation sticks with him for the whole season."
Aaron Gordon   Pascal Siakam  Giannis   All around 2 way PF with a spotty jumper
"&gt; your backcourt is going to be a problem like C was last year  Honestly I feel a backcourt of FVV/dragic/Trent Jr/Flynn is at worst an average backcourt and far from the shit show of Boucher/no one else we had at C last year.   &gt; Pascal and Barnes have a lot of overlap  I mean Barnes isn't a starter anyway, but I also don't see the overlap considering Barnes is expected to be a project who can't score and Pascal is our first option.   &gt; I think it’s pretty clear your franchise is beginning a rebuild  I was super pro-tank last year, but if we were really starting a true rebuild we would have traded Siakam and probably FVV away already. It's more of a retooling to get younger pieces while still trying to make the playoffs."
"Toronto is in a transitionary period, but the question is whether they got more worse than the Hornets got better?  The Raptors guard rotation is weaker than the Hornets', though I think you are overestimating Ball slightly and underestimating VanVleet slightly.  I think its hard to argue that the Hornets frontcourt is better, Siakam and OG are more versatile options than Washington/Hayward; and I have no confidence that Hayward will stay healthy long enough to revert back to old Hayward and make it a contest between him and Pascal.  Centre is basically a wash between each team.  Last year the Hornets won 6 more games than the Raptors.   The respective factors in their issues were Lamelo's Injury and Hayward's for the Hornets.  COVID absences, Pascal/Kyle injuries and playing ~70 away games for the Raptors.  We lose Kyle over the offseason, gain Scottie Barnes, Dragic and Precious Achiuwa, likely a net negative in win shares.  Hornets get Oubre, Plumlee, Bouknight and Kai Jones, I would score that as neutral, maybe +2 win shares.  My confidence comes from believing that a healthy Raptors team that gets to play out of Toronto increases wins by 8-10. Whether that is enough remains to be seen, any gap in projected wins is made up by homerism.  My greater point is that you refer to teams getting significantly better in the last 2 years, for the Hornets their improvement is Lamelo Ball, Hayward and improvement from Rozier. In the last 4 years they finish 10th, 9th, 10th and 10th in the East. Their success this year depends on Lamelo growth, Rozier maintenance/growth and Hayward health, none of their acquisitions are big needle movers.  I don't think they belong in the conversation about why the Raptors no longer figure into the Playoff picture. And as for the Raptors not being contenders, that's pretty clear, but not because the Hornets are a juggernaut.  My confidence in 100 out of 100 matchups is just me saying if I was putting money on the head to head matchup, I'm taking the Raps."
"I really doubt you watch more Nuggets game than I had the past 4 years, you’re just behind multiple burners taking on different team flairs dude, stats are cute but you would know better if you actually watch games, or unless you just a huge homer that you can’t just deal with it.  Murray playmaking is average at best, he’s not that PnR savant, not ideal to be a primarily lead guard in an offensive engine if he was to be put as a number 1 guy.. hence like I said he’s a combo guard. Murray works best with Jokic in PnR and their 2 men game and chemistry are what drive Murray play making much better..  For me Murray is like on the same playmaking tier as Jrue Holiday or Kemba Walker. His passing out of PnR into cross court corner 3 are not even as accurate as say someone like Dame or Conley.. and he’s of course way behind than the likes of Brogdon or Fox when it comes to playmaking.  Also you’re already flat out wrong about Murray and Brown defense being a tie. Take the L boi. Murray for the most part have been below average on that end, on ball and off ball were bad, got better off ball first, then recently got better on ball but by no means it’s a toss up when it comes to comparing him to Jaylen Brown. Brown is a multi positional defender able to check 2-4, He clamped Pascal Siakam in the Playoffs all by himself for example. He can legit provide lock down defense where as Murray has been more a liability on that end more often than not."
"&gt; OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher and Yuta Watanabe  That’s not really a logjam. For one, Yuta and OG could play the 2 and have at times last season. Another thing to mention is that the front court has 3 slots while the backcourt has 2. Starting OG/Siakam/Birch then having Barnes/Boucher/Achiuwa off the bench is perfectly fine. I could see Nurse cycling in Yuta to be a positional filler in case someone goes down."
"Well I said that because no one wants Pascal as their first option, but if we are talking guys to put next to other stars, I'm saying Wiggins fits with most players easily while Siakam you would need to think through fit first, its not a given he would fit with all teams.  He is better though, I'm not denying that"
"Pascal Siakam, give em to me."
"Raptors GM Bobby Webster had a press conference yesterday to clarify that ""the goal isn't to tear it down to the studs and 'trust the process,' rather Toronto wants to build around its core of Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, and Pascal Siakam""  I'm sure they will listen to the Kings but they are not looking to rebuild and will not trade Siakam at a discount.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/raptors/.amp/news/toronto-raptors-bobby-webster-build-around-young-core"
"Siakam is a stud if he's your second (ideally third guy imo) on a playoff team. But his contract and age aren't ideal for the Raptors if they are trying to get younger imo. His best years will probably be in the next handful of years and the Raptors are going to be fighting tooth and nail for a play in spot of that's what they're going for.   Tyrese just makes more sense from my POV if I was looking to pivot into a young core, but some people see it differently. It's a tough situation for Masai honestly, FVV and Pascal have atleast earned the right to be ""the guys"" after how hard they've worked, but their ceiling just isn't that high with just those two alone as your core...."
"Haliburton is good but I don't think him + picks is worth Siakam, has to be higher potential youngster(s) as a centerpiece for Siakam. They'll need to attach salary with Haliburton too.  Wiggins, 2 of Wiseman/Kuminga/Moody for Pascal and something is the kind of ballpark his value should be."
There's talk because lots of teams need a dude like Siakam. And the Raptors FO probably were receptive to offers and called around to gauge his value.  But it's not like Bobby or Pascal are actively trying to force a trade.
"Raptors are not trading Siakam. At least not this season anyway.  They are building around Pascal, OG, and Fred."
1. Ingram 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Jamal Murray 4. Ben Simmons 5. Pascal Siakam 6. Dejounte Murray 7. Sabonis 8. Caris Levert 9. Buddy Hield
"We have drafted extremely well. A lot of our picks haven’t been lottery picks, but those that were we have hit on a lot of the time. We’ve drafted Chris Bosh, Vince Carter (sorta), Tracy McGrady, Damon Stoudamire, DeMar DeRozan, and with picks in the late 20’s have drafted OG Anunoby, and Pascal Siakam. Not to mentioned we signed FVV as an UDFA. From 1995-2019, we have made 8 very, very good selections through the draft. That’s one every three years.  We’ve literally been a playoff team for the past 8ish years. That’s a third of this team’s existence. I don’t call that underperforming."
Josh Giddey will be a bust  Pascal Siakam has an overall regression in productivity  Jazz make the playoffs but are a lower half seed 5-8
"Its definitely optimistic to call that his established floor rather than his hard ceiling.  He's had 4 summers to work on his game and he chose to hang out with his brother and fuck models. Nothing wrong with that life, but you better be comfy with him not touching a basketball like Pascal Siakam in Quarantine."
"[Jalen Suggs](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-jalen-suggs-nba-draft-preview) ""Toronto, as Suggs acknowledged, has one of the NBA's best developmental programs.

Yall aint winning anything with pascal siakam/ fred/ barnes/ og / trent. You have to be delusional if you think that's a championship contender if they all ever reach their primes lol   bunch of scrubs being overhyped
Same with Pascal Siakam.
Pascal Siakam has been traded to the Kings for a deal centered around Marvin Bagley and Davion Mitchell.
"Jalen Harris became the 10th different player on the Raptors to score 30 points in a game last season. He joined: Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Kyle Lowry, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson.  5 of those names are likely not returning so we have 5 now."
"The last time Siakam played playoff ball in front of a home crowd he was doing shit like [this](https://youtu.be/3ugrYiEl9gg). Pascal is still a better player than Randle, but if Randle continues his development from last season (/proves it wasn’t an anomaly) he could pass him."
heard pascal siakam and brandon ingram are clearly better than randle. id like to see either of them elevate a team on their own the way randle did. they could be better but give me a break that it’s a clearly obvious take
Don't talk to me about overpay when your team is employing Pascal Siakam
"I'd trade them all for an Anthony Davis level player a la LeGM, but not for a Pascal Siakam type."
"He'll never be better than the real Pascal, Siakam."
I don’t think Klay or Siakam gets in. Don’t even think Pascal will play enough by then and will Klay start the season? Think Middelton gets that last east spot. Warriors may not even be a high enough seed to get 2 selections.
what do you mean weird obsession. i don't want pascal siakam on the warriors he doesn't fit period. wiggins is a plus on our just because you didn't watch us this year doesn't mean we should trade our players away for pennies.
"As a Warriors fans who likes Nick Nurse and watches some of their games, I see no way Pascal Siakam trade helps the Warriors given the assets given up in trade iterations I've read/heard about. Not sure about Beal either, tbh. I'm a fan of balanced teams, if a team has lop-sided roster construction it should be because it's an unassailable combination like the Nets 3."
"Scottie Barnes looks terrible(although this should be expected he’s a project), Pascal Siakam does not return to form, Birch goes down with an injury and we’re left without a center again"
"This sub underrates Pascal Siakam so much, it's actually gross. In this trade, the Raptors get two late future FRPs and salary filler for their best player. OK."
"Thoughts on this three team trade I thought of this morning  Bulls Receive: Robert Covington  Trailblazers Receive: Pascal Siakam  Raptors Receive: Lauri Markkenen, Coby White, Anfernee Simmons, 2022 Trailblazers FRP, 2024 Trailblazers FRP"
It makes 0 sense for Kings to swap Fox for Siakam. what they gon’ do? Throw away their star and franchise player of the past 5 seasons to build around fkin’ Pascal Siakam?  Only reason why they want Siakam is to form the Fox-Siakam pick and pop.
Eh Siakam does fine with another paint presence as long as they know where to position themselves. The worst combo for Pascal was when he was in there with Baynes. He actually did better with Birch because they had better rapport. Pascal absolutely has a minor floor spacing effect. He draws doubles quite often even if he can't finish over them the way a better forward would. Plus I don't see Barnes and Siakam playing together that much  in the first year but who knows what Nurse does.
"The problem is the Kings aren't getting Siakam without including either Hali or Davion. The Raptors are not trading Pascal for Buddy, Bagley, and picks. That's an absolutely insulting package."
"I see a lot of portland fans suggesting Siakam or Simmons for CJ. Frankly, I doubt Morey would trade Simmons if the only offer is cj + picks. And I really don't see a path to get Pascal given that the Kings have interest, a better offer for the raptors, and cap space. The raptors have no interest in CJ, and I can't think of a team with cap space who wants the near 30 year old guard.  Tobias Harris for CJ is too reasonable of an offer for this to actually happen. It would make both teams significantly better though, imo."
Pascal Siakam improved in practically every stat last season. His 3p% dipped but also he played they entire season on the road and suffered through his teams major covid outbreak sooooo
"Here's my take.   1. Portland should be in the Ben Simmons sweepstakes. 2. Portland should be in the Pascal Siakam sweepstakes.  3. Would Detroit trade Jerami Grant for Nurkic? He doesn't fit Cade's timeline so is he going to be on the team when it's time for Detroit to win?  Portland's issue is defense, they never have enough of it and offense, they get so little of it from their wings and bigs. All three of these guys theoretically would help."
who is talking about Ben like that? he constantly gets hated on lmao. talk about playing the victim lol  and if you really think about it why would Siakam fit a team trading a star player like Dame? that team is more than likely rebuilding anyway and Pascal wouldn't fit
"Another player 24/4/4 on 50/38/80 at 22. And that player is Collin sexton. Both are in losing situations.   Stats don't always tell the story. I'm just saying the narrative on a player changes drastically once they get paid.   Look at DeAngelo Russell, De'aron Fox, pascal siakam, kemba walker. All these players were considered no-brainers for a max and now they get shit on because they aren't carrying teams.  Just saying look for the narrative to change if the team keeps losing."
famously immobile pascal siakam
We can trade Pascal Siakam for a Big Man
Many are mentioning picking up someone with a MLE (name that keeps coming up is Otto Porter Jr) and leveraging that into a 3-way trade where we give up CJ and land Pascal Siakam. I don't know the specifics lol so hopefully someone can elaborate more. But hopefully we figure out a way to make it work in a way where no team gets screwed.
"That team was so stacked now that I think about it..  Kyle Lowry  Danny Green  Kawhi Leonard  Pascal Siakam  Marc Gasol  Fred VanVleet  Norman Powell  OG Anunoby   Serge Ibaka  A solid 9 man rotation with a perfect blend of offense and defense.. and that’s not including guys like Chris Boucher, Patrick McCaw or Jeremy Lin"
Pascal is out for a while. So is Siakam.
Ben Simmons and pascal siakam will contribute to winning more over the next two seasons that any rookie we got plus wiseman
I can’t wait until they trade him and 8 future 1st rounders in 3 years to clear cap space to make a run at Pascal Siakam in their bid to create a new super team
"Masai just on the Raptors  (discounting the Melo trade in Denver that was amazing and the Kawhi trade because we all know):  - Traded Bargnani's awful contract for a lottery pick    used to select Jakob Poeltl.   - Traded Greivis Vasquez to the Bucks for 2 picks that turned into OG Anunoby and Norman Powell.   - Signed Fred VanVleet to an undrafted deal.   - Traded Valanciunas, Wright and picks for an old Marc Gasol so we could win. Morey refused to do this for Lowry and that's why Sixers couldn't go further.    - Traded Terrence Ross and a second for Serge Ibaka.     - Drafted Pascal Siakam #27 when few had heard of him.    - Fired Casey and hired a largely unknown Nick Nurse.     Masai is a tier above Morey. He has had elite moves i  trades, drafts and coaching hires. They shouldn't be discussed in the same breath."
Miami should now trade butler for Pascal Siakam and OG
"So you agree Siakam was the second option then?  Siakam is a better offensive player all around. His playmaking is improving, so even tho Ben is still better at that, the gap is shrinking.  The gap in their defence isn’t that large either. But the gap in their offence is gigantic. Pascal is a better player than Ben and should have more value than him. The only reason he doesn’t is age and people still think Ben will get it together for some reason"
"Seriously tho, yes I agree, perhaps trash is a strong word.. but the point remains: Pascal Siakam is not an elite scorer as your fellow Raptors fan guy claimed, that was the initial argument, don’t chime in like a nephew next time"
Pascal siakam will be screaming on every drive
"Raptors fans gaslighting us about Wiggins Wiseman 7/14 not being enough, enjoy this return for God’s Gift to the sport, Pascal Siakam."
They'd fit real well with Pascal and Siakam
"&gt;The Blazers and Raptors have had early discussions about a trade involving CJ McCollum and Pascal Siakam, per Jake Fisher of Bleacher Report.  This is a report on his report.  Not validation of it."
"Terrible take.  The two teams are different based of roster construction, fit, quality players on either team and the level of desperation.. Blazers are much more desperate, with lower quality ceiling even as of right now based on current roster between the two teams.  There are also no available trade to make and contracts to make sense for the Warriors fit.. Warriors not gonna ship Wiggins and all their assets for a guy like Ben Simmons and Pascal Siakam..   Meanwhile Portland has CJ McCollum to swing for a Siakam or Ben Simmons that prob yield better fit and make sense for both teams in trade."
"The fit isn't good anymore, but I really do think we'd happily do Simmons for Lowry and Boucher. He's 24, we love his type of player and are apparently quite open to trading Siakam, so maybe we'd look to trade Pascal for a shooter."
"That's the thing though: they don't want a star who doesn't move the needle (by taking a likely first-round exit team to a second-round exit team, a second-round exit team to a conference finals team, etc). So while like Pascal Siakam is better than Wiggins, the upgrade doesn't really move that needle all that much."
uhh yeah? Pascal showed up in the Finals for sure but was garbage against Philly and Milwaukee bailed out by Kawhi's heroics   tf? i'm not even a warriors fan. you Raptors fans need to take off the homer goggles. Siakam trade value isn't that high
"Pascal Siakam is a proven top 3 player on a championship team and someone that led the 2019-2020 Raptors to a top 3 record in the entire league, while making it to the allstar team and allnba. What the hell has Wiggins done? And I say that as someone who has always rooted for Andrew.            They are different levels of players. If Pascal was playing next to Steph and Dray, there is no way they wouldn’t have made the playoffs. I’m sure Pascal would have benefited a lot from having Curry take off the offensive pressure (so he doesn’t have to be the \#1 option) and play with Draymond instead of Aaron fucking Baynes.            The fit with Pascal is incredible. He puts a lot of pressure on the rim so teams can’t go small against Warriors. He is a great passer that helps their motion offense. He is a great defender with size."
The Raptors would rather have Siakam than Simmons.  Who would you rather have in a playoff series? Pascal is just straight up a better player.
"&gt;	he’s better than Siakam as a fit on the Warriors   Can someone explain to me how this is even remotely true?              Like I get not wanting to trade for Pascal, but they are not even comparable players."
"I didn’t mean the year after Kawhi left, I meant this year. Pascal couldn’t lead his team even close to the playoffs, while Westbrook helped bring his team to the 8 seed with a much worse roster than the Raptors. He also led a much, much worse team to the playoffs with the 2017 Thunder. They were a bum squad compared to Toronto.  You clearly are the one who has zero idea what they are talking about. Siakam is not better than Russell, you are delusional for thinking otherwise.  “Overrated playmaker” fucking insane. Put Siakam on the Wizards this year and they don’t sniff the playoffs.  Edit: and FYI, Westbrook getting rebounds and starting the break IS a scheme. You clearly don’t watch games."
"&gt; No one has said this. Raps aren't calling people.  Jake fischer did. The guy who also called the raps picking barnes.  &gt; Raps turned down Wiseman, Wiggins, and 2 FR picks. Seems you do need to offer a lot.  Was this ever confirmed? As far as I know this literally originated as a random idea from a podcaster. Even if this was legit, maybe masai just hates wiseman. Or maybe he’s looking for win-now pieces.  Or maybe it just wasn’t a good enough offer. The only thing I was arguing against is that the raptors would only trade pascal for a crazy return package, as some raptors fans argued. Think about it, if the raptors weren’t looking to trade siakam, they would probably only accept a big overpay for their star. If they are trading him I’m sure they’re still looking for something quite good, and I wouldn’t be shocked if the warriors package (that we don’t know if it was a real offer btw) wasn’t quite enough."
"Siakam is in a different league when it comes to defense, like maybe even in a different universe. Defensive votes don’t mean shit, voters are terrible.  You’re tripping. He’s an overrated playmaker and doesn’t create good looks for his teammates, he forces bad shots by forcing a pass like what Rondo does sometimes.   Westbrook hasn’t lead a team anywhere other than first round exist.  We lost Kawhi and had the second best record in the league actually, you don’t even know what you’re talking about. Pascal was probably our best player that year on a team that basically won 60 games. Has Westbrook ever done that? No.   Westbrook can’t play defense, ruins schemes by hunting rebounds and forcing passes. There’s a reason his teams have never gone anywhere. While Siakam is a two way player who has shown up during the brightest stages while Westbrook routinely shot his teams out of the game in the playoffs.  You have no idea what you’re talking about as evidenced by you think our team dropped off once Kawhi left even though we actually had a better record the year after."
We need role players. Pascal Siakam would be a solid backup to Rui
"the heat are interested in every free agent  i dont know how they will pay bam, jimmy b, herro, duncan, kyle lowry, spencer dinwiddie, bradley beal, pascal siakam, and kawhi leonard but ive been wrong before"
"And what points do you have exactly? You brought up defense like Siakam is some stellar defender. He didn’t get a single all-defensive team vote this year.  Westbrook affects the game in more ways than Siakam. He’s a better facilitator, rebounder, and team leader. I sure as hell would hope a power forward would shoot more efficiently than a point guard who has to largely create most of his shots on his own. Pascal was also the guy on his team, while Westbrook was the clear number 2 option and still averaged more points.  Westbrook’s leadership has been well documented by practically everyone he has played with. Whatever team he goes to, he changes their culture for the better. Never takes a night off. There were numerous times throughout the year that Siakam was just a complete no show for the Raptors. At least when Westbrook is shooting poorly, he can still have a positive impact on the game with his playmaking and energy.  Westbrook joined the Wizards and helped them to an 8 seed. Kawhi left y’all and you became bottom feeders, with a better team than the Wizards if I may add. Siakam is not a leader, nor is he close to being better than Westbrook.  Stop this nonsense slander."
"I mean that’s just a flat out lie statistically lol. He had the 2nd highest usage rate and was the 2nd highest scorer.   And if you want to go the 2nd/3rd most valuable route, Siakam was his team’s Deandre Ayton in this whole player comparison.   Mikal is a 4th option 3&amp;D guy. Pascal is a legitimate number 2 scoring option on a contender."
imagine thinking that Pascal Siakam is worth a young player with all star potential. Siakam last season was a poor mans Jerami Grant. Worse on both the offensive and defensive ends of the floor.
"Let’s see the Raptors are not tanking and Pascal is not demanding a trade. Siakam proved to be a potential number 2 on a contender a couple years ago. Adding all that up the Raptors are likely asking for a similar deal to what the Sixers are asking for Simmons, so a young player that has star potential/ borderline all star along with something along the lines of 2-3 unprotected to lightly protected picks depending on the quality of the player being sent to the Raptors."
"The Raptors don't have an incentive to trade Siakam. His value is lower after the Tampa year. Now playing in a better situation, Toronto can just wait out a year and increase his trade stock (or keep him). Also drafting Barnes doesn't automatically mean Pascal is out. Barnes is versatile and is still a developmental rookie that can come off the bench.    Teams like Golden State, Portland, and Washington are the ones with incentive. Golden State wants to capitalize on Curry/Klay. Washington and Portland want to surround their stars with talent. Pascal is a great fit playing with scoring guards. PLUS there aren't many All Stars on the market right now.     I don't see any reason Toronto should accept a low ball offer. That's not to say I expect a huge haul, but teams like the Warriors have more incentive to get a deal done than Toronto does. If teams strikeout in free agency and there are multiple bidders, the value rises. Wiggins + Moody isn't a compelling offer and Toronto would rather just keep Pascal at that point."
"Siakam is younger and on a long contract. Jrue was expiring.  As for which of them is better, I'd say they're probably about the same with the slight edge for Pascal."
"And if CP3 re-signs it's going to be for 3 years, Book and Ayton would line up with that timeline.. it'd be an indication that they're all-in on winning now with CP.   Speaking of which I'd subscribe to 2-time NBA champion Pascal 'Spicy P' Siakam. Him as a tertiary scorer and 3rd ball handler outside of the guard position would be huge for their offense."
"&gt; They are, there's long been trade rumours for every star in the league.  There are trade rumors for guys like beal because it seemed possible that he would request a trade. You don’t hear rumors about guys like bam and randle (similar tier players to pascal) because it’s assumed they’re gonna be too expensive. Really, how many names are you seeing being mentioned as available as frequently as pascal?  &gt; Which is why the Raps likely won't move Siakam this year, he's at a low point coming back form injury and covid, better to get him a solid season and then decide where to go with him.  I don’t think this is as impactful as you think. Honestly the injury is a bit more worrying.  &gt; They're likely coming from other teams, like all the Giannis rumours last year when he was up for his extension.  After giannis signed his extension, it was reported that he had considered the trailblazers as a destination. Even though giannis ended up resigning doesn’t mean the reports weren’t legit, he definitely was considering leaving."
"Of course you can have James Siakam, older brother of Pascal."
"I think the trouble would be what you ask Siakam vs. Bridges to do defensively. Mikal guards the other team's best guard which is not something I think Pascal can do consistently. But, Pascal is a better wing defender than Mikal is because he has more physicality and is just stronger, which is ideally why you wouldn't want to give up Mikal for Pascal, because they'd be such a great defensive tandem. But if you're not giving up Bridges, you're giving up Ayton, which again, hurts the defense."
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler… are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
[Pascal Siakam Stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/siakapa01.html)  [Rui Hachimura Stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hachiru01.html)  Take the homer glasses off and tell me which one is better last year. Rui’s stats are basically the same from his rookie year.
is pascal that much better than bridges on the suns? in a vacuum I agree siakam is a better first or second option.   Bridges is a better defender and a better floor spacer.  suns already have two creators in paul and booker and a better rim runner in ayton.  siakam has been is a inefficient scorer these past 2 seasons since his role increased and needs the ball in his hands  I don't think he fits the suns as well as bridges.
"Siakam averaging 21ppg offenseless? FVV 19.6ppg. We lost Norm but GTJ will take up his minutes and his production will improve from 16.2ppg. OG's 15.9ppg but that's because he didn't get that many touches due to feeding Lowry FVV Norm (19.6ppg) and Pascal. You see where our points are now? That's about 80ppg from 4 remaining starters. Add in whoever the center is, and the bench, we're more than fine."
"Yup, I'm sure Siakam was terrible all season, and never picked up his play during the 2nd half of the season. I'm sure playing 0 home games didn't have an effect either.  The difference is that the Warriors are trying to win now, we're in no hurry to trade Pascal. Heck, our GM have already said that the goal is to play all 3 of OG, Pascal and Barnes."
"Literally every player in the league gets burned off the dribble. It’s about the player who limit that and all 3 of those guys can. Pascal and OG have already played and had success at the 5. Barnes clearly has the physicality to do as well. Barnes also guarded opposing guards in college, I’m not worried about him.   There’s also only a few big centres in the league, you can get away with small ball a lot more now than you ever could. That being said we obviously need a starting caliber 5.   OG and Siakam have already shown it, Barnes obviously will too."
"We can't trade Nurk, Pascal isn't good as a 5. If Raptors were interested in CJ that would be great, but I don't think they would be. Maybe a 3 team deal with the Sixers and Tobias (I'd be fine with either one of Siakam or Tobias, obviously Siakam would cost a lot more though)"
"Fam u just offered Buddy, Davion Mitchell and a 1RP for Pascal Siakam and tried to justify it. End of story."
"Bobby yesterday said wanted a guy like OG/Barnes/Siakam at every position. Would make more sense that we want to keep Pascal, unless there was some amazing offer."
"Peak Linsanity led to an inevitable drop back to his average,  the drop was more a product of the meteoric rise.    Andrew Bynum, and all the top draft busts over the years had rapid decrease in effectiveness and are now basically trivia questions but that’s sort of a different topic.   Joakim Noah fell pretty hard as his value as a rim running big man with some handles and passing were replaced with nearly the same skill sets but required shooting which he didn’t not have.   Kenneth Faried dominated an all star game then found himself without the shooting skills to stay on a roster.  carmelo declined so rapidly he couldn’t even make a team for a while until retooling his game to be a role player. he’s a top 5 scorer all time,  and almost went full Iverson at the end.  Demarcus Cousins had some good seasons before iniuries that undercut his prime   I don’t know what happened to Jabarri Parker   Pascal Siakam has been a let down since winning most improved and a championship.  And never forget Luol Deng who is still being paid by the Los Angeles Lakers lmao."
"Pascal Siakam texted Masai Ujiri after the third pick with, “Suggs.” Then, after the fourth pick, Siakam texted Ujiri: “???.” After the Raptors made that pick, Siakam texted a thumbs-down emoji."
I don't see Siakam leaving anytime soon. Plus people see his value as lower than it could be as well. Why can't we play all 3 anyway? Barnes would likely have been their backup if Pascal was healthy.
"&gt; His impact in his role is too small, even if he’s real efficient at it.  25ppg scorer and elite POA defender.  He'd be one of the highest-scoring #2s in NBA history.  &gt;He could keep getting even better, but it’s unlikely he’ll get to that point. The #2 on the top tier contenders are the likes of AD, Harden.   Lol.  Here are some other #2s over the past decade:  * Kris Middleton * Pascal Siakam * Kyrie Irving * Klay Thompson * Tony Parker * Jason Terry"
Member when everybody was PISSED we used a 27th pick on Pascal Siakam (WHO?) instead of Skal Labissière (ABSOLUTE STEAL)?   I member.
Thank you. Dumbass literally asking what's different between Fred Van Vleet and Pascal Siakam
i remember his face when we picked pascal siakam and we were mock drafted heavily to select him.  he just like who the fuck is this guy from....new mexico state?
Also I feel like Siakam is on the move with this trade (if they can get Ball)    No need to spend your #4 pick on a defensive minded wing when you have Siakam and OG no? Only way this works with OG Pascal and Barnes is Siakam plays a lot at the 5 but I don’t see why Raps would Plan like that
Pascal Siakam
"Not uncommon to draft a decent role player or even an all-star at late 1st to early 2nd round (Jimmy Butler 30th, Draymond Green 35th, Joe Harris 33rd, Malcolm Brogdon 36th, Pascal Siakam 27th ...) Chances are really bad by late 2nd round"
"I LOVE Pascal, but you win if he is your second or third best player (see 2019), not the number one guy. He's just our latest version of DeMar.  That said, there's no reason Barnes can't just have bench minutes in relief of OG and/or Siakam at least for this season. We should at least see him play at one minute."
"i'm low-key embarassed for my fanbase.  as if masai and bobby didnt find randoms like pascal siakam and fred van vleet and now they're legit ballers.  if they think barnes has got it, aite."
https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/raptors-fine-pascal-siakam-50k-for-spat-with-nick-nurse/ar-BB1eT5QD
Definitely overlap between OG/Pascal/Barnes  Who knows? I guess this might mean Siakam could be traded now but we'll see
Kendrick Perkins pronouncing Pascal Siakam was an adventure.
Pascal Siakam and a first
Why not just for Raptors starting five and include pascal siakam.  Morey doesnt seem like he wants to trade away Simmons. Also keep Simmons away from Toronto
"Having an entire team of clones puts you at a severe disadvantage, because you don't have any specialization. There's a reason NBA teams aren't actually made up entirely of 6'8 wings. Once you get past the superstars you listed, I don't actually think most of these teams would be competing for a title at all. The top answer I've seen so far is Pascal Siakam, but honestly I think that team would struggle to make it out of the first round."
Pascal Siakam
"Pascal Siakam is an NBA champion, All NBA Second Team, Most Improved Player and the best player on our roster. We’re not fucking trading that for a reclamation project that hasn’t shown a willingness to put in the effort to fix the broken aspects of his game. Siakam is a better player than Ben, he’s an elite defender in his own right so where Simmons has the edge on Siakam in defence the difference isn’t anywhere near as pronounced as the difference between Siakam and Ben on offense."
"Wiseman is not gonna give a better chance of winning, he was fucking terrible and it’s completely up in the air whether he ends up actually being good or not. Wiggins is not helping us either. Which leaves #7 which I highly doubt will end up being better than Pascal.   I would much rather see how our #4 plays within our team next year before I make any decisions on Siakam. He’ll have 2 years remaining next offseason, there is plenty of time in the future to make a judgement call on trading him."
"&gt; Some other thoughts and chatter:  &gt; Golden State assured itself of an additional first-round pick when Minnesota failed to land in the top 3 on lottery night. The Warriors now have the seventh and 14th picks plus last year’s second overall pick, James Wiseman, and there is a widespread expectation that the Warriors will use No. 7 and Wiseman, in particular, to seek more immediate upgrades to the roster. One name to watch: Pascal Siakam.   Siakam trade doesn’t make sense from salary matching. Warriors would have to ship out Wiggins too.    This is just Hollinger opining on what Warriors “should do” instead of actual news."
"Pascal for Wiggins (negative asset), Wiseman (complete gamble, came off one of the worst rookie campaigns of all time), and #7 is a fucking awful return for Siakam, who still has 3 years on deal."
"People get locked up sometimes. For example, the Toronto raptors future got locked up by maxing Pascal Siakam"
"Kyle Lowry, #4 pick, and Pascal siakam for Lillard and Norm"
"Seth curry, pascal siakam, josh childress, darth vader,  simone biles"
"1 wiseman was a rookie last year who played 3 games as a freshman in Memphis before his season ended.  2 IMO, Bigs like wiseman don’t fit well in what GS likes to do offensively. So judging him off of those factors are premature to say he’s not going to end up as a good NBA player  3 What do Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Giannis, Julius Randle, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Damontas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Donovan Mitchell, Collin Sexton and MPJ all have in common?  Don’t act like later round lottery draft picks don’t turn into all-star caliber, even MVP caliber nba players"
Good read on his improvements here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/raptors/.amp/news/toronto-raptors-get-imporved-playmaking-from-pascal-siakam
Pascal Siakam
"Pascal Siakam is a good fit, if Toronto is willing to move him. Definitely not for CJ, but a 3 team trade could work."
"Move over Pascal Siakam, Giannis is the new beyblade"
Short Pascal Siakam with better handles.
&gt; And five more: Bam Adebayo (No. 14 in 2017); Domantas Sabonis (No. 11 in 2016); Pascal Siakam (No. 27 in 2016); Nikola Vucevic (No. 16 in 2011); Zach LaVine (No. 13 in 2014).  I feel like Brogdon was a bigger steal than Sabonis.
I honestly don’t think Simmons does anything for us. We’re not running him as point guard because that’s idiotic so he’s competing with Pascal for the PF position and I’d 100 percent rather have Siakam and give up a little bit on defence (and Siakam is excellent on defence so I don’t think you’re giving up that much) while having a player who is better in every respect on the offensive end. Simmons literally does not improve the team
Stars are players  who can put up big numbers for you every once and a while. For example Pascal Siakam is a star. Super stars do this every single night and are more consistent stars. For example Curry is a super star.
siakam was good but i wanted to hear about pascal
&gt; Siakam was averaging 20/7/3 with great defense and it's like he didn't exist.  They were too busy focusing on what Pascal was doing to be bothered looking at Siakam.
"Sacramento has had 9 top-8 picks in the last 10 years. At some point it’s not the league’s fault, but the teams poor scouting and drafting.   Here’s a list of players the Kings missed drafting in the last 10 years:  2018:  Selected Marvin Bagley.  Missed: Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgeous Alexander  2016:  Selected Marquese Chriss.  Missed: Damontas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Dejounte Murray  2015:  Selected Willie Cauley-Stein.  Missed: Devon Booker, Myles Turner, Terry Rozier,  2014:  Selected Nick Stauskas  Missed: Elfrid Payton, TJ Warren, Clint Capella, Bogdon Bogdonovic, Joe Harris, Nikola Jokic  At some point, there’s a reason why the teams have sucked for 20 years. The Kings have had 15 years worth of lottery picks, with only one or two nice pieces to show for it"
They're gonna move down and draft someone who Casey will have an easier time comparing to Pascal Siakam.
"Seems a little odd to exclude the best players on each team (i.e. Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Pascal Siakam) if you're asking to rank the teams"
"So when given the choice between looking at playoff stats and reg season stats, why pick the reg season? Are you implying Pascal Siakam is more of a regular season player? That, I can agree with.  That year, Simmons had a higher offensive rating, defensive rating, 64 vs 54 % TS(!), higher PER. This is not even a competition. There is no evidence Ben attacking the rim was in any way detrimental enough to their offense to offset the difference between horrible efficiency and elite efficiency. Add to this his great passing, which generates better looks for teammates.  I understand you realize you’ve gone too deep to back down, but come on.  Acting like elite one-on-one defensive is trivial with good team defense is kinda troll. Big time players often carry a huge load in the playoffs, and toast guys one-on-one. You should know considering that’s the reason you got to the finals."
you're gonna call out foul baiting after watching pascal siakam scream like he's getting mauled by a bear every time he takes it to the rim the whole season?

"Think you're looking at the wrong year, Pascal had a 63 TS% the year we won the championship. That's on 3 threes a game too not just taking bunnies and providing no space for others like Simmons does.  Our team D was already so damn good that year I would absolutely have preferred Pascal's overall offensive game to the better individual D from Ben.  Game 1 of the finals we won by 9 and Siakam dropped 32 on 17 shots, that ain't happening with Ben."
Pascal siakam and Ben Simmons seems like a pretty atrocious pairing
Mann is like a smaller Pascal Siakam in that he is older than a lot of people realize and is about to go from being a pleasant surprise to overrated as soon as he gets his next contract.
And then you get to the playoffs and Siakam goes Pandemic Pascal lol
"issue is siakam needs spacing, with simmons, Pascal will just be driving into a clogged paint and turning it over unless he can improve his shot more"
"Randle went from a guy people were talking about being a legit All-NBA player and finally turning the corner into a legit player, to people calling him this year's Pascal Siakam scam."
If I had to watch Ben Simmons and Pascal Siakam on my team I’m quitting my fandom LMAO
I mean Pascal Siakam on his max would still be on the team too.... I just don't see him fitting with Ben.
The majority of people here get downright gleeful whenever Paul George or Pascal Siakam fail. It's really something I can't wrap my head around.
Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis  Pascal Siakam
Philadelphia 76ers 2022 starting 5:       Ben Simmons - Westbrook -  Kuzman - Tobias Harris -  Pascal Siakam     Headcoach:   Scalabrine
Toronto will start being the dumping ground of bad contracts along with Pascal Siakam.
PG: Monte Morris/Jalen Brunson  SG: Shake Milton  SF: Matisse Thybulle/Jalen McDaniels  PF: OG Anunoby/George's Niang  C: Pascal Siakam/Reggie Perry  We don't get draft picks
"Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell or Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam or Macolm Brogdon then we didn't have picks 2 years because of bad trades."
Hot take but both og anunoby and pascal siakam  too many raptors fans I know keep trying to talk them up - I just don't trust it
okay bro enjoy Pascal Siakam 😂😂
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
Raptors' top 15 players not in this postseason:  |1|Pascal Siakam| --:|:--| |2|Fred VanVleet| |3|Norman Powell| |4|Kyle Lowry| |5|OG Anunoby| |6|Chris Boucher| |7|Malachi Flynn| |8|Terence Davis| |9|Aron Baynes| |10|DeAndre' Bembry| |11|Freddie Gillespie| |12|Stanley Johnson| |13|Yuta Watanabe| |14|Paul Watson| |15|Matt Thomas|
"Greg Popovic took Kawhi from role player to Finals MVP &amp; top 5 player. Nick took Pascal Siakam from G-league to 2nd team all-nba. Eric Spoelstra, Brad Stevens. There’s tons of better development coaches than Atkinson and using those weak examples from Brooklyn really doesn’t mean much."
&gt;As for rest of your comment - Jaylen is already a fine #2 scoring option on a championship team  Yeah if Pascal Siakam can be a #2 then Jaylen can be a #2. It's just about building the right team.  Hes a 25ppg scorer with a history of elevating his game for the playoffs. That's more than enough.
Draft Picks are a lottery and getting more lottery tickets is a good thing.  Not all of the stars in the NBA were picked in the top 2.    Past 10 drafts  2010 Best Players  * John Wall (1)  * DeMarcus Cousins (5)  * Gordan Hayward (9)  * Paul George (10)   2011 Best Players  * Kawhi Leonard (15)   * Kyrie Irving (1)   * Kemba Walker (9)   * Klay Thompson (11)   * Jimmy Butler (30)  2012 Best players  * Anthony Davis (1)  * Bradley Beal (3)  * Damien Lillard (6)  * Draymond Green (35)  * Khris Middleton (39)  2013 Best players  * Victor Oladipo (2)  * Giannis Anteokoumpo (15)  * Rudy Gobert (27)  2014 Best Players  * Joel Embiid (3)  * Julius Rangle (7)  * Zach Lavine (13)  * Nikola Jocic (41)  2015 Best Players  * Karl Anthony Towns (1)  * D'Angelo Russell (2)  * Devin Booker (13)  2016 Best players  * Ben Simmons (1)  * Brandon Ingram (2)  * Jaylen Brown (3)  * Domantas Sabonis (11)  * Pascal Siakam (27)  2017 Best players  * Jayson Tatum (3)  * De'Aron Fox (5)  * Donovan Mitchell (13)  * Bam Adebayo (14)  * John Collins (19)  2018 Best players  * Deandre Ayton (1)  * Luca Doncic (3)  * Trae Young (5)  * Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (11)  2019 Best Players  * Zion Williamson (1)  * Ja Morant (2)  2020 Best Players  * La Melo Ball (3)
"He already does a lot well for a 21-year-old, plus he is 7'2.   Celtics were not going to compete for anything with 6'6-6'8 guys playing at Center. Not in a division that has KD, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Julius Randle, Pascal Siakam, Kyrie Irving, &amp; Ben Simmons.   I get that small ball is the trend right now, but the Celtics need a guy who will make elite players like those guys that think twice about driving to the hoop.   Tacko is tall, but got into basketball really late and it shows because he's still very green.   They needed some true bigs that could come in &amp; play right away. And Stevens should sign Brown to a contract that's more in line with a late first round pick to keep him around."
"thank you!! im so glad the criticism siakam was getting has shifted to simmons. yes pascal is not ready to be a first option. but as a second option? he proved himself in the finals. he dropped 32 in game one and had 26 and 10 in the title clinching game. not every player can be a first option and that is ok, but put pascal next to a reliable first option and he will deliver.  what exactly has simmons proved so far? do not want to see these two compared again unless he actually proves his value and that huge contract"
Lol. After this off season You’re best player is Pascal Siakam. Don’t take it so personally.
"Pascal every day. Simmons hasn’t once shown he gives fuck about improving and Siakam, while he took a step back last year, has worked on his game religiously since being drafted 27th. Simmons was drafted first and has regressed since his rookie year so in the long run I’m taking the guy that cares"
"&gt; Compare him to his peers like Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram and Pascal Siakam to name a few who had weaknesses early in their career but improved to develop their offensive game.  Not peers, but Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler were also two guys you wanted the ball far away from while on offense, and look at them now. Avery Bradley is another..."
"and then Nick Nurse updated Kawhi with the New Giannis Anti-Virus, Doctor Lowry found the cure for Cancer, and Pascal Siakam finished watching all the seasons of Beyblade. THE END."
"I just don't understand how he has a clearly identifiable weakness and hasn't made any improvements.      Compare him to his peers like Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram and Pascal Siakam to name a few who had weaknesses early in their career but improved to develop their offensive game.      I guess if I finessed my way into a $160 million contract I'd just play COD and PUBG knowing my life is set regardless."
Probably something like this ignoring injuries:  Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Pascal Siakam  Domantas Sabonis  Malcolm Brogdon  Dejounte Murray  Caris LeVert  Buddy Hield  Malik Beasley  Jakob Poeltl  Ivica Zubac  The rest
Atrocious? That draft has a few allstars and multiple starters- high level starters in it. It’s one of the better drafts we’ve seen in the last decade.   Ben Simmons   Brandon Ingram   Jaylen Brown   Jamal Murray   Pascal Siakam   Domontas Sabonis   Malcolm Brogdon   Dejounte Murray   Caris Levert   Jakob Poeltl   Buddy Hield
"Also a young team in their first few games, they were still figuring things out. We also had Porziņģis playing then. Not really an impressive win when you consider Pascal Siakam was out for them too."
Shaq loves both Pascal and Siakam too.
"Ok... but when is Siakam coming back?  Pascal is great, but we really need that special energy Siakam brings."
And Pascal Siakam
"Pascal ""Siakam"" Siakam"
&gt;	What are the odds this is a Pascal Siakam all over again?  Siakam won a chip bruh. I have no reason to doubt our front office.
Love my two favourite raptors Pascal and Siakam
No Pascal? No Siakam? No Scottie? No Problem.
**2021:** Scottie Barnes (4) and Dalano Banton (46).   **2020:** Malachi Flynn (29).   **2017:** OG Anunoby (23).   **2016:** Pascal Siakam (27) and Jakob Poeltl (9).   **2015:** Delon Wright (20).   He's barely missed. The two who have left have shown to be really tidy players too.
"&gt;I am not even talking about pascal  I mean, you definitely are. This entire conversation is about Siakam."
"I don’t see it. I think spacing is fine as OG qnd to a lesser extend Pascal are good shooters at the perimeter. With all three on the court that would be an suffocating defensive line-up that will make teams pay offensively when they make any defensive mistakes.  Really looking forward to seeing them all together as I expect the starting line-Up, when all are healthy this season, to be:  Siakam OG Barnes FVV GTJ"
"Siakam will be back in a couple of weeks. It's his first time out with a serious injury too. That said, Pascal probably wasn't available unless it was an overpay."
"Do you even watch the Raptors? It's not all about assist numbers it's initiating the offense. Pascal was able to initiate the offense for us last season especially after we sat Lowry. Sure it only increased his APG by 1, but he was a far better playmaker than he was a year ago. If we had last seasons Siakam in the 2020 playoffs, we most likely make it past the Celtics.   This is without mentioning that he caught COVID last year which really messes you up as guys like Tatum are still citing to be feeling the after effects. I guess Tatum also peaked as a player because he's shooting 27% from 3 this season?"
"Oh word? I had no idea.  Not every Max Contract is a bad contract, Siakam is a young enough player on a high dollar contract locked up for the next 3 years. Haliburton may improve linearly, but he also may not and given the trajectory of our team right now, trading Pascal for Haliburton puts our rebuild back 2-3 years, around the time OG and FVV need new contracts while betting that Haliburton will become a star when we already have OG primed to take a big jump and Scottie Barnes looking great.  Yes if we could get a great 2 guard to go with a future of OG at the 3 and Barnes at 4 that would be amazing, but its a swing you don't need to take right now.  Even if you think its a positional improvement it just doesn't make sense in the current environment, especially considering Sacramento isn't one Siakam away from being relevant, they don't make that trade for the timeline/expectation of their team OR for the fact that they'd need to give up considerable pieces as well to make the salaries work.  Yknow not everyone who disagrees with you is a fake fan, its possible they know their team situation better than you do."
"Even if you think the Pascal trade market is softer than most do, Siakam is an established former all star, Haliburton is a promising sophmore.  You don't make that trade nearly ever."
Nobody’s giving up a godfather offer for fucking Pascal Siakam either lol
"""Let me tell you something, I haven't even begun to peak. And when I do peak, you'll know. Because I'm gonna peak so hard that everybody in Toronto's gonna feel it."" - golden god Pascal Siakam"
"How do you think the raptors will fit siakam in? Seems like too much overlap between him and Barnes. I’m intrigued by the idea of running fvv, Trent, og, Barnes and pascal in short stretches. No traditional rim protector, but tons of possible switches on defense."
Man ever since the nerfed spin moves Pascal siakam has been missing
Bruh I love OG but he is not Pascal Siakam
Ok Pascal is coming back. But what about Siakam?
We know Siakam will help.... but have you considered the impact of Pascal coming back as well?  He and Siakam will really get things going.
Also Siakam got shamed in the media. He's really not that bad and last two years have been tough playing away from home. I don't know if Pascal will ever be the ideal first option but the way this club is looking we might not need him to be. Revenge year for sure.
No Scottie Barnes or Pascal siakam this game does not count in my book
Pascal Siakam is doing something similar
"its just that he has raw athleticism and physical attributes that some teams can work with.  if he was in a more stable situation with a more stable team structure it could do wonders for him.     pascal siakam came into the league with nothing much more than height and the raptors turned him into an all-nba player.  he played in the g-league, started from the bottom and now he's a really good nba player  you just have to get him to buy in to the idea of starting from the bottom and working his way up into the lineup.   cause his NBA career is at risk being benched like this, he's gonna go into free agency and not make a lot of money."
"Scottie Barnes,Pascal Siakam,OG,Fred and Gary  Easy"
Pascal Siakam did college in Arizona if memory serves.
"Because precious scottie, bouche, og we have a glut at the forward position and i assume its gonna be hard to give everyone minutes when pascal is back.  Likely precious gets benched but i think masai has a softspot for nigerians and hes young so maybe they trade siakam  He butt heads with nurse last year.   I mean nothing could happen as well.  Who could he net? Simmons,? Not that i want him tho. Maybe masais plan is bigger than all this"
I hear Pascal got demoted.  But at least we still have Siakam.
"Blown out by Atlanta  Beat (Pascal-less, although no one has played the Raptors with Siakam) Raptors by 8  Beat the bad by design Rockets by 10  Beat the Spurs by 5  blown out by Murray-less Nuggets  Their best win has been against the Spurs, and although the Spurs are young and trying, they are clearly a play-in level team."
"First off, Pascal Siakam is very much alive"
They started a petition to send Pascal Siakam back to Africa
“I’m back” - Pascal Siakam
"Imagine you trained all your life to get into the G League, in hopes of making it into the NBA one day and getting a big contract.  Then, in your first G League game, you have to defend against NBA Champion Pascal Siakam LMAO"
"&gt; I am pretty confident there is nobody in China with a body type and athleticism similar to say Scottie Barnes or Pascal Siakam to throw out randoms  Based on what?  I'm serious.  State any factual source that you're basing this on.  Literally, any single factual source.  Or... are you pretty confident based on literally nothing?"
That’s G-league Finals MVP Pascal Siakam
&gt; If Middleton can be a strong #2  List of championship number 2s in reverse chronological order:  2020: anthony davis  2019: pascal siakam  2018: durant or curry  2017: durant or curry  2016: kyrie  2015: klay or dray  2014: kawhi or tony parker  2013: wade  2012: wade  2011: tyson chandler  2010: pau gasol  2009: pau gasol  2008: kg or pierce  2007: tony parker  2006: shaq  2005: tony parker or manu  2004: sheed or billups  2003: stephen jackson??  2002: kobe  2001: kobe  2000: kobe  I think 2003 would be the only year khris would have a strong argument for being the 2nd best player
You got your eyes on Pascal or Siakam?
"In playing fantasy basketball this year, I love how in the updates they'll just blatantly call teams out for tanking:  &gt;Pascal Siakam (shoulder) is not being listed on the injury report for Wednesday's game against the Nets. Spicy P missed one game for rest and another one with a pretend shoulder injury,  &gt;OG Anunonby (calf) is not being listed on the injury report for Wednesday's game vs. Brooklyn. It appears the Raptors have run out of appendages to lie about with OG, so he should be back in action tomorrow night,  &gt;Lu Dort (hip strain, tank violator) will not play on Monday vs. the Wizards for the second leg of the back-to-back. The Thunder are just making injuries appear out of thin air as opposed to calling it rest. Dort has been playing out of his mind lately and would give the Thunder a chance to win vs. the Wizards, so the tanking Thunder can't allow that.  Also on Dort:  &gt;Dort will not play Wednesday against the Warriors due to a sore left shoulder. Dort looked just fine in Tuesday's loss to Utah, when he hit seven threes on his way to 42 points, seven rebounds, four steals and three assists. There was no indication that Dort was dealing with a shoulder issue, so this looks like the Thunder are simply looking to lessen their chances of picking up a win Wednesday night.  They also called Al Horford ""the world's most rested man."""
"Probably Steph or Klay when they hit 60 points and are not being held out of the 4th. You also never know who it could be as guys like Kevin Love and Pascal Siakam have dropped 30 in a quarter before, they just have to stay hot for the rest of the game"
"Mpj with the amazingly quiet 21/7 and the best +/- on the night.   Started cold, 1-6, 0-2 from three in the first half, then went a casual 6-7 and 5-6 from three the rest of the way.   But naw, kid ain't close to being worth a max according to a bunch of people here. According to one he's a worse Pascal Siakam and won't ever be better"
There it is. Steph Curry is a better shooter than Pascal Siakam.
Pascal Siakam on the Mavs would be pretty dope
"LOL shoulda just said ""If Pascal Siakam is your key you are not going far"". We would have nothing to say."
"Because you deleted your comment I’ll reply here:  &gt;mpj has dominant stretches defensively   His defense isn’t good. It’s not just about playing on ball D. If he lets his guy just run past him off ball and get an easy cut to layup that isn’t good. That happens a lot. He doesn’t have the speed to prevent top tier wings from blowing past him either.   It’s like how people on r/nba say that Donovan, pascal siakam, or jaylen brown are “plus defenders”.   They are all pretty mediocre defenders because their off ball skills are bad (except siakam). MPJ is in the same vein, but not nearly as good on ball as those 3.   And 2 years of coaching isn’t that far from “being on the court”.  There are tons of guys like terry rozier who mostly get their experience from practice early on rather than game time. Practice makes them improve just as much. Just throwing a random rookie and giving him minutes isn’t some magical way to “improve” a player. He doesn’t magically have a way steeper growth curve than the other guys in his draft class because of playing time.   MPJ is a one way play finisher who puts up decent stats on easy buckets. His contract will probably be slightly less than what the raptors gave siakam, who is a significantly better player (though older). That’s about 25 mil a year."
Pascal Siakam
"&gt; Pascal in his rookie year was as good if not better than Yuta is currently is.  I think you need to go back and watch early Pascal, because that's just a wild statement there. His rookie stats are so similar to Yuta's current stats if we go [by BBREF](https://stathead.com/tiny/npDLm) it's kind of eerie, but Yuta wins out on percentages by a mile. From the eye test as well, Yuta has much more in terms of handles as well compared to early Siakam.  &gt; It’s foolish to expect other players to go through the same development when it doesn’t happen 99% of the time.  I never said that though? I just said I hope for more... I know he's the same age as Pascal and Fred right now and he's behind the development curve, but I think the Raps development staff will make him into a more consistent rotation player than the players you mentioned.  I think at this point we can reasonably say that Yuta will improve given the Raptors development track record over the last decade."
&gt; that's going to stomp the league in a few years  30 year old Pascal Siakam/Fred VanVleet are so scary.
"&gt;Even before the NBA season began, things were already weird for the Toronto Raptors. They were about to get weirder.   &gt;The pandemic forced the Raptors to become NBA snowbirds as they relocated from Toronto to Tampa, Fla., where there are palm trees outside and “We the North” signage inside, a move that turned out to be the beginning of a season that would make absolutely no sense.   &gt;They have since become the league’s most puzzling anomaly. There are good teams and bad teams every year in the NBA, but there has never really been a team like the Raptors. They’re either a bad team that’s good—or a good team that’s bad.   &gt;This is how much of an outlier they are: The difference between the Raptors’ expected number of wins based on their statistics and their actual number of wins is the largest of any team with a positive net rating in at least three decades, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Stathead data.   &gt;There have been 39 teams in NBA history with losing records and positive point differentials, meaning they outscored their opponents for the season and still lost more games than they won. Most were barely under .500. There is one notable exception. The lowest winning percentage on this list of basketball aberrations would belong to this season’s greatest source of dissonance: the Toronto Raptors in Tampa.   &gt;They appear to be the best, worst NBA team of all time.   &gt;The Raptors are currently sitting in 11th place in the Eastern Conference with a 22-34 record after being ravaged by the coronavirus and living away from home while most people are stuck working from home.   &gt;If the NBA playoffs started today instead of next month, they wouldn’t even qualify for the league’s first play-in tournament. Not making the playoffs when more teams than ever will make the playoffs would be a huge disappointment, and it might even make sense at this point to bottom out temporarily and increase their lottery odds in a tantalizing draft.   &gt;But what makes the Raptors more interesting than other bad teams with tanking incentives is that it’s still not clear if they’re one of them. They have the mathematical profile of a team that’s actually good.   &gt;A funny thing about the NBA is that a team’s win-loss record is not always the most reliable metric of whether it’s good or bad, since that number is subject to luck, random variation, statistical noise and so many other vagaries of playing sports. A better measure in the short term is a team’s net rating—the point differential per 100 possessions—and the Raptors have outscored their opponents. Their net rating is higher than the teams in seventh, eighth, ninth and 10th place in the East.   &gt;There is even a stat called Pythagorean wins that predicts a team’s expected record from the number of points it scores and allows. It was devised by the pioneering baseball quant Bill James and then applied to basketball by Philadelphia 76ers president Daryl Morey when he was a Stats Inc. researcher as a college student.  &gt;But not even a formula designed by the greatest analytical minds in sports and named after a Greek philosopher’s theorem is powerful enough to crack this NBA team.   &gt;The numbers suggest the Raptors should be 29-27. Instead they are 22-34.   &gt;Those numbers are skewed by their peculiar ability to win big and lose close games. The Raptors have somehow won nearly the same number of games by 20 points or more and 10 points or fewer. They also had six game-winning or game-tying shots in the final seconds of the fourth quarter before April—and missed them all. That helps explain why they would be the first team ever to outscore their opponents and lose more than 60% of their games.   &gt;That’s also part of the confusion. They have the statistical indicators of a good team and the record of a bad team. So which is it?   &gt;The answer is probably both, but it’s a tricky question. One of the more trivial difficulties of playing basketball during a pandemic is that it’s hard to tell what to make of a team. The season is shorter. The games are packed tighter. The arenas are emptier. Add injuries and Covid protocols. Subtract home-court advantage. What do you get?  &gt;“A season unlike any other,” said Jack Armstrong, the Raptors’ television analyst for the last 23 years.   &gt;But when it comes to evaluating any team this season, it’s hard to ignore the massive purple dinosaur in the room.   &gt;The NBA has managed to plow ahead with minimal disruptions and, like the rest of the country, can see light at the end of the tunnel with players getting vaccinated and fans trickling back into arenas. The worst seems to be over. But in a sport where one case and the subsequent contact tracing can wipe out an entire team, this season was inevitably going to favor teams that were spared the wrath of a microscopic pathogen.   &gt;Toronto wasn’t one of them. Raptors players have missed 114 days because of Covid-19 protocols, according to a Fansure study of the league’s injury reports. Only the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics were hit so hard.   &gt;Their exposure started with a Feb. 26 announcement that coach Nick Nurse and five members of his staff would be working remotely while sidelined by the league’s health and safety protocols, followed by Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby being out for more than two weeks each. The Raptors had three games postponed and then lost nine straight from March 3 to March 22—and the Covid-related free fall could have been worse if not for a weeklong break for the All-Star Game.   &gt;At the beginning of March, when their record was 17-17, they could squint at glimmers of hope. By the end of March, when they were dealing with the human toll of being demolished by Covid, losing 13 of 14 games and nearly trading Kyle Lowry, they were staring into the NBA abyss.   &gt;“Pretty much everything that could possibly happen,” Armstrong said, “happened.”   &gt;There are still reasons to believe this might be a good team disguised as a bad one.   &gt;It’s why the more obviously good teams aren’t exactly clamoring to play the 2019 champions if they can sneak into the playoffs. As far as first-round opponents for the Brooklyn Nets, Philadelphia 76ers or Milwaukee Bucks go, this one would have the rough appeal of wrestling a velociraptor.   &gt;And it wouldn’t be entirely surprising if the Raptors do something else that no team with a losing record has done in three decades: win a playoff series."
"It’s a wash in terms of value and then you’re shaking up chemistry for no reason. They’re also quite similar players in terms of role, being great scoring options. If CJ was to be traded, it would be for a guy like 2018-19 Pascal Siakam, someone who can do it all relatively well but isn’t a top player in any specific area of the game."
"Ok we know about Pascal, but what about Siakam?"
No Pascal/OG/Siakam/Lowry and they've won 2 games.  holy shit do OKC/Orlando stink
clearly they meant either pascal or siakam
"That's a kind of selection bias, you're focusing on players who stuck in the league.  Also I don't think most of those guys are enormously better than they were as rookies, most just got more of a chance and are more sure of their strengths and weaknesses, and some improved their shooting a bit.  But think about the counter examples.  Off the top of my head just from our team I recall Grievis Vasquez, Nick Calathes, Sam Young, Hakim Warrick, Stromile Swift, Dahntay Jones, and O.J. Mayo (wasn't old but was picked because of polish on his game, a floor pick).  They got chances to play early on but they just kinda were who they were for their whole careers.  Mayo even got clearly worse his whole career.  And when you open it up to guys who were never even good enough to get a chance that list grows by leaps and bounds.    For every Pascal Siakam there are 5 or 10 players like Michael Carter-Williams and Doug McDermott."
Siakam is trash. Trade him. We can build our team around Pascal.
"Those jimmies were definitely rustled, and at the time it was statistically comparable.  But watching their games... man you can tell Tatum had that scoring bag since he was a teenager, compared to Pascal who excels when he has the length/quickness advantage, but you can tell his offensive game is not as refined as Jayson... it's miles wide at this point lol  With ALL that being said though, when he's engaged Pascal Siakam is an elite defender. So I look forward to the rest of the team improving offensively so that Pascal can focus on defense, run the floor, hit open shots and not be pegged into that lead offensive initiator role that Jayson is more comfortable in."
"is it? just looking at old drafts i see guys like draymond green, khris middleton, spencer dinwiddie, will barton, jae crowder, jimmy butler, jerami grant, joe harris, malcolm brogdon, josh richardson, pascal siakam, dillon brooks, kyle anderson, etc, etc.. who were picked late that definitely improved from their rookie year to later career, and some of them were older when they were drafted too. dudes who prove themselves to be nba material will usually make some strides early in their career as they adjust to the speed and physicality of the nba. plus, having million dollar contracts on the line is a good incentive to hone your skills. i think the problem is that not many people in the 2nd round are nba material to begin with.  if youre talking about ""jumping tiers"" uhh sure, i dont think bane will be an all star, but there's enormous variance in the value of non all stars. if he can be even a top 100 player in the nba, how is that not a steal?  like half of the top 10 in a lot of drafts are busts.   also grayson was bad his rookie year, ask any jazz fan. true shooting percentage is 10% higher now with more volume and he can actually play defense. 40 pt game came on 11/30 shooting."
"This is how bad he is.  This lineup:  Fred VanVleet, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, Chris Boucher, Khem Birch  Is better than this lineup:  Fred Vanvleet, Kyle Lowry, OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Aaron Baynes.  Khem Birch is such an upgrade that him plus G-Leaguers is better than 2 all-stars and OG."
HS Wiggins would def give Pascal “The Human Beyblade” Siakam a run for his money
Siakam is not better than JB. Pascal on the other hand might have a case.
That's 2nd team all nba pascal Siakam to you
Personally I like Pascal - but not Siakam
Can't wait for Pascal - Siakam in 20 years

"Pascal, despite all the missed shots in the 4th, Siakam."
"8 man playoff rotation:   - Kawhi Leonard - Kyle Lowry - Pascal Siakam - Fred VanVleet - Norman Powell - Marc Gasol - Serge Ibaka - Danny Green  and OG Anunoby had an emergency appendectomy the eve of the playoffs and missed the entire postseason  The deepest team I've ever watched as a Raps fan. Zero defensive weak points and balanced offense across the entire roster. Shooting and scoring from all 3 levels, great playmakers and finishers, and subbing in Nick Nurse for Casey put them over the top."
"Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry and Kawhi Leonard carried that team. 0 bad defenders in that group."
I give a lot of the efficiency issues to him being the primary focus of the offense and being new to the role.  It’s the same thing that just happened to Julius Randle this year and Pascal Siakam last year. They still need help from others instead of being relied upon heavy like they were.  As for athleticism you don’t exactly need a ton of it to thrive in the NBA.
"This is an interesting post, but I think going back 20 years is a BIT too far since the criteria in the 2000s was entirely different than the criteria in the 2010s. In the 2000s, the award generally favored guys that were drafted mid-late first round or in the 2nd round. Basically they were given to guys who weren't really expected to be good coming into the league but ended up breaking out. Players like Bobby Simmons, Aaron Brooks, Boris Diaw, etc all fit that bold - guys who were drafted outside of the lottery who had an amazing season for their standards.   If we're looking at the past 10 seasons, every winner for the award was either a first time all star/all NBA or played a very key role on a playoff team. The only winners that didn't make an all star team/all NBA the team were Ryan Anderson, CJ and Pascal Siakam.   Ryan Anderson was a typical 2000s MIP, 21st pick who reached a career high in scoring (at that time) and played a critical role in his team's success. However, if we were to pick the award based on today's criteria I'd wager that Andrew Bynum most likely would've gotten the nod over him. CJ despite being a lottery pick increased his PPG from 6 to 20, and Siakam went from a stiff to a 2nd option on a championship level team despite not making an all star team that year.   If I'm a betting man looking at next year's potential winner based on the pattern for the past decade, it's going to be someone that either makes their first all star/all NBA team or someone that plays a huge role on a playoff level team whose numbers improved tremendously.   Zion/Zach - I'm going to write these guys off because they're already too good, and have already made an all star team. I don't think we've ever had an all star level player get the MIP even if they made a jump to a MVP worthy season. Steph Curry didn't get it, Derrick Rose didn't get it, I don't see the case for Zion or Zach Lavine.   Shai - He's already putting up 24/5/6 on great efficiency, basically numbers that Brandon Ingram put up when he won it. He can obviously get better, but how much better can he even get at this point to get MIP? The opportunity is there, but it just feels so unlikely that he improves SO much from last season that he wins it IMO.   MPJ - Probably has the best odds to make it IMO. He has the talent and most importantly the opportunity with Jamal Murray out for most of the season. If he can take on more of the scoring load and put up around 25PPG on similar efficiency &amp; improve his defense while making the all star/all NBA team the award is as good as his.   I'm not going to bet on any of the sophomores, because historically you need to see a HUGE improvement to win MIP as a sophomore. Improvements from lottery picks like Edwards/Williams would be expected, and Bane would have to average 20PPG which I don't see happening given his role.   Guys like JJJ/Garland/other top 5 picks would really have to get their first all star selection in order to be in the conversation for MIP. I just don't really see it for those guys right now. Injuries aside, I just don't see JJJ make the all star team this upcoming season over Ja, and I DEFINITELY don't see the Grizzlies have more than one all star player.   I really like OG at those odds, he just fits the criteria the NBA is looking for in their MIPs IMO. The only things he really needs to be a good offensive player at this point are tighter handles which he has reportedly been working on all summer. It's really hard to judge the Raptors right now because their season in Tampa was so unorthodox, nobody knows how much playing away from Toronto has affected their player. If the Raptors look good before all star break and OG is putting up 20PPG + great defense, he could very well sneak into an all star game and end the season on an all defense team. +5000 odds I feel like this is a no brainer.  In regards to NAW, I love NAW but I just don't see opportunity for him to take a huge leap like that. The Pelicans already have two stars in Zion &amp; Ingram, how many minutes/shots are realistically going to be available for NAW? I guess not having Bledsoe/Lonzo on the team anymore helps his case, but we also have to consider that they also brought in JV who's going to command a LOT more touches than Adams. I feel like the minutes might be there, but the opportunity might not necessarily be there. But then again, his PER 36 stats do look good so at +3000 it's still pretty good.   Anyways, my picks for MIP so far is probably MPJ/OG/NAW."
"Honestly. Perhaps at the beginning of last year they may have gotten a nice return on him but right now, the best player I think they could get for him is a Pascal Siakam, CJ McCollum (hard maybe) or a top 10 pick."
"&gt;	Now you’re just being an idiot.   Grant, OG, Brogdon, Myles Turner, FVV, Wood… all make around 20M and are better players than Wiggins. He is definitely overpaid by a lot.         &gt;	Raptors are the one dangling Siakam to other teams.  Yeah, because we don’t have a first option to put in front of Pascal. We aren’t trying to move him because he is a bad player."
"&gt;	Siakam’s contract is longer than Wiggins and is worth more per year.   Probably because he is a much better player. Pascal is a proven top 3 player on a championship squad, and that’s worth a max. Andrew Wiggins is a league average player making max money.           &gt;	He shot sub 30% from 3 last year   Warriors fans keep bringing it up as if Pascal is a perimeter player. He is a big man that can take an open shot. And he has made that shot at a good rate any season that he hasn’t been on a road for aj entire year.           &gt;	The most I’d give up is Wiggins and 14 and really I’m not too interested in Siakam to even give that up.    Looool, Warriors fans talking about how they are not interested when their FO and top players have Pascal and Beal as their top targets."
Toronto needs a true first option scorer. Siakam is best in the second option roll. Ben Simmons isn’t even a good second option.  Pascal for Ben is just doubling down on the weaknesses Toronto has as a team.
If Pascal Siakam wore 100 we would call him P90X
"Alright you can have Pascal as long as we get Siakam, seems like a fair trade."
"He had a disappointing first few months in the NBA and finished his rookie season on a VERY strong note, especially the last two months. He then continued to carried that success into this season and was slowly improving every week before he ultimately went down to injury.  It's not just the potential, we've seen what he can do and what he has done. Does he have consistency issues? Yes he does. Most rookies do. Most rookies also do not show such vast improvements in such a short time as he has.   That's the problem with folks on /r/nba. The majority of ya'll expect these young guys to be these complete basketball players right out the gate and your delusions cloud the reality. They're not. A lot start of slow, some start of strong, and the rare few are All-Stars year 1. I remember this subreddit clowning the Raptors fans for defending Pascal Siakam from day one. The fans who watched him play everyday and saw the potential versus the clowns who may have caught him on a bad day playing against their team who somehow thought their opinion was high and mighty based on a 1 or 2 game sample.  So many of you choose to ignore the improvements he has made and are stuck on how slow he started of his NBA career. It's frustrating."
"Most of the answers in this thread are multi-time ALL NBA players who likely would already be in the top 15 likeliest players to win MVP coming into the year. (PG13, Embiid, etc)  Guys like Trae, Tatum, Booker, Lavine, Beal, etc are all good answers as they have proven to be elite players, but they arent too exciting as ""dark horse"" candidates.  I think guys like LaMelo Ball who are in that next tier down (at least coming into the year) are more fun to take a guess at.   If i was spitballing some ideas of high quality players that could thrive with experience or with a new team situation that make for good 'dark horse' options:   **LaMelo Ball**   - CHA could finish a top 4 seed in theory. LaMelo is a great talent and likely has voters attention off of RoY campaign  **Pascal Siakam**   - could be the leader of a team that makes solid playoff spot. Good mix of counting stats   **Brandon Ingram**   - if hes in the mix its likely because of Zion being an MVP himself, but if they elevate NOP to a high seed and BI elevates his game he could be worth keeping an eye on  **Ja Morant**/**Jaren Jackson**   - Memphis has been an exciting team and can fight for higher seed. Both players are great young talents. JJJ could sneak in if he has great block numbers to go with his scoring"
"I think he means GS gets Pascal, not that the Raptors get the Warriors assets. There would be a 4th team involved. E.g. a framework like  Simmons -&gt; Toronto  Siakam -&gt; GS  Wiggins, Wiseman, 7, 14 -&gt; Washington  Beal -&gt; Philly  Something like that and then you can add the remaining salaries/picks."
"If I were to guess Siakam is the guy who gets moved. Now idk I'd want that but like Morey wants an all star calibur player back, and theres been some smoke on us moving Pascal. And Embiid probably pushes for it too since Siakam is his compatriot"
"yes, imo. he was arguably better than Kobe at his absolute zenith, there's no reason to believe he wouldn't be among the 3-6 range. his issue was injuries more than anything. he was good at everything and fucking huge for today's NBA. he was like Pascal Siakam with a Kobe-esque skillset, so he could be a gigantic 2 when he was younger and could guard 2s or he'd just be the best scoring 3/4 outside of Durant. lol"
"pascal was 4/13 FG and 1/4 from 3 in his first game against those nets lol  6/14 the next game  11/23 the next  9/22 the last  siakam is an excellent player but that's not what this is about, the dude just wasn't right in the bubble. these are not good numbers against a thoroughly covid/injury depleted team lol"
"I don’t agree that they play at the 5 when it matters most. I think they play at the 5 when their traditional big isn’t performing or there is a matchup to be exploited.  That said, my point is that while most GMs and coaches would prefer everyone on the court to have a triple, I don’t think a three-pointer is a prerequisite for a successful PF: Giannis, Draymond, Pascal Siakam, Aaron Gordon, Zion Williamson don’t have a triple or have only shown it in spurts.  I’ll agree with you that these guys are increasingly anomalies and a PF with a 3 is generally preferred over one without, though."
"Eh realistically the 4 is an inconsistent position. Modern SG/SFs are simply better ballhandlers + playmakers + shooters so they get more touches. Unless you're KD/Giannis/Zion who rightfully deserve to be the focal points of the offensive scheme. Or Anthony Davis who is the best at filling in all the gaps.  Even Pascal Siakam has shot 55% TS the past two years, lower than the league average 57%. And is now in trade rumors."
"I think Pascal and Embiid would play amazingly together.     Make that the primary piece for Simmons.     You'd need to give more but I think you can balance that out with a secondary trade including Lowry.     PHI: Lowry, Siakam   TOR: Simmons     It's just about the secondary parts that support the trade to be balanced (as defined by each side)"
"Why not ask for pascal siakam, Kyle Lowry, the fourth pick, and a bag of chips too if Morey is offering delusional trades?"
"A season ago, Siakam shot 36% from 3 on 6 attempts per game.   He struggled this season, playing through injuries.   Pascal is a very, very good player."
He is there to help pascal siakam  take his next step.  A player who drops 32 in a game 1 finals has potential to be a superstar. They don’t know why he stop progressing.
It’s pascal siakam… and why would warriors trade klay and their future for jalen brown and a guy who can only spin?
"I can see why Nurse would love to have Simmons.  The mans a defense first coach, if you ain't playing defense he'll pull you out the game in a heartbeat. Ben despite his shooting issues is one of the best/ most versatile defenders in the league. Assuming we could keep OG and Siakam, that would beat one of the most lethal trios in the NBA on that end. The schemes would be madness. That's probably why we may be so interested in Simmons.  However, that goes out the door when it's just OG and Simmons, or Pascal and Simmons. It's got to be all three together. Then you figure out what you want to build around them.  But if it stays like this? It's an immediate non-starter. Hanging up the phone immediately. OG or Siakam cannot go the other way in a deal for Simmons."

Siakam was a top 3 player on a championship team before. Steph/Dray/Pascal/70% of Klay would be a championship calibre squad.

"I honestly can't fathom the stupidity of people making broad opinions on players from tiny sample sizes. It just blows my mind, especially when both performances project to being possible outliers for their careers, for Simmons a possible career low and for Pascal, a career high that just so happened to occur two years ago, which is even more idiotic. Siakam had a -2.0 BPM last playoffs, averaged 17ppg on 39% shooting and just 18% from three. He wasn't good enough to get his team into the playoffs this year. Simmons' team was the #1 seed and he was 1st team All Defense this season while Siakam didn't even sniff an all league nomination. Are you starting to appreciate how dumb this line of thinking is?"
"Next year's playoffs will be 7 years from their last title without KD, Klay will not be the same guy, Dray might be the worst scoring starter in the league, Iggy is gone, Barnes is gone, Bogut is gone, Livingston is gone.  Pascal Siakam or someone in that same tier will not make this team a contender."
"Depends on the scenario but some of these have just been insane.  Give up Wiseman and two lottery picks to upgrade Wiggins to...Pascal Siakam?  I get that they kinda have to trade the picks before the draft but I'd really like to see the team play a bit before doing anything if I'm them.  Maybe Wiseman will make the Sophomore leap, maybe Klay is basically Joe Harris now.  Just hate how basketball is feeling more and more like baseball with teams being all-in or going full rebuild."
"This is Masai; everyone's available for the right price. But if we trade Pascal, it means we're blowing it up, which means the 4th pick is staying right where it is. And that's only happening for a big haul, which I don't think anyone is offering for Pascal, because the media undervalues him. Maybe some front office does see a lot of value in him and decides to pony up, but it's unlikely.  Meanwhile, I'd love to trade for Dame, but that only makes sense to contend NOW, which we're not doing if we trade Siakam. So I guess this writer is a moron."
"Simmons is younger. Pascal is in his prime now and the Raptors should be rebuilding, not competing. If you can trade Siakam for Simmons and other assets it would probably be worth it to start a rebuild and put shooters around Simmons as you build up his value to flip later on  With that said, they could also just trade Siakam for assets or other prospects too. Also I don’t think Siakam really fits well on the Sixers either"
Everyone's obsessed with blockbuster star trades but it makes no sense for the Raptors.  I know there was some friction between Nick Nurse and Pascal Siakam throughout the season which could be the reason Siakam gets traded otherwise I think this is just the Raptors doing their due diligence.
"Bleacher Report is such trash. I stopped reading ay this:  &gt;Toronto, for example, could offer a package centered on the No. 4 selection and Pascal Siakam  Lmao."
"This is way too much for beal, at least for our current situation. I'm not a fan. We could just re-sign GTJ and pick suggs and TBH id feel better about that. Beal is great but in the next 3~ years beal will be 31, fvv 30-31, siakam 30-31 and if we trade GTJ and this pick we don't really have another bench mob to replace them down the line.  All the reasons you think this is a great trade for the Wiz are all the reasons that it becomes tough. We can't win with Beal/Pascal on maxes and OG making 20+m a year. That's basically the whole team."
"OG, Beal, Siakam, Lowry is hype tbh. Not sure it could contain Giannis or Embiid but we'd get to see if Pascal really is a legitimate number 2 option or if 2019 teams just weren't prepared for him like they are now."
A lot of these pascal &gt; Simmons comments in this thread would turn into “Siakam isn’t even all that”
Terance Mann will go from being a role player to an emerging star.  He's going to take that 2019 Pascal Siakam type leap.
"AD is only 28. I feel like hes been around so long, in comparison giannis is 26 and pascal siakam is 27"
"They can trade Looney + Wiseman instead of Wiggins + Wiseman for Wood, while Looney + Wiseman for Myles Turner or Pascal Siakam doesn't work"
"This is such a tautology.  He's an all star so he's worth an all star, but maybe the league has gotten his impact wrong as a career 16 point player and he's just a product of hype and media narrative.  We shouldn't sucker ourselves into believing that he will contribute to winning as an average replacement All Star could given what we've seen from him across his career and in the Playoffs.   Pascal Siakam is a former All Star, got on All-NBA team higher than Simmons did, but you couldn't say ""we won't trade Pascal for anything but an All-Star""."
"&gt;	Siakam is 100% more like a Bam, Dray, Giannis type of defensive player but not as good than a shut down perimeter defensive player.   Pascal is more perimeter oriented than all these players. In fact, he actually never plays as a center (OG at 5 is what they were doing with small ball 5), but all these guys do.        There are also different layers to perimeter defense. Beal and KD both initate the offense from the perimeter, but you need different type of players for guarding them.              If Pascal could guard PGs and SGs as good as he guards SFs and PFs he would have been a perennial all-defense player. He can’t so he is a little below that but that’s still much better than Andrew Wiggins."
"&gt;	Siakam cannot take the best scoring guard on the other team. He’s good in spurts but a whole night on someone like Beal? torched.  Can Giannis? Can Dray? Can Gobert? Can Bam?          Yeah, you want Pascal to guard SFs and PFs, but he would do an okay job being switched into other players.            I have never seen anyone target Pascal on switches."
"Yeah, I have been following Andrew for years, I really wanted him to succeed and I always root for him. But he is now getting compared to Pascal Siakam?"
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
"I'm a Kings fan, our lottery luck is terrible, but we picked Tyreek Evans over Steph, DMC over PG13, Jimmer Ferdette over Klay, Thomas Roberson over Lillard, McLemore over CJ McCollum, Nik Stauskas over Lavine, WCS over Booker, Georgios Papagiannis over Pascal Siakam, (I'm fine with Fox over Mitchell in 17), Bagley over Luka, and I'm happy with Haliburton in 2020.  In 11 drafts we picked the wrong player every time but 2 (maybe 3 depending on how you feel about Boogie vs PG13, but I hated Boogie by the end of his Kings run, so I think it was the wrong pick just because the guy was a cancer).  So, we can't really blame bad lottery luck, the warriors built a dynasty on picks taken after the Kings picks."
"i actually think siakam would be perfect offensively. After Kawhi left we've tried to force him to be the #1 option but Pascal is at his best when he's creating offense off of hustle plays and through actions with a PG that's a scoring threat. He can pass, rebound, drive and play in the post, but he's also decent at spotting up. That coupled with the defensive versatility would be huge for you guys"
"**Players better than him:** Lebron, Kawhi, Giannis, KD, Curry, CP3, Booker, Mitchell, Jokic, Dame, Luka, Harden, Trae, PG13, AD, (healthy) Kyrie, Beal, Butler, Embiid, Tatum, Westbrook, KAT     **Players he is better than:** Jamal, Blake, Lowry, Porzingis, Tobias, Draymond, Collins, Van Vleet, Brooks, Simmons, Holiday, Randle, Wall, Oladipo, Sabonis, Vucevic, Shai, Lamelo Ball, etc. etc.     **Players he is more or less on the same level with:** Jaylen Brown, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Ja Morant, Pascal Siakam, Deangelo Russell, Zach Lavine, Demar Derozan"
"Siakam is a better defender everywhere. He has a much larger frame, and he has great lateral quickness.          Pascal was the best perimeter defender on a championship winning team. The difference between the two is that Pascal can actually force a stop here and there but Wiggins gives you average defense every position at best.            Pascal was a top 3 player on a championship team, the year after he was an allstar starter and allnba second team as a first option. These comparisons with Wiggins are laughable."
"getting wiggins/wiseman and a lotto pick for a 27yo siakam who has had 2 poor seasons since signing a big contract is a very good deal for toronto.   siakam could ball out playing with curry/klay and it would still be a good trade for toronto. unless masai is planning on trading for a superstar, pascal in toronto will never be as good as he would be in GS."
"&gt;Some on the Golden State Warriors are watching closely the next move of Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal. Should he become available, he’s at the top of the offseason wishlist.  &gt;The Warriors’ trio of stars — Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson — have made it clear to management they want the franchise to focus on the pursuit of a championship, even to consider using their two lottery picks to get someone who can help immediately, sources confirmed. Warriors general manager Bob Myers said their goal this offseason is to add more of a veteran presence.  &gt;Should the Warriors go that route, Beal, the Washington Wizards’ guard who made third-team All-NBA, is deemed to be the best player and best fit for the Warriors among the players who could potentially be available this offseason.  &gt;Of course, “available” is the operative word. Beal to this point, publicly, has held firm in his stance he would not request a trade from the Wizards. He has two years left on his deal worth $71.8 million, including a $37.3 million player option for 2022-23. So Washington really only has team control for one more season and, after hiring Wes Unseld Jr. as their new head coach, might be ripe for a slower rebuild.  &gt;Beal attended Team USA camp in Las Vegas along with Green and Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who is an assistant coach for the Olympic men’s basketball team. Beal did not travel to Tokyo after being placed in health and safety protocols.  &gt;Blazers guard Damian Lillard, who has been rumored to be unhappy with Portland and a threat to demand a trade, was another desired player if he were to become available. But Lillard has clarified he has not demanded a trade and multiple sources said the Warriors don’t suspect Lillard would want to come to the Bay.  &gt;The interest in Beal (and Lillard) underscores the prioritizing of another reliable offensive creator. Golden State had the 20th-ranked offense even with Curry averaging a career-high 32 points on 48.2 percent shooting.  &gt;Beal, who finished runner up to Curry for the scoring title, would significantly bolster the talent and explosiveness on the roster. He’s a preferred target over the Raptors’ Pascal Siakam, who has been a rumored option for Golden State. Beal would give the Warriors shooting and another offensive creator — two elements they need badly to take the pressure off Curry. One of the best scorers in the league, Beal can also carry the team should Curry have to miss some time.  &gt;At 6-foot-3 and reputed as a subpar defender, Beal doesn’t fit the Warriors’ typical mold for an NBA off guard. But his strength and physicality create some hope Beal could contribute on defense if he bought in on that end of the floor. Undoubtedly, some of the optimism comes from the strides Andrew Wiggins made in a defense anchored by Green.  &gt;Beal could only be acquired through a trade, which was expected by many during the trade deadline earlier this year. But Beal reiterated his intentions to stay with Washington, and the Wizards rallied to make the playoffs as the No. 8 seed, losing in the first round to Philadelphia in five games.  &gt;If Beal to the Warriors is even possible, it would likely have to happen before next week’s draft. The Warriors’ No. 7 and No. 14 picks would almost assuredly be included in a package for Beal. Golden State would likely have to add a future pick as well. The clear preference for the Warriors’ veterans — Curry is 33 years old, Green and Thompson are both 31— is to go all-in for these next few years instead of restocking the regular roster with players who could take years to develop.  &gt;Any deal involving Beal would have to include Andrew Wiggins to make the salaries match. Wiggins has two years, $65.2 million remaining on his contract. One team source did say the Warriors wouldn’t be quite willing to gut the roster to acquire Beal. If they could land Beal while keeping James Wiseman, it could be the best of both worlds for the Warriors — appease the desire to win now while retaining a future centerpiece. But Washington figures to want Wiseman.  &gt;The Warriors are expecting to get Thompson back after two years missed due to injuries. But after sustaining a torn right ACL in 2019 and a torn left Achilles in 2020, it is unknown at what level Thompson will be when he returns. Kevin Durant’s ability to play at a high level coming off an Achilles injury allows for some confidence in Thompson’s return, but just his presence would be much-needed help for Curry, who put up an MVP-caliber season on a team with inexperienced players in key positions.  &gt;Golden State went 2-7 in the nine games Curry missed, which landed them in the play-in tournament where they were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies. The Warriors had a .587 win percentage in games Curry played. A .583 win percentage was good for a three-way tie for the No. 5 seed in the West.  &gt;Barring a seemingly improbable trade for a star, the Warriors’ options are to use the picks and hope to land a player who can be a contributor by season’s end, then use free agency to fill gaps with veteran talent. The Warriors have the taxpayer mid-level exception and veteran minimum exceptions to use. They also have the option of finding a sign-and-trade partner for Kelly Oubre Jr., a free agent who isn’t expected to return to the Warriors."
"Pascal Siakam, his stock has dropped considerably on here since the bubble happened.  Outside of his 3pt shooting, he's improved on every level of his game this season in his 2nd year as the #1 option, despite playing out of position as a centre, catching COVID, living in a hotel for most of the season, etc."
"&gt; you can’t exactly wait for new draftees to pan out for another 3-4 years because you have Pascal and Fred who are both 27.    Why not? Siakam and Fred at 30/31 are not old by any means and will be in their primes by then when the #4, GTJ, and OG are starting to come into their own. You need a mix of vets and young stars in your core to compete, not everybody the same age"
Same injury and surgery Pascal Siakam just had.
"Pascal Siakam has a great story too, that's for sure! So many great stories in the NBA. Man I love basketball."
The anxiety I would feel if I just showed up to work at McDonalds in 2019 and Pascal Siakam said “you on my live with 150k people say hi”  Like fam that’s a stadium watching me right there
"**Team Africa**  C: Joel Embiid, Precious Achiuwa.  PF: Pascal Siakam, Chimezie Metu, KZ Okpala.   SF: Josh Okogie, Luc Mbah a Moute.  SG: Victor Oladipo, DJ Strawberry.  PG: Miye Oni, Gabe Vincent."
