Jerami Grant this year is an ex of a guy putting up stats on an awful team but who still has a massive positive on/off differential
"Hollinger hasn't said a word about Jerami Grant (a guy who is a possible All-Star and MIP Player) since the season started, but spent the off-season incessantly ripping the signing."
"Huh?  He's not very different from his typical career season.  Your numbers are off too.  The only major difference is he's been shooting the 3-ball better, but that is more likely a hot streak than something sustainable.  Bottom line, he's not even a candidate.  Jerami Grant or Christian Wood look like leading contenders right now.  Jaylen Brown has a strong argument too, but he won't get the award given his steady development path."
"East front court is stacked but I definitely think he makes it. Here is a table of the players that I think are genuine contenders for an All-Star spot in the East front court, with the players I deem to current be a lock bolded. Sabonis is 90% of the way to being a lock and I'd be really surprised if he didn't make it at this stage.        |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS‚ñº|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |**Kevin Durant**|F|E|BRK|16|30.9|7.4|5.6|0.8|1.4|2.9|0.520|0.447|0.873| |**Joel Embiid**|F|E|PHI|16|28.3|11.1|2.8|1.2|1.3|1.2|0.544|0.404|0.840| |**Giannis Antetokounmpo**|F|E|MIL|19|27.3|11.0|5.7|1.1|1.1|1.2|0.558|0.280|0.593| |**Jayson Tatum**|F|E|BOS|13|26.8|7.0|3.7|1.2|0.7|3.1|0.484|0.435|0.833| |Jerami Grant|F|E|DET|20|23.6|5.9|2.9|0.9|1.1|2.6|0.448|0.402|0.866| |Gordon Hayward|F|E|CHO|20|23.0|5.3|3.6|1.3|0.6|2.3|0.503|0.430|0.856| |Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá|F|E|ORL|21|22.6|10.9|3.5|1.1|0.5|2.7|0.478|0.441|0.837| |Julius Randle|F|E|NYK|22|22.4|11.1|6.0|0.8|0.2|1.4|0.471|0.369|0.816| |Khris Middleton|F|E|MIL|20|21.2|6.4|6.0|1.1|0.2|2.7|0.517|0.458|0.922| |\**Domantas Sabonis**|F|E|IND|20|20.6|12.0|5.7|0.8|0.4|0.9|0.543|0.327|0.696| |Tobias Harris|F|E|PHI|18|20.3|7.0|2.7|0.9|1.0|2.2|0.514|0.464|0.833| |Bam Adebayo|F|E|MIA|18|20.1|9.3|5.3|0.8|0.9|0.1|0.588|0.400|0.860|"
Yes but Grant is scoring really efficient. Those other guys most of the time we‚Äôre lucky to break 50% TS. Jerami is at 58.8%. Grant is a good player and has shown this season he is a good scorer too
Jerami Grant and Christian Wood are better picks
Jerami Grant has that locked up

Jerami Grant is litterally on the worst record Pistons where as Siakam was on the 2nd best team in the regular season. Pretty shitty comparison fam
"Apparently we need to get Bradley Beal and Jerami Grant to have a chance. /s  Lol idk what's up with some of these dudes but if we have Klay back and the potential Twolves pick plus a developed Wiseman, that's a contender to me. That's all you can ask for"
If there are any Pistons fans out there I vote Jerami Grant for the all star game every day. I hope he makes it
Jerami Grant can't win with these cats.
Jerami Grant just played 8 minutes without recording a box score statistic  Ok then
"Partly yes. But Bron also gets away with charges really, really often at the same time because of his size and strength and athleticism in part. Like last year in the WCF it felt like every time it was a bang-bang play where Jerami Grant got to a spot and was stationary, it would be called a block. I dont think Bron had a single charge called on him. Now mostly I do agree though, Bron doesnt get a lot of calls he probably should but he does benefit from the whistle too at the same time. He's just VERY hard to officiate properly which gets compounded by his whining and reputation I think."
"&gt; I don‚Äôt think it makes sense at all to **blow up this team**/make trades for pop with the false sense of hope to compete when everyone in the organization knows it won‚Äôt lead to anything except a longer rebuild. &gt;  &gt; I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs weird about us rebuilding, and not opting to **blow up our team** for a first round exit    lol... come on, literally I suggested trading 1 guy. Vassell. Y'all have some bizarre separation anxiety. You have a big strength of young wings with upside. Typically teams trade from strength to fill in areas of need, especially smaller-market teams.   If you're all banking on signing Collins, like I said I'd prefer he go to y'all over pretty much anywhere else. But unless it's a Jerami Grant situation where he really wants out, I don't see us not matching. We have a logjam at the wing, like y'all. We have Huerter, Cam, Hunter, and Bogdan - all are pretty much deserving of being starters. We only have Gallo and JC at the 4. I don't think we'll just be letting him go, again unless he just wants out."
"Jaylen Brown definitely got some new tricks. Jerami Grant ring a bell for you? Wiggins got a huge boost in consistency. Zach Lavine seems levelled up. there's tons of guys that are bringing new or drastically improved skills, in spite of the lack of any off-season to speak of"
"Bruh can we wait till it's near the all-star selection date for dumb stuff like this? Like you said, the Heat's record is not reflective of how good they actually are, they're in a slump mired by covid restrictions, minor injuries, and some cold play. Let them ride to the trade deadline, and let's see how records look then.  That being said, I don't think you can just write off certain players because their team is underperforming. For instance, Bam Adebayo's an elite player, putting up a solid 20/9/5. Based on just those numbers, he should be in the all star discussion. I'd even argue that outside of the box score, Adebayo gives more to the Heat than guys like Julius Randle(who's having a career season for the Knicks) or Nikola Vucevic(who's got a single all-star selection, while playing at that level for the last 3-4 seasons now). You also need to take into account their position, like Bam Adebayo wouldn't take the spot of someone like Malcom Brogdan or Collin Sexton, outside of wildcards/reserves.  You give different arguments such as ""not enough games"" or just not playing ""nice enough,"" but you can't seem to give the Heat players the same excuses. What's the opposite of homerism? I'd say whatever that is, that's how you feel about the Heat players. Sure, they're not doing great, I'd for sure place guys like Sabonis, Christian Wood, or heck I'd even give Jerami Grant the spot over Jimmy Butler this season, but come on man. Cut them some slack. You and I both know 20 games isn't enough to judge a team's performances, regardless of how good one team or another has been. Do you REALLY think that the Hornets are a near .500 squad, with their current record of 10 wins and 11 losses, or do you think it has been a spell of weaker schedule, hot shooting, good synergist play, and overall luck? Do you REALLY think that Luka Doncic is going to average 29.4% from 3 for the season and miss the playoffs this season as the current 13th seed?"
Pistons fans get to watch Jerami Grant and all of a sudden forget how to act üòÇ imagine if y‚Äôall had an actual star or competitive coach/FO. Fuck outta here
"The Lakers got better over the shortened offseason by adding Schroder, Montrez and Gasol while the Nuggets lost Jerami Grant. If they do face off in the WCF again then it will be Lakers in 6."
"Only one really is Jerami Grant. Maaaybe Brogdon? He averaged like 17 last year, I don't really think he's that surprising.  That's it though."
"I thought he would become what Jerami Grant is now. An athletic, versatile player who could play both forward positions and be a versatile defender and stroke it from 3."
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"It's possible that Embiid will be the only first round pick from the draft to make an All-Star team.   Good second round though: Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jerami Grant, Nikola Jokic, Dwight Powell (who was pretty good before his Achilles injury), Jordan Clarkson."
"players leave for all sorts of reasons, it's not always about the championship window. Just this past summer Jerami Grant left Denver to go to Detroit because he wanted a different role and to play in a more diverse city.  To say there is no chance of a player leaving in this era is na√Øve imo"
But they‚Äôre not game wreckers. Tobias Harris and Jerami Grant aren‚Äôt dominating teams in the playoffs.  You put Drummond on the Nets or Clippers and he will ruin teams on the inside.
"Well, IMO the Nuggets are feeling the Jerami Grant loss, and if Murray was closer to Bubble Murray then maybe.  Nets are definitely in must win now mode. Anything less than a chip is a fail for them.  I think the Sixers and Jazz have scenarios out there that don‚Äôt end up in a chip that they can walk away feeling good about. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre not true championship or bust to me."
"Beasley can be in the list but he isn't the winner. i think everyone knew he could score pretty efficiently, it was more a matter of usage rate. he didn't get on the court enough with the nuggets and he was hurt  other times. grant always looked good against my team, but I thought he was like gorgui dieng, a role player that turns into a star whenever I see him. lol Jerami has to be tied with wood as the leaders. that said wood was a beast any time he played at all going back to the pelicans so even he is less surprising to me than Jerami grant honestly."
"I don't think team record should be taken into account (as a Jerami Grant stan, lol)."
"Wolves just don‚Äôt have a lot of eyes on them. Plus there‚Äôs already a crowded field of candidates like Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, SGA, and Jerami Grant taking up most of the mip discussion"
"Jerami Grant saw Siakam getting to be a focal point and said ""I can do that"""
Vanderbilt kind of operates (especially on D) like how Jerami Grant looked for us a few years ago. I definitely think he could play next to KAT
I remember back in 2K17 I fucked up and let Russ walk by accident but then Jerami Grant turned into KD 2.0 for me lol.
"Nah, he's no Jerami Grant."
"Hey give your team some credit, Jerami Grant is pretty nice this year"
Jerami Grant or Siakam  Who you taking?
"Of all the Syracuse guys to be drafted in the last decade, I didn't foresee Jerami Grant becoming the best player - no disrespect to Dion Waiters"
"Can't wait for everyone to us him as an example when hyping up their teams young player with terrible shooting splits lol.   ""hE cOuLd DeVeLoP iNtO a JeRaMi GrAnT tPye PlAyEr"" is going to become a mantra"
If Christian Wood gets a thread everytime he scores 20 points we can hear about Jerami Grant occasionally lol
Jerami Grant and Christian Wood. Not ashamed to admit that I thought the highlight of Christian Wood's career would be backing up Jahlil Okafor as they were punching out drunkards outside a Boston nightclub.
I loved Jerami grant on okc but happy to see him strive elsewhere
WouLD YoU rAThEr HavE dAmE or JeRamI GRanT??
&gt;**Jerami** Grant  FTFY
"I'm tired of hearing about Jerami Grant. YES. WE GET IT.  He is scoring so much more and taking so many more shots because the offense is literally geared to run through him. Doesn't mean shit. Detroit is still the second worst team in the league, only being better than the Wolves. We fucking get it lmao don't need a new post about ""hey Jerami Grant is doing more on offense with a hundred more touches on a bad team"" every week."
"I‚Äôll post this in any Jerami grant thread. Jerami and his brother jerian both couldn‚Äôt shoot coming into the nba. Jerian, a 6‚Äô3‚Äù point guard, still can‚Äôt shoot and is on the fringes of the league and might not even be on a roster right now. Meanwhile, Jerami the 6‚Äô8‚Äù slashing defensive lanky wing has somehow turned himself into a plus shooter. It‚Äôs just the opposite of how you would‚Äôve expected that to happen"
Jerami Grant is pretty good. He should come to the Lakers.
"Jerami Grant has such great potential, and is well on his way to achieving it. Dude is a great, long, active defender. Now with more consistent shooting, he‚Äôs really turning into the prototypical 3 &amp; D player that everyone wants so badly."

"Not really, for example Jerami Grant has no chance of being an all-star this year. It will also help balance the league moving forward as the draft will have more teams so incoming talent will be spread thinner."
"well if there were more slots then no, but the rosters would be so large for a game where everyone gets minutes... and there would be more stats to go around for the Jerami Grant 3rd options in bigger roles"
"This is excellent. He'll re-find his love for the game. His confidence is rotting watching younger players usurp his minutes with less talent. He knows it's about the work now. He's learned professional lessons. He took it too personally when Luka stole his team away as a doughy white guy. Then got boo'd by new york's own fans on home court after the trade. He's gonna be back - look at Trey Burke, Chris Boucher, Norm Powell, Van Vleet, Keldon Johnson, Christian Wood. Jerami Grant. at least 40% of the NBA is situation &amp; time."
"He‚Äôs only 20, has only played basketball for like seven years, and is behind Blake Griffin and Jerami Grant for minutes at the 4. I‚Äôm not starting to worry unless he‚Äôs looking bad or not earning minutes after Blake is gone."
Lmaoooo why does no one even mention Jerami Grant as an all star candidate
this mf jerami grant has gotten SO good
"Jerami Grant last season averaged 12ppg off the bench for the Nuggets, he shot 38% from 3 on 3.5 attempts a game  Jerami Grant this season is averaging 24ppg, and shooting 40% from 3 currently on almost double the volume. Dude has become a legit 1st option out of nowhere  Christian Wood went from 13ppg to a 23/10 double-double machine.  Keldon Johnson is great, but he's only gone from 9ppg to 14ppg. I don't see how he has a strong case for MIP over Grant or Wood."
2nd year players do not really win MIP. And compared to people leading the race like Jerami Grant and Christian Wood his case isn‚Äôt as strong.
Julius Randle   Christian Wood   Jerami Grant
Is Defense the problem in Denver? They let go of Jerami Grant and Torrey Craig so I figure their defense has been weak?
"In the past year the owner has stepped back from meddling and actually allowed the new GM (Troy Weaver who was an assistant GM with the Thunder) do an actual full rebuild. The Gores meddling is part of the reason the team had been so bad. He had a playoffs or bust mentality and forced a lot of the bad moves the team made without taking the blame.   Gores told Dumars he had to get stars when he first arrived which led to us signing Josh Smith (because realistically what legit star is coming to Detroit in free agency) and forced the Brandon Knight Kris Middleton for Brandon Jennings trade (Dumars was very high on Middleton and thought he had the chance to be good but playoffs and win now takes precedent right). After he fired Dumars instead of hiring a coach and GM that might develop a young core (Drummond, Dinwiddie, and KCP all looked promising at the time) he hired Stan Van Gundie to be the Coach/GM and told him we where a win now team.   Obviously a lot of stuff happened over the Van Gundy years but I think the most obvious ways Gores win now directive hurt us where the Stanley Johnson pick, Blake Griffin trade, and Luke Kennard pick. Long story short Johnson was picked over better players because he played NBA level defense and was considered the best option to help the team immediately (tbf he looked decent in that playoff series his 1st year). Kennard was picked over Donovan Mitchell because Kennard shot well and would help the team immediately. Where as Mitchell was seen by the franchise as someone that would take sometime to develop. While Blake Griffin was traded for because Gores told Van Gundy playoffs or bust and he was trying to save his job. Gores meddling has hurt the team for years and was a major reason we couldn't rebuild.  Recently though Gores has stepped back and has allowed to Troy Weaver to start a full rebuild which is refreshing to see. Also Weaver got Sadiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart in his 1st draft who both look to be good. Hayes looks bad right now but he was supposed to be project so I'm not worried yet. Last year the Pistons got Doumbouya who has potential. Also n free agency Weaver signed Josh Jackson who was showing flashes of a breakout with us before his injury. As well as Jerami Grant who is showing that he can be a legitimately great player. This is honestly the most excited I've been about the Pistons in years.  Also the Pistons are managing to tank while being super competitive in the games they've played. They had 3 bad losses to Milwaukee but other than that everyone game has come down to the wire. I know Pistons fans keep saying this but they're not nearly as bad as their record indicates and looking at net ratings shows that [bbref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_ratings.html). They're 17th in the leauge in adjusted Net Rating and they're 22nd if you use [NBA.com's](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1) unadjusted Net rating. Basically we get to watch competitive basketball while the team is tanking and I'm really happy about that. I also like the moves Weaver has made and think he is a good GM. So I'm happy about the future."
They'll get votes but I think at the moment it's between Christian Wood and Jerami Grant.
"Kyrie over Trae. Also, it probably won‚Äôt happen, but Jerami Grant is balling this year"
I mean look at Jerami Grant now. He was sitting behind Melo...
I was pulling my hair out because Melo was not playing that great and we've got Jerami Grant sitting on the bench behind him.
"Jerami grant has been playing at an allstar level, the resulta have just not been there for them"
"&gt; Barnes, Otto Porter, OG, Jerami Grant, Jaylen - to name a quick few that are of similar quality to Hunter.   &gt;Jaylen Brown, who just made the jump out of the role player group  &gt;Hunter is a very good player, but he's ultimately a role player  So which is it?"
I'm throwing Jerami Grant all-star forward votes this year.  Already know Giannis/KD/Embiid going to be a lock so voting for him and Sabonis.
"Yeah, I'm thinking of another trade, but a trade that helps the Magic. I was thinking Gordon and Bamba for Jerami Grant."
If you still think Jerami Grant is mediocre you simply haven‚Äôt been watching

Lebron James got locked up Jerami Grant. MJ runs laps around Lebron. Easy blowout for MJ
"MJ wouldn‚Äôt even score 20 points against this team, players are stronger and faster now and he can‚Äôt dominate anyone and would just get locked down by Jerami Grant."
Jerami Grant boomed em
Jerami Grant should at least get a mention here
We can‚Äôt let him and Jerami Grant play at the same time or else we‚Äôd be #1 in the east and our tank mission will have failed
"I know he‚Äôs on the pistons, but can we just mention Jerami Grant getting 25 a game?"
When you think about arguing why Jerami Grant deserves to make it just think about how Bradley real deal Beal got snubbed last year. There is zero chance Grant makes it. Or are you saying honorable mention?
How about Jerami Grant?
Can't he just play a game of 21 with Jerami Grant?
"The disrespect of not including Jerami Grant... 24.4 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 1.2 BPG."
"I mean disregarding the fact that we‚Äôve only won 4 games, if anyone is ‚Äúcarrying‚Äù us it‚Äôs Jerami Grant."
"Tbh I don't see the point of voting in locks like LeBron, Giannis, Steph etc since they are assured spots whether I vote for them or not.

Jerami Grant has been a pleasant surprise for them.
Yeah when he carried the team and had such super stars around him like;  - Not good yet Oladipo  - Bad defense Enes Kanter   - Jerami Grant before this year   - Steven Adams who was actually pretty good.   - Ersan Ilyasova before he went to the Bucks for the 237th time.   Yeah those teams were totally loaded with talent feeding him stats.
i can balance it out for ya.  jerami grant will win MVP after leading the pistons to 58-14 averaging 36/6/11/3/3 and 60/50/101

As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
I'm here for soon to be NBA God Jerami Grant
Is Jerami Grant the sole remaining NBA player who wears that stupid tape?
"Horace Grant and his brother, Harvey Grant, played in the NBA. Harvey Grant is the father of Jerami and Jerian Grant."
"&gt;Bogdan Bogdanovic: 4 years, $72M  Was certainly an overpay for Bogdanovic but the Hakws had money to spend.  &gt;Malik Beasley: 4 years, $60M  Malik isn't limited as a player like Duncan is and is actually really athletic and could improve as a defender whereas Duncan's main problem on defence is that he is slow and anyone can blow by him.  Also Malik's 4th year is a TO so he got like 45/3 (and it's an ascending contract so its worth more in the subsequent years so its more in like 42/3). &gt;Jerami Grant: 3 years, $60M (before he turned into current Jerami Grant and was averaging 12/3.5/1.2)  Certainly an overpay for a guy who made his money as a defensive stopper but he has surprisingly lived up to his contract  &gt;Joe Harris: 4 years, $75M  Again Joe Harris actually has an offensive game outside of shooting 3's and is a better defender and rebounder so I'd say he is actually worth his contract meanwhile with Duncan you need to surround him with strong defenders not to bleed points."
"So why wouldn't a different shit team in need of a shooter throw the bag at him and force Miami to make the tough decision?  Other contracts from last offseason:  * Danilo Galinari: 3 years, $61.5M * Bogdan Bogdanovic: 4 years, $72M * Malik Beasley: 4 years, $60M * Jerami Grant: 3 years, $60M (before he turned into current Jerami Grant and was averaging 12/3.5/1.2) * Joe Harris: 4 years, $75M  $20M/yr might be a little high but every offseason seems full of ""wow I wasn't expecting THAT much"" contracts. I think the Joe Harris 4 years $75M is probably about right, maybe slightly more. 4 years $80M wouldn't be a complete shock."
"Disagree. Top 25 refers to who, in this moment, is playing the best in the league. You don‚Äôt seem as stupid as the other guy, but just to clarify, I didn‚Äôt say KAT was top 25. He‚Äôs played 4 games and he hasn‚Äôt been particularly impactful. There are other guys who are balling rn (Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, and Collin Sexton to name a few) and deserve to be top 25 right now."
Yes and no.  Teams will always take advantage of a buyout market but players can only get bought out if their team agrees to it. It's not something you invest in as an alternative to trades.   What we're seeing right now is really just the aftermath of a salary cap increase from a few years ago where players were getting contracts they didn't deserve and (surprise) turned out to not be worth it.   What's most likely going to happen now is that teams will be more hesitant to offer such lucrative deals to players after seeing how hard salary karma can hit.... Unless you're detroit and you give Jerami Grant the bag to play kobe until they figure out what the hell they're doing... But hey someone's gotta drive the tank I guess
"Jerami Grant, Tobias Harris, Bradley Beal"
Cough up your Jerami Grant then bud you just said we needed him why you gotta be so selfish like damn. But more seriously I think a Josh Jackson type of player to round out the wing spot in an 8 man rotation would go a long way so what would you want back for him?
"No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs not 2021 Christian Wood, Jerami Grant and RoCo... it‚Äôs 5 years ago. I watched a bunch of the games and they were all raw... they had potential but they certainly weren‚Äôt competent players in 2016"
"that's a good point, the ones good enough to get maxed will be matched, the ones that are not you will need to gamble on. Risky but you could end up with Jerami Grant like production from a guy like Horton Tucker down the line"
&gt; Jerami Grant + Rodney Mcgruder or other filler for Drummond + filler.   cmon
&gt; Jerami Grant + Rodney Mcgruder or other filler for Drummond + filler.  are you smoking crack j/w
"Does Jerami Grant even want to go to Boston? There was a quote saying that he wanted to play for a black coach, in a black city, where he had an expanded offensive role for growth.  If he wanted the same role he had in Denver, he would have just stayed with the Nuggets."
"Looks like it‚Äôs either Otto Porter for Drummond plus a 2nd or something or Jerami Grant + Rodney Mcgruder or other filler for Drummond + filler.  Idk if Jerami Grant is going anywhere but other than Blake Griffin there‚Äôs no way to get the salaries to match. I would like to see Grant in a Cavs jersey, really fits this team well. Especially if we are... trading Cedi üò¢üò¢"
"you say bench forwards, but we are fucking playing two bigs most of the time, or starting Semi Ojeleye or Javonte Green, OR BOTH.  But yeah, Jerami Grant doesn't seem like a guy who wants to be 3rd-4th scoring option."
"https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/  Touches and opportunity were a part of it, but he wanted to be with an organization and a city where he could have a greater influence on black issues. That is in large part due to there being a black GM and black coach in a city that is majority black."
"No he‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs actually a thing: https://www.google.com/amp/s/theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/%3Famp"
"No, thinking Jerami Grant is a realistic option with any of the assets Boston has on the table is what I was referring to."
We don‚Äôt mention him anymore. We‚Äôre past that! Jerami Grant for MVP
Jerami Grant reportedly signed with the Pistons partly because he wanted to play for an organization with a black coach and a black GM
"That's a fine conversation, but no one comes close to Jerami Grant."
So you say he went to Detroit to make money even though Denver matched the offer. But Jerami Grant himself says he went to Detroit to play for an African American coach and gm. Wonder who I should believe?
"Jerami grant did not look this promising as a rookie, believe me. Give pritchard time, he will develop well, even as good as grant (i hope at least)"
"Pritchard looks solid for a rookie, but ""pretty damn good"" is a stretch. He's not even close to as promising as Jerami Grant."
Do you seriously think Jerami Grant isn‚Äôt getting traded at the deadline?
Wait a second I though Jerami Grant has a horrible contract from a clearly insane GM and he's not even that good? Why would any team want to take that on?
"&gt;**Celtics** &gt; &gt;&gt; Among top trade targets for the Celtics: Detroit‚Äôs Jerami Grant, sources said.  How many draft picks are they going to say they were willing to trade when this deal doesn't happen? In what world does it make sense for Detroit to trade Grant for anything the Celtics would be willing to offer?"
"You‚Äôre right, in a world where the Nets got James Harden by giving all of their picks, it‚Äôs impossible for the Celtics to land Jerami Grant using theirs."
I mean some already said pp as trade piece for Jerami Grant is a no
"Vooch not that much.  Jerami Grant on the other hand, it‚Äôs exactly what we need."
they're already getting top lottery odds so why would they trade their best player? didn't jerami grant just leave denver so he could avoid being the 4th option?
Have fun begging the Pistons to take Romeo Langford and two firsts for Jerami Grant lmao
I truly never got the hate. He is young and looked super promising his last season in Boston. Same deal happened with Jerami Grant.
"RoCo, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, TJ and Christian Wood were all on our 10-72 roster. Also Nerlens and Jah but we don't talk about them"
yeah I think wood took a pay cut to play with houston but Im pretty sure our beat reporter said our FO didnt offer him Jerami Grant money (20M/year) so we definitely tried to short him lol
"I sincerely hope not. Fade 4 Cade! Hahaha  However, I believe we had the 3rd hardest schedule in the league the first half of the season (and competitive in most) and the 2nd half we have one of the easier ones.  Our draft picks are all panning out, plum dog and Jerami Grant having career years.  Not likely, but perhaps possible."
"Pistons didn‚Äôt have Jerami Grant either. Raptors got absolutely destroyed by a Pistons team without two of their top 4 players. That isn‚Äôt just Casey, it‚Äôs also the Raptors playing completely terribly."
"You can say that and it's fair but last year the Nuggets had some similar issues. Paul Millsap and MPJ were all but unplayable defensively in that series - JaMychal Green is much more mobile than Millsap and should be able to stay out there when Bojan is out there. MPJ's defense is night day different this year, he's not good there yet but he's much, much better defensively and improving by the game while also actually being integrated into the offense as a weapon (if he's fully integrated, there's no one on the Jazz that can guard him either). By the same token with the Conley thing, Gary Harris didnt come back in the playoffs until game 6. He missed the first 5 and his defensive presence was felt quite strongly by Mitchell and Conley both in games 6 and 7. No guarantee he plays if they match up a gain, but I think that's part of why Denver's held him out so long, they want to make sure Gary is healthy for the playoffs. Jamal Murray is also vastly improved on the defensive end too. PJ Dozier is better at dealing with guards than Jerami Grant was since... y'know, that's his actual position. Will Barton didnt play last year in the playoffs at all. He gets a lot of ire from Nuggets fans (including myself at times), but he's a good 2-way player when healthy and locked in. He defends decently/with good effort and length (and there's not really anyone on the Jazz save Bojan who can punish his slight build), and he can get to the rim and shoot. Both are different teams, and the Nuggets are a different team arguably moreso than the Jazz, they've just had some quite bad luck with injuries and a couple covid related absences.   I still maintain that despite all the differences in both teams, it will come down to if the Jazz can stop Murray and Jokic, and... I just dont think they can. We have a pretty clear trend now in the last what, 12 games they've played including the playoffs, Jokic dominates Gobert at this point, and Murray can get to whatever spot he wants (in this way too, Murray is harder to scheme against than Mitchell - both great players no doubt, and Mitchell is especially good if you let him get to the rim, but he's not quite as good of an outside or midrange shooter - and Murray's best skill is his ability to make difficult shots along with that 3 level ability... you can take 1 or even 2 areas away but it's extremely difficult to take away everything. Even Kawhi/PG/Pat Bev couldnt do it)"
Jerami Grant somewhere on there
"Considering the players the Nuggets have are (mostly) high upside guys that haven't shown much, they probably won't get the value they could get in a year.  As a Nuggets fan, I wrote off this year as a development year the moment Jerami Grant left. I think the Nuggets will be better in 2021-2022 than they would have if he stayed.  The Nuggets just need one or two of MPJ, Nanji, Bol, and RJ to hit.  And it is starting to look very positive with everyone but Bol."
"Yup, it‚Äôs why Denver has a long list of players leaving for more minutes/bigger roles.   Jusuf Nurkic Evan Fournier Trey Lyles Malik Beasley Jerami Grant Mason Plumlee  Will Barton will definitely be next."
Jerami Grant actually fits all of these categories. It's frustrating as a Pistons fan the amount of people who say he's only putting up numbers because his team sucks
Jerami Grant
Jerami Grant
"&gt;Just goes to show averaging 18 a game wasnt that hard back then either. Even a career 9 PPG role player managed it.  McCloud was 30th in the league that season in points-per-game.  Only 20 players managed 20+.  So far this season 38 are averaging 20+, and McCloud would be 41st.  So yeah, it precisely was much harder then.  And right now, we have Jerami Grant -- a career role player with a 10 ppg average -- putting up 23.4 per game.  &gt; Seriously, people who think players today would average 15 points less ‚Äúback in the day‚Äù are so out of touch with reality it‚Äôs genuinely sad.   You should learn one or two things before attempting to call anyone else's knowledge ""sad"".  &gt;It‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt appreciate how ridiculously good today‚Äôs players are because you‚Äôre stuck back in time.   No, they are simply not very good.  Half of the rulebook is ignored just to hide the fact that the quality of play has dropped so drastically."
"We lost jerami grant and torrey Craig mpj has been a disappointement and looks to be only good as scorer without any basketball iq,gary harris offensive decline has been a lot steeper than expected jamal murray has returned to his inconsistent self and will barton has forgotten how to play basketball"
"I think we originally intended to compete this year, not tank.  Vincent Goodwill reported that we were in on the FVV discussions but just got priced out. This occurred AFTER we signed Grant.  So imagine Blake is back to playing like he did in 2019 (third team all NBA), Rose is playing like he did last year, and then we add in Jerami Grant, FVV, Plumlee and Delon Wright.  Is that a world beater? Of course not. But that team probably competes for the 6th spot in the East.  Griffin, Rose and Hayes being as bad as they were was a surprise and now we're mostly trying to tank (as much as Casey likes playing vets 35 mpg).  It explains why we went through the different machinations to stretch guys instead of just biting the bullet."
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d‚Äôanglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
"It always seemed like an exaggeration as a terrible contract, but this sub just didn't give MJ the benefit of the doubt.   Lots of moderate contracts like this can be a great deal if the player expands their game a moderate amount. Similar to jerami grant, julius randle who are also on ~20m/year deals"
So what your saying is they should of picked jerami grant /s
"I mean, I‚Äôm not really gonna give the Sixers credit for Christian Wood or even really Jerami Grant tbh"
"They were trying to lose last year. Wiggins isn‚Äôt amazing but he is by all accounts a plus defender and is pretty efficient this year, ditto Oubre. No one is saying that GSW has a ton of talent, but to say they are the worst team in the league when Detroit‚Äôs two best players are probably Jerami Grant and Josh Jackson/Plumlee is pretty laughable."
"they need a Jerami Grant replacement though, they don't need another scorer."
"It was Torrey Craig, don't slander my guy Jerami Grant like that."
Jerami Grant would be so good on the Nuggies
"Let‚Äôs be honest. Jokic is a transcendental talent offensively, but pretty much limits their defense to a style of playing up on pick and roll and rotating a shit ton. If their guards get beaten off the dribble, he‚Äôs not the best at helping. I want to believe Jokic can win a championship but that would be frustrating as an offensive guard from a defensive perspective. Let me be clear, Jokic is one of my favorite players in the league but this is concerning. That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt just lose a player like Jerami Grant"
If the Pels traded Brandon Ingram for Jerami Grant I would actually kill myself
Even Jerami Grant would hit you for asking this.
Jerami Grant is better than DLo
Jerami Grant would go scorched earth
PISStons win in 6 Jerami Grant FINALS MVP
"If it was about statistics purely, guys like Jerami Grant and De‚ÄôAaron Fox would get in over guys like Ben Simmons and Chris Paul, so not, it isn‚Äôt just stats based."
I like Jerami Grant. Think it's cool he chose to go to Detroit and try and build something there.

Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
Jerami Grant and De‚ÄôAaron Fox..
"DeAaron Fox and Jerami Grant, who would have been reasonable selections anyway, tbh. Not spectacular, but justifiable."
"The lottery ended up being pretty booty, but aside from all stars in Embiid (3), Randle (7), LaVine (13), and Jokic (41), the draft also had numerous starters or major role players: Aaron Gordon (4), Marcus Smart (6), Elfrid Payton (10), TJ Warren (14), Nurkic (16), Garry Harris (19), Capella (25), Bogdan^2 (27), Kyle Anderson (30), Joe Harris (33), Dinwiddie (38), Jerami Grant (39!), Dwight Powell (45), Clarkson (46!), and the legendary Thanasis Antetokounmpo (51)."
I didn‚Äôt realize players took note to this - until Jerami Grant came to Detroit because Detroit was a black city w a Black Coach and GM
True. And Jerami Grant is gone and better than we all realized.
"Thanks, now I can update my list of All-Star snubs!

Not to mention we got Jerami Grant as a byproduct of that trade as well. Not to hate on Serge but literally anyone of those players would of benefitted ther team more in the long run. Let alone all three.
"Victor Oladipo, the 8th pick(Sabonis) and Ersan(later traded for Jerami Grant) for Serge Ibaka was worse."
Jerami Grant
He has attempted roughly the same amount of 3s as Jerami Grant and has made less. You can justify it however you like it but that's average.
Wasn‚Äôt Jerami Grant on that Portland team? And Mo Harkless and Aminu.  Where did everyone go?
"I agree. But the fan votes and the media votes doesn't notice that. People with a great fan base and a good statline of 20, 5 and 5, will become a legit all-star. Both Zion and Jerami are averaging similar numbers, but of course, Zion gets all the fan votes and the media votes. I'm not saying that he doesn't deserve this one. Props to him for becoming an all-star, but Pelicans do have some scoring options, besides Zion, which is not the case of Booker or Jerami Grant."
 Jerami Grant no love
Sucks. It‚Äôs a lot of players balling right now. Jerami Grant averaging similar numbers and basically wasn‚Äôt concerned because we fucking suck
Jerami Grant
"Knew it was a long shot, but really wished Jerami Grant got some love."
Yes but at a certain point some opinions just aren‚Äôt very valid.  I was too harsh on dame booker sure to make a point here.  However saying Kawhi is a better player than say Jerami grant is literally not up for debate at all
I'm sure you just forgot Jerami Grant
"Id go Capela over Warren. Warren had a decent run for a bit last year and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôd go Aaron Gordon, Jerami Grant, Jordan Clarkson and would debate Joe &amp; Gary Harris over Warren too from that draft class."
Imagine thinking Jerami Grant is anywhere near as good as Sabonis
Poor jerami grant
Beal making it is the equivalent of SGA or Jerami Grant making it
Exactly as many comments as I was expecting for a Pistons/Magic thread an hour into the game. Two.   Obligatory Jerami Grant is the most underrated player in the league two years running and he is somehow outperforming the contract that everyone thought was an overpay.
JERAMI GRANT ROBBED
"This seems...really good? Booker, Sabonis, Brogdon, and Jerami Grant are the only ones I think could've made it that didn't but can't get too mad at the people that did. Great job NBA"
Would you trade CJ for Jerami Grant?
Trading Cj for a Jerami Grant type seems like a good move
lmfao the jerami grant one might be one of the dumbest things i‚Äôve ever read ngl   you have to know how bad that trade is
He still impacts winning more than guys like Jerami Grant and Bradley Beal.
"Small market usually implies that it doesn‚Äôt attract free agents and doesn‚Äôt have as much spending money, Detroit might‚Äôve been a big market back in the day but for the past decade our‚Äùbig‚Äù moves have been signing Josh smith to an ungodly deal, taking on Blake‚Äôs ungodly deal and giving jerami grant a (decent) deal. We are small market as hell."
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I‚Äôd have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
I want Jerami Grant to make it but there's just no room for him
Kyle Lowry  Joe Harris  OG Anunoby  Jerami Grant  Rudy Gobert
"The 2 wild card spots have a plethora of guys it could go to. Trae and Lavine I feel like will get the most consideration but after that em there‚Äôs:  Randle, Siakam, Bam, Vucevic, Butler, Hayward, and Jerami Grant all of which have a case you can make.  East is much more stacked with talent than it‚Äôs been in years past..  Honestly I feel like you could switch Sabonis and Bam as far as your locks go, but both should be in, especially Domas"
Manifesting Saddiq Bey Finals MVP  Cade Saddiq Jerami Grant big 3?
"The sheer power of Jokic gives 2014 a good case as the best one also  NIkola Jokic, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson, Glenn Robinson III. Looking at it more yeah it is better than 2012  Issue with 2nd round picks is even the guys who end up good often take years to do so and the team who drafts them doesnt think they are good and ends up dumping them. Crowder, Barton, Dinwiddie, Harris, Grant, none of these are guys who did it on the team that drafted them really."
"I would disagree. We were deep because Schr√∂der and Nerlens, who were on the team with Russ and PG, got major boosts from playing with Chris.      Also the Russ/PG team had Jerami Grant who left, and is always conveniently forgotten when people bring up the ""differences in depth"" between the two years"
"is PG, jerami grant, adams bad defenders?"
"The Pistons are one of the worst offensive teams in the NBA - so I'd say a F.  The team's only pure shooters are Wayne Ellington (a vet who needs other to get him shots) Saddiq Bey (a rookie who is still inconsistent) &amp; Frank Jackson (a 2-way player who is shooting well form 3 for the first time in his career).  On top of that, the only offensive creators on the team are Jerami Grant (who is not yet a good passer), Hamidou Diallo (who only recently arrived in Detroit) and Josh Jackson (who is very inefficient).   On a bright side - the Pistons actually have a solid defensive team."
Jerami Grant bruh. I‚Äôd get to just chuck up shots all game surrounded by hard working defensive guys. Perfect situation to develop into a star
How do you lose to the Pistons by double digits without Jerami Grant playing?
genuinely pissed off at the Kings here. how fucking bad can you be to get dominated by a Pistons team without Jerami Grant? Not to mention you let cojo drop a 24/7/4 line on you. Actually pathetic by Walton. Man should not be an NBA coach.
It could stand to reason though that having attention taken away from you by Steph Curry/Jerami Grant could result in a fairly different outcome statistically than Damion Lee/Josh Jackson
That‚Äôs why Jerami Grant went to Detroit
and jerami grant is out for pistons tonight too..idk about blazers tho
"Play out his contract?  The fucking Pistons doesnt want him to play out his contract. He is owed nearly 40m next year. For a tanking team like the Piston, they would rather have that cap space to sign someone like they did with Jerami Grant or at the very least trade for a bad contract and draft pick instead of paying that to Blake. Or you would rather the Piston to suck it up and be bad for another extra year instead of fasten their rebuild?   Ain't nobody gonna trade for him either, so either he get bought out or he get paid ~75m while hampering the Piston rebuild.   How about team stop fucking lying to their players about being the face of the team and shit and then proceed to fucking trade them? Or did you think Blake wanted to be in Detroit rather than in LA?  If team can lie to their players with a straight face like that and get rewarded then why can't player do what's best for them?"
the anti-jerami grant
He's also in a posistion to be the main player on a tanking team that is getting destroyed every game. Call it the Jerami Grant effect.
"I‚Äôd say Jerami Grant. Randle improved his 3P% from 28% to 41% which is amazing, he improved his FG% from 46% to 46.4% and from 20 ppg to 23 ppg.   Jerami Grant went from 12 ppg to 23 ppg. On less efficiency but surpassing 20 ppg after going 6 years never going above less than 14 points is pretty amazing"
"The nephews were in denial when the trade happened, ""oh they're washed"". Like bruh blake went from playing with jerami grant to kd kyrie and Durant"
Lmfao Jerami Grant has 33 dunks in 48 games for the Pistons this season alone.   If Blake couldn‚Äôt get dunks why could all of his teammates???? Christian Wood had 115 last year. Drummond had 81. Blake had 5 over two seasons.   It‚Äôs delusional to honestly think he was trying in Detroit. He gave up. It‚Äôs pitiful.
"You aren‚Äôt familiar with the elite tier spacing that Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Josh Jackson, Delon Wright, Killian Hayes, and Jahlil Okafor were providing Blake early this season so that nobody was clogging the lane defensively?"
"I think it would be closer than people realize, when he wants to score he is completely unstoppable in the paint. I remember him easily backing down prime DeAndre Jordan when he was like 21, and last night he was throwing around Jerami Grant like a ragdoll. He‚Äôs a lot stronger than people realize, I mean over the past 4 years Embiid is only shooting 9/29 (30%) against him per NBA tracking, largely because he‚Äôs one of the only guys strong enough that Joel can‚Äôt just push him around like Gobert or something."
"Your commentators, TWICE in the first quarter, said ""Denver chose not to retain jerami grant""... gimme a break. Called MPJ Campazzo. Few other weird things too.  I did like yours for the most part but that's pretty ridiculous"
"Since last year when they beat the Jazz by 1 missed 3 and the Jazz were missing their second leading scorer?  The Nuggets don't have Harris anymore cause they swapped him for Gordon and they had Jerami Grant last year and lost him to free agency for nothing.  Not saying the Nuggets wouldn't beat the Jazz persay, but how can you say they've gotten better than last year when truthfully they look about the same, if not marginally worse?"
"It was a fucking example, read the rest of the post  Other long term examples, Jerami Grant shooting way better as a 3rd option with Jokic/Murray vs now, being a 3rd option with great offensive players means you are more efficient  Also i literally said HE WILL ALWAYS BE A VERY GOOD EFFICIENT PLAYER   Jesus read the entire thing"
"Doesn't matter, he's shooting over 60% from the field because as long as you're a good cutter and do things off ball Jokic will find you  Jerami Grant is a bigger sample size then, for the Nuggets with Jokic 60% TS, without him his career TS% is basically 55%~, Paul Millsap has been way more efficient with Jokic too than he was as a 2nd option in Atlanta"
Jerami Grant would be cool

"Awesome post dude, really like how you addressed the issues with the stat while also making key observations about how to read the data.  Really cool to see that this does absolutely establish how Curry's impact on the Warriors this season.

It's hard to maintain intensity on D as a big offensive option. Jerami Grant said it recently and  Kawhi once said he couldn't be a DPOY level guy after he became an offensive star. So maybe it'll just take time for Brown to adjust
Jerami Grant was laughing
"Jerami grant, plumlee and bey are balling out. But we are unironically too good it feels good to say that haha"
Jerami Grant has very cute anime eyes
"I got a message for not thinking Jerami Grant was much beyond an elite role player. He's better than that but now unfortunately he's below league average efficiency, so I'm still not sure he's really the 1/2 guy on a good team."
"Citing two 50 point games, which were sporadic and only happened in the bubble, is like the ultimate example of a player being inconsistent. If you have to point at one or two massive games to defend a player‚Äôs quality, that player is not consistent. 21ppg this season (less than guys like Collin sexton and Jerami Grant) speaks for itself."
I could see a potential trade for Jerami Grant if the Pistons get unlucky in the lottery and end up with like the 10th pick.
I think the most likely scenario is the Warriors trading a few of their assets (definitely not everything) for a guy like Jerami Grant and another starter like Larry Nance jr. There are very few non-playoff teams with All-Star/fringe All-Star players that aren‚Äôt on their rookie deals.
"Yeah I feel like that tier should be for guys like Jerami Grant and Malcom Brogdon, not Ben Simmons."

I was the same with Jerami and Jerian Grant
Jerami Grant would be able to score at will
"Uhhh, because like Jerami Grant and 4 bums could take out either squad.  Flo Thamba and Vital looked like dikembe mutombo against the Zags, Plumlee would literally be prime shaq"
"Well, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see him turn out like Jerami Grant offensively."
"What does contract negotiations have to do with this?     You think some team out there is gonna be like ""I know he sucked ass for half the season, but man he's really confident in himself, let's max the fuck out of this dude""     Really?      And even if there is a team like that, you can't compare people in normal jobs negotiating salary to a 25 year old NBA player negotiating.      Is Midwest Bob gonna threaten the accounting firm he works at that he'll move to the Southeast if they don't give him what he wants? Hell no. He's got a wife and three kids who depend on him, the oldest is a senior in high school and smart enough to get into University of Michigan, but that tuition is gonna be a bitch to pay.      Honestly Oubre's just probably hurting any contract negotiations he'll have with any team. Look at what Jerami Grant got out of coming to the Nuggets and doing whatever the hell they asked him to do. Dude played off the bench, he played out of position, he got thrown on all the hardest wings to guard in the West and he got 20 mil from the Pistons and a leading role in their offense."
Detroit. Jerami Grant can't command that tank by himself
\#1 options on bad teams get a lot more fame and money generally. See: Jerami Grant
"The original question was very specific, asking if he'd be ok with coming off the bench for the Warriors next season, and he answered it with that vague statement about being able to contribute more starting. In a vacuum I see nothing wrong with that statement, and hey, if he wants to leave the Warriors next year to pursue a starting role, kudos to him. That's not unprecedented and has happened with many other players (Jerami Grant, Rozier, Barnes).   But it's the answer to that specific question about starting on the Warriors that is the main issue here. He's coming off as very stubborn. I get players need to have confidence in their own abilities to make it in this league but there has to be a balance between your ego and your own self-awareness."
"I believe he was talking about specifically for fit within our team.  We don‚Äôt need either of them to create their own shot on-ball - Gordon was doing that in Orlando and it was underwhelming. Grant is doing that for y‚Äôall and he‚Äôs having some success but it‚Äôs not super efficient.  Either way, our team doesn‚Äôt need that. The role gordon is filling - and that grant was kind of doing to a lesser extent last year - is as an athletic finisher on the offensive end who can also hit his spot up shots. And on the defensive end locking down whoever the biggest threat is on the wing.  Grant is a little taller than Gordon, but he‚Äôs not as strong/stout. And he was weirdly a poor rebounder for his size. His defense was OK, but it felt like it was more about his body size than incredible defensive acumen. Offensively, he was a fine shooter, though streaky for us. But the biggest difference between them is the use of their athleticism, specifically on cuts, pnr, and the dunker spot. I remember so many of us being hyped when we got grant because we thought he would do..well basically exactly what Gordon is doing now. Lots of free dunks off of cuts from Jokic because of his athleticism. But jerami just never seemed to do that.  And given just how quickly Gordon has acclimated to our system, I can‚Äôt imagine it was a coaches decision not to use jerami in that way."
"The narrative about him deserving MIP is a joke too.  Nothing about what Jerami Grant is doing this season should be surprising or impressive to anyone that's watched him the last couple years.  He is a decent scorer who can give you above average defense.  He moved from a western conference finals team where he was an efficient 12ppg scorer to the second worst team in the league where he's soring 22ppg on 42% from the field.  He has the worst shooting numbers of anyone &gt;20ppg player outside of Russell Westbrook.  I don't call that improvement, I call that getting more shots."
Jerami Grant this season too
"Probably 4/80 or so, the money we already had reserved for Jerami Grant"
"Wow, no kidding? I guess my eye test was right, because he was making LeBron uncomfortable. Great pickup for the Nuggets. People made a lot of what Jerami Grant did in the playoffs, but I thought his defense was really just okay to good, not elite. Gordon's an upgrade in that regard."
Gordon Hayward Jerami Grant Zach Lavine Vucci Mane are the few i could think of
Jerami Grant
"Exactly, that should be given to guys who have taken leaps and strides in their game. Jerami Grant from role player to borderline all-star; Christian Wood from barely in the league to top C; Julius Randle from a spinning meme to a walking triple double"
Yea I think there are maybe 3-4 guys that could carry this team to a 7/8 seed in the East. That‚Äôs not the point I‚Äôm making. The point is that Grant scoring 22 points per game on below average efficiency is about what everyone expected. I don‚Äôt think we really know that much more about Jerami Grant that we didn‚Äôt know from his time on the Nuggets. Name one team in the East where you swap him with the #2 and that teams championship chances increase?
I'm not a Pistons fan but always root for the Pistons. I've probably watched more Pistons games this year than most people who aren't Pistons fans. I think the future looks bright. At PG rookie Killian Hayes is a question mark but a good PG is not hard to find in this league. At SG Hamidou Diallo seems like an exciting athletic player who is a good defender and explosive scorer. At SF rookie Saddiq Bey seems like a solid defender and very good 3pt shooter. At PF Jerami Grant has been playing great and looks like one of the most improved players in the NBA this year. At C rookie Isaiah Stewart provides a strong defensive presence and has a good ability to score down low
"I think pretty much everyone in the top 5 of the draft order will be able to get a very good player out of it. I unfortunately do not think Detroit will be bad enough to pick early again.   Still, 2/3 first round picks from this past drafts have been pretty damn good (Hayes hasn't had the chance yet, but he did very well in his comeback last night despite scoring no points), lots of young and cheap talent that can stick around or be replaced + our lord and savior Jerami Grant.   Once Griffin is off the books in a few years, I think the real upward trajectory will be enough to attract some big name FAs and start competing for real again."
"I think Jaden can be a pretty good 4. He just needs to get a little bigger like Jerami Grant did. He's 6'10 too his going to be find at the 4. I hope you guys get Cade he would perfect for you guys. A lineup of Cade, Beasley, Ant, McDaniels and Kat is really fun."

Jerami Grant became a prime FA off his contributions. Crowder is also a good pick
Are we finally off the Jerami Grant bandwagon? Dude is exactly who we thought he was going to be on the Pistons. An inefficient number one option putting up better counting stats compared to his time on the Nuggets.
Jerami Grant doesn't take over games because he can't lol. He's not a #1 option kind of guy. He had a hot stretch early on in the year and has now regressed to the mean.
"If I'm picking teams for a game tomorrow: Mann &gt; Claxton &gt; THT. If we are basing this off potential: Claxton &gt; Mann &gt; THT.   I'm biased given the team I root for, but Claxton has the potential to be a really special defender. It's rare for a 20 year old 7 footer to switch onto short and quick guards like Lillard and Wall, as well as combo forwards like Tatum and Jerami Grant, with ease. I can only imagine what he'll be doing in a few years."
Last year's Jerami Grant Denver Nuggets was better
"That‚Äôs the risk you take. If they develop a shot, then you‚Äôve got a scary athletic player that can shoot. See: Richard Jefferson, Aaron Gordon, Kawhi, Paul Millsap, Jerami Grant, D Rose, Amare Stoudamire. All athletic guys that couldn‚Äôt shoot but learned to."
"If you include Embiid, the all-Process Sixers team in 2021 is not terrible     TJ   Covington  Jerami Grant   Dario  Embiid  Christian Wood  Nerlens  Richaun Holmes  Ish Smith  Jakaar  MCW"
"AG is not a comparable defender to Jerami Grant, he's way better."
"I mean look at the 2016 thunder roster that Westbrook took to the playoffs. The only players that are still in the league are Steven Adams, Jerami Grant, Sabonis, and Oladipo. Grant and Sabonis were both really young and no where near the players they are today, and Oladipo was awful that season.  I'm not saying Draymond, Kent Bazemore, Andrew Wiggins, Oubre, and Wiseman are better (they might be, but I haven't watched any warriors games). But Steph doing worse than what russ already did and gets called GOAT level lmao"
"I‚Äôm not saying Beal is better than MPJ lmfao. I‚Äôm just saying he‚Äôs not necessarily a better fit. You realize that fit is a thing, right? Jerami Grant puts up flashier numbers as a #1 option than Gordon did, but Gordon is a better fit for the Nuggets and is better than Grant in the role we need him to play. From a fit perspective, literally the last thing the Nuggets need is a medium-efficiency volume scorer who is one of the worst defenders in the league at his position. It‚Äôs a leap to suggest that Beal would become a 70% TS scorer at lower usage, he‚Äôs never been that efficient."
"NO to adding another prospect.  Its wild how much picks can devalue once you select a player vs before  They should definitely shop Wiseman + Wiggins + picks and see what pieces they can add immediately. Not even sure who would make sense, maybe someone like Jerami Grant to slide  in at the 3."
"How is Clippers a better team? You're bringing up regular season as if that fucking matters, it's the regular season. You think Jazz are actually the best team in the league?   Point is Clips brand of basketball doesn't and won't translate in the playoffs. Over reliance on jumpshots and isos. They get none of the easy looks that teams with actual playmakers get. Their defense isn't as good as it should be. Clips just have too many red flags, while Denver has little to none after getting Aaron Gordon to fill in the Jerami Grant role.   The real question is, what makes Clips a better team than Denver to you? I surely hope pointless regular season wins aren't your argument."
"People don't understand how long it takes players to get to their prime/peak. Jerami Grant has been in the league since 2014 and he's just now getting there. That's 7 seasons for those counting out there.   I don't think anyone would disagree with the fact that the generational talents usually show it right away, and the good players can take time to get there."
"Also, I looked through all of your messages to me, and I really don't think you ever told me whatever point it is you're trying to make if I didn't cover it already.   I said ""Let me know where I'm off or what I'm missing"" and the response I got was not from you, and it said ""[I mean he would barely be over 20ppg without his elevated FT rate, do you consider Jerami Grant an elite scorer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/micvjm/highlight_jokic_catches_and_shoots_a_layup_all/gt5vs4u?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)""  Is that the point? That he would score less if he didn't get to the FT line as much? Sure, good point, thanks for bringing that to my attention."
"Idk though. You watch the Pistons broadcast and they open it as ‚ÄúJerami Grant and the Pistons‚Äù. It‚Äôs def great for his brand and he‚Äôs going to make a lot more on endorsements at the minimum. I mean a lot of people think he‚Äôs really a star this year, that wouldn‚Äôt have happened as a 4th option in Denver even though he was dank in the playoffs."
"No need to bring Jokic into this, we're only talking about Embiid.  I think it's convenient that for Embiid you point to his career numbers instead of this year and compare him to Jerami Grant for this year and not his career numbers. Some consistency there would be nice.  If Embiid got 5 or 6 free throws per game (which is fewer than he deserves) he would still be scoring well above 20 PPG and far better than Jerami Grant. In what world should those guys be getting to the line at the same frequency?   Regardless, that's not the point. We're not going to agree on how many calls Embiid should be getting. Either way, this is a guy who scored 20.2 PPG as a rookie and now is basically scoring 30 PPG. He's shooting efficiently from all over the floor. Is it that crazy to think that he's actually a good shooter and shouldn't be defined by career stats when he's just now hitting his prime?  I don't see how you can look at a guy who has always averaged 20+ PPG, is averaging 30 now with good-great shooting all over the floor and say he's not an elite scorer regardless of how many free throws he shoots. Also, getting to the line is an important part of scoring, so that should boost his case if anything."
Some Detroit fan tried to argue Khris Middleton and Jerami Grant with me lol
Jerami Grant
"Because Jerami grant only gets like 6 FTA per game. If you cut Embiid down from 12 FTs to 5 or 6, he‚Äôd be scoring similar volume at similar shitty efficiency.   You‚Äôre making the assumption that he COULD magically score at the same efficiency if he didn‚Äôt have his hallmark method of getting points. That‚Äôs nonsense- remember that this is a player whose career eFG% is 51.7 before this year. That‚Äôs not even that good lol, he‚Äôs not as talented a finisher as you guys like to imply. And that‚Äôs with extremely generous calls that wipe away most of his misses. Compare that to Jokic who has a 56.8% career eFG on an awful whistle. Embiid just isn‚Äôt that good at scoring from the field compared to how he presents himself."
"First, you're making an assumption that he couldn't find other ways to score if getting to the free throw line wasn't working. Second, if you remove free throws then Jerami Grant scores a good bit under 20 PPG, so I don't see how that's relevant."
"I mean he would barely be over 20ppg without his elevated FT rate, do you consider Jerami Grant an elite scorer?"
His contract ends in 2023. Nobody is giving a 30 year old jerami Grant the bag. He's gonna end up taking less money to jump on a competitive team after a pointless stint with detroit essentially throwing away 3 years of his prime
It's like Jerami Grant is an after thought with MPJ stepping up and the acquisition of Gordon.
Jerami Grant is so overrated on defense. He made huge improvment on offense but people honestly acting like he carried Nuggets defense
"Nah I'm good dont worry. I live in a poor city. You can probably figure out which one by looking at my profile. I rent a 2 bedroom house for under 500/month. Thats what I meant by life changing. I dont make a ton of money, but for my city I do ok and its very very low COL. Ive always made really good money on 1st score, going back... 8ish years now. $800 on Dawson Knox in the afccg on $40, $600 on gronk in the sb, hit on Isaiah Mckenzie on the Bills twice when his odds were above +4000 last season. And those are only a few, I could name about a dozen more just from last NFL season alone. Im... phenomenal at figuring out game plans and that may sound snotty but oh well, it true. 1st score, the odds are so high i only ever have to spend $20-40. Ive only been at it for NBA like 3 weeks, If you check my post history, even before that hit, I posted a miss i had, got 2/3 specifically saying I'm getting closer and closer every night...thats only one night where I got 2/3. I got 2/3 Four nights in a row until FINALLY hitting (getting impatient on +55000 odds. That it took a whole 3 weeks). I got 2/3 again last night, kristaps and Jerami Grant were my 2 guys. I should've just thrown 10 on just those 2, but I tossed them on tickets with Brook Lopez, Morris on LA, Joe Harris etc. Got greedy.  4k is practically life changing in now I have some breathing room. I can make these bets for the next 30 days in a row, not hit a single thing and not worry (spend $20-40 a night). That ain't gonna happen. But its just 4k is by far the largest amount I've ever won and now I can try and take another step up with these bets. Instead of winning 2200 on $4, im gonna be able to put $6 on it, make it a 4k win. Once I hit another one, I'll be able to do $10. And so on. Slowly but smartly. I appreciate the concern but im good. If I can keep doing what I've been doing I can actually start looking at buying a house"
outside of losing Jerami Grant you guys are returning the same cast that played alongside him in previous years when you were the 2nd and 3rd seed so it's a bit of underacheiving

"100% it adds to his value, he‚Äôs a great player and almost unstoppable driving to the rim. His offensive arsenal is massive &amp; can beat anyone on the dribble, stop &amp; shoot from anywhere on the court. He‚Äôs showcasing talents no one knew he had.  Jerami Grant with the Nuggets was a 3&amp;D player that could pop up with athletic cuts to the rim every now &amp; then, defending the opposition‚Äôs best player.   Jerami Grant with the Pistons does all of that, except, now he‚Äôs averaging 24ppg, and an entirely new offensive skillset. It‚Äôs allowed him to take his game to the next level."
"If you want to watch a young core develop over the years from being bad to good then how‚Äôs the perfect time to be a detroit pistons fan.  We‚Äôre ass this year but so far 3/4 of the rookies we‚Äôve drafted have looked solid, and it likely could‚Äôve been 4/4 if one of them didn‚Äôt get injured 7 games in.  Jerami Grant looking like the most improved player his first season as a #1 option if the NBA doesn‚Äôt randomly say ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù and give it to Julius Randle who‚Äôs basically putting up his same numbers from last year.  Hamidou Diallo is likely to breakout here after putting up 19 last game on a minutes restriction and doing solid today too.  Then you can see vets ball out as they try to revitalize their careers here.  Shit we lose a lot, but most our losses are within 2-3possessions. I think are win margin, which we don‚Äôt get a lot, is by like 5.5pts.  We‚Äôre not a good team right now, but we have some promise.  If you wanna watch a team that‚Äôs winning now then watch Portland or Miami. Hard as shit not to love Dame or Jimmy Butler and both teams are fun to watch even without knowing who the rest of their rosters are."
"Not gonna lie at the start of the game I saw Jerami Grant and Plumlee out there and figured ""oh Jokic must be out for a game"". Then I went to run the BBQ, and now halfway through the second quarter, I've figured out that one of the teams is in fact the Pistons and not the Nuggets."
We‚Äôre setting records highs on O and lows on D We‚Äôll have to play 4 on 5 whenever Kyrie doesn‚Äôt show up but at least we‚Äôll have a sick highlight reel.  2nd round/CF exit  Kyrie Jokic Beal Lillard Jerami Grant
"Honestly I thought they were much deeper last year. Joker playing his best basketball yet to make up for that, but Jerami Grant was a huge loss. BTW is AG really that much better than Grant?"
Was curious about clutch minutes. This is the list:  1. Damian Lillard - 135 (77.7% TS) 2. Zach LaVine - 116 (58.4% TS) 3. De'Aaron Fox - 106 (56.9% TS) 4. James Harden - 98 (69.8% TS) 5.

"Depending on how far you wanna go back, I‚Äôd go Sixers.   For this exercise, I‚Äôm assuming only they get the power of foresight. Just for a quick primer, not getting to deep into late picks and such:  Draft Devin Booker instead of Jahlil Okafor  Draft Tatum at 1, or trade back from 3 with Sacramento for 5 and 10 (was a rumored possibility at the time) and take 2 of Fox/Mitchell/Bam.  And then instead of drafting Zhaire Smith, draft SGA.  Additionally, they‚Äôd retain some selection of Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, Covington, Saric, etc. to fill out the team with those new guys, Ben, and Joel."
I know you meant void but I like to imagine the locker room just missed hearing Grant talk and Gordon does a spot on Jerami Grant impersonation lol
We lost Jerami grant and Plumlee in the off season. Luckily we did moves at the deadline to try to replace them
"Given how many players have been injured this year, I think he has a shot. Have to figure Durant, Kyrie and AD don‚Äôt make any. You also have to figure guys like Sabonis, Tatum, Jerami Grant maybe, Zion all have a shot too at taking the 6 forward spots on the 3 all nba teams."
"Yet Shaq gets destroyed for this take on here.  I personally think it‚Äôs very reasonable. If Jazz add another high level wing player, they will be a force to be reckoned with. Don should go all out to get Jerami Grant on the Jazz tbh."
"ty lue   (also: devonte graham, jerami grant)"
"Actually I‚Äôm not. The Sixers didn‚Äôt start tanking until the 2013-2014 season. In the 2012-2013 season they went 34-48 when they still had Jrue on the team. During the draft, they traded him for Noel and used their own pick at #11 to draft MCW.   As to player development, go look up all of the former process Sixers that are still in the league. Guys like Covington, Jerami Grant, and TJ McConnell wouldn‚Äôt have lasted long in the NBA if they didn‚Äôt get all of the minutes they did due to the Sixers giving them playing time that they otherwise would not have received."
Don‚Äôt think the Thunder have amassed such an obscene pick load just to have a Jerami Grant reunion
Jerami Grant maybe? Weaver has said he‚Äôll trade him for multiple picks
"Not a Spurs fan obviously, but I think it's a solid framework for a team. I don't think they have anyone who's going to be a consistent All-NBA player or anything like that, but they've got some good pieces throughout their roster that a top level player (especially a top level wing) would turn into a legitimately threatening team.   Of course, that's way easier said than done. It's remarkably unlikely that they'll be able to sign someone to be that piece given that it's San Antonio (Jimmy Butler honestly probably was their best shot there, but even then, that clearly wasn't a likely scenario at all), you can't count on drafting someone like that when you're a fringe playoff team, and I don't see how they could trade for someone like that while retaining the pieces that would make it all work.   Like you said, it's hard getting to the point of being a genuinely good team that's a legit championship threat. There's just not that many guys that are actually capable of being the best player on a contending team, and getting any of those players takes immense luck and (generally) an equally large investment, particularly when you're a small market team. I honestly don't know where I'd say they should go from here when working within the timeframe of Pop's likely remaining years. I don't think they have the assets to move up for a top draft pick, which then leads me to looking at the top players on underperforming teams that maybe could make that next step under a top level coach like Pop. Even then, though, that's a pretty barren list filled with a ton of maybes and ifs, and you basically are locked in once you make those moves given the limits of their draft capital. The best players that I think they could realistically get considering team circumstances would be players like Jerami Grant, Brandon Ingram, Christian Wood, and others like them. Really good players for sure, but do I think any of them (or even all of them) would be enough to put the Spurs into a contending window? Not really, no."
Jokic at #39 instead of Jerami Grant.
Sixers would have taken Jokic instead of Jerami Grant at pick 39.
"Ahhh I understand what you mean now.  Yeah he could pull the Jerami Grant route and it could end up helping him a lot.   Yeah he‚Äôs improved but he‚Äôs definitely not ready to be a primary ball handler yet unless his handle gets better.   He‚Äôs always been good in transition, it‚Äôs the half court game that‚Äôs a problem."
Randle is gonna run away with it but major shoutout to Jerami Grant and Michael Porter Jr
Just skimmed through but Jerami Grant is definitely not better than Draymond Green
‚ÄúI grew up idolizing Isiah Thomas. Now I get to play with Jerami Grant.‚Äù
"The only candidates I see are Randle (runaway), Jerami Grant, MPJ, Jordan Clarkson, and Jaylen Brown"
Randle by a landslide but MPJ and jerami grant might get some votes.
Ben Simmons?  PG: Ben Simmons / Malcolm Brogdon Marcus Smart  SG: Terry Rozier / Alec Burks / Buddy Hield  SF. Mikal Bridges / Norman Powell / Gary Trent Jr  PF: OG Anunoby / Jerami Grant / Marcus Morris  C: Myles Turner / Nikola Vucevic / Jakob Poeltl
I‚Äôm pretty sure we would give up jerami grant for that
Jerami Grant
the pistons arent middling but jerami grant
Jerami Grant
Yes and the Jerami Grant signing was horrible and Troy Weaver should be fired  I didn‚Äôt say the Pistons would be at the ‚Äútop‚Äù
"Randle is not the Most Improved player. He averaged 20 PPG his last two    seasons. He's at 24 PPG this season. People just slept on him. He's    already been a proven scorer. Michael Porter Jr., on the other hand, has    gone from 9 PPG to 19 PPG, and has been a 25+ guy since Murray got    hurt. He's the real MIP. Continuing with the Nuggets connection, Jerami    Grant went from 12 PPG as a reserve on Denver to 22 PPG as the offensive    focus on Detroit. Hell, Jokic also boosted his offensive numbers by    about 7 PPG. Last year, it wasn't always clear if Murray or Jokic was    the better player, as Jokic would sometimes refuse to attempt to score    while Murray was dropping 40 or 50."
"I'm glad that they didn't do the compulsory firing for a bad record when he was clearly given shit to work with. He's running his offense through Jerami Grant, who is good, but that's far from ideal."
On a god-awful Houston squad.  It's the same way Jerami Grant is going off for Detroit. Decent players become 20PPG players on the worst teams in the league.
Is Jerami Grant considered good?
"I was born in New Jersey and was a Nets fan growing up. Moved to Detroit recently, and there's no way in hell I'm leaving the fanbase with Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kai Irving for one with Jerami Grant, Killian Hayes, and Isaiah Stewart. I'll watch Pistons games and hope they win, but they'll take the backseat."
It's not revisionist. Where's Terrance Ferguson? Where's Josh Huestis? Raymond Felton? Tell me how Steven Adams is looking in NOP?   Only guys doing something off them teams is Jerami Grant who's role was ridiculously diminished cuz he played alongside Paul George. And he didn't even break out fr until going to Detroit via Denver.
"Honestly not worth getting into it with guys like this. Westbrook dragged OKC to 47 wins and the playoffs in 2017. His best teammates were Steven Adams, pre-breakout Oladipo, and Andre Roberson. The rest of the relevant guys were rookie Sabonis, pre-breakout Jerami Grant, and Enes Kanter. Guys like the dude your replying to definitely takes one look at that roster and thinks Westbrook had a good supporting cast because Grant and Sabonis are around allstar level now, but those guys were averaging under 6 ppg and weren't nearly as good as they are now. You can't argue with guys who clearly have never played or watched basketball in a meaningful way and base their entire view off of stats and hot takes. During the Thibs and Butler Minnesota stint, these were the guys calling Thibs and Butler assholes/idiots for having a supposedly antiquated attitude. Now, Thibs is a COTY candidate, Butler took a team to the finals, and the Wolves have sucked ever since. Guys with takes like these have no understanding of the intangible side of basketball and it causes them to spew nonsense because they can only interpret what is told to them or on the stat sheet."
"lmao where did the lakers get the assets for AD. building through the draft, if not the final step, is definitely the first and a major step for any team to want to be great in the near future.  case in point: you look at how the pistons were stuck in the mediocrity for so long, with blake and drummond and reggie jackson and that team wasn't going anywhere, nor was it allowing detroit to be bad enough to get a number one pick to boost their team. this year, with a new gm, theyve done amazingly well, to sign a young Free agent in jerami grant, draft guys like hayes, stewart and bey (the former has bbeen a little injury prone, but shown his potential, and the latter 2 have been beasts) and now they're gonna have the slight opportunity to maybe even add cade cunningham to that core. just seeing how bad they were and where they might be soon is proof that getting young players, and hitting on draft picks is huge."
I am an honorary Process Sixers fan and to prove it I'm naming the entire 15-16 team one by one  PG: Ish Smith/TJ Mcconnell/Kendall Marshall  SG: Hollis Thompson/Isaiah Canaan/Nik Stauskas  SF: Robert Covington/JaKarr Sampson  PF: Carl Landry/Jerami Grant/Elton Brand  C: Jahlil Okafor/Nerlens Noel
"Which ones specifically?  Jerami Grant developed in okc from a end of the bench guy to a starting power forward. Terrance Ferguson had a decent sophomore season and then fell off a cliff after Russ left.   Most of the other ""young guards and wings"" didn't really amount to much after playing with Russ so idk how that would be hampering their growth vs. Just be bad. Perry Jones III - not in the league, Huestis - not in the league, Roberson - developed into an all nba defender but couldn't shoot, Jeremy Lamb - I guess he's fine but like meh the Thunder gave up on him for a reason, Alex Abrines - not in the league, Cam Payne -  having a renaissance with the Suns but his broken foot is what hampered his growth.   I would list any young young guards or wings from the rockets last year but there weren't any. So who is the young guard or wing that has been hampered by Westbrook?"
DJ Augustin  Gary Trent Jr.  Jerami Grant  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Nikola Vucevic  Dillon Brooks  Dorian Finney-Smith  Tim Hardaway Jr. (Love that guy tho)
"Ayo, shut your ass up and let us blatantly tank in peace.  Minnesota has DLo, Ant and KAT, we ain‚Äôt got shit but Jerami Grant and 4 rookies who‚Äôve so far done better than expected."
"Might not perfect to give my take but here goes. I think Killian can be a guy that‚Äôs too 10 passer, and maybe Cade can be a top 10 scorer. Maybe Case can be both but having Cade gives us our starting 5 for as long as we got Jerami. Killian, Cade, Bey, Grant, Stewart. That would give us the 2nd best passer, and a top 3 3pt shooter, and maybe one of the more versatile ‚Äúbigs‚Äù (6‚Äô8 oof but that‚Äôs our baby Ben with offense) and Grant is like pre-superstar PG without the silky jumper and just assaults the rim harder. We literally would have a starting 5 we could just run for as long as Jerami is in his prime. Would come down to keeping atleast 4 players from consecutive drafts. We would have a better first option in Cade/Grant, and an elite second option in the other. I think Bey can be a third scorer on a Championship team in his prime, Killian I expect to be somewhere between Rubio and TP but more capable on D. Which I think could end up fitting with this teams construct. The. Beef Stew is a dude that shoots 55% on 2‚Äôs and 30+ from 3 rn, with a better functioning team and being the 5th option could have a guy that shoots &gt; 60% from 2, and 35%. Honestly Cade could give us a team that I would compare to the actual 04 Pistons, our ultimate weakness based on my personal assumptions, is Stewart is 6‚Äô8 (Plumlee is perfect for the off the bench role for now and when we probably trade him we have a gm that can give us a 7 footer to match up.) Offensively we need Killian and Stew to be a actual clips on offense and the Pistons can run a everybody eats offense having 5 real shooters. Between the potential playmaking of Hayes, Cade, Stew then having to pure scorers offensively in Grant and Bey would think they have one of the best 5 man cores moving forward. Grant will be early 30‚Äôs when these dudes hit their primes. Our gm should be able to get one guard for off the bench playmaking, cheap shooters, and a cheap bench big. He was already proved this having done all of that his first off season as GM which has been the best I have seen since at least the Pistons 04 season. If the Pistons don‚Äôt get Cade that would suck, he probably will fit with us best. We are literally a lead scoring guard away from having a 5 players we could maybe run with the next 3-5 years. And he fits!!! So he can step up and walk into a role he should play. Another thing to watch would be Killian taking the step as an actual starter and not a talent flasher. And if that is all he is then the Pistons could just get a BPA if they get Cade. Cade, Bey, Grant and Stew can all play 2-3 positions each so we don‚Äôt have to get overly specific and can insert a player at just about any position. If we get our 5 and they develop into real players like they shown then I think that‚Äôs a lot of length and switch ability and will have an exciting team that can be a problem"
"35 yr old bron bron. Rest of the nuggies were arguably better than the lakers supporting cast. Jerami grant, mpj, Gary Harris, millsap, BOL BOL"
Jerami Grant.
"Man Motown y'all have something brewing there- top pick incoming, jerami grant, Isaiah Stewart, saddiq bey, hamidou, now killiann it's a team worth watching"
"&gt; Whats the vid I wonder  Jerami Grant dunking on KD, lol."
"Yeah I guess so, but there are plenty of guys who score efficiently but they don't have much help so they are the only one who can score well, it doesn't mean the stats are empty, cuz someone needs to score points. Guys like Kelly olynyk, jerami grant, Collin sexton, Shai gilgeous Alexander, Zach Lavine, KAT. They all score efficiently and in bunches but their teams are below average or bottom feeders, but they aren't empty scorers. I think jerami is for sure not more than a 3rd option on a championship team but he is with us and helps keep the team from getting blown out every night"
Richaun Holmes and Jerami Grant turned into pretty good players too
Sounds like you're describing Jerami Grant
"Yea for sure.   Portland could also use Jerami Grant, a 23 ppg wing/forward with elite D. But he‚Äôs gonna cost a lotttt of picks knowing our GM lol, and he‚Äôs more of a scorer than a playmaker"
"Well not always, like Jerami Grant for example has a much bigger offensive role this season but his defence has actually improved this season too  It just frustrates me cause he has superstar potential but seems borderline lazy on defence. A point guard with a 6‚Äô10 wingspan could be absolutely *elite* defensively."
"LMAOO I know a pistons fan aint saying this... jerami grant and plumlee get pulled constantly, and youre mad about old ass Al Horford..."
"On his fourth steal, Jerami Grant felt embarrassed so he stomped on Matisse‚Äôs entire hand to be a bitch..."
"These are like the perfect average above-average stats. Like somewhat impressive stats on average shooting. I hesitate when I see it because you wonder how many guys could do it if they got the chance to, it‚Äôs like Jerami Grant (His numbers are pretty close to these this season). It‚Äôs a good sign he can do it as a rookie because it‚Äôs a solid floor that he theoretically can grow from."
Money and playing time like jerami grant made the move to Detroit. Oubre wants to be a franchise cornerstone type of player no matter if he can or can‚Äôt be isn‚Äôt the question
I'm not even a Nuggets fan and I still get angry at Jerami Grant for going for that layup.
"beasley is an offense only guy and we got enough of that. perimeter defense was our primary weakness and beas contributed to that. Him doing OK with increased usage on a basement dwelling team means nothing to me.  We gave Grant the same contract and he was poised to take the 4 from Millsap -- as was planned and made no secret in Denver. Jerami wanted to shoot for a max on his next contract, wasn't gonna happen if he stayed in Denver"
"ok heres 20-25 (im not gonna do 25+) ppg scorers. i was curious so i looked. i think hes better (on offense) than only rozier and grant on offense (and im not even sure). i understand simmons plays a non-traditional role on the sixers, but seth is still wrong imo  List of 20-25 ppg scorers: Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton, Julius Randle, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Ingram, Paul George, Jerami Grant, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Terry Rozier"
"Iunno man. Hield just got a $20+ million per year contract and I think Wiggins is better than him. Aaron Gordon is on the end of a $76 million over 4 years contract and his best season was 17/8/3. Jerami Grant, who is a year older than Wiggins just got a $20 million per year contract and his best year was 14/5/1. And people are acting like it's a steal with him averaging 22.5/5/3 this year and those numbers Wiggins could definitely hit as a first option.   Wiggins is almost certainly gonna get a second max or a near max, in my opinion, unless he takes a cut to stay with the Warriors."
"I guess that's fair, and Jerami Grant has almost lived up to the overpay. Still don't get what the plan is there, though."
"Funnily enough between Nerlens, RoCo, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes and Christian Wood we actually had some decent NBA talent (now, at least) on the 10-72 roster"
"Nuggets IMO. They had Jerami Grant as a role player off the bench if I recall correctly. Come to find out, he‚Äôs an all-star caliber player. They had Malik Beasley and Juancho rotting at the end of their bench last year. When Beasley was traded to Minny, he showed that he was a 20 Ppg scorer. Juancho is also a starter now. This year they are even better and probably have a better bench too."
"Turner isn‚Äôt worth 20 million dollars a year for being a pure rim protector. He‚Äôs not a great shooter, passer, or screener on offense.   20 mil is around what Randle, jerami grant, Lavine earn and a touch less than jaylen brown. Also a bit more than capella.   That‚Äôs not a plus contract given that he‚Äôs not close to as good as any of these guys. He‚Äôs not an albatross like Bertrans is at 20 a year, but he‚Äôs still not a great deal.  And ainge wasn‚Äôt the only person who made that valuation. He emphasized that he shopped Turner around to see what his value was, and nobody wanted to give up anyone good for him.   Indy played themselves, just like they always do by refusing trades with Boston."
"Why are you acting like Terrance Ferguson was terrible? Dude played great defense while shooting 38% from 3 on 3.6 attempts, thats good.   I don‚Äôt think raw PPG stats are gonna tell you anything about a role players performance especially when considering that stars in the playoffs will naturally shoulder a larger offensive burden and will take more shots as a result   Also wasnt OKC in 2019 one of the best defensive teams? They had PG13(a DPOY candidate), Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel, DS17, Ferguson, Adams and Markieff  2020 had Gallo, DS17, Dort, SGA, Noel, Adams, Bazely    Wouldn‚Äôt say thats a huge difference in fact one could argue the former had better personnel   I dont think either Westbrook or PG13 played all that well that series at least from an efficiency perspective"
"2020 Terrance Ferguson in the playoffs: 10 minutes per game. 2019 Terrance Ferguson in the playoffs: 25 minutes per game. They did not have a 'better version' of Terrance Ferguson because he was never good. They just did not have anyone at all better than him to play. I'm sorry, but even if your starters consist of Paul George and Russell Westbrook, if your #7 guy is 25 mpg of Terrance Ferguson you are a terribly constructed roster. Period.  Steven Adams averaged 3 less points, Jerami Grant averaged 2 less points, Dennis Schroder averaged 2 less points, Terrance Ferguson averaged 2 less points, Markief Morris averaged 2 less points... all than their regular season averages. The Thunder lost 2 games by 5 points or less, despite getting 11 less PPG of production from their already atrocious bench outside of Schroder.  2020: Shai lost 3, CP3 gained 4, Schroder lost 1.5, Gallo lost 4, Adams lost 1, Dort gained 6, Bazley gained 1, for a net gain of .5 PPG.  So yeah, I'd say losing 11 PPG of production for the 2019 squad while the 2020 squad lost nothing is a pretty big deal. The 2020 squad was also a fair bit better defensively in 2020 than 2019, and defense means more in the playoffs. The 2019 squad's strength was scoring, and the rest of the squad went cold in the playoffs. Russ and PG13 showed up and did their jobs. The bench didn't.  Cp3's run was very impressive, but ultimately he had a deeper roster and better load distribution among the supporting cast."
"He did good work with guys like Holmes, Jerami Grant &amp; TJ.   TJ credits him all of the time for being in the league."
"I'm asking because I didn't start paying attention to the nba until 2016. Was Brett Brown good at developing? I'm just thinking of all of the potential the team has wasted: Fultz, Richaun, Saric, Simmons (basically being the same player since his first year except for improved defense), and Jerami Grant.   Yeah, I know this is coming from a Wolves fan."
"It's quite the opposite. The bar for Russ is sky high for some weird reason.  Most disappointing series was the Utah series that was lost primarily because we played Melo more than we played Jerami Grant.  Their 2nd year, Paul George literally lost his fucking shoulders and we didn't find out that til afterwards, that ONCE AGAIN, Russ was playing hurt.  He doesn't need a fucking finals mvp. He needs good health, and as the original argument stated, a better team surrounding him.  I'm not sure how you guys are arguing this shit."
"Basically everything you mentioned, aside from the fact that Detroit isn‚Äôt a desirable free agent destination, can be blamed on our poor front office decisions. Which, we are clearly taking the first steps towards rectifying. We have a new GM in Troy Weaver who worked alongside Presti in a very successful front office and so far has made some great moves. His first draft was a major success, each player is showing real promise and he turned the #16 and #19 picks into top 5ish rookies this year. Getting rid of Blake was necessary and that contract can be fully blamed on the SVG Win-Now era. Weaver also bet on Jerami Grant and he‚Äôs flourished ever since coming here."
"People don't acknowledge it because it's not true.  His 2P% is .479, which is lower than every single player above him in scoring except Jerami Grant (a mediocre scorer who has the ball a lot on a bad team), Randle and Mitchell (two players that attempt tough shots and score points in the midrange, and arguably have similar shot selection issues to Russ). This is a guy who's supposed to feast at the rim.  He shoots more threes than Giannis even though they're comparable in quality, even more than Jokic and Embiid (who are both respectable shooters).  The free throws are obviously a big problem but his shot selection remains the biggest drag on his efficiency."
What I would give to watch that lineup with Jerami Grant instead of Jrue... He's not as good of a defender but it would be like a process dream.
"Two of our rookies ‚Äî Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart ‚Äî have received all-rookie first team talk the whole season, while Killian Hayes is raising eyebrows all over the place with his playmaking (if you don‚Äôt believe me, consult Zach Lowe‚Äôs latest column and a recent video analysis by Kevin O‚ÄôConnor).   Of all the tanking teams, we have been by far the most competitive game to game, and our rookies-only tank lineups end up winning games they aren‚Äôt supposed to, with fans from opposing teams regularly tipping their hats to the young guys‚Äô spirit.    We‚Äôre also on track to get a top-five pick in the upcoming draft and our highest-paid player, Jerami Grant, is by far a net positive and totally bought in to playing in Detroit and seeing the rebuild through.   So take it back. Take it back!!!"
"Y‚Äôall Houston and Detroit are really doing your part to tank so hard it makes up for it though.   Between Detroit sitting Jerami Grant and Plumlee five days in seven nights and you guys giving Horford DNP - Good at Basketball for the second half of the season, I mean it‚Äôs ridiculous lol"
and then 5 mins before the game NEWS: jerami grant shoulder OUT from holding water
Bazely at 75% would be this season of Jerami Grant. The only reason I don't see that as his full ceiling is because Bazely already has better court vision and passing than Grant does.
Love me some Jerami Grant
Superstar Jerami Grant about to have a 50 point revenge game in a 30 point loss
Jerami Grant for Cade Cunningham??? YES PLEASE
"What makes you think Jerami Grant signed for that reason?   He signed  for 3 years 60 million and has a much bigger role in Detroit than in Denver. Players go to places where they get more playing time to blossom all the time.  I heavily doubt it has anything to do with ""this organization was nice to role player x 5 years ago so let me sign with them""  It's always about self interest."
"Except for example Jerami Grant, the guy signed with us last off-season. It's a career, and people have different criteria for where they're going to sign. Detroit will never compete with LA or Miami location wise, so they have to give other reasons to draw people in."
Bruh you guys just straight up sit Jerami Grant and Plumlee 6 of every 7 games. I don‚Äôt understand how you aren‚Äôt getting fined lol.
#Nah Jerami Grant has the worst roster for any superstar  Hope that helps
&gt; Jerami Grant  &gt; superstar  Wut
Nah Jerami Grant has the worst roster for any superstar
shout outs to bryan colangelo trading jerami grant for half a year of ersan  underrated awful trade
"Yeah ? Is that why LeBron shot 10 free throws over the first 3 games of the WCF combined ? Did he forget to ask for them ?  Meanwhile Jerami Grant got 12 free throws in Game 3 alone. Did the refs think he was LeBron and get confused ?  It's only ""blatant"" to salty ass Denver fans and Laker haters."
Didn't Jerami Grant shoot more FTs in one game than LeBron had in the first 3 games or something ?
"He lead a team of Sabonis, Jerami Grant, Roberson, Dipo, Adams and Kanter to losing in 5 in the first round. Insane."
"People always ask why someone would ever want to be a mod. It's not the delusions of grandeur. It's not the feelings of power or authority (you have a lot less than people think, and you spend a not insignificant amount of time and energy fighting with useless admins who don't understand their own site).  It's the custom flair.  (I still miss Jerami Grant; knew he was going to be a stud from his very first season here.)"
"Hey, I cared! But yeah, that's pretty much it. Similar reason why Jerami Grant wasn't getting a ton of MIP buzz this year. He's been sitting a lot now so it makes more sense, but even early in the season he wasn't getting talked about as much as he deserved."
"Imma have to disagree. Playing meaningless games for a player who is worthy of competing goes against all parties interest. Let me point out Its very hypocritical to say this as a warriors fan, when tanking steph ""broke his hand"" for 70 something games a year ago and landed yall a second pick. If you arent aware my guy, Westbrook has come back after a broken hand after 2 weeks, 70 games is a reaaaaaaaaaal long time for that injury. The warriors did it when it benefitted them.  &amp;#x200B;  Hypothetical: they play grant in this meaningless game when he is supposedly injured. The pistons still lose, but Jerami grant tears his ACL. Now the pistons as a franchise are even more crippled as their best asset is broken and untradeable. Imagine they played steph early coming back from injury last season and he also tore his achilles? These scenarios do not at all benefit a team. One more thing to keep in mind, this is a shortened season with an alarming number of injuries lately, nearly every night another dude is going out. But you are upset Jerami grant isnt playing the last 15 games when he was injured? Just seems hypocritical based on the flair, all im saying."
The bench is   CP3  SGA  Kmart/Oladipo  Sabonis (or Jerami Grant who played better when he was here)   Ibaka  11th man is Melo
"No I think Jerami is better offensively than Horry was, and Horry was miles better than Jerami at defense. I‚Äôm on my phone but Horry averaged like 6 FA/game playing less than 30min a game whereas Grant has not been a defensive standout but is showing he can be relied on as a volume scorer taking 17 attempts/game this year. Bob never ever had that capability, as his strength was being a defensive anchor. You can‚Äôt build a team around that. It‚Äôs like building around Trevor Ariza as someone said below, or Joe Ingles. It‚Äôs a fair question!"
So you agree with the Jerami Grant comparison
A lot of people probably said that about Jerami Grant but here we are
"I don't disagree, that's why I made the comparison to Jerami Grant, a high end role player who got thrust into best player on the team"
Jerami Grant had a career high of 13 PPG and Detroit offered him a bag to be the best player for them
People dismiss all of our opinions on out own players like this. It‚Äôs hilarious. ‚ÄúJerami Grant is good‚Äù ‚Äúnah it‚Äôs just because the Pistons suck‚Äù
"Yeah, they needed someone to fill the Jerami Grant role and he‚Äôs been great"
"i mean everyone that made them fun to watch or interesting is gone.....KD, russ, the big neanderthal adams, pg13, s√ßhr√∏d√©r,CP3, heck even gallinari or jerami grant....whats left to watch....?"
"I'm glad he's doing well. I think Detroit knew he was on his way out the door when they signed a guy who plays the same position, Jerami Grant."
"I forget.... Have members of the nuggets front office been poached the last few years? Of course the players get credit, but they've been the deepest team in the league for a minute. To think they've had so much talent that they've had to get rid of guys like Malik beasley, jusuf nurkic, and jerami grant so that those players can find teams with more available minutes."
"Perfect example for the flaw in your comment is the Denver Nuggets. Never tanked, never tried to tank, always competed after the George Karl blow up in 2013. They did things the right way, highest they drafted was 7, found great mid round and 2nd round value, savvy FA pickups, great coach, amazing player development, timely trades and extensions. Got better for 5 straight years.   Jerami Grant dashes for a bigger role, Gary Harris unexplainably loses his offensive game, Jamal Murray torn ACL, and that‚Äôs with getting unbelievably lucky enough to get two superstar potential players at 41 and 15 in Jokic and MPJ. Winning a championship is just hard. No one way will guarantee you get there, just gotta do your best and some times that means increasing your odds of getting a superstar. Any team could replicate the nuggets model but without the complete dumb luck of Jokic AND MPJ that‚Äôs a 6th seed at best."
"I mean most of the players who were traded off or waived were done so after Hinkie was booted.  The 15-16 team had Jerami Grant, Covington, TJ McConnel, Noel, Okafor, JaKarr Sampson, Christian Wood, etc."
"in 2012-13 the sixers were trying to compete. they traded for bynum in the summer of 2012. then he never played for the sixers and basically never played again   in 2016-17 the sixers weren‚Äôt expecting to be good, but they were clearly trying to be  competitive. they signed Jerryd Bayless, Gerald Henderson, and Sergio Rodriguez to try to be competent and a week into the season traded Jerami Grant for fuckin Ersan (love the guy but come on). they planned on competing with Embiid healthy, and Simmons and Saric being here. they went 10-5 in january but simmons broke his foot and embiid tore his meniscus. they tanked for 3 years, and were only all time atrocious in one. the other two years they were just bad  jerami grant played two games ago. so did plumlee"
"How come the fully unleashed MPJ didn't do that with a healthy Murray tho. The murray injury gives him more of an opportunity to take more shots. His shot attempts increased by 8 after the MPJ injury so I doubt he would be playing at the level he is playing rn. Don't get me wrong, he will still play great, but not at the current level he is playing rn. Also how can you say their defense has improved when their defensive rating last year was 110.4 but this year it is 111.4. I also think Jerami Grant is a better defender than Aaron Gordon personally."
"&gt; but the way AD is playing comming off injury, and not having Howard and McGee to guard Jokic, it's going to be not so easy job either.   AD looks like he's well on his way to being his usual self come playoff time. He's not looking labored or limited at all out there, he's just getting his timing and conditioning going, but he's got a few weeks to work on that still. And McGee hardly played in the Denver series last year. Dwight didn't play huge minutes either. The two players combined to play 139 of the 240 center minutes that were available in last year's 5 game WCF. The other 101 were played by AD (the exact same number of minutes Dwight played). This year instead of Dwight and Javale, the Lakers have three options to put on Jokic (in addition to AD), and all three are very different players.   I think that again a Lakers-Nuggets matchup would be a good one, but with Murray out and without Jerami Grant this time, I think the Lakers will win again. MPJ looked good offensively against the Lakers last year as well, but LeBron played him off the floor because he was so bad defensively (which is why Paul Milsap got more minutes than MPJ did). I'll be excited to see that series if that's what we get. Honestly if the Lakers are fully healthy then I expect them to beat anyone they're matched up with, but that's why they play the games."
Lmao I must have missed the sixers trading Simmons and Joel. They only traded trash young guys and ok at best vets. Shit Chris paul and jerami grant are better than anyone the sixers traded.
"TJ McConnell, Christian Wood and Jerami Grant too"
Jerami grant too and nerlens noel although he was a high draft pick.
"We'll see a few starters come out from this thunder team.  They had Jerami grant, Robert covington, t.j McConnell, nerlens noel who all improved afterwards.  Lakers had the same issue where the players improved afterwards like lonzo, Ingram, randle, and Clarkson. And Larry nance jr. Is injured.  They all played not good enough(for LeBron) because of both Walton and because they were so young."
"I think he‚Äôs way more of a Jerami Grant / Siakam-y type than Nerlens, just as far as molds go"
Wiggins is still seeing 1 on 1 coverage regularly though. If jerami grant could get that he would be crazy efficient. Although I do think if Wiggins continues on this upward slope he could be better than grant in a year or 2.
"Jerami grant on the warriors is 100% better than Wiggins, it's very easy to look good playing next to dray and curry"
"Yeah you right. I was thinking of Jerami Grant over Cov  But yeah, so many Sixers fans were saying ‚ÄúNets are only offering picks, why should we overpay‚Äù  They keep forgetting Harden is an MVP player, that was shocking from Morey. He‚Äôs not the one to get cold feet, I was surprised when I learnt Sixers refused to include Maxey"
"Jerami Grant, no, Saddiq Bey"
Not a lot of mention of Jerami Grant - I wonder what the Godfather offer for Detroit is that they couldn't refuse (probably a young asset and two FRPs).
"Factual I was hopeful for them until Markelle went down and Issac was already down really just destroyed them mentally and caused GM go ape shit There only real good ""developments"" have been making Mo Bamba a positive turning Markelle into SOMETHING and Jo Issac who sadly could not stay healthy to help Orlando.  Unlucky franchise even Detroit has a brighter future with Jerami Grant Magics only hope is a few tank seasons and one wild Cole Anthony who I can already see is turning into a what if story"
Jerami Grant is better...
Straight up us Pistons will give Jerami Grant
"You forgot jerami grant who is decent defensively if he isn‚Äôt the only good player on the team.  I feel you, but this year is different as they‚Äôve had a ton of player movement and injuries. I think they could have used McGee better, and played him with jokic. I‚Äôd be down to see a McGee/jokic pick and roll.  Edit: plus Gordon hasnt had a training camp or anything. There‚Äôs still room for improvement next year."
"the USA is so thin at center Drummond and Howard are realistic. After Bam it gets real thin. What Jarrett Allen?  Bam, Jerami Grant, maybe Allen, or throwback to Horward and hope he can give you 8 games of play.  The USA should honestly just take some long leapers for bigs.  Because you can't get any offense out of any of them anyway.  I would guess do you have enough bodies and fouls to match up with Gobert, The Joker,"
I might as well throw in my guy Jerami Grant xD
"That's fair about the Middleton comparison, I just feel like Pippen was longer and more physically imposing than Jimmy (7'3"" wingspan vs. Jimmy's 6'8"").   As far as recent/current players go he's kind of like a better Pascal Siakam or Jerami Grant to me, more of a slasher than an iso scorer (which is what Jimmy has kind of molded his game into)."
"I really hate it when people bring up some scrub big man right now and tell me he would be great in the 90s because he has some post moves. Like the 10 years where the majority of the best players were Cs or PFs? Who could play offense and defense? Andre Drummond wouldn't dominate, Jahlil Okafor would be absolute trash. I understand the game is really different but the truth is we just haven't had big man talent quite like Hakeen, Ewing, Robinson, Duncan, Shaq, Mourning, Malone, Webber, Barkley (if he counts as big) just to name a few off the top of my head. They could possibly be like Jerami Grant types where they score 20 and the team is absolute ass but other than that they wouldn't be good either. I'm glad Jokic, Embiid, and Gobert and making big men more relevant again. They all play differently too which is fun to watch and talk about"
Jerami Grant.
"Jamal wasn't the only problem for the Nuggets. They also lost key guys in the offseason like Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, and the other guy I can't remember his name. Grant really came into his own last year and Plumlee was a solid player for them. Gordon and the Rise of Michael Porter didn't nearly made up for those guys."
They miss jerami grant
If we would have developed some offense around jerami grant this wouldn‚Äôt have happened
Denver should have kept Jerami Grant and Beasley‚Ä¶. And maybe Nurkic ha!!
Jerami Grant 10 billion times better than Aaron Gordon. JG&gt;AG
Losing Jerami Grant was a big hit to this Nuggets team.
Nuggets could really use Jerami Grant
We got Aaron Gordon cause we lost jerami grant.
casuals don't think cp3's maestro level playoff game management is as fun as giannis dunking on jerami grant and devonte graham over the course of an 82 game season.
"Holmes developed elsewhere, kind of like Jerami Grant and Nerlens Noel"
Jerami Grant. He‚Äôs gon have a Julius Randle season mark my words.
"Let‚Äôs see:   - Okafor,  - Noel,  - McConnell,  - Canaan,  - RoCo,  - Ish Smith partway through,  - Sampson,  - The guy who coined the term ‚Äúthe process‚Äù whose name I forget but tore his ACL or something [edit: Tony Wroten, thanks!] - Injured Embiid,  - Dario didn‚Äôt come over yet,  - Jerami Grant, - KJ McDaniels,  - Maybe Furkan Aldemir, and - Richaun Holmes.   That‚Äôs about all of the players I remember for sure."
Jerami Grant is definitely not underrated anymore
"I think Jerami Grant just wanted to be the guy, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.  Dude is underrated as hell."
I'm holding out hope that an off-season in the system with the team will help him fit in better.. but it sure makes you miss jerami grant that's for sure
"You know, I thought jerami grant was nbd last year, but he was number one option every time he played for pistons. He would miss time, immediately come back and be featured as if he were Tobias Harris. That's where I think his trajectory is, and yes the nuggets are missing him."
I remember some Nugget fans clowning Jerami Grant and claiming Gordon was so much better.
No more Jerami Grant to carry Jokic on the other end
"You have good points but the fact that Tatum is literally 1 year younger than him makes these stats pop a lot more because Mitchell literally did the same thing in fact he had a better first round than Tatum last year he was just 23 and not 22. He's right behind mfkn KD and LeBron in playoff PPG like that's insane company and he does it on pretty good efficiency. Also and this is important Tatum plays in the east and Mitchell in the west if last year Mitchell was in the east who knows what time of historic numbers he would have put up but he had to go against mfkn Bubble Murray,Jerami grant AND Jokic with gobert bumming it and Conley mia and he was 1 shot from beating them...."
" &gt;Not that I think anyone is directly thinking ""alright the Blazers got RoCo, no more excuses"" but he does make a starting 5 feel more complete than they actually are  This was definitely the case for twolves and rockets. I feel for the blazers because they just got destroyed by injuries/covid protocol. So their core of defence (nurkic) was missing and having Roco felt like it did nothing for them.  To me the 3&amp;D player is definitely overvalued because it's needed by so many teams. On 1 hand I felt r/nba was completely over valuing Jerami Grant for us when he left.... But then on the other hand we won 12/14 games when we signed Aaron Gordon and our team looked so complete that I thought we could win it all (till jamals ACL..). AG's defence has been a revelation, but like all role player 3&amp;D guys, the 3 seems to come and go wildly."
I think Jerami Grant would be a really helpful addition to this team at the end of the bench. Can provide a ton of switchability on the perimeter and guard some undersized bigs.
"You value the regular season way too much. Barton hasn't proven shit (he was straight garbage in the 2019 playoffs) while Grant played amazing defense on Kawhi and was your third leading scorer in a really impressive playoff run. In the playoffs in a meaningful series I would take Jerami Grant by himself over having both Will Barton and Aaron Gordon. Also you say Grant has ""horrible efficiency"" yet he was more efficient than Will Barton on 10 more points per game. That's why the Nuggets tried to pay Grant but he preferred to be a leading scorer. Keep talking out of your ass though lmao"
Jerami Grant did a pretty good job on Kawhi in the bubble.
"Nah, you lost Jerami Grant so you didn't improve everywhere."
"I disagree. Wizards has 3 major areas they need to fix in order to contend.  1. Get some defense. Especially wing defense. Any sf from melo to bron has a field day on whoevers guarding them, and 4 guard lineups dont work scotty. 2. Acquire a legitimate third star. Someone to replace westbrook as the second scoring option, and adding a third star to compete with brooklyn. 3. Overall quality depth/veterans. More 3 and d vets. seasoned guys who have been there in the playoffs.  Porzingis does not help this at all. Bertans was very streaky, but he was still our best 3 point shooter. You are proposing a trade in which one of the worst shooting teams gives up their best shooter, for someone with his exact same struggles. (awful defense, even STREAKIER/consistently worse shooter) This deal literally has made no sense to me ever since pitched and im not sure if you watch their games or the mavs if you think this fixes it.  A much better trade avenue would be trying to send off deni, salary fill, and 2 frps to detroit for jerami grant. Would give them a legitimate 20+ppg scorer in a reliable sf/pf. Great perimeter defense, consistent shooting, amazing help rim protection. Do not see in any way how porzingis improves that team vs a deal like this."
"This looks like a good place to repeat my somewhat-popular trade idea  Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 2 Blazers 1sts  * 2 Heat 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline. BI is the greatest asset in the trade so the Heat pay the most. They can build around a BI/Bam duo for the next decade.   Blazers sell the farm to contend with Dame/Norm/Jimmy/RoCo/Nurk.   Pelicans sell Ingram to get a better-shooting player who helps space the floor for Zion, as well as four first round picks to help with their rebuild. That leaves them with 8 picks they can trade if needed! Can upgrade PG and/or SF  -- maybe they package picks with Bledsoe to actually get something valuable for that contract. Maybe Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Jerami Grant. Then you run Lonzo/CJ/Jerami/Zion/Adams. Or maybe offer the Cavs Bledsoe and 4 1sts for Colin Sexton. Etc."
"Plenty? Wiggins, Dlo, ibaka/Gasol, jerami grant, Aaron Gordon, vooch, d Rose, cp3, DeRozan prob will if he does"
Boston has it‚Äôs history of racial inequality - maybe it‚Äôs a thing like Jerami Grant where he explicitly wants to be with a black organization and in a black city.   Or maybe it‚Äôs just more money and responsibility lol
"Using CBS rankings only taking American players ranked 75 or after could field a team of   PG: Derick White, Pat Bev  SG: Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry  SF: Joe Ingles, Mikel Bridges, Otto Porter  PF: PJ Tucker, Jerami Grant  C: Kevin Love  &amp;#x200B;  Team would get wrecked by the American # 1 Team, but its not bad"
"It *sort of* changed my opinion, sort of did not. Like credit to him he played great in those two games and really throughout that series mostly.   But I also am very aware that... who's the Mavs best defender / who did they try to guard him with? Maxi Kleber and DFS? Neither is great... So I reserve judgment. The Mavs defense didnt really have a good answer to at least make things difficult on him which the Nuggets did last year with Jerami Grant, and this year will again with Aaron Gordon (should they match up). Both guys are better defenders individually than any Mavs player they threw at him, really. Mikal Bridges is also better, as is Jae Crowder probably, should the Suns and Clippers meet in a WCF.   We shall see is all I'm saying. I still dont overall buy their offense without an elite playmaker. Still think there's too much isolation (though it's better than last year in that respect)."

It is crazy how delusional that guy is. I have never heard one negative thing about AG on the Nuggets until this thread. The guy stepped into the Jerami Grant role that we needed and has been even better than Grant was.   But we should be disappointed in that?
"Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jokic, and Jerami Grant in the 2nd round. Some insane 2nd rounders that draft."
Like I feel if bron/ad were fully healthy and we added a player like jerami grant we could make some real noise.
"I dont think thats clear .  Watchinf Pistons games he just was clearly not able to handle the offensive load they needed from him.   And he still can't,  but you know KD, Kyrie that makes things easier than just jerami grant"
"Trade idea:   Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 3 Blazers 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline.

"First, it's a trade I think the Pistons would be interested in especially if their own pick drops. Secondly, it's time for the Wolves to win. They can't wait for a rookie and I guess you could dangle the pick for Beal but that's not what they need. They have collected a ton of scorers and they need one more two way wing to win. That's Jerami Grant."
Trading the #3 pick for Jerami Grant would be idiotic in my opinion. I don‚Äôt think he moves the needle to make it worth that
him switching on to shroder was huge. totally took him out of the series. he's this year's jerami grant. knows his role and does it well. just a great player that any team would be lucky to have.
&gt; You clearly have a barometer thats off  When Jerami Grant gets moved for two 1sts from playoff teams (which the Bulls aren't btw) please feel free to tag me.
The year before Jerami Grant wasn't putting up 22ppg.  You're not getting him for two measley 1sts.   The trade is god fucking awful.
"&gt;If that's all it took to pry away Jerami Grant, plenty of teams would pony up two 1sts.  Not true, Grant wasnt for sale before the deadline.  &gt;Portland gave up two 1sts for Robert Covington. Grant is way better.  The Blazers overpaid. Jerami was considered around the same the year before and he went for 1 playoff 1st."
"Fuck Yeah.  If that's all it took to pry away Jerami Grant, plenty of teams would pony up two 1sts.    Portland gave up two 1sts for Robert Covington.  Grant is way better."
You think Jerami Grant is worth more than 2 first round picks?  What *do* you think he's worth?
How the fuck does Jerami Grant gets randomly thrown into this trade?  Pistons aren't trading their best player for two bums and two 1sts from playoff teams.
I'm pretty sure you misread his comment. He is saying that POR should trade CJ to another team for a couple of 1sts then trade those 1st to DET for Jerami Grant. Problem with that is *nobody* is trading any 1st round picks for CJ McCollum lol
"Are people actually serious about a Middleton/CJ swap? I can barely see a CJ/Tobias Harris swap happening. If either team does that they'll have a gaping hole at forward.   I think the best thing to do with CJ is trade him to somebody for a couple of firsts and then overpay for Jerami Grant (2 FRPs, a young asset in either Zac Collins or Nassir Little and potentially draft compensation on top of that). The market is slim and it'd be a heavy price to pay but if you have to give Detroit a Godfather offer so you can finally have a proper two-way wing you go ahead and do it."
They need to flip CJ somewhere for a couple of first rounders which along with Zac Collins would be traded for Jerami Grant
"Don't forget Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, and Christian Wood"
"Honestly, they stockpiled a shit ton of assets and just carelessly used or lost some of them/let the players leave in FA.  They're still in a fantastic position, but I'm wondering what this team could be if they had a competent FO.   Just off the top of my head, certain players they had at one point included Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Mikal Bridges"
"Trade idea:   Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 3 Blazers 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline.

"Imo yeah. If kawhi &amp; PG, lebron &amp; AD, steph &amp; klay, and Jerami grant &amp; jahlil Okafor can team up then Kyrie and KD is fair game."
"MPJ is gonna leave the nuggets to be a #1 on a bad team a la Jerami Grant  at some point and put up nasty numbers, so I think his career will be the 'best'"
"yep, he shoulda killed his body and career to watch jerami grant hoist 30 shots a game and miss the playoffs. the man has no honor."
"If Jerami Grant wants to win Detroit over, he needs to posterize Blake with all his might next year."
"I actually thought it would take some number of picks, I just didn‚Äôt really want to say how many or which rounds or years.  My gut tells me 2022 1st and 2024 pick swap is probably enough to get it done.  KP just played an abysmal series, but he isn‚Äôt Andre Drummond lmao.  He‚Äôs not someone you just shamelessly dump.  The guy still has plenty of value.  Plumlee for KP and a Pick would get vetoed by the league lmao.  KP is still probably the 30th best guy in the NBA.  He put up 33rd best PER and was top 15 in win shares.  Jerami Grant was 99th with no winshares.  Plumlee was top 50 PER and somehow 20th in win shares.  It‚Äôs a good trade and I‚Äôd do it if I were the GM of either team."
Why would Jerami Grant get salary dumped? What is Detroit using the space on?
"NYK gets: CJ McCollum  DET gets: Two FRPs from NYK, Zac Collins  POR gets: Jerami Grant"
Don't bring back Melo and Kanter and trade CJ for a Jerami Grant type if you want a half decent defense
What does he bring to them? Seriously? They got scoring.   He does nothing else.   The best possible trade the Wizards could make is for Jerami Grant who can also defend. KP helps them in zero ways
"Agree, if they are hell bent on competing with Russ and Brad, I'd much rather try to get Jerami Grant if the Pistons are selling.   Still need more than one piece to even give the top eastern teams a run for their money though. We have absolutely putrid shooting as a team, number one priority should be to get some shooters in the offseason."
"Norm should not be playing the 3.  Blazers need a Jerami Grant-type player.  Nowadays, you need a wing that can guard both 3s and 4s."
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
Instant win for the Mavs. Jerami Grant is a winning player. He doesn't need to do too much on Dallas just like when he was in Denver.
nO ..not even close to a fair trade. CJ is not worth Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee.
Not without a decent amount of draft compensation   If we could get the number 1 pick and pair cade with porzyngis with jerami grant that could be a solid team. I wouldn‚Äôt trade anything of value for him
Why are people in this thread acting like Jerami Grant is Zach Lavine or something lmao. As soon as grant lands on a decent team again where he‚Äôs the third option or whatever his numbers will instantly go back to what they were in Denver.
"While that can be true, I don't think anyone outside of KP is really playing a role truly not suited to them. Oladipo was mostly being relegated to being a 3&amp;D player who occasionally got to play backup PG. He needed a role where he could attack the basket. Sabonis was being used as a stretch four which also doesn't really suit him and Jerami Grant I think has just gotten better."
"Hear me out guys - Porzingis for Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee.  Mavs get out from that ridiculous contract and bring in two front court pieces to supplement Luka‚Äôs game.  They get a second/third option scorer who plays really well.  Detroit gets star power and a guy who is practically all upside for them.  If he works out, they have a top 20 player in his prime.  If he doesn‚Äôt, they weren‚Äôt planning on competing for 3 years anyway.   I want this trade to happen really badly."
"I think it can be hard to judge the talent on a team when there's such a ball-dominant player on the team. Westbrook's MVP year got called out for ""get him some help"", but look at the guys on that team that flourished when they left and got more touches: Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Jerami Grant all played 1,500+ minutes that OKC season.  Even folks like Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and Cameron Payne are playing key minutes this year for decent teams."
"Wizards defense still needs a lot of work. Theres no viable wing defenders other than Rui. They can't afford to have KP, another - on defense, when they desperately need a + on defense at the 4.   Wizards should be going all our for Jerami Grant."
I think he stinks out loud but he still averaged 20 a game this season. Jerami Grant went from averaging 12 to 22 on the Pistons. Porzingis would surely put up numbers on a team like that getting all the touches
Kp for jerami grant. Doubt the pistons do it but grant on the mavs as the 2/3 option with THJ would be amazing.
"yeah CJ's value gets underrated (maybe not by a lot, but by some margin) due to his defensive deficiencies and some playoff no-shows. But he's still a very good player with a modern skillset and it's no coincidence he's been part of top-tier offenses with Portland. He's a guard who can create his own shot and shoots 9 threes a game at 40%. Ya know how many guys can do that? In a league where shooting efficiency is more important than ever, that's still valuable, even if it comes in a package that's not built to be a defender. Peep the advanced stats - they still paint CJ as a very solid, positive player (and not as bad on defense as fans make him out to be). The problem is that he may not fit well next to Dame.  A few trade targets I see:  * Jimmy Butler ‚Äî¬†would require many additional assets and is 100% contingent on whether the Heat want to pay Butler a massive contract. Very likely they will. Jimmy would be a great complement to Dame as a secondary ball handler and defender, but CJ's volume 3pt shooting would be missed. * Jerami Grant ‚Äî would require some additional assets and contingent on Detroit looking to flip a player they for value. Grant is still somewhat unproven. He turned into an offensive creator in Detorit and after a hot start saw his efficiency dip, as well as his defense. But he has solid size, a varied skillset, and generates 6+ FTAs, something Portland lacks outside Dame. Blazers could bet on him taking another step by becoming more effecient as a second option. * Tobias Harris + Matisse Thybulle ‚Äî 76er fans will probably instantly nix the inclusion of Thybulle. That's fair. But it could be a very attractive package for Portland, and would be worth additional assets to bring in a complementary scorer and versatile defender. A third team may need to get involved to provide value to Philly. * Kristaps Porzingis + Josh Richardson ‚Äî call me crazy, but I think KP has become a distressed asset whose potential is actually underrated. The Mavs let Luka go full Harden-ball, leaving his teammates standing like statues beyond the arc. (That's fine, Luka's good enough to justify that). But skilled bigs require more creativity to use and the Mavs showed no interest in getting KP involved through DHOs (something Portland loves), elbow face ups (where KP's height can really shine) or screening actions (another Blazer fave). This move is a big gamble, but Portland has kept its powder dry for years. Time to take a swing. If it misses, it means Dame time has run out. But that window is closing anyway."
"Kenyon Martin Jr/Sr, Tim Hardaway Jr/Sr, Gary Payton II/Sr, Cole Anthony/Greg Anthony (never realized he was his son until just now), Seth and Steph Curry/Dell Curry, Austin Rivers/Doc Rivers, Glenn Robinson III/Glenn Robinson Jr, Domantas Sabonis/Arvydas Sabonis, Jerami Grant/Harvey Grant (and uncle Horace Grant)...  There's so many more current players whose fathers played but I don't remember watching their fathers... it's crazy..."
They just need to not panic. Teams sometimes do that after a disappointment ending and start making changes for the sake of changes. There was a lot of quality players that went for cheap last season.  I think we could see say Jerami Grant on the move this year. Indy has lots of quality players who could get auctioned off. Feels like Smarts future in Boston is a bit up in the air. And Portland could start getting desperate as well with clock ticking on Dames prime.
KP for Jerami Grant straight up
Even Jerami Grant would‚Äôve gotten them over the Clippers this series
A long shot is Jerami Grant. They got a good rookie class and Grant would certainly fetch a fair amount of picks from us. He wouldn‚Äôt be the number one here but he‚Äôd easily be 2 or 3.  Another one I saw on this thread was Harrison Barnes. Easily be number 2. He definitely wouldn‚Äôt be 4th in FGA/g like he was on the Kings.  In a perfect word we mortgage our picks for PG or Tobi but that‚Äôs not as realistic. I think there‚Äôs a good talking point with the Clippers starting with CJ/Nurk and picks for PG/Zubac.
We‚Äôd be better off with jerami grant
"if the pistons traded our young core and/or assets for another +30 year old star, im killing myself. the ebst we have is jerami grant, killian hayes, Isaiah stewart, saddiq bey, and first round picks. both sides say no probably"
You mean because Jerami Grant was actually good?
Like Pistons fans would fight me for not saying it‚Äôs Jerami Grant lol
"Y‚Äôall well take him, u can take jerami grant"
"I personally think CJ + Picks for PG13.  Then Dame, Powell, PG13, Roco, Nurkic could be enough to make some noise.  The issue is, is that enough for the clippers. Could they use the picks you guys send to get another borderline star like a Jerami Grant?"
"Jerami Grant type player, could go to a bad team and put up good stats"
Kuzma to Detroit for Jerami Grant (with picks / other stuff coming from the Lakers) makes a lot of sense to me. I've been calling this for a while.
"compared to his rookie season, i mean first of all his overall eFG his higher, his FT is less because he almost never gets to the line now and literally attempts less than 2 FTs a game so that number is a wash. His 3p% is basically the same as rookie year, you don't even point out how much he rebounds offensively now which is huge. 1.6 a game is excellent for someone in his role.   The scoring numbers are really not a big deal, once again he's more efficient overall than his rookie season. The scoring number is a direct product of how many touches he gets. All of his stats basically show a standard NBA level player. If he didn't belong in the NBA he'd be looking much worse.   I mean once again, if Kuzma was getting enough touches he'd be a Jerami Grant tier offensive option, which really isn't that bad. He is in all honesty one of the more fair contracts in the league. Makes what like $10 million a year to be a solid NBA role player with upside? There really isn't anything wrong with Kuzma other than him having an awful playoffs this year but last year he was decent and the entire Lakers team was pretty bad in the playoffs outside of LeBron."
"Because he was just 2nd team All NBA, and deservingly so, and guys like Jerami Grant and Kevin Love got a nod before him."
"Detroit is in a really good position if he does live up to the hype too.  Jerami Grant balling, good looking rookies this year, Cade Cunningham.  That‚Äôs a real nice setup."
He carried a team projected to win 20 games to a 41 win season and made 2nd team all nba and jerami grant was taken over him lol
And Olympian Jerami Grant ;)
"I'm right there with you - I think Pistons next year have a good chance of making the play-ins and I can see a world, even if for me it's an unlikely one, where they're the eight seed. Saddiq/Isaiah/Cade looks like a great young core, and even better if Killian can sort it out I'm extremely excited. Also Jerami Grant is cool."
"Jerami Grant was the 39th pick in the 2014 Draft. While the 76ers should be commended for a brilliant pick, everyone will forever give them shit for not taking the guy who went 41st Nikola Jokic."
"OKC has the best player in Shai, Dort is really good, and obviously a ton of picks.  However, I believe the Pistons have the better overall prospects and potential/fit as a team. Bey and Stewart already proved as rookies that they are very valuable players in the modern NBA. Killian Hayes still has a ton of potential. Obviously Cade coming in is a great prospect. He could be a superstar very soon. Even Sekou is still an unknown at still 20 years old. Then you throw in Saben Lee who surprised as a 2nd round point guard, and 3 second round picks this year (37, 42, 52) which could be packaged along with a player to move back into the first, this Pistons have quite a collection of solid young players. Plus Jerami Grant is the best of both teams veterans, and fits perfectly with the young core.   So basically at this time I'd say the Pistons will be better sooner. Now this can obviously change if Cade busts, the Pistons rookies from last year don't really improve at all, the Thunder hit on a few draft picks, package them for a legit star, or outright win the lottery, Poku actually becomes a good/great player, or if there are injuries, etc."
Thanks for your write-up! A few comments from my end:  1) I don't see any of the teams discussed here actually wanting Rozier; who's complained a ton in the past when he doesn't get starter's minutes. Rozier's obviously got fit issues at a 6' shooting guard and I really think that limits the amount of teams he can function on.  2) I'm not convinced anymore that Detroit would be open to moving Jerami Grant - he's an integral face to the rebuild and he'll pair exceptionally well with Cade.  3) Indiana taking Bagley is a hard pill to swallow!
I‚Äôm going to say this with as much respect as I can. Jerami Grant is a bum
"Honestly I'd say it makes sense considering this is his real breakout season, but then again we have Jerami Grant, Keldon Johnson, and McGee who all have never gotten an all star appearance so kind of disrespectful"
Jerami Grant was a big name free agent? Lmfao.
*Jerami Grant has entered the chat*
"They need 2 way wings and a 3&amp;D Center. Not a bad defender. Thry need to go after guys like Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner"
"it is ironic. also, the fact that people were complaining about keldon johnson but totally ok with jerami grant just goes to show how little this sub knows their players"
"Jerami Grant yelled, ‚ÄúThere we go!‚Äù Draymond Green gave a look of pleasant surprise. Jayson Tatum belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before Keldon Johnson hit the locker room door, ex-USA Olympic star Carmelo Anthony hugged him and said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
"OKC. Shai and Dort are nice pieces to build around and they have a bunch of picks. I will say their picks/assets aren't as good as people are making them out to be.  They have first rounders from Denver, Dallas, Phoenix and Miami, all teams that should be good for years to come and too far in the future to make any claims either way, but some of LAC's and Houston's could be big.  For Detroit we don't even know if Cade will be good and they don't have the assets that compare to OKC at all. I also see Jerami Grant getting traded at some point to a contender."
Jerami Grant out of health and safety I see.
If the pistons were suddenly good next year I wouldn't expect other fans to have watched them that closely this last year is my point. Most people aren't going to have strong opinions on saddiq bey or jerami grant until the pistons make the playoffs and beyond that probably win at least one round. I have no expectations that people will watch the pistons when they're bad.
Cause they‚Äôve got Jerami Grant in that role &amp; hes better
Jerami grant for one stayed in Detroit because he‚Äôs around people that look like him and overall the culture
"Seems like no one is really doing a starting 5, so here we go:  PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: Terry Rozier  SF: Jerami Grant  PF: Eric Paschall  C: Jahlil Okafor"
"I agree that Jerami grant is probably better but Wiggins isnt booty cheeks, hes only sometime cheeks"
Wiggins is booty cheeks   Jerami Grant is not
Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Bradley Beal  Damian Lillard
Kemba Walker  Tobias Harris  Jerami Grant  Pascal Siakham  Wendell Carter
"CJ for Jerami Grant? Powell in the backcourt with dame, nurk down low, covington and grant at forward? CJ can pump his numbers as first option and Detroit can get more assets at the deadline. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Pg John wall or Kemba ( they just at that point in their career) So Cj or buddy hield or joe Harris  Sf jerami grant or Otto porter jr ( young) Pf aaron Gordon or Julius randle  C andre Drummond or Kantwr super obvious
Every kid gonna be rocking the jerami grant and kevin love USA jerseys next school year
"I forgot about Dozier completely, I guess that's why they had to go after Rivers.  I feel like Barton has always been out and they're use to playing without him. But agreed they were definitely short handed.   I was pretty surprised they got by without a 3 and D wing. They lost Gary Harris , Torrey Craig, and Jerami Grant! I've never considered Aaron Gordon to be a 3 and D wing but he did a good job on defense in the playoffs."
We would need to send him to a team who is starting a rebuild. CJ is on contract for 3 more seasons at like 33m/yr.  We also need a wing. So who is a wing that helps us improve and is also making 30m/yr? Nobody fits that bill. Like‚Ä¶ we could send out CJ and picks for Jerami Grant and Plumlee. Doesn‚Äôt help us *enough* but also doesn‚Äôt really help Detroit either outside of just some firsts that have potential to be high lottery.  If Miami strikes out in FA this year Butler could be available next year but there‚Äôs another scenario where CJ‚Äôs contract is a major negative. Would be 2 years at like 35m/yr  Need a miracle to have it work out.
"idk, it's the East, anything is possible too with the play-in. 10th place this year was Charlotte with a 37 win pace. Last year it was also Charlotte who were on pace for 25 wins. So let's assume 10th place is on average a 30-31 win team in the East.  Detroit won at a 22 win rate last year (20-50), a core of Sadiq Bey, a full season of Jerami Grant and Cade Cunningham could win 30+ IMO. Then it would just take winning two games against a Chicago/Washington/Indiana level team."
"we got keldon johnson, jerami grant on the team, no room for trae"
"Oh right, Jerami Grant is still playing, my bad"
...jerami grant is a good nba player. this isn't 2014  grant can actually play defense and knows how to fill a role without being the 1st option  he was great for the nuggets in his role player role
30 out of 30 NBA franchises would take Jerami Grant over Kevin Love  Not really sure what point you‚Äôre trying to make
Jerami Grant is a much better basketball player than 2021 Kevin Love.
"I'd give him credit for drafting an all-rookie first team and all-rookie second team player in his first draft for us.Bey and Beef Stew were playing really well at the end of the season. Also, a lot of people gave him crap for the Jerami Grant signing and that turned out way better than expected. Hopefully COVID doesn't keep him out of the Olympics."
"Everyone becomes a play finisher when they're on the floor with Jokic. Jerami Grant was also a play finisher when he was playing on the Nuggets. MPJ is playing with the greatest passing center maybe of all time, it would be stupid to even try to utilize him as a shot creator when you have Jokic *and* a good point guard in Murray. You seem to be completely ignoring the context of his role in this particular offense."
"Jerami Grant isn't anywhere close to as good as Zach, so maybe chill with that shit."
"Sexton would be a nice replacement for Beal's spot now that he's out, imo, idk why that dude gets hate but he could do well in a similar role as Beal. He's a walking bucket, great shooter and great off-ball.   MPJ, John Collins, and JJJ would be good good replacements for Jerami Grant now that he's out. I'd also take any of those guys over Kevin Love right now.  I'm assuming you forgot Ja, but he's another great young PG who could play instead of Trae if he were to be injured or not play. Maybe not the same level of playmaker Trae is, but he's still a good passer and altogether dynamic player.  IMO, I think Team USA could've definitely used a classic 7 footer type center to matchup size if needed over Kevin Love, and Jarrett Allen is probably the best USA product to fit that mold right now. Bam is good but he's more of a skilled small ball 5 and hybrid 4, fits a different profile. Draymond as well, he's a point forward PF ideally."
"With all due respect, the only guy I wouldn‚Äôt take lavine over in a vacuum are Khris Middleton and Jerami Grant. But on this team, those guys could serve a defensive purpose. Beal doesn‚Äôt matter anymore anyway tho so Lavine might be more needed than before"
wtf was jerami grant doing on Team USA in the first place??
"Kevin Love, Jerami Grant, Darius Garland, yea sure why not Tobias Harris too in the same vein."
Is it both Jerami Grant AND Brad Beal?  A little confusing because they're both entering protocol but only reports are Beal being replaced.
They should call up Bey tbh. Especially if Jerami Grant is gonna be in protocols too. Or Mobley ffs.
Jerami Grant is the guy on the team that plays defense and hustles
"There's no space for that on a broadcast show, just literally no time unless it's Inside the NBA, and they do it pretty well. On a podcast it should as long as the host doesn't have a massive ego about their opinion.  With Simmons it depends on the opinion lol. Like he flipped hard on Trae Young over the course of the playoffs and he explained it really well why he flipped. But his undying hatred of Jerami Grant has been bewildering, dude's not an allstar but Simmons said he'd rather have Huerter than Grant. like come on, just admit you were wrong when you said it was a horrible contract/decision to leave Denver lol. But that won't come until Grant's doing this on a winning team, which is all that Bill cares about and to a certain extent I do agree with that idea that scoring a ton while losing a ton is overrated in today's discourse."
"They‚Äôre under max contracts which is exactly why Denver won‚Äôt be able to pay MPJ, Aaron Gordon, or anyone else who‚Äôs going to demand a larger salary. Same reason why they lost Jerami Grant, because they couldn‚Äôt pay him enough to stay. Nuggets are so fucked with Jamal Murray being given a max contract."
Can I get a source re: Tatum not being vaxxed? The guy has long lasting side effects from when he got Covid so he's a total idiot if he didn't get the vaccine knowing how dangerous it could be. Looks like Dame was vaxxed. Beal unknown but he's obv in the protocol. Jerami GRant is also in the protocol.
"I did a write-up a while back about the opportunity of exploring a CJ trade because I do think that's a plausible idea for Indiana. This trade though is giving up way too much for CJ though.  Here is what I had:  Indiana gets: CJ McCollum, PJ Washington  Portland gets: Jerami Grant, Jeremy Lamb  Charlotte gets: Domantas Sabonis  Detroit gets: Zac Collins, 2021 and 2023 first round picks from Charlotte  https:/np.reddit.com/r/pacers/comments/nxwkr5/oc_a_fourteam_trade_between_indiana_portland/"
they did that AFTER a lot of those guys were given away. so sure. add Butler and remove the guys he was traded for. Jerami Grant sure would be nice. so would Bridges. and Noel or Holmes to backup Joel.  not sure of your point
"So the roster right now could've conceivably been:  **PG:** Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell.   **SG:** Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton.   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Jerami Grant.   **PF:** Jayson Tatum, Robert Covington, Dario Saric.   **C:** Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I'd assume you turn a lot of those assets into a star to start at the 2 in that team, like...I don't know...Jimmy Butler?"
"Orlando gonna put him on that Jerami Grant to Detroit treatment. He gets his money and gets a larger role for a tanking team with no expectations, the tanking team gets a vet presence and someone to eat up minutes for a low-expectation year while meeting short term salary floors."
"Does Simmons make sense with Fox and Haliburton tho? Why not ship Hield Bagley and picks for someone else maybe a Jerami Grant, Myles Turner, Julius Randle type guy?"
Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  Jerami Grant
"Getting Dario, Embiid, Jerami Grant and Holmes are bad draft choices? I don't think he'd do terribly"
"He's made good moves in his time there. He got Embiid, Dario, Holmes, Jerami Grant and RoCo. He's already had a better track record with those than the Colangelos and Elton who had much more assets."
"your last paragraph isn‚Äôt true at all. Hinkie acquired Covington, Holmes, Jerami Grant, Saric, Noel, McConnell. that‚Äôs a nice haul considering none of them were super high picks.   trading up for Fultz squandered assets (heavy debate on whether or not Hinkie would‚Äôve made such a move, however could also be argued this was a good move at the time regardless). they let go of Grant for little. traded Holmes for nothing. McConnell let go. traded Noel for garbage. took Smith over Bridges. and while Horford was ‚Äúonly one year‚Äù it wasted an entire year of Embiid‚Äôs prime and boxed the franchise in. it ended up ok after a year but it was still a waste. and i‚Äôm not sure if watched Harris vs Atlanta but he‚Äôs still not nearly worth that contract because he can‚Äôt be a second scoring option.   i think Hinkie would‚Äôve easily handled everything better than what we got. JMO."
"Noel and Embiid were both injury concerns, which explains the Okafor pick decently well. There were also reports that Hinkie was ready to sell high on Okafor the spring of or summer after his rookie season, a la MCW, but he was fired too quickly.  As far as talent evaluation goes, people always seem to forget he was responsible for taking chances on several players who have been contributors to playoff teams. TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerami Grant, and Christian Wood to name a few.  I think he would've shined the most retooling a championship contender, in the ilk of his old mentor, Morey. His real strengths were less in the lottery and more in the late second round, acquisition of G Leaguers/undrafted players, and trades. All things the Sixers could use now."
"Lol. I didn't say anything of the sort.   Every year we get fans who delude themselves into thinking they'll get a great return for an unrestricted free agent in a sign and trade and it almost never happens. The Hornets got cash for Kemba Walker. The Celtics got cash for Gordon Hayward. The Nuggets got cash for Jerami Grant.   Usually when teams get more, it's because a player is a restricted free agent. The Bucks got three picks for Malcolm Brogdon because he was an RFA and they could match. The only UFA I can think of fetching a lot of value in a S&amp;T was prime LeBron James going to Miami. No UFA got a lot of value back for their teams in the last two years. If you can think of one before that, let me know.  I'm not saying Lowry is leaving Toronto. There's a really good chance he stays. I'm just saying if he's leaving Toronto, it's unlikely Toronto gets a lot back in a S&amp;T since that almost never happens."
"I doubt they'd need to include the pick, tbh. Jimmy Butler basically only commanded a salary match. Same with Kemba Walker to the Celtics. Gordon Hayward to Charlotte got a protected second. Jerami Grant got the Nuggets cash considerations.  That said, Indy gave up three picks, including a first for Brogdon. So it's not unheard of."
"PG: Cole Anthony  SG: Payton Pritchard  SF: Terrence Ross  C: Domantas Sabonis  PF: Jerami Grant  Bench: Mike James, Isaiah Hartenstein, Nigel Williams-Goss, Terrence Jones  Btw we counting guys like Kevin Love?"
"uhh why do you want me to name a free agent when we're talking about trading? You don't trade for a free agent unless it's a sign and trade.  Wiggins+Wiseman+2 picks could fetch you someone great like a Vucevic, Lavine, jerami grant, demar, westbrook, etc. I don't necessarily think it would be a great move but I dont think it would be terrible either. For example imagine a starting 5 of curry poole klay draymond vucevic, or curry klay lavine paschall draymond"
"There is absolutely not evidence that Pop is a bad basketball coach, are you kidding me? He has five championships, and these are exhibition games that don't even count. This is also the worst lineup for the US since they allowed pros to play in the Olympics. Somone on the level of Jerami Grant would never even sniff the roster in previous years.  Larry Brown has the most losses in actual Olympic competition as the Us head coach. Is he somehow the worst coach in NBA history?"
"Not always -  there have always been a couple role players on the rosters. Kirk Hinrich, Shane Battier, Tyson Chandler, Kenneth Faried and Mason Plumlee have all played big roles over the years.    But in any case, I don't agree that this year's roster lacks role players. Draymond and Bam are definitely role players - they're just really, really good role players. Jerami Grant has become a scorer, but he was viewed as a 3-and-D wing only 1 year ago. Kevin Love, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday have spent plenty of time in complementary roles in their day."
"For those saying Dame's not a playmaker, on that last possession he called Love up while Jerami Grant was up high, sagging help defenders off and leaving Keldon open in the corner. Didn't get the bucket, but that was a wide open shot."
"I find it hilarious, BUT it is worth noting that the roster currently playing is the worst it's been since pros started playing for Team USA.  Guys like Draymond (a solid 1/3/5 stat line) and Love (a solid 0/0/0 stat line) are only there as token guys for their past rather than anything they actually currently offer.  Jerami Grant played 13 minutes. Known ""stats on bad teams"" guy LaVine played 13 minutes as well. I literally have no idea who Keldon Johnson is and he also played 13 minutes.   Booker, Middleton and Holiday will join the team soon. Even then, is anyone going to confuse this year's roster with the Dream Team or Redeem Team? Of course not. But, say those three do nothing more than take the minutes of Grant, LaVine and Johnson. That's one hell of a better team automatically."
More Jerami Grant minutes pls
Why is Kevin Love getting more clock than Jerami Grant?
"Wizards got all the PG County boys let‚Äôs gooooooo. KD, Oladipo, Uncle Jeff Green, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Markelle Fultz, Quinn Cook, the list goes on."

1. Jerami Grant   2. Everyone else  No bias
"Those aren‚Äôt as low as ya think. Celtics just gutted their staff and traded Kemba for Al Horford.  Not to mention, those picks were for Jerami Grant, not potential hofer Cade Cunningham"
"These aren‚Äôt analogous situations, nor do they have the same parties involved.   Weaver rejected 3 first round picks at the deadline for Jerami Grant, and you think he‚Äôll accept less for the #1 pick?"
We turned down 3 1sts from the Celtics for Jerami Grant. Start there for Cade and we‚Äôll get back to you
They really need to play Jerami Grant more. Such a glue guy. Does all the right things
"how are teams that just throw in nba players going to have better chemistry than already existing teams in the nba.?   yes that's a fair assessment that a lot of nba teams would lose. I personally think even the worst nba team would still have a chance. Even a role player in the nba is one of the best players in the world. Their best player is usually not even an all-star in the nba. It would be tough to stop jerami grant on the pistons, or shai on the thunder, or KAT on the twolves. Maybe the magic and rockets would likely lose. Put it this way: If an nba team had a roster like australia, or france, etc, they would easily be one of the worst teams in the league"
jerami grant is a good defender and team player and i wont hear this slander
Jerami grant and Saddiq Bey are what this team really needs. Sad that the huge egos of Tatum and co will not step aside for the good of the country
This roster construction is wack. Why the hell did they take Jerami Grant and Kevin Love? Where are the playmaking guards? It‚Äôs just a bunch of dudes isoing
"KD is pretty solid on defense when he locks in, Tatum's a pretty good defender, Jerami Grant was known for being a damn good defender well before he was known as an offensive player, and then obviously Khris and Jrue when they make it over are plus defenders.   Point still stands overall, though - not enough plus defenders, too many easily targetable offense-only players. Having a healthy Klay (presuming he would've agreed to go, obviously) would have been huge for the US team, considering that virtually his entire offense can be done off ball if needed."
Jerami Grant got less minutes than Keldon Johnson‚Ä¶ ouch
Isn't Jerami Grant on the roster?
But yeah let‚Äôs choose Kevin fucking Love over Julius Randle and Jerami Grant lmao  Dumb ass Colangelo
And there‚Äôs also the fact that for some reason Jerami Grant and Bam Adebayo are on this team.
Jerami Grant is pretty great.
"Jerami Grant has been doing the little things but he's losing minutes to Tatum, who has not been good defensively or offensively. I'm praying that Jrue and Middy save us after the Finals."
Put Jerami Grant back in!
They not rocking with Jerami Grant
"Him, Dray, and Bam were the only dudes to actually play well in the first game then Pop benched him for Jerami Grant and people acting like he just sucks as a player now (well, mainly just that one Suns flair troll)"
"i tuned in, watched jerami grant score 5 points in 30 sec then they take him out? why"
Damn and to think a yr ago Jerami Grant didnt even start games most of the season for Denver
pop benched tatum for jerami grant ???
Why do they need a superstar? Is philly putting a superstar on the table? I guess jerami grant went to Detroit. Lebron went to Cleveland. Aldridge went to SA during his peak‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs not the only way to spend $25+ mil.

I personally think so. The ceiling version of himself at this point is probably just a slightly worse Jerami Grant so it feels a bit redundant even if he did reach his potential which is looking incredibly less likely.
Pistons I think we either make 8th seed or 15th seed. We also have cap space to sign another Jerami Grant
Jerami Grant is actually really good tho
"Because of Larry‚Äôs age yes, but I meant subbing out Larry Bird for Scottie Pippen (two top 50 players in NBA history) is drastically different than subbing out Durant for Jerami Grant or Saddiq Bey (top 50 NBA player in history for an elite role player / unknown potential sophomore)"
"Sekou is not a good NBA player. He's been given opportunities and he just almost always stinks the gym up with his play. Which isn't to say that he can't be good, but we already have his one in a thousand best case scenario in Jerami Grant. I've watched Sekou a lot including up close and personal in the G-League and I really don't think it's gonna happen for him. I'd rather keep him over Okafor, but I can also understand the desire for having a third string center if Luka Garza truly isn't ready to play any NBA minutes yet.  Also, our new FO is amazing so you don't know what you're talking about there."
"Easily better  We added #1 pick, had two rookies make an all rookie team who made improvements, Jerami Grant got help, upgraded at C and already had a good bench last year. Even purposely tanked towards the end of the season after resting all the vets with like 20 games to go.  We‚Äôll be better, how much I‚Äôm not sure but more than 20wins easy"
"I find it interesting that the Sixers, who worked SO hard to fucking LOSE every year to stock pile lottery picks, seemed to get the most disappointing picks (though they are not all 'busts' exactly).    Nerlens.   Michael Carter-Williams (and he was ROY).   Okafor.  Simmons.   In fact, the only player they drafted during their FIVE-YEAR 'process' that will be with the team moving forward (assuming a Simmons trade goes through) is Embiid.   And they got him the second year.   One of the best players they picked up Mikal Bridges, and they shipped him out straight away but has developed into a solid player.   Ty Jerome too.   They also shipped out Jerami Grant pretty early as well.   That team has just been all about moving and getting assets and throwing everything to the wall and seeing what sticks and jumping off if it doesn't work straight away (with Embiid and Simmons being the only players they have been willing to wait on).   All of that instead of taking the time to develop the talent they get."
"I‚Äôll see your Jerami Grant and raise you one Ron Artest (minus the crazy).  Edit: and yes, my flair does check out."
Has Jerami Grant ever had All-Defense as a realistic expectation?
"Plenty of late talent. Maxey, Thybulle, Shake Milton, Shamet, Korkmaz, Jerami Grant, Richuan Holmes. TLC solid bench guy."
Jerami Grant
If you count Jerami Grant responding ‚Äúy‚Äôall sick‚Äù to Keldon Johnson saying yes as a no it‚Äôs even
Looking at their depth chart:  PG: Killian Hayes / CoJo / Saben Lee  SG: Cade / Frank Jackson / Josh Jackson  SF: Jerami Grant / Hamidou / Josh Jackson  PF: Saddiq Bey / Trey Lyles / Sekou  C: Olynyk / Beef Stew  I mean yeah I think he's firmly in the third string right now. I could see him fighting for second-string minutes against either Jackson or Hamidou.  I'm still rooting for the guy and I think even if Detroit lets him go some team will take a flier on him. Kind of surprised Memphis got rid of him in the first place.
"&gt;The highest margin of victory was 12   [Game 1 was definitely a blowout,](https://i.imgur.com/0FFqYgs.png) that 12 point final margin of victory is super misleading. The Lakers were up 27 points in the 4th quarter of that game, and Jerami Grant was the only Nuggets starter to play any 4th quarter minutes, with both LeBron and AD playing fewer than 4 minutes in that period. Denver's scrubs made up a bunch of ground at the end to make it respectable, but that game was most definitely a blowout.  [The Lakers pretty well dominated Game 5 as well.](https://i.imgur.com/7viZsH4.png) Games 2-4 were competitive though."
"&gt; You are right, he was however a rookie averaging less than half of his current PPG.  Are you not referring to Murray here?  And FYI they had Jerami Grant who is much better than Gordon."
"He's also not an all star and he's 27.  Cade is 19.  If they sacrifice adding potential superstar talent next to Cade so that the team can win 30 games, that's extremely stupid lol. Jerami Grant is not a franchise piece and he's not a #1 option on a contending team. Putting the franchise on his timeline is a big mistake lmao.  If Grant leaves, you say ""oh well"" and replace him with younger talent."
You're talking about Jerami Grant lmao
"If you base your franchise's future around Jerami Grant and not Cade, that would be very Pistons."
Jerami Grant
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous. First is a set of people who have never made an all-star team, next is a list of players who weren't all-stars last year.  &amp;nbsp;  **Never Been All-Stars:**  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **F:** OG Anunoby  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Deandre Ayton  **Honourable mentions:** Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Clint Capela   &amp;nbsp;  **Best Non-2021 All-Stars**  **G:** Trae Young  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **F:** Khris Middleton  **F:** Jimmy Butler  **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns  **Honourable Mentions:** Demar DeRozan, Brandon Ingram, Klay Thompson, and everyone mentioned in the list above."
Jerami Grant for sure
Yeah I understand the games played argument but when he did play he was the closest thing to an all star out of all of those names except maybe MPJ. 17 ppg on amazing efficiency to go along with elite defence.   Jerami Grant is a 4 imo
**G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** SGA  **F:** Jerami Grant  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Clint Capela
"Obvious answer - Harden trade, just pay the man  Less-obvious answer - Don‚Äôt rescind the Tyson Chandler trade  Super-obvious answers - don‚Äôt waste draft picks on Huestis and McGary (Hood and Jerami Grant), trade up from 14 to 12 for Booker instead of Payne, take OG over TFerg  Hindsight is 20/20 answer - don‚Äôt threaten to draft and stash Giannis and just draft, pay and play him instead of Adams, then take Gobert instead of Roberson"
Jerami Grant is pretty free for that one
Jerami Grant would be perfect for the Celtics

Man a wing would be so dope. Buddy for Jerami Grant hmmnmmg
"&gt; I feel like the fact you are just cool with that trade is a massive indictment of how far Simmons has fallen in 76er eyes.  Look, it's Embiid's team. Selling low on Simmons would fall right in line with how the Sixers sold low on lots of dudes over the last few years - Jerami Grant, Noel, Fultz, just to name a few - but if the trade makes the team around Embiid better (I think Ingles and Clarkson would certainly do that) then I'm ok with it.  Morey pulling off a Dame trade would be great, but at this point I'd rather be more realistic and be surprised if something like that does happen."
"It was actually 80 million and here‚Äôs a list of players making the same or more than him next season.  Bojan Bogdanovic, Jarrett Allen, Clint Capela, Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Gallinari, Gary Harris, Tim Hardaway, Buddy Hield  It‚Äôs honestly hilarious how Pelicans fans think losing a 38% 3PT shooter on high volume that plays borderline elite defense and has great synergy with Zion is a good thing‚Ä¶  That defense is going to be godawful this season.  Who‚Äôs your best defender? Hart? JV? Lmfao"
Interestingly Philly also traded Jerami Grant for that pick. Then traded the pick to Orlando for the draft rights to a euro prospect who they ended up renouncing anyway. Then they traded Fultz to get the pick back from Orlando.
"assuming we're using last season rosters since our rookies haven't played yet, would I give up Jerami Grant and Josh Jackson for KAT and Anthony Edwards? Hell yeah I would."

Jerami Grant
"nah unlike the warriors, we don't have that ""go-to"" guy and to trade for such a go-to guy, we would lose a lot of the supporting cast that would make title contention viable. Heck, even if we traded Siakam for Lillard straight up somehow (much like Demar for Kawhi), we'd not be in the best position to compete.  I see no reason to send off Pascal and Fred just yet. Veteran leadership is important for developing the rookies. Jerami Grant is valuable to Detroit for such reasons. Yes Pascal is a little overpaid but he'll be movable when the time is right.  And for those advocating a tank yet again, I don't see why you need to force it. Raptors might still be in the bottom of the standings anyway."
"Look at the top scorers on lottery winners the past few years:   2021 draft: Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, Pascal Siakam  2020 draft: Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall (WTF?), Devonte Graham, Zach Lavine  2019 draft: Julius Randle, Mike Conley, Kevin Knox (also WTF), Lebron James  Well, if you go by that list being eligible players, then I guess it's Lebron... Well, this was a huge waste of time."

Feels super late but I saw flashes of huge potential from Jerami Grant at OKC and a couple of strong seasons since then has kiiiiinda showed that. Though dunno if he‚Äôs hit his own ceiling
Jerami Grant
"Nah 2014 was pretty good. Not great but good and the thinking at the time was it was going to be the deepest since 2003 with lots of superstar potential  Reality was different but it was a solid draft overall. Wiggins, Embiid, Randle, Lavine, Jokic, Gordon, Smart, Capela, Dinwiddie, TJ Warren, Bogdan, Jerami Grant and Nurkic   2 MVP level players. 3 if you include Randle. 4-5 AllStar level players and some nice role players"
"Boston - Payton Pritchard, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Terry Rozier  76ers - Maxey, Thybulle, Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, Milton  LOL, you're in a fucking cult"

"1st rounders:  Guards: Marcus Smart, Zach Lavine  Wings: Wiggins, Randle Center: Embiid  2nd rounders:  Guards: Dinwiddie, Clarkson Wings: Joe Harris, Jerami Grant Center: Jokic    I think the first rounders are a title favorite. Seconds rounders are probably a 3/4 seed in the west"
"There is no one worthwhile for that. To trade for a star we would have to trade wiggins. Now that means the only real holes in our closing lineup are SF and PF but Dray plays PF at the start of gamss which means SF is the only position. Name any SF we could have gotten that is both a better defender and shooter than Wiggins and is overall better than him as well. You can't there are none.   The better players are KD (untouchable plus wouldn't come here), Kawhi (Untouchable), Pg13 (Untouchable unless Kawhi demands he goes), Tatum (Untouchable), Jaylen Brown (Borderline untouchable only would be moved for a superstar), Middleton (Bucks just won a freaking ring they aren't trading the guy that hit the closeout shot). MPJ could maybe count for this categroy but he can't defend, same with Ingram which is why I wouldn't trade for them.   That leaves guys who are in a similar tier to wiggins but are valued more highly due to contracts like Jerami Grant or OG. And at that point you are just using picks to save cash which is dumb looking at you Tillman."

Jerami Grant just killed it for the Pistons in that regard this year.
"I‚Äôm not saying we‚Äôre gonna be in the play-ins or anything, but I think 26+ wins is more likely than not. You gotta remember we rested Jerami Grant and almost all of our veterans for the last chunk of the year and still won 20 in a shortened season. The team adds Cade Cunningham, and a solid veteran in Kelly Olynk who can spread the floor, add in another year of development for Bey, Stew, Hayes, and Diallo and I think this team will win more than 25 games."
"They don‚Äôt know about us man, we had 20 wins last year in a 72 game season and we rested Jerami Grant and most of the veterans for the last chunk of the year. To be honest we were mostly very competitive in our losses too, if you look at the point differential we were a lot better than the other tanking teams. Then we add Cade Cunningham, and get another year of development out of Stew, Bey, Hayes, and Diallo and they expect us to only win like 25 games."

"&gt;That's what makes Hinkie such an enigma. He had some amazing draft picks and undrafted free agent signings, but also let a lot of them go so I don't know how much credit to give him.   Yeah the big question mark with Hinkie is his talent evaluation/team-building ability which we never saw. The OP lists players that were part of ""The Process"" at one point or another but apart from the 1st rounders the only players that they identified and actually leveraged for on-court success or asset value are RoCo and TJ. It's not an achievement to have Christian Wood or Ish Smith on your team for two minutes when those guys were being passed around from bad team to bad team at one point.  Plus there was the criticism that you can take tons of fliers on guys like this, but how much are they going to get to show when playing alongside rookies and other fliers/journeymen instead of instilling good habits. It's not a foregone conclusion that Jerami Grant/Christian Wood/Richaun Holmes etc wouldn't become as good as they did on other teams but the fact they did blow up elsewhere doesn't retroactively make Hinkie look better to me"
Technically we traded jerami grant and markelle for maxey

"Ray Allen, Jamal Crawford, Jae Crowder, Khris Middleton, Jerami Grant"
"Bey should approach 40% shooting this year with better looks, better decision making and growth.  Frank Jackson is a 40% shooter.  Olynyk has had ranges in his shooting, but is generally in the 37% range.  Jerami Grant was shooting 39% from 3 in Denver when he didn't have to be the primary ball handler/playmker. He should be able to approach that again if he is not tasked with the offensive playmaking.  Also, you are looking at last year's percentages which included a shit load of tanking and guys like Rose &amp; Griffin who started the year dominating the offense.  Context matters man."
"And I honestly believe a lot of people posting here literally did not watch the game.  The Pistons rolled out lineups with 3-4 non-shooters around Cade. This won't happen in the regular season when he has Frank Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant &amp; Kelly Olynyk.   A guy like Cade thrives when he has guys around him who can hit shots, and when there is a real system to run.   Summer League fails to provide both of those aspects."
I think Cade will do fine once his teammates are named Jerami Grant and Isaiah Stewart
"Our summer league team is pretty close to our NBA team tbh lol. We are missing Jerami Grant, Beef Stew, Olynyk, and Diallo, but thats pretty much it."
Jerami Grant is pretty good at least
Naw jerami grant and Stewart will start. Sekou is our third string pf probably or maybe he‚Äôs our backup idk  Hayes and bey are starters tho
"This is summer leauge my guy, Jerami grant is 27"
Jerami Grant is enjoying his gold medal
Which one is Cade Cunningham and where is Jerami Grant.
"Len, TT, or Queta/Jones should fill that backup C spot. They grabbed Harkless who was serviceable in the backup SF role at the end of last year.  The missing piece seems to be a solid starting SF/PF  which it looks like they're trying to trade for. Personally hoping they could grab Miles Bridges, PJ Washington, or Jerami Grant, but they would all come at a pretty high price"

"That just means you have to think of wings who make a lot more than the MLE so it would take multiple salaries from the Clippers  So, IDK, Jerami Grant?"
"PG: Damon Stoudamire  SG: Terrence Ross  SF: Kevin Love(Lake Oswego but close enough)  PF: AC Green  C: Domantas Sabonis  Bench: Jerami Grant, Ime Udoka, Dave Gambee, Richard Washington, Terrence Jones, Michael Doleac, Terrell Brandon, Ronnie Brewer, Mike Dunleavy"
"There definitely is enough talent, they just keep pooling to the same 4-5 teams. If we have two more team's, that's a couple more max contracts to lure big fish away from the mega markets. Would it actually work like that? Probably not but there is a lot of talent.  And yes, those teams have a lot of talent. SGA, Christian Wood, Haliburton &amp; Fox, Jerami Grant, Ingram, Sexton, Jarret Allen, KAT.  A handful of the teams you're mentioning were big teams just a few years ago. The rockets, thunder, magic, and Cavs are in planned tank modes to acquire young talent. The Pistons are going to be very good soon. Kings, Pelicans and Wolves have a lot of talent but need to get their shit in order (put the magic in this category as well, but not as much promise at the moment)."
Mitchell Robinson  Rudy Gobert  DeAndre Jordan  Montrezl Harrell  Jerami Grant
"Well, he'll be playing with solid young Center Beef Stew, borderline allstar and gold medalist Jerami Grant, Saddiq ""Young Buddy"" Bey and Killian Hayes. I think his assist numbers will be fine."
Reminder that Cade will have Jerami Grant and Isaiah Stewart rather than Tyler Cook.
"Hang on, isn‚Äôt this Piston‚Äôs Summer League roster basically their starting team? Basically only missing Jerami Grant lol"
"It all depends on wtf Fertitta plans to do with the Rockets.  I could totally just see him saying fuck it, and feeding the ball to Jalen Green while sitting Wall/Gordon, and basically turning it into a 3 man team with Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Jr and an island of misfit toys around them.   Meanwhile the Pistons have a pretty promising young core/starting lineup, and guys like Jerami Grant that'll take up a lot of scoring and shots.     IMO Cade will have the better year from an eye-test standpoint, but Jalen Green will have the stats advantage."
"I would add a bigger role to that also. Lots of guys want the opportunity to have an increased role than what they have currently.  Whether it‚Äôs a 6th man wanting to start, a role player looking to take on more responsibilities, or an average starter wanting to become a key starter.  Obviously the money has to be close but role plays a big factor. IIRC Jerami Grant had the same offer from Denver (and a starting spot) but he took the Detroit one because he got to be the feature player."
"&gt; His roster was putrid  Adams 2,400 minutes, Andre Roberson 2,400, Oladipo 2,200, Domantas Sabonis 1,600, Kanter 1,500, Jerami Grant 1,500. There's even some sneaky minutes for McDermott, Cam Payne and Taj Gibson.   I know some of those guys developed later on, but maybe Westbrook's ball dominance hid some of the talents of his teammates?"
Pistons Summer League starting 5 is basically their normal starting 5 without Jerami Grant lmao
Jerami grant played his team all the way to the #1 overall pick.
So take a current role player and basically make them the star on a bad team surrounded by young or iffy help a la Jerami Grant this last year?   Malik Monk is a pretty good pick but is probably at least this year with the Lakers away from really being able to explode in that situation.  THT on the same team is a possibility.   Coby White with the Bulls is a likely choice I think. The team would lose but the stats would be good.  Immanuel Quickley would probably put up Colin Sexton like stats on a bad team.
Jerami Grant ?
"You're clearly forgetting about Jerami Grant. I'll let it slide, but just this once."
"He‚Äôs better than JaVale on the same team‚Ä¶outplayed Jerami Grant, so yeah nice try."
"Being completely honest, I can't say I've ever watched Jerami Grant"
Jerami grant
"RJ and Jerami Grant are the only ones I see that have a chance.  The East will lose two All Stars, Sabonis and Simmons.  The West would be hard pressed to lose any except for Conley who will likely be replaced by Russell.  So if we are going by deductive reasoning, find the two likeliest suspects in the east and there you have it."
i may or may mot be biased against jerami grant for costing me my fantasy playoffs
"The pride of Flint MI, also shoutout to Draymond from Saginaw and Jerami Grant from the Pistons! MI was well represented"
"javale, keldon and barnes can be decent role players in contending teams. only keldon doesnt have a ring. their skillsets are actually usable. jerami grant is having success leading the detroit armored division, but his mission should not be confused with ""playing good basketball""."
"you meme, but aside from jerami grant,  they are all decent players"
"sure but this roster isn't the best USA has to offer. lebron, AD, harden, KD, kawhi didn't show up. we had keldon johnson, javale, jerami grant warming the benches"
JERAMI GRANT IS PART OF THE REBUILDING PROCESS. DETROIT BASKETBALL
Did Jerami Grant even touch the floor? I did see Vlogger and Big Body during some garbage time minutes.
"Jerami Grant really didn‚Äôt get any burn on Team USA smh, was he injured or something?"
"JaVale McGee, Keldon Johnson, and Jerami Grant join Harrison Barnes as gold medalists"
"JaVale McGee, Keldon Johnson, and Jerami Grant join Harrison Barnes as gold medalists."
"That 6ers team almost beat the 73-9 Warriors   I mean TJ McConnell/Sauce Castillo/RoCo/Jerami Grant/Nerlens really is probably only good enough to win 15 games max against NBA teams over a season, but idk if Giannis and his brothers could even win 1 game in a season against the same competition.   The thing that kills their team is Francis. It would basically be 4v5, which means no matter how great Giannis is he‚Äôd be at such a huge disadvantage there‚Äôs no way he could pull out a win.  Plus if you can shut down Giannis then it‚Äôs really over, and that 6ers team lowkey has guys that could really give Giannis fits. Iirc RoCo finished like 4th in dpoy voting the year the 6ers went 10-72, and Nerlens and Grant aren‚Äôt bad bodies to throw at him either.  Maybe they could steal a game against a historically awful team if that team was shooting like 15%, but I kinda doubt it"
"&gt;Notice that it says best players, not best players on the best teams.  I'm well aware, looked at that definition earlier today. Still, it's pretty clear that the best players are usually guys who contribute the most to winning, and therefore are on teams that win. I'm not trying to advocate for team success being more important than individual, but you're saying it shouldn't matter at all.   It's often easier for players to put up good numbers on a bad team because someone has to score, look at Jerami Grant or Zach LaVine this year. Making that translate into winning basketball is a lot more difficult. Again, if you get great stats but you don't win, what's the point? Would you advocate for LaVine making All-NBA this year? He's at least in the ballpark of Beal stats-wise but he got one 3rd team vote.  &gt;As for Beal being better this year, his stats are nearly identical. He averaged 30.5 last year vs 31.3 this year. His PER was actually better last year than this year (23.2 last year vs 22.7 this year). TS was .58 last year vs .59 this year.  Yeah, his stats were nearly identical after adding another high scorer in Westbrook, that's not easy to do. Often times players lose some of their production when they're joined by another good player.  Not a totally fair comparison but Harden's PPG dropped about 10 points from last year now that he plays with KD/Kyrie.  &gt;Ben clearly didn‚Äôt deserve All-NBA over him  Then why do you think 43 media members voted for him as compared to just 26 for Beal? The voters aren't perfect and frankly I think some of them are idiots, but they are paid to cover basketball as a career so presumably they know at least something about what's going on. Simmons got more 2nd team votes than Beal and more 3rd team votes too."

Nah. They would barely make the playoffs. Oladipo ‚Äòs career is on life support and Sabonis is an empty stats guy. Jerami grant is not a starter in the nba
Jerami Grant
Jerami Grant?
"I once tried to get a pic with PG and he told me he was with his ""family"" and didn't want to be disturbed. It was after a Thunder vs Lakers game in Staples center and I had the opportunity to get in the Thunder's FnF area after the game. I got a picture with Russ and Jerami Grant separately, and Russ even signed my hat. When PG refused my picture I joked that he would for sure leave/request a trade and sure enough he did. Anyways don't get your hopes up."
"Jerami grant is still probably our best player at the moment, trade him for zeke? I love it, roll out the three point guard lineup!"
Better than Jerami Grant? Totally.
"Alright, I mean debatably second option given that most of the pressure was taken off by kawhi and Lowry, Siakam has been disappointing since, including a shameful bubble performance as the number 1 option.   No, you guys annoy me because raptors fans only know how to intake basketball by comparing it to their team. Like seriously man nobody fucking cares, the article is about jerami grant."
Jerami Grant or Isiah Thomas hmmmm that‚Äôs tough. I think I might be leaning towards Grant.
Jerami Grant for Isiah Thomas?  Yeah I‚Äôm down
Denver learned its lesson when they let Jerami Grant go... they need that versatile Forward on the west who can defend and not to be the first option scorer on the team.  I don't think it's an over pay for a 25 y/o who is a solid starter.
I don't know shit about the Detroit Pistons besides Jerami Grant. Haven't watched them in years and saw maybe two games of Cade max.
"Can't forget Horace, Harvey, Jerami Grant..."
"To my knowledge, they did offer Jerami Grant similar money as Detroit, he just wanted to go to Detroit."
Jerami Grant
Is he an upgrade over Jerami Grant?
"You would have said the same thing if the Nuggets had extended Jerami Grant on $20M a year. And it doesn't take 3, it takes 1 team that wants to add talent. Hell, might as well be the Pistons again"
"Feel like I'm wasting my time here. There were zero rumors about Jerami Grant getting that kind of deal beforehand. The Pistons didn't even have that much cap space, they had to get off salary to even make the offer. You have an extremely poor imagination if you can't imagine another team offering Gordon that deal."
Heard the same thing about Jerami Grant
"Did you watch Jerami Grant this season? Because I did, like 50 games of him (around 15 of Gordon's)."
Jerami Grant is a better shooter and defender my guy
"Jerami Grant wanted to be a #1 option on his own team, Denver had matched the offer given to him but it didn‚Äôt matter. Now he‚Äôs on another team where he won‚Äôt be the #1 guy (Cade Cunningham is going to have the ball in his hands 99% of the time)"
"They don't need Aaron Gordon to be anything more than a swiss-army knife guy and he's already bought into that role a lot better than Jerami Grant did.  I do think he's overpaid, but big wings get the bag."
Yeah but this is something a contender kind of has to do. They missed jerami grant even tho they matched detroit‚Äôs offer. You only get so many shots to win it all. So i guess im okay with this. I also generally believe AG is overrated purely bc his offense is so limited despite his ability to ‚Äúdo it all‚Äù
"It doesn't. Literally the only way to make the salaries match is to include Jerami Grant in the trade. The Pistons can't trade all the free agents they just signed (including Lee, Frank Jackson, and Joseph) until December 15th so in order to make the salaries work without giving up Cunningham they have to trade everyone else they *can* trade: Grant, Hayes, Stewart, Bey, and Josh Jackson for John Wall. Nope."
"Real talk? Cleveland or Detroit. I‚Äôm originally from the land so I would love to live there and be with friends and family while making a top .01% salary and enjoy occasional partying (Cleveland does have good clubs and nightlife, just not Atlanta tier). And Detroit interests me for the same reasons it does Jerami Grant, black city and coach, with a cool up and coming team with a lot of winning history. Plus being a decent but loveable player  in either really sets you up nicely, see Bobby Portis in Milwaukee."

"Jerami Grant's best game was far and away the playoff game against the Lakers where he had 26 and helped us win.  Game 3.     Here's the problem, he started that game alongside Paul Millsap.  MPJ only played 22 minutes total and was very limited.  In Grant's best game he really wasn't doing what we expected him to do when we signed him here.  That doesn't take anything away from JG.     He is a good wing defender, but he wanted a bigger offensive role ever since he was on OKC.  We expected him to be a cutter opening up the offense for easy baskets with a lot of offball movement, to be able to knock down 3's to basically replace what Paul Millsap does for us.     He did not do that in that game, or really ever his entire year with us.  I'm glad we did not re-sign him, because he was not a good fit with MPJ and I think ultimately we made the right choice in choosing between those two.     Gordon immediately started eating the free cheeseburgers that Jokic hands out as Millsap so perfectly framed it.  He knows the role.  His cutting to open up  the iconic MPJ 3 last playoffs against the Blazers, and then making the 3 that iced the series was what we needed from Grant.  He was never that, he is a great player and can do things that Gordon probably won't for us.      We are lucky Gordon buys into a role that compliments our other stars like Murray, MPJ, and Jokic.  Ultimately that is more important than which one puts up more points per game."

"Too soon to tell but probably, hopefully yes.    The handful of games before Jamal went down were incredible and AG didn't even know wha he was doing. After our entire backcourt got injured everything went to hell so it's safe to ignore his performance then, although we did manage to beat Portland somehow.   Jerami was really good. Everyone was kinda waiting for him to settle in but it never felt like it happened. He had a few nice game in the playoffs but never seemed to click as much as you would hope. At one point there was this bonkers stat where Grant was the only player to be a net negative while sharing the floor with Jokic.   Really though it's difficult to judge guys like these whose role is to be a defensive Swiss Army knife. For the most part pea brains like us just look at box scores and it doesn't tell us much about their performance."
"Agreed the issue with that point is though that before they broke out you still got a serviceable rotation player in Jerami Grant or Dragic, good role player in Hill and an all star center in Brook Lopez just without a 3pt shot. With Exum you're lucky if he can get on the floor at all and even then his career stats are 6/2/2 per game on 40% from the field and 30% from three.   Basically with your other examples you'd take a flyer on those guys because they're already serviceable, even if they dont improve at all they are still guys good enough to have on the bench or even start. With Exum its like taking a chance on Jimmer or Bennett, yeah there still is some very slim chance they break out but if they dont you're basically wasting a roster spot. I'd rather take a chance on a d-league guy than a guy from the 2014 draft."
THATS JERAMI GRANT MONEY
Kyrie Irving   James Harden  Khris Middleton   Jerami Grant  Rudy Gobert
Jerami Grant
"Lowry, Paul George, Kawhi, Jerami Grant, Giannis"
"This is dumb. They're never going to be major FA spot, and its nearly impossible to get top players at the end of the draft. I'd much they ""overpay"" for MPJ &amp; Aaron Gordon, when it's shown other franchises that have no one on their caliber would pay it (ala Jerami Grant). I don't get how this is a ""bite in the ass"" unless they're not paying their two other stars. Denver is all in for next few years, that's what NBA is all about."
Denver fans: was AG an upgrade over Jerami Grant?
"And Brook Lopez added a 3 point shot in his 9th season..Jerami Grant had a breakout season at age 26. Considering his injury history he hasn't been able to really reach his potential but as he showed in the Olympics he has skill, so yes he can still reach some of his potential."
"This is more like Gordon is the absolute best PF available to pair with Jokic despite his mediocre stats so the Nuggets are willing to overpay.  The Nuggets are probably scared that Gordon might leave just like Jerami Grant so they took no chances and gave him a big ass haul. And if they missed on Gordon, there's basically no PF left to best pair with Jokic. As far as I know, there are no available defensive PFs who  are not a complete disasters on offense and who are also young.  Frankly I'm surprised it's this ""low"". I heard over the summer he was going to get max or near max just like MPJ's expected contract."
"Jerami Grant got the exact same offer he took from Detroit. He wanted to be a bigger part of the offense and I think I also heard he wanted to play on a team with a black coach and GM as well, so he went to Detroit. Trading for Gordon was getting a player to replace Grant because he CHOSE to leave."
I‚Äôm pretty sure Jerami Grant chose to leave
Why let Jerami Grant go the year prior to end up paying a worse player more money though? This contract is larger than Grants
"That's why I said trouble instead of stop.  No one can stop him, but jerami grant troubled him with his length in our series"
Why didn‚Äôt they just pay Jerami Grant if they were gonna throw this money at aaron? He‚Äôs much better than ag anyway
"&gt;Hawks have done pretty decent with late first round picks. We got John Collins, Kevin Huerter, and Jalen Johnson looks like he might be pretty good. If Detroit is rebuilding I think it would be wise to acquire as much firsts as possible and even if they don't want to draft late they can use multiple picks to move up in the draft. That's how we got De'andre Hunter. Jerami grant is good but Cade is so young. By the time he's ready to win I don't know how important grant will be to the team."
"1. When we signed Evan Turner we were one of the youngest teams in the League. Dame was 25, CJ was 24. So no, its not really that different. And regardless, team age doesn't have anything to do with cap management.   2. You have a great team, but its a bit silly to say you'll never need to make more moves. Even the Warriors went out and signed KD.    3. I wasn't saying you should trade AG so much as I question the move to trade for AG in the first place, knowing how much money they'd offer him less than a year later. Its funny you mention Jerami Grant, as hes a similar type of player to AG, and hell be making less money than AG once the extension kicks in. Seems like poor planning to let him walk just to trade for and extend AG a year later.  4. Ok lol"
"The main difference is that our entire core is under the age of 26. So in 3-4 years none of them will be above 30.  The rest of the pieces around the edges will be fine. Connelly is a good enough drafter we can find the guys on the margins and be fine.  We don‚Äôt need to trade for a superstar. We found our lineup already. We have 3 legit max guys that we think can all be stars including the league MVP. What need do we have to try to make more moves?  Are we going to find an upgrade for AG on the trade market? Unlikely. And definitely not worth the chance of fucking around and finding out when AGs contract is up and walks for more money elsewhere, a la Jerami Grant.  Glad you‚Äôre happy with your team. We are happy with ours as well. Not sure I‚Äôd be as optimistic if the tables were reversed, so kudos to you for that."
"So who was better, Jerami Grant or Aaron Gordon?"
Jerami Grant had the same offers from both the Nuggets and Pistons and chose the PIstons. It wasnt about the money.
Jerami Grant was the only bright spot for the Pistons before the chosen one arrived. It‚Äôs going to be so regretable for the Nuggets if he manages to keep up his offensive and defensive production. Truly a beast of a man.
"Seems it's closer to $88m but I'm curious how it's structured. Hell of a lot to pay for Aaron Gordon, especially when they could have kept Jerami Grant for less."
If this is how much they're willing to pay for a 3&amp;D roleplayer 4 then I don't get why they didn't just keep Jerami Grant though lol.
"I don't think it's an overpay necessarily. However, if you put in the context of Jerami Grant, then it's kind of rough for the Nugs"
"Jerami Grant is a really good player, a few late first rounders would equal a big no thanks from me as a GM."
"That was more of a problem in Orlando than Denver. One of the big questions when we were looking at trading for him was if he would be comfortable scaling down what he was asked to do rather than trying to do too much. Primarily because that was exactly what had just happened with Jerami Grant.  I dont really have an issue with any of the shot selection in the playoff games. Due to our injury situation he was bumped up to our third option offensively. For all we know, coach asked him to try to step up and be more aggressive and make something happen.  The story is vastly different with a healthy Murray and Barton slotted in next to him. He had no problem just chilling doing the dirty work on defense and flushing home some lobs on offense. He seemed to genuinely enjoy playing winning basketball. Which probably isn‚Äôt too surprising given how many years he struggled in Orlando and honestly felt like he was often times playing out of his comfort zone and being asked to do too much. I imagine it‚Äôs got to be a bit freeing when you go from a situation like that where you‚Äôre struggling to be ‚Äúthe man‚Äù to one where you just get to live your best life excelling at your strengths and watching a team flourish because of it."
"I mean, it‚Äôs not like the upgrade archetype for Gordon just grows on trees, let alone is available for trade.  Because the upgrade from Gordon‚Äôs:  -	Elite defensive size/speed combination that allows him to switch onto basically everyone in the league at a passable level at worst to an elite level at best -	elite above the rim player who functions as a roll man/cutter -	above average ball handler who is not a liability -	actually embraces his option as a role player on the team rather than wanting to go out and do more (like Jerami Grant) -	passable 3P shooting  Is like‚Ä¶an upgrade in 3 point shooting? I‚Äôm not really sure where else you get that upgrade or what it costs. Nuggets enjoy their flexibility, but there‚Äôs a ton to be said about finding your core pieces that fit around your MVP and going all in by locking those pieces down for the long term.  If you‚Äôre wrong, you‚Äôre wrong. Them‚Äôs the breaks, and such is the life of a small market team. But if you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs rings.  You take the opportunity cost on the rings every day. And a raptors fan should absolutely know this already."
"Interestingly, Jerami Grant will be getting paid less than Aaron Gordon. I'd say Harris, Barnes, Wiggins, Grant, and Gordon."
"Tell me you don‚Äôt watch the games without telling me you don‚Äôt watch the games. And I mean that in the nicest way possible.  He‚Äôs the most versatile defender we have who is capable of guarding wings, guards, and some bigs. And he helps unlock some of our other guys (when we are fully healthy) and allows them to thrive in ways they can‚Äôt without him as the skeleton key on defense.  On offense, his rim gravity as a roll threat makes our offense so dynamic. Because we have two athletic forwards who are both roll threats along with 4 shooters who are all 40% from the arc (Gordon being the only exception), and 4 guys who are all above average to exceptional ball handlers and facilitators, it allows us to be very multiple and dynamic on offense and present very difficult looks for the defense. Stuff like that may not show up on the stat sheet if you‚Äôre just looking at his points/rebounds/assists (which is - no offense - one of the laziest ways of doing basketball analysis and a huge pet peeve of mine).  As an example, everyone is familiar with there 2 man game that jokic and Murray run where we basically clear everyone else out. As soon as we added Gordon, we started adding wrinkles with him as a third man directly in the action with Barton and MPJ as spacers. Gordon and Murray would be running screen the screener actions right on top of Jokic who had the option of running a PNR or DHO with either of them and then he presented the threat of popping out to the three point line as well. And if you send any help off of MPJ or Barton they would bury a 3 - and if any one was caught sleeping MPJ or Gordon would just get a free dunk on a back door cut from Jokic or Murray. Add in the ability for Barton to cut across and take over ball handling duties and reverse the action across the court and it was a lot for defenses to account for.  AG added all of that. Those are things that Gary Harris (who I love to death) and Jerami Grant never added to the offense (despite Jerami also being a plus athlete he seemingly never wanted to cut to the rim for ez dunks). And defensively he might be a slight downgrade against guards compared to Gary, but he‚Äôs a big upgrade in terms of defensive versatility and he‚Äôs a better/more willing defender than Jerami."
Let's not pretend like Porter is some elite rim protector. Denver has done pretty well on defense with traps but and Jokic being better than people want to give him credit for but they probably have a ceiling with the defense unfortunately.  Oddly enough Jerami Grant plus Aaron Gordon together would alleviate a ton of the problems they have.
Confirmed: Evan Fournier is the Lidl version of Jerami Grant.
"If I told you we once had a GM who compiled a team of: Embiid, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Dario Saric, TJ McConnell, Covington, Christian Wood, plus a ton of upcoming firsts and pick swaps, only to be pushed out by Big Collar....."
"Not that it means anything, but if you cross reference the Athletic top 125 with players listed in this thread the order would come out to: Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, DeAndre Hunter, Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby. Also, havent seen him mentioned yet, but Joe Ingles could be in the mix as well."
"that Thunder team also would have had 24 year old Oladipo, rookie Sabonis and pre breakout Jerami Grant.  ""can't win with those cats"""
yea but then again you gotta understand that we're dealing with real people with characters and emotion. not some 2k shit where you know the players are limited to a certain number of actions/feelings.  Does thanasis antetokounmpo deserve a roster spot on a championship-contending team? if giannis hadn't sign his extension yet and the bucks were offered a straight up thanasis for jerami grant trade would they be stupid to decline?   things like that we don't factor in because we have no personal connection to the players.
"Not to mention Jerami Grant actually wants to be in Detroit. He willingly chose to leave a competitive Denver team to go play for a rebuilding team, in large part because he wanted to have the experience of working with a black GM and head coach, in a majority black city.   Even just ignoring any basketball reasons, I see absolutely 0 chance that the Pistons trade away a natural leader who's clearly invested in the organization and the city, for a player who can't even play confidently himself (let alone lead a team of developing prospects) and who clearly wants a big city lifestyle that won't exist in Detroit."
"Oladipo, Jerami Grant and Myers Leonard are good looking imo"
"Horace Grant has more career Win Shares than Dominique Wilkins, Bob Lanier, Dikembe Mutombo, George Gervin, and Wes Unseld.  The issues with Win Shares aside, Horace Grant was a god damn baller, and a lot of people don't even remember him. Probably the best of the Grant family, including Jerami."
&gt; Jerami Grant  Nahh. He's solid
"&gt; A young 20 year old has to experience the humiliation of a 1-31 record by punching out fans in Boston.  It's ridiculous to suggest that The Process drove Jahlil to get into it in Boston. Plenty of Process Sixers who wouldn't have gotten a shot to play otherwise have proven to be winning players for other teams (TJ McConnell, Roco and Jerami Grant immediately come to mind). And the Sixers were that Kawhi shot away from making the ECF.  Jahlil's incident was an isolated one in his career, and for the Process Sixers in general. No young lives were harmed in the making of The Process lmao some young kids did make themselves millions tho"
"Kenneth Faried. He was even the starter in the 2014 FIBA tournament for team USA. He was out of the league at 29 and was already declining for a couple of years prior to that.  I think others are Arron Afflalo and Wilson Chandler. Idk why, but I get the feeling that Montrezl Harrell and Jerami Grant will end up being in this category."
"It was not a half decade. Actually, in the last decade, the sixers only had a 5 year playoff drought compared to the Lakers‚Äô 6.  Hinkie resided over 3 seasons, roughly. Three. His starting assets were: Jrue Holiday, Spencer Hawes, Evan Turner, Thad Young. Missing future firsts that the previous regimes had thrown away, too.  They win 19, 18, and 10 games respectively - only the worst team in the league once during that time. Hinkie gets shoved out the door, Big Collar Colangelo comes in, Embiid debuts (in a season in which they lose true rookie Ben Simmons due to a freak foot injury - thanks Shawn Long!), losing years effectively over. 3. Whole. Seasons. In which we discovered gems like Richaun Holmes, TJ, Jerami Grant, Covington, etc."
"Lol k, simple Reddit search and...  &gt;[\[Charania\] Team USA's 12-man roster for the Tokyo Olympics: Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Bradley Beal, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Zach LaVine, Kevin Love, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Jerami Grant](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o6jsxw/charania_team_usas_12man_roster_for_the_tokyo/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)  Oh, there's an announcement of the roster... is Love's name...

I was actually the guy who drafted the team.   C Nikola Jokic/John Collins/Chris Boucher   PF Bam Adebayo/Ben Simmons   SF Shai Gilgeous Alexander/Jerami Grant/Bogdan Bogdanovic (Atl)   SG James Harden/CJ McCollum   PG Trae Young/Fred VanVleet   Coach Doc Rivers
Jaylen Brown was a massive overpay at the time. Jerami Grant was an overpay too.
Imagine that team with Jerami Grant still as well
"Explain to me how it‚Äôs rushing a rebuild when these teams would‚Äôve been adding a high ceiling 24 year old player who fits their timelines, has only gotten better, plays THE most position and role in the league? On top of that all these teams are in good Cap situations to the point where a contract like that wouldn‚Äôt have hurt them short term or long   Spurs, Grizzlies, and OKC are not going to rush their rebuilds with a max offer to a role-player. NO and Dallas both had bigger sights than I am not arguing with casuals...  &gt;NO and Dallas both had bigger sights than a role-player making a max.   Yes, because these teams sure did have amazing offseasons right? Both these teams missed out on every target they went after outside of Dallas retaining Tim Hardaway Jr for 72mill. If OG Anunoby had went into free agency it would‚Äôve been no different than what happened when Jerami Grant went into free agency last year, and OG literally had a better year this season than the one Jerami did his last year in Denver on top of the fact he‚Äôs also 2 years younger. And I GUARANTEE you if any of these teams had the chance to pay grant what he‚Äôs making to have them on their team they WOULD. The same exact thing goes for OG.   &gt;I am not arguing with casuals...  So I‚Äôm a casual for having a strong opinion and defending it, but you aren‚Äôt despite the fact that you‚Äôve done nothing but reply to me half ass comments, throw insults, and essentially have no rebuttal besides saying ‚Äúno he would‚Äôve have‚Äù???   You‚Äôre really projecting here bud."
Dumb. You‚Äôre telling me that Jerami Grant should‚Äôve stayed a role player on a cheap contract instead of getting payed more money to be a number one option and get an Olympic nod plus potential All Star consideration in the future?
"Many say money as the most important thing to consider, but I partially agree. I persoanlly wouldn't do the move Jerami Grant did with Detroit. Yes, he wouldn't get this much money anywhere else, but he is playing with the worst team in the league while he could be a solid player for a serious contender. So, what I'm saying is that yeah money are extremely important when you consider signing a contract and you shouldn't take major paycuts, but you gotta also evaluate the fit on the team and if where you wanna go there is a winning culture and a solid chance to win with you addiction."
"Jerami Grant, RoCo, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, TJ McConnell."
Cause I'm worried that Kylian Hayes and Jerami Grant won't produce and Cade will have to carry their asses
"He's certainly better than Wiggins. For all the hype Wiggins got for his improved defense, OG is a substantially better and more versatile defender. He's also much more efficient (60.5% TS% vs. 56.8% TS%), a better shooter (39.8% from three on 6.1 attempts and 78% from line on 2.4 attempts vs. 38% from three on 5.2 attempts and 71% from the line on 3.4 attempts), and only a slightly worse scorer (15.9 ppg vs. 18.6 ppg) despite having the ball less (19.3% usage vs. 23.3% usage.) Last year was the first year Wiggins was really even a positive, OG has been an All-Defense level defender for the past two years.   I'd personally also have him over Norman Powell, who I perceive as streaky and a poor defender, but you've probably watched a lot more of him than I have, as a Raptor fan. And I think if you give OG the role Jerami Grant had in Detroit last year, he could replicate Grant's season- and when both were playing as 3&amp;D guys, OG had better numbers. Not sure how I'd rank OG and MPJ, MPJ is a negative defender and a major ball-stopper, but he's such an absolute flamethrower that it almost doesn't count against him."
Detroit have Jerami Grant  and feel their rookies in Bey Stewart were good. Apologies if I sound stupid as I'm only like a year into this sport but Cade does has a decent roster under him there. Agreed otherwise though
"Last gm drafted him and with Casey as the couch it was a poor situation; Sekou was a raw prospect but Casey doesn't want to give guys the minutes to develop. Bad team or not, Casey wants to do everything he can to win the game in front of him. Then Jerami Grant, who plays the same position, became the de facto franchise player. Saddiq Bey is older and more developed than Sekou; his skillset is what you want from a role player, so he naturally jumped in the rotation.   Sekou also dealt with random injuries like concussions that kept him out and missed valuable learning minutes because of the pandemic. Remember that between March and December of 2020, he didn't play organized basketball.   His summer league wasn't good. He had a big game but for the most part he blended into the court. You're expecting more from a 3rd year player in summer league. On the other hand, he's still only 20 years old. For comparison: Saddiq Bey (22), Jalen Smith (21),  De'Andre Hunter (23), Brandon Ingram (23), Davion Mitchell (23), Chris Duarte (24), Tey Murphy (21), Ayo Dosunmu (22), Pascal Siakam (27). I don't think it's fair to write him off yet, but if he's going to grow it wasn't going to be in Detroit."
Jerami Grant is good on D! Boom roasted
"Sixers would be lucky to trade Simmons for Grant straight up, Jerami is a better player"
"While I like the idea of Maxey's shooting or Thybulle's defense in the D, we will never trade Jerami Grant. He choose Detroit for the city and it's people. He may not be able to replicate the numbers he had last year, let alone be a true star, but he is critical to the culture/image of the team."
"What 3rd team would be willing to part with a good player that (1) helps the Sixers and (2) willingly helps the Wolves land Simmons in exchange for future picks?  I can only see Pistons and Rockets who are clearly hunting for young talent and have good pieces that don't fit their timeline - Christian Woods, Jerami Grant.  Wolves out: McDaniels, Beasley, Prince, 2x 1st round picks.  Wolves in: Ben Simmons  Pistons out: Jerami Grant,  Pistons in: Prince, McDaniels, 1st round pick  OR  Rockets out: Christian Wood,  Rockets in: Prince, McDaniels, 1st round pick  Sixers out: Ben Simmons  Sixers In: Jerami Grant/ Christian Wood, Malik Beasley + 1st round pick"
"I've seen probably 2-3 games with him in it, and he looked fine. He knew what he was doing on the court, which is a pretty big compliment for a 20-year old rookie.   And because I haven't watched a ton of tape of him, I supplement what I've seen with basic and advanced statistics which is what they're there for.  Put that all together and no, I wouldn't trade Jerami Grant for him."
"He was good, yeah (I edited my original comment). 15th in All-Rookie voting is solid for the 28th pick and very decent numbers offensively and defensively, but nothing spectacular and definitely not enough to justify trading Jerami Grant for him."
Detroit's not doing that unless it's getting just a *barrel* of first-round picks. That's not enough value for Jerami Grant.
"Why would Detroit trade Jerami Grant who specifically chose the Pistons in FA because [he wanted to play for a Black Coach, Black GM, and a Black City?](https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/)"
"Three-way where McDaniels, Minny picks, Maxey, and Sixers picks go to Detroit, and Malik Beasley and Jerami Grant go to Sixers. There's their third star and sixth man."
"I think it‚Äôs important to think like 5-6 years down the line. Say OKC hits on a top pick (I.e Chet Holmgren) and they become a perennial threat in the west once again. Could anyone possibly imagine Sportscenter, First Take, etc. running segments still discussing whether it was the right move and whether it was bad for basketball? There‚Äôs no way it would happen, I can‚Äôt see a scenario where they get scolded for this strategy no matter what. But 7 years later, despite the fact that tanking gave several low picks chances to become key players in the NBA and landing large contracts (Jerami Grant, Covington, TJ McConnell, etc), it is still discussed seemingly once a week about how the sixers method was a disgrace. It seems like it does really just come down to the market, as for a half decade prior to The Process, the sixers were completely irrelevant and no one gave them a second thought, but for some reason trading Evan Turner and Jrue Holiday from an 8th seeded team sparked a decade long debate.  I guess time will tell years from now about how the media will respond when the thunder picks are said and done, but both teams imo handled their respective situations the right way. The sixers had the Andrew Bynum debacle, and the only way out of that seemed to be to restart, meanwhile OKC lost several MVPs and had to do the same. They‚Äôre similar situations but it seems there‚Äôs no doubt media market size plays a large role."
"Don't really think the Holiday trade is a problem...we shipped him out once we knew we could get Noel who many thought was the #1 pick, and also got a future first (traded for Saric). Very defensible trade.  Hinkie's drafting is really quite strong thought tbh, he was just in an awful bind a couple of times  MCW at 11 (bargain) which he sold high on  Nerlens at 6  Jerami Grant at 39  Embiid at 3  Saric at 12  Reportedly (unconfirmed) wanted Porzingis at 4 but was squashed by ownership and Porzingis' management. Okafor obviously sucked but go look at that draft and tell me the correct selection at 3.  Willy Hernangomez at 35  Holmes at 37  Not to mention the undrafted guys he signed"
Jerami Grant for one year of Ersan Ilyasova. Good ole collars.
"Christian Wood played for 3 teams after us/before Detroit, and didn‚Äôt get minutes there either. Jerami Grant actually did get minutes on our team but was extremely young, didn‚Äôt play well on OKC until his 3rd season there.   Nerlens Noel got minutes, but we had Jahlil and Joel who were all fighting for minutes at C. that‚Äôs on the front office, not Brett.   just admit you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about b"
The sixers also had:  Jerami Grant  Richaun Holmes  Christian Wood  Alex Caruso  Robert Covington  Nerlens Noel
"Doubt it. If he has a good season he‚Äôs going to be looking to get out Chicago imo. It‚Äôll be like the Jerami grant scenario where he‚Äôll leave for similar money but bigger role which helps his next contract. I don‚Äôt see a young, 21 year old combo guard with 20+ ppg upside being cool limited to a 20 mpg bench role just for financial purposes. He can for sure get a starting role on some rebuilding team playing 30+ minutes and get paid for it. I don‚Äôt think we should trade him, he‚Äôs not a horrible replacement at the 2 guard if Zach were to leave."
What kind of package will you be able to make to get Jerami Grant?
I dont think he is getting traded this season but if he did i think he would be in a trade package for Jerami Grant.
"Problem is his offensive game is just too one dimensional. His inside game leaves so much to be desired and could get shut down easily by decent centers or 4s even. His shot is clean but not good enough for that to be his entire game and get good minutes. Another problem with that is when we do give him minutes, the dude is an instant chucker. He plays catch-and-shoot or just straight ISO. Slows down our offense and shows he‚Äôs not bought into the offensive philosophy. Something I‚Äôd imagine would endear him to get more minutes. Both those other centers you named are great offensively but also contribute where they can in other ways on offense.  To your other point, I would GUARANTEE you if Bol Bol went to like the Rockets or Pistons or something he‚Äôd have better stats. Just like all the guys you named, because those are bad teams just throwing shit out to see what works. Jerami Grant balling out did fuck all for the Pistons and on a team where he‚Äôs the 3rd option, his numbers won‚Äôt be that. It‚Äôs what happened with Arron Afflalo back in the day. Decent with us as a 3rd option, near all-star on a bottom barrel team. Hell RJ Hampton did the same last year after going to the Magic. Doesn‚Äôt mean his issues aren‚Äôt still there and he won‚Äôt last long in the league if he doesn‚Äôt improve them."
"&gt; Malik Beasley was out of their rotation than then average 20 as soon as he was traded. Jerami Grant also was obviously much better than they thought he was.  Both of those guys are basically the same guy they were on the Nuggets but getting more shots? And really only Beasley kept similar efficiency. Grant basically just got to be a first option and chuck (not that he was bad, just that him as a 3rd/4th option was probably actually a better role for a team)."
"I just don't agree. And I've watched him a ton.   I don't see how he's any worse than guys like Boban or Kanter who are basically 1 dimensional players. Even Okafor played last year. Hell, Marcus Morris is playing Center on a contender.   I dont see how Bol is any more unplayable than these guys. Maybe he isn't locking down the paint ir whatever but his floor spacing and size are both valuable. I think he can get minutes.   Also, I disagree with your comments about the Nuggets. They are a good team but that doesn't mean they get the best out of all of their players. Malik Beasley was out of their rotation than then average 20 as soon as he was traded. Jerami Grant also was obviously much better than they thought he was."
You could do Wiseman+Kuminga mostly salary matches with Jerami Grant. Don't need to attach Wiggins.
"then who is the better option we should be listening to that has as wide a presence as Kanter???? Beggars can‚Äôt be choosers, if you care about the way people are being mistreated then you can‚Äôt be picky about the people drive the issue.   That‚Äôs like saying fuck what MLK said, let‚Äôs wait until we have someone who doesn‚Äôt cheat on their wife to spread the message of equality.   It‚Äôs not like there is  or some other high profile athlete that‚Äôs speaking out on China that we should be listening to instead. If somebody like CJ McCollum or Jayson Tatum or Jerami Grant started saying the exact same thing as Kanter, then that‚Äôd be great, but in the meantime, Kanter is the only one pushing back.  Is it unfortunate that Kanter may be colleagues with some of those people? Yes (but also wtf they‚Äôre only pictures, Kanter could‚Äôve met those guys for like 2 minutes. Even Ali is pictured with guys Bush and Clinton, Jackie Robinson was ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with Nixon). Everybody fucking loved Obama even though he also killed thousands of innocent people with drone strikes.   If we start calling people guilty by association then every single notable person will be guilty. Like what the fuck are we doing.   Kanter being a Gulenist is atrocious, but we also haven‚Äôt heard him talk about that at all recently (or at least I haven‚Äôt, if you do know of any podcasts/articles/etc of him talking about Gulen I‚Äôd be interested to hear/read them)"
"I think pretty easy to match a $20m player like Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Caris Levert, etc.   Obviously, you'd hope to get a player better than that. But I don't think salary matching is that hard for a mid-tier player."
"IMO Jerami Grant (again, just a worst case scenario hypothetical example) can actually swing a series. Nuggets don't beat the Jazz or Clippers in 2020 without Grant.   And Grant isn't even that good. The Warriors could probably get a player much better than Grant if they are offering Wiseman and/or Kuminga."
Especially with a Wiseman+Kuminga for veteran difference-maker trade.  This team is already good. Suddenly add Klay and (worst case scenario) Jerami Grant and that's a contender IMO. Especially since the West is trash.
"Brogdon, Shai, Tobias Harris, Christian Wood, Ayton      Bench: Jamal Murray, McCollum, Mikal Bridges Jerami Grant, Capela"
"Big Ja Morant fan too  Jerami Grant (prob my favorite)  De‚ÄôAaron Fox  Larry Nance Jr  SGA  John Collins  Kent Bazemore   Luka is fun, but I don‚Äôt actively root for him  Edit: formatting. Also, I‚Äôll always have a soft spot in my heart for Tony Snell"
No Jerami Grant tonight either and it was still a 7 point game in the third. Any update on when Cade is expected to come back?
"Jerami Grant injured, we boutta get daddy dicked down by a team mad they lost to cleveland fml"
"There were a few better options around where Bruno got picked. Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Kyle Anderson were all late first round picks in 2014 too, and then there was Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, and Jordan Clarkson in the second round. Obviously some of those picks are excusable because of how little hype they had, but still."
"Much like how your franchise ran off Jimmy Butler, Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel, Markelle Fultz, and tried to pull a Dennis Schr√∂der on the league by drastically inflating the trade price for Ben Simmons, only to get nothing."
I think your hopes for Cade are too high too quick. Jerami grant is by far the best player on the team
Him jerami grant and lyles have all impressed me in our meetings with them.
"Oh for sure. I‚Äôm not saying he would be what he is in Detroit necessarily (but like you said lots of other factors go into getting better regardless) but to say that it was an okay move is wrong I think. Jermai Grant on the Sixers was worlds better than Christian Wood on the Sixers ever was and was already on the edge of being a valuable role player at the point he was traded. He certainly could have provided as much value as a year of Ersan (on a bad team) over his contract and most likely would have developed at least a little more as well.  And I agree that the Sixers do not have the best development coaching but Jerami Grant was a second round pick process Sixer who stuck on the team for two years (a real sign in those days; we were shuffling anyone and everyone around on 10-day contracts so if you stayed that long it meant something) on teams full of other young developing players. The Sixers have certainly not been close to the player development level of the Raptors or anything but during the Process years they did find/develop a number of late round picks or exiled free agents like Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, etc. It certainly wasn‚Äôt unreasonable for late draft pick young players to develop with the Sixers back then"
Traded Jerami Grant for ilyasova as well
"&gt; Austin Rivers isn't even a shooting guard so, no?  He was Denver's starting SG in that series and has played the majority of his minutes at SG.  &gt; Denver has 4 players on their roster that are an mvp and 3 legit should be/fringe all-stars.  You...have a weirdly excessive amount of hype about Denver's roster from that series.  But even if we stipulated the accuracy of that hype, how does that mean Dame was let down by his team?  Surely the conclusion should be that the other team was simply better from top to bottom.  &gt; Again in 18-19 we played Russ and PG and Steven Adams, heck Jerami Grant is better than any of our role players in the last 6 years. We started Enes Kanter. Multiple players that were on our roster from that season are not even in the NBA anymore.  Multiple players that were on OKC's roster from that season are not in the NBA anymore.  2019 Russ was not 2017 Russ.  Your assessment of the respective rosters doesn't match how they were actually playing.  However, Nurkic's absence certainly swings the argument here, and I'll concede that that's not a ""Blazers *should* have won"" series as I claimed.  &gt; You didn't see the physical toll that Dame endured to get us there.  And it sure is a good thing that when Dame's toll came due in the Nuggets series, there was a team around him.  While acknowledging that Portland has had bad roster construction for ages, I'm not sure what results you expected such that Dame's results are a historic letdown.  Dame is prodigious, an All-NBA talent...and more playoff teams than not are led by All-NBA talent.  How far is he 'supposed' to get?"
"Austin Rivers isn't even a shooting guard so, no? Point stands. Denver has 4 players on their roster that are an mvp and 3 legit should be/fringe all-stars. We had Dame, CJ...um Nurkic sometimes but not then, Old Carmelo, Normal Powell who seems to be a shell of what Toronto fans think he is?  Again in 18-19 we played Russ and PG and Steven Adams, heck Jerami Grant is better than any of our role players in the last 6 years. We started Enes Kanter. Multiple players that were on our roster from that season are not even in the NBA anymore. Your assessment of the 18-19 is flawed probably because you were too busy watching really good, fun, winning basketball while we ground our way to come see you in the WCF. You didn't see the physical toll that Dame endured to get us there."
"Jerami Grant? More like Jerami Can't  Kidding, good luck brother!"
"Well a) Grant would‚Äôve had more touches with Jamal out, and  b) it‚Äôs impossible to say whether they got better or not, they only played like 15 games together  I‚Äôm any case Jerami is clearly better than Gordon lol"
Probably asking Malone to run some plays for them once in a while too.  I get Jokic's the MVP but sometimes you gotta let other guys eat or they bounce like Jerami Grant did.
"The 10-72 Sixers had Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and Robert Covington"
"Hate this mentality. Preseason showed that he has new moves in his bag, but it may be a bumpy ride as he calibrates. The guy just turned 24, his development isn't anywhere near done.  Look at what Jerami Grant proved he was capable of once given the opportunity. You really don't think OG can match that kind of production?"
They had a good game against the Bulls. Jerami Grant went off
Process legend Jerami Grant
"Who is a better player, Tobias Harris or Jerami Grant? Is it clearly Jerami Grant?"
Cade has the most potential but right now I think jerami grant is our best player so we would be replacing grant at least that‚Äôs how I rationalized it
Yea sure sorry jerami grant
"Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, and Robert Covington are all guys off the top of my head developed by Brett Brown into good players and have gotten solid contracts to prove it.  Their improvement from g-league level players to starter level is way more impressive than Ben‚Äôs."
You said you‚Äôd trade both Jays for either Julius Randle or Siakam and that Jaylen is the biggest empty stats player in the league and you‚Äôd rather have Jerami Grant so I‚Äôm not surprised. Sad you haven‚Äôt gotten bored by now but not surprised.
"I'm going to throw a few bullshit names at you, and out of curiosity, (ignoring contracts), who would you 1-for-1 Ben for?  Colin Sexton  Brandon Ingram  CJ McCollum  Jerami Grant  Demar Derozan  Pascal Siakam  Jamal Murray  Malcom Brogdon  Domantas Sabonis  Chris Lavert  Fred Vanvleet  Kemba Walker"
"Yes, and Jerami Grant playing hero ball at the end of the game"
"Bulls fan but was impressed by some Pistons after this game:   **Jerami Grant**: WOW. This man needs to be considered a top-40 player. Detroit was starting a 2-way SG, had no Cade, and were struggling offensively until he picked up the slack. Solid rebounder, good mid-range, even a couple nice passes. Color me thoroughly impressed.    **Saddiq Bey**: looked like a bona fide starter. He used his size/strength with Beef Stew to bully the Bulls on the board. He kept exposing DeMar on D as well. Just overall impressed for a 22-yr old 2nd year player.    As a Bulls fan,  **Lavine**: Top-20 player and rising. Top-15 in my personal rankings.    **Caruso**: not a meme, immediately a top-3 defender on the Bulls   **Lonzo**: first real PG I‚Äôve seen on the Bulls since 2016. Our offense flows SO much better with a full-court initiator and all of these slashers. The Bulls just need consistent outside shooting and their offense makes a lot of sense."

I will always believe Lebron convinced Jerami Grant to leave the Nuggets
"&gt; We aren‚Äôt gonna be good but we kept it close with what should be a solid Bulls team in a game where Lavine popped off.  Seeing the Pistons play tonight is an eye opener for me. And this is without Cade Cunningham. Saddiq Bey is a contributor already. And I would say a future all-star. He's not some rookie anymore.   Saddiq Bey and Jerami Grant are going to carry the team. And we haven't seen Cade play with them yet. Pistons are a shooting guard away from being a playoff contender IMO. I can only think of Eric Gordon being most likely available. But of course, Pistons can do better.   I am not sleeping on this team."
Jerami Grant always seems to kill us lol. The game last year where he had 40+ was also insane sometimes the man is just unstoppable.
"The Pistons also didnt run any sets and forced Jerami into that position. Im not saying it wasnt his fault, but Im guessing Grant felt it was his job to win because thats the position he was put in."
Caruso definitely not ready for the mediocre competitive spirit of the central division of the eastern conference. We are talking airball Jerami Grant isos with less than a minute remaining. If you don‚Äôt understand that you don‚Äôt understand the rust belt. Local Detroit tv feed looking like 1980s pbs production quality. Announcers looking like a few strangers on CTV at a Chucky Cheese. Shit looking like it was shot on cameras made of graham crackers.

philly should trade ben simmons for jerami grant
Jerami Grant is the best player in the arena.
Never forget the bubble scrims where the Denver Nuggets starting 5 looked like this:   PG: 7'0 Joker SG: 6'8 Jerami Grant SF: 7'2 Bol Bol PF: 6'7 Paul Millsap  C: 6'11 Mason Plumlee
"Also Jerami Grant, it‚Äôs the 75th year!"
"I‚Äôd be interested in the Pistons.  After the most hyped offseason in recent Pistons memory, the mitten state finally has hope. Just maybe not for this season.  There‚Äôs a lot to look forward to this year outside of the win column. Cade‚Äôs debut (which will be dictated by his ankle) will be the Detroit sports event of the century. Hopefully the newly anointed 5‚Äô6 Cunningham will show the NBA world he‚Äôs a floor general on both ends and his year. Hopefully braids-Killian can prove the doubters wrong and stay healthy while improving the jumpshot. Killian definitely looked promising last year if people watched him. His vision and defense were at times remarkable for a rookie, we just need the consistency. Hopefully Stew will continue dominating the boards, and Bey will continue his ridiculous prowess from three.   Depth, defensive consistency, and shot creation are three obvious issues the Pistons will still have from last year. The win total won‚Äôt be pretty in all likelihood.  This Pistons young core is among the league‚Äôs most promising. And they have an incredible mentor in Jerami Grant. All we can ask for this year are flashes of the greatness we‚Äôre hoping for."
"2011-2012 lineup: Brandon Knight, Rodney Stuckey, Tayshaun Prince, Jason Maxiell, Greg Monroe  2021-2022 lineup: Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, Isaiah Stewart  One backcourt of the future vs. another backcourt of the future. All I know is I have a good feeling about Brandon Knight moving forward."
Jerami Grant was playing for the OKC the past season bud.
They had a bunch of tradable guys like Jerami Grant and Gary Harris who coulda been included.
I bet they wish they still had Jerami Grant and Christian Wood too
"could have accepted a package around Jerami Grant, who I‚Äôd honestly want on my team more than simmons. sixers had any choice of a package which included a young player but they said no waiting for a superstar"
"&gt; Why wouldn‚Äôt they if they have the space. You‚Äôre probably not getting a big name anyway so you might as well shoot your shot.  I don't know the answer to this question, but when was the last time a team signed another team's RFA to a max contract?  There's been a few non-maxes (Allen Crabbe comes to mind), and some instances where the original team matched (Otto Porter Jr., lol) but I don't think it's happened in the last five years at least.  If it's indeed never happened, I don't think anyone's gonna take that kind of bet and risk coming up empty.  Even the small market teams end up with free agents that they love and overpay for (Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward).  You can't do that if you're locked up for days 1 and 2 of FA."
"Pistons. They have Jerami Grant (MIP runner up) and Cade (#1 pick) plus a nice core of second year guys: Saddiq B3y, beef stew, Hayes, and Saben Lee"
"Dude I just replied to that 7 year old thread before seen the dates, lol. Here I was wondering why they used 2012 as a cutoff year.   2014 obviously has to be included because of Jokic:   Jokic, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jordan Clarkson."
"2014 2nd Round had Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
"Scoring rank in a season works better than ppg imo.   In 2004, the lowest scoring season since the 50‚Äôs, TMac had an otherworldly season, putting up 28 when nobody else put up more than 24.2.  Kobe (24 ppg), Dirk and Duncan (22 each), all between 25 and 28 years old, matched what vucevic, Jerami Grant and Siakam put up last year.    Top five scorers for multiple seasons are no joke, scoring titles aren‚Äôt either."
"He is better. AG's contract has slightly less in guarantees, but this is a great deal for the Suns. We overpaid AG because he would be a UFA and not an RFA next year like Bridges would, and I don't think we wanted a repeat of what happened with Jerami Grant."
This is not so. The Pistons broke up with Wood not the other way around.   My theory is that Troy Weaver was trying to push Blake Griffin's contract off the books by getting Denver to do a sign and trade for Jerami Grant and Plumlee and didn't want a quality center on the roster because it would hurt their chances of finishing with the worst record.
Beef stew with killian being inconsistent and cade needing time on his injury jerami Grant is our star and Stewart needs to be a super reliable center that can be a cornerstone long term

"Westbrook  Harden  Ibaka  Adams  \#35  &amp;#x200B;  There are other guys like PG, Melo, and Jerami Grant, but just about every Thunder fan would give you that all-time starting 5. Some of them may even name #35."
"Wildly uninformed statement. Crazy how people speak so confidently on stuff they clearly know so little about. See this story: https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/  Beyond that, for basketball purposes, he wanted to be the number one option. At best he was going to be the third option in Denver. In his first season in Detroit, he absolutely proved he could be a number one option. Guarantee you he becomes more efficient with more talent like Cade surrounding him this year as well"
"Is Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and Alex Caruso that much better than say Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, and the shell of Dwight Howard?  Richaun Holmes/Christian Wood definitely is better than Dwight Howard/Mike Scott, but the guard rotation of Green/Caruso and young guns Thybulle/Milton/Korkmaz/Maxey is substantially better than anything Hinkie put together and Tobias Harris for Jeremi Grant has to be called at worst a wash.  This is all bitching about the margins though. The point of the process was Simmons/Embiid (lets just pretend Jahil Okafor didn't happen), and at the end of the day the 76ers issues rests on the fact that that duo just doesn't seem to work together. And there is zero reason to assume Hinkie would have somehow magically ""fixed"" or resolved that.  The most generous you can offer is Hinkie would have traded Ben Simmons before it reached that point."
"*Jerami Grant for Ilyasova AND the first round pick that became Tyrese Maxey. A lot of Sixers fans [thought it was a decent deal at the time] (https://np.reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/5al2p9/the_76ers_have_traded_jerami_grant/) because Grant couldn‚Äôt shoot and was stuck behind other players.       I point this out because people act like the Process was infallible, like Hinkie did nothing wrong and Brand/Colangelo did everything wrong. So Hinkie would never have chosen Okafor but the organization made him, etc etc."
"&gt; treating 20yr olds as ""assets""  You really think RoCo, Jerami Grant and the like were mad about getting all the playing time they wouldn't have gotten elsewhere that ended up helping them become desirable players?  Hinkie is out of the league and never coming back, we'd have heard loads of stories from players if they all hated him."
"I feel like we've hit on a lot of non-lottery talent - Roco, Matisse, Maxey, Shake, Korkmaz, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, TJ McConnell to name a few. For the most part they all developed in Philly with probably the exception of Jerami Grant.   When it comes to Simmons, obviously the development is not what you'd want to see offensively. Fultz is a pretty unique case though."
"&gt; The hard part was turning all those picks into a winning team.  And this is the biggest thing.   1. In the process of Philadelphia trying to figure out how to win, they've had to tear down a lot of the infrastructure that Hinkie built up.    A lot of Hinkie's players had to be let go because they had no place on the team. We can talk about guys like Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood and Jerami Grant but they had no place to succeed in Philadelphia. They were PF/Cs on a team already overloaded with PF/Cs.   A lot of his coaches, trainers and medical staff also had to be let go.   2. We can't say the problems Post-Hinkie GMs had weren't going to avoided or solved by Hinkie, because Hinkie made very similar mistakes during his time.   Post-Hinkie Problems| Hinkie Problems ---|--- Brand and Colangelo spent all their key draft assets and cap space on non-shooting guards, PFs and Cs| Every single top pick Hinkie had he spent on non-shooting PGs, PFs and Cs The 76ers have had no spacing inside and have had no real answer to the constant double teams| He bragged about forcing double teams in the post and argued the case that drafting 3 consecutive top lottery bigs had put the 76ers in a good position The 76ers have only ever had 1 player who could create off the dribble at an elite level (the #1 skill in the modern NBA) and they lost him| He never once found a player who could create off the dribble at an elite level They've had huge issues with coaching and training staff |  Those staff were all Hinkie hires  Was Hinkie, the man of a million PFs/Cs, really going to save them from overloading on PFs and Cs?   Maybe Hinkie could have saved the franchise, or maybe Hinkie was just another David Griffin, good at running a team into the ground and not much else."
"the process worked great, but it ended with Hinkie resignation.   trading 22 year old Jerami Grant for Illysova was Colangelo's first real move as GM and it went downhill after that.    And yes, of course Philly would trade Ben for Jrue right now.   But we also wouldn't have had embiid."
Aaron Gordon for example. Will get 23m a year which is a bit too much but Barnes is making less and is a bit better imo. Can't really call Bojan a two way forward but he's making around what Barnes is making and i think Bojan is worth it. Jerami Grant obviously deserves 20m a year. I think 19m a year for Barnes is reasonable. There just aren't many two way forwards in the league.
Jerami Grant back to Denver. I'd love a starting five of Mal/Grant/MPJ/AG/Big Honey. Cutters and shooters flying around the Mall/Honey P&amp;R would be beautiful. They'd be giant and super athletic on D.

Jerami Grant for us
Just thinking about how Jerami Grant made Team USA over Randle
"Jerami Grant is just a slightly better Tobias Harris tho, idk why they‚Äôd play both of them together  The best trade is Mccollum without a doubt"
"&gt;  The Pistons would ‚Äúentertain‚Äù trading Jerami Grant for Simmons, the Sixers don‚Äôt seem interested in a Spurs package including Dejounte Murray and Lonnie Walker IV (which is fair enough), and the Kings aren‚Äôt discussing any deals that include either De‚ÄôAaron Fox or Tyrese Haliburton.  If those are still the deals on the table in December I don't think a trade is likely.  Grant is fine and on a fair deal but i'd rather wait for Ben to come around, at least until closer to the trade deadline."

"Lowry, Butler, Chauncey, Ben Wallace, Julius Randle, Jerami Grant, Paul Millsap   Bunch more."
Jerami Grant
"Dunno how far back you wanna go but Andre Roberson had super clean backdoor cuts with the Thunder.   Current players, I like watching Jerami Grant and Aaron Gordon when they cut."
"17-18 is when they had Paul George and Melo. They also had Jerami Grant, Roberson, and Steven Adams."
Robert Covington? Jerami Grant? Joel Embiid? Lol
"I still don't get what they did wrong. Embiid was obviously the right pick, even if they had to wait 2 years. Nerlens was considered to be a possible #1 pick if he hadn't torn his ACL. Jah was the consensus pick at #3 at the time. Trading MCW when his value was high was clearly the right move.         Are people upset that they didn't sign any high priced veterans like Joakim Noah and Luol Deng? You probably don't get Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell and etc if that happens."
"Nash is the nicest guy in the NBA. if i was the GM, and KD already signed that extension, im sending kyrie's ass packing to detroit for jerami grant"
"I would agree with that statement, he's more of a prime Andre igoudala or Ron arrest. A very good 3&amp;d player who's showing shot making ability  So similar to jerami grant. A good to fringe star player  Tho some rap fans are quite dreammy about him being the next kawhi for some reason"
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"Many players shoot 50% from 2. I‚Äôll use the lineup for the Pistons which were the worst team in the league last year.  Mason Plumlee: 63% 2pt / 0% 3pt  Jerami Grant: 47% 2pt / 35% 3pt  Saddiq Bey: 45% 2pt / 38% 3pt  Wayne Ellington: 52% 2pt/ 42% 3pt  Delon Wright: 52% 2pt/ 35% 3pt  Josh Jackson: 49% 2pt/ 30% 3pt  From the Pistons, we see that half the starting lineup shot 50% for 2 pointers. When you factor in drawing fouls, 50% 2 pointers is worth more than 33% 3 pointers as well."

"Jerami Grant also looks better, Olympics rlly boof your abilities"
"OKC trade - asked out because the team was going to tank and develop young talent and WB didn‚Äôt want to have to waste prime years for a rebuild. Carried OKC‚Äôs terrible rosters to the playoffs every year after KD left but it was obvious none of those rosters could make a deep run because the role players were either undeveloped pieces (Oladipo before his breakout season, Jerami Grant before he could shoot, etc.) or were bad/old and are no longer in the nba (Kyle Singler, Alex Abrines, Corey Brewer, Melo right before he went teamless). Had 2 seasons with PG when he was way more inconsistent after coming back from his injury. PG‚Äôs second season with OKC was good but the lack of a bench and both WB and PG choking in the post season meant that they never went far.  Rockets trade - arguably one of Russ‚Äôs most efficient seasons. Harden asked for Russ specifically and Russ was okay to be traded to Houston but wanted the Lakers as his first choice iirc. Carried the Rockets when Harden had his huge shooting slump in the second half of the regular season after ASB. Was putting up great numbers on good efficiency during that post ASB period. Got injured with a torn quad right before the playoffs, after which they rushed him back onto the court when the Rockets started losing games to OKC. Russ played terribly obviously and never once dunked/went to the rim hard during these games which was infuriating at the time; until it was revealed that he was still injured during those games. This season was weird because the Rockets didn‚Äôt have a center for almost all of the season because of the Capella injury and he never came back on the court with Russ before he was shipped of (which was the reason for the small ball experiment).  Lakers trade - Rockets again going through a rebuild like the OKC situation. Rockets had gutted their picks/assets for their ‚Äúwin now‚Äù season and needed to rebuild. Lebron also asked for Russ specifically.  WB has always been a net positive on every team he‚Äôs joined, except for the playoffs where he struggles due to the pace slowing down and defensive rotations/scheming becoming tighter. His play style focused on getting easy points off the chaos during the fast break or bullying smaller guards left alone on an island with him. Both disappear in playoff settings and his below average shooting gets taken advantage of if they can pressure him enough to shoot instead of pass."
"In no way, am I saying we have good roster construction. I'm mostly agreeing with you, but you're just a bit wrong on some situations/taking it too far. Dwight Powell is not an ok wing defender, he's pretty bad honestly. He also isn't very good at the PNR anymore because his athleticism has major declined. He takes quite a few terrible attempts at the rim too.   Completely agree there's not enough NBA starting caliber talent, but that doesn't mean Kleber/DFS/Bullock can't be valuable pieces. If the rest of the talent is there, all three of them can slide in as a starter. But the issue is having three of those guys without the talent around just pins everything onto one player. Kleber, like you said thought is 100% a 4. Our best lineup is when he plays PF and Porzingis plays Center, but I think the coaching staff wants to protect KP's health and limit his fouls by playing him at PF.   I also think you are imprinting a bit of Knicks KP's problem onto current KP. He has become a much better rebounder on the Mavs, and has been decent defensively. Agreed that his interior presence is very on and off though. Occasionally, there's just plays at the rim, where its like why did u have no impact. I also think he's much more willing to bump inside offensively than in the past.   There's just lot of teams that I think would love some of the guys on our team, but for us its just constructed poorly. I think Maxi would be great for Portland. Bullock was great for the Knicks last year. Dorian could play a Jerami-Grant type role for Denver. They aren't bad players, but they aren't talented. And they need someone to make plays for them at ALL TIMES."
Its honestly close  Jokic  Embiid  Clint Capela  Julius Randle  Jerami Grant  Marcus Smart  Jusef Nurkic  Zach Lavine  Could possibly make an argument for:  Dinwiddie  Bogdan  Jordan Clarkson
Jokic  Embiid  Clint Capela  Julius Randle  Jerami Grant  Marcus Smart  Jusef Nurkic  Possibly Aaron Gordon
"And a bench of McConnell, Shamet, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood"
"Grant wanted a bigger role with more usage. Nuggets wanted that role for MPJ so Jerami found a team that would give him what he wanted. Denver offered to match the deal but he said no.  Nuggets mismanaged that whole affair.  &gt; Jerami Grant on leaving Nuggets: ‚ÄúMy growth as a player is extremely important to me‚Äù &gt; In their sales pitch, the Nuggets vowed to work with Grant to help develop him as a player, a source said. It didn‚Äôt matter. After Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr., **the best the Nuggets could offer him was a fourth option in a budding offense**. They believed that was compelling enough, in addition to the opportunity to play for a title contender."
Sixers decided Jerami Grant wasn‚Äôt enough they ain‚Äôt doing Kembum
Yeah well unfortunately as you would have seen they can‚Äôt even sign Jerami Grant. They did want to keep him he just didn‚Äôt want to come back.
Jerami grant being the only person on this team who can actually score the basketball with any semblance of efficiency is starting to hurt my soul
"He's actually better than Grant this sub just don't watch the Pistons or Nuggets. He's a much better defender than JG, rebounds better, is a way better passer and facilitator, and is a slightly worse shooter than JG. Jerami since going to Detroit is averaging like 20ppg on 52%TS. That is abysmal. They both aren't meant to be THE guy, and are role players."
"&gt; You could hardly find a better 3rd player to put next to Jokic and Murray,   Uh Jerami Grant.  Jerami actually plays defense as well."
Sounds like jerami grant
Jerami grant wanted to go to Detroit. Nothing we could have done about that
People wanna give the Lakers shit for signing THT over Caruso but imagine giving MPJ max money while letting Jerami Grant go.

"Smart to keep him. Vanderbilt plays hard every time I see him. I like the size, length, athleticism, and physicality. He reminds me of young Jerami Grant on D."
I see you‚Äôre an OKC fan.. are you just basing off this from the time Jerami Grant still on OKC with Paul George and Nerlens Noel shutting Giannis down that one regular season game years ago? Because I can assure you Jerami Grant by his lonesome is not stopping Giannis or any top 10 player at all
"We got a huge lead in the 3Q, then got VERY complacent. It really isn't as close as the scoreboard indicates. We did 3 very shitty and repairable possessions (fouled the 3pt shooter, left jerami grant WIDE open, then let another straight open 2pt play when LeBron sat), which got the game closer than it was going to be"
"""Jerami Grant is a Giannis stopper!""  **Jerami Grant joins the Bucks**  ""wait stop..."""
"Giannis is averaging 22/9/5/1/1.6 on 52/37/69 with +91 against Jerami Grant in his entire career. Sure, his points are a little down but I'd say he is just as dominant."
And they still left him on the floor. Literally risking re-injury to avoid losing to Jerami Grant. Should've benched him as soon as he was clearly hurting
"I speak for those who had under 214.5, Jerami Grant can eat my whole asshole."

"Bruh second time I'm correcting a Sixers fan this week. You got him for the pick you recieved in the Grant to OKC trade.   The trade was Ersan Ilyasova and a conditional 2020 first round pick(conveys if in top 20, two future seconds otherwise) for Jerami Grant. The pick was attached(according to people not named Presti) because it was essentially a salary dump but Thunder benefitted big time by acquiring Grant.   Of course, we inevitably lost the asset game regarding this trade at the end, because we traded Grant for a pick to the Nuggets, in the same draft and ended up not only losing our pick because of an unforeseen playoff run that year, but also getting a worse pick from the Nuggets than we traded to Philly."
"They had Nerlens Noel, Robert Covington and Jerami Grant so yes probably. Also an unproven Richaun Holmes coming off the bench!"
This dude thinks Trae would provide more to Team USA than Keldon Johnson and Jerami Grant lmfao
I‚Äôd rather Collins or JJJ than Jerami Grant
to build my team around? man Detroit already doing that with Jerami Grant so no thanks
"Interesting post. I've been thinking along those lines. Can we just bring CJ on from the bench? I honestly think one of the biggest problems with the starting lineup is there are too many mouths to feed(okay..I know it can't realistically happen).   I'd love a starting lineup of Dame, Norm, Nas(Not saying he is starting quality right now but he is a way better fit as the on ball stopper this team needs with low touches), Cov, Nurk and bench lineup of CJ, Ant(as PG so that CJ doesn't blow up the offense isoing), Nance + whatever works for the night from Snell/Zeller/DSJ.  Re trade- from everything we have heard(podcasts with reporters etc), it seems like the team is primed for a trade to bring the wage below luxury tax. I'd happily swap CJ for 2 role players(Dorian Finney-Smith + Brunsen(too much??)? SlowMo + a good defensive playmaking guard to pair with Ant? Jerami Grant??) I'll take anything...I just can't watch this defense and ISO anymore  &amp;#x200B;  p.s I know CJ is a very very good player...just don't think he is a good fit for the Blazers"
Jerami Grant please
I'd like one Jerami Grant please
"I mean, it only takes one.   The concern about Wiggins as a max guy is that his efficiency has gone up because he's not creating on ball. I don't really like ""first option/second option/third option"" breakdowns, but Wiggins is a guy who can get you a lot of points if you've got other players creating seams for him to cut through, but you can't give him the ball and ask him to create a bucket against the set defense and expect good results.   So he's worth way more to the Warriors than he is to other teams. I think only a dumb team would line up to pay him more than $25m.   On the other hand, two teams were willing to pay Jerami Grant $20m, and I suspect most good teams would rather have Wiggins.   The problem is that if you're a good team with $25m+ in cap room, you're hunting bigger fish than Wiggins, and if you're a bad team, $25m+ for Wiggins is a bad way to spend your cap room. He'd be a great addition on, say, Dallas but it's hard to see how they get that kind of space for him."
Jerami grant leaving nuggets for pistons barely had any attention lol
I‚Äôve seen a few people compare him to Jerami Grant. Came into the league raw but figured things out and became a more efficient/effective scorer. I‚Äôm not sure he reaches Grant‚Äôs level but the comparison makes sense.
jerami grant gonna be an all star since his okc days
"THis year Aaron Gordon, last year MPJ, the year before that Jerami Grant"
&gt; Jerami Grant  in what universe are Lakers getting Jerami Grant LMAO are you high
"Holy fuck the disrespect lmao.  Siakam is literally coming back from injury, playing way out of position and is still putting up better numbers than Grant is this season. We're talking about the a guy that was the 2nd option on a championship as well as 2nd team all NBA vs a guy that was the 4th option coming off the bench the last time he was on a good team.   I love Jerami but he's literally shooting 40% from the field and 30% from the 3 this season, why is this a conversation."
Jerami Grant?
Siakam vs Jaylen  Siakam vs Randle  Siakam vs Tobias  Siakam vs...Jerami Grant?  Wonder what's next lol. Ya'll really obsessed with Siakam.
Jerami Grant

"Kawhi had 6-22 and 4-17 games, and was overall less efficient while averaging 5 points less, and doing so against Jerami Grant and will Barton while kd was playing Andre iguodala and Draymond green"

Brett Brown isn't the guy that's going to lead you to a championship, but he's one of the best at getting lower tier players to improve and play hard.  I'd argue that due to his unique experience coaching one of the worst teams of all time, he's one of the most qualified of this particular situation."

How much crack did you smoke today?  I feel bad for myself for reading both comments.  Come on now. Jerami Grant took the exact some contract from another team. Idk how the nuggets fucked that up. AG is a legit defender that's supposed to be the last option on offense. He's doing exactly what he's supposed to do. The fact that we're getting our asses beat missing 3 Max players  doesn't mean anything to anybody important. There's not a team in the league that wouldn't struggle with those circumstances.

This just isn't a scenario that comes up all that frequently, it's a narrative to paint bad scorers as bad players imo and that's just unfair. I'm not even sure it's a bad thing - if u miss your shot, it's absolutely a positive to grab the rebound."

"Trading Fultz got Philly a second rounder. IIRC the first was from the Jerami Grant trade. Irony of this is, we traded Grant the same year our pick was with Philly(top-20) and got the Nuggets pick in return for Grant. Philly got the pick that became Maxey and we got a pick that was used to trade up to 17 for a player who people seemingly hate for no reason. Like the 17th pick is supposed to fetch you an all star, or that the 17th pick in year 1 of a rebuild should necessarily be used on a player with a high floor/low ceiling. Lol"
"I don't particularly care about the Pistons, but I follow him on Twitter and make a point of reading his stuff. He wrote an article on Jerami Grant at about this time last year which is one of the best sports articles I've ever read. So, so good"
I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into that considering all of the effective offense for the Lakers came when the Pistons were playing 200 lbs Jerami Grant at Center.
Should have given that money to Jerami Grant instead?
Hopefully he gets suspended so we can get more of the greatness that is 200 lbs Jerami Grant playing Center.
"Isaiah just lost it and fired a 5 lb. plate at Lebron. He missed way high and hit veteran center Trey Lyles in the back of the head. He had no idea what hit him. Isaiah actually felt pretty bad about it; Jerami Grant thought it was hysterical. Lyles was out cold and we had no idea what to do. Corey [Joseph], Saddiq, and Josh Jackson carried him to a massage table and laid him face down so anyone who saw him would just think he was waiting to get a massage. I had about 20 or 25 extra headbands in my locker so I just started wrapping those around Trey‚Äôs head to try to stop the bleeding."
"And everyone knows that AD is one of the softest big men in the league who rode LeBron's coattails to his one (and most likely) only championship.  He was supposed to take the reigns from LeBron last season yet (as usual) was injured throughout the season and faded into the background. For God sakes LeBron was putting up better stats than him last year.  This season again he was expected to step up, is mostly healthy, and when LeBron sat he could barely beat the OKC thunder.  Meanwhile today he is screaming and talking shit like he took down Shaq when the guy mainly covering him was 6'7 Jerami Grant who looks like a twig in comparison"
"He randomly tried to shove Jerami Grant during the commotion then got into a Fatal Fury fighting stance, it was entertaining as fuck"
"Jerami Grant doesn't move the needle much IMO, I wouldn't want to give up any of the young guys (who Detroit would surely demand) for him.  The ceiling is still realistically the second round.  I'd play it out, see how far you can go and what you've got, and think about a trade in the offseason or next year."
"Aight but we all know Jerami Grant is capable of nights like this, and LAL had great defense in the 4th. Everyone, including Melo, was locking guys down."
Watch the clip with him in LeBron face jerami Grant and someone else literally held on his arms for dear life. He managed to get his arm which grant held up and was in motion for a punch before getting separated
What a heroic effort by the Lakers. The combined powers of AD and Westbrook managed to rally around Bron suckerslapping Stewart and overcame Jerami Grant and Diallo. Finals bound.
"The Pistons who are without both of their centers, and have had to play Trey Lyles and Jerami Grant at the 5 since Stewart got ejected."
I feel bad for Jerami Grant. He was on the Process Sixers and he's on the rebuilding Pistons. He's good enough to be a big contributor on a contender.
Jerami grant out here getting superstar calls. The biggest scrubs get all the calls against us and we can never buy a call
"every game someone on the other team goes off team is trash jerami grant just open every possession      I never want to hear that AD is a top 10 player again"
Is it me or is Jerami Grant kind of ignoring Cade in the flow of the offense?
"Yea, I can't say I blame him. Fuck around and find out. I think my favorite part is Jerami Grant holding down his right arm so he couldn't get it up to throw a punch."
"Serious question since I don't watch the Pistons:  I heard Jerami Grant was in a slump before this, is that true?"
Jerami Grant heard yall talkin shit.
"That's Jerami ""moo moo"" Grant for ya"
It's taken Ben Simmons more than 80 minutes to score his last 16 points. It took Jerami Grant just 2 to score the same amount. Grant heard all the Sixers fans trashing him the last two days.
westbrook should stay in detriot and we should kidnap jerami grant

They miss Jerami Grant and need another 3 and D guy
Could be Jerami Grant
"Jerami Grant if he continues this type of scoring would probably win it  Or Christian ""Why didn't the Pistons resign him?!"" Woods"
"Nuggets have shown that they're very content to develop guys from within the organization unless there's a perfect fit for the right price (like their trade for Jerami Grant).   They won't trade for the expiring Dipo unless it's a good deal for them, like Harris + Bol or something. And it all depends on how Dipo and the Nuggets players look over the next 2 months until the trade can actually happen."
"Blake still matches up well with KD, and with Jerami Grant performing at an MVP level, they should be fine. Even though they traded Thon Maker a while back, I still say Pistons in 5"
"Nah, Jerami Grant still better than the Net bigs 3 hands down"
He's not winning MIP. Bank on that. There's plenty of players with far better impact on the court (Jerami Grant and Shai are just a few examples).
The rise of Jerami Grant has been interesting ngl
Jerami grant is not a inside presence. He was playing small forward guarding wings like Kawhi the entire series. You don‚Äôt have a fucking clue what you guys are talking about. Clippers fans still gonna be blaming trez when the lakers when a chip with him playing 25 min a night.
Cos we played the same guy in Trezz but who‚Äôs way worse in all facets. They also had Jerami Grant who‚Äôs an inside presence.
"they lost many good defenders like Jerami Grant, Torrey Craig and Jamal Murray isn't that good. MPJ hasn't played yet."
"Yes, losing Jerami Grant really did mean that much."
Jerami Grant fits so well in this Houston team.
Turns out Jerami Grant was pretty good
"They lost Jerami Grant and replaced him with Michael Porter Jr. who has played bad defense other than his rebounding and missed over half the games. Millsap is 1 year older which doesn't help his defense. Barton is shooting much worse. Craig walked and they didn't really replace him. They lost Plumlee who is a good backup center despite the crap he got for his contract. Also they're only 5-6. That's really not that bad.  They're definitely a worse team than last year but they should still be expected to be in the playoffs, just hoping for home court."
"Bubble Jamaal didn‚Äôt translate consistently. They‚Äôre missing MPJ, they lost Jerami Grant.."
‚ÄòVery valuable player for every team to have‚Äô. I mean so is Jerami Grant lol KCP...Tristan Thompson...Pat Beverly .... most role players are very valuable! Lol
Jerami Grant for Defensive Player of the Year
Jerami Grant
you mean the pistons*    tough stepback 3 on jerami grant
Jerami grant
"&gt; Jerami Grant is more of a case of his usage increased.  Him maintaining, and actually improving his efficiency despite the much higher usage and volume is what makes his jump special"
"Jerami Grant is more of a case of his usage increased.  Grant has always been this good, but he never got the FGAs."
IMO Jerami Grant should be the front runner right now
"he definitely has improved quite a bit, but i say it's between christian wood or jerami grant atm"
"for every 100 Gordon Hawyard and Jerami Grant slander posts, there is 1 post where we get it dead on"
"They ended up with the worst record once and that article list equally as shitty teams spread throughout the league.      You can keep harping on that season, but it was caused by our point guard getting half injured so we didn‚Äôt replace him(Kendall Marshall) waiting for him to get right.  Plus Embiid was supposed to play   When he didn‚Äôt they tanked.    They played young players who now are thriving on other teams like Jerami Grant, RoCo, TJ, Nerlens and others who are still in the league like Ish, Jakarr, Okafor, MCW.     Everybody decent wanted long term deals back then.  Solid vets weren‚Äôt signing 1 year deals. They could have used washed up players and overpaid instead of young guys.  As a fan of the team I preferred the young guys."
"Jerami Grant is a fucking baller though, man bet on himself being able to carry the load and he is delivering so far"
"based only on games played so far, i‚Äôll go with   **EAST**   G1: Bradley Beal  G2: Zach Lavine  G3: Malcolm Brogdon  G4: Jaylen Brown  FC1: Joel Embiid  FC2: Giannis Antetokounmpo   FC3: Kevin Durant  FC4: Jayson Tatum  FC5: Domantas Sabonis  FC6: Khris Middleton  WC1: Julius Randle  WC2: Nikola Vucevic   **WEST**  G1: James Harden  G2: Stephen Curry  G3: Damian Lillard  G4: CJ McCollum  FC1: Nikola Jokic  FC2: LeBron James  FC3: Kawhi Leonard  FC4: Paul George  FC5: Anthony Davis   FC6: Brandon Ingram  WC1: Luka Doncic   WC2: DeMar DeRozan  honorable mentions for jerami grant, trae young, collin sexton, tobias harris, gordon hayward, bam adebayo, shai gilgeous-alexander, devin booker, and anyone i forgot"
Same.  Thank christ for Jerami Grant &amp; Christian Wood.
"Nah. Not a fans of both teams but if Nuggets need reinforcement, they need the kind of player that can help Jokic on defense. Like Jerami Grant last season."
Not a chance. His name is Jerami Grant
no because jerami grant is miles ahead every1 rn
"There's a Jerami Grant thread everyday, but where's the love for Hayward playing up to his contract."
"yes that's obvious, but the point is that even a minimum player such as torrey outplayed barton (in the '19 playoffs when it took the home crowd booing barton for 2 games for malone to bench him) and later undeservedly lost his spot to him   at the beginning of last year barton should have been behind grant and torrey in the rotation, but he ended up starting - i can't imagine that sat well with jerami, who was acquired in his contract year, just having played 33mpg in okc"
"yes, that's my point thank you - plenty of people showcase their abilities in denver, and malone plays barton regardless  beasley, torrey craig, jerami grant"
"if they weren't willing to pay 20m for grant, then they should never acquired him - i think anyone that watches the nba could have told you that he would get at least that  but by all accounts they seem to have offered him the same money detroit did, so it seems like you are misinformed  jerami most likely left because he didn't enjoy playing 25mpg off the bench behind will barton in his contract year"
"nuggs got rid of him, and later jerami grant, because they were cutting into will barton's minutes..."
"Don't worry man, im also in an 8 team league and chose al horford over jerami grant in the 6th round"
"I still feel bad for Denver honestly.  The dude wanted more playing time though and if he continues to prove himself in Detroit then he'll get an even bigger bag on his next contract. Dude's looking out for himself at the end of the day, I get it.  Big-brain take: Detroit still sucks hard and they'll fade for Cade, who they can then pair with Jerami Grant and have excellent wing depth."
Do we need to start considering Jerami Grant a star now?
Jerami Grant can't be the top option on a good team. This shouldn't be controversial.
Still can‚Äôt believe Jerami Grant was on our fantasy waivers and I didn‚Äôt pick him up wtf
Jerami Grant is so good.
"He‚Äôs legit incredible. Obviously, people are still going to mention the absence of Jerami Grant(and rightfully so, dude is balling) but Green has far exceeded expectations and deserves credit as well"

"Thunder fan here who loved Jerami Grant during his time here, I don‚Äôt think this is entirely true. He‚Äôs been a good player his entire career outshined by other star players on the Thunder and Nuggets. There‚Äôs a reason Detroit gave him the bag and it wasn‚Äôt far fetched at all that he was gonna feast on a mediocre line up."
I reckon it‚Äôs the loss of Jerami Grant that is hitting the Nuggets hard.
If people who are actually good like Zach Lavine and Brad Beal are missing out on all star selections there's no way Jerami Grant gets selected either
Jerami Grant is the first woman
Jerami Grant   Devonte' Graham
"Jerami Grant is doing a great job, but it seems to be like he's not suited to be the number 1 option on a competitive team. He's definitely proving to be a much better player than people thought he was though."
"I feel like Jerami Grant got tired of being a role player and told his agent I dont care how bad they are, just find me a team I can take 20 shots a game on. And to his credit it hasn't hurt his efficiency at all so far."
Jerami grant is making history as the first woman to ever play in the nba
https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/
https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent  It was actually part of his decision. As well as the touches and minutes.
Bro there‚Äôs an entire [Atlantic Article](https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/) about it.
"I mean I would say its more my views on what impacts a team winning. Only way to defend this point is to give a legitimate post and discussion, though I know these are better received on r/nba discussion.  Siakam's offensive game is a little individualistic for me. He's asked to create often, but does it mainly from these post-ups that he's just not very consistent with yet. He can make passes thought doesnt look to use his athleticism to create for others. To me, I can see MOST of his impact on the box score. He's still a very good defender which people often forgot when he wasn't playing well offensively in the playoffs.  On the other hand, Draymond instantly makes those around him better, particularly defensively. Golden State all of a sudden started playing much better defense as soon as he was on the floor. In basketball, the back line of the defense sees everything and to have a player as smart as him out there to coordinate all the players helps the teams defense drastically. Siakam improves defense on 1 guy, Draymond improves the defense on 5 guys.  On the offensive end, Draymond has clearly regressed, but people don't give enough credit to some of what Draymond can do. I am unsure if he's still able to do this (this season will tell more) But in 2019 against Portland, he was exceptionally smart running the fast break. He was often pushing the ball but while understanding where everyone else was. In transition, he's genuinely a point guard and does a great job finding trailers and setting up threes. He's not only a playmaker in the half court. I also think all his skills become more important in the playoffs, whereas Siakam's shortcomings end up hindering him more.  Toronto is a team with people like Lowry and Van Vleet. If this is still close to prime Lowry on this team, I would rather have Draymond on that roster because i think he makes both of those guys waaaay better. Lowry has a second creator, and he would be able to set great screens and find these guys for better shots. Right now, the Raptors offense has a lot of tough shots that Van Vleet is forced to take (though he's doing great with). I think that would get much better with Draymond. The team lost a smart, defensive IQ player to lead the defense in Gasol and I think it will show.  Again, its closer than you think and I understand valuing Siakam more, especially when the Raptors may feel they need that scorer. but I just think most of what Draymond and lots of players in this league do gets underappreciated. Denver will be a worse team since they will be playing MPJ instead of Jerami Grant. Chris Paul will be the most impactful player on the Suns even just averaging 13 points. Josh Richardson has made the Mavs starting lineup so much better. It's just not all about points for me."
"Jerami Grant as the number option works as well as anyone could've hoped.  The fact that Blake Griffin looks like a zombie and that the rest of the roster is horrible is why the team is losing.  Not that I think Grant is that great, and yeah he's not a first option on a good team, but the Pistons losing is like 0% on him, especially because even defensively he's clearly one of the 2/3 best defenders on the team and guards a lot of tough assignements.  20+ PPG on average efficiency + good defense is nothing to sneeze at"
i feel like we're gonna be saying shout out jerami grant a lot for betting on himself this year   if mike is just gonna be confident like this.. and bojan can get back to what he was last season.. jazz kinda sorta spooky
"Is the offense bad because Jerami Grant is our leading scorer, or is the offense bad because our other offensive options are Blake Griffin who can't move and rookies ?  It's not to say Jerami Grant SHOULD be the first option on a good team, just that our offense being awful has way more to do with basically everybody else sucking"
I see why Jerami Grant wanted a bigger offensive role. He‚Äôs doin it at every level this year
"Goes to show how big of a role, jerami grant played"
"And the offence is not good. If Jerami Grant is your leading scorer, your offence is going to be horrific."
They really need Jerami Grant and Mason Plumpee back. Losing key role players like that takes you out of contention.
"I do respect the pistons. Don‚Äôt think they will be my favourite, but jerami grant is awesome."
"It's because they let Plumlee leave without signing another 5. They barely play Bol Bol and don't have another big to fill in that spot. There bench has been great for the past few seasons and Plumlee was part of the reason why, this offseason though they let go Plumlee, and Torrey Craig, in addition to Jerami Grant, wifhout filling in those spots. I hope they can bounce back."
Jerami Grant is sorely missed
Now they're saying it's the Jerami Grant Most Improved Player Award
Jerami grant pretty soon
He‚Äôll have to get past Jerami Grant.
Don't forget sabonis and Jerami grant. That was low-key a stacked roster
Someone is maxing him to whatever they can. If Jerami Grant can get paid then so will Bridges. Suns will have to match.
Jerami Grant and Christian Wood currently both fit the unofficial criteria/precedent as the fringe starter/role player that blossoms to become all-star calibre in an expanded role.
"Jerami Grant damn near averaging 25, but that TS% is unreal. Pistons losing a lot but our roster looks like a bunch of misfits tbh"
Jerami Grant is the MIP. Not up for discussion
"&gt; But Troy Weaver‚Äôs run as GM has left me concerned for our rebuild   Man, he's been GM for 6 months. Cut him some slack.   You seem very entitled about success for a fan who hasn't seen a playoff win in over a decade.   There's no way that Kilian's injury could've been predicted, you can't put that on the front office, and you neglect to mention that Bey &amp; Stewart have been great picks so far.   Granted, I don't understand the reasoning behind the Wood moves. Maybe someone smarter than me can explain.   He nailed the Jerami Grant FA signing though.    Give it time, man. You'll feel better when we get new uniforms from Big Sean, too :-)"
"Last season had a lot of players make it for the first time, it seems unlikely to have a bunch more again  But actually projecting, not just based on season so far  West:   Projected: None  Contenders: CJ McCollum, Zion, Murray, Wood  CJ has been playing really well, but I'm not highly confident that at 29 he'll suddenly maintain the kind of shooting he's had so far. Zion has been playing well, but will need to be even better to have a chance, especially with Ingram on his team. Murray has also been playing really well, but guards have a lot of competition and I'm just not sure if it's enough, especially with another better all-star player on his team. Wood has the numbers, and if Harden leaves he has a good chance, but if he's still there I wouldn't bet on it   East:   Projected: Jaylen Brown, Malcolm Brogdon  Jaylen is playing fantastically, and without Kemba I think he'll get a lot of credit. Brogdon is also playing very well on the new Pacers, who are also playing very well. Jaylen is a much more clear pick than Brogdon  Contenders: Julius Randle, Zach Lavine, Jerami Grant  I think all three (especially Randle) are playing above their weight at the moment, the Knicks won't maintain anything like the 6th seed, and the Pistons suck. But it is the east and there seem like clear spots to be won, and they all have great 3 number splits so I could easily see at least one of them getting a spot"
I‚Äôm also positive the process Sixers ran this lineup in their darkest days   PG: Jakarr Sampson 6‚Äô7  SG: Hollis Thompson 6‚Äô8  SF: Jerami Grant: 6‚Äô9  PF: Jahlil Okafor 6‚Äô11  C: Nerlens Noel 6‚Äô11  406 inches
"Jerami Grant, to get that one out of the way. A shoo in at this point"
Dude I just saw Ish Smith drop 9 against the heat.   But seriously Jerami Grant is nice. Add is RoCo and Christian Wood and they probably pull it off.
"Jerami Grant, Mikal Bridges are his main competition"
Yeah. Jerami Grant taking all the shots he wants and scoring 30 in Detroit is what put me on to it. Obviously these guys have all been the #1 option at some point if they‚Äôre in the league
"you want a high volume guy period, like Harden, Curry, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Levert because of the consistent high floor of stats they provide  then some guys pick role players based on what categories they want to dominate or punt(purposely ignore to keep team strong in other categories)  if you want to dominate points, rebounds, blocks, and fg% then teams load up on bigs, usually at the expense of assists, 3pt%/3PTM, FT%"
"As a Cuse fan who watched him in college play zone every play basically, Jerami Grant is an absolute monster of a weak side shot blocker in a zone."
They missing Jerami Grant
"yeh but he clearly wanted to be an option on the offensive end as well, while it was pretty clear Nuggets wanted MPJ to be that 3rd guy.   Grant obviously worked hard on his offensive game and he wanted to show-case that, and Detroit gave him that opportunity.   Like its obviously a tough decision from Denver's standpoint, but they simply couldn't/didn't give him a role he preferred.   In the end, I think it was more a loss for Denver than Jerami bcuz they needed him more than he needed them"

Oubre and a pick for Jerami Grant?

I stan jerami grant now
&gt; It's annoying because they easily get free agents and meanwhile guys like Jerami Grant want to leave us since Denver isn't a free agent destination.  ???  How did you figure that Jerami left due to an undesirable FA market in Denver...when he signed with Detroit???
&gt;guys like jerami grant want to leave us   To historical free agent destination Detroit! Damn big markets!
Who is front runner for MIP between Christian Wood &amp; Jerami Grant?
Randle? Jerami Grant?
You're not watching the game lol  And I don't have to explain the Steph vs Jerami Grant all star campaign lol
Jerami Grant is ready to blow us out.
"jerami grant beat marcus smart on the break once i think, but he gathered the ball to dunk instead of laying it up and that small thing allowed the defender to recover and beat his shit. just an example."
"Please try to actually read. Nowhere in my comment did I say that KAT was top 25. All I said was that right now Jimmy isn‚Äôt. There are tons of players who deserve to be on the list over him rn, e.g Jerami Grant or Christian Wood. Idrc how many downvotes I get. It‚Äôs just that rn, Jimmy isn‚Äôt top 25 and anyone who seriously thinks that is jumping on the finals bandwagon from last year"

"For anyone curious this is what is expected, at the moment it is expected for Cedi to be at the 4, yes.   *Yes.*  And SexLand is expected to start but I'm not even gonna express excitement for the come back this time, because each time I expressed excitement I saw the lineup be changed right after haha  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (8-9) | [](/DET)Pistons (4-13) ---|---   D.

"Lu Dort  Hear me out before downvoting. He's definitely a great contract value but I see as many or more posts/highlights for him than guys like Victor Oladipo, Kristaps Porzingis, Nikola Vucevic, Jerami Grant, Brandon Ingram, KAT, DeAndre Ayton, De'Aaron Fox, etc."
Jerami Grant is way more than just a role player  Mike Conley isn't washed  Luka plays D and has a mid range game  Jaylen Brown and Tatum might be 1A and 1B  John Wall is still pretty good  SEXLAND
"Agreed. Even with the proper amount of games played, it‚Äôs clear that up-and-coming wings like Jaylen Brown and Jerami Grant have surpassed him as All Stars.  James Harden &amp; KD coming East also means even less spots for guards and forwards on the periphery of the East All Star team."
Wonder if Jerami Grant is available
Jerami Grant.   Dlo/Beasley/Okogie/Grant/Towns.  That's a fucking good lineup right there.  Great offense and enough defense to actually build leads with it.

"I might be in the minority, but I‚Äôve thought Russ‚Äô MVP has always been overrated.   His usage was historically high that year and looking back, he had players like jerami grant, mcdermott, oladipo, and sabonis on that team that year along with roberson and adams.   Of course they wouldn‚Äôt be the players they are today back then, but it makes you wonder how great that team could have been if WB‚Äôs usage wasn‚Äôt so high and those players were involved more."

Of course not lol. By this logic Pistons are the best team in the league lmao. Detroit &gt; Phoenix &gt; Utah &gt; Warriors &gt; Lakers. Jerami Grant Finals MVP.
So someone like Jerami Grant with better defense and the ability to rim run?
The Nuggets should play MPJ at the 3 spot and get an athletic rim running PF that can defend and shoot the 3. Someone like Jerami Grant
And jerami grant pls ignore our record üòÖ
Ben had Jerami Grant in jail
Jerami Grant is like the quintessential type of player that Ben Simmons excels at locking up
"Jerami Grant going 3-19, 2-8 from deep is just brutal."
Jerami grant and galinari got 20 million. He‚Äôs getting at least 20 million.
Jerami Grant disagrees with you.
Process legend Jerami Grant. Happy as hell that he's come on so strong for the Pistons.
"It's great to see but man it has to be somehow weird for OKC fans to see Grant and now Dort develop from the ""pure athete who defends"" to really good 3&amp;d options (more than that Jerami now) which was bacially THE thing they needed for all the KD/Russ years."
"Jerami Grant walked, really fucked our plans up"
"as much as Jokic is obviously a far more versatile offensive player, Nuggets are still struggling with roster construction (largely due to Jerami Grant leaving). They need a true elite defensive PF to make sure to cover for Jokic's deficiencies on that end.  Now Giannis obviously whilst being an elite defensive player, can still give you the offensive production of a #1 option despite being limited as a jump shooter.  Which is why I'd give the edge to Giannis, even though Jokic is having a phenomenal year so far and he deserves full credit for that."
Sexton Dort Jerami Grant &amp; Christian Wood
Casey is looking awful in Detroit. They're playing directionless basketball and he's entirely dependent on the creativity of players like derrick rose and jerami Grant to make something happen in his mediocre system.  His defensive principles are also dated and I can see why they got destroyed whenever they were faced against a player with great court vision.
"If I had to be the GM of a team, the Wolves would be my last choice. The roster just seems so difficult to work with. Figuring out how to mitigate KAT's defense, having DLo on a max, a bunch of role players that don't fit well.  Honestly, I'd just keep tanking for 2 more years and hope you get a hit. The only way they can improve the team significantly right now is by giving up assets.  If not, I'd try to pull off a Jerami Grant - DLo trade, maybe giving up Culver and some seconds. DLo and Grant's trade values are kind of hard to gauge right now. DLo and KAT is just never going to be a good fit. DLo needs a team to cover his defensive vulnerabilities and the Wolves are... Not equipped to do that. You can make Rubio start. I highly doubt he's cooked at age 30, just having a rough streak. Offer 2 seconds for PJ Tucker.  Rubio Beasley Grant Tucker KAT looks a lot better."
*and Jerami Grant
And Jerami Grant looks great doing it. Win-Win

It's probably Christian Wood tbh at this point but Boucher is definitely a top 3 candidate along with Jerami Grant. I think Boucher can win 6th man if he keeps coming off the bench.
"MPJ was borderline unplayable at times because of his defense. Jerami Grant deserved all of his minutes. Losing Grant right as he blossomed into a 20+ ppg guy is really rough, his versatility on defense alone would have denver as a top seed right now."
"Theres this guy in Detroit I have my eye on. His name is Jerami Grant. I think he would do great on the nuggets, and fill a lot of needs for us"
I agree he kinda reminds me of a smaller jerami grant from last year:)
Jerami Grant
Are we forgetting Jerami Grant and Christian Wood or...
Jerami Grant turned down equal money to play for the 3-11 Pistons
"How come nobody is giving Denver FO shit for letting Jerami Grant and Torrey Craig go? Where's that ""letting a washed Trevor Ariza go"" energy."
"Westbrook carrying without Durant hits different than Jokic carrying without... Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee.  Westbrook also made averaging a triple-double seem almost normal, so it won't be as big a deal if Jokic does it this year."
They have 8m before they come up against the apron. They could make a play for pj tucker. He fits well with the jerami grant trade exception
I‚Äôm starting to think that losing jerami grant was a huge deal for the nuggets
"I knew we'd be very bad, definite bottom 3.  Sad to see Killian hurt.  Glad to see our other rookies, Saddiq Bey and Isiah Stewart, look like solid picks so far. And Jerami Grant in balling.  Coaching is fine but you'll always get complaints from fans that we're overplaying mediocre nba vets too many minutes. The time will come in the doldrums of the season where the young guys are let out to run wild so who cares if we play Wayne Ellington 30 minutes a night for the first 2 months if it allows our young guys to safely adjust to the physicality and grind of the NBA, especially this season."

"and Jerami Grant stats are inflated.  he has all the green light on offense, of course his numbers goes up."
Jerami Grant
I think he‚Äôs on the Grant Line. Harris had similar success to Jerami Grant when he was with Detroit. And Harris could also be a key role player for a contender (like he is right now with the Sixers).
"I like this, thank you! I think this is pretty spot on for the NFL. Or at least it was when Dalton was in his prime with Cincy.   Is ‚Äúthe Grant Line‚Äù more catchy than ‚Äúthe Jerami Grant Line‚Äù?"
"Westbrook had the twin narratives of ""carrying OKC without Durant"" and ""first guy to average a trip-dub since Oscar.""   Jokic has.... ""carried DEN without Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee""?"
"Jerami Grant deserves a fuckin shout out man, this dude is putting up almost double his career high in PPG and his shooting splits are essentially identical to the past two seasons. The Pistons might be pretty terrible but Jerami deserved that pay day."
My man Jerami Grant with the 59.5%. So close!
"Only sub 6'10 guy in the top 20 in the league too.  Other than Wiggins all of the top 20 are Cs with like 4 Pfs sprinkled in (Durant, AD, 2 others I think).  Next sub 6""10 on the blocks list seems to be Jerami Grant at 22nd."
"Plainly untrue.  Among league leaders in contested shots and opponent shooting % on contested shots for a non big (2nd).  11th in blocks per game and the only under 6'10 non C/PF player in the top 20. the Next player sub 6'10 on the list in Jerami Grant at 22nd.  Also watch the games, just last night DD wanted nothing to do with the ball when Wiggins was guarding him and that is saying something because Demar can usually post up dudes his own size and a little bigger due to his strength."
anyhow the moral of the story is that if you can't tell that jerami grant is a better basketball player than will barton then you have no business coaching a basketball team (or commenting about the sport on the internet really)
"Zach Lavine, Jerami Grant and a couple others are also better."
Jerami Grant is the pick though
"well all of those players were doodoo-tier players before thibs got there, and some still are but he's found some way to limit the amount of damage they do   kevin knox was an abomination of a basketball player last year, but now thibs shackles him to the corner and he can stay on the court  randle been around the block too and no one else has really gotten him to be an impactful player   look at the other team nepotism coach, mike malone, also unable to define any roles for his players, has will barton and gary harris out there putting up unseemly efficiency numbers, barton near bottom of the league in just about every advanced stat 2/3 last years and led the team in minutes last year, forcing jerami grant to move elsewhere for reasonable minutes"
Man me too. I‚Äôve been really rooting for them this season too since they got jerami grant
Jerami Grant has taken an insane leap
Jerami Grant is worth his contract
If the Raps turn it around I'd give 6th man to Boucher  MIP has to go to Jerami Grant or Christian Wood though
But by that same token you would undervalue a lot of other process Sixers. RoCo and Jerami Grant didn't look like the players they are now after their rookie year. If these guys were drafted high there was a large sample size that gives reason for that. You need to wait at least two years before you dump these guys in the garbage and label them as busts.
Gotta throw jerami Grant in there as well imo
"Chris Boucher.  Lu Dort offense  I already knew Jerami Grant, Christian Wood and Wiggins would be this good tbh."
"Picked him up with my last pick in fantasy, not disappointed. Him and jerami grant are carrying me lol"
I would think Christian Wood or Jerami Grant is MIP favorite atm.
"I would‚Äôve said Jerami Grant if he would‚Äôve stayed in DEN...  However, I‚Äôd say Duncan Robinson. He literally has one job, and it‚Äôs pretty hard to stop him from doing that regardless what you throw at him. Definition of a role player right there."
"Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Lu Dort are all front runners IMHO so far, but we‚Äôll see how if they can keep it up."
"I think Jerami Grant is the MIP favorite so far, he's increased his averages by 13 points, 3 rebounds and an assist as well as steals and blocks being up"
Either Jerami Grant or Chris Boucher will be MIP but Lu is up there in the conversation.
Jerami Grant is looking like the favorite for Most Improved Player.
"Jerami Grant (didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd handle the higher usage)  Julius Randle (I think last year was just a down year because he looked really good in Nola, but Impressed with his consistency so far and decision making)  Blake Griffin (surprisingly terrible, the heat game tells it all)   KD (didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd still be this good I can‚Äôt lie lmao)   DeAndre Hunter (he‚Äôs gotten comfortable and looks like a legit high level 2-way (not just 3 and D) piece for the hawks)   DeAndre Ayton ( I really though he would look All-NBA caliber this year, haven‚Äôt given up hope at all though he‚Äôs still good)"
"Jerami Grant, dude looks like a legit two way star wing"
Jerami Grant. He's been amazing
"What did Joe Harris get in free agency?  What about FVV?  What about Kemba Walker?  What about Hayward?  What about Jerami Grant?  He‚Äôs getting a big contract nephew.  Celtics should try to get vucevic, but they won‚Äôt do it."
"lol so he can play defense and shoot no one knows if he's good enough to be a starter or what he could do with starter minutes. he could literally be a sabonis type player that is on nobody's radar and finally gets minutes and a system to thrive.  once again, you are looking at things from a negative scope here. he could be more than a role player but no one really knows. he's going to get paid like a role player. Maybe he really is a role player from what they see in practice, or maybe he's actually Jerami Grant and might have a bit more in the tank.   Like he's getting treated a little worse than the rest of the league. Yes it isn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things and he's a millionaire but there's always a chance he could actually be a player to show more or take another step and achieve more greatness and likely being tossed around early could very much change his developmental status which could've been on a different trajectory with starter minutes or a tanking team."
"I wouldn‚Äôt say Jerami Grant is much improved, he is doing what he was doing in Denver, just with more minutes and a starter/much higher usage role"
"I would go with Wood. Also, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like the MIP race is between Christian Wood and Jerami Grant right now. Grant is killing it despite the fact that the Pistons have been bad."
"funny thing is if you look back that roster doesnt look nearly as bad as they actually played that year. lot of guys who ended up getting way better after they left that team. granted some of them were young/raw players like sabonis, but there were some pretty solid players on that team like oladipo, sabonis, jerami grant, adams, doug mcdermott. i've seen worse rosters make the playoffs"
"no you can't. not effectively anyway. And regardless, that has nothing to do with my argument, which is that being a 25ppg #1 option is better *for Jerami Grant specifically*"
Jerami Grant has just as much of a case imo
"Disrespectful to Steph, specifically. Scrub teams don't have MVP-caliber players. The *Pistons,* sure, I have no problem calling them a scrub team, even if Jerami Grant looks really good."
"Darius Garland,  Jordan Clarkson,  Jerami Grant,  Christian Wood,  Chris Boucher."
Heat were down 19 twice in the first quarter and KZ was having trouble guarding Jerami Grant.
"Yeah, based solely on what we‚Äôve seen so far, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs between Boucher, Wood, and Jerami Grant rn."
Someone need to start Jerami Grant MIP campaign
Miami avoiding Jerami Grant smh
I thought it was silly that Jerami Grant wanted to go somewhere to be a primary option and not play third wheel behind Murray / Jokic. I was wrong.  Jaylen and Jayson are special  Fultz before his injury was great to see  Sabonis continues to be a beast
Jerami Grant used to this shit to us when he played for OKC every time I'd watch so I'm glad he's actually been doing it on a game to game basis looking like a borderline star player.
"Oubre, Covington, Ayton have been disappointing   Jaylen, CJ, Jerami Grant and Julius Randle have been better than expected"
They need a wing defender. A Jerami Grant type player.
"And they made it a sign and trade, buddy  https://www.nba.com/news/report-jerami-grant-agrees-to-big-deal-with-pistons"
Man I miss Jerami Grant
Who is younger than Jerami Grant and is doing pretty well in his new oppurtunity with the Warriors...lol
Everyone remember Jerami Grant is 26.....Some players need time and opportunity ! and then some are andrew wiggins
"I think Randle, SGA, Sexton are improved but where at a similar level last season.  Jerami grant went from 12ppg to 23-24, nobody saw that coming.  Dort would be another strong candidate, but Grant just made a ridiculous leap."
"Just don‚Äôt say the same thing about Jerami Grant, damnit! Lol"
"Lets me 100% honest here, Jerami Grant was never going to have a fucking legacy.  Say he stays in Denver and they win, ""oh you mean the guy who played with Joker, Jamal and Porter Jr?""  and I bet most people would answer ""you talking about Gary Harris?"""

Jerami Grant is the MIP and I don't think it's close.
Doesnt jerami grant have MIP locked up
"He has a better shot at the MIP than 6th man in my opinion.    Look at it historically, Bocuher would need to be getting a lot more shots to get the 17-20 PPG he'd need to pull down the MIP, but if he start getting starting minutes he might get to 13-14 shots and might get up to 18 PPG which puts him in the discussion.  The Blocks will help and might get him some traction but Jerami Grant is putting up 23 PPG right now on 18 shots.  He's running away with it.   Christian Wood also has a good shot, but he's been injured, so if he doesn't play 40+ games, he might not get it.  Some people have Jaylen Brown in the mix, but I don't see them giving the award to someone who went from 20 to 25 PPG.  I think Bocuher comes in 3rd unless both Wood and Grant come back down to earth or miss too many games."
"Give it to Jerami Grant imo, GOAT"
Jerami Grant
They‚Äôre a Jerami grant away
Did you just say Zach is a lock???  Jerami Grant is still the frontrunner
I still think Jerami Grant is more the type of improvement the award is geared towards rewarding.
Who ever said jerami grant is overpaid? Didn't denver offer him the same contract? I though he chose detroit for a bigger role on offense not a bigger bag.
Jerami Grant...
"Tbh I didn‚Äôt remember that Jerami Grant was a second round pick. I thought he was just out of the lottery, don‚Äôt know why. It seems like few people think the way you do. I agree, draft a player who is athletic and skilled if you can. It doesn‚Äôt have to be one or the other all the time. I just am not a fan when people who can‚Äôt shoot are drafted, that‚Äôs like a baseline thing that basketball players should be good at imo. People are giving me a lot of crap but it‚Äôs just a preference."
Sometime it‚Äôs not what the team asks them to do. Look at jerami grant. In Denver his role was more of being a 3-D guy. Now in Detroit they don‚Äôt have as much offensive so he is asked to be more of a creator.
"They have lol. At least about some parts, for example Jerami Grant. But was it really so outrageous to wait for more than a 10game sample?  I don't know man, they just create daily content, it's not all that serious. But I also don't want to defend these dudes Idon't care enough tbh. They are often wrong, as are many others"
"I feel a large part of being unable to create your own offense can be part of the system and role you have in place. for example if you look at someone like jerami grant who's played a similar role his whole career suddenly averaging 24 and looking like a very good offensive player, I feel anunoby could potentially do similar with an opportunity like that"
"Pistons are experiencing this too. I've never once heard them admit that they may be wrong about the Pistons off-season (which admittedly we all thought was wacky, but has really been a smash success) and anytime they talk about like Jerami Grant it's always ""well, I expect those shooting/scoring numbers to come down."" Dude, just admit you're wrong. It's cool. We didn't see either at all. It's okay to be wrong sometimes."
"I mean LeBron lost to the Pistons and then almost lost to the Pistons. So, I think it's fair fo conclude Jerami Grant for MVP"
"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_totals.html      Click on 3 points made.  Dame is #2 to Curry #1, sure.  But it isn't that close.  The difference between them is more than the difference between Dame and Jerami Grant, for example.  Dame is a great great player, but Curry is no questions about it the greatest shooter ever."
I can‚Äôt believe you would double down on this hilariously bad take. if you have the choice between a guy like TJ who has a very low floor and a mediocre ceiling vs Jerami Grant who has a very low flow and an all star caliber ceiling why would you be mad at using a second round pick to take a shot on someone who has all of the natural gifts to be great and work on developing him. Does the idea of practicing and learning also piss you off? That argument about TJ is just honestly weird
"Bro he was drafted in the second round and has turned into a star player. Even if he didn't have the leap to stardom this year and plateaued at where he was last year, that's fantastic for a guy picked 39th overall. How tf was he a bust? I think he's a great representation of the nba, a plate who's raw with potential, and has refined his game to be the guy on his team  Jerami Grant is a phenomenal player, exactly the kind of guy you want to draft in the late first/early second round. Dumbass take"
"I strongly dislike Jerami Grant and what he represents for the NBA. I remember him coming out of college and to be honest my opinion is that he sucked. Not a good basketball player, but a great athlete. I thought he should have stayed in college and developed his game but everyone wants to go to the NBA as a raw athlete and develop there. So what you have is this weird 6 year bust of a player who finally figured out how to be a basketball player and it weirdly frustrates me. If a guy takes that long to develop, he isn‚Äôt worth drafting. /rant"
Looks like it‚Äôs gonna be Jerami Grant
Dame GTJ Middleton Jerami Grant Bam
Dame/Jaylen Brown/Jerami Grant/Simmons/Turner  George Hill/Gary Trent/Ingles/Mason Plumlee
"Dame  Marcus Smart  Jerami Grant  RoCo  Bam   Bench: Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, Joe Ingles, Royce O Neale, Richaun Holmes"
"Murray is great but they lost Jerami Grant, Plumlee and Torrey Craig.  Murray played at an all-time level of greatness in the playoffs last year and they still barely beat the Jazz by a buzzer beater.  Grant/Craig/Plumlee leave big holes in their roster that Murray+Jokic going super saiyan again isn't enough to fill, they need other guys to step up.  Fortunately they have 60% of a season to figure out their chemistry issues so I'm not counting them out yet."
"I love stories like this,  In an interview with Jerami Grant on the Lowe Post Podcast, Grant talked about how much he enjoyed ""The Boys"" comic book series and didn't really have any interest in the show.  He also mentions how he likes to travel solo around the world and said India was his favorite trip so far"
"I don't think he is a lock at all. He definitely should be, but I am worried he isn't going to make it. Lets just say Adebayo, Tatum, and Middleton get the front court spots. That leaves two backcourt spots plus two wild card spots up for grabs for Harden, Jaylen Brown, Simmons, Randle, Hayward, Trae, Vucevic, Sabonis, Jerami Grant, and Lavine. I think Harden and Jaylen Brown are pretty much locks.  Im going to be pissed if Lavine doesn't get in because I love his game (and 29/5/5 on 65 TS% is ridiculous), but I just have a bad feeling that those last two spots go to Randle, Hayward, Trae, or Simmons"
"Give us Jerami Grant then, you can have tank commander whataburger"
"While Lamelo and Haliburton are clear favorites, I think PatWill is slept on in terms of his contributions as a two-way player. He might not be a primary ballhandler like those guys, but instead he might have a similar career trajectory to OG Anunoby or Jerami Grant in terms of positionless role player turning into potential star. He's the youngest player in NBA right now looking like a grown man. I think he's going to be that player who emerges in his 3rd or 4th season - just like Bam, Sabonis, and other stars have once they get more opportunity."
Jerami Grant &gt;
Jerami Grant and Trae
The fact that more players voted for Jerami Grant than Randle and Sabonis is embarrassing
"I don‚Äôt think think he‚Äôs anywhere close to front running for Most Improved. He‚Äôs only up like 4 points, 1 reb and 2 assists.  Jerami Grant is up 11ppg 2reb and 2 assists Christain Wood is up 9ppg and 4rpg  The only accolade Randle can get this season is All-Star, I don‚Äôt see an All-NBA Team or Most Improved in the cards for him."
Yea they switched it to Jerami Grant
"That‚Äôs mainly because of Jerami Grant, Paul Millsap, and Gary Harris all being very good for them last year defensively."
Jerami Grant $$$.  He turned down $13M/year this past offseason already
"Jerami Grant is not a really good defensive 4 though.  Definitely a solid player on that end of the court, but not the difference-maker that the Nuggets really need."
Hmm. Maybe someone like Jerami Grant
"I mean Tony Delk and Corey Brewer dropped 50 back in the day, and Andre Miller when he was like 45 years old. Grant is atleast the focal point of his teams offense, those guys were 3rd or 4th options or even bench players. Scoring is obviously at one of its high points right now, but Jerami Grant dropping 40 isn't anything crazy or any sort of indicator that the game is too easy"
"Game is too easy now. You can't play defense, of course everyone looks like an all time great. Jerami Grant dropping 40 easily... Jesus."
Imagine starting Paul Milsap over jerami grant
"I feel like you only qualify as a ""rebuilding team"" when you have pieces and a plan to execute for your future, which y'all don't. An overpaid washed Blake, Jerami Grant getting a bag, and a couple young pieces aren't going to cut it. Y'all didn't trade for Blake to rebuild lol. Y'all are a captain less boat."
"Nice! I especially liked the second half of the large comeback, the part when my favorite team was heavily outscoring their opponent.  Shout out to Jerami Grant (43 points) and Zach LaVine (37 points)"
Jerami Grant puts the ball in the net.
Nash Rip Klay Jerami Grant Howard
&gt;Used to be a big feat now we got Jerami Grant scoring in the mid 20s.  get the fuck outta here with trying to disparage Grant's year...
Ok bro. No one could score on ok efficient on a fucking 8-20 Pistons team except for Jerami Grant because he‚Äôs so wonderful.
"I believe if Andrew Wiggins, Tyler Herro, OG Anunoby, Terry Rozier were given the same situation that Grant has been given in Detroit, they would do similar. Those 4 are not even sniffing all-nba talent. Jerami Grant is not that fucking efficient lmao he shoots 44% from the field and 39% from 3. It‚Äôs ok."
"I haven‚Äôt watched any Pistons games, how is Jerami Grant getting buckets like this lol?"
that description fits Jerami Grant well lol
To DET for Jerami Grant? üëÄ
"Malone hurts us, Green is not Jerami Grant and nobody is really improving to help out Jokic. This is what happens when you trade your quality role players for scraps instead of building a really good trade package for a star player.  I think we'll still make the playoffs and Jokic is absolutely amazing this year, but we need to stop being complacent and try to go get another star. The fact of the matter is, we probably have to trade Jamal to get it done since he and Jokic are about half of our cap for the next few years"
Losing jerami grant and plumlee.  Their replacement is bad.  Murray regress so much ( although still got some hope with the flash of Bubble murray in some rare match )   The other not stepping up except jokic
"Prime Rose, Blake, Jerami Grant, Josh Jackson, rookie Jahlil Okafor, Mason Plumlee, Wayne Ellington. The Pistons would go from the worst team in the East to a playoff team, but I don't think they would have been title contenders."
Don‚Äôt shit talk jerami grant. dude is balling dropped 43 tonight
[Athletic is paywalled but here you go bro](https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/)
No lol. Harden is literally an mvp caliber player. Jerami grant is a borderline all star
U watch ur mouth about jerami grant he is the real fuckin deal 40 piece tonight. If u watched games u would see
"Nuggets lost Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, and Torrey Craig, three of their best bench defensive pieces. That'll hurt you."
"Imo no.   - Miami has dealt with a crazy amount of injuries  - Kemba was still good last regular season even pre bubble, and wasn‚Äôt in and out of the line up as often. Brown and Tatum have both missed time  - Denver lost a key piece to their defence in Jerami Grant and they‚Äôre suffering for it"
&gt; Jerami Grant is good man.
"Well, when Jerami Grant left my team I know that I didn‚Äôt show up in threads after he had a good game just to inform people that actually he isn‚Äôt a winning player and display my bitterness that he left my team. I guess that makes me the weird one in your mind?"
"That‚Äôs revisionist, nobody laughed at that money. Everybody thought it was a steal for Jerami Grant after that playoff performance."
Fuck you Jerami Grant gets fucking buckets he doesn‚Äôt even go to the free throw line that much
Atleast im not out here personally insulting people because they don‚Äôt share the same opinion about Jerami Grant and the Pistons
https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/
"Because the bulls were so bad so no one ever watched. We had the worst coach I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. I hope Jerami Grant doesn‚Äôt start to get the same criticism as an empty stats guy, cuz he‚Äôs a dog too."
Jerami Grant is a star in the making. I'm glad to see him take on a bigger role finally.
"Fucking huge win, but I never want to watch jerami grant play against the bulls again."
"What a game. Jerami Grant is a beast and those last few sequences were intense. I swear, with our luck, that shot was going in and this was going to overtime. lol"
Jerami Grant has reached his potential   Man we are fun
I don't want to sound like an old man or anything but I remember when 140 points used to be only attainable in overtime. Now half the box scores are in the upper 120s.  Same goes for 25 ppg. Used to be a big feat now we got Jerami Grant scoring in the mid 20s.  Could be due to these circumstances but I'm not liking the trend.
"Jerami Grant can‚Äôt miss, we can‚Äôt keep leaving someone wide open"
Jerami Grant is a star
Zach Lavine vs Jerami Grant was the matchup I never knew I needed
Wtf Jerami Grant  This man had this in his bag all this time?
LMFAOOOOO  &amp;#x200B;  that's that no Gary Harris no Jerami Grant or Torrey Craig defense... this front office is doing a great job
Jerami Grant is a baaaaaaaaaad maaaaaaan
&gt; brown and wood are having big years.  Brown is averaging 6 points a game lmfao. You know whose having a great year? Jerami Grant
" He is 1.8 ahead of 2nd place. Going down that much again are at 44th - 47th place with Clint Capela,  Jerami Grant, Gordon Haywood, and Royce O Neal."
"The only people saying we're missing Jerami Grant are the people that don't watch nuggets games. His defence was always overrated. I thought I was imagining this but i remember in 2019 off season Zach Lowe said the same thing. He gives off the long armed good wing defender vibe, but people can blow by him and he's not a lockdown defender. What are people saying about his defence on Detroit now? (genuinely asking). All I hear is his ppg, which he had no chance of developing into as the 3rd/4th option here.    You don't understand how much worse and more inconsistent (missing games) our teams have been this year. Mpj and Green combining for 1/15 yesterday, Jamal with 9 turnovers... It felt like a joke. Jokic scores 27 in first half. Then when he's on bench 2 point game becomes 12 point game."
"Yeah. We still have Jerami Grant, Prince, Stackhouse, and Drummond on the backend of the rotation. We could matchup with them defensively and beat them on offense."
"Right - Wesley Matthews would not start for the Lakers.  A shocking number of people here were saying this back in November, and I tried to tell them otherwise.  He's their worst player by a significant margin.  Right - I didn't think Jerami Grant was as-good as he seems to be, but I thought he was very important to Denver and they would struggle after not really replacing him.  Especially with Millsap being nearly as old as James.  Wrong - I thought the East in general would be way better than it seems to be.  Wrong - I thought Miami would be one of the top teams in the East.  Even considering their missed games, they should not be as bad as they've been."
Right: Dallas would struggle this season. Everyone was predicting them to be a top seed in the west and Luka was gonna win MVP. No disrespect to them but I don‚Äôt see how people thought they were gonna be better than what they were last year.   Wrong: I thought Jerami Grant would be the definition of an empty stats guy this season but he‚Äôs proved me wrong thankfully. I hope dude makes the all star team this year he‚Äôs been balling. (He probably won‚Äôt make it but he definitely should win MIP)
Almost like a jerami grant type player
"Losing Jerami Grant seems to have made a huge difference. I'm not a Nuggets fan and don't watch many of their games, but they don't seem to be able to score consistently enough outside of Jokic doing literal god's work."
"Right: Gordon Hayward, Christian Wood, Lamelo Ball being good at some point  Wrong: Jerami Grant, Lamelo Ball not being the worst player in the league in his first season"
I think Jerami grant is more than an important role player and Denver definitely is hurting a lot from losing him. During the offseason there were a lot of people saying him getting 15m would be a overpay I found that funny. Jerami seems to be underrated.
"They are really missing Jerami Grant.  I still maintain that he was quietly one of the most important players in last year's playoff run, and he's proving what he's capable of in Detroit now.  He brought a tenacious energy to the floor that's completely missing from the team right now."
They had Jerami Grant and pissed him away.
Jerami Grant is way too good to just be labeled a 3&amp;D role player lol
Tell that to jerami grant
Jerami grant is my mip rn
"Lakers- AD has injuries  Nuggets- Lost Jerami Grant, their wing defence gone down drastically.  Heat- Entire team's momentum was stunted by Covid protocols.  Celtics- They're playing like ass, blame Ainge."
And jerami grant
Very unlikely. He‚Äôs already had a similar statistical season to this in New Orleans.  2018/19 - 21.4/8.7/3.1 on 60 TS%  2020/21 - 22.4/11.1/5.6 on 57.5 TS%  Noticeable uptick in assists and rebounds but not big enough a jump to beat Jerami Grant.
"And like a bank, they might not know what to do with the money.  The challenge with getting all this draft capital is you only have so many roster spots. Look at the tanking Sixers and all the talent that passed through their doors and walked: TJ McConnell (leads the league in steals per game right now), Richaun Holmes (14/9/2 on SAC right now). Jerami Grant (23PPG right now, at least they got Ilyasova and Maxey for him). Glenn Robinson (traded for some 2nds last year by GSW). JaVale McGee (3 rings since).   If don't consolidate those picks, they're going to have to let a lot of talent walk"
I could literally counter that argument by saying stats can help you if you‚Äôre on a bad team ... we‚Äôre not comparing Jerami Grant to Paul George even though they have similar stats
"Did you miss the part where I conceded that AG could be the 4th option? It doesn't really matter, hierarchy within the offense wasn't a sticking point of my argument. My point is don't shoehorn AG into being a Jerami Grant replacement, he has a broader skillset and will be used in more ways. Him and MPJ aren't jockeying for position within the offense, they both have their own ways to contribute.  Forgive me for using the phrase ""3rd option"" because clearly people have latched onto it and interpreted it as a slight against MPJ."
jerami grant was a great player for them but never a good fit
lmao I obviously don't think the Nugs are No 2 in the west without MPJ. But I see your point that Gordon could technically be a 4th option behind MPJ. I don't see the need to distinguish as I think they are both studs and you have a legit big 4 in the making. Also I'm of the mind that Gordon is more than just a Jerami Grant replacement. I think he's going to exceed expectations.
and? jerami grant was better
" I know, but there‚Äôs not much difference.  An eye test as well, especially when he played in the second team when he could take on a bigger role.

"Definitely is. Defensively I'm not willing to make that assesment yet, but Jerami Grant honestly had a lot of problems that people tend to ignore. Absolutely atrocious rebounding for a forward, that was so bad that we would end up losing on boards in so many games despite how good everyone on our team was at rebounding otherwise. Despite Grant's seemingly decent scoring stats, he actually never really contributed to the offense outside of being a decent efficiency shot taker. All ball movement stopped with him, so he really only got passed the ball when it happened to be a good shot. But at the same time his offball movement was extremely lacking, so often times we just had a guy standing around who couldn't be ignored by the defense and could make the easy shots, but really did nothing to create opportunities for himself or others. Even if Gordons defense isn't quite at the same level, I would much rather have a guy who's a dangerous cutter and can act as another vector for ball movement than Jerami Grant, when we have a superstar who is a top 3 passer in the league. We have plenty of players who can hit shots, we need more movement and another threat in the paint to create more opportunities for those guys."
I think people were skeptical because they lost Jerami Grant and Mason Plumdog in the offseason and didn't find any suitable replacements until now
"36.6% from 3, only Paul George (38.6%) and Jerami Grant (39.2%) shot better for us."
"You can say AG had a good game without saying ""and seems an even better fit than [Jerami] Grant was"" which is absolutely ridiculous to say after 1 game."
"He is, its clear Jerami is thriving in DET bc he gets a lot more usage, some guys need to have the ball to get going. Grant still did excellent fitting in with what we asked.  But we designed that 4 spot for a young Paul Millsaps game, and we got injured/elder Paul. Gordon does the off ball stuff a bit better than Jerami, and plays more like Paul but with the athleticism intact."
"At the time Jerami Grant leaving felt like a true systemic shock that hurt this season and the future. And now it feels like the best thing that could‚Äôve happened because Aaron Gordon is what people that didn‚Äôt watch the Nuggets thought Grant was, a top notch defender."
Basically Jerami Grant replacement with more athleticism and better facilitation (relative to Grant last year)
He should be a better version of Jerami Grant.
"This is the proper take honestly. On the 7SOL Suns, Nash, Amar'e and Joe Johnson were all freakin' awesome, and then Shawn Marion was in his own right the glue that held it all together. That's what Gordon can be and he can do it much more aptly than Jerami Grant ever did due to his rebounding ability, passing, cutting, and strength against bigger guys. Like, Grant was good but it's like the whole NBA community forgets LeBron just bulldozing straight over him multiple times in the WCF with his shoulders. Gordon is strong enough that that should be much less of an issue."
"Fits the Nuggets perfectly. Pretty much replaces Jerami Grant. With the improvement of Jokic and MPJ, I think the Nuggets are better now than they were in the bubble."
"People in this thread forgetting they lost Gary Harris AND Jerami Grant... Aaron Gordon can't replace both of them right? Yeah maybe Gordon is a better defender than Harris but losing Grant is huge too, Harris/Grant defended PG/Kawhi and now you're gonna have to pick only one of them to put Gordon on   I think this matchup could really go either way, people are underrating the Clips a bit and also underrating how much the loss of Grant AND Harris is gonna matter come playoff time"
nah when they dictate how many superstars end up on one team. Meanwhile Detroit doesnt even had a representative besides Jerami Grant.
jerami grant next question
I‚Äôll try for our team:  ‚Ä¢ Jerami Grant ‚Ä¢ Mason Plumlee ‚Ä¢ Saddiq Bey ‚Ä¢ Isaiah Stewart ‚Ä¢ Wayne Ellington ‚Ä¢ Dennis Smith Jr. ‚Ä¢ Saben Lee ‚Ä¢ Josh Jackson ‚Ä¢ Frank Jackson ‚Ä¢ Rodney Mcgruder
Detroit? No one thought Jerami Grant would get $20 million a year.
"I see everyone is sleeping on the Pistons.  Troy Weaver is assembling a gritty, hard-nosed team of Detroit-style youngsters who will all break out at the same time.  Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee, Hamadou Diallo, Sekou Doumboya, Jerami Grant, and a likely top 3 pick who could be Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, or Mobley."
"Sixers never sat guys like Horford or SGA.  Brett Brown Developed guys like Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, Nerlens Noel etc."
They did develop a lot of their players to be NBA players though. They just didn‚Äôt have the superstar to build around.   TJ McConnell  Jakar Sampson   Richaun Holmes   TImothy Lu Cabborot   Robert Covington  Jerami Grant   Christian Wood   And those are just the late Undrafted players lol
"Pistons get a top 3 seed and draft a stud (Cade, Suggs, Green, or Mobley) and their young core Stud, Killian, Bey, Stewart, Saben Lee, Jerami Grant shock into the playoffs next year and sign a top free agent, draft well again and are contenders within 2-3 years."
"The process was 3 years and the worst of those years gave opportunities to a lot of guys who wouldn‚Äôt have made it otherwise. That 10 win team featured TJ McConnell, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Jakarr Sampson, Nerlens Noel, Robert Covington, Richaun Holmes who have all signed second contracts and established themselves in this league"
I mean we still have Jerami Grant. And these rookies we have are all too good to be in G league. Bey is shooting 40% from 3 on decent volume and Stewart isy the second coming of Ben Wallace
"It‚Äôs never guaranteed my guy lol.  We expected jerami grant to re-sign with us after we traded for his expiring deal. He took the same money to go play in Detroit.  You make trades based on guarantees, not assumptions. You can swing for some upside assumptions, but for the asking price Lowry was going for, you really handicap your long-term assets and flexibility if you miss on that."
"Pistons, Mason Plumlee and Jerami Grant going to the promised land."
I think we swindled Cleveland. It allowed us to get Jerami Grant with cap space in Free Agency and start our rebuild while Drummond would‚Äôve picked up his $28m option and continued to be a low effort bum.
"Sign and trades are pretty rare, and when they happen they don't net much in return. Only 3 happened last offseason (which is more than usual).  Boston sent Hayward and 2 2nd rounders for 1 2nd rounder from Charlotte  Hawks got Gallinari for a 2025 protected second round pick  Pistons got Jerami Grant for cash considerations"
"It's mostly development. Most of the guys on your list come out of college  a dime a dozen.  There are so many 6'6 3 point shooters in college right now, but Joe Harris could fit any system and there was no way to know that.  There are so many ultra-athletic 6'8 guys in college that you don't know their true position - Jerami Grant developed the skill to go with the athleticism.  Jordan Clarkson - a non-flashy, mistake-free PG in college became a non-flashy, mistake-free combo guard in the NBA who could get a super hot hand. But it also took him a while to land in a situation where his talents were the best fit.  Jokic - he's just a unicorn. No one saw that coming and no one could have."
Jerami Grant was a very average college player.
For pure entertainment? Facu Dort Jerami Grant Giannis Jokic
"number 27 for the Sixers is kind of interesting  https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400828119  Harden dropped 50 because of course he did  Sixers played against Dwight Howard and Corey üÖ±Ô∏èrewer  You‚Äôll recognize several OG processors such as RoCo, Jerami Grant, and Regular Jah.   Sixers DNP - coaches decision? Some guy named ‚ÄúChristian Wood‚Äù"
Jerami Grant would be nasty on pretty much any team lol
Jerami grant
Jerami Grant would be nasty with Indy
"Not trying to sound like a homer, but I think Suns are slightly better due to their bench. Jokic and Murray are a helluva players, but they can't do it alone. They lost some key players from last year, most notably Jerami Grant."
There are almost none but that‚Äôs why Jerami Grant was such a huge loss for Denver. He was that dude for them.
Well the suns didn‚Äôt have cp3 before this season so obviously their core hasn‚Äôt made a conf finals. Also losing jerami grant made the nuggets a much worse team.
Wow the jerami grant disrespect
Minnesota pick is interesting. If I were them I‚Äôd wait until the lottery for the 60% chance the pick conveys since that‚Äôs when its trade value will be highest. If Minnesota gets to keep it then its value will be less but still valuable since it becomes unprotected for 2022. They can probably make a decent package around wiseman + the pick plus Wiggins + 2 more picks for someone like Beal if he becomes available. Or Lavine. Or a slightly smaller package for Jerami Grant. Or for vucevic
"to be fair, we'd probably be 0-38 without Jerami Grant"
Jerami Grant please üôèüèæ
"I remember seeing a few years ago that he is one of the best lebron defenders in the league due to his athleticism and size. He‚Äôs not as good of a defender as jerami grant in terms of lateral quickness, but I think he is definitely a better matchup guarding lebron due to his size."
"Theis and the TimeLord are a perfectly fine big man duo. TT a sieve on defense who isn‚Äôt quite athletic enough to be superswitchy or big enough to stop opposing C‚Äôs. Most fans would rather Grant Williams be our third string center at this point, maybe get a big body on a minimum contract. No interest in paying TT $10 million next year.   C‚Äôs actual need is playable wing depth. Hence interest in Harrison Barnes, Aaron Gordon, Jerami Grant, etc. We‚Äôd rather Semi not need to play 15 minutes in a close playoff game (although his shooting is being underrated by our fans right now)"
"Every front office meeting begins with Rafael Stone jabbing his finger at a whiteboard with ""WHO IS THE NEXT JERAMI GRANT???"" written at the top, with ""idk who knows someone at denver"" the only other writing on the board"
they could but didnt they already throw their picks at Jerami Grant? They would have to choose either 1 and use the trade exception
Jerami Grant  Julius Randle
"Blake's calculus is doing what Rondo did, he plays well in the playoffs, he's getting another deal, atop whatever he's making plus isn't miserable playing for a Pistons team that wants all his playing time to go to Jerami Grant."
"&gt; minus Jerami Grant because he's been healthy on a terrible team which would screw up my numbers  If data points don't support the conclusion, get rid of the data points"
"If Jerami Grant can be a #1, he probably believes he can be too."
He sees Jerami Grant and probably wants to do the same thing but he's nowhere near the offensive player of Grant's caliber.  Defensively he's better and as a passer he is but if he couldn't be that guy in Orlando when we desperately need that guy idk what he thinks gonna happen in Detroit without Vuc to play off of.
"As a Nuggets fan, I've BEEN wanting this to happen as has many of our fans.  Had our eyes on him as a potential Jerami Grant replacement.  I'm allll about it."
Jerami Grant seems like the clear winner and he‚Äôs basically an OKC product so that‚Äôs a fine outcome for me
Jerami grant and Torrey Craig were guarding him. Both good defenders
"8-9 with Wood, 3-17 without him.   Magic are 6-2 with Fultz, 7-24 without him.    Kings are 15-19 with Richaun Holmes, 0-4 without him.  Pacers are 16-18 with Mcconnell, 1-2 without him.  Blazers are 22-14 with Covington, 0-2 without him.  That's 67-61 with process trusters and 11-49 without them, minus Jerami Grant because he's been healthy on a terrible team which would screw up my numbers.  Hinkie is my Lord and Savior."
Jerami grant
"Good point, but I'm not trying to insinuate what Grant is doing is racist. I'm not American by the way, so of course I can't claim to fully empathize with the position of a black American. But it seems wrong to me to make this white/black/whatever distinction, you guys are all American. I find that the real issue that divides people is your background (economic), rather than race. At least that's how it is where I live. Jerami Grant is the son of an NBA player who spent 11 years in the league, and who has made many millions over his career. To be exact, adjusting for inflation, his father has nearly made 40 million dollars in the NBA. Jerami Grant has never been through the struggles of poverty that is seen in Detroit, or all these almost stereotypical struggles that is talked about. Jerami Grant has lived a more privileged life than 99% of white people in the country. His struggles do not compare to that of the typical black person, or even black NBA player.  My point is that while I think I understand Grant's perspective, I think it's misplaced. I think at the very least, expressing your preference to play with a black coach with black players is unnecessary. Because with the same logic, do white people not go through struggles too? What prevents them from saying they just have a better connection and feel more comfortable playing in a city of white people?"
Yea but currently the Nuggets have a worse defence if you take Jokic out. That shouldn‚Äôt be the case. They need to focus on getting good defenders cuz Jokic + Murray already make their offence elite. Losing Jerami Grant was a big blow but I‚Äôm sure they can find a replacement soon enough
"Wanting to play for a black coach in a black city and have an impact there. Yes. I bet jerami grant is going to do great things in the community and playing for a black coach is empowering when its a white dominated profession. If you read his full quote its pretty explanatory but of course you didnt do that because the second people like you saw him mention being black youre alarm bells went off.      Nobody wants to live in the past, but when the past was so damaging that it created a massive imbalance in society and racism that still persists to this day, then no its just not as simple as ""the past is the past get over it"""
"&gt;does that mean Simmons doesn't always match up with the opposing teams best player?  1) The league is far too switch-happy for *anyone* to guard the opposing teams best player 100% of the time. It's simply not reality. ISO possessions are a minority in the NBA and are decreasing YOY (I think)  2) Strength of Schedule I imagine plays a part in this - even if you have 2 players who have guard the opposing teams best player the same amount of the time, there's a big difference between that being Lebron James and Jerami Grant depending on how many times X team has played the Lakers vs played the Pistons.  3) It could very easily be a 72.9% vs 72.7% - remember this is just an ordinal ranking"

Jerami Grant basically ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Or 2016-18 Gary harris üòî
Add Jrue Holiday and Jerami Grant to the Nets lineup and it‚Äôs a fucking wrap.
That‚Äôs his biggest downfall. No Jerami Grant there anymore to do some dirty work. My biggest criticism of Jokic is his lack of rim protection. It‚Äôs the one thing that prevents him from being a contender for top 3 player in my eyes.
Players need opportunity and touches in order to develop. There are only so many shots to go around in a game. Christian Wood and Jerami Grant would have been low usage roleplayers playing behind Simmons and Embiid as opposed to the fringe all stars they are now.
&gt; btw that 1st in the Jerami Grant trade almost definitely became Tyrese Maxcy.  God bless Mike Muscala
Want to trace it back further? OKC got the pick that became Serge Ibaka by taking on a couple years of Kurt Thomas' contract from Phoenix.  btw that 1st in the Jerami Grant trade almost definitely became Tyrese Maxcy.
"Yeah Jay Z ain't it haha, but he kinda owns it I guess. I think Cedi, RoCo, and Jerami Grant are low key some relatively unappreciated fine men in the league. I also think Chris Paul is nothing special so I dunno, maybe I have weird taste."
Imagine if the okafor and fultz picks were used on just average players that fit the team... imagine if we didn‚Äôt bleed out all the talent we unearthed during the process years (trading jerami grant away for half a season of ersan ilyasova... fucking kill me). it‚Äôs definitely the sixers
"kyle lowry/jerami grant/lonzo ball/harrison barnes are the best players that could be traded. Barnes could net two picks maybe more depending on what is being returned. Lowry is probably the hardest guy to gauge, but a couple firsts would probably be in order. Ball probably gets trade for a young piece + picks if pelicans don't plan on re-signing him. Grant probably nets a couple picks + salary filler."
I would say best case is jerami grant if they pony up a bunch of firsts.  Most likely is Harrison Barnes or Celtics doing nothing
And Jerami Grant empty offensive stats on a horrible team and solid defense is enough to surpass what Sabonis has done the last 2 years?
"I won't do it. Jerami Grant chose to be in Detroit. Unless he wants to be somewhere else, I wouldn't trade him."
"I did not write them in order, but if you‚Äôre asking me, yes, I believe Jerami Grant is a better player than Domantas Sabonis but it‚Äôs close."
Jerami Grant
Im guessing this might be in relation to jerami grant rumors getting moved to boston?
Those picks could be anything.  They could even be another Jerami Grant!
"Jeremi grant is in the first year of 3yr 60m contract, 26yrs old. Jrue Holiday is in the last yr of a 5 yr 126m contract age 31. He will be looking for more than that with his next contract. Jrue holiday has been a better in the past, but given the contract situation and the age I would much rather have Jerami Grant."
"Because a team that has been bad for a very long time just chose them over a contender (and is young enough that you can build around him for a few years, and will probably improve over the next few years), and if you trade him away against his will and send him to the exact situation that he wanted to get away from, no player will want to sign with you  You're not going to trade that for a couple late firsts from a team who has only missed the playoffs once in the last 14 years (including this year). Even if Boston offered 4 picks, it's fairly likely that none of them are as good as Jerami Grant is this year. If not likely, then at least well within the realm of possibilities. This isn't 2k, you don't trade good talent for a chance at a late first"
"Wait a second, they're saying now that they'll personally suck Troy Weavers meat for Jerami Grant."
For most players it's been normalized. Nobody had a problem with Trez leaving the Clippers for example. Or Jerami Grant leaving the Nuggets.
I would bet every dollar I have that Danny Ainge‚Äôs cheap ass definitely did not offer ‚Äúmultiple first rounders‚Äù and definitely not 3 for Jerami Grant. He overvalues every single player and asset he has in his treasure chest. He is the cheapest bastard running an NBA team
Yea but them signing Jerami Grant hasn't helped... Sekou barely been playing.
"This seems like a dictionary definition win/win on the surface... if youre the Pistons you gotta be thinking about selling high on Jerami like this. How would he slot in with the Jays though is the question... Brown 2, Tatum 3, Grant 4?"
"Why do you think that? Serious question. Jerami is a better defender 1-5 perimeter and inside. Both good finishers inside and Murray is slightly better shooter. I‚Äôd also think his efficiency is buoyed heavily by Jokic‚Äôs passing and presence, while Grants efficiency takes a hit from being the main guy on the Pistons and having to take shitty shots at the end of the shot clock. Grant is a better rebounder (still kinda iffy though) and Murray is a better passer but still not great. I‚Äôm not saying Grant is better but I definitely think it‚Äôs close. I probably wouldn‚Äôt want to trade Jerami for Murray right now 1 for 1 if salary was a non-issue"
"I disagree. You have dudes like Giannis, Tobias Harris, Zion, AD (who spends more minutes at power forward than center by far), Bam sometimes, John Collins, Lauri Markannen, Draymond Green, Jerami Grant.  I get your argument about there not being a ton of natural power forwards, but i'd just argue the skill sets for that position has just improved to the point where theyre more capable of doing things like guarding wing players or big men. Lots of these dudes still get buckets in the paint and are athletic, but many also shoot or playmake."
Jerami Grant has about as much of chance of ending up on the Celtics as I do.
"Fucking hell, if 2 late firsts and salary matching is all it takes, then the Jazz could have already shipped out Bojan and 3 late firsts and a few seconds for Grant. No way Pistons move Jerami Grant for this paltry package."
"Jerami Grant is a perfect player for us, we have two playable wings, we need another if we want to be something serious.  But OP is right, this summer we basically announced TT on our twitter account and once Indiana stopped telling everything to the media, nobody knew what was going on with Hayward and Charlotte."
That pick might possibly end up being as good as Jerami Grant!
Nobody's talking about this - Jerami Grant wanted to go to a black city and play for a black coach. If Detroit immediately traded him that would ruin their optics with players.
"&gt;Dude is a career 10 PPG scorer who's averaging 23  Why yes, he is in fact getting better.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't know if Jerami Grant is the solution to the Celtics problems, but the Nuggets certainly looked better with him than without him, so I think he can work without being the main guy."
Using career numbers makes negative amounts of sense  Jerami Grant is scoring at above average efficiency
"Man, Bill Simmons will be in absolute shambles if this happens. He‚Äôs got a major hard-on for Harrison Barnes and has been down on Jerami Grant all season.  Of course, if the Celts get him, he‚Äôll most likely pivot into being high on him again as a ‚Äú4th Option.‚Äù"
"Jerami Grant wanted to play for a black coach and a black GM in a black city, and then he gets traded to Boston of all places lmao."
"Ad should qualify as a Pf imo. We also have Julius Randle , Domantas Sabonis , Christian Wood is rising , if Jerami Grant plays Pf then he is also a rising star but yeah still not as much power in it."
The disrespect to Jerami Grant
"Randle, Wiggins, Jerami Grant, Kyle Lowry. Like this year Kuzma had his most efficient season ever, if he was given more touches he'd be playing better than his rookie year. He probably won't become a star in this league but he has above average role player right this second with potential to do what Jerami Grant does in Detroit."
"Wiggins showed improvements too. Like If you actually look at how Kuzma shoots the ball, he's shooting at a slightly more efficient rate compared to when he started. He's rebounding about the same but he's getting more offensive boards. His scoring output is down and it's down because he's getting less touches. Right now he's basically NBA starter on a bad team, role player on a championship team (as what happened last year). Maybe he has a Jerami Grant potential jump in him, no one saw Jerami Grant doing what he did this year."
"&gt; Players that put up huge stats on shit teams are obviously incredible players.   Not always.  I agree with the assessment that someone has to get those stats and if you're the leading scorer on an awful team, there are times where you're probably more of a role player on a really good team.  I think that Kuzma can be the leading scorer on a bad team, but only a role player on a good team.  Other examples are Drummond, Jerami Grant, and Andrew Wiggins."
"I appreciate the idea with the Pacers but when you look at the Blazers needs in depth it doesn't really work out.  The Blazers desperately need a proper small forward; a 3-guard lineup doesn't work especially when the backcourt duo of Dame and CJ are poor defenders. I know everybody wants to see CJ traded but he's essentially an overpaid point guard. Salary match is a massive issue to the point where it's going to hamper any return they could get on him.  Also it doesn't help that there isn't any big, defensive wings available. They tried for Aaron Gordon and came out short. Jerami Grant went to Detroit. I think Jerami Grant could be available but that would require forking over a ton of assets and probably finding a 3rd team for CJ since Detroit is trying to bottom out. Evan Fournier may be available if you overpay him, but he's not there to play defense. Same with Kelly Oubre.  Going back to an Indiana-Portland trade; neither Brogdon and Lamb are proper small forwards. They're bigger shooting guards and neither are defensive lynchpins. I just don't see what Portland gets out of that."
I think a Jerami Grant type would be good for portland and some good defenders for their bench.  Idk if that wins them a chip tho
"What would Detroit want for Jerami Grant? I like the idea of Brogdon as well. Both players are good defenders and Brogdon is a good playmaker.     Anyone know what kind of assets would be needed to get them? We have all of our first round picks after this year. Although, I wouldn't want to use too many at this point unless its for a proven star."
"I thought about this yesterday too, but wasn't sure how highly regarded Brogdon was. I think he'd be the perfect compliment for Dame. Dame, Brogdon, Powell would be a good foundation to build something, but it isn't the championship move you want to see. Maybe they can trade some picks and add Jerami Grant to that mix and they can be a top defense with a lot of firepower on offense. They have to get really creative."
"I saw a bleacher report proposed trade of smthn like kuzma, a first and 2 seconds for jerami grant lmao foh w that shit"
Pistons sub have had no less than three Lakers fans posting in there this week that a Kuz and a late first would get a Jerami Grant trade done. Absolute insanity.
"Some folks in the media have legit been trying to speak a Kuzma + some trash picks for Jerami Grant trade into existence, and it's just adorable"
"they may not be able to move CJ, but they need to get a 3rd star and something like a jerami grant and a crowder.  they gotta make 2 to 3 significant roster moves otherwise i think they will regret it."
"I dont know Jerami Grant kinda had a glow up this year, I would be worried that teams have noticed."
"I think you‚Äôre low on that number, they are both very effective, Mikal was a huge part of their success in the reg season and Aytons been huge against the Lakers in the playoffs. They‚Äôre both playing at 20+ mil level and then it‚Äôs potential on top of that which isn‚Äôt just a little bump, they both have near ideal bodies and elite potential. I agree with you, I don‚Äôt want to have to pay them that much but it‚Äôs what you have to do in this league otherwise you‚Äôre just hoping for good free agent signings and you can‚Äôt really bank on that. This core is proving they can win in the reg season and in the playoffs. Mikal is easily worth 22 mil to me, Ayton at 34 mil is definitely a risk. If he wasn‚Äôt playing well in the playoffs I wouldn‚Äôt want to pay him at all. Mikal has improved in shot creation and his skill set is heavily catered to being an off ball player and that‚Äôs ok, this team has Booker and Chris Paul to handle that. In his role, he‚Äôs worth it. If he was in Jerami Grants role he wouldn‚Äôt be, just like Grant isn‚Äôt. Aytons value is also as a defensive anchor and has decent gravity inside and on offensive boards so his role isn‚Äôt shot creation either. I see where you‚Äôre coming from and would have agreed especially about Ayton but I don‚Äôt think you can just let them walk because they might be overpaid. You just have to hope for the best and develop the hell out of them imo."
"Last year's bench was Morris, Beasley, Jerami Grant, MPJ, and Plumee. That team is a 6 seed in the East"
Jerami Grant?
lmao he‚Äôs not Jerami Grant but did u not watch the game?
I don't think it needs a blow up but they do need to shake things up. Try to find a trade for CJ. But I have no idea who to get. Ideally someone with some defense to help Dame and secondary playmaking. Jerami Grant maybe?
"Even crazier when you realize we've also drafted/signed really good quality players in Malik Beasley, Torrey Craig and Huancho who we just didn't have the money to keep around. Not sure how we keep replacing guys but it's nice. Pretty sure Hampton is gonna wind up to be a good player too, but I'm fine with giving up him to get AG.  Also nailed it with the Jerami Grant trade last year. Acquiring PJ Dozier was clutch too. I thought we were gonna take a dip in that department when Masai left but we really haven't missed a beat."
"&gt; Why hasn't Jokic left Denver for Chicago  I mean, money trumps all. But the NBA was aware smaller markets had a tougher time retaining and attaining talent so they introduced the supermax so teams who draft players can actually keep them, because money is the great equalizer.   &gt; SA signed LMA...that was one of the biggest FA signings the last 10 years I'd say.  Fair point. But again, my argument *isn't* that large markets get all the free agents, it's that they have a much easier hill to climb to get the high powered, star FAs.   This bleeds into your point about the mid-tier FAs. I think money and success matter a *lot more* to that tier of players, which is why you see Detroit getting Jerami Grant and Bojan going to Utah and Brogdon going to Indiana.   The problem is, those guys don't win you championships and the guys who *do* win championships are easier to attain if you are a team in a large, attractive market. The Heatles don't ever form in Memphis, KD/Kyrie/Harden never meet-up in Charlotte, AD doesn't force his way out of New Orleans to end up in Utah.   At this point, you're more than free to keep arguing that market size doesn't have an impact at all on FA signings, but I'm done."
"I think he‚Äôs talking more about the athletic floor being raised. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs bringing up the average. Jordans and Ervings and Carters have and will always exist as freaks at the top of the athletic range but watching back then the bigs especially were slow, low vertical guys cause they didn‚Äôt have to be athletic. Now every center who gets significant minutes has to be able to move their feet, jump, run the floor, or be incredibly skilled (i.e. jokic). Now we have a laundry list of 6-9 to 6-11 athletes like bam, mpj, John Collins, and jerami grant who fill out rosters instead of the 7-1 bruisers of the past cause they get run off the court much easier."
"2014 was not a good draft class according to most sources.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2915855-ranking-the-worst-nba-draft-classes-since-2000   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-draft-looking-back-and-ranking-the-five-worst-draft-classes-since-2000/  BR has them as the 7th worst since 2000, CBSsports ranked them at 5th worst.   Embiid and the Joker are having good seasons but the rest of that draft class is underwhelming. Out of the top ten picks, 5 have turned out to be busts: Parker, Wiggins, Exum, Stauskas and Vonleh.  Only 2 of those players are even in the league now (Wiggins, Parker).   That being said, there were some good players taken late in the draft, like Jokic, Joe Harris, and Jerami Grant. So maybe there was more talent to be had that year, but the execs just botched it.    Whatever the case, I wouldn't call it a stacked draft."
"""Kuz and a second for Jerami Grant, who says no?"""
"LeBron wants Jerami Grant, based on their body language at the end of last years' Nuggets series.  Could a Kuzma-Grant trade work? Lakers would have to throw in some stuff."
"grant brooks jjjr  how? don't know. but Draymond said better. Memphis needs to decide now if they gonna run it back or not. I believe that they should change now, get Dallas pick and find another star to pair with Ja. They're underutilizing JJJr. And there's no way they trade Dillon.  go for Jerami Grant, and find a fucking rim protector ffs. Nets found Claxton, so it's not impossible.  IMO, the more important move should be in FO (look Boston). but it's not gonna happen."
wiseman some bench foddar to get to 16mil plus the picks for jerami grant(:
"Guys like Tatum, PJ Tucker, Jerami Grant and other wings built his size (can't list em all off the top of my head) have really held him down when guarded by them, especially since leaving Toronto &amp; Lowry to the point where he needs switches to be able to score in the clutch."
To be fair Pistons didn't have Jerami Grant as well
"Clarkson, Jerami Grant, LaVine, MPJ, Sabonis, Rozier, Dillon Brooks, Bojan, DRose, Sexton... that's just off the top of my head.  The list is larger than you might think, that's a large contract"
"Portland isn't giving up McCollum, Simons and picks for Jerami Grant my dude"
"This is high level comedy I hope. I know everyone already hates on Stotts but Malone is barely better. Malone is good at wringing effort out of low-level players, but his rotations are legitimately awful. Remember that Celtics game where he literally handed the game away because he left the bench in far too long while they were getting rammed?   His plays are also incredibly uninspired. Jerami Grant may not be actually as good as he looks in Detroit but he definitely is better than he looked in Denver. Malone heavily relies on the two-man game between Jokic and Jamal and completely underuses everyone else on the court.    If I was Jokic I'd tell the FO it's him or me."
Well his chubby and slow and not athletic. We make it work though. We just have to find the Jerami Grant/Aaron Gordon type guys who are look enough to take on a big defensively
CJ for Jerami Grant and picks if Detroit feeling spicy
"Here‚Äôs [Jerami Grant](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsDmc6LXAAAnNSv.jpg) rocking the fuck out of one of those horsey jerseys, it‚Äôs annoying how ugly our current away/alternate jerseys are when we‚Äôve had such sick ones in the past."
"I could see the Warriors moving their draft pick and Wiggins for KP esp if they aren‚Äôt getting any better offers   Still think if the Warriors want Jerami Grant they can get him  Wiseman, both first rounders, Wiggins for Grant"
Dallas should look to trade the whole farm for Jerami Grant
"Grant def should have won MIP, these dudes are mad like Detroit didn‚Äôt have the worst roster in the league lmao. Grant went from a solid 7th man to #1 option scoring 10pts above his avg. Julius basically had the same stats from 2018-19, 19-20. New York media is the difference between the 2 though. I bet Jerami wouldn‚Äôt perform this piss poor in the playoffs."
"You are nuts! Jokic is better MPJ is better, Murray would‚Äôve been better w our injury. Also AG &gt; Jerami Grant"
"Comparing to last year, Gordon is not purely an addition as he is a replacement for Jerami Grant. Both are solid defenders but only one is a good scorer and scoring is what we need right now."
"My bad, either I was thinking of the Bucks or Jerami Grant."
"MPJ improved a lot but he's struggling with consistency, especially now in the playoffs, which is perfectly understandable considering his age. But even if he played better, I wish that would have been enough for us to truly be better than last year.   Jerami Grant is an excellent two-way player and we couldn't really find a replacement for him. Gordon is good on defence but sometimes invisible on offence. Jamychal Green is okay as a backup but nothing more. Milsap is one year older and he can give you a quarter of good basketball every like five games but that's it.  People forget how important Gary Harris was last year. Him coming back from injury turned that series vs Jazz. Murray balled out but we actually lost one of those games where he scored 50 and then won the last two with Harris. Craig was great on defence as well and our replacements for him are PJ Dozier (injured) and Zeke Nnaji (not playing).  Plumlee had his issues (AD buzzer beater flashback) but he was a solid backup big overall and we couldn't find a replacement for him. Javale isn't playing much and we usually go with Green at five which isn't working that well.  Campazzo is a positive but he's not much of a scorer and we need scoring badly. He would be a backup with Murray healthy but our bench is terrible at scoring anyways, so he wouldn't contribute much on that end anyway. Morris is playing worse than last year. And yeah, Barton is injured again although he might come back in the next few games."
"Knicks are dumb if they max Randle. Best move would be trading him for a haul.   You might even be able to get a guy like Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neal or Joe Ingles. Could call the Kings about Harrison Barnes and Bagley or Hield. Ask Detroit for Jerami Grant? Try to swap him out for Wiggins &amp; FRP? Lauri and Young? Deni and Bertans? Robinson/Herro and Oladipo? Collins and Reddish? Joe Harris and Green/Brown? Hardaway &amp; Kleber or Richardson and DFS? RoCo/DJJ &amp; Powell? White and Walker? Poku and Dort?  Hayward + PJW for Randle &amp; Bullock?  Turner + Warren for Randle and Knox?  Randle + FRP for Tobias?  Randle, Quickley and Robinson + FRPs for George, Bev Oturu?"
"Process OG here.  &amp;#x200B;  Big losses: Fultz, MCW, KJ McDaniels, Sauce Castillo, Wroten  &amp;#x200B;  Big gainzz: Embiid, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, RoCo, Dario, Thybulle  &amp;#x200B;  I was also high on Nerlens and It's not clear to me if he's a win or not. He is an awesome player defensively, but I think he's more of a HODL"
"bertans, deni and a pick for jerami grant"
Jerami Grant beat him after going 3-1 down lol
"you have the best playmaker in the league but you run the offense through facundo campazzo instead  just another year in michael baloney's career, somehow topping playing will barton over jerami grant last year"
Same thoughts on Jerami Grant.
Jerami Grant is up there too
Maybe Harrison Barnes or Jerami Grant
"That sorry ass team had Odalipo, Adams, and an incredibly deep bench that included Sabonis, McDermottc and Jerami Grant. They were worse than the 2021 Warriors, but not by much.   That being said, Westbrook had one of the most amazing seasons in NBA history and did an absolutely amazing carry-job that year. I don‚Äôt see the point in detracting from Steph for not having been on that level. He still played out of his mind this season and was at absolutely no fault for missing the playoffs"
"We hooked Portland up with nurkic, too.   Gave the wolves Beasley and Juancho.  Okc got a first from us for Jerami grant, too. Not sure who that ended up being, but surely they will be an all star soon.   Tim Connelly really out here building contenders for the entire Northwest division. Based."
"I think Aaron Gordon would‚Äôve been exactly what you needed, same with Jerami Grant. Maybe Danny Green is an option for next year, he‚Äôs still a good defender"
"AD and Lebron weren't why we lost in 5 last year. They played well, but it was Dwight who kept Jokic on the bench in foul trouble and Rondo who stuffed any runs with some insane pass. The Lakers center depth is horrible this year, and AG is much better than Jerami Grant when our starting backcourt is healthy."
Yea and I know he can‚Äôt guard Lebron like Jerami Grant
As is tradition. Remember Jerami Grant last year in the bubble?
"Maybe the departure of Jerami Grant was a blessing in disguise, look at MPJ now man.."
We need jerami grant
"Kawhi isn't a good example here because even most Spurs fans will tell you that the system prevented him from showing his full potential offensively. He was always capable of being a 20 PPG scorer in his early years but because Pop had a system in place and Tim, Parker, and Gino were more proven veterans at that time, Kawhi was often the 4th or 5th option for them. It strictly had more to do with a lack of offensive opportunities rather than Kawhi 'developing' his scoring capabilities.  Jimmy Butler is probably the best example here. Thibs treated him as a defensive stopper but once Rose became hobbled by injuries, Jimmy just took his game to a whole other level offensively.  Jerami Grant is another example. Strictly defensive player for the majority of his early career because of his length but then developed into being a good scorer.  Gary Payton is probably another good example but during his team, PG's weren't expected to score so it's a bit different in his case. Nonetheless, he was more of a defensive talent early on in his career and then developed to being more of a scorer."
"Kawhi, Jimmy butler, and maybe Jerami Grant to a much lesser extent."
"I don't understand why he even would. This kind of thing probably hurts his standing with FAs. It's not super common but there are players out there for whom this matters, like Jerami Grant."
"It's going to be really interesting to see how much Tim Hardaway Jr., Norm Powell and Gary Trent Jr. all get this offseason.  Similar sizes &amp; player profiles between all of them, Trent is younger than Norm/THJ but has the least off-the-bounce juice of the trio (plus he's an RFA).  I think all 3 could be getting Jerami Grant $$$ when it comes down to it.  Makes someone like Terrence Ross look like a bargain (he's not as good as any of these 3 but will be making ""only"" $12.5M next year and $11.5M in 22-23)"
"Yeah lol. This says more about the Atlantic division than anything.  Like let‚Äôs look at central division: Giannis, Sabonis, LaVine, Sexton, Jerami Grant  Southeast: Trae, Butler, Beal and Westbrook, Lamelo and Hayward, not sure who on the magic  Northwest: Mitchell/Conley or Gobert (first scoring option vs best played), Jokic, Dame, KAT, Shai  Pacific: CP3 and Booker, Kawhi, PG, Lebron and AD, Steph, Fox  Southwest: Doncic, Ja, DeRozen, Zion, Not sure about if rockets would be KPJ, Christian Wood etc.  I‚Äôd say only the Pacific has a better list of first options and even that might be somewhat arguable depending on how people rank some of the guys mentioned."
Less great of a return when you realize it was Fultz and Jerami Grant
Jerami Grant was the real MIP not this fraud
"19th most FTA per game in the league. He‚Äôs getting an amazing whistle this game but he isn‚Äôt known for respect from refs so much.  Random players that are above him include Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Collin Sexton"
Plus it looks like Detroit got a stud in Jerami Grant. He seems like a better option to build the future on than Blake.
"Low key shout out to Jerami Grant. Both sides, player and team, took a bet.   Both won."
"Jerami Grant can win in some other years, but this year, Randle killed it. The improvement is immense!"
"I guess, but I still don't really think that holds water. He upped his ppg by like 5, doubled his assists, and his 3 point shooting exploded.  Jerami Grant and Christian wood just got to be a focal point of their offenses on shit teams. I get voting for them, but I don't really know who else you'd put besides Randle."
Jerami Grant was robbed
Jerami Grant is easily better than Joe Harris
"&gt;Detroit, Houston  Jerami Grant and Christian Wood are far better all-around players than Joe.  Joe is a specialist"
Jerami Grant is easily better. Christian Wood and KPJ are both easily better.
Well deserved... he completely turned himself around for the better. S/O to Jerami Grant too.
"For a while, it looked like Jerami Grant might run away with it. Then the Pistons remembered they sucked and Randle and the Knicks really put together a run."
Sorry Jerami Grant
"Jerami Grant, MPJ, Boucher"
"Also Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Landry Shaker, possibly? Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Iguodala, Lou Will"
"Explain, in a vaccuum, how exactly the 5th pick in this draft would be worth less than Jerami Grant making a ton of money."
"Yeah, that pick could be anything. It could even be another Jerami Grant!"
"If it conveys at 4 or 5, Warriors might just keep it. The upside of those top 6 guys is higher than Jerami Grant."
Wiseman and Minny‚Äôs pick for Jerami Grant.
"I don't believe in it either in most cases. As a Pistons fan I hear it all the time with regards to Jerami Grant, but I didn't know what other term to use. However, there are some guys who really do put up empty stats (Drummond, Morris on the Knicks, Tim Hardaway Jr on the Knicks)"
I watched him throw up 16 points on 15 shots instead of Jerami Grant.  He was legitimately terrible
Jerami Grant
"I would argue only player had a definitively better season than Curry and that would be Jokiƒá. Homer opinion but deal with it. I think a large part of Curry's incredible success depends on the lack of any other offensive help he had for the season and that showed when he really ramped up later in the season to fill the void. I'm also of the opinion every nba player is capable of 25 a night in the right situation, look at Jerami Grant. And about half the league is capable of a 50 point performance on their best night, look at Kevin Porter Jr.  So his great season is more of a function of the lack of talent on the Warriors.  The numbers for the past season would not agree, but I would argue that Harden, AD, and Embiid are all better players. I would also posit that LeBron and KD are also similarly talented that you could put them higher or lower than Steph. None of these guys had the statistical season that Steph did, but they're seasons all led to an opportunity to win the Larry OB. The fans of the NBA are ridiculously obsessed with individual statistics as a way of determining who the best is, but I believe that team success is a better measure. It shows how much an individual can improve the players around them. Steph didn't make any of his teammates that much better this season. LeBron, Harden and Jokiƒá always do, Embiid and AD are such talented defenders it makes their teammates lives much easier. KD and Steph are different from the others because they create for themselves at a much more elite level, but don't have as much impact on the improvement of their teammates on either side of the ball. Steph still had Kerr and Green, so the potential was there for more success.  Don't take this as unnecessary Steph hate, he's no question a top 15 player ever, likely top 10 and I'd even listen to an argument that he's top 5. An incredible offensive season that doesn't result in playoffs doesn't mean much the same way going 73-9 without a ring doesn't mean much."
"Haven't watched much of Jerami Grant lately but I'd consider that trade strongly. Plumlee is a great glue guy at C, and I actually think we need one of those more than a scorer at the position. And a closing lineup of Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Grant/Dray would solve a lot of spacing issues, assuming Klay comes back 80% of his former self.  Some other Warriors fans my balk at that, but like I said I'm bullish on Wiseman. The issue is his timeline. He is probably _not_ gonna be a positive on the court for another 2-3 years, when he's 23/24. It took Giannis forever to develop his game, and I see a lot of the similar [raw athletic potential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ6qPIGLOB0) in Wiseman, albeit at a different position.  It's possible the FO drafted BPA with hopes that he either succeeds immediately, or shows enough potential to trade for an established piece. Jerami Grant could be that kind of piece, if his numbers aren't just him padding the stats."
"Man that Wiseman pick was really baffling, especially with the reports that [Warriors promised Lamelo](https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2021/03/09/warriors-nba-draft-promise-lamelo-ball/) they‚Äôd draft him, Lamelo [indicating he was going 2](https://youtu.be/oKo6U3B6RVg) on draft night, and then even after Klay‚Äôs injury they still took Wiseman.   Warriors seem to be trying to rebuild AND compete at the same time. It‚Äôs so dumb, that‚Äôs how you end up in mediocrity.   My question to you is, what trade targets do you see the Warriors targeting in the off-season? Would you accept a Jerami Grant + Plumlee deal for Wiseman + filler + Minny pick? Grant is an elite 2 way forward putting up 23 ppg and Plumlee would fit the Warriors system really well with his Jokic-lite passing"
Jerami Grant and Collin Sexton come to mind too
"The Westbrook team with Sabonis, Oladipo, Jerami Grant and other solid role players? Real lottery team there."
**Pistons** (no order)  Killian Hayes  Saddiq Bey  Jerami Grant  Beef Stew  Sekou Doumbouya
"Just for the record, that Russ team had Roberson, Adam‚Äôs, Oladipo, Jerami Grant, Sabonis. Those last three guys are STUDS and all stars. All three guys blew up after leaving OKC. Russ didn‚Äôt get the max value out of those guys cause he‚Äôs too selfish. He‚Äôs a great solo act but he has a ceiling cause he holds the rest of his teammates back.   &amp;#x200B;  Also...Steven Adam‚Äôs is a beast check out some of his YouTube vids - criminally underrated center, another gem from okc general manager."
"we're young and still developing players. no reason to throw the bag at jerami grant. he's not worth that huge contract anyway.  i dont know what the offers were but im guessing they werent spectacular, it took a long time to reach a deal."
If we didn‚Äôt do the Winslow trade we could have taken the other offers that were on the table for Iggy and with the cap space from last off-season we could have targeted a guy like Jerami Grant. I like Kleman but he took a major L on that trade. I have no doubt the Miami Heat knew Winslow was physically broken when they traded him
"MPJ has probably improved the most of those on this list, but he is only in his second year playing in the league. I have a hard time calling a player as young as him the MIP when tons of players every year take big jumps from their first to second year. I think Jerami Grant moving from role player to near all start deserves the award this year."
"It might get deleted since the Athletic will reach out to the mods if an article is copy/pasted, but here‚Äôs just the lists without the blurb included:  - Wizards: KAT - Celtics: Zach LaVine - Warriors/Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram - Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox - Hawks: LaMelo - Knicks: Lowry - Lakers: Siakam - Blazers: Jerami Grant - Mavs: Vucevic - Bucks: Fred VanVleet - Clippers: DeRozan - Nuggets: Terry Rozier - Nets: Harrison Barnes - Sixers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell - Suns: Christian Wood - Jazz: Collin Sexton"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. ‚Äî Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn‚Äôs Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown‚Äôs defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. ‚Äî Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we‚Äôve created. ‚Äî James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De‚ÄôAaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox‚Äôs ability to put pressure on the rim ‚Äî as well as finish when he gets there ‚Äî would open up more room for Miami‚Äôs shooters. ‚Äî Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he‚Äôs inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. ‚Äî Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard ‚Äî it‚Äôs their greatest position of need ‚Äî and Lowry is the best available. He‚Äôd slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton‚Äôs minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn‚Äôt long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. ‚Äî Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I‚Äôm just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn‚Äôt have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He‚Äôll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That‚Äôs fierce. ‚Äî Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he‚Äôd fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. ‚Äî Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? ‚Äî Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet‚Äôs efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he‚Äôs still a bad man. He‚Äôd fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they‚Äôd be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. ‚Äî Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who‚Äôs their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. ‚Äî Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray‚Äôs absence somehow and although Rozier isn‚Äôt the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that‚Äôll play alongside Nikola Jokic. ‚Äî Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don‚Äôt really have weaknesses, so it‚Äôd be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. ‚Äî Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that‚Äôs what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  ‚Äî Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns‚Äô biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there‚Äôs no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. ‚Äî Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I‚Äôm not sure, which is why I‚Äôm bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I‚Äôm going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
Uh no? The right answer is clearly Jerami Grant.
"Please stop, your comment has brought unnecessary hate to Pistons legend Jerami Grant."
"The Sixers were an embarrassment and ruined basketball by unearthing players like Robert Covington, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Christian Wood and Richaun Holmes."
"Give me Mikal Bridges, OG, and Jerami Grant from that list."
Yeah Mikal is an A+ roleplayer but I really think OG has a much higher ceiling simply cause of the fact that he's such a better physical prospect. I think if you ramped up Mikal's usage the way Toronto is for OG you'd end up with a Jerami grant situation where his efficiency free falls.
"Would you take Jerami Grant for that package? Elite 2 way wing that can avg. 24 &amp; lock up the best players in the playoffs. He &amp; Wiggins would be nasty together, defensively n offensively."
"Even though ""passed on Jokic four times"" sounds bad, I think it's worth saying only one was a whiff - they picked Embiid, Saric (through picking Payton and sending him to ORL), KJ McDaniels [there it is], and Jerami Grant.  It would be nice to have had Jokic instead of any of the latter three, of course, but aside from that I'd say that's a pretty successful four picks spread across two rounds of a draft."
no jerami grant slander smdh
"These dudes are chucking on a team with a 7 man rotation and that banned John Wall from playing because they might win.  NBA is not like football... you aren't gonna get shut out and you need to get your points somewhere.   We see it all the time.. players usage goes up on a shit team and you think he's a lot better than he is-- aka Drummond, Jerami Grant, Gary Harris, etc.  A team would be foolish to pay Olynk wood  tate or porter based off numbers from chucking in garbage time."
"It will still be Lakers in 5, Jerami Grant is better than Aaron Gordon."
"Mavs without Luka beat us without jerami grant, plumlee, cojo, ellington, and  dsj"
"Top 10 isn't crazy bad but it get bad pretty quickly with 2k lol. Ben Simmons is 36th overall behind Deaaron Fox, Kristaps, and Derozan. CJ's rating seems really low. Mikal Bridges is rated higher than Jerami Grant. Embiid and Seth Curry have the same 3pt rating. 2k has a lot of wack ratings lol"
so is jerami grant haha
"A lot of good candidates including MPJr, Jerami Grant is a good one too but I have to go with Randle. He was a 20 PPG scorer but he improved his defense, 3 pt, playmaking, and just being a smarter scorer overall. A guy you can go to at the end of games, also helped lead the Knicks to 4th seed."
"These are pretty solid answers, anyone in that sorta mold.   I would add Jerami Grant too."
"I really like what Presti has done in OKC, and I highly approve of his current rebuilding plan (granted, I'm a Hinkie-stan for life).          By maximizing your potential of landing a franchise-changing player, you can also give your young prospects lots of PT to develop and you will discover hidden gems in the Process. For example, the Sixers under Hinkie found Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, and Richaun Holmes, among others, and gave all of them a chance to showcase flashes of talent that eventually blossomed into consistent talent and earned them solid-to-great contracts around the league."
When was Jerami Grant ever one of the greatest 40 year olds in NBA history?
I mean Keef is a solid vet but he wouldn‚Äôt push the needle for the Wolves at all.  I would think a guy in the mood of Jerami Grant which is I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre trying to get out of McDaniels.
Jerami Grant too.  Nerlins blocking shots in New York.  Mad process guys about
Feel like playing Jerami Grant is different than the other 2
"Jerami Grant indeed has a +11 increase in ppg but he also takes almost 9 more shots per game. He's incredibly inefficient (42.8% FG, 35.4% 3s), and his team is really really bad. Randle actually has a +4.5 PPG, with 3 more assists while shooting 46% FG and 42% 3pt, while leading the Knicks to the 4th seed."
"I 100% agree. The rest of the field is far behind Randle, but I've been impressed by some players who are taking the leap like De'arron Fox, Jerami Grant, Michael Porter Jr., and even Miles Bridges as of late."

"Ther are a lot of win now players in the range of $18m or less  Rozier, Derrick White, Christian Wood, Jonas Valanciunas, and Steven Adams are all good players on non-contenders that would help the Warriors be very good. I can definitely see that package not only netting one of these dudes, but potentially get an extra draft asset back in return.  If the Pacers decide to retool/rebuild due to missing the playoffs, they could conceivably trade for Myles Turner, TJ Warren, Caris LeVert, or even Sabonis potentially  They would have to throw in one of their minimum players to get Sabonis, as his salary is slightly above $18m, but it would definitely be a worthwhile trade if the Pacers are willing. Same goes for other good players like Buddy Hield or Jerami Grant."
"Throw money at someone who has potential to grow into better player. Like the pistons did with Jerami Grant, who turned into a legit asset. unlike Love where his contract depreciates each year he gets older."
"Is that a real question? It happens all the time lol.  Jerami grant, Gordon hayward (at the time the Hornets were not good) just this past offseason.   Young guys are usually looking to get paid, not win"
jerami grant
"Malone‚Äôs biggest weakness is his rotations IMO. Other than that, I think he‚Äôs a pretty good coach. Yeah, maybe he gets bailed out a bit by his star players, but every coach does. NBA is a star driven league.  Strengths:  -	Culture/chemistry/locker room. Not sure exactly what you want to call this, but he‚Äôs absolutely been great at getting guys to buy in to the culture. After the shaw debacle and our culture was in the toilet, he rebuilt it. Jokic was a big part of that, but you also have to think about the fact that there‚Äôs plenty of orgs where Jokic could have gone and never achieved the greatness he has now. The culture and locker room are part of that. Same thing with MPJ. -	player development. This kind of ties into the above, but we have had a seriously great run of young guys coming in. A big part of that is Connelly drafting well, but you have to give Malone credit for his staff developing those guys into players as well   Weaknesses:  -	Rotations. I think that all of us routinely want to pull our hair out at some of his rotation decisions. Especially when he falls in love with a defensive hustle guy (like facu or craig) and arguably plays them way too often and in lineups that don‚Äôt make sense. I think there‚Äôs also an aspect of line up identity - more so with the bench than the starters - that sometimes gets lost. What roles is each guy playing? What is that lineup trying to do? I think Malone doesn‚Äôt look at it from the perspective of ‚Äúokay this bench unit is going to have the 1/5 pnr as its bread and butter with XYZ as secondary options out of ABC sets‚Äù etc. I think for him he views everything through the lens of effort and defense. Even if it means playing a 4 guard lineup with PJ dozier at PF and Millsap at C. All that said, he is a pretty successful NBA coach, so it‚Äôs possible he knows more than we do here - and part of these baffling rotations might actually tie in to his management style that helps with the first bullet point under strengths to build a good locker room chemistry.  Middling:  -	X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs. I put this here because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs explicitly a weakness, but I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a huge strength like it is for some of the other coaches in the league. And that‚Äôs OK, since different coaches have different styles. Especially when you have a savant like Jokic who just needs a loose framework in place to build off of and he does the minutiae himself. I do think part of the reason this isn‚Äôt a strength is tied back into the rotation thing. A coach who is strong at X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs is likely going to extend that same strategic thinking to the overall lineups and rotations. Guys are in for a reason because they are cogs in the machines and the sets. They have a role and a purpose. That‚Äôs not to say that‚Äôs totally absent with Malone, but again I think he views everything through effort and defense first and foremost. His overall philosophy is if you have those ingredients first and foremost, everything else will work itself out. You can overcome lineup deficiencies through that effort. I don‚Äôt necessarily agree, because I think there‚Äôs sometimes where you‚Äôre just simply outmatched on the chess board, but given that this is lost lot gripes about bench units, it doesn‚Äôt matter as much. Starters being matched up on the chess board is much more about the GM constructing the roster (ie getting Jerami grant and Aaron Gordon to match up with lebron/kawhi). Assuming the GM and coach are on the same page, anyway. Not always the case with guys like Javale McGee not getting minutes, but again that‚Äôs more of a bench thing."
"Im gonna ignore Wall's contract because realistically no one would take a chance on him for because of how expensive he is. Fit also doesn't matter either on this list because I believe in making talent work.  Knicks- Still have no solid solution at PG. If they flopped signing anyone in FA, I don't see why not.  Pistons- They don't have the talent to turn away players of any cailber. Plus if I remember correctly, Jerami Grant has high expectations for the team going forward so a move for Wall wouldn't be the worst idea.  Bulls- Also in dire need of a PG, if they miss out on Lonzo/CP/Any PG, why wouldn't they want take a chance on Wall to please LaVine? Tho it would be ironic because I remember Wall vs Rose being a thing way back lol  Heat- A bit of a stretch but Wall has a personality that would fit in nicely here. Dragic seems unreliable at times, Nunn is inconsistent and Herro doesn't feel like a traditional PG (tho there's still time for him to grow into one if that's the plan).  Magic- Another team too bad to say no to talent. I wouldn't be surprised if there was uncertainty around Fultz before his ACL injury.   Teams I could list but I wont explain: Nuggets, Rockets, Mavericks, Clippers"
Jerami Grant was an overpay
"Jerami Grant, though technically his 7th not 6th I believe."
he's good but not elite. There are better. Huge upgrade over Millsap however and it really helped fill the hole Jerami Grant left last summer
"My man maybe I will take a look. I love Kanter but not Melo. We benched Jerami Grant for Carmelo in 2018 and lost to Utah.  However, I spent a long time reviewing Kanter's game film in Game 6 in the playoffs. And it was a big mistake benching Kanter in Q4. Kanter sets good screens with unstoppable offense. OKC needed Kanter on the floor to generate quality looks. Instead OKC shoots 12 bad quality shots at 28% FG. Kanter would've made a difference.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/my4zss/with\_super\_elite\_offenses\_it\_is\_not\_always\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/my4zss/with_super_elite_offenses_it_is_not_always_the/)"
Don't talk about Jerami Grant like that
"I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for all the Processors and Jerami Grant is as OG as they come. But if he actually thought when he signed that mega-deal in Detroit that they could compete for something meaningful(not just making the playoffs) then he is delusional. Part of the point of the Process was an admission that star free agents arent coming to cities like Philly or Detroit. You're not turning that team around with free agents, and even if they draft LeBron 2.0 its still gonna take him 4 years to develop to a point of carrying the team. Hopefully this is posturing for the fans and the team and he can be real with himself, cause you aint doing shit next year."
"i mean at the time you had an overweight dude from Serbia who had come off of a good year playing in Serbia and who had averaged 3.5 assists. So basically he was closer to a normal center with good passing fundamentals.   Even in his first year in the league you had a guy that was doing 2.4 assists, and while he was very good, was there indicators of him becoming the kind of player he is today (I didn't watch Denver back then). Like even the per 36 numbers his rookie year didn't show that court vision potential off.   For every Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic you end up with a Darko Milicic or Dragan Bender, it's a total crap shoot dealing with the draft and to call these guys idiots when they still had the idea to draft and pick him up still shows that someone viewed him as a prospect with potential.   You can't predict how a player will develop over time, it's pretty idiotic of you to say that these guys are idiots considering they literally have to evaluate 100+ potential players every year that may be worth picking up. 2014 was a draft of underrated gems, Joe Harris and Jerami Grant were both second rounders, Dwight Powell who just put on a show last night with Luka went after Jokic. Potential 6MOTY Jordan Clarkson went at 46. Clint Capela at 25, there were so many great prospects that were drafted all across the board not to mention guys like LaVine and Julius Randle going later in the first round. Everyone is going to remember 2014 for being the a low key bust for the biggest prospects from Wiggins and Parker when in reality it's going to go down as a sleeper draft where some truly elite players went very late in, likely a very difficult draft to call."
"With a 20M deal, Lonzo would be paid more than Lavine, Saboner, Jerami Grant, Bogdan, Bojan, Myles Turner and Wood. Not only there are 2 Allstars here, Pelicans would probably rather have any of these players over Lonzo."

"Blake has a crazy good handle for a power forward and showed that from a very young age, so that‚Äôs probably setting unrealistic expectations.  A solid handle like Jerami Grant or Aaron Gordon could be possible tho"
&gt; In 3 years  Jerami Grant is punching the air rn lmao
"Gordon is better than Grant in the role we need him in. Yeah Jerami had some incredible moments vs the Clippers but overall he was just aight, don‚Äôt let him being better than Gordon in the ‚Äú#1 option on a trash team‚Äù role, which is irrelevant to Denver, confuse"
Jerami Grant would be godly. But he‚Äôll cost you like 5 first round picks so
I think Jerami Grant is going to be even better next season.
"If Lebron is considered the GOAT, jerami grant needs some consideration tbh"
I believe its jerami grant not cuz I wanna be different but because he‚Äôs the best guy on his team all of the sudden whereas julius randle has been good already
"except he drives a LOT more than he used to. He's at the rim pretty frequently these days and you would expect a more favourable whistles for arguably the second most popular player in the NBA. Curry ranks 16th for FTA per ESPN below guys like Jerami Grant, Julius Randle and Shai-Gilderous Alexander. It's most definitely an aberration"
Julius Randle or Jerami Grant.
Jerami grant
I wonder if Jerami Grant still thinks it was a good move.
‚ÄúJerami Grant is so overpaid and will never be more than a role player‚Äù  His 40+ and 30+ point games on high efficiency along with elite defence strongly disagrees with that. Dude is an underpaid monster.
"Trae Young, Bam Adebayo, Fred VanVleet, Gordon Hayward, Jerami Grant, Khris Middleton, Jimmy Butler  There were a lot of really good snubs. Tobias Harris isn't clearly ahead of that pack. Trae Young should have been next up if anything."
Last night Jerami Grant was straight cooking him every possession. If someone switches onto him it‚Äôs an easy layup. His height does help him protect the rim a bit but not as much as you‚Äôd expect.
"Get the hell out of here. Oladipo was still really streaky that year, Adams and Kanter played really well. They had Jerami Grant and Sabonis too. That team wasn‚Äôt as bad as what Steph is dealing with right now. And look no further than Westbrook dealing with an actually bad team right now and he‚Äôs still playing with Beal.  Great players can drag a team to the playoffs but let‚Äôs not act like Westbrook‚Äôs carry job was more improbable than what Steph is doing right now."

Jerami Grant been pulling up in Naruto shirts and Pistons colored Red Wings' jerseys. He's got my vote
"And to think I was enjoying Pistons games because I had Jerami Grant on my fantasy team.üò§  Getting good enough at a time when an all time great pg is about to be traded is another way, only took us 10 years, an amazing pick at 13, our first ever #1 overall pick, a botched trade that landed us Kelly Oubre(leading to CP3) and new gm that has ""it""!"
"The Lakers beat the nuggets in 5 last year when they had Murray and Jerami Grant playing amazing. Gordon is a solid Grant replacement, but being the main defensive guy on Lebron and/or AD is a lot to ask.  If this Lakers squad is healthy they are even better equipped to battle Jokic with Drummond/Gasol."
"Jerian and Jerami Grant, for me"
"**PG:** fuck Fred VanVleet, marry Malcolm Brogdon, kill Collin Sexton   **SG:** fuck Devin Booker, marry Donovan Mitchell, kill Zach Lavine   **SF:** fuck Jimmy Butler, marry Jayston Tatum, kill Paul George   **PF:** fuck Jerami Grant, marry Zion Williamson, kill Julius Randle   **C:** fuck Nikola Jokic, marry Joel Embiid, kill Anthony Davis    I really didn't want to kill Julius Randle but I guess them's the breaks. Fun exercise OP, thanks for posting."
"Start: Fred, DMitch, Jimmy Buckets, Zion, Jokic  Bench: brogdon, booker, PG13, Randle, Embiid  Cut: Sexton, Lavine, Tatum, Jerami Grant, AD(this year)"
"Interestingly, one **could** build the lineup that the Denver nuggets FO was attempting to build this offseason:  Murray  Jrue  MPJ  Jerami  Jokic  Ofc we know grant didn‚Äôt stay as we expected and we got way outbid for jrue. But that lineup on paper is quite good across the board.  Bonus points if you select OG for bench/flex, since we disastrously tried to trade down to select him at 24 (the Donovan Mitchell trade) only to have Masai snipe OG from us at 23. Arguably, we should have just taken him at 12.  That said, even if I were trying to build the above roster, draymond is a way better fit than Jerami is. He just obviously wasn‚Äôt available for our FO when they were crafting their lineup lol. AD would also fit like a glove at the 4 next to Jokic.  So theoretically, one could build a ‚Äúsuper nuggets‚Äù roster (simply because you chose so many nuggets and as a nuggets fan that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm drawn to first) of:  Jamal/FVV  Jrue/SGA  MPJ/OG  Dray/Grant  Jokic/AD  And you‚Äôd have a ton of flexibility. Probably would end up starting AD at the 4. Not sure if you lose too much offensive punch if you also slide dray up to the 3 over MPJ, but it feels wrong bringing draymond off the bench lol.  I feel pretty confident that this roster would do pretty well against any other combination of players from this list, if for no other reason than a lot of them already have a lot of chemistry together and the ones who don‚Äôt fit together incredibly well on paper and have high enough BBIQs that I don‚Äôt think it should be an issue."
"I love Jerami Grant as a player and firmly believe that he has all star potential but Julius Randle has improved in nearly all aspects of the game: multiple levels of scoring, passing, playmaking, defense, leadership and so many other areas."
You‚Äôve got Jerami Grant *right* there and you go with Plumlee? They even went to the same team lol.
"Man, Jerami Grant would be such a good fit for this team."
They really should trade CJ for a scoring wing of some kind. 2 scoring/low defense guards is just unnecessary. Get jerami grant from Detroit or something
"Yeah, that wasn't the best advice, but I did get him LaVine at 41st and Jerami Grant at 65th. Kinda irked cause he hasn't been paying attention, and I wanted those guys. I was pretty confident in both our teams after the draft"
"Harris, Blake, Rose, Knight pre-injury, Jerami Grant, Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey. You don‚Äôt gotta tell me it was an ass decade, I know. Idk what you‚Äôre even trying to do right now. Dre was a losing player, he contributed to L‚Äôs, not W‚Äôs. He was never the best player on any team."
"And who did jokic have? Jamal Murray, Jerami Grant, Paul Millsap, MPJ. Jamal mUrray is the perfect guard to go alongside jokic. KAT's best teammate ever was andrew wiggins. Twolves have failed to build around towns, which is why we have only made the playoffs once."
"&gt; At the end of the year the player with the most points is the MVP.   This was a lot like the NHL system until you mentioned this. Not really sure how I feel about it, as I'm fairly confident Jerami Grant would be top 5 in the MVP race right now, which definitely feels unearned to me."
"Besides Jerami Grant, I think most of us are gonna have to agree with you."
Interested in a Jerami Grant trade? This guy Curry can't shoot
Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee weren't even playing tonight :'(
"I mean, Jerami Grant got $20 million and he‚Äôs considerably worse offensively and doesn‚Äôt rebound (granted a decently better defender). Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any reason Porter would get less than that."
"He is basically averaging 20 on epic percentages for denver. 17 ppg are heavily affected by him getting peanut minutes early in the season. He's a walking 20-10 guy last 2,3 months. He is averaging 25+ easily on some bad team. Jerami Grant is 50x worse scorer and he's averaging more"
"Are you actually a Heat fan? Game 6 vs Boston, took over the entire 4th quarter.  Just last season, 2nd game of the season vs the Bucks, had a chasedown block on Bledsoe that saved the game.  This year has had game-winning blocks on Jerami Grant &amp; Richaun Holmes.  Tons of other big stops in clutch moments on defense over the past 2 years that I cant pinpoint.  He‚Äôs been a very clutch player so far in his young career, you might want to pay more attention"
They are developing. Their best player is Jerami Grant.
About even. Draymond and Wiggins are better than Steven adams and Oladipo by a significant margin. But some of the bench guys like Enes Kanter and Jerami Grant were better than the warriors bench guys.
"Preferably a Simmons type player. Even Jerami Grant would be good. If we could get Simmons, that would be a godsend considering we‚Äôve never had a wing/forward like Simmons. Under the right system he can help the team. It also implies we get rid of Stotts. Morey may end up trading Simmons at some point, and considering he‚Äôs been underwhelming in the playoffs, he could be moved if Philly screws up again."
leflop averages less free throws than jerami grant

"is it? just looking at old drafts i see guys like draymond green, khris middleton, spencer dinwiddie, will barton, jae crowder, jimmy butler, jerami grant, joe harris, malcolm brogdon, josh richardson, pascal siakam, dillon brooks, kyle anderson, etc, etc.. who were picked late that definitely improved from their rookie year to later career, and some of them were older when they were drafted too. dudes who prove themselves to be nba material will usually make some strides early in their career as they adjust to the speed and physicality of the nba. plus, having million dollar contracts on the line is a good incentive to hone your skills. i think the problem is that not many people in the 2nd round are nba material to begin with.  if youre talking about ""jumping tiers"" uhh sure, i dont think bane will be an all star, but there's enormous variance in the value of non all stars. if he can be even a top 100 player in the nba, how is that not a steal?  like half of the top 10 in a lot of drafts are busts.   also grayson was bad his rookie year, ask any jazz fan. true shooting percentage is 10% higher now with more volume and he can actually play defense. 40 pt game came on 11/30 shooting."
"Watching Jerami Grant, it's insane how much he's improved his game.  He could not create his own shot at all on the Thunder.  He's so good now."
"correct, no one in the $30M+ range is really on the market. i honestly think we don't make any big moves.  other warriors fans keep talking about a Beal trade, but i don't see it. he's on a path to the supermax, and honestly the fit with Steph and Klay only really makes sense if Klay is a shell of himself (in which case we're honestly just fucked and will need to seriously rethink everything). I've also heard people mention Porzingis (doesn't make sense, Mavs aren't blowing it up), KAT, and Pascal (those two are more reasonable, but I still don't see it).  Your last option is to trade them for multiple non-stars, which I like more (unless there's something I'm misunderstanding about the Warriors' cap situation). Wiggins + Wiseman is $40M/yr, so two $20M/yr players looks like Jerami Grant and Myles Turner, both currently on teams who are out of the playoffs (but again, I don't think they're actually on the market right now... just saying the sorts of players you'd look for)"
I'd give it to Randle. I didn't think he was capable of being this good.  The only other option is Jerami Grant but I'm not sure if they would award it to a player on such a horrible team.
Duck jerami grant. Knicks finally have an okay record . Meanwhile jerami grant is getting the Michael Carter Williams treatment. Inefficient af
"The other day I was thinking about what if Russ and Jerami never asked to be traded, but PG still wanted out, and then a year later we still traded Adams. This would have been the roster this year:  Russ//Dort//Shai//Grant//Horford  Maledon//Hill//Kenrich//Bazely//Roby  Moose//Moses//Svi  And then Gallo potentially could have stayed and also Hill for Tony Bradley could have still been a trade.   That's a complete ass roster with a ton of spacing around Westbrook."
Has to be... who else would even be a candidate? Jerami Grant?
I heard mfers saying Jerami Grant until the All Star break.  Ain't nobody taking MIP away from Julez. I will fucking riot otherwise.
"True story. He'd easily be number one on my Wizards. Sixers will be fun to watch they are really hungry this year.   Seems like the Sixers have a great eye for elite perimeter defenders (Iggy, Covington , Jrue Holiday, Matisse, Simmons, and even Jerami Grant )"
Nah we‚Äôll take jerami grant and let you guys develop wiseman as the next Giannis
Has to be the frontrunner. Respect to Jerami Grant but the step up Julius Randle has made this season is staggering.
"There might not be as many injuries total, but it certainly has affected a lot more star players than in the past, which is why people probably think there have been more injuries.  Not even done with the season yet and we have had Steph, LeBron, AD, Mitchell, Embiid, KD, Kyrie, Harden, Murray, Dinwiddie, LaMelo, Hayward, Lavine, Jerami Grant, Wiseman, Oubre, Klay, Eric Gordon, Myles Turner, Kawhi, Drummond, Oladipo, Mitchel Robinson, and SGA miss significant time."
"That 2014 draft has been quite the roller coaster.  A lot of hype early on, and then injuries and bad situations kind of tamped down expectations. But, now, a lot of those players have carved out really solid careers.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2014.html  Embiid, Julius Randle, Zach Lavine, Marcus Smart, and Aaron Gordon are the top 5 players from that lottery, and the 2nd round had Jokic, Jerami Grant, &amp; Spencer Dinwiddie...  So, potentially, the top 2 MVP candidates, and 4 all stars total from that draft this season. Pretty impressive. Just not who we expected them to be coming out...  Just goes to show you have to wait several years before truly judging a draft. But, we‚Äôll still judge anyway... üòí"
"PG: Gogan Dragic (offensive creator + shooting)  SG: Bradley Beal (shot making + primary ball handler)  SF: OG Anunoby (defends, shoots, and athletic)  PF: Jerami Grant (effective role player + two way)  C: Bam (same reasons as OP)"
I'm 5'9 and i got Jerami Grant
"Jerami Grant can defend and is producing more points at better efficiency on a worse team. I do think D'Lo's production is lower this season than you can expect for the rest of his career due to injury and weird team stuff, but they're similar on one side of the ball and not comparable on the other in Grant's favor."
Jerami Grant: 22.5/5/3 on 56% TS  D'lo: 19.5/2.6/5 (because he was forced to share the ball a lot with Rubio so his assists are down) on 55.5% TS  But when you compare the number of their assisted shots D'lo is at 33% for all of his shots and 50% on his 3's while Grant is at 66% for all of his shots and 93% for his 3's.  Their offensive game is not comparable at all.

At what? Defence and that's that.  Jerami Grant: 22.5/5/3 on 56% TS  D'lo: 19.5/2.6/5 (because he was forced to share the ball a lot with Rubio so his assists are down) on 55.5% TS  But when you compare the number of their assisted shots D'lo is at 33% for all of his shots and 50% on his 3's while Grant is at 66% for all of his shots and 93% for his 3's.

Jerami Grant AD and Bron would be stacked
"This sub keeps telling me Jerami Grant is a dogshit player for putting up similar numbers on a losing Pistons team and ""anyone could do that"" yet we are clamoring for Redd to be an all-star in the same exact situation?  He put up solid numbers on a losing team in 2006 and the Pistons were 42-9 at the break, how is that worthy of an All-Star appearance?"
This is the Jerami Grant effect.
"Jerami Grant would be the 2nd best player on the Wolves by a large margin lol, that's a major improvement over Jarred Vanderbilt or whoever"
"Damn. I wouldve loved to see Randle instead of KLove. Especially since Kev has been there and done that. Randle is the far better player these days. I don‚Äôt understand, even considering KLove‚Äôs experience.   Also how does Jerami Grant get the spot over Randle?"
I feel like it's actually Jerami Grant and Julius Randle that was more of the 50/50 decision
"Then why didn't they trade him? I'm not interested in rumors that were made up by journalists for clicks or front offices to drive hype... You're the Kings, you're rebuilding, you're offered solid young players/1sts for an older vet, why not take it?   Jerami Grant and TJ Warren were traded for cash. Oubre netted a late 1st&amp;2nd. Just a couple years ago Barnes himself was traded for Justin Jackson. This trade Haul you want for Barnes does not exist. You might get more if you wait."
"I'd take this package as a piston fan for Jerami Grant. I don't think the Raptors make this move as I think they are very close to the playoffs again being back in Toronto and adding a Suggs in the draft. The pistons, on the other hand, could greatly benefit from capitalizing on Grant's value while adding young assets. Mostly, I'd be excited about getting the 7th pick and potentially adding someone like Moses Moody."
Jerami Grant is the best player on a shitty team.
"Depends. For a team like the Raptors, they may want actual assets that add to a playoff push. So in that case, they‚Äôll want players more than a valuable pick. But, a team like the Pistons seems as it needs a true alpha (Jerami Grant is very good, but I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs the long term answer), so for them they would need 2-3 picks to move down. It‚Äôs situational imo."
"I'm all for a little ""back and forth"" but Jerami Grant actually went off during the bubble playoffs"
It's a dumb take to say that we don't know if Jerami Grant is just a good player on a bad team. He was important to the nuggets conference finals run last year and played better the later in the playoffs they got.
Jerami Grant made it to the WCF a year ago lol. He put up 26 points in their only win against the lakers.
I think honestly Jerami grant because he can be plugged into any team even though Ben is the better player.
Jerami Grant wouldn‚Äôt shoot 34% from the free throw line and average 10ppg in the playoffs as the ‚Äúsecond best player‚Äù on a team
"Honestly, Harrison Barnes.  He's a Jerami Grant-level player but Jerami Grant isn't going anywhere. If the Kangz get an opportunity to swap some of their treading-water talent with strong picks I think you do it."
"I‚Äôd rather the Warriors try to package both picks and Wiggins to get Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee or something. Why trade Wiggins for someone in a bigger contract, when you could get two contributors? They need depth."
"&gt; Grant played better &amp; went deep in the playoffs.  Alright now you need to calm down lol, Jerami has never been more than maybe a 4th option during a playoff run, ""he played better and went deep"" if Julius had the luxury of playing as the 4th option and had other superstars to carry him to deep in the playoffs then we could talk"
Congratulations to future Olympic Gold Medalist Jerami Grant.
FRAUD MIP Jerami Grant made it &amp; Julius didnt dkm ü§£
Jerami Grant would be ideal
"The Warriors looking for a big wing/forward certainly makes sense. If I were them my first choice is probably Jerami Grant, but I don't see the Pistons being all that motivated to move him. Siakam seems like a much more likely option as the Raptors can do a mini reset centered around Wiseman, #4, #7, OG, FVV and GTJ"
"Siakam or Jerami Grant at best. And this is not taking into how would the salary work, which they would need to trade Wiggins.. which those 3 are kinda all on the same tier and not really a big needle mover"
"Olympic athlete Jerami Grant is vet enough. üò§  Joking aside, that'd probably be something we would realistically need, but we have $0 this offseason thanks to us cutting Blake, so there's a chance we don't trade away some of our older guys.   We need to keep Jah around anyway so we can get the 1 next year too and draft Emoni Bates. /s"
"Jerami Grant, Malcolm Brogdon, Aaron Baynes, Taurean Prince. All those guys fetched protected FRPs in Sign &amp; Trade deals."
yeah jerami grant went and got a bunch of garbage time points while being down 20 points.
"Jerami Grant $19,047,000  Marcus Smart $13,446,000  Christian Wood $13,015,000  Spencer Dinwiddie $11,454,000  DeAndre Hunter $7,422,000  Succeeding is all relative obviously when you make the rule no all stars you can the ceiling at 5-6 seed type range."
"This is a new front office with weaver and his squad. So far he‚Äôs made great moves. And weaver decided rather than paying Christian wood who would bring us more wins, to pay jerami grant and replace him with Isaiah Stewart, both of which who play much better defense than wood"
"This is why I hate people who just point at stats and don't understand basketball.   You put DA on OKC and make him the focal point, feed him in the post the way Jokic and Embiid get fed, and Ayton will average 27/12/5. His efficiency would go down a bit, but he could do it easily. He's an underrated passer, very unselfish, doesn't rush when he gets double teamed. The NBA is as much about opportunity as anything else. Just ask somebody like Jerami Grant."
Jerami grant ain‚Äôt an all star player.
Time to recruit Jerami Grant
&gt;Capela went for that pick because the Rockets were desperate to try anything and their FO could see the writing on the wall.  The Timberwolves were willing to facilitate Covington leaving for that pick so you can look at it from that angle   &gt; I don‚Äôt think pick 22 is very valuable.  Jerami Grant went for a 1st *worse* than that the offseason and OKC was blowing it up. I've literally thrown millions of examples just for you to try to pick apart each one instead of understanding the point that picks have value based on precedence. You clearly are never going to agree. I could say 1+1=2 and you will find some way to pick it apart as opposed to re-evaluating your own heuristic.  &gt;I don‚Äôt understand what Kuz offers to any team besides rebuilding teams  Stop lookign at it what Kuz offers and look at it that a team can absorb a 13m contract if it gets them an extra shot at first round
Not just Ayton. Jerami Grant and John Collins are both significantly better than Love
"As a Pistons fan I finally have players that I want to keep around lol. As many suggested before, I would probably move the number down to 6 simply because so many teams don‚Äôt have 8 great players to keep around.  (2020-2021 roster) 1. Killian Hayes 2. Isaiah Stewart  3. Saddiq Bey 4. Mason Plumlee  5. Jerami Grant 6. Hamidou Diallo 7.  Sekou Doumbouya 8. Saben Lee  Obviously 1-6 isn‚Äôt in really any order, but keeping the starters and all one of the better bench players we‚Äôd be fine. Sekou would probably be taken due to potential, but it‚Äôd also depend on who else is taken. I don‚Äôt believe Saben Lee would be taken due to being a solid rookie but not great enough to warrant being picked."
"Without Luka on the court the Mavs have been: +0.4, +4.2, +0.3 in Net Rating in Luka's 3 years.. they're a .500 team without him. Hawks without Trae have been: -4.7, -12.9, -1.8. That's ... definitely not good!  I think there's decent 1:1 comps. Huerter-Brunson, DFS-Collins, Danilo-KP. Bogi-THJ. The benefit is that Trae's teammates are all super young (Hunter is missing the playoffs but he's a 15/5/2 on 60% TS guy), probably a bit better as shooters, and Trae has Capella instead of Boban/WCS/Powell/Maxi rotations. Luka is just a lot more ball dominant and I can't ever recall him playing off ball.  I think Luka's teammates are pretty good players and that's backed up by the stats. The ""get him some help"" crowd is being distracted by Luka's absurd usage this year (regular season and playoff leader). Reminds me of Westbrook's MVP year. In retrospect, Oladipo, Sabonis, Jerami Grant (who all played 1,500+ minutes on that OKC team) all became solid players when given opportunities.  KP falling from 16 FGA/G in the regular season (58% TS, 20 PPG) to 10 FGA/G (57% TS, 13PPG) says more about their playmaking/scheme than KP's scoring ability."
"I can't even think of a star that would even possibly be available who could  command Wiggins, Lamelo, 7, 14 in a trade. That's a Harden-esque package.   Maybe Wiggins, Lamelo, 7, 14 for Jerami Grant and 1st overall? Lol"
"Exactly, why suddenly do all these cleveland fans think Allen has gained so much value as if the 21st pick in the draft is underselling. Jerami grant was sold for a *worse* pick and he was considered a better player at the time."
32 points on literally over 25 fga per game (against LAC) lmaoooo. People trash Jerami Grant for doing shit like this on the pistons.
"Trade is possible, which is why I advocated for it, but you said they had cap space in FA. I'm sorry to tell you but Jerami Grant is probably as big a player as would come there in FA. Unless you are in LA, NY, Miami or you have anothet top 5 player you aren't really a FA destination for a top 20 guy in the league these days."
Give me Jerami Grant over a three late 1st round picks.
"There are a lot of young Black players like Jerami Grant &amp; Jaylen Brown who openly talk about wanting to be a part of an organization that values them as human beings, not just players. And guys like Jerami talk about how they want to be in Detroit because we have a Black GM &amp; Black Head Coach, and play in a Black city. We even have all Black beat writers.   Also, what has changed is that the franchise moved operations from Auburn Hills (a suburb with absolutely nothing around the stadium) to Downtown Detroit (which is buzzing with all major sports teams within walking distance and a robust food/music/art scene).   This is a new world. I don't anticipate someone like Lebron coming here. But a guy like Jaylen Brown wanting to be in Detroit? I could see it."
"Why exactly are the chances of landing a big name player ""slim to none""?  You can add a player via trade, not just free agency.   And frankly, this Pistons organization is building in a way that will make them an intriguing destination for players. They have a coach that players love, a GM who has great relationships with people across the league (part of why Jerami Grant came here), a young/hungry roster, an excited fanbase, etc."
"Yea here: https://ahnfiredigital.com/nba/celtics/report-boston-celtics-have-offered-detroit-pistons-multiple-first-round-picks-for-jerami-grant/  Grant is only 27 so idk what this whole timeline stuff is about. The average age of our starting lineup is 21 even with Grant, we need at least one vet out there to lead the young guys"
"The thing is it makes more sense to trade Jerami Grant than Cade since we are eating $30+ million in cap next year from Blake. If we can get another high pick or haul that would be great, but trading #1 for another big player while having a dead max slot for a year doesn't really make sense."
"&gt; he signed there because they offered the most money.  it's a little more nuanced than that   &gt; Grant, the player, wanted to show that he has more to offer. Grant, the Black man, wanted to play for people in leadership positions who look like him and share similar experiences. Before arriving in Detroit, he had never played for a Black head coach in the NBA. He had played previously under Weaver, though, who was Oklahoma City‚Äôs assistant GM during Grant‚Äôs 2016-19 tenure.    https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/#:~:text=Grant%2C%20the%20player%2C%20wanted%20to,head%20coach%20in%20the%20NBA."
That‚Äôs tru tbh. While I think saddiq bey would develop nicely into that model 3/D guy it ofc Jerami Grant and Cade is deadly
What's jerami grant contributing lol? You gotta have some end of bench guys
Please no I want to keep Jerami Grant.
Can‚Äôt believe Kevin Love and Jerami Grant ended up on team USA over Ayton and Zion.
"He won gold for them in 2012......and what ""merit"" did Jerami Grant have? because he dropped 20 on one of the worst teams in the league?"
"Why would the Pistons do this, they lose 27 year old Jerami Grant for 32 year old Bledsoe, who is a much worse player.  Just to take a flyer on a #10 pick who will be a crapshoot instead of proven commodity like Grant?  And Bledsoe is not cracking the Pistons starting lineup with Cade/Killian and won't even be a top player off their bench with Plumlee, Frank Jackson, Hamadou Diallo all above him...not too mention they need to give time to Sekou and Saben Lee, etc.  This trade makes the Pistons much worse."
I‚Äôd rather go for Jerami Grant tbh
"Jerami Grant, Beal, Draymond, Tatum, KD"
"This year it's closer, but I think there's decent 1:1 comps. Huerter-Brunson, DFS-Collins, Danilo-KP. Bogdan-THJ. The benefit is that Trae's teammates are all super young (Hunter is missing the playoffs but he's a 15/5/2 on 60% TS guy), probably a bit better as shooters, and Trae has Capella instead of Boban/WCS/Powell/Maxi rotations.  But overall, I think Luka's teammates are pretty good players and that's backed up by the stats. The ""get him some help"" crowd is being distracted by Luka's absurd usage this year (regular season and playoff leader). Reminds me of Westbrook's MVP year. In retrospect, Oladipo, Sabonis, Jerami Grant (who all played 1,500+ minutes on that OKC team) all became solid players when given opportunities."
"Percentage of passes that become assists, and passes to the interior being more valuable than passes to the 3 pt line is very dependent on context, including the personnel on the other side of the ball.  It's cool you found these stats but I just think they're too close to each other to really mean much. Trae has more consistent shooters so I would imagine there's often more space inside. Luka has a ""star"" ""power forward"" who refuses to post up.  I love Trae Young too and I really appreciate you using stats to talk about this stuff, I think ""playmaking ability"" is just really hard to isolate. By these stats, Jerami Grant probably looked like an elite playmaker this year."
"I appreciate your passion, it just seems to be driven by some unknown angry force. You're leaning very much into assumption on a lot of fronts here.  If you want to talk strictly population and Greater areas, sure, Detroit's numbers are solid, 11th largest in the USA as you mentioned; congrats.  In terms of NBA scope, I think it's fair to say Detroit is a small market in terms of media coverage, in terms of desirable play destination (the city), and in terms of individual player  and team marketing opportunity overall. The only reasons we see players go to Detroit is because the Pistons offer a sizeable and attractive contract (Ben Gordon, Charlie Villanueva, Josh Smith, Jerami Grant), or because they are traded there. Detroit offers nothing attractive otherwise. It's cold and fucking miserable half of the year.  I know the Pistons have an established and loyal fan base, but if anyone is delusional, it's you arguing Detroit is not a small market while sprinkling in nonsense points about my 5-word comment validating your theories."
"Hinkie would've definitely drafted Ben, but he would've also had better returns for Noel &amp; Okafor, as well as keeping Holmes &amp; Jerami Grant. He also wouldn't have traded up the 2018 draft because it meant parting with the BKN pick, though since the Celtics were set on drafting Tatum, Hinkie would've gotten Fultz anyway"
Don't sleep on Jerami Grant.
"If you give Luka Jamal Murray, Jerami Grant, MPJ, Millsap, Barton, Morris etc., I think he makes the WCF easy."
I was begging Detroit to get rid of Jerami Grant but he's a solid piece now.
"Detroit Pistons forward Jerami Grant has committed to Team USA for the Tokyo Summer Olympics, sources tell @me."
"Or Jrue holiday, Zach lavine, jerami grant, Kevin love, draymond green"
"Well they do have two all rookie guys this year, which is promising.  But if those guys don't keep improving then I wouldn't call them elite talents lol. They also unlocked a new level in Jerami Grant which is pretty cool, but he's not really ""young"".   I see what you mean when you say you want to see a few more years before you buy in. I just wanna be hype right now haha"
Fun to see some fresh faces. Wish we had a certified playmaker though. LeBron/CP3 esque.   Also Jerami Grant gettin the call! aw yeah.!
"As it says in the article,  &gt; They brought in a new front office last season led by GM Troy Weaver, a longtime Thunder executive who played a key role in their great drafts in the late 2000s. Everyone knew Kevin Durant would be a superstar. But it‚Äôs easy to forget that Russell Westbrook and James Harden were controversial selections at the time. Weaver showed that he‚Äôs willing to buck consensus when he signed Jerami Grant to a massive deal in free agency last summer, a move that was widely panned but now looks brilliant."
Damian Lillard / Jrue Holiday  Bradley Beal / Zach LaVine / Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum / Khris Middleton  Kevin Durant / Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo / Draymond Green / Kevin Love  Kind of an odd roster but they're so good it should still be a pretty easy job to get gold.
"Jerami Grant is not a role player in Detroit, he was nearly an all-star"
"im not trying to say there isn't luck involved. it's just that when you have a plan in place rather than ""we're gonna compete every ye- OH NO WE SUCK"" like the kings/wolves/whatever then you have to get lucky in a singular moment in order to compete. See Bucks with Giannis. See Jazz with Gobert. it's not impossible as obviously it happens.  if you plan your strategy around having 4-5 top picks then you increase your odds at getting lucky. that is the process. while you do this you go through as many players as you can to see who can stick in the NBA. Roco, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes.  so yes the sixers got lucky with embiid. but they also got SHAFTED with fultz. shafted with okafor. but because their strategy was to have multiple opportunities they've still come out with a competitive team despite making some poor decisions or having bad luck along the way."
"He did alright relative to the sheer volume of the ones they had. You just don't hear about the guys that didn't make it. The guys that did make it didn't make a big impact for the 76ers or net them a lot in trades. RoCo was a big part of the Butler trade, so that's probably the one you'd make an exception for (which wasn't a Hinkie move). That's a big reason 2nd round picks/undrafted players aren't that valuable. Even the ones that do develop are going to take a long time, at which point odds are good they're on a new team already.   Was Jerami Grant a nice pick? Yeah, no doubt. Was he a homerun? Ehh, more like a double, two picks after him the Nuggets drafted the most recent MVP.  Richaun Holmes is a guy in the League... he wasn't always that, by the time the new 76ers regime gave up on him they got Cash Considerations."
Kevin Love and Jerami Grant?  This isn‚Äôt the dream team.
Zion probably didn‚Äôt want to go. No way they actually wanted Kevin Love and Jerami Grant over him.
Let‚Äôs goooooo. Love me some Jerami Grant
"I could see the Warriors going all in.   Warriors get:   * Jerami Grant   * Cade Cunningham  Pistons get:   * James Wiseman   * Jordan Poole   * Eric Paschall  * Filler contracts (Mulder, Smailagic)  * 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st   Warriors go all in on winning. Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Looney, Cade/Oubre/Grant/Juan/Chriss   Pistons turn one pick and one good player into three blue chip prospects and four first round picks, two of which are for sure lotto picks and one (2025) that will likely be a lotto pick as well once Steph, Klay, Dray age out  Look at it as Wiseman, #7, #14 to move up to #1. Then Poole, Paschall, filler, 2 1sts for Grant."
"Missing our borderline all star Jerami Grant! Our defence under Casey has looked so good honestly, and our entire starting lineup is taller than 6‚Äô6 with long ass wingspans, extremely switchable."
"Yea I agree and honestly I‚Äôve maintained the position that Green has higher potential than Cade. But Cade‚Äôs got that ‚Äúit‚Äù factor, we finally have a guy to build around, and it ain‚Äôt Jerami Grant lol"
The Pistons have no Devin Booker or anyone remotely close to as promising. Their current franchise player is a 27-year-old Jerami Grant. They should take the best player available and not think twice.
"I mean, Pistons potential roster in 2-3 years:  G/W Killian Hayes  G/W Cade Cunningham  W/F Jerami Grant  W/F Saddiq Bey  F/C Isaiah Stewart   Bench:  G/W Hamidou Diallo  G Saben Lee  W/F Deividas Sirvydis  W/F Sekou Doumbouya   Plus any other draft picks or FA signings. I like that roster, tbh"
"Not like this. This is just silly, and that‚Äôs completely ignoring that Jerami Grant isn‚Äôt the magic elixir to make the Warriors title contenders again.  He‚Äôs a marginal upgrade in the short-term and probably a net negative in the long-term, depending on one‚Äôs opinion of Wiseman."
I‚Äôm ‚Äúhuffing and puffing‚Äù about trade value because I don‚Äôt think Jerami Grant is good enough a player to warrant completely ignoring the cost.  He‚Äôs not on that ‚Äúacquire by all means necessary‚Äù level.
I dont think he's a non-asset. I think he's worth a 1st round pick in a vacuum. If I were the Celtics I would have traded # I think Jerami Grant is worth 2 1st round picks which is what this offer is equivalent to
You‚Äôre on fucking crack to think Jerami fucking Grant is worth that much lol
Christian Wood and Jerami Grant are great targets for them. Wiseman and their two picks this year are good enough assets to get it done
"Seems a little odd to exclude the best players on each team (i.e. Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Pascal Siakam) if you're asking to rank the teams"
https://hoopshype.com/rumor/celtics-offered-multiple-first-round-picks-for-jerami-grant/  I think you are underrating how the league values Grant
"That is a massive overpay for Jerami Grant my guy. He‚Äôs really not that much better than Kelly Oubre, so to attach a 2nd overall pick/#14th on top of that is wild."
"Wood wanted to leave, and we needed the money to pay Jerami Grant who‚Äôs better anyways.   Plumlee just had a career year, with two triple doubles, and will be flipped on draft night."
"Wood was already gone, the Pistons signed Plumlee after it was already obvious that Wood was gone.   This Pistons management also got Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart with 16th and 19th pick (two all rookie guys), a breakout ""borderline"" all star in Jerami Grant, Hamidou Diallo by giving up Svi Mkhyaluak (idk how to spell it), Josh Jackson for only 5 million (averaged 14 and 4), and Saben Lee in the second round (averaged 6 and 4 in low minutes off the bench).   I'd say they've done fine."
It‚Äôs pretty incredible how good of a situation were in now even with all of colangelos fuck ups. There‚Äôs a realistic scenario where are roster layout rn is nearly identical except we add Jerami Grant (traded for Ilyasova) and Tatum (Fultz trade). That‚Äôs not including the misses in the draft where he picked guys in the 1st round who never even came to the US. And the impact his ‚Äòguys‚Äô in the front office had who hung around and ran things until Morey came.
"Obviously a reactionary take, but I was thinking this morning that if the Pistons had Haliburton instead of Hayes then they'd be beyond set.  Haliburton/Cade/Saddiq Bey/Jerami Grant/Isiah Stewart - that's a ridiculous small ball lineup."
"Detroit's 2 best players last season (Jerami Grant &amp; Saddiqq Bey) are their starting forwards. They had Wayne Ellington starting for a while but Josh Jackson &amp; Hamidou Diallo will likely fight that spot this season.   Like, just like your team has set things up for Markelle Fultz to be ""The Man"", Cunningham will definitely be the lead guard for the Pistons."
"Obviously a reactionary take, but I was thinking this morning that if the Pistons had Haliburton instead of Hayes then they'd be beyond set.  Haliburton/Cade/Saddiq Bey/Jerami Grant/Isiah Stewart - that's a ridiculous small ball lineup."
"Pistons need to move on from this entire look. The Ben Wallace/Chauncey/Rip Hamilton era has been over for long time now. It's not always good to hold on to the past.  With the #1 Pick coming in, Jerami Grant finally leveling up, with other great young pieces like Bey &amp; Stewart on the squad it's time to change things up and give these guys their own look. Let these guys leave own mark instead of chasing ghosts of the past."
"That's such a cool lineup, their young core is all 6'7 (Bey) and 6'8 (Stewart, Cade) but with vastly different still sets, then add in Killian Hayes who's got a 6'8 wingspan and 6'8 Jerami Grant..  I just think it's neat."
"So with Detroit getting Cade, will Jerami Grant demand to leave so he can go be the guy somewhere else?"
I wonder if there is a Warriors - Pistons trade for Jerami Grant that could work for one of your lottery picks. Maybe Oubre and 14 or Oubre and 7 depending on what Grant's value is.
Horford is old and we were trying to trade him so why would we risk him getting hurt. Jerami grant missed like 35 games with a ‚Äúsore knee‚Äù
"Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee  Corey Joseph, Josh Jackson, Hami Diallo, Sekou Doumbouya, Isaiah Stewart  Is this likely what you guys will look like? Or do you think a few players might be moved? Ala Plumlee and Joseph."

"Until we see what Isaac looks like I‚Äôm gonna have to say Jerami, but if we‚Äôre talking pre-injury then give me Jon any day of the week. A DPOY-level player that really started to show flashes of his offensive potential before that unfortunately injury  Grant had a really shitty second half to the season. Whether that‚Äôs due to injury, having to deal with defenses focusing on him, or a bit of both (most likely) isn‚Äôt clear, but I‚Äôm not 100% sold on him as ‚Äúthat‚Äù guy"

Yessir we need Detroit winning again man. That‚Äôs a great basketball city &amp; has too much history for them not to be winning. I hope Cade adds to that legacy. I also hope Kuzma gets to add to it as well when the Lakers come off him for Jerami Grant.
Or‚Ä¶ their two All-Rookie team rookies and last year‚Äôs #7 pick AND Jerami Grant
Pistons up next they already have a good young core plus Jerami Grant üëÄ
Jerami Grant?
"It‚Äôs not even just that.  Our stars played like Kentucky Fried Ass.    Kevin Durant, who is hailed as the most unstoppable scorer on the planet, shot 30% from the field against guys who wouldn‚Äôt be dominant in the NCAA.  Bradley Beal, the man who until the last game of the season was giving Stephen Curry a run for his money for the scoring title, shot **14%** from the field.   I didn‚Äôt even know that was possible.  I assumed that if you shot that bad they just stopped counting like Warriors fans do with Draymond, who incidentally was one of the only players who didn‚Äôt play like they wanna be waived next season.    Jerami Grant, 6 points on 6 shots, but I don‚Äôt count him because who the fuck even is this guy and why did he play the same amount of minutes as Bam Adebayo?  If they don‚Äôt put on some Dream Team level shit in the olympics, they along with Popovich should be walking home.  From Tokyo.  Through the ocean."
Heavy on strategically subbing out the greatest roster assembled. Subbing out Larry Bird for Scottie Pippen is a whole different level compared to subbing out Durant for Saddiq Bey or Jerami Grant lmao
https://twitter.com/boardroom/status/1407842645737619459?s=21  Lavine and Lillard are Adidas  Draymond is Converse   Jerami Grant doesn‚Äôt have one.   Everybody else is Nike/Jordan.
"You‚Äôre speaking as if it‚Äôs Bucks-Suns, like it‚Äôs an NBA game. This is USA vs Nigeria. Your ‚Äòbench unit‚Äô isnt really a bench unit they‚Äôre supposed to be starters 1B. They‚Äôre not supposed to just have ‚Äògood plus minus‚Äô they‚Äôre supposed to be capable of blowing out the competition just as much as the starters (and if the starters can‚Äôt). Draymond Green and Jerami grant? Lol. In years past that would be Chris Bosh and Dwayne wade, or Carmelo Anthony and Paul George."
"Man, no üòÇ Coaching doesn‚Äôt matter in the Olympics my guy, and neither does ‚Äúone of the greatest defenders ever‚Äù. It‚Äôs the Olympics not a gutsy 50 win team.   This team is one of the worst and people who know better said as much 2-3 weeks ago. Olympic teams are supposed to be stacked. People like Jrue holiday, Jerami grant, Kevin love at this stage, draymond green‚Äî-yes, draymond green‚Äî-traditionally wouldn‚Äôt even make a national team.  And no facilitating PGs. The other bad national team? 2004. AI and Marbury. No traditional, facilitating PG. You need that and every team but 2004 has had that.   2016- Lowry   2012- CP3, Deron  2008- CP3, Deron, J Kidd  2000- J Kidd, Payton   1996- Stockton, Payton   1992- Stockton, Magic"
I don‚Äôt think Jerami Grant knew that lol. There was a play where Nigeria missed a shot and Grant was waiting to grab the rebound as it bounced a couple times and a Nigeria player came out of nowhere and tipped it in. You could see on the replay he looked pretty annoyed lol
"Nobody on earth can defend choosing jerami grant over Randle, Randle beat him out in every single category this year, even though jerami played on a shit team and was gunning for the  MIP all season."
"Yeah but what does having 6 of the same player on the team do. Westbrook is washed but is a gold medalist and can direct the offense. Randle is simply more size that can score at 6‚Äô8  260 or whatever   Booker, Middleton, lavine, and Beal are the exact same player.   Meanwhile, we have 1 big scorer outside of KD in jerami grant who isn‚Äôt even that good? And we have 1 center in Bam?   Past Olympic teams always had a diverse array of players, no 2 players did the same thing. It‚Äôs just a shame is all"
"Grant is the better defender and he‚Äôs friends with Dame &amp; KD that‚Äôs why he was brought on. If anything replace that bum K Love not Grant, Jerami was one of their better players tonight"
Jerami Grant should‚Äôve been swapped out with Jarrett Allen
USA deserves this for being arrogant enough to waste roster spots on Kevin Love and Jerami Grant
Jerami Grant on the roster is also a head scratcher. But tbh I‚Äôm pretty happy about it with so many top players at home. Would be very fun to actually have a competitive Olympic tournament
Jerami Grant isn‚Äôt the caliber of player that should be repping USA basketball
Bums like Jerami Grant and Darius Garland repping USA makes me sad
Jerami Grant just iced out Kevin Durant
"Can you read? I already pointed out that Grant's TS% is 10 percentage points better over the last 5 years. I mean sure it was 0.5% lower last year when he was the #1 option on the worst team in the league, but I certainly wouldn't argue someone is a more efficient player based on a few tenths of a percent over one season.  &gt;You've provided no reason to believe that Jerami is more efficient   Your reading comprehension is terrible; I never claimed Grant was more efficient. They've been about the same over the years."
Jerami grant probably better than Dirk too if we being honest
I could say the same about the Pistons.  I know Jerami Grant and that's it.
With Jerami Grant and Christian Wood coming off the bench.
Wait.....Jerami Grant? We talking about the Jerami Grant that was on the Process team? He makes close to max Now?  I stopped watching NBA for a few months and what the fuck happened.
And you can argue jerami grant is a better player than Tobias Harris
Jerami Grant makes 20m a year.   Tobias Harris makes 37m a year.   Jerami is not close to a max.
"Jerami grant is the best player on the pistons and he makes close to the max already, jrue has a max contract."
"40% from 3 is borderline elite, and sure you can say that he gets open looks that the defense concedes to him but his stroke has improved each year so pretty soon he figures to be a sniper from distance, and dudes that can do that get PAID.  Also Collins can drive &amp; create his own shot closer to the basket, he's an efficient scorer and has made some improvements on defense.  In a world where guys like Gallo and Jerami Grant get $20M/year Collins is going to get his &amp; he should.  Collins isn't even 24 yet and has improved each season, he's far more deserving of a fat contract than a lot of guys that get them."
The hornets had vets. Rozier closed games and they were good with Hayward (tanked after he got hurt).  The pistons have jerami grant and mason plumlee LOL
"Because it‚Äôs not hard to be the best player on the pistons, someone‚Äôs gotta score the points it‚Äôs kinda like people thinking that Julius Randle is actually a star.  Jerami Grant is a career 10/3/1 player‚Ä¶"
Equally amazed by Jerami Grant lol
Ahh it is Jerami Grant. I think he is built for the international game. I didn't realize he made the team though.
"Oh I get all that, I'm just pointing out that if he is making the same or more than Jerami Grant or Brogdon, he got overpaid."
"Jerami Grant will make 20 Million this upcoming year. Jackson had a great playoff run but you're talking about giving 20+ mil to a 31 year old PG who averaged 10/3/3 last year. He can shoot the 3, but he is just a role player."
I agree he‚Äôs kinda in a inconsistent role but Idt he can average 25 ppg and be an all star player on a winning team. Maybe he can do the jerami grant thing and put up 20 ppg on a shitty team that wins like 25 games. If he proves me wrong then I‚Äôll apologize
"25 is high, but tbh a lot of nba guys could put up gaudy numbers if they‚Äôre given enough usage. Swap him with Jerami Grant this year and he probably averages about 20"
"I completely disagree with that. He‚Äôs basically saying give me the ball a lot otherwise I can‚Äôt be good. NBA players who aren‚Äôt stars need to learn how to contribute in different ways as needed.  All the genuine scorers can come off the bench whenever and get buckets. You could even pick up Michael Beasley off the street and he will get you buckets first game, don‚Äôt matter if he play 0 minutes one game and 30 the next. Kuzma isn‚Äôt even that and he talking about 25 ppg All Star. Learn to be good in your role first (like Jerami Grant) or you don‚Äôt deserve that opportunity one but."
Kuzma for Jerami Grant confirmed
Jerami grant is a lot younger and more of a two way player though. He was going to get paid either way last year.
"I believe it. We saw what happened with Jerami Grant who was barely a 3rd option on the Nuggets and just averaged 22pts on the team with the #1 pick. Question is who wants Kuzma? At least with Grant, you saw some great defense in the playoffs the year before. With Kuzma, you saw a lot of Shaqtin plays"
"Okay three things mate:  1. It does NOT have to be Detroit or Miami, those were just places off the top of my head who may be in need of a point guard. 2. Three team trades exist. Cleveland does NOT have to gain a good 3 or 4 from Miami or Detroit. They can send a player there and get a player from somewhere else. 3. Jerami Grant  Gotta think outside the box for a half a second sometimes."
No Jerami Grant slander will be tolerated. He was the best player on my favorite team so he deserves respect üò§üò§üò§
Jerami Grant duh
They better stay away from Jerami Grant
"Weaver  It‚Äôs been known he‚Äôs got an eye for talent (drafted Westbrook, Harden, Adams, SGA, and more), and in just one season in Detroit he‚Äôs got everything turned around to where we actually show promise.   Saddiq and Beef Stew look like steals from last draft. Believed in Jerami Grant and he‚Äôs played above his contract. Gave Frank Jackson a chance and he started looking like a potential 6man candidate towards the latter portion of the season. Not even to mention we got the first pick.  I trust him"
"You forgot Beef Stew and Bey. Jerami Grant is as good as BI, but $100m cheaper. And Detroit is a much better, more livable city than New Orleans."
"Cuz new Orleans actually has good players like Ingram, Adams and Zo? Detroit literally just has Jerami Grant"
"BI and Jerami Grant are pretty much even, and Grant is $100m cheaper."
"I'm partial to the fact that MJ wore #9 in the Olympics and my guy Jerami Grant is going to wear #9, which is cool because it's also his number on the Pistons. For some reason it's really satisfying to me when guys in the Olympics get to wear their regular jersey number, lol."
"1) Re-Sign Curry no matter what  2) Bring back Klay ASAP  3) Trade this years picks no matter what. I don‚Äôt want to see the Warriors wasting time trying to develop young players. In order, try for:   - Paul George if the Clippers blow it up - Pascal Siakam  - Jerami Grant  - TJ Warren  - Dillion Brooks"
"lol well if your position is trade CJ for Butler then sure, you've solved your problem. But you're not getting Butler. CJ's efficiency isn't astronomical because he's bad at getting to the line, agree with you there. If he could average 6 FTs a game he'd be a true star but he's not explosive or big enough. But his offensive impact is very very good. Look at any on/off, +/-, WAR, etc. stat you want. He's up there with elite guys.  If you think you're replacing that with Norm or someone of his caliber bc you had a stretch where Lillard had to kill himself to keep the team afloat without CJ, good luck. The benefit of CJ is he can give Lillard a break. Get rid of CJ and you'll have no secondary ballhandler or scoring option. Dame's not scoring 40 a night all season. He can do that in stretches to cover for guys, but it's not going to work long-term.  And this is the problem with CJ trades: you can keep braying on about how he's not good enough and should go, but what are you getting back? Replacing him with cheap parts, which is really the only option most people see, isn't going to help the team. You're looking at Harrison Barnes, Josh Richardon/Maxi Kleber type deals. Maybe Jerami Grant, probably not. Good luck with Ben Simmons lol.  And part of ""showing up"" is being productive in the regular season. It's hilarious that people reduce players to playoff losses. How do you think teams get to the playoffs? CJ's been a huge part of keeping the Blazers highly competitive year in and year out with very few quality players around him and Dame.  CJ isn't a good defender, but he's not the reason the entire team stinks on that end. What the Blazers need is to not play the worst defenseive bench imaginable: Simons, Melo and Kanter. That's what sunk the team in the playoffs. They were beyond awful. Totally unplayable. Abused by other starters and backups. Flipping at least two of those guys out for quality rotation pieces who can offer even marginal defensive resistance improves the Blazers significantly. You can't have Paul Millsap destroying you in the playoffs at like 37. That's where I'd start this offseason."
"Jerami Grant was not shooting the way he is now and is probably going to look for more money, Bobby Portis is playing on a championship team and could easily get paid more, but some players thrive off of bench roles and taking the back seat so idk but Myles Turner is definitely the best non-rookie contract in the NBA. But again, John Collins is 23 and you pay for potential as well when dealing with a player like that. He can very possibly get better at a lot of things considering his age and the current coaching staff"
Jerami Grant? It‚Äôs funny because presti copied that for Dort and Moses brown as well lol
Someone‚Äôs been talking to Jerami Grant
"For instance, Miles Turner, who's been shopped all over the league @ 17 Mil.  Bobby Portis who's only getting paid like 3.6 Mil or Jerami Grant who's only on a 3 yr 60 Mil deal. or Robert Covington ,etc etc etc."
"Duncan is one of the most disrespected stars of the game (by casuals). I think people here only saw him play from 2010 afterwards where the Spurs transitioned to a ball movement, guard led offense. They talk about how his ceiling wasn't that high like he didn't win b2b MVPs in like his 3rd and 4th year in the league.   I think he's ranked appropriately and people just kinda give him a nod in the top 10, but i think people really underestimate how dominant he was because he wasn't flashy  1) Duncan was the fucking system till like 2007. [1] Look at this 42-15 run the Spurs had against the Mavs in game 6 in 2003. Nearly every basket is created because of how much attention the Mavs are giving Duncan. They're doubling him off ball which basically lets the other players get open looks.   2) Duncan really elevated his game in the playoffs. His PER and advanced stats actually GO UP in the playoffs (Kobe's goes down for example).   3) That 03 team really should put Duncan above any KG/Kobe comparisons. He beat a team with prime shaq and prime kobe with his 2nd best player being a 38 year old DRob? A sophomore Tony Parker who would get benched for bobby jackson?   4) His offense was better than KG for getting a go to basket in the clutch. This is just something that's more subjective, but even though Giannis gets way more points than Duncan, who would you rather have the ball in the last 5 mins of the game?   5) People also don't take into consideration pace. They see his scoring and think ""oh 23 ppg, that's like what Jerami Grant averaged ""...Spurs won games like 85-75 back in the day, not 120-114. Duncan is obviously no Kobe when it comes to scoring load, but he's actually much closer to Kobe than most people would realize when you see what % of a team's total he scored (so if you equate 20 points in a 80 point game to 25 points in a 100 point game)   [1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO4caOwS6jI"
That‚Äôs Olympian Jerami Grant sir
&gt;Sitting but not trading Tyreke Evans while he was averaging 20/5/5 on a team that was tanking.  Real Jerami Grant hours
jerami grant
That‚Äôs borderline all-star Olympian Jerami Grant sir üò§
"Jerami Grant is a good player, and he did his job well on the Nuggets imo"
Jerami Grant
High counting stats on bad team due to inflated usage plus bad defense sometimes.   Usually the kind of player who would average worse PTS/REB/AST in a winning team or a system that maximizes each player‚Äôs talents.  Look at Jerami Grant on the pistons for example. If you dropped him back in Denver he would go right back to averaging what he averaged last year.
"D'angelo Russell pick any year, even his make-a-wish all star season with the Nets  Andre Drummond entire career  Whiteside in portland  Jerami grant this year  Sexton this year"
"A solid handle is a big difference maker, like I said it's a big if but some team might back themselves to get more out of him.     Who would have guessed Jerami Grant would grow like he did?"
"Jerami Grant will make it over Warren, no bias"
"I mean, Saddiq Bey and Jerami Grant was a cute story but that team truly sucked shit and they had a winning percentage of .277 for a reason. There was not a lot of reason to be optimistic there, but Cade completely changes that."
"Not specific users, but Jerami Grant being trashed so hard was a surprise. Have also seen you guys trash Orlando, Detroit, AG, Barton, Beasley and Nurkic but Grant really stood out, despite leaving on pretty amicable terms.  I remember he struggled in the first couple games for Detroit and y'all top threads were basically just jeering at him for daring to leave Denver for a bigger role. It's weird bc I haven't seen Denver fans act like that in r/nba."
"This rebuild feels different in Detroit. Jerami Grant had a breakout season, 2 NBA all rookie guys drafted last year plus Killian Hayes, and now Cade Cunningham. Crazy things happen but I don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôre not a playoff team within a couple seasons."
Jerami Grant made some crazy strides though. It's been incredible watching him become a top-40 level player from a defensive specialist.
"It's like how Jerami Grant scored like 22 a game this year, or something like that. These are all NBA level players. Given minutes, they can all light it up"
Y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt ready when Olympian Jerami Grant is unleashed
1. PG  2. Khris Middleton  3. Rashard Lewis w/ worse defense  4. Jerami Grant  5. Bam  6. Derozan  7. Baby Harden
Jerami Grant is not a role player anymore. The Detroit Pistons are his team
2022 - Jerami Grant    2023 - Killian Hayes  2024 - Cade Cunningham  2025 - Isiah Stewart    2026 - Mason Plumlee    2027 - Dwane Casey (player coach)
"It's this one. I saw an article that tries to make guesses on how Hinkie would've ran things if he was forced out and holy shit did Colangelo royally fuck things up.  1) The moment Hinkie finally sees Embiid play, you just know he'll be more aggressive in shopping Noel &amp; Okafor, as well as getting better returns.  2) He definitely doesn't trade Jerami Grant for Ilyasova, nor would he let Richaun Holmes leave for nothing.  3) He wouldn't trade up the draft to take Fultz #1 while giving up the BKN pick; He would draft Fultz at #3 and let the Celtics get their guy Tatum at #1  4) If Fultz still messes up his shoulder, Hinkie handles that better than Colangelo did and probably even trades him ahead of time. He also doesn't trade Mikael Bridges pick for Zhaire Smith.  5) Imagine the Sixers if Hinkie drafts Sexton with that BKN pick, then still trades for Butler and Harris with the same assets, or gets a better return for Fultz. You still get Sexton-Butler-Simmons-Harris-Embiid with Redick, Bridges, McConnell, Holmes, and Jerami Grant off the bench  6) I imagine before the 2019 season, Hinkie moves on from Brett. If not, he definitely chooses Butler over Brett   Colangelo fucked up the Process. Elton Brand put the final nail in the coffin. Morey is now trying to fix the mess they made."
"Do you think Hinkie parts with Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Richuan Holmes for nothing?  Do you think he gets more value for Okafor after his good rookie season...look what he did with ROY MCW.  Do you think he trades SAC 1st to move #3 to #1 to draft Fultz?"
"And we traded away Jerami Grant for Ilyasova for no reason other than to win 3 more games in a non contending season. Fultz, Zhaire Smith, and Ersan an could‚Äôve very easily been Tatum, Mikal Bridges, and Jerami Grant. We hit on just one of those and it could‚Äôve been the difference in a championship run."
"I'm just saying that it's tough to call that a failure of the process when it was the post-Hinkie FO that let a lot of those guys go for a bunch of win now moves. For example, trading Jerami Grant for a one year rental of Ersan was incredibly short sighted"
Nothing but all stars and jerami grant
Jerami Grant
"Some guys are definitely empty stats players though. For instance Malik Beasley and Jerami Grant. They‚Äôre great guys for tanking but if they put up 20 ppg on ‚Äúcontending‚Äù teams, those teams wouldn‚Äôt actually be contenders anymore."
Jerami grant gives really visually appealing dunks
"You have to assume in these trade scenarios that the team trading for Ben believes he's better than that complete collapse we all watched over the last couple games.    I mean, this was also [just last season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbezMUTAtg8)  Not saying I'm a complete believer, but there's been wilder turnarounds in NBA history.  I (and a lot of other people in this subreddit) were completely wrong about Jerami Grant last offseason."
"I could see him getting a Jerami Grant type deal. But you‚Äôre right, the Knicks already paid him $15 million, but for just one year.   Financially speaking, he‚Äôd be a fool to opt into his deal next year. He will very likely have a few multi-year offers. Even if a team offers him half of what Grant makes per year, so $10 million, he‚Äôd still be making almost three times as much as what he‚Äôd get by opting in."
"I hate these stupid takes. If anything this season has shown it has shown that it‚Äôs very possible for once overlooked talent to show dramatic improvement at age 25 or 26. As a Warriors fan you should automatically agree to this after a year of Wiggins, but there‚Äôs also Julius Randle, Zach LaVine (he‚Äôs been balling for a while now but this year was undeniable), Christian Wood, Chris Boucher, Jerami Grant, etc."
Jerami Grant
"Sabonis, Brogdon, and Levert for Ben Simmons and Jerami Grant?  Three studs for two who are not?  I mean theyre good, but not even close to enough and it's a terrible way to start a rebuils that's not necessary in the first place."
"I‚Äôm real high on Maxey and Tisse ofc but that‚Äôs about it. I sorta see Maxey as being a Kyle Lowry but better (dont know if that‚Äôs a lowball or not) and I don‚Äôt know Mattise‚Äôs ceiling until he gets a reliable shot of any kind.   Besides them we don‚Äôt really got anybody else. There *are* no stars on the roster aside from Jo, so we can‚Äôt trade Ben or Tobias for High picks. Top 15 for either of them would be generous and the only way id see it happening is if a real contender thought that one of them could put em over the hump and were in possession.  No disrespect to yur Cavs I just don‚Äôt see them having particularly *great* things ahead :(. Collin is awsome, garland is good, and Cedi is cool. Fro too. But none of them strike me as guys that can put you into the top eight. With Mo-town, Jerami Grant while not really ‚Äúyoung‚Äù is a player who‚Äôs proven he can keep himself within a deep playoff team rotation and Killian Hayes is too fresh to say anything about. Ln top of that they‚Äôll go number 1. Who knows what Cade‚Äôll be"
"I've always said that Olshey is extremely high variance, but he really only has one gear.  Drafting Dame, getting Nurkic + pick for Mason Plumlee, getting great value on the Aminu &amp; Ed Davis contracts after LMA left, finding Moe Harkless on the scrap heap, drafting CJ (even though it was ahead of Giannis) and finding GTJ were all good/great moves.     Handing out $200M of contracts to shitty players after a fool's gold playoff run was awful.  Trading up for Zach Collins was a huge swing &amp; miss, same with Anfernee Simons.  Not being willing/able to get a RoCo like player 2 years earlier to help Dame &amp; CJ when they really needed it and not doing more to remake the roster around them when they had a chance hurt.  Like, imagine a world where Olshey cashes in on Harkless &amp; Crabbe when their contracts were up instead of shelling out huge $$$ to them, or one where instead of trading up for John Collins he holds at 15 and takes OG Anunoby or John Collins instead, then uses the 2 other picks the Blazers had in that draft to get off their toxic deals instead of taking Biggie Swanigan.  Or what if he just took GTJ in the first over Simons (Jalen Brunson was also available here), then they'd still have him on a rookie contract for one more season &amp; wouldn't be staring down giving him Jerami Grant $$$ this offseason.  Sometimes making moves to take useful/immediate impact players over tantalizing upside projects is the right move, doubly so when you already hit home runs with Dame, CJ &amp; Nurkic.     Contrast some of the Olshey moves with the Suns: they took Mikal Bridges &amp; Cam Johnson in the draft &amp; got criticized for it because those guys were older and profiled more as complimentary pieces than prospects with star potential.  But guess what, the Suns already had their star in Devin Booker, so they made moves to surround him with useful pieces that compliment his skillset.  Also while those guys are older for draft prospects, they're in the same age range as Booker &amp; Ayton so it's not really so bad to fill out a roster with guys that have bankable skills &amp; fit that timeline.  Once Olshey had Dame, he should've done everything possible to maximize the window he had to build the perfect team around him.  Not like Dame was a late bloomer, he was clearly the dude as soon as he came into the NBA.  Instead, he kept taking home run swings to try &amp; find more upside (Collins &amp; SImons, two projects that did not project as immediate contributors when drafted).   You have to be willing &amp; able to shift gears as a GM."
"When you say shipped out, you mean traded for assets, right? Saric + Roco became jimmy butler. Jerami Grant became the pick that turned into Maxey. Etc"
"I had Jerami Grant there before, but took him out when because I already had Malcolm Brogdon and Lonzo.   Dragic is a fine point guard imo unless he fell off a cliff and I didn‚Äôt notice.  Caris Levert is a great offensive player and is solid on defense.  Bobby portis was just there for spacing and defense, but I‚Äôd probably have Jerami Grant there instead.   Turner is there for his elite rim protection that would allow the rest of the team to be aggressive on defense. After watching how bad the Pacers were without him, it made me realize how much he elevates a defense.   I think it would make the playoffs, but I understand if you think it couldn‚Äôt. I disagree that BI couldn‚Äôt be the best player on a playoff team though."
"I don‚Äôt think so, at least not from the fan perspective.  For me personally, and for a lot of other die-hard Sixer fans, the Process years were great.  I enjoyed those teams so much more than the years of consistently finishing 7th-10th in the East and knowing we were never going to contend to win a championship, and never going to draft high enough to draft a truly impact player.  At least with the Process year, I had zero expectations and I wasn‚Äôt getting my heart broken by being let down over unrealistic expectations.  It was also great watching lightly heralded players such as Robert Covington, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, etc turn into quality NBA players."
"they clearly did develop talent? see Richaun Holmes, Robert Covington, Christian Wood(kind of), Ish Smith, Jerami Grant, Saric, Embiid, TJ McConnell  &amp; i remember point guards Isaiah Canaan, Ish Smith, TJ McConnell, MCW and Tony Wroten.   i understand you don‚Äôt like the process but what you just said clearly wasn‚Äôt true. Okafor has proven to be a bust on multiple teams, Noel never developed to his potential on multiple teams either. don‚Äôt act like this is strictly a sixers thing"
"Much better is a little bit of a stretch. The year he had PG was comparable to a Kawhi-less Clippers. Russ had PG, Steven Adams, Schroder, Jerami Grant, etc. Losing in 5 to the Blazers was pretty bad. Also Russ played on other teams besides OKC.  I agree though that at times people are overly harsh towards Russ. Dude plays his ass off. But I also get why people get frustrated by his shooting.   PG might shoot inefficiently for a stretch, but at least it‚Äôs a player who is a good shooter. Russ has never been one."
"Orlando Serge trade was still so weird, but if you thought he'd be like Jerami Grant is in Detroit now it makes some sense. Still though. He never became that."
"you know hinkie had a 5-7 year plan to be contenders right? in 2016-17 the roster included dario, covington, jerami grant, embiid, simmons, TJ, and richaun holmes. and an absolute FUCKTON of capspace. well before colonjello got his hands on it anyways.  that team started 0-7 and then went to 17-27. without ben simmons. all he had to do was bide his time and let his guys develop... you know like he always planned.  &gt;you think hinkie would‚Äôve made the same moves the Colangelos did before that season?  what moves did colangelo make before embiid's rookie season? because he didn't sign JJ until next year. you mean the gerald henderson and jerryd bayless signings? real stroke of genius LMFAO.  seems like you may have no idea what you're talking about."
"that president fucked it all up.    nixed a trade of Okafor for the future Jaylen Brown pick.  Then placed his son in charge who immediately traded Jerami Grant for Ersan among other wasted assets.  Then, after burnergate brought in Philly Vlade who then turned in so many assets into Max Tobi and Seth Curry"
"Barnes is fair enough but White only made it because he plays for Pop, Plumlee initially made it under Coach K because he's a duke guy. Both got their spots on blatant favoritism.    I don't actually agree with Rose about his tokenism take, but the issue is that there are players being selected who seem to clearly owe it to their personal connections to the program instead of their basketball abilities. Jerami Grant is a good player but he got in this year because he got lobbyed for by KD and Dame, for example."
Congrats on that gold medal Jerami Grant and Keldon Johnson.
When this game is over I want a supercut of all the Jerami Grant + Keldon Johnson handshakes after being denied high fives
jerami grant really got relegated
Jerami Grant got terrible body language on the bench lol
Lol y'all see Booker miss Keldon Johnson with the high five twice and Jerami Grant giving him two handshakes
You take Jerami Grant over Gobert our Fournier?
I'd rather give Jerami Grant or Javale some minutes than Dame. Dude is really not himself out there.
"Would it cost that much? Jerami Grant and Danilo Gallinari were signed and traded last year and their old teams didn‚Äôt have to add much, think draft and stash rights or 750K in cash."
He wants a Jerami Grant opportunity where he gets the opportunity to be the guy while making $20+/year
"Imo, the bottom of the east got stronger as a whole. We probably will take time to gel, so the beginning of the season I think we won't be good enough to keep a .500 record. The weakest team that made it last year was the Wiz, but they still have Beal, plus maybe a more balanced lineup with Kuz and Dinwiddie. Bulls got way better, Indy has Warren back, Hornets added Oubre and Bouknight with another year under LaMelos belt.   Pistons have an average age of 23.5, and all but Jerami Grant will have a max of 1 year of experience in the starting lineup. I expect us to win 32-37 games and end up fighting for the 10th place play in but ultimately not make it."
because Jerami Grant falls in love with Japan and decides to retire from the nba so he can fully embrace his new weeb lifestyle in Tokyo.
**G:** Dejounte Murray  **G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **F:** Kyle Anderson  **F:** Jerami Grant  **C:** Jarrett Allen   **Bench:** Jalen Brunson / Alex Burks Kevin Huerter /  Christian Wood / Mitchell Robinson
Shai Gilgeous Alexander / Jamal Murray / Jerami Grant / Michael Porter Jr / Clint Capela
Lonzo Ball - Jamal Murray - Jerami Grant - John Collins - Clint Capela.
"Forget Josh Smith, the Pistons are paying Blake Griffin over $29 million this season. He's getting almost as much from Detroit this year as Kelly Olynyk and Jerami Grant combined."
"Yes but it's going to be extremely hard to outvalue 7 solid players for $20 million.   For reference here's some guys who are making about $20 million:  Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jerami Grant, Julius Randle, FVV, Zach Lavine, Goran Dragic, Clint Capela, Bojan Bogdonovic, Domatas Sabonis, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe"
"Nope Detroit has 7   Cade Cunningham, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Jerami Grant, Sekou Doumbouya, Saben Lee, and Isaiah Stewart."
"I mean we did sit guys like Mason Plumlee and Wayne Ellington and Jerami Grant a lot towards the last 10-15 games of the season. But yeah we still tried to win a lot for most of the year, we just sucked at it"
"I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs overpaid (and if he is, it‚Äôs not by much, so the difference is pretty insignificant), but it could be argued he was more efficient shooting in his last year with the Lakers and during his stint with the Pelicans (based on EFG% and TS%) than he was in 19-20, and possibly even last year. His points are up from when he was in New Orleans, but that‚Äôs mostly due to taking more shots (2.7 more PPG on 3.7 more shots). He was a much improved passer and 3PT shooter this year, but if he had built on his NOP numbers in his first year in NY instead of taking a dip, I think Jerami Grant probably would‚Äôve been the MIP this year.   That being said, Randle deserves his contract. He‚Äôs the main guy on that Knicks team and was underpaid on his previous contract, and they couldn‚Äôt afford to risk losing him after this season. A 20-10 big man with passing ability is worth near-max money 9 times out of 10, and worse players have been paid as much or more. The ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù and ‚Äúoverpaid‚Äù comments are coming mostly from people who suffer from recency bias and only watched him during the playoffs."
Jerami Grant literally played for Syracuse
Is Jerami Grant really so useless that he should get no minutes? I know he's not KD but does he really deserve to be relegated to the JaVale Mcgee role?
I just want to see jerami grant :(
i forgot keldon johnson and jerami grant we‚Äôre on this team honestly
Jerami Grant should be getting waaaay more run. He‚Äôs a great two way and is one of the only players on the roster that played as a role player recently.
"Yeah if it‚Äôs Paul George than hell yeah, but he‚Äôs not on any trade block.  If it‚Äôs Beal or Dame then probably but not so sure about the fit but def worth a shot.  If it‚Äôs Ben Simmons or Siakam or Jerami Grant then probably not worth it if you have to ship out Wiggins to match contract, on top of all the good prospects in Kuminga, Moody, Wiseman, Poole"
"I mean look at this roster, I don't think you'd really want any of them if you're rebuilding. Diallo was super young and athletic but was missing skills (like all of them). The rest of the young guys are either out of the league or averaging &lt;5 minutes. Jerami Grant was the only one that they really missed out on, and even then he's probably a little older than their ideal window.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/OKC/2019.html"
"PG: Darius Garland/ KPJ SG: SGA SF: Cade Cunningham  PF: Jerami Grant C: Jonathan Isaac or Jarrett Allen  Being hopeful here that Cade is as advertised and what Isaac showed before getting hurt is real. I think this lineup is good enough for at least a second round appearance assuming they don‚Äôt run into 76ers, Bucks, or Nets.   Coaching is the real difference maker here"
"I've only watched the last game vs Spain, but it appears that JaVale doesn't play, and Jerami Grant has the Thanasis role (come in for less than a minute for defense). Do I have that correct?"
"PG: Cade; SG: Jalen Green; SF: Jerami Grant, PF: Christian Wood; C: Evan Mobley.  I‚Äôd rather get Mobley than SGA.  The drop off from SGA to Jalen Green in terms of offensive production isn‚Äôt going to be much, but the increase from Carter to Mobley is probably huge."
Mine would be this with SF and PF being pretty interchangeable. This is just off the top of my head without looking at rosters.  PG: SGA SG: Eric Gordon SF: Johnathan Isaac PF: Jerami Grant C: Christian Wood
"can go smaller and use Prince George County, Maryland; population 900k  KD, Oladipo, Markelle Fultz, Michael Beasley, Ty Lawson, Jeff Green, Quinn Cook, Jerami Grant, Roy Hibbert, Thomas Robinson, Jarrett Jack.  They could probably give Slovenia a run"
"He would have also had that home grown talent if Colangelo didn‚Äôt trade them all. Look at TJ, Jerami Grant, Holmes, Covington. All great role players who would have really added to the Sixers bench and at the time we still had the assets to try to make a big trade for a 3rd star"
"man that‚Äôs crazy, imagine 2 years ago offering CJ straight up for Jerami Grant, i agree Detroit is probably way better off with Jerami."
"Would honestly really like a Jerami Grant trade for the extra cap space, better fit, and improved defense.. but no way the Pistons would trade away one of the first guys to choose to sign with them in a while. Can‚Äôt think of many other realistic options but it would be nice to have some sort of bench depth."
"Here's my take.   1. Portland should be in the Ben Simmons sweepstakes. 2. Portland should be in the Pascal Siakam sweepstakes.  3. Would Detroit trade Jerami Grant for Nurkic? He doesn't fit Cade's timeline so is he going to be on the team when it's time for Detroit to win?  Portland's issue is defense, they never have enough of it and offense, they get so little of it from their wings and bigs. All three of these guys theoretically would help."
"The Pistons currently have 6 ACC players: Wayne Ellington, Jerami Grant, Frank Jackson, Jahlil Okafor, Mason Plumlee, and Dennis Smith"
We'll take him and make Jerami Grant 2.0
I'm glad Jerami Grant got to play 37 seconds
I bet they could make the money work for Jerami Grant without giving up any starters. It would cost a couple good prospects and a pick but he would fit really well in that offense.
"keeping simmons is the best option so hopefully no bridges have been burned fully.  The regular season still has value you just have to not have the worst choke in franchise history in the playoffs, they were set up to have a legitimate chance to win this year and Simmons was still a big part of that.  Adding was always a better option, having someone to run the offense when Ben turns into a lemon is something we've needed for years.  We had jimmy butler for like 2 months and then decided tobias was a better option...  We really got screwed by the league office when they installed the Colangelos.  Even with everything that has gone wrong you could argue they had chances to win in 2019 and 2021.  From Hinkie getting ousted, Fultz forgetting how to shoot, Colangelo doing nothing for 4 years, Brand lighting everything on fire for 2, to Simmons in the playoffs to Okafor, Colangelo, Brand, Tobias, Butler walking for no return.   I mean you can see all the Hinkie guys getting paid this offseason and even some last offseason.  TJ, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Covington, Saric.  It is insanity that he may have left us with a better roster in 2015 than we have now (that being Roco/Grant/Saric/Embiid and the first pick being either Simmons or Ingram since he wasnt there to draft).  Then you have so many valuable picks, Nerlens and Jah when they still had value in trades, and room for two maxes.  The way the Sixers fucked this up is absolutely legendary."
Play Jerami Grant please.
When the US gonna unleash the GOAT Jerami Grant?
Play jerami grant
"Nope.  Russ, Oladipo, Adams, Sabonis, Jerami Grant, Kanter, and Cam Payne was a bit of a makeshift roster, but clearly the most talented roster he‚Äôs ever been on and it‚Äôs not even close"
"No, he brought in shitty players. No one would want or pay for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Nerlens Noel, or Christian Wood on their rosters to support their stars."
Bad Boys 3.0 starring:  Cade Cunningham as Isiah Thomas  Kelly Olynk as Bill Laimbeer  Jerami Grant as Rick Mahorn
"Pistons fans, I know you‚Äôre excited for your future, but just imagine if you traded all of it away for Ben Simmons! Cade, Saddiq, and Jerami Grant (plus picks of course) should get it done."
"I'm somewhere in the middle of the trade cj debate, i think he offers a lot of value as a scorer who can take over playoff games, but he is a horrendously bad defensive fit next to dame, and he can be a ball stopper at times. with the addition of powell, cj's spot on this team is really unclear. we also have ant simons off the bench, who is better from 3 and gives more effort defensively. personally, i think a new coach will hopefully transform both our offense (pnr/iso heavy to more ball movement/cutting) and our defense (non-existant to something) and both changes could help cj, but they might not. he was having his best year before he got injured last season, maybe he can replicate the magic. generally not a ton of trade options either, though our sub has floated guys like Hayward or Jerami Grant  Who tf wants trade brook lopez lmao"
So jerami grant at pick 39 was a miss?
"Maybe because 2022 Pistons are a legitimate dark horse? If the Pistons give Demar the most money and can sell him on the 2022 season, why wouldn't he go there? and from the Pistons perspective, roster moves could get wild once Griffin's off the books. Front-load a Demar contract right now during a throwaway year, develop Cade and Bey, see what you can do in 2022. Free Agency is looking a bit dry for the Pistons, unless Durant decides to get just buckwild to shake off the Hardest Road heat, but cap space and assets could make Detroit premier trade partners.   I think the Pistons would need to get a better piece down-low, unless Garza's actually capable of metamorphosis. Jerami Grant is obviously great, but I'm not sold on anyone else."
Jerami Grant
"Is Jerami Grant at pick 39 also a bust, just because Jokic was 2 picks after him? Obviously not, Grant is great and has been so much more than you could ever hope for the 39th pick.   Who was available later shouldn‚Äôt be the only determining factor of who‚Äôs a bust."
jerami grant?
"Nah man I just don't see the fit. They're gonna wanna give Cade and Hayes as much minutes as they can to help push along their development. And I'm pretty sure they view Cade as their point guard of the future. Plus they have Bey, Jerami Grant, and I think Isaiah Stewart. There's no reason for Detroit to sign Dinwiddie or for Dinwiddie to go there."
"Christian wood, embiid, richaun holmes and jerami grant were all good draft picks, and he signed undrafted players like covington and tj mcconell"
"I mean, if you're gonna name them you should also name all the 2nd round picks and undrafted FA's we signed and developed. Namely: Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, etc."
THJ at about 20 million a year would be a fine contract and it's not like Detroit needs to be frugal. Cade will be on his rookie scale deal for 4 years and Jerami Grant is still two years away from his next deal.
Oh this will be like the Jerami Grant situation potentially last yr. Theyll have to pay alot and hope that what at the time looks like an overpay doesnt end up being one. Bet it would take like 4 yrs $85-90 mil.
"Since Warriors are over the luxary cap then they can only take on 125% of outgoing salary + $100k.  So you just find out how much Jerami Grant makes next year: $20,002,500.  Then you find out how much Wiseman and Kuminga make next year:  $9,166,800 + $4,555,300 = $13,722,000.  Then you take the higher salary, subtract $100k and divide by 1.25: ($20,002,500 - $100,000)/1.25 = $15,922,000. Which is $2.2M more than Wiseman and Kuminga's combined salaries.  So, yeah. Gotta send filler. Or Moses Moody at $2,968,400."
"You could probably make it work with Jerami Grant without crazy cap maneuvering. Wiseman, Kuminga, and random fillers like Paschall should generally work straight up for Jerami Grant."
"OK, Jerami Grant sounds about right.  If the Warriors were to do this type of deal, it would be after all the other bigger names have fallen through. I have no idea how that salary would work without moving Wiggins."
Just Wiseman/Kuminga? Maybe Jerami Grant?
"i agree, trading for Siakam is pointless. if they got Jerami Grant though and kept 1 of Wiseman/Kuminga, I like their title chances"
Jerami Grant sighting
"Star? No, but I‚Äôve always though they should slightly overpay for Jerami Grant"
"He did the Fultz trade, waited way too long to deal Nerlens and Okafor, traded a first and second for An≈æejs Paseƒç≈Üiks, gave Jerryd Bayless a 3 year deal, and traded Jerami Grant for Ersan Ilyasova.  He was probably going to be hated no matter what though since he replaced Hinkie and got the job from his dad."
"Jerami Grant is a stud averaging 22/4/2 with very good defense.  Schroder won sixth man of the year just last year.  Keep pretending that he was playing with bums who had no chance. PG+Russ were two top 15 players. That roster was better than the Cavs post-Kyrie. Again, keep making excuses for Russ. CP3 comes to OKC and that team doesn't lose a beat. It's like some of you are blind to what happened or probably began watching basketball just recently."
"I‚Äôd trade Jerami Grant for Moody no cap, literally Cade‚Äôs long term partner"
imagine thinking that Pascal Siakam is worth a young player with all star potential. Siakam last season was a poor mans Jerami Grant. Worse on both the offensive and defensive ends of the floor.
"PG, Steven Adams, Russ, Schroder, and Jerami Grant. I'll take that team."
We will do Jerami Grant for 2 of them young boys.
Isnt it a great feeling? We have a young group as well  PG: Cade Cunningham - 19  SG: Killian Hayes - 20  SF: Saddiq Bey - 22  PF: Jerami Grant - 27 (our old man in the lineup)  C: Isaiah Steward - 20  With some young dudes off the bench as well in Josh Jackson and Diallo
Does Jerami Grant or Christian Wood work?
Jerami Grant
"That‚Äôs debatable, we gave away so many picks for rental rights to Jimmy, moving up for fultz, even the ‚Äúwins‚Äù beside Joel are like Tobias go quiet in the 4th Harris.  We shipped off current rising stars like Christian wood, jerami grant, bridges, saric, etc before they got a chance.   It‚Äôs just bad move after bad move besides joel"
"&gt;  &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄùBecoming a Piston was about challenging Jerami Grant the basketball player. But uprooting to Detroit was about satisfying the other Jerami Grant, the part of him that‚Äôll resonate far longer than his NBA career.""  And there's a plethora of other quotes from him about coming here for the city, too. Almost like a decision can be made for a multitude of reasons, even the appeal of our horrendous city.   https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/"
Literally one year ago Jerami Grant chose to come to Detroit even though the Nuggets offered him the same contract.
"Making sure we can sign Diallo, Frank Jackson, and then use the trade exemption. Or maybe we'll ""Over pay"" another player like we did Jerami Grant last year? Lots of options but we'll find out next week."
"With one pick to come, here's how Detroit's young roster now looks:  **PG:** Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee.   **SG:** Hami Diallo, Josh Jackson.  **SF:** Saddiq Bey.  **PF:** (Jerami Grant), Sekou Doumbouya.  **C:** Isaiah Stewart."
PG-Killian Hayes SG- Cade Cunningham SF- Saddiq Bey PF- Jerami Grant C- Isaiah Stewart  the future is bright in Detroit they just need a better coach
"Not just KCP, but Jerami Grant, Dinwiddie and DeRozan are great pieces to have around Beal."
"I think it actually helped those guys on an individual level. They gave a lot of players actual minutes to grow and develop against top talent, rather than sit on the back of the bench and only play 3-on-3 at the end of practice. And look at Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, even Nerlens Noel now as well. They're all doing awesome around the league"
"Tbh Ben simmons + 2-3 picks for Cade+Jerami grant works from the 76ers perspective but I doubt pistons will give up Cade for a 6' 10"" guy afraid to dunk on Trae young"
Jerami grant
Jerami Grant the GOAT +30 in 12:44
"Serge Ibaka for arrean Ilysova, Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis  At the time Serge was 26, a 3 time all-defensive player and making $12 million per year. Magic we‚Äôre looking to improve and compete, the move was seen as OKC being desperate to keep KD.  Serge‚Äôs career goes sideways in Orlando, OKC turns Dipo and Sabonis into PG for a few years and then Shai and more, Ersan into Jerami Grant"
"lmfao jerami grant was in most improved award talks this year for a reason and its not because he was a positive on that thunder team  &gt; Was it a great roster? No, but it was about as much talent as the Thunder ever put around KD &amp; Westbrook after Harden left  ""imagine taking russ off that team, see how bad they were. Kd can't win a championship with those cats"" - KD"
"They had Jerami Grant, Steven Adams (back when he could move), plus Shroder &amp; Noel providing good punch off the bench in 2019.   Was it a great roster? No, but it was about as much talent as the Thunder ever put around KD &amp; Westbrook after Harden left. And they won 1 playoff game that year.   &gt;PG shrunk in those playoff runs &amp; Russ obviously had bad games too  Russ shot 36% from the field in a 5 games against a Lillard/McCollum backcourt."
"So, this is part of the reason we're so pumped about Jeremi Grant. He outright said he's here to help build Detroit, grow the community, and have a strong voice in the Black community. James Edwards III had an amazing article if you have an Athletic subscription https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/"
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
"* Prestige of being a #1 pick.  * Solid young talent with no pressure to win immediately.  * #1 pick will make $4.5M more than the #2 pick over the course of the rookie contract.  I'd rather grow next to Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Sekou Doumbouya, Jerami Grant (and lots of cap flexibility) than wait out the John Wall/Eric Gordon cap-space-blackhole backcourt in Houston."
"lol, I don't mean literally DFS, but just that type of player. Jerami Grant was a great choice and I think they should fill the roster with those types of players who know how to complement stars. Even the most talented foreign teams at the Olympics might have 2 NBA starter-level players at most. There's no reason we need to send an all-star team that doesn't know how to play with each other."
He's right. That roster has no talent. Jerami Grant shouldn't be your best player.
"OG Anunoby was compared to Jerami Grant, which was a fair comparable up until this past season with Grant popping off offensively  DSJ's comparison to Bledsoe was accurate, for all the wrong reasons lol.  Dearon Fox was compared to John Wall  Ben Simmons was compared to Draymond Green  Montrez Harrell was compared to Taj Gibson  Kelly Oubre was called a poor man's Paul George lol  Lavine was called a poor man's Westbrook, though they have similar playstyles, Lavine is a much better 3P shooter"
"A fully loaded Team USA would dominate Europe and I don‚Äôt think it is even close. Team USA is missing a good amount of their best players. There is a narrative that Europe is closing in on USA talent wise but I don‚Äôt believe this to be true. Team USA lost to Nigeria for god‚Äôs sakes.  With Team USA there is a chemistry issue. Their coach is a very defensive scheme heavy coach, while their roster is filled with one way scorers. These players also don‚Äôt play together very often. Jerami Grant, Kelvin Johnson, Javale Mcgee are on team USA. There are 3 two-way players on team USA rn, while the rest of the roster are one-way scorers or one-way defenders.  Team USA is missing a good amount of their best players. While every other nation has all their best players. It would be like Brazil‚Äôs football team playing without Neymar and their other best players.  Team USA will probably lose this year and not get gold. They will then be disappointed and will return the next olympics with all their best players. This has happened before. Lebron, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, AD, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Chris Paul all added and replacing players on this roster would result in vastly different results.   It is good and interesting that the world is becoming better at basketball collectively, however just because a team loses a basketball tournament doesn‚Äôt mean they weren‚Äôt the most talented. Teams falter because of chemistry issues in every sport all the time."
"Jerami Grant needs minutes, good defender and can make shots, not biased at all here tho no siree"
LETS GO JERAMI GRANT
the original Dream Team had 11/12 players as HoFers. And I just watched Jerami Grant shoot FTs
Houston Jerami Grant to drop 30
Jerami Grant slander is not appreciated
"Would have to be a three way trade that gets them a high quality guard or wing. I was thinking a trade where the Wolves get Simmons, the Sixers end up with Malik Beasley and Jerami Grant (and PatBev?), and the Pistons end up with assets from both teams (McDaniels, Maxey/Thybulle, picks, swaps, etc). Wolves could get Simmons without giving up DLo, Ant, or KAT, which they really want, and the Pistons are tanking, so the right package would entice them imo. And the Sixers are realy good with Curry/Green/Grant/Harris/Embiid and Beasley as a sixth man."
"Jerami Grant is impressive as someone who made it all the way through that 4 year ""Hinkie Special"" contract he signed as a rookie and has worked and worked to make it to where he is now."
"Except Grant specifically signed with Detroit for a larger role, playing for an African-American coach in a primarily African-American city.  There was an article on the athletic about it.  He turned down the same money offer from the Nuggets for those reasons.   https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/  Trading him to the Warriors doesn‚Äôt exactly send the right message to prospective free agents."
"Maybe Im biased but I feel like 2 of Moody, Kuminga and Wiseman plus whosoevers needed to match salary for Jerami Grant works phenomenally for both teams"
"How so? Other than Jah his picks were pretty good and no one bats 1.000  A bunch of 2nd rounders some of whom worked out some didn't. That's normal. Jerami Grant was one of these for example.  MCW and Dario Saric at 11 and 12 respectively are what people point to, but are they really evidence of Hinkie drafting poorly? Lots of guys drafted around there don't work out and MCW was ROY. Hinkie traded him when his value was high, was really good maneuvering all in all.  Saric gets a bad rap but he was still playing meaningful minutes on a finals team last season and has been a contributor scoring double digits most of his career. People just don't like awkward looking euros who aren't transcendent talents."
"Also brought in Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Richaun Holmes, and TJ McConnell  The only pick that is straight bad is Jah and word at the time was Hinkie wanted KP and got over ruled by ownership"
"Raptors: Ben Simmons  Detroit: Scottie Barnes   Sizers: Fred Van Vleet, Jerami Grant  Historically a 4th pick tends to land a borderline all-star average starter and Jerami Grant is that according to 538. Sixers get Depth, and Raptors get a young socialite that matches the age of their core"
"What do opinions of the trade matter to what Hinkie theoretically would‚Äôve done?  His M.O. the whole time in Philadelphia was increasing optionality in order to land a star player. Giving up a 1st round pick to move up two spots in the lottery is not a Hinkie move.  Also you say he didn‚Äôt draft well outside of embiid; TJ McConnell, Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Richaun Holmes, etc. would have to disagree with you"
"Timberwolves flip their backup PG/ SG duo for the perfect PF fit next to KAT and D'Lo  Blazers fix their backcourt issue and introduce size. Instead of a starting line-up of Dame/ CJ/ Powell they now run Dame/ Powell/ Jerami Grant and they also get a sixth man combo guard off the bench in Malik Beasley.  Sixers snag CJ who is a much better fit next to Embiid, they also snag a backup PF in Jaden McDaniels who should improve on his respectable rookie numbers, and they also get a future 1st from Minnesota that they can flip for a vet at the trade deadline to shore up any gaps they have.  Pistons get two first round picks for Jerami Grant who doesn't really fit their timeline."
"4 Team Trade  Minnesota Out: Malik Beasley, Beverley, McDaniels, three 1st round picks  Minnesota In: Ben Simmons   Sixers Out: Ben Simmons  Sixers In: CJ McCollum, McDaniels, 1x Timberwolves 1st round pick  Blazers Out: CJ McCollum  Blazers In: Malik Beasley, Jerami Grant  Detroit Pistons Out: Jerami Grant  Detroit Pistons In: Patrick Beverley, 2x Timberwolves first round picks"
"Okay, then take away wood and you still have Jerami Grant and Holmes who were 2nd round picks he drafted, and McConnell and RoCo who were UDFAs. What other GM can you show that has had a similar level of success in a 4 year window"
"I think that's a really good young core. I'm not a big DLo guy, but with that lineup he starts to make a lot more sense.  That said, they are the Timberwolves. Those picks could start to get really valuable in a couple years, and things always seem to go sideways in Minnesota.   I can't see Philly keeping all those picks, but getting a third team involved could really help them get a really good player, or go after a couple good players. I can't think of guys who may be available for just picks though - Siakam? Sexton? Jerami Grant?  Buddy? Isaac?  Most teams are either trying to compete this year, or don't have anyone realistic they'd flip for future picks. OKC has a million picks already, and the Rockets/Pistons/Magic/Cavs/Spurs don't have much that would really keep the Sixers a contender.  A Simmons trade is so confusing to me. I think he's really good, but I think it's nuts to give up too much for him because you really need the flexibility to get the right guys around him, and experiment with different lineups. He's not a one-man offence like Harden/Russ/Lebron, or a guy who can fit on any team like Kawhi/PG/Beal/Klay."
"&gt;He picked up fringe guys who have since bloomed like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Richaun Holmes, and also role players like TJ McConnell and Robert Covington.   How is having these guys on your team for a hot minute and trading them/waiving them before they actually develop supposed to be a point in his favor? I do give him credit for the Covington acquisition/contract (see some of my previous posts) and sure McConnell is a fine player for his pedigree, but the fact the Sixers had every opportunity to cycle through 2nd rounders/UDFAs and give them playing time and only got two players out of it who actually stuck around for the team becoming competitive is exactly why I don't think he's some genius GM like his defenders purport. It'd be a bigger issue if NONE of these guys stuck but the absence of complete failure doesn't automatically make Hinkie good.  I don't see anyone giving the Hornets credit just for taking a flier on Wood because their GM doesn't have a cult of personality around them."
"&gt; after your fan base gave up on him anyway.  care to go back and find the thread where we traded jerami grant? because very few people were in favor of that move. you do realize that Hinkie didn't trade Jerami, correct?  Richaun Holmes isn't very good? So he's better or worse than Dwight?  Robert Covington isn't a good player?  You do realize that keeping Jrue means that we likely never get a chance to draft Embiid, correct? Like we didn't have Embiid on the roster before we traded Jrue. You do know that right?"
"&gt; It‚Äôs only now after they failed you‚Äôre calling them bad.  many people in our sub were calling out the tobias trade when it happened. most of us were fooled with the horford signing.  &gt;Same thing once Doc got fired from the clippers y‚Äôall were thirsty as fuck  this is a blanket statement. many many many fans were against the rivers signing. including myself.  Hinkie never got a chance to finish what he started. So it's mostly an unknown. He made some poor decisions but the franchise was still set up to have significantly more success than any era since Dr. J.  Which picks of his were ""horrid""? Okafor. You got another? Here's some players Hinkie acquired outside of the top 10.  Jerami Grant  TJ McConnell  Richaun Holmes  Robert Covington  Dario Saric (drafted elfrid payton and flipped him to the magic for a FRP. The magic moved essentially two spots in a draft from 14 to 12 for a FRP)  Hinkie also refused to bog the franchise down with long-term bullshit contracts which gave the team massive flexibility.   This is not even to mention that we had players like Alex Caruso and Christian Wood in the summer league and on the NBA roster during this time period. Not going to give Hinkie credit for that as they did not stay with the team very long.  Hinkie was the GM for 1.5 years until Jerry was hired. he was essentially forced out of power after Jerry joined.  I challenge you to name another GM who acquired that type of talent outside the top 10 in the draft in the course of two off-seasons."
Don‚Äôt forget that was our pick prior because we traded Jerami Grant for it
"&gt;moves on the margins for anyone  He picked up fringe guys who have since bloomed like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Richaun Holmes, and also role players like TJ McConnell and Robert Covington. That's pretty encouraging foresight. He saw that MCW wasn't going to last and shipped out the ROY-winner.  He whiffed on Okafor and Nerlens, but even those are tough because the only legit players who went close behind them were McCollum and Kristaps, who refused to work out with us.  I agree that he had bad relationships with agents, but he seemed to have a solid eye for talent"
"Who would even be the third team? You'd need a rebuilding team with a win-now player they're willing to trade. Maybe Detroit with Jerami Grant, but who else fits the bill?"
Jerami Grant ?
No way Detroit is moving Jerami Grant rn
"I don't think there's that many teams willing to part with their stars for picks at the moment. Maybe Detroit with Jerami Grant? Maybe the Spurs too but wouldn't want to bet on it. This will obviously change towards thr trade deadline, but Simmons will be long gone by then."
Sixers get:   * Jerami Grant  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Pistons get:   * McDaniels  * Prince  * Maxey  * 2 Wolves 1sts  * 2 Sixers 1sts
"Who says no?   Sixers get:   * Jerami Grant  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Pistons get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Naz Reid  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * 2023, 2025 Sixers 1sts  * 2023, 2025 Wolves 1sts   * 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028 Sixers pick swap options  Sixers get a championship roster top to bottom. Beverley/Green/Grant/Harris/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man is FILTHY.   Wolves get Ben without giving up D'Lo, Ant, or KAT. D'Lo/Curry/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a good ass team  Pistons flip their star to launch their rebuild forward. They get four great prospects, four 1sts, and four pick swaps (two of which will probably be really valuable down the line once Embiid and Harris are old)."
"I could see Detroit moving Jerami Grant for a combo of Wolves and Sixers 1sts and young players. You can't tell me they wouldn't take 3 Wolves 1sts, 3 Sixers 1sts, Thybulle, Maxey, McDaniels, Reid... for Grant (obviously that's an overpay, but it's to illustrate the point that it could be done with some combo of the assets the Sixers would have to work with)"
"Pistons? Sixers would love Jerami Grant, and between the Timberwolves assets and their own picks, they could probably make it work.  If they get Beasley/McDaniels/Reid/3 1sts/3 swaps from the Wolves for Simmons, they can turn around offer the Pistons some combination of McDaniels, Reid, 3 Wolves 1sts, 3 Wolves pick swaps, Maxey, Thybulle, Reed, Springer, and their own 1sts and swaps.   I think the Sixers would be very happy to swap out Simmons for Beasley and Grant, and I figure the rebuilding Pistons would move him for an overwhelming number of 1sts and multiple prospects"
Maybe the Pacers could throw in another player since they have so many solid guys. Not sure who though.  Also what about Jerami Grant? I feel like he would help the Sixers a ton and then they could play Tobias at the 3. I know absolutely nothing about the Pistons so that might be a dumb question.
"**Beasley** (microwave guard, an established 20ppg, 40% 3pt), **McDaniels** (great defensive wing/forward prospect that can contribute now), **Beverley** (proven NBA veteran guard), **Reid** (fan favorite, talented but undersized backup center with a good offensive package who can space the floor), as well as **several 1st rounders** and **several pick swaps**  In this trade, I could see the picks and maybe McDaniels, plus 1-2 young guys from the Sixers, going to a third team for another contribute-now player. Maybe McDaniels/Maxey/3 1sts for Jerami Grant?"
"I mean, is he though.  The list of players I'd rather have than Wiggins is pretty big.  Lebron, KD, Kawhi, PG, Butler, Tatum, Derozan, Middleton, Hayward, Ingram, MPJ, Jerami Grant, Mikal Bridges, Powell, OG.  And then it's arguable for Bogdanovic, Barnes, Slo-mo, THJ, Harris, Hunter, Miles Bridges, Morris, Ant, Bey.  I know some of these guys can slide to SG/PF depending on teammates, but that's a lot of guys that can be a SF on a team where it'd be at the very best, Wiggins competing for the starting job.  That's not a good outlook to be paid 30m when 25 guys are at least competing with him or outright better."
"Almost every player in that range has had an All Star appearance or looks like a future All Star (i.e. Murray, Fox).  Wiggins is more suited in that 16M-20M range imo, with guys like Jerami Grant, Caris Levert, OG Anunoby, etc."
"Jerami Grant largely signed with Detroit because of GM Troy Weaver, who turned around the franchise's future direction in one offseason.  If Minnesota starts winning (they are close) you'll see players signing to team up with KAT, Edwards, Russell, Beasley."
"I know I'm late to the party but I didn't see anyone say Jerami Grant. Watched dude almost beat us in overtime last year, Dude was consistent and if another team had a good game plan to contain him he was good with decision making finding other teammates. He also probably got some game from being with the Olympic dudes so idk about superstardom but this guy could be someone to watch"

Big respect to Grant for going to Detroit because they have a Black GM and coach, but I‚Äôm guessing he would also be willing to go to the 6ers if management approached him openly about it (might be a different case if they were to blindside him with a trade)."

"Jerami Grant is a great shooter though, at least by the standards of our 2018/19 team"
"&gt;  but out of his class, there are 3-5 players better than him  Embiid, Smart, Randle, Lavine, Capela, Jerami Grant, Nikola Jokic, Jordan Clarkson, Jusuf Nurkic (when healthy), TJ Warren (when healthy) are all guys who I think are better than Wiggins is right now. Dude probably isn't top 10 from his own class."
"Jerami Grant doesnt have a spotty jumper though, his percentage was about average but he's been at about 37% I believe for the past few seasons. Plus he has a good mid range game"
Jerami grant in there somewhere
"Im still not sure with him back, their defense gives me pause. I feel like people still think jerami grant is there picking up the slack, the reality is that they are pretty positionally weak at defense and their schemes arent outrageously good to make up for it. Im a suns fan so take it for a grain of salt but I feel like Suns still win even with healthy Murray as a matter of their lackluster defense in six or sevzn as opposed to a sweep of course, maybe thats crazy but thats just how I feel watching them."
"Cade, Cunningham, Cade Cunningham, Jerami Grant and Sadiq Bey  Seriously though Killian and Isaiah Stewart"
"&gt; Lol y‚Äôall literally forget how bad that thunder squad really was. All of them are bums now except brook.  Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Jerami Grant, Steven Adams...  Wtf are you talking about?  Sabonis was literally an All-Star *this year* my guy."
"&gt; Your tanking was more blatant with Presti‚Äôs trades to stockpile picks, bench perfectly playable players like Horford, etc  ‚Ä¶ The Pistons did the exact same thing with Blake Griffin and got no hate from it from this sub just n FYI. They also benched Jerami Grant towards end the season and the Raptors benched a lot of their players to end the season as well. Weirdly, the Thunder got a lot of backlash from people for benching Horford when other teams did the same shit and no one cared.   &gt;And Kuminga was supposed to be a long term prospect but even then he already looks better than Giddey, so if you wanna develop quicker to make SGA happy you might have made some wrong choices.  Well I hope he looks better than a guy who only played 5 minutes in the SUMMER LEAGUE. Also, Kuminga flashed some nice potential in summer league but let‚Äôs not act like the dudes shooting splits weren‚Äôt 39/27/65.   &gt;Obviously nothing‚Äôs guaranteed, but you guys mortgaged everything for these picks, you couldn‚Äôt even trade up to get the best prospects in a stacked draft class you should be investing heavily in and you couldn‚Äôt even take Kuminga.  Well it takes two teams to make a trade dude lmaooo. Which team in the top 5 could the Thunder realistically make a trade with without giving up SGA? Also, Kuminga dropped out of the ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù top 5 for a reason. Like I said already, none of these rookies have played in the league so saying the Thunder should‚Äôve picked Kuminga is weird when Giddey has a chance to be a better player than him."

"Unfortunately, they were eliminated before. :/   The team was George Hill, Tony Allen, VC, Jerami Grant &amp; A Sabonis. I thought they were decent but guess not."
&gt;but he was the only American player who could be considered an all-time great NBA player  how dare you besmirch Jerami Grant
"Philly ousted Sam Hinkie because they didn't trust the process. They replaced him with Bryan Coangelo who was a nepotistic hire by Jerry Colangelo. When Hinkie left, the Sixers had the following assets on their books:  ASSETS:  * Joel Embiid  * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons)   * Jerami Grant   * Christian Wood   * Richaun Holmes   * Robert Covington   * Dario Saric   * Nerlens Noel   * Jahlil Okafor   * 2016 Miami 1st round pick   * 2016 OKC 1st round pick   * Kings future 1st round pick   * Pick swap with the Kings   * Tons of 2nd round picks   ____  While hindsight is 20:20, it is undeniable that most of these assets were ultimately wasted. Brett Brown and the Colangelos completely wasted Philadelphia's window of contention by creating a culture which caused Jimmy Butler to want out. Shortly after picking Brown over Butler, they fired Brown and replaced him with Doc Rivers. After yet another 3-1 loss, Rivers threw Simmons under the bus in an interview which ignited the situation you are dealing with now.  There is no argument here, I just wrote that to be diplomatic. The Sixers FO has been terrible."
I think an athletic 3 and D forward like Jerami Grant would be substantially better next to Sabonis since he doesn‚Äôt stretch the floor and Draymond doesn‚Äôt either.  But the idea of Sabonis playmaking for Klay wiggins and Steph is very enticing
"+ Holmes, Jerami Grant"
Jrue and Jerami Grant for Simmons and Tobias? That team w/ Embiid could be in the finals
"1) Eligible but not in the league- Isaiah Thomas  2) Short contracts(two-ways, ten-day contracts)- Karim Man√©  3) Non-rotation bench players- Justin Robinson  4) Rotational bench player- Brad Wanamaker   5) Elite bench player(6 MOTY candidates)- Jordan Clarkson  6) Basic starter- Harrison Barnes   7) Niche Starter- Myles Turner   8) Elite starter- Jerami Grant   9) Border line All-Star- CJ McCollum   10) All-Star- Donovan Mitchell   11) All-NBA- Luka Doncic   11) MVP Level- Kevin Durant"
Jerami Grant?
Jerami Grant?
"Playing for a contender right now, I'm looking at:     Guard - CP3 ($4)  Wing - Danny Green ($1)  Wing - OG Anunoby ($2)  Forward - Jerami Grant ($3)  Big - AD ($5)  Defense, switchability, shooters all over the court, and athleticism. Biggest thing this team lacks is playmaking outside of CP3, but AD and Grant all have some ability to move with the ball.  Struggled a lot with AD vs Embiid, and while I think Embiid is the better player, I went with versatility here."
This was my team but with AD instead of Embiid. I also considered Lavine instead of Harden purely because of age and to use the extra dollar somewhere but there weren't many better options $1 up left (maybe Jerami Grant over OG?).
$2 Cade Cunningham 20-25  $4 Donovan Mitchell 25-30  $2 OG Anunoby 24-29  $3 Jerami Grant 27-32  $4 Bam Adebayo 24-29  I went for youth and versatility.  this list was tough.
Yeah people have to look at the assets he left them with:  * Joel Embiid - C * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons) - PF/PG * Jerami Grant  - PF * Christian Wood - PF/C * Richaun Holmes - C * Robert Covington - PF * Dario Saric - PF/C * Nerlens Noel - C * Jahlil Okafor- C  Do people seriously think Hinkie was getting full return on what was the single greatest PF/C logjam in NBA history?  Do people seriously think Hinkie would have saved the 76ers from Colangelo/Brand overinvesting in PFs and Cs?  They had to sell guys at a loss because they had no place for **NINE** +6'10 guys who couldn't shoot.
"**PG:** Ben Simmons   **SG:**  **SF:** Robert Covington  **PF:** Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Dario Saric   **C:** Joel Embiid, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor  For argument's sake, imagine they use the OKC and Miami picks to draft even Caris LeVert and Malik Beasley.   That gives them a starting lineup of Simmons, LeVert, Covington, Grant, Embiid. You only really need to keep one of Wood/Saric and one of Holmes/Noel/Okafor then.   The next part which would have made things *really* interesting is if they take Tatum instead of Fultz in 2017. That gives them a rotation of:   Simmons, LeVert, Tatum, Grant, Embiid with a bench including Beasley, Covington, Wood/Saric and Holmes/Noel.   Then who knows what you could get in a trade with the other one of Wood/Saric, Holmes/Noel/Okafor and all their future picks."
"Especially considering Jerami Grant took a long thing to develop and figure it out.  He was solid with OKC, but he didn't take off until the Nuggets and the Pistons. While he was with Philly, he wouldn't have been much of an asset around the league."
"Awful draft record like finding Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell all in the 2nd round/undrafted‚Ä¶right. Who was an awful pick besides okafor? Noel going 6th in one of the weakest drafts ever is completely reasonable."
"&gt;just look at that insane collection of assets  Adding guys like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel etc is pretty disingenuous since those players realized their full value post hinkie and post sixers.  The criticism I've heard is he did not do anything another person couldn't do...basically saying if the goal is to accumulate assets by being as bad as possible then anyone can do that. Personally I don't think his tenure as GM should be viewed through black and white, good/bad lenses. He did well in some parts (won most of the trades he made) and did poorly in others (failed to build a good team culture, did terribly at the social aspects of the job, mediocre draft record)"
"No the team did not have much talent outside of Embiid. Hinkie could not find any guards and even a lot on OPs list is a bit of a stretch : Okafor and Noel weren‚Äôt that good as pros, the second round picks count for nothing, and Christian Wood had a cup of coffee and jumped around the league for years before figuring it out. Even Jerami Grant was a great find as a 2nd rounder but if he‚Äôs the second best guy you get in 3 years and have 5 lottery picks, that‚Äôs not a good situation to be in."
"Okay, so he acquired Embiid and Simmons, both obvious picks at the position.   Four seasons later Jerami Grant would break out while playing for a functional team who never tanked and emphasized smart team building, so Grant could focus on a role well-suited for him. He was never an ‚Äúasset‚Äù in Philly.   Wood was barely in the league and had a very good year on a tanking team four seasons later.   Richaun Holmes is the FOURTH center on the roster. Very smart to keep drafting the most archaic position in the league and never trading any of them to devalue all of their worth.   Covington and Saric are overrated role players. Covington, particularly, hasn‚Äôt moved the needle for any team who has traded for him. And, in any event, the best trade the Sixers have made in the last decade was Covington and Saric for Jimmy Butler. Even if Butler left, that trade was ballsy and actually imminently put them in position to win the title. Too bad they chose Simmons over Butler. I highly doubt Hinkie makes that trade.   Noel is a slightly better than average journeyman center who Hinkie should have traded for value a year or two earlier. He botched that asset.   Okafor sucks.   Wow, they had a couple mid-to-late firsts and worthless second round picks.   What a war chest."
"Can‚Äôt give him any credit for that when there are other GMs that decided that Fultz wasn‚Äôt worth the number 1 pick, and swindled Colangelo in the process.  And Colangelo didn‚Äôt just draft Fultz, he traded multiple assets to pick a player that became a monumental bust.  I challenge you to find moves made by him thst put the Sixers in a better position to win a championship long term.  On top of the Fultz disaster, he wasted 2 picks on a player that didn‚Äôt even play because he was so bad in Pasecniks, traded helpful players like Jerami Grant for win-now rentals, and failed to bring in any new long term talent that wasn‚Äôt already on the roster.  He was one of the worst GMs even disregarding the burners"
"It 100% depends on the system around you. I‚Äôm just pointing to the countless attempts at super teams that have flopped while the only outliers I can recall are the Heat, Cavs and Warriors. Let‚Äôs point to the Sixers 3 seasons ago against the Raptors. Simmons and Lowry were around the same level at the time, Redick was better than Danny Green, Kawhi was better than Butler, Harris was arguably better than Siakam at the time and Embiid was obviously better than Gasol. The team put together 4 guys who were all star players and put him next to a sniper from range. They still lost though. You could argue they lost by lucky last shot which is fair, but it shouldn‚Äôt have got to that point to begin with based on talent on that roster. You‚Äôre right in saying good coaching does wonders and I agree, but what if you replaced Jimmy with a guy like Khris Middleton, who can shoot from anywhere, doesn‚Äôt always need the ball in his hands, and is great on defence as well. Then have someone like Jerami Grant or Aaron Gordon at the 4 instead of Tobias. I personally think that team would‚Äôve been way better than the one the Sixers had constructed. Despite the three maybe not being as good of players as the players previously on the team, their fit is better and the coaches job becomes easier."
"What do you mean? Dame didn‚Äôt abuse Russ at all in that series. He shot 6/16(37%) when guarded by Russ.   In comparison, he shot 9/16 on Dennis, 12/23 on Jerami Grant, and 10/19 on Paul George."

"Lol how is this upvoted? When the fuck has Jokic had a garbage team? Two years ago  he had Jerami Grant, MPJ, and Malik Beasley coming off the freaking bench. When they got off the Nuggets they showed they could scored 20+ a night.   I dont mean to discredit Jokic but stop exaggerating. Nuggets have been so good at drafting recently that they've been assuredly deep."
"Jerami Grant or Thaddeus Young for the Suns. I think we‚Äôre pretty damn solid at every single position right now except for PF. Jae Crowder is good but we need a guy who can slide in at PF to start or backup and who can move up to C for small ball lineups and Jae‚Äôs not really that, nor is anyone else on our roster"
"Because The Process is massively, massively overrated as an example of team building. The 76ers destroyed everything and intentionally tried to be the worst team in the league year after year after year. The plan was to be bad and get high picks, and build the roster out with low-risk fliers. It‚Äôs not some revolutionary strategy, every team knows that being bad = higher picks = better prospects- it‚Äôs the strategy that Jerry Krause blew up the Bulls in favor of pursuing. What makes team-building is the ability to scout and find players who are under the radar, which the 76ers kind of did with guys like RoCo, but they mostly were bad, got lotto picks, drafted a miss, traded the miss for assets, rinse and repeat. Guys like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Richaun Holmes were guys picked up in The Process who were let go, all players who would have been valuable to Philly. Hinkie and Colangelo‚Äôs talent evaluation was horrible, and they had no consideration for fit."
"He's too good to be just a catch and shoot guy is why. He'd be great if he just did that but he's better than that. That's not what his team needs though, he needs to put up 6 3s a game because there's better players who can do what he can do. It's a tough thing to accept as a player. Most who can't accept playing a role just bounce around places, very few vindicate themselves like Jerami Grant."
"In my view they had the best championship teams, not in terms of talent compared to say the Lakers or Boston, but in regards to their teamwork and defense I think they were top tier and for me that's what basketball is all about. Not only that, the underdog and Bad Boy image were things that always appealed to me. And it's rather easy to fall in love with the '04 Pistons, that's how it started for me. Great fan of Sheed and Big Ben together.   Honestly after that, it was eerily natural for me too, even through this cold decade I always ended up watching multiple Detroit games. Never liked the Blake Griffin trade, and I was about to give up watching Pistons ball last year until Weaver made a complete 180 as a GM that I've never seen before, it's like he's playing association mode, so yea I'm hooked again and was too hyped when we got the first pick. Our young players talk about winning and don't neglect the culture they are representing, that's making me even a greater fan. Trying to get my hands on Jerami Grant jersey at the moment."
Cade is already their 2nd highest paid active player after Jerami Grant at 10 million+ a year. Rookie contracts are getting crazy lmao
They have the 2 they need lol. And is a playoff Gordon better than Jerami Grant that series?
Fultz and Jerami Grant became Maxey*
"No one knows but it‚Äôs provocative, gets the people goin!  (that‚Äôs the reason Jerami Grant joined us)"
I doubt he wanted to leave LA but Kuzma has always wanted the Jerami Grant approach to be able to Chuck up as many shots as he pleases.
"You have no idea what you are talking about.    year 1, they traded for Bynum that off season when Iggy left and Brand basically retired.   the intention was to add a star big man in his 20's to pair with Jrue and Thad.       That obviously ended horribly for them, but it wasn't a tank move.  That was swinging for the fences.   Even gave up a future 1 and a young big in Vucivic to make the deal happen.   Then yes, they dumped Jrue and picked up an injured Nerlens, drafted MCW and got a future pick.  That was the beginning of the ""tanking"" years.   Then the next year they draft Embiid who was supposed to miss an entire season, took Dario who was overseas and picked that 1st up that they had orginally sent for Bynum.  Turned into Shamet.  Year 2 of the tank saw them pick up a ton of future assets including the pick that became Mikal Bridges years later.    Somewhere in there we got a future unprotected Sac pick and two pick swaps; plus future 1's from OKC and Miami.   Process saw Jerami Grant, Roco, TJ, Holmes all become NBA players who have all signed multiple contracts since then.    Then Embiid's scan didn't look right and he was forced into a second foot surgery.   Hinkie takes Jah instead of a wing in the most anti Hinkie pick ever and it all unravels that fall.   That was year 3.   Hinkie resigns end of season.   BC comes in and immediately him and is minions burn through a treasure trove of assets and have nothing to show.  But he did sign vets and trade for them trying to win that 5th year."
People on this sub overrate the fuck outta gravity. Curry got outdueled by freakin Ja Morant! Imagine KD losing the play in game to Jerami Grant LMAO
"&gt; jerami grant  Grant is overrated as all hell on defense, and Gary Harris didn't even play until Game 6 of the Utah series, and was still injured the entire Clippers series. I think you're severely overestimating the impact those 2 players had on that playoff run."
"You're completely ignoring jerami grant and gary harris who were your 2 best defenders in the bubble. Gordon is a good defender but far from elite, good luck trying to do anything to lebron, KD, kawhi etc. I want jokic to win a ring but i just dont think this MPJ contract is the move, especially since MPJ is worthless on defense."
"Maybe I'm wrong, but I think 12 Tobias Harris-level players would be top-level contenders or title favorites. Using NBA-player rankings from ESPN, that would mean a starting 5 of like Mike Conley, Smart, DeRozen, Harris, Myles Turner. Bench would be some combination of Kyle Lowry, LaMelo Ball, Beddy Hield, Porzingis, Julius Randle, Michael Porter Jr., Jerami Grant, John Collins, and Clint Capela."
Maybe you should be more focused on Jerami Grant
I agree with Philly folks‚Ä¶ why would anyone want Jerami Grant?
Jerami Grant + filler &gt; Ben Simmons
Jerami Grant really made 4 straight 3s. Laker offense really relying on dwight.....
Ended the half with jerami grant getting super hot and Dwight Howard scoring a three wtf
God damn Jerami Grant!
If I was Jerami Grant and my team traded me for Ben Simmons I‚Äôd be low key insulted
"Maybe, but why didn't Jerami Grant just pull up around the free throw line? pistons had numbers, he was not being guarded, but instead he drove right into his own teammate at the basket"
Wtf jerami grant lol just pegged it at the backboard
Three way trade:  Lakers get Jerami Grant and Buddy Hield  Kings get Russell Westbrook and Trey Lyles  Pistons get THT and Marvin Bagley  Who says no? All three teams?
"You're just picking and choosing. Obviously the thunder were better with KD, he's a top 20 guy all time. Same with CP3. He brought the wiz to the playoffs with beal, then the lakers gave up good players for him+dinwiddie.  No one's saying he's MJ, but he has still provided value to teams over the course of his career. Empty stats are for guys like Jerami Grant, who happen to stuff the stat sheet on a team that constantly loses."
"""How much better would the Lakers be with Jerami Grant?""  r/nba post in T-Minus 2 hours"
"But yeah, the last 10 years have been completely abysmal for the Pistons. That season of Blake being the only bright spot.  Now trade Jerami Grant to us."
"What would you give up for Jerami Grant, if anything?"
"I don't really watch the Wizards much since they aren't on national TV. Would there be interest in Jerami Grant and if so, what would you guys give? Like theoretically would something like Thomas Bryant, Deni Avdija, and a protected first work in your mind? Not sure that works with the cap."
"I‚Äôm not yet a believer in Bridges‚Äôs three ball, and without it I think he might be a Jerami Grant caliber player.  But who knows what‚Äôs going on with MPJ‚Äôs back.  If I had to wager I‚Äôd pick MPJ to have a better career.  He shoots better than Miles does any particular thing."
jerami grant came back down to earth for most of last year. it was really just a 25 game start where he was playing great then fell off after that
grants pretty good he could help a lot of teams.  I'd take jerami grant  it's a pretty generous offer actually for a guy who isn't even playing
Jerami Grant
Feels like they're one piece away. A Larry Nance or jerami grant would put them comfortably in that territory
"Watching Shark Tank overall will give you a *terrible* idea of negotiations, but using that example, Morey is not asking 500k for 5%. He's asking ONE MILLION BILLION DOLLARS for 5% of a company that's selling boxed cat shit.  A guy who has resisted improving his game in any aspect for his entire career and now *won't even play* - and is not guaranteed to play for a new team either - is not worth Fox. Jerami Grant would be an overpay."
Jerami Grant
"I'll be happy to trade you a season fresh, ACTUAL ROY,  Ben Simmons for Cade.  And, because I have the holiday giving spirit in me, I'll take that Jerami Grant off your hands for a 2nd as well."
Getting Jerami Grant at this juncture kinda feels like a steal for the Sixers.
Morey must think he trading Joel Embiid. There is no way he actually believes that Ben is worth as much as Cade Cunningham AND Jerami Grant
"Ben Simmons is a bigger villain in this. But holy fuck Morey just continues to whittle down his respect. Is this guy the most arrogant prick? I know it only takes one dumb owner/GM - but is anyone falling for this bullshit? Does he think he can speak it into existence? Jerami Grant + #1 pick Cade Cunningham for Ben Simmons would still be ""a tough proposition for Philly to say yes to""? Give me a fucking break."
"Damn, this place is getting really deluded in terms of Simmons' value. Sure, he's an idiot for acting the way he is but there is no way in hell Jerami Grant is worth a one for one deal for Simmons. Grant is about as average an NBA player as you can get who is actually playing quite a bit worse than he did last season. Dude has a 51.8% true shooting percentage. There is nothing 'great' about that potential deal, Pistons would be committing grand larceny."
Jerami Grant for Simmons is actually reasonable...
"&gt; The Boston Celtics have offered the Detroit Pistons multiple first-round picks for forward Jerami Grant, according to James Edwards III of The Athletic. ‚ÄúI believe the Celtics have offered multiple first for him (Grant),‚Äù Edwards said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what multiple means. It could be two. It could be three.‚Äù  still, your point stands."
"Y‚Äôall being so fixated on a return in this trade is the disconnect lol. No team wants Simmons. He‚Äôs a bum who doesn‚Äôt want to play basketball. I expect him to not play until someone‚Äôs desperate enough to make a good trade for the sixers, or until his contract ends. Acting like jerami fucking grant is gonna take this team from second round exit to championship is dumb."
"From what I know definitely not, for a few reasons:  - Pistons organization views Jerami Grant as a centrepiece - rejected three first round picks last deadline  - Pistons also view Saddiq Bey as a centrepiece, calling him part of the ‚ÄúCore 4‚Äù  - Pistons can‚Äôt trade any firsts as its currently owed to OKC  - Theyre trying to tank this year, and they‚Äôre angling to free up cap space for 2023/2024 off-seasons  - Organization keeps speaking about ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù and how talent doesn‚Äôt matter if their character isn‚Äôt what they‚Äôre looking for   - Theyre building around Cade Cunningham as the franchise star   But I‚Äôll say, Weaver hasn‚Äôt been afraid to make moves (traded literally everyone on the roster, Killian‚Äôs the longest tenured Piston) and he loves taking chances on highly drafted players that need fresh starts (Okafor, Josh Jackson, Trey Lyles, Dennis Smith Jr, rumors of Bagley).   He also makes calls to every team about everything so even if this ‚Äúinterest‚Äù was true he was prolly doing due diligence."
"Yeah, that's fine. But the question here that Morey is answering is basically ""What is the difference between a 1st round playoff loss and a 2nd round playoff loss?"" And he's answering it with ""Not much.""   Unless a player moves the needle significantly towards ""Championship"" then there's no reason to make that deal.   And let's be honest here...the difference between *this* Simmons-less 76ers team and healthy versions of Miami, Milwaukee, and Brooklyn is not negligible right now. Marcus Smart and parts doesn't move that needle. Jerami Grant doesn't move that needle.  Neither of those guys gets you to the conference finals, let alone to a title. Maybe it puts you ahead of Chicago or Charlotte or Atlanta in round 1, but **maybe not.**   That's not good enough. It's better to lose in round 1 with Simmons sitting at his house than lose in round 2 with Jerami Grant. The downgrade in championship equity is massive there."
Bro this is getting ridiculous. Jerami Grant is a great deal
He didn't go small against Portland until the last quarter of the last game either lmao.  Took him so long to figure out Jerami Grant is a good small ball 5.
"Why? Worst case scenario you get a 25 year old Draymond green, one of the best all around defenders in the league and can be a good secondary playmaker next to Cade. At best you get a young allstar for Jerami grant."
I‚Äôm interested in Jerami Grant
"Thinking Grant is a bad fit isn't bad per se. It's team analysis, and yes, Ben Simmons *is* better than Jerami Grant, even if he half asses every game. The awfully hilarious part is exactly that he legit thinks Cade AND Grant are not good enough of a package.  ""Nah fam, how about Cade, Grant, Hayes and an unprotected FRP?"""
"The recent report out of Philly was a pretty good indicator of why nothing's going to happen until they lower their standards.  &gt;[Amick] A source with knowledge of the list said there are approx 30 players who would satisfy the 76ers in a Simmons swap, &amp; there‚Äôs an internal belief that a fair amount of them ‚Äîlet‚Äôs say 5 to 10‚Äî could become available in the next year or 2. ‚ÄúThis is like a multi-year thing‚Äù a Sixers source said  That was released in a ""see we're not being unrealistic and actually have a very open mind"" sort of way.   When you actually think about what that means, it's a 30 team league so Philadelphia is essentially asking for the best or second-best player from a decent team, with bad teams not even having a player who qualifies.     WEST | EAST ---|--- Steph + Klay (GSW)|Harden + Durant (BRK) Paul + Booker (PHO)|Beal (WAS) Mitchell (UTA)|LaVine (CHI)  Luka (DAL)|Butler (MIA) Murray (DEN)|LaMelo (CHO) Kawhi + George (LAC)|Garland (CLE) Ja (MEM)|Tatum + Brown (BOS) Dame (POR)|Siakam (TOR) LeBron (LA)|Giannis + Middleton + Jrue (MIL) SGA (OKC)|Trae (ATL) Edwards (MIN)| Fox (SAC)|    That's 30 names already and there are a lot of really good names still not on that list.  We're not counting centers (Jokic, Towns, Davis, Bam) because of their fit next to Embiid.   We're not counting rookies because apparently the timeline of rookies like Cade Cunningham ""would make that a tough proposition for Philly to say yes to.""  We're also not counting dozens of high-end secondary pieces like Tyrese Haliburton and Jerami Grant, who originally were names people assumed would be included.  There isn't a single realistic name on that list."
They have been good this year until embiid got covid but I get you point. Its also funny that sixers fans get shit on for overvaluing simmoms when half the sub thinks simmons for jerami grant is the craziest trade of all time becuase Simmons is so bad.  Maybe they will get a star maybe they wont but I am optimistic.
"""Here is a somewhat reasonable offer"" followed by ""no thanks, here is a completely unreasonable alternative"" is not how negotiation works lmao. A package centered on Jerami Grant is a good faith attempt to begin negotiations and a package centered around Cade is like Morey ripping ass into the speakerphone and hanging up"
Why the fuck would they trade Simmons for Jerami Grant though lmao
"Can‚Äôt waste Embiid‚Äôs prime, need to trade for Jerami Grant ASAP for the easy ring"
It‚Äôs not the fact he doesn‚Äôt want Jerami Grant. It‚Äôs the fact that for him to even consider it Cade needs to be included.
"So I'm reading this as Jerami Grant is on the trade block. And he's a solid piece to go after if you're a contender. Maybe not the Sixers but I'd be intrigued in making an offer for him, especially if he is being looked at like a bad contract."
"How does he have no choice and how will his value be lower than now as time passes? 1. Simmons has 4 years on his contract and the Sixers don‚Äôt have to trade him, and the Sixers aren‚Äôt exactly starving without him. Trading for a player like Jerami grant won‚Äôt help them win a title, which given Embiid‚Äôs window, is the only thing that matters. Simmons continues to sit out, the Sixers have just as good of a chance of winning the title as if they trade him for grant: next to none.   2. I fail to see how teams getting desperate will mean they will be less inclined to trade for Simmons. That is counter intuitive logic. Nobody is looking for a trade at this point in the season."
"You still don‚Äôt trade an all-star and arguably best defender in the league for Jerami Grant, especially now. Teams get desperate around the trade deadline. 76ers obviously won‚Äôt get the same haul they would have a year ago, but if you think the Sixers should sell when the value is at the all-time low, then might I interest you in r/wallstreetbets?"
"Simmons is only barely worth a 2nd round draft pick, let alone Jerami Grant.  Morey has got to be the worst GM of all time."
"To be fair I think they‚Äôd fit pretty well together. They‚Äôre different types of forwards, with Grant the much better defender and can play off ball while Tobias the better playmaker  Having had both Tobias and Jerami on my team, I think Jerami‚Äôs the better player - Jerami‚Äôs the type of dude every team would love cause he‚Äôll match up with the Lebron‚Äôs, Kawhis, Luka‚Äôs of the world and do a good job."
"I dont think Nba gms care that you think ben simmons sucks. I also think simmons sucks, but I believe they will get back a better player than jerami grant.  You can say morey is misplaying it, but maybe wait until the actual trade because this speculation is straight stupid."
Killian Hayes is a lottery pick too‚Ä¶ and + jerami grant.
Jerami Grant has zero evidence of him ever being viable as anything more than a 3 and D player on a playoff team. He is just putting up pretty stats on a horrible Detroit team and he is shooting 40% from field and 30% from 3
Jerami Grant would be a great fit with Philly.  Morey is being ridiculous if he thinks hes going to get a much better return at this point.
"They should not be, Jerami Grant is a super high end role player and is posting one of his worst shooting seasons as well. Ben Simmons is still a young star in the league, a premier playmaker, and a elite defensive player"
Is jerami Grant not a good second option?
If Jerami Grant wants out (very possible given the age difference between him and Cade) I think he will wait until next off-season. More options.
Pistons fan here- Jerami Grant has been a black hole on offense for us. His play this year has definitely hurt his trade value after a solid season last year.
"Cade is really impressive. He should take more shots honestly, Jerami Grant is not that guy"
Pistons fans.. why is jerami grant taking way more shots than cade every game.. like when he's efficient let him shoot the ball!!
I think Nunn is probably more important. And try to trade Westbrook for Jerami Grant somehow lol
I can‚Äôt wait til Cade Cunningham doesn‚Äôt have Jerami grant as a teammate.
Jerami Grant ranks Wiggins Island a 0 out of 10 stars. Hoping to never vacation there again
I wish we could get Jerami Grant for Westbrook. Pistons just need a guard to run that offense and help those guys play and we need Jerami Grant so much I'll kidnap him if he doesn't do it!
Jerami Grant fits that description to a T
Jerami Grant isn't enjoying himself at all on Wiggins Island. Worst vacation ever
I‚Äôd rather have Jerami Grant as a 1st option for 1 game than KPJ rn
"Oh, I thought it was the Grant trade from what [I read](https://www.nba.com/thunder/news/jerami-grant-161101)  Might be mistaken haha"
For the Sixers getting Jerami Grant and Saben Lee or something would be a solid return because the value is only tanking from here
Ben Simmons + Shake Milton = Pistons   Kelly Olynyk + Harrison Barnes + Saddiq Bey = 76ers  Jerami Grant = Kings
"Two players I'd love to see traded are Jerami Grant and Harrison Barnes but I don't see Grant specifically getting traded.  I felt awful for Denver when he didn't resign, but apparently a huge thing for Grant is he wanted to play for a black coach/GM and be a huge advocate for black outreach in Detroit. He really wanted to be there and if Detroit trades them it'd gut their FA reputation (and they already don't get FAs anyways)"
"I was going to say that that just isn‚Äôt fair.... but then I thought about it. Jeremi grant is definitely a piece that can be built around someone else, but yeah, you definitely cannot build around jerami grant"
The only thing you can build around Jerami Grant is a tank lol
"former sixer 2nd rounder jerami grant, traded away by guess who? bryan ""long collars"" colangelo  imagine if you told a sixer fan a few years back we'd be trying to trade ben for jerami"
It is weird to think Jerami Grant and Wood were rookies on the same 76ers team. If only the 76ers gave them a little more time.
"He's like Jerami Grant but worse. Can't be anything better than a fourth option on a championship squad, but with his poor defense and the need to have the ball he doesn't belong on a contender. He'll be a lottery god for the next few years."
"PG: Trae, Ja, Fox*, Schroeder   SG: Sexton, Mitchell, Jalen Green  SF: Lavine, Jaylen Brown, Ant Edwards  PF: Zion, Giannis, Jerami Grant   C: KAT, Bam, Turner   *idk if Fox is still as fast, after he bulked up he looks a lot slower"
Jerami Grant
They can only trade 3 FRPs and all of them will be later than pick 25. That‚Äôs not that valuable. Shit the fuckin Pistons rejected 3 late firsts for Jerami Grant from Boston

Jerami Grant is perfect example that you can't rank players based on volume stats.
I‚Äôll give them Jerami grant and Corey Joseph for ben simmons and their first round pick this year Lmfaoo
I want this team to win a championship. They have the ‚Äúwant‚Äù that most teams don‚Äôt have. They all have chips on their shoulders. I just think they need one more solid piece to fill that PF spot. I‚Äôm hoping that they can steal Jerami Grant away from Detroit or maybe Kyle Anderson.
"Looking back at that 2016-17 OKC roster now is pretty funny. A rookie Sabonis, Oladipo, Alex Caruso, a young Doug McDermott and young Jerami Grant.  In fairness looking back, a lot of their young players have gone on to be pretty good."
"The problem with Westbrook comparisons is that he's all or nothing. The man will carry or throw games. He might average out around Jerami Grant tier, but that's not really accurate."
"Hamidou ain't a difference maker. The top 5 teams have rosters full of Jerami Grant or better-level players. That's what we should be aiming for, not counting on the trash on our roster to be anything more than tank commanders."
"He‚Äôs one of those guys I feel like, you give him minutes and he‚Äôll grow fast. Jerami Grant. Richaun Holmes."
"I think this is the ideal lineup:   PG: Jrue Holiday   SG: Jimmy Butler   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Jerami Grant    C: Dwight Howard   That team is filthy defensively, then you have a bench of Horford, Wood, Holmes, McConnell, Fultz, Ish Smith, and George Hill. If we're ranking off of talent alone, Hill/Horford/Wood arguably have higher peaks than Jerami Grant, but Grant is needed to fix that very tenuous spacing, plus he's a more versatile defender who fits alongside Dwight."
Our best bet is to get a Chauncey or Jerami Grant type player. Someone who just needs a chance to prove themself
"Jerami Grant may not be a star, but he's more than what most get."
Jerami Grant too
"The current starting lineup:  Cade Cunningham   Killian Hayes (or Diallo/Jackson for some)  Saddiq Bey  Jerami Grant  Isaiah Stewart  It‚Äôs just they can‚Äôt hit a thing so far this year, and Casey is up to his usual fuckery"
"They wouldn't be the best by any means, but you could build a solid team from former sixers. A lot of the process guys turned out to be damn good elsewhere.  PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: Butler  SF: RoCo  PF: Jerami Grant  C: Christian Wood  Bench: Richaun Holmes, Fultz, Dario, Nerlens Noel, Iguadala, T.J McConnell, Thaddeus Young"
"Nah I feel you SGA, Mobley, and Jerami Grant fucked me over tonight"
"At the expense of Jerami Grant maybe.  I kinda am surprised he's not as much of a shooter or playmaker as we thought.  He can get buckets no doubt, but I thought he was gonna be a better shooter and passer."
Didn't watch the game. Only looked at the box score. What's happening with Jerami Grant?
"Yeah, it's cause 75% of the roster is trash and needs to be replaced. And the remaining 25% are 1st and 2nd year players, and Jerami Grant."
"Which is why personally im in the camp where we should trade them and try again. Or go for a smaller, less risky move. Someone like Jerami Grant albeit he's obviously not on the trade block"
"Yeah idk where this idea that Jokic has been playing with scrubs comes from. Multiple players the Nuggets had coming off the bench (Jerami Grant, Malik Beasley, MPJ, Plumlee) are now starters. .  Jokic has always had a really good supporting cast"
"Yeah, though i think Jokic is honestly a factor in that. He‚Äôs so dominant but so selfless as a star that you really can‚Äôt be a huge headcase there, it stands out like a sore thumb. A lot of that is because Denver is VERY intentional about targeting personalities who fit in there for the most part, but you notice how guys tend to really buy into the system there. You wouldn‚Äôt have a KAT-Ant situation where a young guy basically hijacks the team with Jokic. And even guys who wanted to do that, ie Jerami Grant, played a role when actually in Denver then left when they wanted to be the guy instead of making a scene in Denver. Jokic epitomizes a team-first winning culture/lead by example in basically all aspects and that rubs off on the whole team"
"The thunder with Oladipo, Sabonis(coulda still made the PG trade), Jerami Grant and Al Horford would've had a good shot."
"Well you had 4 players that were all stars (randle, lavine, jokic, and embiid). Then you have alot of great role players that came from the draft like Wiggins, smart, Gordon, capela, warren, Nurkic, Bogdonavic, joe Harris, dinwiddie, jerami grant. And Clarkson. That's a lot of money if you stack it.  That's a solid draft that produced alot of good players and 4 all stars. There are more disappointing draft classes than this one. Its just that Parker and wiggins didn't turn out what they expected to be"
"I never understood why so much Denver fans were kind of saying he was overpaid or overrated, I thought they would be happy for Jerami Grant!"
"Jerami Grant, Blake and Saddiq bey all looked really good today"
The only thing that can stop the Suns is Michigan's oppressively grey winters. And Jerami Grant.
"hello, i'm here to fight anyone that still thinks Jerami Grant is being overpaid."
"In brief, offensively he's a better shooter from everywhere except at the rim (though even there Jokic is great). Jokic is a better passer which I think sort of goes without saying, both in terms of skill but also passing instincts and placement. Jokic also because of his touch and skill has a more versatile offensive game than Giannis. He can dominate a game with just passing and only scoring a few points, which I don't think Giannis can do. He can decide to dominate by just posting dudes up, or if that doesnt work, can face up and shoot or create from the post, top of the key, the elbow, or wherever. He literally is the Nuggets system in a way that even still I don't think Giannis is - in this way I compare him to Peyton Manning. From an outside perspective at least, the Bucks system seems to be a bit... my turn your turn, Giannis does a drive or PnR, then perhaps Khris Middleton runs a spread PnR, then Jrue (formerly Bled). I could be a bit wrong, and it's undoubtedly been highly effective in the regular season, but Giannis has obvious limitations on offense that even his otherworldly athletic ability hasnt been able to over come yet in the playoffs...  Which leads me to my next bit - Jokic consistently has improved each year, if in more marginal ways than Giannis. But I'm a bit concerned Giannis might be plateauing - it doesnt really seem like he's added anything substantive to his game this year so far, his touch from 3, midrange, and FTs isnt any better or worse than it was last year. Whereas Jokic more than anything, this year, looks just in command of the team and the game. His skills offensively are the same but he's transitioning into an even more active role dictating where he wants his teammates to go, what they need to do. Similarly, Jokic consistently grades out as one of the very best players in the NBA in the clutch - shooting something like 72% in the last two minutes of games and OT, while he also elevates his defense in those moments. In 33 playoff games, Jokic has also been incredible, averaging 25/11/7 on 55/42/84 shooting splits in 38 mpg (so he doesnt get played off the floor at all and only commits slightly less than 4 fouls per game), along with 1.1 steals and 0.8 bpg. Giannis we can remove his first playoff run I think - the last 4 years then, which is 37 playoff games, comparable to Jokic, Giannis averages... 25/11/5 on 55/32.5/63 splits, with 1.1 steals and 1.5 blocks. All this is to show that Jokic's game elevates in the playoffs and the clutch, while Giannis's has been great, but not quite as great as in the regular season.  Defensively of course Giannis is incredible (though I think somewhat poorly used by Bud at times - I don't understand his refusal to at least in the playoffs unleash Giannis as an isolation defender), he's a superior player to Jokic there in every way. Jokic isn't bad defensively, however, is my only point. I won't belabor it but the Nuggets always have graded out better with him on the floor than off defensively, in a whole host of metrics. Jokic is a good post defender, good positionally, smart, good rebounder, etc.  The last two points I have are simply - the game is about getting buckets, and longevity. Jokic I think, as an offensive system unto himself, gets buckets for himself and others at a rate that's literally as good as anyone in the game. Part of my evidence for this - there are only 3 players Jokic has ever played with who have been a net negative when paired with him, and one is Emmanuel Mudiay. The others? Trey Lyles and Jerami Grant. Two of those guys are *barely* NBA players. He just makes everyone he plays with better, for the most part, if they're at least competent. That's probably true of Giannis though too, in different ways. Defensively, and in terms of lightening the load offensively like Jokic. Which is why I mention longevity - Giannis blessedly hasnt had any injuries yet, really, but his game is predicated on athleticism, while Jokic's is not. On balance, my hunch is this means Jokic's game will age better than Giannis's. If he doesnt get bored or tired of playing, Jokic could play till he's 40 like Dirk did and still be effective offensively at least, considering his game is quite low impact. Meanwhile for Giannis the model is clearly LeBron - but LeBron is a better passer, always has been really... and LeBron really learned how to shoot at least well enough that defenses have to respect his shot. Giannis could do that still, but so far he's just been... well, a horrible shooter, every year except his rookie year. And his FT% has gotten worse every year too which doesn't bode well.   Damn I said I'd be brief but look at that, I wrote an essay."
Have we ever beat jerami grant?? Guy has our number! Gg pistons
"love jerami, but we got him likely to play as the #2 guy to one of the many young, projected stars coming in the next two drafts.  the fact that we're staying competitive and winning games like this is really entertaining as a fan, but it'll be even more entertaining when we have cade or emoni (optimistically) out there alongside grant, bey, sekou, hayes and stew"
"Literally no reason for the refs to rig the game for the pistons. But Mark Davis was awful tonight I will give you that.  Still the Suns went so cold from 3 and never looked to take the ball inside, this ones on them. Plus their awful ft shooting. Jerami Grant impressed me so much too."
Jerami Grant
Jerami Grant.
Let‚Äôs go into the mind of a Jerami Grant
Jerami Grant playing like his uncle Horse
I don't know why everyone is so shocked Jerami Grant picked us over the Nuggets.  He wanted a chance to beat the top teams in the West.
"I have so much respect for Jerami Grant right now. He bet on himself to be the number one guy and has been putting up the results. After a poor Pistons debut with just 9 points he‚Äôs been insane. Averaging 26.7 PPG in 8 games since, his lowest scoring game in that stretch was 22 points too."
Jerami Grant oh my
Jerami Grant vs Book
Jerami Grant.... is good.
Huge plays from Jerami Grant late
"He is not as good as Giannis defensively, but he is in no way a ""black hole"" on defense. In no way. I'm tired of typing this, but the Nuggets have routinely, for the LAST FOUR YEARS graded out better defensively with him on the floor than off, in terms of net ratings, advanced numbers, all of it. He routinely rates in the positive on DBPM, usually \~+1.2 or so, which is solidly above average, and certainly not the black hole that people perceive him as. He's positionally sound, he has quick hands to get steals, and he's improved his lateral quickness. He struggles with one specific archetype: a HYPER quick and fast guard paired with a superb PnR lob finisher. Not many teams have both. And honestly even there he's gotten better.   The Lakers didnt exploit him in the playoffs nearly as much as the Jazz tried to attack him honestly. The Lakers simply had LeBron James who outweighs Jerami Grant by about 40 lbs - Grant couldnt do anything against him (and even when he was in good position, Grant would get called for a block)."
He's been an incredible pick up for my fantasy team.  God bless Jerami Grant.
"idk why yall are hating on the pistons offseason, they signed two superstars in mason plumlee and jerami grant, who else would be getting these calls?"
I‚Äôm only asking because I saw someone else call it his mvp season while talking about Jerami Grant. I‚Äôm mostly shocked that it‚Äôs stuck with fans.
If Jerami Grant is getting 20 mil and Hayward is getting 30 than Russ would get at least 25 probably
I agree. If Jerami Grant could get $20 mil/yr than Westbrook could surely get more
"To be fair, it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs being massively efficient or creating for others while doing so.  The criticism against him being the #1 option is that he had never in his career previously shown any indication to consistently create shots for others and very rarely to be able to create shots for himself.  Watching him drive and try to take dudes off the dribble or to post guys up last year was like watching a baby giraffe learning to walk. Jerami grant post ups had to have been the least efficient possessions of any action Denver ran last year.  I‚Äôm happy for him doing what makes him happy and following his heart with the BLM movement, but I‚Äôm not sure being a volume scorer (26% usg) with splits of 44/34/90 (.27 FTr) and posting 6 boards and 1.6 assists on a 1-7 team is really proving anything or anyone wrong.  ‚ÄúBut he doubled his points!‚Äù Yeah, by taking well more than twice the shots.  Sometimes, I feel like a lot of this sub just watches box scores and doesn‚Äôt care at all about efficiency or team fit or anything like that."
Bro because to say Jerami Grant is better than Booker or Mitchell is incrediblely stupid. Just started watching basketball this year did we?
Max obviously. Jerami Grant was a role player at Denver and got 20m.
Statistically? Christian Wood. Playstyle? Jerami Grant or Darius Bazley  I think Anthony Davis is a rich man's Marion actually.
I think consensus amongst Pistons fans is that he's young enough to absorb into our already super young core. We had 3 first round picks and a high second round this year and we're likely looking at another high lottery pick next draft. I just don't see why the Pistons would move him unless it was a top tier pick and even then I'm not sure we would.     Like if you hit on one of those draft picks they might turn into...Jerami Grant? Kind of unlikely to scoop a prospect with a higher ceiling without it being a top pick.
That‚Äôs actually not true  https://theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/  Tldr He wanted to play for a black coach and black gm in a black city. Still more reasons he wouldn‚Äôt want to go to the Celtics though.
"It makes me sad that all of these guys played in Hinkie's last year with the Sixers and are turning out to have been good choices by him (even beyond guys like Embiid, or the pick that was about to become Simmons):  * Jerami Grant * Robert Covington * TJ McConnell * Richaun Holmes * Christian Wood * [the rights to] Dario Saric * lots of extra picks  The team was really gutted in the era between Hinkie and Morey (yes, they have Tobias Harris and had one year of Jimmy Butler to show for it, but it makes me sad whenever I think about what Hinkie could have maybe done with the team he had in 2016)."
Jerami Grant was a raw player in OKC with athleticism and length over his time in NBA he played games learn to be an effective player. On the Nuggets last year he prove he can bring value to a playoff team to be part of a rotation. Any winning team trying to go to playoffs to make some noise would love him to be on the rotation. Don't know when the Pistons are going to be in the next 2 season.
"I'll say this:  Unlike Bruce Brown (or Jodie Meeks for the older fans out here), Jerami Grant does NOT look good just because he's a decent player on a bad roster.  He looks legit, period!"
"You know with the amount of people I saw shit on his contract, I‚Äôm here for any jerami grant positivity."
Jerami Grant was a tough loss.

Surely Jerami Grant is in this conversation as well
I really want the Jerami Grant MIP narrative to gain some traction
Jerami Grant deserves some respect.
‚ÄúFuck it let‚Äôs throw 20M at Jerami Grant‚Äù
"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
"Fr how could the sixers let so many good pieces go (C wood, jerami grant, roco, etc.)"
"Who should I believe, Jerami Grant himself, or a random redditor?"
Jerami Grant is moveable for picks playing at his current level
I dunno. Jerami Grant chose to come here lol.
"Exactly. I still don't think our original intention was to tank. Vincent Goodwill reported Weaver was trying to sign FVV too.  At this point I think we'll head towards tanking but that's more the result of Blake and Rose sucking ass this year.   If at the beginning of the season, you thought Rose would play like he did last year, Blake would play like 2 years ago + Jerami Grant would become a 23 ppg scorer on monster efficiency, you'd think that'd be a .400-.500 team."
Then why sign vets like Jerami grant and mason plumlee? And Wood on 11M a year has insane trade value.
‚ÄúAh yes...i can rest now...Jerami Grant is out of the way‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"I'm not gonna say greatest game, but as for ones I've watched, LMA dropping 50+ on Steven Adams head to win the game in OT was great. i remember Derrick White getting a chasedown block on Jerami Grant who was destroying us basically to win the game. probably the most fun I've had watching a regular season game."
"i know you probably meant this rhetorically but we can actually answer it using NBA stats' 2-man lineups tool - this wouldnt be specific to PnR defense but defense in general measured with points per 100 poss (drtg or defensive efficiency)  Melo and Kanter have played 99 mins together, if we only allow duos with equal or greater sample size we have these LINEUPS:   .D. Russell, .N. Reid  *P. Tucker, .C. Wood* (128.6 drtg)  .J. Harden, .C. Wood  .P. Tucker, .J. Harden  .D. Russell, .J. Culver  .O. Porter Jr., .W. Carter Jr.  .P. Millsap, .G. Harris  .D. DeRozan, .D. Murray  **C. Anthony, .E. Kanter** (123.8 drtg)  *N. Jokic, .M. Porter Jr.* (123.5 drtg)  *P. Millsap, .N. Jokic* (123.0 drtg)  .D. DeRozan, .L. Walker IV  *B. Griffin, .J. Grant* (122.1 drtg)   So it looks like theyre competing with Tucker/Wood (probably more on wood but no idea bc i cant watch rockets games without missing him on our team) and Porter/Carter (though Lavine is also a terrible defender which screws them over).   In the same vicinity are both Jokic/Millsap and Jokic/porter, but millsap is probably an unfortunate victim, and blake/jerami grant who are in kind of a shit situation anyway"
Lol why would a second year player who had a good rookie year be the MIP? Jerami Grant or Wood are more realistic.
"Need to trade Barton for a wing defender, then cut someone else to make room for Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. Gotta replace Torrey Craig and Jerami Grant defensive presence."
Im still perplexed that Jerami Grant would rather average 20 points on the worst team in the league than be the 4th option on a contender.
"Steven Adams, Victor Oladipo, Andre Roberson, and Jerami Grant is not a ""very bad team"" if you add ANY all star player"
"I have. I've watched all the Piston games, as well as all the Nugget games from last season. Jerami Grant is the same player. He's improved his ball handling a smidge, but that's about it. He's the same player, just taking more shots."
"who‚Äôs shitting on YOU? i simply think this post is stupid. Jerami Grant was getting all the respect he deserved last season, no ones gonna give him more for turning himself from solid piece on a contender to first option on a bad team + trade bait"

If he puts together any kind of offensive game he'd be a very good asset to any team. Extremely adept defender and has a decent handle for his size. Depending on the development of his shot he could fill a role similar to Jerami Grant or Derrick Jones Jr.

If jerami grant ends the season averaging more than Anthony Davis I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôll react
How long before Detroit trades us Jerami Grant for scraps
Jerami Grant is also one of the best on ball defenders of Kawhi too. Losing him really really hurts
"jerami grant has reeeally impressed me so far. dude bet on himself, i didn‚Äôt buy it, and he‚Äôs shown up and is proving all the doubters wrong"
Jerami Grant
"I mean we haven‚Äôt been a great team in general, and we were BAD in that loss, but from the two games I saw, the Pistons looked way better than their record.  Jerami Grant is for real, and they have a lot of other decent players."
Jerami Grant has shown a lot so far in Detroit.  Way more juice off the dribble than I expected and making tough shots at the rim with either hand.  If his 3-point % ticks back up a bit he could be an absolute monster.
"yeah mvp westbrook had dipo, a young sabonis, a young jerami grant    of course they were not the $20m contract level players that they are now but they were widely regarded as being pretty talented, lots of archived game threads' comments prove that"

"Richaun Holmes, Dario saric, Jerami grant, Zach Lavine, Markelle Fultz, tj McConnell, kristaps porzingis, devonte graham, Roco, Ja, nerlens noel"
"so many players right now that are fun to watch, i'm gonna throw out a couple that maybe aren't as expected.  Lu Dort - love watching him clamp down on the best offensive player on the other team. he can get hot too and pour in points in a hurry though he is streaky offensively.  Jerami Grant - dude is taking his game to the next level in detroit. he's so long and bouncy and his handle and shot are better than you might anticipate."
Like Jerami Grant and OG Anunoby

"To be fair, we‚Äôve done it the past 2 seasons lol.  Jokic really isn‚Äôt as bad on defense as most think he is.  We definitely miss jerami grant for sure, but another factor with our defense is how many new guys we have that we are trying to work into the rotation. Defense gets hurt the most there since that‚Äôs much more of a team thing. Especially without a real training camp to gel."
"&gt;That's not really insane on its own, elite forwards that focus mostly on drives shoot around 70% on 2s over a season.   Surely you're conflating percentage at the rim with all 2s, right?  LeBron James (earlier in his career) and Giannis Antetokounmpo, basically the dictionary definition of ""elite forwards that focus mostly on drives"" have never topped 62% or 64% on 2 pointers respectively.  70% is on par with centers who don't shoot outside of 3 feet, like Mitchell Robinson.    Regardless, you're totally right that it is the mid-range scoring that makes this so special.  This is an absolutely absurd scoring streak that he's on.  He's drilling contested fadeaway jumpers from the free throw line on out, he's lighting it up from three, he's putting guys like Jerami Grant in a spin cycle, it looks like he's in an empty gym out there.  He's going to be gunning hard for an All Star spot this year."
Might I interest them in a Jerami Grant
What are the Piston‚Äôs plans though? They used up most of their cap space taking on Blake Griffin and Jerami grant for what purpose? To maybe be the 10th seed for the next few years? They need to tank and use the space to take on bad contracts for picks  Too many teams fall into this trap trying to overpay middling players to remain mediocre and it only delays the rebuild
Just so we‚Äôre clear I would trade for a guy who helps the Pistons long term more yes. Shouldn‚Äôt be a difficult concept to grasp you need multiple pick and roll operators and playmakers to have a good offense in the nba unless you have someone like James harden. Jerami Grant also isn‚Äôt this defensive stopper you seem to be conceiving of him as he‚Äôs solid he‚Äôs not some elite defender
Maybe Vert for Jerami Grant or try RoCo
Better playmaker better operating out of the pick and roll. Jerami Grant also isn‚Äôt someone long term you want on wings defensively even if he‚Äôs ok at it he really should be a 4 defensively over the long run.   I‚Äôm not even a Caris LeVert fan but once Grant regresses offensively and once Derrick Rose is dealt or gone from the team I would rather have LeVerts playmaking and ability to operate out of a pick and roll than Grants for a rebuilding team
Caris LeVert for Jerami Grant once he cools off  This is also where no dinwiddie reallly sucks he was the most direct trade asset   Also they should be badgering Houston‚Äôs phone lines for pj Tucker once James harden is dealt which will still happen
"The Pistons broadcasters at one point were like ""let's see what Denver thinks of Jerami Grant now""  ....they literally offered him the same money and he chose to walk!!! How are people not getting this?!"
Can i take just a moment of your time to talk about future all-star Jerami Grant?
"Anyone interested in commenting on Jerami Grant? He is a bonafide asset and would fit on any contending team. If Detroit wants, they can get a nice haul for him."
Jerami Grant is really good
Jerami Grant is better than Pascal Siakam.
I'm not watching the game but I just wanted to say that I'm happy for Jerami Grant and hope he continues to ball out in Detroit
"Wood got passed over by 3 other teams. This isnt an indictment on brown.     On a separate note, both jerami grant and christian wood got lost in the shuffle in the process and are looking like stars in the small sample we have so far this year. Interesting starts for both"
"PG: Ish Smith/TJ McConnell  SG: Robert Covington/Tony Wroten  SF: Jerami Grant/Nik Stauskas  PF: Christian Wood/Jahlil Okafor  C: Richaun Holmes/Nerlens Noel  Team would still be pretty bad, but they'd at least be competitive these days."
I like Dr. Doum for Sekou if he becomes good. I want something for Jerami Grant if he doesn't have anything already and I don't think Blake Griffin has a nickname either.
So they didn‚Äôt wanna pay him more than 11 mil but did want to pay Jerami grant 20 mil?
Jerami Grant #1/2 wow
They're missing Jerami Grant
Jerami Grant by the end of the year is a possibility. Especially considering he is great on both ends of the floor.
"A good recent quote going around from top soccer manager Jose Mourinho fits this situation perfectly: A top player will perform in any system no matter the role they're asked to play.   Jerami Grant has been doing just that, previously with the Nuggets and now starting off this year and like he says, he is still learnign and growing."
Mikal Bridges Jaylen Brown Christian Wood SGA Jerami Grant
"Yeah I mean I‚Äôm not saying they wouldn‚Äôt have a case. But for me I look more at a guy like Christian wood or jerami grant. Who are players we‚Äôve known about for a little bit but because of a different situation or role their game has went up a ton. You look at Ja, Zion, and even herro in the bubble we already know they are capable of some big time stuff. Zion and Ja showed they can be all stars. Herro has shown that when he‚Äôs hot he can score at will. I just think that because we know what they‚Äôre capable of we already expect higher"
Jerami Grant
"&gt;‚ÄúStat padder‚Äù these days feels more like ‚Äúlowkey slander to players that I don‚Äôt like on a bad team‚Äù than an actual stat padder  That‚Äôs exactly what it means. I‚Äôve even see people accuse Jerami Grant of putting up ‚Äúempty stats‚Äù, strictly because they‚Äôre butthurt they were wrong about him being overpaid/overrated. It‚Äôs all about petty grievances and random gripes."
"They, in fact, just got beat by a wet paper bag + Jerami Grant"

No one saw Jerami Grant being this dirty ! He's killin it this year.
"You get better by taking thousands of them in the off-season. Not hopelessly chucking throughout games. Giannis does this and he has never had a better ft or 3p percentage than his rookie year. Point is giannis will never be a shooter no matter how many in game chucks he attempts. Jerami Grant marginally improved his 3 point shot (percentage and volume wise) last season in Denver with no in-game volume attempts. It makes absolutely no sense to shoot if he is 20% from that distance lol. No it's not ""keeping the defenses honest."" Giannis chucks those threes and they guard him the same exact way they do Ben. Defensive honesty isn't a thing for Ben.   I think the issue with the fanbase who misinterprets Ben is that they are way too fixated on his 3 point shot. I see a ton of other things he can improve on. Working off ball more, becoming a better cutter, adding a decent floater and mid range game, improving the free throw percentage, becoming more aggressive and getting more volume attempts at the rim. The fixation on him not taking low percentage shots is incredible"
"i looked up the stats a few hours ago to see if drose was a starter yet, and he's still coming off the bench for the majority of games.  but despite that he was the top ppg for the pistons last year, and is second this year to jerami grant.  guy's still got something in there."
"Without Jerami Grant, without Montrezl Harrel, and with Ibaka? Not to mention without Bubble Harris?"
Anyone else see glimpses of Shawn Kemp in Jerami Grant?
Ironically Jerami Grant is also gunning for that MIP. Dude is raging an allstar campaign right now.
Jerami ‚ÄúKawhi‚Äù Grant
I‚Äôve been irrationally optimistic Knox would figure it out. Was really hoping the Nuggets would swoop in and buy low on him. Got ripped for saying he could have a Jerami Grant like trajectory. Good to see him improving.   [Jerami Grant v. Knox first year stats. ](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=grantje01&amp;p1yrfrom=2015&amp;player_id2=knoxke01&amp;p2yrfrom=2019)
Since when did Jerami Grant turn into Andrei Kirilenko with a 3 point shot?
MIP is gonna me between Christian Wood and Jerami Grant and I‚Äôm proud if either of them win it
Would you trade pascal Siakam for John Collins(for the sake of this let‚Äôs say you could swap them 1 for 1 even though salary rules wouldn‚Äôt allow it)  If you really want to go bold what about Jerami Grant
"between him and wood, i‚Äôd have to give it to jerami for the insane defense. my only gripe about wood last year was his defense was lacking whereas grant truly brings it"
The amount of people saying Siakam is crazy. I‚Äôm definitely taking Jerami Grant over Siakam this year
"Jerami Grant : 24 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists, 4 blocks, 2 steals. Efficient night too. This guy is an all star."
Yikes thats a bad loss.      Jerami grant though. He can hoop
Jerami Grant is an all star
"Jerami Grant probably deserves it, but maybe won't. Kinda how it goes ya know?"
Picked Jerami Grant in both of my fantasy league around pick 70. He's been so good that I ordered a jersey. I hope you guys do well.
&gt; let him go without making a substantial offer  we have little idea what offers he got from Detroit.   people constantly say 'lol why would anyone want to play in Detroit' and then act like our franchise is incompetent when we don't re-sign an unrestricted FA. lol whatever  I guess we're just gonna have to keep hearing this every time the guy scores over 20 points (while Jerami Grant is averaging 25 points for us)
"Pisons: I got Jerami Grant, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Delon Wright, and Sekou. Outside of that I don't know anyone on that team lol."
"Pistons for me, I know Jerami Grant and Blake and that's it.  Every other team I can name at least 5 players."
pistons. jerami grant. killian hayes. blake griffin. uhhh mason plumlee yea it stops there
"Don't mind me, I'm just simping for Jerami Grant"
"The Jerami Grant example doesn‚Äôt really help your case, even with Randle as their best player, the Knicks were still very much in the lotto.  With the wacky odds even the Lakers got the fourth overall pick when they missed the playoffs despite having Lebron.  I mean Brooklyn has given up twice the amount of draft capital this go round than in 2013 which yielded Tatum, Brown and Sexton.  Getting 1, 2 or 3 of those between 2022-2027 isn‚Äôt particularly unrealistic.  Even the most competent franchises have bumps in the road like the Warriors last season, Miami after Lebron left (Cleveland too), the Spurs after Kawhi etc..."
"True, but it doesn't even have to be a star. It could be like a Jerami Grant, a Julius Randle, a Christian Wood.  If the Nets have cap space they could also take an overpaid slightly over the hill player like a Horford. Also you're not relying on no good FA in 2022, it's no good FA every single year. The Rockets don't want like a middling pick, they want a lotto pick. You need to be really bad to be in that range. Also keep in mind there will undoubtedly be teams outright tanking to get lotto picks."
"Gordon is a more athletic defender. He has low bball IQ and isn‚Äôt great at defending a PnR which means he‚Äôs going to get abused if he spends minutes at the 5. It‚Äôll be kanter all over again where Dragic and Bam just do it to us over and over again along with other good pairings.  He also can‚Äôt shoot 3s and doesn‚Äôt do much off ball. Not really someone we want to bring in. Orlando didn‚Äôt make AG bad, AG makes Orlando bad. He has some good passing skills but as Jayson and jaylen advance dramatically at their playmaking skills, that‚Äôs becoming less and less needed.  Jerami Grant is raising his value so fucking high that the TPE isn‚Äôt going to get it done unless he crashes back down to earth at some point.  I‚Äôd really rather not take TRoss because he can be streaky but I‚Äôd take him over AG. Barnes is the best bet between the three. But, I‚Äôm actually in favor of not using it until summer. Keep the Jays as the primary focus and give them the taste of being the #1 and #2 options on a team, then introduce another element once the hierarchy is FIRMLY established. They also need to be put into the fire of the playoffs as the main guys again. We need to see them overcome their failings of blowing games last season.  I say we hang onto it, evaluate at the end of the season exactly what we need and either go for someone or break it up and acquire some good role players."
"That‚Äôs not entirely true. Some guys can both be efficient and be a drag on the offense when dominating the ball. Lavine has certainly taken a step up, but guys like Trae, Booker, Lavine, etc. essentially dominate the offense by dribbling the ball often causing teammates to phase out and they basically determine how good the offense is. If they‚Äôre hitting all of their shots they look like top players but on nights where they shooting below average they can do a lot more damage than good.   Kyrie I think is a tier above those guys but look what happened in Boston. He looked like a top PG but in the playoffs he spent the series dribbling the air out of the ball and freezing out teammates. The next year they replaced him with Kemba who wasn‚Äôt as good but also didn‚Äôt dominate the ball as much and allowed Tatum/Brown to be more involved in the offense and breakout.  We‚Äôre seeing it right now with Jerami Grant. He‚Äôs definitely proving himself that he can score the ball, but at same time if Jerami Grant is your primary scoring option you‚Äôll probably be one of the worst teams in the league. Both can be true, it‚Äôs just Grant‚Äôs role on a contender is ideally a 3rd/4th option playing in the flow of an offense rather than controlling it. Same thing with I think would happen to Kuzma if he was traded to like the Knicks, he‚Äôd probably put up 20 a game but the teams offense would also suck.  Booker CAN put up 27 a game, but he‚Äôs better off taking a step back and taking less shots while having someone like CP3 make the decisions of the offense and getting others involved rather than just trying to constantly run PnR or ISO‚Äôs himself.   It‚Äôs pretty easy for anyone to put up points with how fast the pace of the game and how offensive friendly the game is, requires a bit more watching to see who is actually scoring within the flow of the offense rather than in spite of the offense."
Anyone paying attention wouldn‚Äôt be surprised by this. Jerami grant is a real surprise imo
Jerami Grant and Dort's shooting improvement is suprising too

Jerami Grant music
"So they start the THT segment by mentioning Jerami Grant got 60m, then spent half the segment talking about what a max contract for him would look like. No one is giving him 80m over 4 years, doesn't matter how the deal is structured. He's played 20 games. He's still getting DNP-CDs. Someone might overpay him, but it's ridiculous to be talking about max contracts for him."
"I mean, Jerami Grant and Beasley actually look better after leaving the Nuggets. Jokic elevates his team, but the cast is also solid."
"I need a shirt with Blake Griffin, Derek Rose, Jerami Grant, and Mason Plumlee on it thats says ‚ÄúMy clip is empty.‚Äù"
"I think the Jazz' biggest issue right now is we have no one that can defend athletic guards. We match up terribly with guys like Lillard, Murray, and so on. Royce is a great defender against forwards, but can't stay in front of a guard to save his life. Then you have Mitchell and Conley who both just can't cut it either.   We really need someone like a Gary Harris or Jerami Grant."
Jerami Grant didn‚Äôt win 3 rings and win DPOY and also wasn‚Äôt an integral part of the best regular season of all time. You‚Äôre basically saying fuck Draymond because he played with great players.  What elite role player is dropping 32/10/9 in a game 7 of an NBA Finals while guarding LeBron?
Should Jerami Grant make the Hall of Fame?   Because he's doing a hell of a lot more by himself than Dray did last year leading a garbage team.   He's got a specific skill set that worked on a specific team that happened to have three bona fide Hall of Famers and the two best shooters of all time.   I'm not saying he's bad. He's an elite role player. But that's it.
"I think either Keldon Johnson or DeJounte Murray (so far).  Keldon seems like a for sure 10+ year player. His on-ball defense, his rebounding, his driving, his motor, it‚Äôs all already reeeally good. His 3pt flashes also seem like he can be a consistent 3pt threat too down the line. This is also essentially still his rookie year, as he only started playing in those 8 Bubble games the Spurs had. If he can learn how to create his own shot and draw more fouls, he will be a PROBLEM.  DeJounte Murray seems close but not over the hill of being a fringe All-Star. He‚Äôs good at drives, midrange shooting, on AND off ball defense, rebounding, and assisting. His problem is more his consistency. Some nights he‚Äôs brought it all and looks good, some nights he looks shook and awkward and lost. His motor and instincts need some work, and while he is a capable shooter and driver, it‚Äôs not reliable day in and day out. I believe he‚Äôll get there soon, maybe even later this season.  Lonnie has major potential, but I‚Äôm not the most optimistic of Spurs fans about him. His speed and athleticism are amazing, and the tools to be an elite shooter and scorer in the paint ARE THERE, however, I‚Äôm feeling less confident it‚Äôll all come to fruition. His BBIQ is low and his instincts are bad. So many times he second guesses himself, tries to do too much, and loses confidence in games. Pop always needs a ballhandler on the court with him because he (rightfully) doesn‚Äôt trust Lonnie to do things on his own. And while he‚Äôs still young and can improve on these, there doesn‚Äôt seem to have been any, so I‚Äôm not betting on it.  Devin Vassell looks great so far. He‚Äôs a prototypical long defensive wing with good instincts that can shoot from three. He reminds me a lot of Jerami Grant. He seems like a guarantee future starter in this league. Not much else to say about his ceiling yet since he hasn‚Äôt had that many minutes on the court, but almost all Spurs fans like him so far.  TLDR; Keldon or DeJounte."
"Galaxy-brain take: They're going to continue to suck this year and they'll fade for Cade.  Wing players are the hardest ones to find, so pair Cade with Jerami Grant (a great wing on a good contract) and solve your biggest problem."
But he's averaging 25 ppg. Jerami Grant &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
i mean jerami fuckin grant got a fat stack and is getting the ‚Äúcenterpiece‚Äù treatment in detroit
"Not even close when you have players like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant and Colin Sexton. Maybe even Malik Beasley"
Jerami Grant above Wood
Jerami Grant is a close second imo
"Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Mikal Bridges are more impressive IMO, but Boucher def deserve some cred"
jerami grant and boucher
"It's really not an over pay for someone who can log 15-25 minutes  Also, even if they aren't winning, pretty obvious Jerami Grant was a plus signing  Rest of the roster just generally sucks and I think Blake is broken"
"Mentioned in another thread, going by Eric Gordon's new comments, it feels like we're at the part after a superstar trade where fans and the other teammates convince themselves that trading one of the Top 6 talents in the league is actually *good* for the team.  It's not.  Then the team implodes because the star made the mish-mash group of players work and everything implodes around the franchise.  If I'm the Nets I'm not too concerned about Harden and Durant resigning when their deals are up. I'd be more concerned about Kyrie, and if I'm the Nets, I try to trade him.  If I'm them, I wouldn't expect fair value, just go for depth; a solid G who can play D or hold the fort till Dinwiddie returns, a C that can do the same, and another F that can score a bit, etc.  I also mentioned other day that I thought DET could be a landing spot for Kyrie, and after GM's recent comments, it wouldn't surprise me.  If DET offered Rose (or Svi Mykhailiuk), Jerami Grant, and Mason Plumlee, Nets consider that if they think Kyrie won't fit, no? Does DET have an extra first from another team they can throw in?  That's the kind of depth trade I mean. Get some/any value you can back. And DET, it's a chance at relevancy/maybe a higher ceiling than they currently have. It's going to be hard for them to get that level of star otherwise. Maybe he and Blake work decent or sell some tickets."
Jerami Grant looking tasty right now.
Christian Wood IS average. I don‚Äôt get the hype. Also don‚Äôt get people that said he was better than Covington or Jerami Grant lmao when it‚Äôs just simply wrong.
"No it‚Äôs not, only the starters get a fan vote and now the fan vote is only 50% of the overall selection vote. Ja isn‚Äôt a starter, and coaches pick the reserves.  And let‚Äôs see: Giannis Embiid Beal KD Irving Tatum Jaylen Brown Sabonis Harden Randle Trae  Zach Lavine  Honorable mention: Middleton, Tobias Harris, Vucevic, Jerami Grant, Lowry, Sexton, Siakam, Simmons, Terry Rozier, Gordon Hayward, Brogdon  So right now, I‚Äôd say bam doesn‚Äôt make it"
Imagine the nightmare of having to deal with drummond and blakes deal this season. Stefanski and Pistons did well letting Andre go when they did. That space allowed for someone like Troy Weaver to take the gm position and to sign Jerami Grant
"What the hell, why are Clint Capela and Joe Harris above Jerami Grant"
"I understand why Pistons fans have a chip on their shoulder, cause everyone made fun of them this offseason. Like, Jerami Grant has been legitimately great.  But slow your roll...you got a loooooong way to go for Weaver to be considered ""unbelievable""."
Troy Weaver won‚Äôt get it because the pistons are bad but he‚Äôs been unbelievable given what he inherited:   - Drafted ROTY candidate Saddiq Bey  - Drafted absolute stud Isaiah Stewart   - Signed Jerami Grant to a moderate deal who‚Äôs now taken the leap to All Star level   - Signed Delon Wright who‚Äôs now viewed as an asset  - Signed Mason Plumlee who‚Äôs now viewed as an asset   - Signed Josh Jackson who has been incredible  - Traded an expiring Derrick Rose for a second and Dennis Smith Jr who continues to look better by the game   and none of this is including the drafting of Killian Hayes who we have no idea what he can become
"That‚Äôs the whole point dumbass, we‚Äôre tanking. You said ‚Äúanyone on this sub can do better than Weaver‚Äù while the draft picks Weaver‚Äôs gotten, Stewart and Bey, were some of the biggest steals of the draft. Bey just put up 30 points. Jerami Grant is the MIP favourite and borderline all-star; Plumlee put up a triple-double last night.  Pinning Wood on Weaver is a brain dead move considering Weaver said signing Wood was the priority, he wanted to leave. Brown wouldn‚Äôt have done anything for us, Josh Jackson is much better for us . Every FA player has increased their value exponentially with us, and will prove to be great assets. Plus, we‚Äôre in the race to get Cade next year."
"Yeah, we were all happy getting rid of him for nothing just so we wouldnt pay him.  Of course, that nothing turned into Jerami Grant with the capspace. Amazing trade."
Let's not have a Jerami Grant revenge finals
"Jerami Grant. I thought the contract was bad for the Pistons, but now i think he's good value. The Pistons are fun to watch and play hard, thanks in part to him."
Jerami Grant is an elite defender.
"welp if we knew jerami grant wanted to play in Detroit, we coulda used that $ to re-sign malik. Oh well."
Nnaji‚Äôs a raw Jerami Grant. Sheesh the Nugs got some dawgs for rookies
"They have a serious flaw since losing Jerami Grant, but none of the top teams wanna face them in round one and go to Denver"
I love seeing the Jerami Grant praise and then I get sad wishing he was still in OKC.
Seriously I felt like Jerami Grant had a personal vendetta against us the way he played
"I know people have this running theory of players able to easily average 20+ PPG on trash teams but I would really like to see all these players on trash teams doing so. If you look at the lists its extremely hard to consistently score 20+ in the NBA. Last year Rozier was literally the only dude on that Hornets team popping off and was averaged 18 PPG by the end of the season. He's actually scoring 20 ppg now because the team is BETTER.   Jerami Grant is actually good, its not just stat padding."
"Jerami Grant is putting up good numbers, but really when a team is 7-19 and the other scoring options on the team are/were a 32 y/o Rose, a guy who didn't make it through his rookie contract, 31 y/o Griffin and a journeyman spot-up 3pt shooter, there's obviously going to be a need for someone to take some shots."
"Impactful in what way? Jerami Grant was far more impactful as a wing defender but as a scorer, no one saw him suddenly becoming a 24pt scorer in Detroit.   Kuzma was literally a better scorer by his sophomore year than Jerami ever was until this year.  Replace Jerami with Kuzma on Detroit and I think Kuzma scores 20-25 as well."
Kuzma could likely make a leap like Jerami Grant. He's pretty damn talented and skilled as a scorer.
"It's weird how you're getting downvoted and yet you're absolutely correct.  The Lakers and Clippers are doing fine.  The Nuggets lost Jerami Grant and have a hobbled Murray - of course they'll do worse.  The Rockets, enough said.  The Bucks underwent a significant roster change that they're still adapting to (and you could also argue that their struggles started in the bubble).  The Raptors are adapting to the loss of both Ibaka and Gasol.  The Celtics and Heat have had COVID+Injuries."
"imo, the bigger issue for Denver this regular season compared to last regular season is the loss of Jerami Grant."
and it's not like he can't leave eventually and attempt to pull a Jerami Grant. at least this cements his legacy on a team forever.
"The thing that people don't realize is that most of the bench is new. Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, and Torrey Craig were all rotational players who left in the offseason. Integrating new players, injuries, and trying to get Michael Porter, Jr. to understand the NBA game is why the team is underperforming."
"i‚Äôm curious about this actually. was losing jerami grant that big of a hit? also, if you have the time, could you tell me how jamychal green is looking? i miss him but saw a handful of your games where he was looking good but haven‚Äôt seen enough to know really. i hope he‚Äôs getting more minutes than doc was giving him and i hope he‚Äôs happy in denver!"
"Those preseason expectations were based on Harden hate, Dwight Howard leaving, and people not believing in a team full of shooters with not so great defense in 2016-17.   Meanwhile, while people predicted the Thunder would win around 43-45 games, it was because they expected Russ to go off and carry the team like he did in 2015, and he did. And also they had a better offense on paper before the Ilyasova/Jerami Grant trade."
"I would take the current Pistons with prime LBJ or prime MJ to make the 1 or 2 seed in the east, I would at least think they have a shot.  Those guys are just that good imo. I think the bench would be weak but Delon Wright, Elligton, LeBron, Jerami Grant would have LBJ on the floor with some decent to good 3 point shooters and defenders. Just missing a big really but its not as if the Nets have any bigs of note.  Looking at the roster the big would be Plumlee lol but somehow I am still foolish enough to believe."
"Oh wow, forgot Jerami Grant completely. Good looks bro."
Jerami Grant - 53  Kevin Love - 75  Duncan Robinson - Just outside top 100  Tristan Thompson - Probably not top 200
Well it wasn‚Äôt all in isolation. A lot of it was because Adams never left the paint in drop coverage so Dame and CJ were walking into easy pull up jump shots. When they put Jerami Grant or Noel at 5 the pick and roll defense worked a lot better.
"And what would they have traded Barton for coming off a season ending Injury? His trade value was at an all time low. We would have gotten maybe a pick for him or a equally as bad player. Hindsight is 20/20 but to be honest Barton has been a huge part of this team, it's not as easy as ""ah just trade him"" were a small market team and have a hard time keeping decent players here (see Jerami Grant). I think he could be playing better but there's no way we trade him for a better player unless we throw picks and other players in that we aren't willing to lose. And no I'm not willing to trade Gary and Barton with picks for one player. As things currently stand I'd be surprised if any other FO would be willing to give up more than a Snickers bar for Barton."
The Pistons are straight up fun.   I love watching Jerami Grant continue to grow.
they did lose 20ppg scorer Jerami Grant
Yes because I've actually watched Jerami Grant before lol
You think it's more likely that 26 year old jerami grant signifiantly improved his overall game in 3 months rather than him always being around this good but simply not thriving in the role that denver played him at? Yeah ok
Not quite as bad but 6'8 athletic freak Jerami Grant averaged 4.7 rebounds per 36 last season.
1. Scott Brooks win coach of the year. 2. Jerami Grant lead Pistons to play in game.
Playing above their level against good teams to inspire confidence in their players while still bottoming out enough to fade for Cade. Combine Cade with Jerami Grant in the frontcourt for massive success.
"Garbage team with garbage players such as, *checks notes*, Victor Oladipo, Steven Adams, Andre Robertson (one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA before he died or whatever happened to him), Jerami Grant, Sabonis, Enes Kanter. Adams and Kanter were at their peaks. The rest were obviously not as good as they are now, Sabonis in particular was basically a scrub, but they also improved significantly once leaving WB's shadow, Oladipo immediately so. I'd argue playing with him made them look worse than they actually were because the offense was all about WB, all the time. What he accomplished that season was impressive, but basketball is about winning championships, not dragging people to the first round before promptly getting your ass kicked by a Houston team with the guy you beat for MVP surrounded by a slightly better roster. As for Steve Kerr, yes, I'll give you that one but WB has proven that he's not quite the most coachable fellow in the league. I don't want to take away from that point tho because it was super impressive what WB did. It just wasn't championship-level good. Personally, I didn't think he deserved the MVP that year, Harden did. And since then, triple doubles have become mundane, which kind of takes the shine off what he accomplished because to me, it's clear it's as much a factor of the insane pace of the league nowadays as it is a testament to his greatness (which it still is, don't get me wrong).  As for the efficiency argument, yeah, you're right. It's not the end all be all. However, it is when you have two guys averaging about the same amount of points, lol. Please don't tell me you really believe that Westbrook was ever close to Steph on that front, it will break my heart how far education standards have fallen if I need to explain why a guy who regularly flirts with 50/40/90 is better that a guy who never got past 35% from deep. I think you're too smart for that, nobody who could read my smug, annoying arguments and keep going could be otherwise.  We are literally watching Steph play on an equivalent or worse team than that OKC squad and average numbers equal to the greatest offensive season of all time. He is clearly miles ahead of Westbrook. The only reason it might have been kind of close if you make really charitable arguments and ignore the eye test was when Steph first had trouble playing next to KD. But he finished that season tearing through the Western Conference and the playoffs. Yeah he had a better team. Now he has a much worse team than before and he's playing just as good. Yes, he is in fact dragging a sorry-ass team the same way WB did. Have you seen Dray's numbers this year? Only difference is Steph's doing it on a minutes restriction. Anyways, sorry for yelling."
How did Jerami Grant go from near elite defender last year to now a one way player
The moral of the story is they should simply accept that they are bad at very basic parts of the game and never try to improve? Thats how you end up out of the league. Should‚Äôve told Sabonis and Jerami Grant you‚Äôre not allowed to improve any skills you‚Äôre not already elite at. Just be like NBA legend Jimmer Fredette.
"It wasn‚Äôt just the contract (and he signed so fast we didn‚Äôt really have a chance)- he wanted to play for a a Black coach and a Black front office, in a majority Black city: https://www.google.com/amp/s/theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/%3Famp.  Not kidding, was an actual reason which I respect. Either way he wasn‚Äôt THAT important for us in the regular season last year though ofc it does hurt, but JaMychal Green has been super good in a similar role. We will probably make a trade, also Murray, Barton etc have been awful, Gary has been hurt and the bench is just figuring it out. But we have a top 5 net rating playing the 3rd hardest schedule in the league so far so I expect the record to improve significantly as we start playing more below .500 teams."
"I have to say, given how well Jerami Grant is playing this year, I can't help but feel like Denver being cheap and not trying to top Detroit's offer to him seems like it's contributing a lot to Jokic not being in the MVP race this year. With Grant you have to imagine the Nuggets would be in the top half of the playoff bracket rather than down in the 7th seed."
jerami grant was our collective dad in that game
Jerami Grant also got cooked in the playoffs. His defense was way overrated.
Has Jerami Grant tried being more famous? Smh
This season Nuggets struggled is because of Jerami grant.
Sorry I believe you mean Syracuse University legend Jerami Grant.
Pretty hot take that Jerami Grant won‚Äôt beat Giannis or KD in the fan vote.
"Can we get a mention for jerami grant, averaging 25 points on great efficiency? Yeah the pistons suck but he deserves a mention"
"Oh great... another stat geek who probably hasn‚Äôt attended a single econometrics class in his life is citing a bunch catch-all stats without post estimation test results. Cool.  And RAPTOR WAR, seriously? That thing currently has FVV, Jerami Grant, and John Collins to be above Kevin Durant and Giannis btw. A really solid stat from 538.   And fyi, Booker and Lavine are ranked at exactly same spot ‚Äî 76. So going by RAPTOR WAR, if Zach and Booker were to switch teams, the Suns and the Bulls would still be at the same spot record-wise. So if the currently 15-9 Suns has Zach instead of Booker, would that make Zach an all star?"
"Why did you leave us, Jerami Grant?:("
"Did you just name Jimmy Butler, LaMelo, Trae Young, Bradley Beal, and Jerami Grant when talking about MVP?"
Who knows maybe he has a jerami grant type of take off I remember thinking grant was at best a really good 3 &amp; D but he‚Äôs a #1 now
Jerami grant was killing us all late game i don‚Äôt think it was a bad call to go to him
"It has to be someone beyond just good, in that they elevate the entire team.  I‚Äôm thinking Jimmie Butler, LeBron, Jordan.   Like that doesn‚Äôt happen every year.  Even superstars lose a bit of fire from year to year.  So it has to be a player dominating statistically AND elevating his team in the same year.  See Westbrook for an example of a dominant player statistically for a few years but not really elevating the team (he was the offense out of necessity).    AND the team has to be winning and competing to make a run at the playoffs.    So for me this year -   Greek Freak  Jokic  It‚Äôs scary that I would almost list LaMelo Ball here but.. Trey Young trending right direction   Beal is great but team  Curry dependent on how good the team can be  Davis is a consideration  Jerami Grant is just amazing this year  Doncic needs more wins   Anyway that‚Äôs just random thoughts.  I know I‚Äôm forgetting people but just thinking of players I‚Äôve watched this year and went ‚Äúwow that guy is on the next level and elevating his team‚Äù"
YOU LOST TO JERAMI GRANT LMFAO
"https://theathletic.com/1884838/2020/06/24/anyone-can-spot-lebron-the-making-of-pistons-gm-troy-weaver/?article_source=search&amp;search_query=Troy%20Weaver  This is the article, it details how Weaver recruited Carmelo to Syracuse and then found unrecruited gems for the program like Jerami Grant."
"A lot of Raptor fans being hella defensive over this sorry lol. You made a solid point, Grant is definately more guard oriented and is a more natural scorer than Siakam.    TBH though, the Raptor I'd compare him most to is like OG Anunoby, but like an idealized 3 years older version of him. If OG puts up Jerami Grant numbers in 3 years i'd be stoked"
"He's too small to really bother him most of the time. Jerami Grant is probably the best young LeBron defender in the league at the moment, he did well defending him in the playoffs while on the Nuggets and in the two times the Lakers have played Detroit this season."
"No way man, Jerami Grant was widely considered to be worse/similar to OG"
Would you say Jerami Grant is more similar to Rudy Gay? Maybe Danny Granger?
Grant Wood and Boucher imo. But jerami should be comfortably in 1st with wood injured right now
Yes but I just watched the Thunder take a time out and draw up a game winning three for Lu Dort. The Pistons went to Jerami Grant iso lol. I‚Äôm not sure the teams they‚Äôre playing are very clutch either
Fun Fact: Jerami Grant exclusively wears Retro Jordans
"I love Jerami Grant and he's playing extremely well this season. In my opinion he's the kind of guy that makes a good team even better, maybe as a second option or this on a very good team, but he's proving he can do a job leading a team as well. I'd love to see the Pistons get better around him."
"The premise is that Jerami Grant ‚Äúbet on himself‚Äù by taking a 3 year, $60M deal...?   He‚Äôs a good story but that‚Äôs stretching the logic. When we say players bet on themselves that tends to mean a short-term deal to set up a bigger one."
"Sure, but switch those two around and the Clippers beat the Nuggets fairly easily.    Too many players can defend Kawhi successfully(Jerami Grant and Maxi Kleber both did well on him last year), and he's not capable of forcing switches the way other elite offensive players are. And on defense, he's just nowhere near as impactful as AD."
I watched a lot of Jeremy Lin. I followed his entire career. He's the reason why I got back into the NBA in 2011. He was an inspiration to me when I was going through a rough time. What really fucked him was injuries and situations which forced him to be a role player. He didn't have that aggressiveness to be the star of the team. I truly believe he had the ability to be an all-star if he was in the right situation. We can see that with Jerami Grant right now. The problem is that when that situation arose (Nets) he got career-ending injuries which destroyed his athleticism and confidence. He's washed as fuck right now.
He‚Äôs game kinda reminds of Jerami Grant rn but seems to be a better ball handler and playmaker
I don‚Äôt ever want to see Jerami Grant again
Melo (though he‚Äôs almost done in which case I‚Äôd probably pivot to Jerami Grant or maybe someone non-Syracuse idk honestly)
Jerami Grant is just focused on the big games.. Prepping for the playoffs lol
Hollinger found time to criticize the Pistons signing Liangelo Ball to a training camp deal (when everyone knew it wasn't a big deal at all) on multiple platforms. Still hasn't found time to mention Jerami Grant.
"Tough call, Kyrie/Jerami Grant/Dame.   Can‚Äôt help but to focus on them regardless of who else is on a court."
"Right now, I think the ratio is about 1 all star to every 5 players in the dataset, so that would be an improvement.  If I filter further, I will definitely post more results.  &amp;#x200B;  I also thought about that, and if you check out my team vs the top 20 scorers, it's not really close. Notable top PPG guys who aren't in my all star list: Zach LaVine, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Jerami Grant, CJ McCollum, Kyrie Irving. It selected a lot of people who are really valuable under advanced statistics but don't put up huge numbers instead."
Hollinger was the worst. He immediately attacked Weaver as an executive this off-season and I literally have not heard him mention Jerami Grant since Game 1 of the season.
A+ tanking season so far. Jerami Grant is already 26 tho so I feel the Pistons still have a long way to go. Great start at least
No thay is Jerami Grant trophy

"Do you think tanking teams don‚Äôt do this? Derrick Fisher got blasted for winning a bunch of games at the end of the 2015 season. Gilbert Arenas explained when he was a sophomore on the Warriors they would sub him out when he plays too good because they wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay him. Gilbert circumvented that in his Gilbert Arenas way and said if they kept doing that he was gonna shoot every time he touched the ball. Miles Plummer was signed to give Hayes a pick and roll partner and still be bad enough, combine with Blake breaking down and there you go. Can‚Äôt win when your pf is broken physically, and your center can only play basketball the way he is taught and he has the touch of Andre Drummond and fluidity of a baby gazelle. Jerami Grant playing like same age Paul George while super amazing isn‚Äôt gonna do shit. Not when you need HOF verticality badge Roy Hibbert to win games. If they had a legit center (not Andre he would try to be like Jokic and look as coordinated as Plumlee yuck. (But if he played like Deandre Jordan then but I don‚Äôt think he can mentally right now) Pistons got the Lakers because outside of LeBron there isn‚Äôt the post scoring needed when a team like the Pistons has so many solid or good wing defenders."
I like y‚Äôall except I don‚Äôt agree with Fade for Cade. I actually want y‚Äôall to Deflates for Bates because he‚Äôs ur hometown hero and Adam Silver will def pull a Patrick Ewing and rig the first round pick in your favor.  But yeah what u need Bates for if you have Jerami Grant
I‚Äôll have nightmares of Josh Jackson and Jerami Grant for a long time
Why is it so hard to understand lmao.   Lets ignore like 10 other reasons Grant's move was smart for him - just look at the very basics.  1) First options get paid the most.  2) Jerami Grant has a much higher chance of proving he can be a viable first option on the Pistons than the Nuggets.  3) Grant man gets paid
"yeah because team's can't make mistakes. Face it, the team that played gary harris and will barton more than Jerami Grant fucked up."
"If they can make the play-in game, they are going to be a very tough out! A lot of guys with chips on their shoulders, and Jerami Grant stepping up big time."
Jerami Grant did.
Did anyone realize Jerami Grant was capable of this?  Like seriously?
I need to see All-Star Jerami Grant y‚Äôall
Is Beal really going to get them past the teams with the monster wings and centers Clippers/Lakers etc. Beal is going to get picked on in the playoffs by good teams. Ironically what they need is a 3 and D guy who they just lost in Jerami Grant and serviceable defensive center.
"Exactly I don‚Äôt get how people can‚Äôt seem to grasp this idea lol. Their biggest FA signing of the decade is Millsap.   Jerami Grant chose a horrid pistons team over them.   No matter how talented or promising they are, superstars won‚Äôt go there, they only go to Cali, Miami, NY or to play with their boys wherever they may be. There are a few exceptions but Harden certainly isn‚Äôt one."
Jerami Grant is the best defender in the league and I am definitely not biased at all
"And those types of systems work really well with a cast of veterans, but young guys don't develop well. Look at how Jerami Grant, Domas, Victor Oladipo, etc blossomed after leaving the thunder. And we can do this case study with any high usage, ball dominant star, this usually happens. It's not russ slander, but he's an awful fit for this team imo. I would much rather have a veteran PG like D Rose because young talent can still flourish, and that's what the Wiz need"
"Obviously this doesn‚Äôt mean that Conley is the 2nd best player in the league, and doesn‚Äôt mean that Harrison Barnes or Jerami Grant are suddenly top 15 players, but I think this can still be a pretty good way of seeing who‚Äôs been impactful for their team - a way of classifying who‚Äôs truly most valuable maybe, going by the actual definition of valuable."
"There's going to be guys left out no matter many spots there are. Also, its the All Star game, not the breakout star game, people want to see the superstars in the game, not the Jerami Grant and Tobias Harris' of the world, no offense to them."
"Got Jerami Grant, drafted pretty well in Saddiq Bey, Stewart and maybe Hayes. Not re-signing Wood was bad, but they could have done much worse"
"What the heck happened to Jerami Grant, averages less than 10 ppg for his first six seasons and then goes off to average 23.6 this season"
"Lol calm down guys, I forgot to add ‚Äúnow‚Äù. I am a big Blake griffin fan as well (can show you the 2 shirts and 1 jersey I bought of his) but I feel he‚Äôs pretty average now, sharing the spotlight with Jerami Grant. He has surely moved more to a perimeter game than the paint beast he once was but he sure has lost a lot of dominance he once had in league. My point being, he will still sells seats in arena and earn nba good amount of money for what he was once capable of."
Tatum? Jerami Grant? Julius Randle? Zion? Siakam?
yes the foul last night on jerami grant for his last two free throws was egregious

I think he's debating whether to have Jerami Grant or Killian Hayes for dinner
"To remind everyone of his Lakers drafting wins when rebuilding:  2016: Brandon Ingram (2) + Ivica Zubac (32)  2015: D'Angelo Russell (2) + Larry Nance Jr. (27)  2014: Julius Randle (7) + Jordan Clarkson (46)  Obviously, top picks should yield good/great players, pending development, but he drafted three (currently one-time) all-stars, avoiding relative busts like Jahlil Okafor (2015), the minefield known as the 2016 draft (lottery had great players like Simmons/Ingram/Brown/Murray/Sabonis mixed in with picks ranging from pedestrian to disastrous like Bender/Chriss/Maker/Papagiannis), and picked the best available player in the 2014 draft after Wiggins/Embiid came off the board. Obviously, LaVine and Jokic were picked later in the 2014 draft, but Jokic was passed on 40 times for a reason.  And his late first- &amp; second-round selections were stellar, relatively speaking. Clarkson was by far the best remaining player at the 46th pick, with the only notable players picked near him being Dwight Powell (45), Jokic (41), Jerami Grant (39), and Dinwiddie (38). The end of the 2015 NBA draft was a stash/reach fest, with only 7 of the last 22 picks seeing even one NBA game (including Norman Powell at 46). Outside of Montrezl Harrell and Powell, the 2015 draft was really bad after the lottery (and not even that good in the lottery). 2015 may be one of the worst draft years ever. In 2016, the really only quality player picked after Zubac was Brogdon at 36, who was really unfairly maligned for being a 4-year college player and for being a relatively unathletic point guard."
Last year Jerami Grant was in this group.
"**3 Months Later:**  Danny Ainge on @Toucherandrich talking about old report that Celtics had offered multiple 1st-rounders for Jerami Grant: ""It wasn't true but Detroit may have thought it was true."""
It‚Äôs true I‚Äôm Jerami Grant
"Jokic and Embiid are competing for MVP, Jerami Grant is averaging like 24 somehow, the jazz has the best record in the league because of incredible defense and three point shooting, curry is trying to carry the warriors to a playoff spot, James harden was traded to the nets and is averaging a near triple double, and uh somehow the knicks might make the playoffs with one the worst offenses in the league"
yo i traded zion and lauri for jerami grant and the porzingod earlier in the year in my fantasy league . i‚Äôm pretty happy
"Joel Embiid has a 78% efg, which doesn‚Äôt account for free throws, where I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs like a 90% shooter in the clutch for his career.  Obviously Dame is the most clutch player in the league, one of the most clutch ever. But not damn if Joel ain‚Äôt 2nd or 3rd idk who is.  Edit: also props to Jerami Grant for being there, would‚Äôve never thought that when he came in."
Nikola Jokic 29.5 .... age 26 Devin Booker 29.4 ....age 24 Jerami Grant 19.0 .....age 26 Zion Williamson 10.2 ....age 20 Ja Morant 9.1 ....age 21   98.2M  and with no one over the age 26 we building for the future!!
Next you‚Äôre gonna start telling me about Sabonis or Jerami Grant
Besides Jerami Grant who else on the Pistons thats worth a damn?
"I wonder what the average improvements of stats are on the MIP winner per year  Julius Randle is at +3.7 points +1.4 rebounds and +2.4 assists.  Jerami Grant is at +11.4 points, +1.8 rebounds and +1.7 assists.  To me, MIP is the least of all the awards to have team record weighed in."
He got them Jerami Grant and the Pistons actually get to keep their draft pick at the end of the season
"Jerami Grant I guess, I don't really hate any particular team but dislike the Pistons, so there."
"Really though? Here are some people on ~20m contracts. Jerami Grant, THJ, Terry Rozier, Eric Gordon, Bojan, Caris LeVert, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Gallanari, etc. Given a choice, would you willingly pay 20M for Wiggins over any of these players?"
"It's also the cap equivalent of FVV, Brogdon, and Jerami Grant. See how easy this is? Barnes is setting a career high in TS by 5%. Is this who he is? Or is it possible it's just a 33 game sample where he's hitting his jump shot at way above career norms. It's also not about picking someone in the 20s to become Barnes, although in recent years you could end up with very good players in the 20s or later, who provide significant surplus value on their rookie deal. It's about having the assets and flexibility to improve instead of locking yourself into an average starter for 20 million. There's no surplus value in Barnes. The opportunities this offseason (or any) with 30+ million in cap and two extra first round picks is way better than Barnes at 2/40. Not only that, but if it helps them tank this year they could improve their odds at someone like Mobley."
Did Jerami Grant even improve at all? He just double his shot attempts because he was the only NBA caliber player on the Pistons. Wouldn't say he improved much as a player.
"If we end up trading our picks for a player, I want turner or a scoring wing like jerami grant.  Unfortunately I have no idea how we would match the salaries in that trade"
"Yeah. That‚Äôs why you have to TRUST THE PROCESS. If it were easy, anyone could do it. It takes toughness and discipline to bear the critics and stick to the plan.   Or you can hire a Colangelo to come in and panic trade two 2nds for half a season of Ish Smith, sign Jerryd Bayless to a 3year deal, and trade a young &amp; promising Jerami Grant for nothing. Only good moves he made were a couple 1-year overpay deals for JJ and grabbing Ersan and Marco as buyout guys. He gets no credit for the Simmons pick."
"I‚Äôm curious to see what we do with our draft picks this year. We could package them for a vet with scoring abilities like jerami grant, maybe a better rim protector like Myles turner.   We could also double up on shooters/playmakers in the draft. Davion Mitchell at 7 and Jalen Johnson/Zaire Williams at 17 would be a sweet first round."
"Were the Sixers tanking when they drafted Joel Embiid instead of a healthy player who could contribute like Dante Exum? Were they tanking when they traded away future superstar Michael Carter Williams for a first round pick? Were they tanking when they took a future first and Dario Saric who wouldn't come over for two years in exchange for Elfrid Payton? And were they tanking when they gave minutes to g leaguers like Robert Covington or second round picks like Jerami Grant?  Or is it possible young players just need time to develop or get healthy? Is it possible Michael Carter Williams or Evan Turner weren't going to result in the Sixers winning more games? And is it possible after the Sixers traded away essentially everything valuable they had for a player who would never play a single game for them, it was not feasible to put together a competitive team immediately?   Who's to say? I don't know but I don't think it's you. You're not the Sixers expert you pretend to be  Edit: Also what is this?  &gt;Just going through the replies you will see many readers were misinformed by the false narrative you pushed  Did a child write this?"
"I think the biggest thing with the Sixers is that they handed over the reins to a bunch of guys to play huge minutes and lead their offense, who were not only unqualified to do so, but what‚Äôs worse is that they had no intentions of having those guys as future pieces of the franchise. Look at the dozens of guys who littered through the Process Sixers.  But this year I think the Thunder did well to give a lot of opportunities to guys they actually envision as part of their future. Or at a minimum they found out of guys deserve more time. Guys like Maleson, Bazley, etc. earned/were gifted huge minutes this year because of OKC‚Äôs situation. I think both of those guys will be on the team in 2-3 years.   ***  In contrast you have the **2013-14 Sixers** - their top 5 minutes leaders were:    - Thad Young (not with PHI following year)   - MCW (in season trade following year)   - James Anderson (not with PHI following year)   - Evan Turner (traded mid season that year)   - Tony Wroten (played 38 more games for PHI after 2014 season)  **2014-15 Sixers**  Top 5 minutes leaders    - Nerlens (played 1.5 seasons with PHI after 2014-15)   - RoCo (finally someone they developed and held onto long term)    - Mbah a Moute (gone at end of season - why did they play a 28 year old vet 29 mpg to score &lt; 10 PPG on &lt; 40% FG)   - Hollis Thompson (played 1.5 seasons with PHI after 2014-15, but this is exactly the type of young player they should‚Äôve been playing, not known value vets like Luc)   - Henry Sims (gone at end of season)  **2015-16 Sixers**  Top 5 Minutes leaders    - Hollis Thompson (lead team in minutes, but then only played 31 games for them the next year)   - Jerami Grant (played 2 games for PHI following year)   - Isaiah Canaan (didn‚Äôt play with PHI following season - but even though he wasn‚Äôt in their future plans they had no problem letting him score 11 PPG on 36% FG)   - Nerlens    - RoCo  ***  Obviously, you never know what‚Äôs gonna happen, but this year the following were the top 5 minute-getters for OKC:   - Maledon (OKC acquired him in Horford deal and promptly signed him to a 3 year deal with a 4th year team option - ie they invested in his future)   - Bazley (used first round pick on him)   - Dort (signed through 2022-23 with OKC)   - Kenrich Williams (acquired via S&amp;T, signed through 2022-23)   - Isaiah Roby  With SGA and Poku rounding out the top 7.  Did sitting Horford make them less competitive? Of course. But let‚Äôs say, even if they didn‚Äôt have their own draft pick, sitting Horford still would‚Äôve been the correct decision because realistically he is not a part of their future."
"Yeah that part is bullshit. Covington, TJ McConnell, and Jerami Grant probably aren‚Äôt even in the league still if they didn‚Äôt get all the minutes they did on the Sixers Process teams."
Yeah that‚Äôs completely ridiculous. They gave chances to a lot of guys who never would have gotten them otherwise and they found a lot of diamonds in the rough.  RoCo is the easiest example but JaKarr Sampson and Jerami Grant are others. And you could argue TJ and Dario as well as others.   A big part of the process was taking flyers on people who had potential but currently weren‚Äôt good and seeing how they developed. It was the best part of it IMO.  I still wonder if KJ McDaniels could have been good if his mom wasn‚Äôt such a bitch.  Oh what could have been.
"Plan A longshots: Harden, Giannis, Embiid, etc.   Plan B stars: Beal, Paul George, etc  Plan C pseudo-stars: Hayward, Lonzo, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Myles Turner, etc."
"Bro we were literally able to get Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris from moves he made two years prior. He literally said he shuddered at the lost opportunity of signing Robert Covington as an UDFA when Houston picked him up. He didn't just suck and guess, he was building something that stood the test of time (BC and EB). Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel, Richard Holmes, TJ McConnell to name a few pieces that would be really beneficial to contenders not as stars but as high-mid level bench pieces"
"Jerami Grant from Detroit. Obviously you would have to tweak the trade on both ends (possibly send Wiseman to a 3rd team if Pistons don't want him) but that would be an ideal piece to round out their lineup imo  Edit: looking at the payroll its actually hard to work out salaries for a good trade lmao, Warriors have some crazy contracts"
"Outside of sitting Horford is a pretty big disclaimer, man.   And those G-Leaguers turned into guys like TJ, Jerami Grant and Covington.   And you think you‚Äôre not doing the same thing the next two years? It would be stupid for Presti not to given his picks."
"This argument gets repeated ad nauseum and it makes little sense. Just because you're valuable to your team does NOT mean you're the MVP of the league.  Jerami Grant is the MVP of the Pistons. Should he be in the consideration? What about Cristian Wood of the Rockets? What about LeBron and the Lakers? They were dog shit without him. **Unless you are the MVP of your team AND your team is winning enough games, you cannot be the MVP of the league **"
Yeah it's actually astounding how much better our defense is when he isn't playing. I think some of that is due to LaMarcus but he only played like 20 games for us this year. DeMar is absolutely awful at navigating screens. We could've seriously used someone like Jerami Grant but there's nobody like him on the market this year.
"This isn't necessarily about this game, but about this ""Lebron gets all the calls"" narrative. Lebron is one of, if not the, most powerful athletes we have seen in this game. He consistently attacks the rim and battles through a ton of contact on a nightly basis. With this power, athleticism and playing style, you would assume he'd be among the league leaders in foul shots per game, right? Wrong. This season Lebron is 23rd in free throw attempts per game with 5.7 attempts. Embiid is shooting 10.7 per game. Lebron is behind Trae, DeMar, fox, sexton, jerami grant, ja, dbook, etc. Last year he was 19th and shot the same amount 5.7 per game. Spencer dinwiddie shot 7 per game. Harden shot 11.8 per game. This has generally been the case his whole career.   Can anyone defend this narrative with actual numbers? Is there anyone making this claim who wants to have an honest discussion?"
jerami grant looks like M Night Shamylan
"Jerami Grant, Serge, Thanasis, Dame, Gordon Hayward"
Jerami Grant already showed what he was in the playoffs last year. Allen might be only 23 but he's on his next contract. That's the point where you either have to show you're a star or a role player. He might become a star but the Cavs shouldn't take this bet in my opinion. They should trade him for picks.
"You also have to consider that Allen is only 23 and still has a lot of room to grow. The Cavs don't have an infinite number of picks like the Thunder, so they can't afford to lose Allen unless Mobley falls into their laps. Sometimes small market teams have to gamble on a guy and hope for the best. Jerami Grant is working out well for the Pistons so far."
Jerami Grant only played in 54 games while Julius Randle played 71 games. I think availability should definitely be considered for MIP and other awards.
"Last season Randle was a pretty bad player with a lot of opportunity, now Randle is All NBA.  Last year Jerami Grant was a solid player with limited opportunity, this year he is an above average player on a bad team. Not anything crazy, just meh. Bad efficiency, overall just not an amazing offensive player, but a good defender nonetheless.  Stop trying to make an argument here, spend your time on COTY or something."
"I appreciate the hard work on this but the key to me is: Jerami Grant is playing a vastly different role this year. He‚Äôs gone from a glue guy to a go-to scorer (on a bad team), so obviously his raw stats are going to take a big jump."
Beal should get treated like Jerami Grant. Of course he averaging thirty on this BUM ASS team. Somebody gotta score right
"Randle had decent numbers before but he took a massive leap in playmaking, defense, rebound numbers are higher. It‚Äôs not just his scoring that went up  And yes I‚Äôm just bias but the only one closest to him in terms of improving all around is Jerami Grant"
"Pistons didn't start tanking until they saw OKC, ORL, CLE, HOU blatantly tanking into a nosedive and trying to steal their spot.  That's when the Pistons wised up and started sitting Jerami Grant and other veterans."
"What kind of a player do you want in CJ's place? I think you'd have a ton of offers for CJ if you did try to trade him. Looking for a better forward, maybe someone like Jerami Grant?"
"TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Dario Saric. Those were process guys, not first round picks, but second rounders/undrafted/gleague players/eurostash never coming over players. And they're each putting in work somewhere and earning good minutes. The only reason Silver intervened was because we weren't a small market, we were a big market and we blew up an 8 seed roster which had failure after failure and no obvious way forward to contention, it took us 5 years to go from mediocre to 1 seed. I'd fucking do it again in a heartbeat if we ever got back to that 8-10 seed mediocrity."
"The 2015 Sixer who won 10 games included solid NBA players who without the Process to give them a chance may never have gotten a chance to develop into the players they are now.  This includes TJ McConnell, Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, and Richaun Holmes all of whom are solid role players still even though none of them are stars."
You don't get to be an NBA player without supreme belief in yourself. He also saw what Jerami Grant did and how it paid off.  But ultimately he's showed that he doesn't have the skills to be the primary playmaker and ball handler on a top seed. He should just be happy to get paid and play with LeBron.
"I think Jerami Grant is just as - if not more deserving. IMO, Randle hasn't improved by leaps and bounds. Is he better than he was last year, of course. But he went from ~20ppg to 24, he was a starter both years, and the team has gotten better around him. He did make big strides with his 3p shot this year and I'll give him credit for that. However Jerami went from 3rd - 4th option to 1st and saw his ppg go from 12 to 22. He doubled his assists, his usage, and saw a big uptick in his minutes and role. Randle definitely improved but I don't think he improved the *most* from where he was last year."
MPJ saved Denver and that's why they were able to get rid of jerami grant and survive Jamal's injury. Next durant maybe
&gt; Jerami Grant has shown he can be a No. 1 on a lottery team.  Lmao this is backhanded as fuck
LaMelo and Bridges have 12 alley-oop connections. This is surprisingly low to me. Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee have more (15)! Guess it's quality over quantity for them!
That ending was fuckin crazy and whoever took and blew that layup at the end (jerami grant maybe?) got lucky as fuck cause they‚Äôd be an all time lowercase goat
For the pistons I would go curry   I feel like a curry isiah Stewart pick and roll would be nice and jerami grant as the second option would be cool
Case in point Jerami Grant is definitely overrated. He fulfills eye test requirements but his advanced stats aren't that good.
How about LeBron shooting fewer FTs in the first 3 games than Jerami Grant shot in one of those games ? Game 3 IIRC
"I needed the Heat to win so badly tonight. I hate the fucking Pistons. In fact they're my least favorite team in the NBA right now and it's not even close.  Fuck Bey and his trashtalking ass. Shut the fuck Up and go accomplish something first.  Fuck the Pistons. Fuck Troy Weaver. It's not adorable to be utter shit for one year by choice. It's pathetic.  Most of all FUCK THE MEDIA for all the attention they spend on these loosers despite them not even trying to win fucking games.  Fuck the Media for celebrating every tweet of Jahlil ""I punched a boston fan in the face"" Okafor. I was so happy when I saw Jalen Rose told that punk to shut his mouth and act like a professional.  But most of all Fuck them for crowning their asses before they've done anything. At this point ""Beywatch"" (what a stupid nickname) is the wet dream of half the NBA writers across the League. Jerami Grant is Jerian Grant 2.0 and Okafor is basically Shaq with a 3 point shot.  Fuck the Pistons, Fuck Okafor, Troy Weaver, Fuck the Pistons. Also FTP.  EDIT: LOL I see a lot of Pistons fans coming over here acting like fucking childs. Let me just say this:  I have more respect for the 2008 Detroit Lions than for the 2020/21 Pistons the Lions at least tried to win a game."
You‚Äôre exaggerating heavily if you think Jerami Grant proved himself as a number one option. It‚Äôs not super clear that Killian Hayes will be a big-time contributor either.
"Tbh randle was already averaging 21 ppg, I would say that a guy like Christian wood or jerami grant deserves mip more"
Jerami Grant will never be a #1 option on a good team
Jerami Grant is a legit number 1 option if you're looking to tank
Pretty easy to play when Detroit rests Jerami Grant five nights in seven days for the second half of the season.   But legit Saddiq I‚Äôm very high on. They had a great draft.
He had the season people thought Jerami Grant was going to have. Shoutout to both of those brothers tho man
"We owed a first round pick thanks to the Bynum trade the year before. Hinkie‚Äôs first offseason (2013) we had Jrue, the 11 pick, Thad Young, Evan Turner, Spencer Hawes, Lavoy Allen, Arnett Moultrie. I think that was it.  Hinkie left three years later and we had Embiid, Covington, the rights to Saric, Noel, Okafor, the upcoming first overall pick (Simmons), a Kings pick, TJ McConnell, a Lakers pick, a Kings pick swap, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Isaiah Canaan, a slew of extra second rounders, two more extra 2016 firsts (TLC and Korkmaz), Jakarr Sampson, Nik Stauskas, Ish Smith, Hollis Thompson. This was mostly from memory so I may have missed some stuff."
"ah yes. guys like jerami grant, robert covington, tj mcconnell sure did lose out being in philly"
You forgot Jerami Grant and Richaun Holmes
"He‚Äôs right. I‚Äôd love to see that starting 5 all in their primes though.   Russ, Dipo, Jerami Grant, Sabonis, and Steve Adams."
"Lou will was a late season addition and played like absolute garbage. Young Clint capela, sure. Meanwhile the thunder had jerami grant, oladipo,  and sabonis"
"Starting 5: D'Angelo Russell / Anthony Edwards / Jerami Grant / Christian Wood / Karl-Anthony Towns. That's pretty clear-cut unless you're not sold on Edwards yet, then maybe you go Beasley/Ross/Harris?  Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...?  Man this list got ugly quick."
"Hmm.. actually John Wall + Eric Gordon + Jerami Grant + Christian Wood + KAT is a very solid starting 5 with plenty of athleticism, shooting &amp; versatility. DLo, Terrance Ross, Ant Edwards, Malik Beasley coming off the bench gunning threes.. or Gary Harris and Otto Porter if they're healthy in this scenario  Idk about championship but it'd be a pretty nasty team in the East. Probably 4th seed ahead of Atl and behind Phi/Bkn/Mil"
this is basically asking if the wolves are a Jerami Grant away from contending for a championship and imo that's an easy Nope
"Really don't see that materializing .. mainly bc 1) Beal and Washington are heading towards a 5yr supermax extension in 2022 and neither party wants the trade and 2) if it came to it, GSW would need WAS to accept taking back the Wiggins contract which is negative value. They'd also have to pay Wiseman $10M/season which in the modern NBA is actually a lot of cash for a 5 who isn't appreciably better than the Thomas Bryant/Daniel Gafford rotation they have now.  With the assets Golden State has (assuming the Minn pick conveys) I think acquiring another team's franchise player is a bit optimistic but they could be in play for a high-level starter like Miles Turner , Sabonis or Jerami Grant. Grant in particular would be a great add for them imo"
"He's one of the worst passers in the nba, and i've watched every nuggets game. Last year, I thought Jerami Grant was a bad passer, MPJ is next level bad."

"We‚Äôre in line for a top 5 pick, have a bunch of good young players, and a budding star in Jerami Grant.  We aren‚Äôt supposed to be good right now.   I‚Äôve seen my team win 3 titles in my lifetime, how many have you seen the Suns win.."
We‚Äôre a bunch of kids and Jerami Grant. So.. have at it. Good game Clips. Definitely hope you shit on the Suns now in the playoffs.
Jerami Grant
"&gt;Playstyle wise, Damian Lillard and Trae Young are the most similar players to Stephen Curry  They're similar player in that they're small, (kind of) skinny and happy to pull up from anywhere, but their playstyle as in how often they run what sort of actions on court is very different. Curry famously engages in a lot of off-ball movement where fewer fouls are generally called and even then are less likely to not lead to FTs (pre-bonus), and less PnR/iso where it's the ball-handler that's getting fouled. But when he runs PnR/iso plays, he gets fouled at similar rates to the other guys mentioned.  *This isn't to say refs fail to call lots of fouls committed by defensive players on Curry -- just looking if there are disparities in how often he gets a call when running a PnR/Iso play.*  (Data from this season, just as a sanity check, not as a be all end all. Using the 4 players mentioned above and a few other notable high usage ball-handlers/non-bigs.)  [PnR Ball Handler](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ball-handler/):  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Curry|7.5|11.0| |Dame|12.8|11.9| |Trae|14.3|11.9| |Harden (BKN)|8.4|11.6| |Luka|13.5|10.8| |LeBron|5.3|12.8| |Booker|6.2|10.9|  &amp;#x200B;  [Isolation](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/isolation/):  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Curry|1.6|15.1| |Dame|4.8|13.4| |Trae|2.1|15.5| |Harden (BKN)|8.3|14.9| |Luka|4.9|7.7| |LeBron|4.6|7.9| |Giannis|4.5|15.1| |Booker|3.1|13.7|  Curry doesn't exactly stand-out in terms of how often he gets a foul call. He does stand out in terms of how often he runs an action he's likely to get a shooting foul on.   &amp;#x200B;  Curry does however lead in how many handoff plays he runs -- [let's look at the top-10 guys in terms of handoff possessions](https://go.nba.com/mc0m) and Booker since he's close and appears in tables above:  |player|possessions/game|SFL frequency (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |Murray|3.2|7.2| |Curry|2.9|9.8| |Duncan Robinson|2.8|3.3| |Beal|2.8|9.9| |McDermott|2.4|5.9| |Jaylen Brown|2.3|8.8| |Jerami Grant|2.1|10.9| |Hayward|2.0|9.3| |LaVine|1.9|7.1| |Dame|1.9|8.1| |Booker|1.6|6.7|  Two things to note -- Curry is not low on the list of Shooting Foul frequency. Also, the overall shooting-foul-frequency is lower than on PnR/Iso plays -- defenders know not to foul the 3pt shooter.  This is just a quick, sanity-check look at why Curry probably has a lower baseline of foul calls and FTA than some other players -- running plays with a lower likelihood of a shooting foul more often, not simply getting calls less often on the same kind of plays.  *Again, this isn't to say refs fail to call lots of fouls committed by defensive players on Curry -- just looking if there are disparities in how often he gets a call when running a PnR/Iso play.*"
"This was my favorite side effect of the early process Sixers. They found TJ, Roco, and Jerami Grant among others while scrubbing through the bottom of barrel while they were tanking for picks. Although SGA was pretty much always a highly touted player, I‚Äôm sure Dort won‚Äôt be the last gem they find through this rough period."
"Well idek how many times i've added your opponent to one of my parlays with awful odds (around -300 or worse) only for y'all to fucking win a game y'all have no business winning, and being my only loss on the parlay.  Most recently a week ago or so when Jerami Grant was out and y'all had some G-League level team playing against and beat a Kings squad (while not being a great team themself, still weren't really missing anyone of import).  Never bet on DET or MIN games for any sport. Will always fuck ya over."
"Pistons roster has 2 top ten rookies, another rookie in Killian who looks very promising and a very solid player in Jerami Grant. Not to mention other high potential guys who fly under the radar, Sekou, Frank Jackson, Saben Lee and Hami Diallo. Pistons are in a pretty good start 1 year into the new front office regime."
"Yes!  The credit I will give him: he *did* do a decent job at identifying some value prospects in the doldrums, like Robert Covington and Jerami Grant, and he signed them to good contracts. His trades were good, but partially because he was doing fire-sales of assets and only wanted picks back. What he did when he held Payton hostage for the Magic was good. But there are other aspects of GMing that he was *bad* at, and his legion of starry-eyed devotees who pay respect at his shrine on the regular seem to overlook all these."
"Have we though? Under Brett Brown, we developed RoCo, Dario, TJ McConnell, Landry Shamet, and Jerami Grant into solid role players and Grant is an above average starter. Furkan and Shake are coming along nicely as well. Considering the draft position of all those players that‚Äôs a pretty good development record.   Developing players is a two way street. Jah, Noel, and Wood all struggled here, but Jah was (and is) immature and set in his ways. Wood admitted he needed a wake up call to begin taking his development seriously. Fultz was an anomaly and needed a change of scenery. Otherwise, we‚Äôve had a pretty good record of developing talent imo"
"Nope  The best trade for Simmons is with the wolves if they keep their pick this year.  Rubio + Malik Bradley + the top 3 pick to a rebuild team like Detroit (Jerami Grant + another role player).  Simmons may have been shit this playoffs, but is still too valuable to give up for scraps.  Also KAT is literally the best big man teammate for Simmons."
"Both Bogdanovic‚Äôs, Jerami Grant, Myles Turner"
"I‚Äôm reading what you‚Äôre saying. He ranked second in USG% in the regular season with a TOV% of 12.2. That TOV% is in line with the players surrounding him, so at first glance it seems like he‚Äôs not that turnover prone.   However, his AST% is a mediocre 16.2 which is vastly inferior to everyone else around him. The other guys who are comparable (just skimming) are Zion Williamson, Jordan Clarkson, and Jerami Grant, and they all have slightly lower TOV%.   I mean, it goes without saying that if a player‚Äôs role is to create assists he‚Äôs going to wind up with more turnovers because he‚Äôs handling and passing the ball more frequently. So when Embiid has a similar TOV% and has the second highest USG% in the league, but he‚Äôs not being a facilitator or passing, then he‚Äôs turning it over when he shouldn‚Äôt.   You can use USG%, TOV%, and AST%, or AST/TO ratio; whichever way you slice it he‚Äôs turning the ball over at the same rate as players who *are* making risky passes to create open looks, but he‚Äôs doing so while handling the ball in isolation.   You said it yourself; it‚Äôs been a problem since his rookie year, the media asks him about it every summer, and despite some minor improvements it‚Äôs still holding him back. We don‚Äôt even need to bring stats into it to know that, but I like to because they are reference points that tell me *to what degree* of a problem it is. And based on the stats it‚Äôs a pretty major problem. It‚Äôs probably second to his durability in flaws in his player profile. Good thing he‚Äôs elite at pretty much everything else he‚Äôs asked to do."
Jerami Grant is the real winner here
"Jerami Grant is a realistic option  Wiseman, #6, Wiggins for Grant, Plumlee, Josh Jackson, Sekou  Take it or leave it you wont get a better offer  Grant shits on Wiggins, is on a very cap friendly deal, and just had the best season of his career - confidence is sky high  Plumlee is the perfect center for Golden State - put up 10/9/4 assists in 26 minutes last year and is only paid 8M  Josh Jackson is another cheap wing off the bench, Sekou can be tossed in as well - they can be used to add another player as they only amount to roughly 8M in expiring contracts  Golden State also would save around 4M in this deal as well"
Jerami Grant and Plumlee works out  Grant &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wiggins  Plumlee is a free 8M starting center toss in - whatever Wiseman gives you this year and next Plumlee will match in production
"He was only here for 2.5 years.    All his picks had value and would have been traded for more value if allowed.  Some were.     Draft 1 Noel - consensus #1.    BC held onto him too long.  Mostly due to elective surgery Nerlens got   MCW- traded for future pick, Mikal Bridges.  Again, subsequent GM couldn‚Äôt convert the layup and just take the hometown kid  Draft 2   Embiid - MVP candidate  Dario- half of Butler trade.  Again future GM messed it up.    Also picked up an extra 1st which was later Shamet.  Who also was pissed away by Brand in Tobi deal.   And also selected Jerami grant who in Bryan Colangelo first move was traded for ersan.     Year 3   Okafor - was traded to Boston for the Jaylen brown pick.  Newly installed Advisor Jerry Colangelo cancelled.   Bunch of 2s- one of which was Richaun Holmes who was later given away in a cash dump so we could compete a trade for Mike Muscala  It wasn‚Äôt perfect.    But a lot of the mistakes were bc of subsequent GMs.    Put another way, Embiid, Dario, Grant and Holmes isn‚Äôt a bad haul for 3 drafts.  Plus UD free agents RoCo and TJ.    If he was allowed to complete the Jaylen trade bad if brown didn‚Äôt fuck up Bridges it would be even better.  But those are out of his control."
"He hit on Jerami grant, Holmes. Both in 2nd too.   Dario is decent at 12, especially when that other pick got you shamet."
"This is a more detailed account of his tenure than I can write- https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5w63er/analysis_of_sam_hinkies_tenure_as_unbiased_as/  Hinkie is definitely overrated by some, but saying he only made one good move is also really unfair.  His draft picks don't look great, but he typically went with the consensus BPA.  Sixers had awful lottery luck for years- took them years to get the #1 and the Lakers held onto their own pick for years with their own tanking.  Hinkie also wanted KP over Okafor, for what that's worth.  Hinkie found a ton of diamonds in the rough- RoCo, Jerami Grant, McConnell, Richaun Holmes.  Who knows how much credit he deserves for that, as you'd expect any team with that much roster turnover will stumble upon some gems.  His biggest strength was in his trades.  The Stauskas trade in particular was really strong, but he basically never lost a trade in his time there.  Very similar to how Presti's running the Thunder now, but instead of starting his rebuild with PG &amp; Russ, Hinkie had Jrue Holiday and the corpse of Andrew Bynum.  He wasn't a perfect GM.  He underrated the impact a losing culture would have on his players and their development, and how it would impact the appeal of the team to players in the draft &amp; FA.  We never got to see him go from acquiring assets to consolidating the assets into a contender and making a roster where the players fit together.  I think most Hinkie supporters give him the benefit of the doubt here though since he worked under Daryl Morey."
"There was a short window of losing (which btw the Lakers had a worse record than the sixers during the process years) to gather assets and find a superstar. You have Embiid. And for a culture of losing there sure are plenty of processors in the NBA making meaningful impact on other teams (Saric, Roco, Jerami Grant, etc). Those teams stunk, but they played hard.   And how does the culture follow when no one is left from the process except for Embiid (who works on his game every year and very clearly wants to win) and Simmons (meh). It's a pretty big stretch."
"Of the assets that Hinkie acquired:  Covington, Saric, Jerami Grant, 2018 1st (from MCW trade, Mikal Bridges), 2018 1st (from Elfrid Payton trade, Shamet), 2019 1st (from Nik Stauskas trade)  were in part turned into  Butler (gone)  Harris (who was then given a max deal)  Maxey (who ironically enough the Sixers traded the pick earlier for some euro guy who never panned out and only got it back in the Fultz dump)  Mike Muscala (who helped them get the pick that turned into Maxey by making a game winning shot while he was with OKC)  Also, I think technically the pick the Sixers gained from the Bridges-for-Zhaire Smith trade was in the Tobias Harris trade, and LAC traded it to OKC in the PG13 trade."
"If you could get him for Killian and Jerami Grant and next year‚Äôs first, you‚Äôre telling me you wouldn‚Äôt take it? The Pistons are probably going to get an elite guard in this draft, you could potentially have a young core of Simmons, Green/Suggs, Bey, and Stewart."
"He hit on some other guys that were then immediately traded when colangelo came in, like jerami grant. He also hit on korkmaz, covington, McConnell, and saric"
"Honestly, Morey should leverage his playoff run and team friendly contract and trade him together with the other albatross contract in Harris.  A team of CJ-Simmons-Embiid would be ideal, but if you trade Simmons for CJ, replicating Simmons‚Äô defensive value (even if it‚Äôs a slight downgrade) is the next step. I think Curry-Harris-Picks can get someone like that. Someone like Jerami Grant, I‚Äôd say."
I mean there‚Äôs a bunch of ways to attack this post. But I‚Äôll just say the ‚ÄúBlake hasn‚Äôt dunked in 2 years‚Äù stat included like 1 year and a half where he was injured. The pistons were tanking anyway this year and Blake is obviously not good enough to be a second or third option next to Jerami Grant. He can‚Äôt blow by anyone. Honestly the only real retort that matter is this video I‚Äôll link below of Blake playing injured af in the playoffs for the pistons and getting a standing ovation.  https://youtu.be/pqA1c3BbYSQ
Jerami Grant just had a career year. Simmons regressed into a dleague player. Not happening
Maybe a trade centering around Ben Simmons for Jerami Grant swap. Idk how it will work salary cap wise but I assume if they do that they get rid of Harris but idk who'll take that contract. Maybe OKC lol
Ben Simmons+picks for Jerami Grant and Cory Joseph Ben Simmons for D‚ÄôAngelo Russell
Jerami Grant
If I can get Jerami grant back I‚Äôd be ecstatic
Jerami Grant
"Kawhi Leonard might edge out Donovan, or AD if it's positionless. Jamal Murray and Jerami Grant are solid 2nd team options as well."
Ben Simmons for Jerami Grant. Who says no?
"Kuzma's highest points are as good as Jerami Grant. But he's waaay less consistent.       The problem with Kuzma is it seems like he chooses or is given a new style to play every other game. And then he returns to his volume scoring style and whiffs hard.      Dude just needs to pick a role and stick with it. I think the Lakers have him as a flex right now. Kuzma, we need this done, go fill that hole. Kuzma we need that done, go fill that hole. And when it came down to doing what he was originally doing in his first 2 years, he hadn't done it in so long that he was utter trash.      Jerami is getting the support to thrive, Kuzma is being the support for championship players. They don't really have the same load.      We saw what Kuzma can be if he's given more room to be himself. His first two years showed that. Then, when they got AD, he became a fill in the hole type player. Which reduced his growth as an offensive talent. And from what it seems, reduced his skill as an offensive talent. Now all he knows how to do is defend at an average to above average level, and make meaningful cuts."
&gt; Is there any chance Kuzma is as good as Jerami Grant?  cmon man lol  grant was actually a great 2 way role player in denver
"Okay, i admittedly haven't watched a ton of Kuzma. This reminds me of Jerami Grant wanting a bigger role while completely being a role player.   Is there any chance Kuzma is as good as Jerami Grant? Good enough for people to be like ""damn... maybe he can do this?"""
"Who needs a lane when your 4 other starters can shoot. Jokic loves a guy in the dunker spot, if the defense forgets for half a second, it's an easy two points. Plus Ben is exactly what we need defensively, we missed Jerami Grant so badly this year"
Joe Harris does not have close to the value Jerami Grant does
"I could see a 3 team trade happening. Joe for Jerami Grant, and Pistons trade Joe for a young guy and picks"
yeah jerami grant said on the lowe post that he went to detroit because he wanted a black coach. he lost me as a fan when he said that
"Because it matters to players. Jerami grant, for example, has said a big part of his decision to come to Detroit was that they had a black coach."
"&gt; It‚Äôs kinda crazy a guy scoring 26 PPG in the regular season isn‚Äôt considered a superstar nowadays  You realize Jerami Grant of the Pistons averaged 22.3 ppg which was 23rd best in the league.  Victor Oladipo averaged 21.2 ppg on the Rockets  Nikola Vucevic averaged 23.4 ppg on the Magic, 21st best in the league  EVERY team has to have someone scoring 20 something because someone has to score or else every game would be a 20+ point spread."
Idk if he's top ten but Jerami Grant plays good defense.
Simmons? Thybulle? Maxey? Saric? Vucevic? RoCo? Jerami Grant? Landry Shamet? Shake Milton?
"I know the Simmons vibe is real low but so is CJs. CJ had a great start to the year and looked a lot more valuable. After he came back from injury it was hit or miss. I think we can get more than Ben tbh. Id rather be angling for someone two dimensional in a trade, maybe structured around Siakam or Jerami Grant. I mean seriously - CJ isn‚Äôt the perfect fit in Portland, but you can play him in the 4th quarter and not be ashamed.  I‚Äôd rather hang onto CJ than absorb Simmons contract. CJ aid way closer to his contract value than Simmons."
"Jokic also plays with a real PF and always has, which is really important. It means that if he gets drawn out of the paint he can get blown by and there will be someone to cover him. This is clearly something the Nuggets front office is aware of since they‚Äôve gotten Millsap, Jerami Grant, and Aaron Gordon, all who are real PFs and not just wings playing up."
"The Snyder overreactions are dumb. We have no other players worth putting in, maybe Juwan Morgan wont look worse than Niang, but even then he's not doing shit as a small ball 5.   Jazz need more versatile players like Royce. We have no perimeter defense outside of him. Jrue Holiday, Robert Covington, Jerami Grant, Aaron Gordon, etc all got moved and we couldnt get any of them."
I remember he got a dunk off this last year vs jerami grant  https://youtu.be/mh1bwTrUadk
"TIL that Jerami Grant, Sabonis, Sexton, LavVine, SGA, Isaac, FVV, etc are franchise players."
"If Collin Sexton, Jerami Grant, or Jonathan Isaac were my franchise player, I'd probably stop watching basketball for a few years."
"Pistons have Jerami Grant and an elite group of rookies, they should be in contention within 2 years"
"We have 2 rookies on All-Rookie teams, killian hayes, jerami grant, and Cade Cunningham."
"you don't need an all star at center  If these are the only all stars Team USA can get (I doubt it), you fill out the rest of the roster to build around these guys.   The talent pool is huge for non-all stars.    You can get a guy like Nerlens Noel to be your starting centre or someone more up and coming. Just go in there, space the floor a bit, play defence, rim protect. No need to be the main guy.   bring in a couple of big body centres to literally just play defence against the centre's of the world with post game moves.   The rest of the roster can still be filled with non-all stars and still be over powered.  Imagine Fox coming off the bench for a team like this or FVV.   Or Jerami Grant in the big rotation."
"Pistons gotta be up their. They don't have any clear guy who's worth building around. Jerami Grant has put up decent numbers but he's 26, and I don't see him as anywhere near a first option on a good team"
"Jerami Grant, Killian Hayes"
"OG, Jerami Grant, MPJ, Mikal, Wiggins, Bojan, Joe Harris, Harrison Barnes"
Troy Weaver came from OKC and might be planning the same with Jerami Grant.
"The thing is he isn't really like Ainge who refuses to trade a pick. He actually is willing to trade his picks help the team now. During the Durant then WB he was actually trading his picks example: Dion Waiters, Enes Kanter, Jerami Grant, Melo, Dennis Schroder to name a few. He only transition to ( for the future) GM  after the WB-PG trade.  During the Durant era contrary to them just chocking and bad team creation they were were seriously hit by injuries. In 12-13, Beverly injured WB in the first round: 13-14, Ibaka got hurt during the conference finals (their only answer to Tim Duncan); 14-15, Durant got hurt the whole season; 15-16 was ther only real chance to make it back to the finals but they choked and Durant bounced. I don't think Presti can be blamed for this injuries.  During the WB era, no one really saw them championship contenders.  During PG and WB era- first year was a classic choke job but the second year PG and WB was playing with injuries during the playoffs. PG was an MVP candidate, got his shoulder injured during early March  never really recovered (his shooting avareges shoots way down) and needed surgery right after the playoffs  Personally, I think he can be a championship level GM just really series of unfortunate events and fucking awful coaching hire. Tho looks like the new coach is way better than the previous two (Billy Donovan and Scott Brooks)"
"Portland does this in a heartbeat, 76ers probably hang up the phone.  The issue with getting rid of Ben is you don't have another big wing to guard an opponent's best player.  I think the best way to get rid of CJ is to trade him for two FRPs and then throw those + other assets at either Harrison Barnes or Jerami Grant."
Jerami Grant chose the Pistons over Denver because he wanted to play under a black coach and a black GM.   Diversity matters to a lot of players.
For me Jerami Grant has the vibe all over him.
Gordon Hayward just chose to live in Charlotte this year for 4yr/$120m. Jerami Grant just went to Detroit fro 3yr/$60m.  there's a lot of discussion around the abolition of the draft that could potentially balance itself out so you remove the forcing people to play where they don't want to. new players wouldn't choose being the 10th best player for less money and no minutes on the Lakers if they could make millions more and be the focal point of a team and the main star
"The core of a trade where CJ and draft compensation leaves Portland and Ben Simmons goes to Portland seems to fit perfectly for Portland - Ben fills their need of a wing defender, secondary ball handler, rebounder, guy to run the fast break, and a dude who can keep the ball moving on offense, while being the fifth option. Meanwhile they get to move on from one of their two starting SGs to get an actual wing. Dame/Norm/Ben/RoCo/Nurk is an incredible roster.   I think the Sixers could turn some combination  of CJ, Seth, Danny, picks, and young players (thybulle, maxey, etc) into a SF and/or PG. maybe Marcus Smart for Danny Green and a 1st, that way you have your ball handler and defense.   All you need at that point is a SF in return for CJ or Seth plus picks and/or young guys, and maybe George Hill as filler. Maybe some combination of George Hill, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and 1sts for Jerami Grant? I could see Detroit being interested in Maxey, Milton, and 1sts.   Smart/CJ/Grant/Harris/Embiid with Seth as sixth man looks really solid to me."
"You're probably right. Personally, I'd love to see them flip their contracts and picks to a team ready to rebuild and get some players that complement him. He's so good, he's sped up their timeline.  I doubt they could land Beal, but Bledsoe/Adams/Picks for Brogdon/Turner or Brogdon/Sabonis could be great. I'm sure DET would send Jerami Grant for the right price. Toronto might part with VanVleet or Siakam if Lowry bolts. They might be able to get Harrison Barnes, Sexton, Kemba, or Christian Wood. Lots of options, IMHO, just need to be willing to part with picks."
BC is anti process.  Mfer first move was trading 21 year old Jerami Grant for old as fuck Ersan and then unloaded ersan for two seconds at trade deadline.    The process ended when Hinkie was fired.    They went traditional team building with two unconventional talents in Jo and Ben.    Pissed away assets and only have Furkan and a maxed Tobi to show for all those extra picks.
"Blazers trade Damian Lillard for Jerami Grant and the first overall, then trade the first overall to OKC for SGA and the 6th pick."
"I agree there - hes in the perfect spot and should be a career Warrior. If I'm a team with a star though, I'm thinking Beal level top 20 players, Wiggins/Wiseman/picks doesnt get it done if Draymond and Klay are untouchable. Maybe he's shooting more for the Jerami Grant level guys who are much more attainable"
Play Jerami Grant bruh Popavich
"Definitely sold sky high on Ibaka: managed to move an aging PF on an expiring deal for Oladipo, Ilyasova, and the 11th pick (which became Sabonis). On its own, that's a great deal, and when you account for the fact that they then flipped Ilyasova for Jerami Grant, then Dipo and Sabonis for PG, it's looking pretty damn good."
"Jerami Grant is plenty good enough. His length and athleticism will disrupt any team, but I agree with everything else you said wholeheartedly. They should learn from others teams systems - I‚Äôm afraid there are some egos blocking what you suggest from happening"
"Jerami Grant got 0 minutes in the games that USA lost so I don't know what your point is about the team being better with him when he wasn't even given a chance.  Devin booker was on a 11 hour flight a few hours before the game, and was playing in the finals less than a week ago.   Bam Adebayo played great last game, he was not the reason they lost.  Seems like you just hate every young player seeing that you ignore context and blame the them for every failure of the US team and dismiss KD or Dame's bad playing since they are ""proven"". Quit your bullshit"
Saying he has Kevin Love is like saying Jerami Grant had Blake Griffin (for 20 games before the trade). He played 25 games and absolutely sucked.
"He looked absolutely insane last off-season to me. Turned out he was mostly right. He hit huge on the Jerami Grant contract and drafting Bey &amp; Stewart, despite what he gave up in those deals. Kennard and the 2nds for Bey was great. The future first for Stewart is TBD.  He may have missed on Hayes. Tough to say due him missing most of the season with an injury.  I'm just riding it out. As a fan, there's not a whole lot of influence anyways. If he trades out of the first pick, I'll assume he sees something in another player that I cannot perceive because Weaver simply knows more about basketball than me.  Or, he'd have been wrong and I'll hate him for the rest of my life."
The Pistons should trade Jerami Grant before they make decisions around his prime lmao
Jerami Grant? Idk if hes the best 3rd star but he would help a lot
Jerami Grant
"KD is a bit leaner now but he has always been skinny fat. Like he is not Brandon Ingram or Jerami Grant.   Tatum being only 205lbs seems off, which is why I think KD is still around 230lbs now. That weight is really nothing at 6'10. Jrue can't be 6'3 and 230lbs and Tatum 6'8 205lbs."
Jerami Grant at shooting guard. Love having a laugh on Monday mornings.
"1) Do we have complimentary talent though? Who's a + passer? Dame might be the best passer on the team and he isn't known as an elite passer and his assists come more from his scoring ability than vision like a Kidd, Nash, etc.   Holiday is pretty good, but he literally joined the team like 2 days ago.  We don't have a big...guys like Jerami Grant and McGee are on the team.   We don't have good glue guys   2) If we have so much talent, then it should be on the players not the coach right? You think Pop is actually a net negative?"
"Houston Jerami Grant too. In fact from that I discovered that Harvey named all his kids with H‚Äôs and they all go by J‚Äôs. Houston Jerami Grant, Holdyn Jerian Grant, Harvey Jerai Grant"
"Can‚Äôt blame him. This is the weakest roster in a very long time. Adebayo, Tatum, Holiday, and Jerami grant shouldn‚Äôt be on this team lmao."
Draw up a play to put in Keldon Johnson and Javale McGee 15 minutes more than Jerami Grant
"These are the guys that are getting around 20 million a year. W/o even going into how the good ones aren't easily available, one of these guys + the 4th pick is straight up worse than Simmons. Realistically that 20 million isn't going to get you more than two decent role players, I'd still take Simmons  Nikola Vucevic, C	Chicago Bulls	$24,000,000  Julius Randle, PF	New York Knicks	$21,780,000  Malcolm Brogdon, PG	Indiana Pacers	$21,700,000  Gary Harris, SG	Orlando Magic	$20,482,143  Danilo Gallinari, PF	Atlanta Hawks	$20,475,000  Jerami Grant, SF	Detroit Pistons	$20,002,500  Domantas Sabonis, PF	Indiana Pacers	$19,800,000  Fred VanVleet, SG	Toronto Raptors	$19,675,926  Zach LaVine, SG	Chicago Bulls	$19,500,000  Goran Dragic, PG"
"Jrue has been an all star, Some Guys who could get it are Jerami Grant, P-Will, Lamelo, Shai, Ja, De‚ÄôAaron, and maybe Deni if Beal and Westbrook get traded"
I want to see them get Jerami Grant and Christian Wood somehow. Saw the idea on PistonsPowered. Never thought I'd want the Warriors to compete again lol.
"With all due respect to JaVale McGee, Keldon Johnson, Jrue Holiday (who played well), and even my home team guy Jerami Grant, I wouldn't lose much sleep if I were presented with the opportunity to replace them with healthy versions of Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kawhi Leonard."
"Dame, KD, Middleton, Booker, Holiday, Bam, Draymond, Tatum, Lavine, Jerami Grant. Tell me who isn‚Äôt a starter"
That's the same thought process when I brought up my concerns for the Winslow trade. I thought we could have brought in a guy like Jerami Grant had we not took on Waiters/Dieng. Grant would be an amazing veteran on this team.
Thats why you play Jerami Grant
Can‚Äôt they get like Jerami Grant or someone? Rather have him than Russ
"This is what happens when you have Jerami Grant, Keldon Johnson, Javale McGee, and Bam Adebayo  Their WORST player should be Middleton or Booker."
"Kevin Wayne Durant Houston Jerami Grant Jrue Randall Holiday Edrice Femi Adebayo Draymond Jamal Green  But most interesting, France no. 30: Petr209 Cornelie"
NBA All-Stars?   Devin Booker  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Zach LaVine  JaVale McGee  Jrue Holiday  Bam Adebayo  Khris Middleton  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Draymond Green  Keldon Johnson  There are no better players in USA than these? Only one I even know is Kevin Durant.
did they try Jerami Grant at 5 or not?
All of the ones that included Keldon Johnson lol Jerami Grant didn‚Äôt play.
It could work. Pop has gotta put him and Jerami Grant in to do the dirty work.
Shoulda played Jerami Grant if Tatum was bad and KD was in foul trouble.
Bruh why. We need defence. Cough cough Jerami Grant  Jrue is more than good enough to be this team‚Äôs facilitator
"Pop needs to play Jerami Grant, he's one of the few guys on the roster that will play team ball and play good switchable defense."
"For one, not play Keldon Johnson 9 mins when Jerami Grant hasn‚Äôt played at all"
That‚Äôs what you get when you put Keldon Johnson on the floor and let Jerami Grant rack up a DNP
Yeah freakin Keldon Johnson got minutes over Jerami Grant.
Keldon Johnson and Javale getting minutes over Jerami Grant is just disrespectful
Jerami Grant got a DNP. That‚Äôs the story
This is what happens when Jerami Grant gets a DNP. Let it be known
Why is Keldum Johnson playing over Jerami Grant? Popavich need to chill lmao
**FREE JERAMI GRANT**

He isn't worth that much lol. Jerami Grant is better and gets paid way less
"that 2019 Thunder team was STACKED  How the hell did they lose to Portland it is SO weird. The Blazers 3rd best player was Enes Kanter lmaoooo  Westbrook/George + Prime Adams, Jerami Grant 3 and D, Schroder 6th man  Makes zero sense.  And now Portland has a MUCH more deep roster in 2021 and they got bounced by Nuggets without Murray when in 2019 they beat them with Murray. Jokic was MVP this year but he was already dominating in 2019 playoffs.  Just weird weird unpredictable stuff"
"You're right, my point was dismissive of what you're saying. I agree that Westbrook's play at very least seems to define every team he plays on - however, I don't think we honestly have seen Westbrook on good teams enough to make those conclusions. When OKC was a good team, he made it to the NBA finals with the highest playoff usage rate on the team. Even after Harden left, his team made the WCF and went up 3-1 on the 73-9 warriors. Both of those alone are more ""winning"" than someone like, e.g. Damian Lillard has ever done, despite not being labelled a ""non-winning player"" like Westbrook.  And it is true that Lillard never had a team as good as 2012 OKC, and that's why he gets a pass - but Westbrook's reputation as a ""losing player"" was developed under similar/worse circumstances. His MVP season team had a pre-breakout Jerami Grant as its second best offensive option. Making the playoffs with that team was an outright miracle. The PG seasons were disappointing, but they were never considered real contenders during that time regardless. And when he went to Houston, I wouldn't say that team re-adapted itself to be a ""Westbrook-style"" team - so I don't think he necessarily can't fit into systems, and I don't think we can call him a non-winning player for dragging bad teams to the playoffs since he has in fact been an NBA finals point guard."
Jerami Grant
They might be looping in a 3rd team like Detroit.   Indiana: sends Turner + 13 for Jerami Grant  Detroit: sends Grant for Wiseman + 13  Warriors: send Wiseman + salary filler for Turner
" Ok here‚Äôs your homework you moron, so he‚Äôs in the 50-55 range of best players.   Embiid, Simmons, Beal, harden, Kyrie, KD, Jrue, Giannis, Middleton, Randle, Trae, Bogi, Collins, Tatum, Brown, Butler, Bam, Duncan Robinson, LeVine, Brogdon, Sabonis, LaMelo, Hayward, Rozier, FVV, Siakam, Jerami Grant, Mitchell, Conley, CP3, Ayton, Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jokic, MPJ, Murray, Kawhi, PG, Luka, Dame, CJ, Nurk, RoCo, AD, Lebron, Ja, JJJ, Steph, Klay, Draymond, Derozan, Zion, BI, Lonzo, Fox, KAT,  SGA, Christian Wood."
he‚Äôs great at team development and the players love him. he‚Äôs part of the reason Jerami Grant signed with detroit. and lets be honest the real block you had in the playoffs was not having kawhi leonard.
"Forgive me for forgetting about the perennial Jerami Grant, but you get what I‚Äôm saying. If I were a player who has no chance at NBA accolades I‚Äôd try for 3x3"
"Somehow get him Jimmy Butler and he's 100% staying. Jimmy compliments him perfectly. But realistically, one or more of Simmons, Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner, Noel (continues listing 2 way wings and elite defensive bigs)"
"Yeah, like when  Jerami Grant choice Detroit over Denver"
"Honestly this is the trade to be made that is a win-win scenario.   Jerami Grant immediately makes the Warriors a serious threat, with the scoring and defensive versatility in a death lineup. Works for Pistons because Wiseman with Cunningham has the ceiling to become a very good team."
That's an overpay for Jerami Grant imo since Warriors still have to salary match.
I would trade jerami grant for that package.   I would probably use 7 and then try to trade 14
Jerami Grant üòõ
"There‚Äôs a wide gap between not good and fucking max contract lol. THT is fine, but Jesus dude 4/83 puts him with Jalen Brown, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Issac, Malcom Brogdon, Myles Turner, Fred Vanvleet, Jerami Grant, etc.  *could* he be as good as those guys someday? Sure, why not? Should he be getting paid like those guys with his contract? Hell nah."
Jerami Grant
"Here's 46-50.  **46. Deandre Ayton (Phoenix Suns)**  Deandre Ayton was one of the biggest stories of this years playoffs. He arguably outplayed two superstars in Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokic. After selecting him with the first overall pick in the 2018 draft, Suns faithful have been waiting for him to evolve into a star and it‚Äôs looking like he‚Äôs well on track to do so. He had his coming out party in the postseason, let‚Äôs see if that can carry on over to next season. Phoenix may need it if they wish to produce a similar season to this one.  **47. Jerami Grant (Detroit Pistons)**  Jerami Grant became the first option on an NBA team this year. But did he get better or did his numbers increase due to an increase in shots? I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the latter. Grant established himself as one of the best role players in the game with Oklahoma City and Denver. He bet on himself this year in Detroit, and it looks like it did pay off for him. He‚Äôs averaging a career high in points despite his efficiency taking a hit. Look, he‚Äôs not super-efficient, his numbers don‚Äôt contribute a whole lot in terms of winning, but he‚Äôs fun and it‚Äôs good to see him doing well.  **48. Kyle Lowry (Toronto Raptors)**  Kyle Lowry is still a great point guard. Rumours were swirling through the NBA world throughout the season about a Lowry trade, but the deadline passed and he was still in Toronto. But now he is a free agent and the odds of him returning to the place he has called home for the last decade aren‚Äôt great. Lowry is on the older side, but the contributions he bring to the game are still very real. He shoots the ball well and is a top tier playmaker, exactly what a contender could use. But wherever Lowry ends up, he will always be a Toronto Raptor at heart.   **49. Malcolm Brogdon (Indiana Pacers)**  Malcolm Brogdon is a name you don‚Äôt hear very often. But the former Rookie of the Year is actually a very good NBA point guard who can score at a high level and playmake. His efficiency has taken a dip from when he joined the 50/40/90 club with Milwaukee in 2019, but that could change in a better role. Brogdon will be highly sought after by contenders in this year‚Äôs trade market.  **50. Michael Porter Jr (Denver Nuggets)**  Michael Porter Jr took a big leap forward this season, finishing 3rd in voting for the Most Improved award. Porter stepped up massively late in the regular season and in the playoffs with Jamal Murray out. He averaged 23.5 points on 56% from the field in the remaining 17 regular season games without Murray and then. Michael Porter Jr has elite scoring talents, he can score highly efficiently from anywhere on the court. The only problem is, that‚Äôs it. He can‚Äôt pass the ball at a high level and he‚Äôs a traffic cone on defense. But he is still only 22 so the sky is the limit for this guy. With Jamal Murray set to miss a considerable amount of time next season, Porter is going to be asked to step up in a huge way."
"Schroder/Trezz really looked like the making of 2019 Lou/Trezz who were awesome off the bench for Clippers.   Then Gasol was 3 and D and has the legacy of Lakers Pau to step into.  They seemed like perfect additions but obviously not only Dennis was a good fit. I know everyone hates him now but he was really good in 4/6 playoff games he averaged 20 ppg in 4 games on good shooting splits but then was awful in 2 games and everyone focuses on that.    Keep Schroder but trade Kuzma, THT and picks for Jerami Grant.    Schroder, KCP, Grant, LeBron, AD"
They'd have to offer a lot to get jerami Grant from us
With the way they ended the season I could see them being higher than the 8th seed next year. They just need to put better tools around Westbrook. Getting a guy like Jerami Grant or Harrison Barnes would help them a lot
"I thought he was exactly what I hoped he would be for the Nuggets, though I wish he were a better shooter.  He was notably better than Jerami Grant on D and worse on O (even comparing Grant prior to his 2021 offensive breakout season).  It takes over half a season for most players to get used to Jokic so I didn't expect him to be an overly strong offensive force in 2021 but hopefully he'll find his groove in 2022.  His performance basically didn't change after Murray went down.  The Nuggets tried to get him to do a bit more with post ups, but those didn't go all that well.  He did very well against Lillard on D in Round 1.  The Nuggets problem in 2022 is that they only have Murray, Jokic, and Barton capable of carrying an offense for any length of time.  They need at least one guy to step up since Murray is going to be out most of the season and Barton is often hurt, opted out, and may not return."
Jerami Grant specifically said playing for a black head coach (Dwayne Casey) played a major role in going to Detroit.
We give you Giannis for a month and you give us Jerami Grant for next post-season? You won't need him anyways
"If we do that it'll probably be because we traded RJ, Randle, and IQ for Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee."
"No. Luka Doncic spent a total of 14:22 mins on Kawhi, over 7 games, the third highest on Mavs the last playoffs.  He allowed him to shoot 54.5%. Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith spent more time than Luka on Kawhi. Maxi for 38:26, while allowing 63.2% and Dorian guarding him for 29:48, and allowed 68%.   The year before that, Luka spent 9:17 mins guarding him,  4th highest on the Mavs. He allowed 62%, but for only 8 shots. DFS spent 28:12 on him, and allowed 41.4%. Maxi spent 27:07 and allowed 50%, but on a significantly higher number of 56 shots, the most shots he attempted against, besides Jerami Grant.  For Nuggets, Jerami Grant spent the most time defending him, with 56:13, the most by any player. He also allowed 43.9%, attempting 57 shots.  Jokic guarded him for 8:55, allowing 53%, on 26 shots.  Murray guarded him for 8:55, allowing 56% on 16 shots.   So your point about Luka guarding Kawhi for ""good amount of mins"" isn't even true. And it seems that it was Grant who did the most of the guarding on Kawhi, and doing a good job. Grant would probably be the second best player on Mavs. This has nothing to do with Jokic, it's just that Nuggets had a better team."

"if they could get Myles or Jerami Grant, they should seriously consider it"
Jerami Grant stans.
I wouldn‚Äôt call Jerami Grant terrible.
Right now jerami grant is by far better
"JJJ, Jerami Grant, Brogdon, Turner just to name a few are better than Wiggins and could be had with either the Wiseman pick or a combination of Wiseman/Wiggins/2021 picks. There are many players available if you pay up, I don‚Äôt think your FO wanted to pay up and they dropped the ball by doing that.   Your issue would be tax but even then you‚Äôre sending out Wiggins salary. I think a lot of Warriors fans don‚Äôt realize your current FO is different from the one that made the 72 win team."
He has help his name is Jerami Grant and he scored 35 pts last night
lmao jerami grant as ‚Äúfiller‚Äù
Really wish we had Sengun out there. Our offense is super stagnant without his presence out there. Jerami Grant turned into MJ last night so I can't be too mad. We fought back and have been competitive the past 4-5 games. Some of those are bound to turn into wins soon. I am mad I missed a good bet because Wood couldn't score 2 more points. I swear he had close to 20 at the half and then barely touched the ball until the very very end of the game. Our guards have to do a better job getting him involved consistently.
"they need to draft better and pick up value among free agents. Milwaukee gets a lot of props for Giannis and Middleton. I would say the Timberwolves are not significantly worse than that first year of Middleton/Giannis. The problem is that it is easy to say ""sign the next Brook Lopez and Bobby Portis, draft the next DiVincenzo and Connaughton, trade and long term sign for the next Jrue holiday "" but it is quite difficult to do.  &amp;#x200B;  If I were them I would target Christian Wood as he only has next year on his deal, see what it would take to get Jerami Grant on the team, see what you could get for Rubio. They really need to hit at least two home run signings.  &amp;#x200B;  If they do trade KAT they need to get a mountain of picks back and hit on almost every one of them"

Jerami Grant is a good basketball player
Jerami ‚ÄúKevin Durant‚Äù Grant is my hero
Jerami Grant
Jerami Grant &gt; Jalen &gt; Cade
I believe Jerami Grant wanted to play in Detroit and that helped them move on from Christian Wood
Jerami Grant carrying the Pistons
Jerami Grant was a better defender than PG when PG placed top 3 in DPOY that year
"&gt;  Trade cj and a pick for jerami grant   Why would Detroit do this?  Who the hell takes on an undersized and aging player on a big deal and get rid of a younger defensive minded wing.  All for a measley 1st.  Detroit has plenty of draft capital, they are going to be in the lottery."
"They should trade cj long time ago, Now his value is very low, 30 years old, bad contract undersized sg , mediocre passer, awful defender, mediocre efficiency. Trade cj and a pick for jerami grant or cj and a lot of picks for siakam, cj for wood and eric gordon, maybe detroit or rockets accept this, raptors would likely reject, is tough because cj is not a star and never was and now he is 30, I dont know who gonna trade for him, lowry and conley are better players than him and were traded basically for a average young player, overpaid vet and a protected first, so I think this is cj value"
"Because they wanted to sign Jerami Grant instead, that‚Äôs it"
"We had Chris Paul, AD, and Jrue for years. Eventually most players will leave, so those were bad examples.  Randle signed a 1 year deal there to replace Boogie and we let him walk when we knew we were picking Zion, because they play the same position and neither can effectively play another one. Another bad example.  Christian Wood Barry played with us, and we waived him. Another bad example.  Pelicans could‚Äôve brought Lonzo back if they wanted to, but decided to sign and trade him instead. That was the Pelicans decision, not Lonzo‚Äôs, so another bad example.  We literally extended JV before the season so that doesn‚Äôt even make sense.  Zion has lots of years left, and the Pelicans may want to trade Zion before Zion even wants to be traded with the way things are looking.  BI said he wants to be here and is behaving that way, plus he has multiple years left on his deal.  I could say Philly is a farm team because AI, Barkley, Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, and JJ Redick all left.  Also, Ben Simmons is about to leave.  Also, Joel Ennius will force us way out after you fail  to put enough talent around him and get eliminated early in the playoffs again.  Tobias Harris will probably want out after that too.  Let‚Äôs just play it safe and say Tyrese Maxey will want out after that as well.  How did that post even get this many upvotes? ü§¶"
"I mean the average person shouldn't fuck with any NBA player including the ones that are the sons of NBA players and grew up with money. They're super human athletes and could fuck up a massive majority of the population.   I'm from the DMV. I'm not fucking with a soul from there whether it's KD, Michael Beasley, Quinn Cook, Dipo, Fultz, Jerami Grant, Jeff Green, etc. Just cause they not from a country that's got it tougher don't mean they ain't with the shit"

Not that I know of. This one isn't as good: jerami grant has the same eyes as [an actor from limmy's show](https://www.google.com/search?q=alan+mchugh&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiWjqbm64z0AhWMCFkFHSBiD5QQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=alan+mchugh&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYOgcIIxDvAxAnOgQIABBDOggIABCxAxCDAToICAAQgAQQsQM6BwgAELEDEEM6CggAELEDEIMBEEM6CwgAEIAEELEDEIMBOgQIABADULoHWN0YYJgaaABwAHgAgAFdiAHgBpIBAjEzmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=_DqLYZagB4yR5NoPoMS9oAk&amp;bih=977&amp;biw=1880#imgrc=phNYsVzsu5kY1M)
Probably not since he‚Äôs on a 3 year deal I believe  I think jerami grant will get traded this year tho so maybe you can match salary to get him
"I read one idea saying young guys and salary to Detroit, Jerami Grant and Smart to Sixers, Simmons to Boston. But Smart and Grant are an odd fit in Philly. Not sure that moves the needle for them. I think something similar could potentially work. I just don‚Äôt see how Sixers get a star for Simmons at this point unless they include Maxey and multiple picks."
"&gt; Coby is just straight up better than Ross,  Bias talking   &gt; Coby won‚Äôt be our 9th man though, I feel like you‚Äôre underrating his value to this team as a scoring punch off the bench  Lonzo, Lavine, Demar, Vuc, Bradley, Caruso, DJJ, Green. That‚Äôs 8 players I‚Äôm more confident in.  &gt; he‚Äôs literally the only shot creator we have besides Zach and Demar.  And I‚Äôm saying he‚Äôs never proven himself to be a good shot creator, and you‚Äôre already all-in, you should leave your 2-3 allstar team i n the hands of a guy that hasn‚Äôt proven he can even score at a league average efficiency.  If I told you a random team that was 7-3 and a contender is relying on a 21 year old whose best year is scoring on 54% TS for a lottery team, you‚Äôd say that team should improve on them to increase your playoff odds.  If you were able to acquire someone like Jerami Grant or Harrison Barnes, and you went into the playoffs with a Lonzo-Lavine-Demar-Grant/Barnes-Vuc with Caruso/Green/Bradley rotating in and Lavine/Demar playing 40+ minutes staggered, that bench scoring punch you talk about becomes soooo much less important"
Would Jerami Grant be not taking 20 shots? He left Denver cuz he didn't want to be a role player.
"Seems inevitable IMO. /r/chicagobulls killed me when I proposed the DJJ &amp; Coby for Jerami Grant trade.  There's just too many guys in the backcourt who can play actual minutes. Lavine, Lonzo, Jevonte, Caruso, Ayo... Even DeRozan's natural position is shooting guard.   There's just not enough minutes for Coby if all those other guys are producing well."
"Dame's dad and brother are Houston, and his son's middle name as well. And Jerami Grant was born in Portland. Coincidence? I think ~~not~~ probably"
"All Harvey Grant kids are HJ.  Imagine going to the Grant Chrismas, Horace, Harvey, Holdyn, Houston and Harvey Jr..  Or Horace, Harvey, Jerami, Jerian, Jerai"
"Yeah I think the next FRP the Wiz can trade is in 2024. But I'm not entirely sure. Either way if they were to trade for a third star like Jerami Grant, Pascal Siakam, or someone else, one of Rui or Deni would have to be traded."
"I don't think it's that likely but if the blazers would bite on something like CJ for tobias and a pick, that would open up a lot of options for the sixers. Imagine a core trio of CJ/jerami grant/embiid or CJ/barnes/embiid."
That we will trade them Jerami Grant. He wants to be here and we want to keep him.
"There are actually so many, I had no idea. Other than the ones you listed, JJJ, Domantis Sabonis, Ed Davis, Al Horford, with Jerami Grant and Jae Crowder as small ball options."
"Good one. Let‚Äôs not act like Siakam is actually good. He‚Äôs a marginally better version of Jerami Grant, and that dude is a pine riding bum"
"That's probably just you at the time everyone undoubtedly  had at least the warriors (the old superteam gsw) rockets(harden and cp3 they just came off a season winning 65 games and taking the warriors to 7) And thunder (prime russ,PG13,Jerami Grant and Steven Adams) and a lot of other people had teams like portland and the jazz ranked in front of them.  Most people had the lakers finishing 4-6 and a small percentage had them finishing 8th. The west was considered super deep back then it was back when the west was the west. I was online  a lot on forums,YouTube comments,discord at the time and that was what people were saying at the time"
"Tbf, at this time last season people also thought Chris Boucher and Jerami Grant were front runners for MIP. We gotta wait at least another 15-20 games before making a firm judgement."
I‚Äôm not sure we can say we killed it with the trade for the Maxey pick when we gave up both Jerami Grant and Fultz for it. I‚Äôm very happy with Maxey but there is a lot of history behind that pick.
The Rockets have no incentive to win. They should trade him and get some more picks or young guys. Same as the Pistons with Jerami Grant.
"The ""he's only putting up numbers on a bad team"" argument only works when that bad team is giving said player a super long leash and running the offense through him. I,E Jerami Grant and Dion Waiters that one season with the Heat  Wood is playing within the system right now in Houston. His stats are completely natural. He's not being prioritized over anyone else."
I would gladly trade for Jerami Grant. He's a good player even if he's currently playing poorly.
Jerami Grant?
Jerami Grant
"Injuries, out of shape, and years long of habits that clearly don‚Äôt work anymore. He isn‚Äôt as aggressive as he was just last season before his hamstring injury and is hesitant to attack the paint against defenders or sometimes shoot in general. Even had a moment against Detroit where he had an open 3 but did a pump fake and allowed Jerami Grant to recover, and iirc, completely iced himself from the offense on the final, crucial stretch of the game."
Dude if you managed to get Jerami grant out of Turner that'd be a great return. He's basically a similar level player (maybe a bit worse but at a more desirable position) and is a drastically better fit with Sabonis
Jerami Grant is worth more than that and he actually wants to be in Detroit. No way they trade him for Bouknight and a few seconds.
Detroit is not trading Jerami Grant...

I think if the sixers trade simmons for someone like (as a pistons fan I don't want this) Jerami Grant and roll players they would be contenders. Their team seems to fit better this year than years past and I think Seth will keep playing this good.
"What kind of return can I get for jerami grant in a punt pts build? Need more asts, and Rebs, some more blocks wouldn't hurt. Can't be a C"
Is jerami grant tradeable?
other than Cade Cunningham and Jerami Grant (and occasionally Saddiq Bey and Kelly Olynyk) they don't have anyone else on the team with a scorer's mentality
ahh so Jerami Grant is the goat
Jerami Grant for Myles Turner + first
his wife cheated on him multiple times &amp; left him for fkn jerami grant of all players
People say this but who should they of traded for? The pistons traded 3 FRPs for jerami grant
Jerami Grant slander is absurd. He's been straight up balling since he got to Detroit. Always big respect to guys who bet on themselves.

"Facu was never going to be the first guard off the bench, but injury to Murray changed that. I think he was supposed to be low minutes energy guy, especially with shooters around him.  2 years ago Nuggets bench was: Monte, Malik Beasley, MPJ, Jerami Grant, and Plumdogg"
"I watched him on the heat as well and Pistons Kelly feels a bit different. On the heat he played a definitive role, while on our team he's honestly probably the best player behind jerami grant. Has more greenlight to play and do more"
Jerami Grant
Can I interest you in a slightly used Jerami Grant?
Jerami Grant is definitely an above average forward
"""For me it was good to get out of a sinking ship, and boarding the titanic"" Jerami Grant probably"
"It's futile but I also really like trying to predict MIP, because despite often the winner being completely out of the blue there's a set of guidelines that *feel* very intuitive;  * The player will be in at least their third season (second-years rarely win) though likely fourth or later * The player will be in a position where they have a new, or bigger, role (just moved teams, a significant teammate has left, a new coach has come in, etc) * The player will not be older than 30 * The player will already have some ability to score * The player will not have been averaging more than 20ppg  And, to me at least, all of those seem about right and if you follow those steps you tend to come up with a surprisingly small list of names who usually appear high on the betting odds and show up in the MIP candidates throughout the season - see Jerami Grant last season, for example. And I do all that and feel really smart when Jerami Grant is in the conversation, but it's always a case of Julius Randle being like 'Hey I shoot the three really good now', or Miles Bridges is now suddenly taking twice as many shots as he did last season despite the roster being largely unchanged except actually they *added* a lottery pick and their nominal star player returned from injury."
No Jerami Grant?
"If only the Process Sixers let Hinkie finish what he started. At one point they had:  Embiid/Noel/Okafor Saric/Holmes Covington/Jerami Grant Simmons McConnell  Knowing Hinkie, he would still snag JJ Redick and flip Okafor and Noel for much better assets"
"We need scoring off the bench and run small lineups. I don‚Äôt see Coby getting traded unless if it‚Äôs for like Jerami grant, which I don‚Äôt see pistons doing."

"In the vacuum of ""seasoned vet signs with terrible and young team at a contract that goes from being overpaid to underpaid immediately"" well... He's the best thing since Jerami Grant."
"I think they need Gary Trent Jr, Gary Payton II, Glenn Robinson III, Bol Bol, Cole Anthony, Seth Curry, Jerami Grant, Austin Rivers, Kenyon Martin Jr, Jaren Jackson Jr, Domantas Sabonis, and Larry Nance Jr.  They need all the second gens.  That'll be enough."
"I always believed the Thunder picked up Jerami Grant so that old people watching would still hear ""Kevin Durant"" and not be caused unnecessary stress by his departure. I'm not sure what they've told those poor people now."
Can't say I've watched much of either before this year but he impressed me defending Jerami Grant.  Vital and effective with some big stops in the 4th in a game they could've lost.
"His on-ball defense has really been great. Bullock always took the hardest assignment last year, now Barrett is stepping up. All-NBA will be a tough sell for this year, but he's following the steps of Kawhi, Butler, and PG, these big wings who built their games on defense and let the offense come later. I'm not saying he'll be as good as them, or even close, but its a solid game plan to follow. Jerami Grant is a good example of guys who can follow that game plan productively without being on those guys' level"

I‚Äôd rather have Christian Wood than Jerami Grant
I sincerely doubt it was to the tune of more than what they payed Jerami Grant.
"I think Jerami Grant is filling in nicely though, is he not?"
"Jerami Grant, Mikal Bridges make it intriguing for me"
"Yeah but he is worth more than what Houston paid him .  I really thought he would get something closer to what Jerami Grant got, but he got  far less"
Wasn‚Äôt he on The Process Sixers?  Just like Jerami Grant and Richaun Holmes?
Jerami Grant helped a LOT in that regard
Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee. They made the wrong moves in the off-season.
"I respect your opinion on this matter but I honestly couldn't disagree more.   Fans are such a huge part of the ambience and experience to me and that holds true on virtually any level of play. Even when playing, coaching, and watching high school basketball, Tuesday night winter road games an hour away against a non-rival were the worst because you were often playing in a mostly empty gym; it felt like a half step above a scrimmage.  As a preference, nothing beats a rabid, sold-out crowd. But even short of that, I'd even take 10,000 people cheering for the Pistons at LCA at this point. There *has* been a sense of acclamation to it all but I'll never prefer it. Every time I see a crazy poster or buzzer-beater in today's game, I can't help but wonder how much cooler it would have felt if fans had been there.   [Like, here's Jerami Grant a few nights ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJgGnCRXTcs&amp;ab_channel=ChazNBA)  [Here's Jerami Grant when fans existed.](https://youtu.be/YE7DLJWItUk?t=16)  [Here's a buzzer-beater without fans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJOkrA3VB7c&amp;ab_channel=BleacherReport)  [Here's a buzzer-beater with fans.](https://youtu.be/fSVzjUP8dVs?t=6)  It's no contest to me. I can't wait until fans are safely back."
"Before Murray lit it up in the bubble there was a discussion on the Dunc‚Äôd on podcast about whether Jerami Grant was their second best player.  Grant was their best defensive player and he and Plumlee are gone, Murray has regressed back towards the mean and MPJ hasn‚Äôt taken a step forward on defense to be kind.  They‚Äôve lost a couple close games and should still be alright, although I don‚Äôt expect to see them in the conference finals again this year."
"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bendowsett/2020/06/29/rudy-goberts-improved-perimeter-defense-is-an-major-tool-for-the-utah-jazz/  ‚ÄúThe NBA‚Äôs stingiest defenders against isolation possessions, per that same tracking data (minimum 75 possessions defended, a sample of 130 players):  1.    Rudy Gobert: 0.688 points per chance allowed  2.    Jerami Grant: 0.702 points per chance  3.    Jrue Holiday: 0.709 points per chance  For those who don‚Äôt spend their days studying NBA scoring numbers: That‚Äôs really low. Even when you add roughly 0.15 to a team‚Äôs figure to account for potential offensive rebounds on misses (standard among math folks in the league), you‚Äôre talking about efficiency in the low-80s on a per-100-possession basis ‚Äì the NBA‚Äôs worst offense averaged just under 105 this year by comparison.‚Äù  Tell me again how he can‚Äôt guard the perimeter. I swear to god, most of you people watch some highlights of Curry or Chris Paul putting Gobert on skates and that‚Äôs formed your entire opinion of his defense. Read up on him before before spouting your uninformed take.   Same thing with his offense. He isn‚Äôt amazing, but he‚Äôs a great screen setter, good roll man and a lob threat. He is not a liability on offense.   With him, the Jazz are a decent playoff team with an outsize chance at WCF / Finals. Without him, they‚Äôre a lottery team and Mitchell leaves. So yes, you do pay him the 200 million over him leaving. Does it mean he‚Äôs worth 200m, especially comparing him to other centers like Embiid or Jokic? No. But he‚Äôs worth 200m to the Jazz because of their circumstances as a small market team. I don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs so hard to grasp."
"Yeah true. I keep making memes about how jokic‚Äôs back hurts from carrying. Barton plays hero ball too much. Green looked ok last night, but he isn‚Äôt Jerami grant.  Dozier is decent IMO. But we have no backup center."
I'm honestly mad that Jerami Grant left the Nuggets to do slog in mediocrity for the Pistons. Nuggets got fucked so hard.   I get that Grant wanted the bag and playing time but man it's hard to digest.
"Exactly, Russ is a great teammate despite the rockets  scapegoating him, guys like oladipo, pg, jerami grant, steven adams, all day russ played a role in some portion of their game because he worked so hard and cares for his guys so much."
"You mean we chose jerami grant, who‚Äôs been dropping 20 a game and can play defense and has never had a history of attitude issues?"
Makes me smile seeing Process era Sixers finding their way around the league.   Christian Wood  Richaun Holmes  Jerami Grant   Others like Tj McConnell and Ish Smith  Put some respect on Sam Hinkie's name.
you don't think jerami grant is worth 3/60?  /s

Who is better between him and Jerami Grant?
"I dont watch Nuggets games but i think losing Jerami Grant has been huge for y‚Äôall, no?"
"Yes I referenced his one game when telling the original commenter to calm down, I could have gone more in depth he‚Äôs gotten 24 points while being inefficient a couple times. ( guy is a extreme weirdo btw he‚Äôs in my inbox cause of this).    Besides that tho Did you not see my second comment where I put down the stat lines for all his games? He hasn‚Äôt just had one bad game he‚Äôs had a couple bad ones a couple average ones and then one good game. And no that‚Äôs not true if you took away Nikola jokic top 3 performances from last year he still looked great. The thing is that this is a ‚ÄúEXTREMELY SMALL‚Äù sample size but that goes over pistons fans heads. I guess when jerami grant is all you have to be excited about it‚Äôs dark times."
"Yeah, I mentioned in another comment that even trading MPJ may not have been enough for the role he wants. His game is reminiscent of Kawhi to me (though not necessarily with such a high ceiling), and it‚Äôs a skill set worth trying to capitalize on.  In terms of leaving as a free agent over not being the first option, as opposed to staying somewhere and remaining as a first option (Giannis), moving to a different franchise but being the first option on either team (Kawhi to Clippers or Durant to Nets), the most recent examples that come to my mind are James Harden to the Rockets or possibly Jimmy Butler to the Bulls (though that was a messier situation).  Usually when someone moves for a bigger role it seems like a sixth man wants to start at wing, not that someone wants to take over a franchise. But who‚Äôs going to box out Jerami Grant, Andre Drummond? Good for him if he can do it."
\- the Phoenix Suns will be the number one seed in the West  \- Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook aren't in their prime anymore (not that hot)  \- Christian Wood is one of the 3 or 4 best offensive big man in the league  \- Jerami Grant is worth his contract  \- Mikal Bridges is better than Deandre Ayton  \- Jaylen Brown is better than Jayson Tatum  \- Kelly Oubre isn't the worst player in NBA history  \- What James Wiseman has shown in his first games isn't that promising defensively
"Thank god for Jerami tbh, I was so pissed we let go of Wood but Grant looks like a better player already ..."
"Mannnn Jerami Grant has really surprised all of Detroit, we scoffed at him wanting to have a bigger offensive role and he‚Äôs out here fucking dunking on Theis, averaging 24 ppg and staying solid defensively! Looking like an all star at this rate.   Saddiq Bey also looking like one of the best rookies of the draft - cant believe we got him at 19 and Killian at 7 lol.    Fully deserved win for the Pistons, loved our tenacity and grit, but Boston also really shit the bed. Went completely scoreless in the last 4 minutes, were awful in the first half, and were only in it due to some Tatum heroics. Excited for the rematch on Sunday üëÄ"

"So you would upvotes the statement, jerami grant sucks pig farts?"
"Jerami Grant is slowly becoming the best signing of the season, I can't believe the Nuggets let him go for nothing."
"I am sure even Jerami Grant had no clue he was about to be given the chance to be first option on a team. Free agency is just that - it's **free** agency.        Your front office should have extended him when you traded for him. That's the risk they ran with rentals. Once Barton sorts out his health you guys will be fine, you can always swing a trade if needed too."
"Yo Nuggets fan. Are you still gonna tell me you do not miss Jerami Grant on this team? He was by far your best athlete and best defender at the forward position and overall most versatile defender that can switch, can provide some rim protection etc.  Do you miss him now"
nuggets should have held on to jerami grant now they are trash without him.
"Defense bad, bubble Murray isn't real, and they miss Jerami Grant"
"Fuck it I've resisted drinking the kool aid on my Detroit teams for too long, I am now accepting jerami grant as my Lord and savior"
"Man, what is wrong with the nuggets. Was jerami grant that important? Or is it something to do with will barton and gary harris being absolute trash"
Also Jerami Grant is apparently the greatest two way player of all time
Jerami Grant was the key &gt;.&gt;
Nobody wanted jerami grant until 5th round in my draft so I got the steal
Jerami Grant never actually said why he left
Man I would change my name to Jerami ‚Äúoverpaid‚Äù Grant. They were clowning him and I‚Äôm glad dude came out and balled the fuck out this season. Love it
"Where's all those motherfuckers including a whole lotta pistons flairs that were talking shit on my boy Jerami before the season started. He can't do this, he can't do that, why would you pay a role player that much money. Grant out here shitting on all that."
Everyone on this thread sleeping on Jerami Grant. Only 4 games of course but I feel like he is the closest competitor to Wood for MIP. He left Denver for a bigger role and so far he has excelled in it. He is supposed to be the #2 guy behind Blake but a couple more weeks and I think it will be his team.   Also it is impossible to talk about Sexton without talking about Garland. Sexland is probably the most improve back court in the NBA.
Domantas Sabonis and Jerami Grant
