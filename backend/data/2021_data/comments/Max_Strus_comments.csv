we all know the reason why max strus cooled down after the half and malik didnt. Strus' shooting was a fluke and malik is averaging 36 ppg for the rest of the season.
uhh we have no perimeter defense either. Every hornets fan could have told you some random guy was gonna rain threes on us. And kelly olynyk and max strus did that
"Nah, Max Strus maybe"
Imagine getting torched by a man called Max Strus
Coming into this thread to ask who tf is Max Strus. please and thank you
I'm enjoying this shootout between Malik Monk and Max Strus.
Good to see some play time for Celtics 2019 Summer League Team Legend For Exactly One Game Max Strus
"8 player roster, jimmy only playing 6 games, spo disrespecting bad teams by experimenting with shit lineups on them. man run a chris silva and max strus lineup in the 4th quarter while we were down 10 it’s cool when we’re winning but it is time to end that tradition"
"Max Strus was not part of the trade. It was PA, DR, TH, KN, FRP and DS"
wow max strus looks exactly like georges niang and also both are #31 which is an odd jersey number
So Ben is healthy. Did you miss the whole our starting lineup is herro-duncan-iggy-max strus-olynyk thing?
"Whatever, yall didn't deserve to witness Max Strus anyways"
"Heat vs Sixers, headlined by Max Strus vs Matisse Thybulle"
"What's going on with this article? It's a very simple look at our season so far. Jimmy's scoring average is brought down tremendously by the game he got hurt against where he only played 16 minutes and the game immediately coming back against Dallas. In the 3 other games he's played, he's put up 19, 18, and 26. Bam's been great for us, probably our best player so far. Sure he could limit his turnovers but I'm not sure why offensive rebounding is an area of concern. We don't really focus on offensive rebounding.   &gt;The Heat are also in the bottom half of the league in three-point percentage. In a league won beyond the arc, they are only hitting around 36% of their shots from deep, the 17th lowest in the league.  We are 16th in 3pt%. That's middle of the pack lol.   &gt;For a team in the top half of the league in pace, they aren’t shooting like it.  We're 21st in pace so this is just flat out wrong lol  &gt;The Heat have 7 rotational players shooting below 34% from beyond the arc.  Technically, I guess this is true. But it's counting Max Strus (who's only played 1 game), KZ (who's only played in 3 games), Mo and Nunn who are seeing a combined 20 mpg. It also ignored the fact that we have 4 actual rotation players shooting &gt;40% from 3."
"This is a gross oversimplification of Bam's defense lol. Dude guards all 5 positions every night, switching every pick and roll, covering for defensive mistakes made by putrid defenders like Olynyk, Duncan, Herro, Dragic, etc. He regularly bottles up perimeter stars into passing away from that matchup. Numbers don't equate for this shit lol.   Bam is a top 5 defender in the NBA. Miami has a top 5-6 defense with 3 positive defenders on it and 10 horrendous ones on it. Like, worst in the league bad. Orlando has a below average defense. 18th in drtg and 22nd in field goal % against. There is a grand canyon gap between Bam's defense and Vucevic's. The gap between them defensively is probably 5x the difference between them offensively.   Bam is close to Gobert defensively, if not certainly more useful come playoff time. Utah somehow has a worse defensive field goal % against than we do despite the fact that Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Goran Dragic, Kelly Olynyk, Gabe Vincent, Max Strus are arguably bottom 20 defensive players of anyone getting minutes in the NBA."
All stars Gabe Vincent and Max Strus just had an off night.
Very disappointed max strus didn’t make it.
"Nicolo ""Max Strus"" Melli"
"Max ""Contract"" Strus"
Max Don’t Mind If I Do Strus
Max Strus is secretly a Laker fan
  hell of a way to find out Max Strus even exists
"Really went 0-7 while the commentators kept on saying ""shooters shoot"". I honestly just can't believe that Gabe Vincent and fucking Max Strus are two guys in our rotation this season"
I wish I had Max Strus confidence jesus christ.
I wish I had Max Strus confidence jesus christ.
&gt; Max Strus is the 8th player in NBA history to attempt at least 8 three-pointers in 12 or fewer minutes. He's the first to not make one of them.  Who gave Max Strus the greenest of lights?
I wish I had Max Strus confidence jesus christ.
Max Strus is a 1st ballot hall of famer
"Max Strus, more like Max Stress amirite"
"Welcome to Burger King, my name is Max Strus, would you like to super size your order for $0.99?  Regards,  Tomorrow"
max strus has dion waiters mentality
Yea he’s a FA after this season. I’m hoping we can fit Max Strus right on in where Duncan was bc I’m sure someone’s gonna want to put him something he’s not gonna end up being worth
"Yeah, remember Gabe Vincent and Max Strus in the bubble? They were all stars in the bubble."
The only guy who can save the Heat now is Max Strus
Max Strus said ‘give me the ball and gtfo the way’ lmao  EDIT: and then put up some bullshit lmfao
"Bam is 58x the defender Sabonis is while being comparable offensively lol. I mean Bam somehow anchored a top 16 defense while Jimmy and AB were out while we played Herro, Dragic, Duncan, Kelly, Nunn, Precious, Gabe Vincent, and Max Strus. These are all negative as FUCK defenders."
"PF/C’s men have the most value here.  “Traditionally” handsome bigs are rare.    Maybe the Heat?  Jimbo, Bam, Goran.  Nunn, Leonard and Herro are pretty good looking guys.  Max Strus is a tall, thicc Gael Garcia Bernal, which I just argued with my wife over the other night during his threes bonanza."
Full PP  Max Strus and Duncan Robinson  DRose and Randle  Carushow and Kuzma  Lopez and Holiday  Curry and (insert bad player)  Steph Curry and Wiggins  Luka and Boban  A1 and A2  KD and Harden
Max strus has played a good number of games for us already
Celtics legend Max Strus. The disrespect
Max Strus the GOAT.
"Give him the Max, Strus"
Who tf is Max Strus
Max Strus vs Malik Monk. Maybe if Spo believed his power enough Heat would have won
Who is Max Strus and why is he Michael Jordan
"Max ""Contract"" Strus"
Who tf max strus. He killin tonight
Max Strus is the best player in the league
Tyler Herro bout to get Drew Bledsoe'd for Max Strus.
I just got home and turned on the game... Max strus 16pts... who??
"""Max Strus""  They should have Barkley play ""Who He Play For"" every single week, and the 5 players are players who have: 1) played in a TNT game or 2)started a game within the past week. He'd still go 1/5 at best."
good god we’re getting the Max Strus game
Haha man as a Celtics fan I remember Max Strus. It was him vs Javonte a few years back for a roster spot.
"For real. In a game against the sixers this season the heat started herro, ollynyk, precious, gabe Vincent, and Duncan Robinson. They all played for close to 40 minutes each. Oh, and how can I forget about six man of the year, max strus. He really carried our offense this season. Can’t imagine how hard it must be for kyrie and James harden."
"Max strus played well enough for people to readily add Drob to trades for a couple weeks. And Gabe Vincent has had games where you realize why he gets minutes, and then games where you realize there’s a reason why he’s only a 2 way player."
"They've had a lot of injuries/Covid issues.   I think at one point, they played the Sixers twice in a row starting guys like Max Strus and Gabe Vincent."
Max Strus is leading us back to the Finals.
"Depends how high we are on Max Strus.    Hes looked really good in the minutes he’s got, but it’s probably a stretch to pretend he can replace one of the best 3p shooters in the league"
Fully healthy they also have Tyler dragic nunn Dedmon iggy dipo/Duncan bjelica precious achiuwa. Max strus has been giving great minutes kz is a good defender but has some potential offensively and gabe isn’t great but he’s a role guy who can cover if you have no one else which at times the heat havnt
Thats a really funny way of spelling Max Strus
So who the fuck is Max Strus?
Don't you think for example the staff and players would've liked to start the fourth quarter tonight with an actual functionnal line up instead of playing Max Strus at the 4 ?
"For Miami idk if it’s even possible for us to put together a good package without including Bam.. that being said Bam is untouchable, I’ll ship Jimmy out before I ship a hair on Bam’s buttcheek. So realistically we can give Herro, Precious Achiuwa, KZ Okpala, picks, maybe sign and trade of Duncan Robinson if possible..   The end goal is to have Dame with Jimmy and Bam.. We’ll fill out the rest of the roster with Max Strus and some G Leaguers"
"not current but back in the day it was DJ Mbenga, Jeff Foster, Kelena Azabuike, and Birdman Andersen. Now I’d probably say Max Strus, MCW, and Thansasis."
"I mean, that's kinda over-looking the small detail that EVERYBODY on the Heat was out while Jimmy was out. So was Dragic. We were playing the likes of Gabe Vincent and Max Strus gigantic minutes. It's harsh to just fault Bam, as I don't think Simmons would have won a lot if Tobias Harris and Seth were also out.   I don't think Bam will ever be a superstar OR capable of leading an offense. But he can be a DPOY-caliber player who can get you 18-20PPG with the right offense. We don't have that offense at the moment."
Who gonna score on Jrue?  Cmon now you gonna send in Max Strus or some junk lmao
"No, they didn't. Sources came out with Houston's asking price.  - Herro, Duncan, Precious &amp; Nunn (combined salary: $9,732,122) - Salary Filler ($31,522,798 worth) - Two 1st-Round Picks (miami only has their 2022/2024) - 4 Pick Swaps (legitimately did not have enough picks to swap)  That means mortgaging the future in two ways: the young players **and** the pick economy for 2-and-a-half years of James Harden. Not to mention that Miami's only way to create the filler would've been to trade Olynyk &amp; Iguodala for Harden at the last minute.  But fuck it, because *Oh please...* came so easily to you, here's what the roster makeup would've looked like fresh out of the trade, completely ignoring that we didn't have the picks or the swaps for Houston.  PG: Goran Dragic/Gabe Vincent (2-Way)  SG: James Harden/Max Strus (2-Way)  SF: Jimmy Butler/Trevor Ariza (who was acquired with a 2027 SRP + meyers)  PF: Nemanja Bjelica/KZ Okpala   C: Bam Adebayo/Dewayne Dedmon (f/a signing)  If you think **that** 10-man rotation does any better against the Milwaukee Bucks than the one we've pushed out there twice, you're completely out of your mind. Go Hornets."
"Good Point, Reggie. This is good for Max Strus."
Max Strus
He watched Max Strus highlights and now he’s shook
"Being forced to play Precious, Max Strus, KZ, and Vincent almost made me hard quit the year."
"They can have Herro for Dame, but KZ Okpala and Max Strus are way off limits!"
Jimmy Butler  Bam Adebayo  Duncan Robinson  Max Strus  Omer Yurtseven  Gabe Vincent
Aww no Suggs putback or Max Strus game winner?
"Max Strus getting some love. I know probably no one outside Heat fans know who he is, but he’s been great in Cali and Vegas"
A young kid trying to make it in the league better be more valuable than Max Strus or Gabe Vincent.
"Because it’s Max Strus, if Jalen Green or Cade hit the same shot it would be one of the hottest post on the sub"
Summer League legend Max Strus
Celtics legend Max Strus
"This summer league has me in love with Max Strus and Omer Yurtseven.  But in six months I will probably want to trade them both for a stick of gum and an Arby's coupon, and I don't go to Arby's."
Then it turns out we didn’t need the clock because Max Strus is a cold blooded bastard
Max Strus the white Larry Bird
It’s all fun and games until Max Strus is the 2022 Finals MVP
Holy shit. Max Strus was one of my neighbors. I played baseball with his older brother. His dad was the coach of my little league team.
"I think you hit it right on the bullseye. Teams need to scout their potential talent. Sure, playing with the worry of fouling out may be a good skill to have. But as we know, nba foul calls can be pretty odd sometimes. These guys are playing against other new young talents and are still getting a feel for the way the nba calls fouls.   On another note, Max Strus is insane. I watched him live in SAC and he can shoot the lights out as well as being a power finisher at the rim."
1. Dion Waiters  2. Tyler Johnson  3. Wayne Ellington  4. Rodney McGruder  5. Gabe Vincent  6. KZ Okpala  7. Max Strus  8. James Johnson  9. Justise Winslow  10. Greg Oden
Omer and Max Strus sonned then though
half of this is Max Strus? lolol
UD or Max Strus.
Jimmy missed a ton of time. Dragic. Herro. Nunn missed time. Dipo only ended up playing 4 games for us. Even Bam missed time. Avery Bradley was hurt all year. The Heat were playing straight bum gleaguers Max Strus and Gabe Vincent significant time lol
"Would you care if someone showed the best players in 2019-2020 by PER but included people who didn't have the minutes qualification and then said that based on that that it wouldn't be ludicrous for the all-NBA First Team to be Shamorie Ponds, Jamal Crawford, Max Strus, Jonathan Motley, and Tacko Fall?? All with 28+ PER!!!!  Hell, even just among qualified players, Hassan Whiteside and Andre Drummond made it into the top 20."

Big east legend max strus
DePaul legend Max Strus
Not Hornets-killer Max Strus!
"When I was in uni, I had Max Strus around finals time."
Bulls legend Max Strus
Oh you mean the 2k21 expansion team GOAT Max Strus?? League ain’t ready
Oh you don't know about Max Strus...you will.
"Herro? And people said Bam can’t shoot, and he came out as one of the most efficient 2 pt shooter last season. Keep doubting. Where did DRob came from? You’ll be surprised with Heat development team, watch Max Strus this year."
"People are gonna be surprised by Max Strus this year, I can already feel it. Herro, Oladipo, Strus, Morris/Tucker, Dedmon is a solid 5 off the bench. Use Vincent or 1 of the 2 way guys until Oladipo returns."
"Our guys play hard and give it all on the court from start to finish. We're one of the top teams in the league when it comes to developing players and we're always looking to compete. In our 33 years as a team, we only missed the playoffs 11 times. We got swept badly in the playoffs last year, but we made some moves and are in the process of making some trades to come back stronger this season because, as I said before, we want to compete. We have a balanced roster of old and young players. I suggest watching highlights of Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, and Max Strus. Those are some of our young guys. We have arguably the best coach in the league by the name of Erik Spolestra. We pride ourselves on what we like to call Heat Culture, which is giving it all on the court until the final buzzer as I said in the first sentence. Overall, you'll feel very satisfied as a Heat fan while watching our games."
"PG: Kyle Lowry  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: Duncan Robinson  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Bam Adebayo  Key Bench Players: Tyler Herro, Victor Oladipo, Max Strus, Markieff Morris, Dewayne Dedmon"
"Nunn is a bench player who wasn't getting minutes during the bubble run. He went into the season behind Dragic/Robinson/Herro/Bradley in the guard rotation. Using his per-game statistics in a season where he started due to injuries, and using those statistics to argue in his favor, implies you believe he was already good enough to get those minutes, even without the injuries.   If injuries aren't the reason he played, why was he cut out of the rotation during the bubble run? Why did he lose his minutes the following season to Avery Bradley? Why was he let go in favor of an injured Oladipo and an unproven Max Strus?"
We will trade the GOAT Max Strus for him
"The second he would see Jimmy matched up on him, the dude would just yeet the ball to someone else. He was so scared to try and shoot unless Max Strus or Duncan Robinson were guarding him lmao"
Max Strus Bulls legend
"Why do all the Celtics 15th men go on to become decent rotation players elsewhere? And why can't we keep any of these guys who would clearly be better than many of our current options?   Abdel Nader, PJ Dozier, Max Strus, and now Javonte Green."
Max Strus is gonna be an interesting case study of this this season.
"Dwyane Dedmon, Tyler Herro, Max Strus happened"
"Max Strus is so underrated. Went D2 then transferred to DePaul. Went updrafted and signed with the Bull’s G-league, then made his way onto the Heat rotation"
"Korkmaz comes to mind, guys like Max Strus and D’Andre Bembry as well"
"I'm not even saying I think we're incredibly good, I'd argue we have produced more starter caliber players over the last say 5 years, but not trying to big us up too much.  I'm just saying I don't really see the heat that way. Herro and Nunn are both really solid but are only entering their 3rd years, I think Tyler Johnson is fine, Max Strus is not even close to a success story yet, Wayne Ellington is not a Heat Development success, he was a vet that upped his PPG .7 with the Heat and Hassan Whiteside has almost played himself out of the league cause hes the definition of an empty stats centre.  Bam, Robinson and maybe Herro/Nunn (lets see how this year goes) are players you can hang your hat on developing but I'd argue your org is best known for having veteran players buy into coaching and system, not finding coal and shaping them into diamonds.  While we're not supernatural I'd stack FVV, OG, Siakam &amp; Norm Powell against any players developed by the Heat."

"So many takeaways. Not just what Lowry does for us, but it feels like all our young core players got better.  * Bam, Tyler, and Duncan all got bigger and faster * PJ feels like Ariza and Iggy combined into one person * Probably too early to judge but it seemed like Max Strus and Gabe Vincent (and maybe even KZ) took steps, though Gabe still needs to rein in those turnovers  And these two impressed:  * Caleb Martin. I didn't even know we had this dude, apparently we two-way'd him in mid-September. I don't know if his game tonight is representative of what he can usually do, but he showed out * Omer Yurtseven. He played his first NBA minutes tonight. In just 14 minutes he got a team-leading 8 rebounds. He's still green and made all the typical rookie mistakes like too many fouls and low shot clock awareness, but he absolutely did his job and filled his role"
How dare you disrespect Max Strus like this.
From Chicago   Played Vs Max Strus and Jalen Brunson   Saw Jabari Parker/Jahlil Okafor sectional games @ my school every year   Almost Played Cliff Alexander in Playoffs but his team was using Ineligible Players lol  And my brother got Dunked on By Iman Shumpert
"He really isn’t a point guard that’s why Miami got Lowry, Wall would help a lot and completely eliminate players like Gabe Vincent and Max Strus and also probably take time from Duncan Robinson who honestly needs to get his shooting together before Oladipo comes back or he will be losing minutes to him as well. If Miami got Wall and Oladipo comes back healthy I don’t think anyone can beat Miami"
"Don't forget ""Max Strus"""
"Robinson better watch his back, Max ""Contract"" Strus is comin for that ass"
Max Strus was clutch af for us
Because Max Strus has been fucking out lmao. Whyre you speaking on a team you know nothing about? Caleb is getting Strus’ minutes and Strus usually played more than Dedmon anyway
That Max Strus injury hurts more and more every day.  I don’t know if Duncan can handle another performance like last night.
"Bro all we need is a max strus and we win every game of the season, idk who this butler bum is"
"Max Strus and Markieff Morris are out, Bam and Dedmon in foul trouble."
"And Max Strus, Tyler Johnson, Kendrick Nunn, etc etc, and even Haslem himself"
This game should make it apparent that Max Strus is very important to the team.
throw in max strus and you got yourself a deal
Miami Heat: Sandwich - Tyler Herro The Strus is Loose - Max Strus
"Miami scouts deserve a huge fucking bonus after nailing on Herro and Adebayo, but also finding Duncan Robinson and Max Strus.   Honestly even Josh Richardson wasn't bad (solid roleplayer)... and if Justise could just fucking stay healthy."
"Probably taking Max Strus' minutes at the 2 depending on what's needed, Strus slides over to the 3 which I guess would be Caleb Martin's minutes though we don't really play him much anyway.  Complete second unit composition would likely be 1-Herro 2-Oladipo 3-Strus 4-Morris 5-Dedmon  Oladipo's defense against weaker second units would just be unfair."
Give Illinois Max Strus instead of Nader
"Yo Heat fans, how is Max Strus realistically? I remember him in Summer League and tearing everyone apart. How well does he translate now? And how's this guy name Yurt7?"
I hope Max Strus is ok. Please be just a sprain :(
Max Strus with the +22 in 19 minutes
I apologise for any time I ever said anything bad about Max Strus.
"As much as I love Tyler, they won't. Tyler will be in a 6th man role this year. Duncan needs to be in the starting lineup as an off ball player and he also provides more spacing than Tyler Herro. If Duncan is not on the line up Max Strus will probably be in, as Herro still needs to save energy to be the primary ball handler + scorer on the second unit  Just look at the defence when he goes for a DHO, they're doubling with a hand up and also pulling jerseys so he won't get a shot off lol"
