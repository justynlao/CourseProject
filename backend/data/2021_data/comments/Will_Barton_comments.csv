"there goes his trade value, we’ll give you will barton and gary harris for him, deal?"
grant leaving was a byproduct of keeping will barton happy  same for having to get rid of beasley for pennies on the dollar  letting plumlee walk was just a kroenke masterclass
"yes of course, more minutes for his lordship will barton the 3rd"
"&gt;Who the fuck wants to warm the bench for Will Barton?   Nah man he was obviously gonna start, like he had been doing for a while.   Of course that still isn't enough, cause he would've been the 4th-5th option, and he wanted more."

"We shot 88% from three in the first half. Eighty eight percent, and this was off a high volume of shots too. We were better from three point range than the fucking line. Will Barton was draining contested threes over Rudy's head. There's just nothing you can do when a team's that hot."
will barton  -michael malone
I would agree Harris has been here a long time him and Barton been here the longest and Malone is a loyal guy so I agree it's a good idea but will it happen is another.  They could try and run him sixth man manu/Lou style but Harris is hurt a lot his shot been off not getting to the rim as well kinda shitty cause he's one of my favorite nuggets
Considering we were top 3 in offense when we had one starter that was top 5 worst 3 point shooters in the league (Gary Harris) and the worst finisher in the league (Will Barton) was absolutely incredible. Jokic was dragging a limping nuggets team to survival. Jokic is incredible.
Will barton plays a yolo brand of basketball. I respect it
"Will Barton lowkey the most enraging part of this game.  I expect insanity from Jokic, but William Barton?  Come on lmao."
"Will ""I don't listen to mere mortals"" barton proves he's really been talking to god."
Will Barton has been on fire
Don't you guy just love when Will Barton waves off jokic so he can iso?
"Not arguing that. But thats an entirely different point than ""he was gonna be warming the bench for will barton."" That's all I was arguing"
"Just an fyi, he wasn't gonna be ""warming the bench for Will Barton.""  He was going to be our starting 4.  We only brought Millsap back after he signed with Detroit.  He was 100% going to start this year and that was always the plan."
"The reason you only hear that the Nuggets ""offered him the same money"" is because they were never given a chance to pay more. He was already gone. Who the fuck wants to warm the bench for Will Barton?   Wood to Houston and Grant to Detroit were both done way before free agency opened."
that michael malone is an idiot and will barton is not a good basketball player

"""The Italian Cock"" Danilo galinari, The baptist john collins, General Soreness Jimmy butler, Punchbob Shitbloke bobby portis, Fartin will barton, lord covington"
Michael Malone is in love with Lord Will Barton III
"No they can't lmao.  MPJ is the only valuable asset that the Nuggets have. Obviously he goes in any Beal trade, but the rest of the salary match is mediocre. Gary Harris? Will Barton? Paul Millsap? What does Washington need with those guys? And there's no way in hell Denver would give Jamal Murray for what could be a Beal rental.  Because of salary match GSW would offer Wiseman, Looney, Oubre and their first. It's a decent offer, but Oubre would be a rental. It's essentially two high firsts for Beal.  Atlanta has the most assets that can be offered and the 76ers have the best player available in Simmons. Tell me how Denver and GSW outbids them?  Go away nephew."
"Will Barton in the 2018-2019 season. He shot 40.2%  from the field, averaged 11.5 a game and was one hell of a facilitator with 2.9 assists per game. The Denver Nuggets made the playoffs that year."
"Definitely Will Barton, but I think most people are just souring on him. He truly is an incredible 6th man. Go out with Monte, run the court, do whatever you want and not have to play within the scheme and freestyle more. If he gets hot, keep him in to close the game, if he's not take him out."
Everyone hates Will Barton but me
"Will Barton, there's some other candidates in Harris and Campazzo but when they have good nights they seem to be given credit. Will the Thrill on the other hand, even when he has a good night most of the sub has nothing nice to say about him even though there's a small minority (myself included) who still really like him."
probably will barton
"Jae, Baze, and Barton will always be heroes to me.  Couldn't have won my first fantasy basketball ship without 'em."
"Miami has Duncan Robinson ,Herro, Nunn more players.  Denver has Gary Harris, will Barton mpj"
"The area where we draft well is hitting on second round picks.  Consistently nabbing guys in the second round that are at least of rotational value is definitely noteworthy.  GTJ, Will Barton, Jake Layman, Pat Connaughton and Allen Crabbe were all second round picks that have had at least stints or more of decent rotational value.  These were all picks made under Neil Olshey.  Yes, you can definitely argue that our first round picks are not very successful.  Obviously Dame and CJ as first round picks were both A+, but as of recent, we've had some less than stellar picks.  The Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan first round picks both in 2017 probably being the worst.  Anfernee Simons as a late first in 2018 is still up for debate, but he's starting to look like a good player as of late.  Overall though, grading the Olshey era of drafting, I'd say the Blazers have been slightly above average."
Will Barton and a 2nd.
"Will WAS on the bench until MPJ got the virus. And other than with Murray and Jokic, Malone always brings players off the bench when returning from injury.  That said, it's not quute clear what is gonna happen in this case simply bc MPJ is exactly what the bench needs (a finisher) and makes that unit look unstoppable (while playing alongside Green and 2 PGs). . The asepct of everything is that Sap is washed defensively and Porter is most comfortable defending the four. So IF Barton can actually get healthy than starting both Will and MPJ might actually make the most sense."
Mate Will Barton is one of my favourite players ever but why the hell would the wizards take that deal?   Harris has looked fine recently but he's getting paid a lot of money for a guy who at times can turn into one of the biggest offensive liabilities in the league. Barton is a perfectly reasonable rotation player on a decent contract. Campazzo might be a nice throw in for a larger deal but as a major piece he isn't worth much. Two first rounders is nice but they would probably fall somewhere in the mid 20s. I don't think any Beal to the Nuggets deal happens without Murray or MPJ.
"I often chit chat with people about how we all need to lower our expectations for these players. Once in a generation talent is simply that: Once in a generation. You can't really fault Wiggins for not turning into LeBron.   You can however win games by playing sound, fundamental basketball, and it seems like Wiggins is starting to do that. TBH he's been excellent this year and I would take him on the Nuggets in a heartbeat over guys like Will Barton and Facundo Campazzo."
He has a lot of similarities to will Barton in his game honestly
For the first time I’d say Joel has a better chance at MVP solely on record. As a Nuggets fan we’ve been picking it up recently but our team has 7 new guys to fit into the roster and the return of Will Barton. Once we get a better record Jokic easily has a better chance than Joel.
"Hes isn't consistent, he will have games where he hits 8/9 and others where he misses them all. I like Barton but he is very hot and cold."
Every commentator agreed with   Booker did not foul harris  Booker did not foul murray  Paul did not foul will fucking barton  I would expect a denver fan to understand logic. Yall take with what you can scrap by with
Will Barton got away with a travel.
"Will Barton needs to stay on the bench, he’s not doing anything tonight."
Mike Malone there is no reason will Barton should be in this game right now
"Not having wings , Malone playing 4 guards when he shouldn't ,Gary and Barton bricking all open shots,Murray being injured,MPJ on Covid since start is all what is making Jokic play alone .   Nuggets gotta trade Barton asap ,look for a decent wing and it will all come together"
"Depends on the player. I’m honestly fine with Murray’s play. Morris, green have been great millsap fills his role adequately. Barton and Harris have disappointed a bit. Facu is bad, very bad. Right now I’d say dozier’s not great but i think he’s out of position.   If we can get another wing. Move dozier to the 2, and bench facu, it’ll look better imo. Get mpj back will help that a lot, doubt we see dozier at the 4 anymore. And i don’t have high hopes for Gary and Barton but they’ll come around a bit."
"It's always a gamble.  Norman Powell, Otto Porter Jr,, will Barton, Ben McLemore...etc  Of course, players that are fairly consistent like Drummond will always show up and show up even better in contract years.  Everyone kind of already drafts them already."
charles would probably trade mitchell for gary harris and will barton
"You have to look beyond the record. Jokic has been utterly dominant, just as much as Embiid has been while also literally running the offense and setting up his teammates - dude leads the league in assists, as a center. He's 4th in the NBA in steals. Leads the league in PER, and is at or near the top in BPM, DRPM, TPA, etc. He's scored or assisted on 42% of the Nuggets made baskets this year, which is the highest percent in the NBA (next closest is Luka at 40%, and PG and Embiid are closer to like 25% each respectively since people are mentioning them). And honestly he's doing this with teammates that mostly have been subpar so far.  What I mean partly - the Nuggets have been incomplete the whole year. Murray hurt his elbow in the 3rd game and hasnt really be right since, missed one game but he's still bothered by it. JaMychal Green missed the first four games, and MPJ missed the last 10, so the Nuggets depth/size at forward has been quite bad mostly. Monte Morris has been steady as always, PJ Dozier is ok, defends well, JaMychal Green has been solid as a backup 4... but Gary Harris is still one of the worst shooters in the NBA, and Will Barton has been wildly up and down (and REALLY cant finish at the rim). Paul Millsap is incapable of finishing in the paint anymore, for the most part. Like, Jokic's teammates have really not been very good, and he still is just dominant (to add a bit more evidence, only 3 Nuggets have a positive net rating when playing without Jokic - Murray, Monte Morris, and PJ Dozier). It's not a stretch to say that Jokic is quite literally the only thing separating the Nuggets from being average right now in record (with the 5th best net rating in the NBA mind you), and being utterly awful, like worst team in the NBA. With him on the floor the Nuggets offensive rating is 120. With him off, it's 97 which is historically bad (and also the largest difference in offensive on-off rating in the NBA by a HUGE margin). If all that doesn't make someone an MVP candidate I dunno what does."
Will Barton would probably average 20 as well
anyhow the moral of the story is that if you can't tell that jerami grant is a better basketball player than will barton then you have no business coaching a basketball team (or commenting about the sport on the internet really)
"it's interesting that there's now a pretty wide advanced stats gulf between him and booker, booker still well below replacement   there's also a phenomenon with zach, if you peruse the team subreddits you will see the most insane trade ideas for him -  nuggets fans think that he's worth gary harris and will barton, in the sixers subreddit they're offering tobias harris, and in the knicks sub they think overpay is ntilikina, knox, bullock and a mavs pick"
"well all of those players were doodoo-tier players before thibs got there, and some still are but he's found some way to limit the amount of damage they do   kevin knox was an abomination of a basketball player last year, but now thibs shackles him to the corner and he can stay on the court  randle been around the block too and no one else has really gotten him to be an impactful player   look at the other team nepotism coach, mike malone, also unable to define any roles for his players, has will barton and gary harris out there putting up unseemly efficiency numbers, barton near bottom of the league in just about every advanced stat 2/3 last years and led the team in minutes last year, forcing jerami grant to move elsewhere for reasonable minutes"
Read that as Will Barton at first lol
"They have 4 intriguing young players + White and Poeltl who look like solid role players.   Dejounte Murray - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Lonnie Walker - Secondary Ball Handler, Helper  Devin Vassell - Stationary Shooter, Wing Stopper  Keldon Johnson - Athletic Finisher, Helper  Jakob Poeltl - Roll + Cut Big, Anchor Big  Derrick White - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Murray, Vassell, Johnson, and Poeltl look like surefire starters. The question then becomes between Lonnie Walker or Derrick White as a starter and whether you want to use Walker off the bench as a bucket gettor like Tim Hardaway has been at times or Will Barton is for the Nuggets, or you want to use Derrick White off the bench to run your offense like Marcus Smart does for the Celtics.   Johnson is intriguing from the standpoint that he might be able to play some small-ball 5 in the future with how strong he is ala a PJ Tucker. Poeltl is really good for a center, but drop coverage becomes untenable in the playoffs, and you have to be able to switch 1-5. That's why it's not crazy that in the future they could close with Murray-White-Walker-Vassell-Johnson."

\*Gerald Wallace  We traded Will Barton for Gerald Henderson
"Barton in particular. Gary has still been great on D and has been much better on offense this year so far.  Will just fell off a cliff, which is weird because he's fighting for a starting spot and has typically overperformed when he's pushed to the bench.  It wouod be one thing if he was staying front of his man but dude looks like he's on skates out there, I don't even think he's a defensive upgrade over MPJ anymore because at least MPJ might get the rebound after he lets his guy get a clean shot off."
Will Barton aka the dub killa
Will Barton.  Kills us.
Reason being we are thinking long term. However I don't think this team will ever win a chip unless porter literally becomes a 20 + ppg scorer and RJ Hampton justifies his highschool hype.  I would have done the trade for Jamal + Barton+ Hampton and picks
Wasn’t will Barton really good for you guys last year? You think he lost a step?   I feel like bare minimum you just gotta get a backup for Jokic maybe one that’s defensive minded that can give him a break
"We have 30+ million tied up in Gary Harris and will Barton. We might be able to get off of Barton’s contract for some team in need of a secondary ball handler or someone to lead the second unit, but I don’t think we will be able to find someone willing to take on 19 million for Gary Harris."
Would you like a Gary Harris or will Barton?
"Some things need to change very soon for Denver,i hope they will figure it out because its making me mad how trash some players are..Barton who is like 6'6 missed 3 or 4 layups man.."
Gary Harris and Will Barton are the death of this team
"5 players are the same in both lists -  Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Derrick White.  There are precisely 3 SF's (who aren't mixed-SG/SF-wings) in each of the lists:  1. Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, Royce O'Neale 2. Aaron Gordon, Mikal Bridges, Trevor Ariza  Hardly a big difference, especially with half of the lists overlapping. And these are the players in 2019-20 who guarded [Lillard](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) (1.) the greatest number of minutes and who guarded [Luka](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629029/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense) the greatest number of minutes (2.).  This is also far from your claim that ""he's \[Luka\] almost always got a SF on him"". Indeed no more than Dame does.  \-----------------  Looking at the reverse scenario, who Lillard and Luka guard, it's a similar story. Of their respective top-15 defensive assignments in 2019-20, Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens.  You can read much more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k75cyg/is_this_an_accurate_list_of_the_consensus_top_5/gep0mjf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \----------------  In short, neither of your defence-based arguments is particularly well backed by data. And as long as [Rick Carlisle says](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115706/how-rick-carlisle-learned-stop-worrying-love-luka-doncic) Luka's his PG, he's a PG."
Same for us but with Will Barton lol
Not at this point. He's will Barton with better defence rn
I'll give you one lightly used Will Barton.
"Levert isn’t all that great. There are so many of him in the league. Empty calorie mid-range jump shooters that are just average from three, don’t get to the rim, and don’t play defense. Jeremy Lamb, Rudy Gay, Will Barton, Evan Fournier, Jordan Clarkson, Dillon Brooks, Malik Beasley, etc, etc."

"The thing is I doubt MPJ actually goes anywhere. He's an interesting trade piece but I don't think him combined with the less than ideal trade assets from Denver (Will Barton is alright but Gary Harris tanked his trade value) would get you anything close to Simmons.   Considering Denver's small market status and lack of real assets, the best thing they can hope for that MPJ turns into a star.  I wonder if they're in the trade mill for Oladipo though."
"You know how, not only that, the problem is that Jokic at 4 has an old Millsap and that makes it even harder for him. And at 3 young and inexperienced Porter and undersized Barton. Fortunately, there is now Green and for Play Off there will be plenty of Green with Jokic. Embiid is a monstrous defender, but Embiid also has Simmons, that makes easier for him. Jokic is faster now and i hope that one day he can be at least 80% of Marc Gasol. Not great but an solid defender."
Will Barton is everyone’s #1 supporter man. He was calling for MPJ to start last season knowing very well that he would take his starting spot lmao.
"Yeah, he said Nikola is big, slow, and sweet :)  Will Barton has been Jokic's #1 supporter from the get."
"I believe the nickname came from Will Barton? Jokic is called Big Honey because a) he’s big, and b) his game is slow and sweet."
Well Will Barton gave him the nickname
Mavs bigs will give trouble to clippers but ibaka will help. Cauley Stein playing well too.   Ya Morris and Barton been shit but Barton can do more things when shot isn’t falling. Plus clippers bench is real bad rn and Lou Williams is trash rn
"Murray is playing with banged up elbow. MPJ is out for almost 3 weeks. Harris out for the last few games for personal reasons. Barton is playing like shit. Still, we could have easily been 9-3 instead of 6-6. That speaks volumes about how hard Jokic is carrying this team right now. I'm also confident things will settle down soon and we'll shoot up the standings as well cause Jokic is able to keep this up and others will be back or can only do better than this."
"Will barton took the foul when it was Jokic who committed it  And I know Jokic is a big contributor to this, but the Nuggets are **always** in the top 5 in assists as a team. Jokic is good, but he's never been the assist leader until this year. The past 5 seasons OKC with westbrook and the Lakers with LeBron haven't been top 5. Houston's only been up there once even with Pringles at the helm. Mavs haven't been up there with Luka and the best offensive statistically. Warriors were only up there twice with their bonkers teams.  They're the only team who's been there every year. Unless they're literally the best passing team we've seen this decade, it's odd.  Jokic gets favorable assists. Murray gets favorable assists. They all do"
warriors fans hate will barton
Seems like Will Barton always plays well against us. Will Barton and Terrence Ross would be in the starting lineup of players that go off against GS
"Will Barton, noted Warrior killer"
Will Barton upset about not getting the ball LMAO
"That’s fair. Mavs didn’t have their two best bigs against clips(no Powell and barely any KP).   So they choked a 3-1 lead cuz Jamal went off 2nd half of series. No one besides AD can guard jokic, everyone else is at his mercy every single time. Nuggets also get will Barton back who didn’t play in bubble.   And luka giving kawhi and Pg buckets the whole series with no KP. KP an extra 25 ppg, their best rebounder, and one of the best paint protectors in the league. Plus zubac and ibaka can’t guard in space especially when Kp doing stepbacks, face up, and he’s 3-4 inches taller.   I saw zubac defend bro he’s struggling out there lol. He can get a stop or two cuz ppl try to bully him instead of just doing a easy jump hook or (short) jumper. Porzingis jokic  boban and others were feasting like it was Thanksgiving"
I honestly can’t believe Will Barton is still in the NBA. I remember watching him miss dunks on the Trail Blazers back in like 2012 lol. Always seemed like that ‘just good enough’ player to me
you must really hate will barton
Why does every Nuggets fan suddenly hate Will Barton
Will Barton always goes off on the dubs.
"MPJ, Gary Harris, and Will Barton to make the contracts work. Probably need to be 2 or 3 1sts as well."
started him? played him more than 25mpg? *prioritized* him over will barton?  this is a hilarious exchange
"you people make it sound like he was the 4th option on the nuggets  he was playing 25mpg off the bench, behind will barton  there's a wide range of things ""leaving for a bigger role"" can mean between being benched by will barton and being the #1 option  that he chose detroit should tell you that he would have played literally anywhere else"
they sacrificed their depth to keep will barton happy
"the games have been close, but from what i can see, the nuggets cannot exacute in the clutch, just like this game with a minute to go down by 4 murray hosted a tough shot when will barton could not create anything or against, wile jokic was just standing at the top of the key or against the marvericks, up by one with 12 seconds on the clock jokic got the rebound after a harris miss, passed the ball to murray, murray decided to go iso and shot another tough fade away brick when jokic was open and asking for the ball. '  compare to last year he is alittle bit more consistent, but definetely nothing compare to bubble murray"
that's what happens when you let your defensive wings go for free to make sure will barton leads the team in minutes
"god what a strange game. The Nuggets need a lot of help holding leads. Their defense is lacking. Their offense is confusing with certain rotations. This is NOT a top 5 seed team despite what anyone says. Without the leadership of Jokic, this team is in a weird space.   Shoutout to Will Barton showing up. Murray looked great. Jokic is Jokic. No Harris but scratch that for no Irving.   What the fuck was that shot by Murray? Seriously? Come on.   On to the next game. This team needs a lot of more concentrated work on defensive rotations, not having anti-COVID-19 individuals on the team and some smarter shot selection. a blown 16 point lead. sure, they kept it close, but this shouldn’t have slipped away."
"Will Barton is a good defender, especially considering we force him play undersized at the 3 a lot."

"Yes I totally agree, they should definitely trade for Will Barton the great NBA player."
Will Barton and Monte Morris are most likely 15+ppg guys on other teams too.   Damn that Nuggets team was deep. Looking like what the Clippers were supposed to be lol.
2012 one was the best one Ive seen in a long time  Khris Middleton  Draymond Green  Tomas Satoransky  Will Barton  Jae Crowder  Kyle OQuinn  Quincy Acy  Darius Miller  Mike Scott
"Everyone keeps mentioning Murray... but fail to mention that it’ll be hard to have those bubble numbers playing next to an MVP, and a rising offensive threat who keeps improving in Porter jr...   Plus we got Will Barton who kind of take shots away from them as well"
"No disrespect but I got will Barton. I know it might sound crazy. But when will Barton turns the corner in these next few years, I don’t want to hear shit about how everyone’s surprised."
"Being closer to the rim is the strongest predictor of rebounds. You can track it yourself here: [https://www.nba.com/stats/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&amp;dir=1](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/rebounding/?sort=REB&amp;dir=1)  Out of all starting guards in the league, the only ones with a closer rebound distance than Westbrook are Luka Doncic (who is realistically a forward who tends to guard 3s) and Will Barton (same).  Contrast other point guards who are considered to be strong rebounders like Curry, Lowry and LaMelo and you'll find they all get their rebounds from 7 feet or beyond.   I don't doubt that Westbrook is an elite rebounder - he has the technique and the motor for it. You can watch any Westbrook games and you'll notice it. But you also need to admit that he achieves this by defending closer to the rim."
"Should be fun. I just remember us matchup hunting mpj and bringing millsap + jokic outside of the paint for easy pickings in the paint.   Are barton + gordon + mcgee pushing the needle further than jeremi grant + plumlee + gary harris did? Arguably yeah, but will they stop matchup hunting + dennis' penetration + new laker offense? Idk, they might but can malone devise that gameplan?   It's 2 new and improved offenses and defenses, so at the very least it should be fun"
"Gordon is statistically the best defender on lebron since he (AG) joined the league   Jokic is much better than he was last year and they don’t have anyone to stop him  MPJ has improved defensively and offensively compared to last year  Barton is there now, he’s inconsistent but when he’s hot he’s much better than any of the Lakers role players   Murray has been playing at an all star level for the past 2 months or so, they don’t need to be bubble Murray but they’ll be good if he continues to be a good two way player  The Lakers don’t have any shooting and their best player is 36  The Lakers will be lucky to win a game, much less a series against the new Nuggets  **Unless the referees have something to say about it.**"
"Fine, call him a 2.   Jrue. FVV. Jaylen. Jimmy. Danny Green. Whichever guy the Pacers are starting at the 2--is it Holiday now? Josh Richardson. Will Barton. Rozier. Derrick White. Lonzo. That's 13.   Sterling Brown, if you count him as the Rockets 2. I could probably argue Wiggins and Josh Jackson, too.   Depending on which guy you consider a team's 2, the list changes. If you want to go just ""wings"" in general, it's even harder for me to consider him in that top-24 (because so many of the worst defenders in the league are starting 2s)"
"Yeah KD for Bol Bol and Will Barton sounds cool. Nice stretch 4 off the bench, reminds me of lamar odom"
TIL Marcus Smart is the Will Barton of the Celtics
"Will Barton for sure. The funniest part is that our play-by-play commentator always gets super salty about it and talks about how he's ""1st team all-Warriors opponent"" at least once a game lol"
"AG's not gonna guard Dame, and if he guards CJ that's not the kind of player he's best suited for chasing some quick guard around a million screens. Neither team will be able to stop the other if they play tbh, Barton or Murray on Dame isnt gonna work and I dont think youll see the best version of AG in a McCollu matchup. Inevitably IMO youre seeing the annual overreacting to a team that makes a deadline move(last yr it was the Pocket Rockets). Denver is still better, but Im not worried about Portland's offense in that matchup and Denver is a more tolerable matchup for Portland's bigs than other teams. Port can also get away with playing Powell/CJ/Dame easier than vs some other matchups"
Depends on what murray and will barton we get game 2 and 3 last year where legit trash by us I was ready to rally behind the fire malone movement because everybody else other than jokic was legit ass those games then murray went nuclear and jokic did what he did. Covert is honestly not that good at guarding jokic on the post and you can see that on how they have defended them this year if jokic mantains his shooting they are going to have gobert outside the paint which weakens their defense. Mpj is also a completely different player he is now a knockdown shooter and plays well to his roll. The problem for us is going to be our defense since we struggle against perimeter threats. I have to see more aaron gordon to see how much we improve on that side
Will Barton
"Nuggets didn't have Will Barton either, and when he's on we're unstoppable."
"That's okay, I'll that the L and sleep well tonight with the Nuggets win.  Will The Thrill: Great role player, catch and shoot, able to help run the offense, solid defense.  Billy Barton: Misses easy layups, rookie mistakes, constant turnovers, tunnel vision, ball hog.  We got Will The Thrill tonight."
Dude could have had an easy triple double. Yet he still boxes out like he is supposed to and lets Will Barton or Michael Porter get the easy rebound. Dude refuses to stat pad
Yea but the question was jrue or Ben not Ben or will Barton
"&gt;Who tf is guarding Jokic?   Tyson Chandler, JaVale McGee, and Zubac. Lol.  &gt;who had one of the best playoffs that year?   You do understand who LeBron James is right? And you know this would be exactly one year after his legendary 2018 run?  &gt;Who tf is guarding Murray who averaged 24 that playoffs?  Lonzo/KCP/Rondo  &gt;Prime Gary Harris? A decent Millsap? Prime Will Barton?  Aight."
Derozan and will Barton or Winslow in the off-season. Even though Barton would probably get a better offer somewhere else.
"Will Barton catching a stray here - he just said he thinks he's proven that he's a starter in this league, which I completely understand. Ultimately it's up to the coach to make the decision on who starts"
"of course lmao it's just that, you know, you'd think you'd kind of realize you aren't that dude on the court at the end of the day. he can enjoy living one of the best life setups a person could have, but he also should probably realize he isn't a star, at all. it reminds me of Will Barton saying he's too good to be a sixth man lol"
"Fuck that, man really mentioned Will Barton"
These new nuggets line up has some nice size. And all of them can ball. Going to be a scary team in playoffs.  &amp;#x200B;  Jamal Murray 6'3  Will Barton 6'6  Aaron Gordon 6'9  Michael Porter Jr 6'10  Nikola Jokic 6'11
LOL. We make fun of Will Barton.
will barton is an entertaining watch
"Will Barton, king of irrational confidence"
The should rename the roller coaster at Elitch's the Will Barton
Will Barton can't make a layup to save himself lately
Will Barton - uggggh
Imagine if the nuggets had a health gary harris instead of will Barton. Oh what could have been...
Will Barton is an extremely low IQ player....YIKES!
Put Will Barton in a missile and shoot him into space
So tired of dumb Will Barton. He would look so good in a Magic uni. Or a Guangdong Tiger uni.
Will Barton must think he's Zion with these drives... what's going through his head?  1. Drive directly towards the basket regardless of the number of defenders in the lane 2. ??? 3. Try and dump it ti MPJ
So Will Barton having a rough first half might mean a good second?
* Will Barton should be an All-Star even when disregarding offense because of his defensive impact ('20) - this one has to be the worst because it was actually upvoted * Jokic is a stat-padder * AD doesn't contribute to winning basketball * A worrying number of people saying they would rather have Brad Stevens than the #1 pick in the draft * Lu Dort &gt; Trae Young - another upvoted one
"MPJ played maybe 20-30 games of real basketball between highschool and the bubble. In playoffs he was a kid that often looked lost on the floor. Now he's a much improved player that keeps on improving.   Grant was a loss but AG brings everything Grant had and then some. Even more athletic, much better rebounder. Grant can be a better player than AG if they're asked to be a focal point on offense, but AG never has to be that in Denver, he'll be 4th or 5th option there, perfect role player.  Barton was injured and didn't even play in the bubble at all and now, thanks to having AG, he can slide to his natural SG position and help our defense a lot with his length.  Jokic took another jump in his game and in the best shape of his life.  I listed 4 important improvements that Denver will have compared to the last years playoff. And we'll also have 2 veteran wings in Millsap and Green to throw in from the bench when needed and Javale to cover for Jokic when he needs to rest."
"Nuggets gonna make their own album this year.   JaVale McGee aka [Pierre](https://youtu.be/Y89lvA-LrfE) with the production. Aaron Gordon aka [Aaron Gordon](https://youtu.be/8iD9clrWhUs) got bars, and of course the OG Will Barton aka [THRILL](https://youtu.be/TNaJRsguFqE) bringing it.   Nugget, Nuggets, Nugget, Nuggets, and Nuggets because we spit hit fire."
Will Barton
Lmfao who cares who you haven't done it to? What does it help to talk shit about Will Barton? Does it make you feel better?
Jesus Christ you’re a fuckin moron. Smart has one of the best plus minus every year. Will Barton has one of the worst.
"I feel like you are over simplifying something that is super complicated.    Better to not try to compare individual players.  The obvious place to start is AD+Bron versus Jokic+Murray, start with the stars.  Edge Lakers there for sure, but not by much, especially with the Lakers being banged up.  But when you start adding the rest of the pieces I think it swings Nuggets, MPJ+Gordon+Barton versus KCP+Dennis+Andre is very very Nuggets favored.    Is the gap between AD+Bron (assuming 100%) and Jokic+Murray bigger than the gap between MPJ+Gordon+Barton over KCP+Schroder+Drummond?  Pretty hard argument to make, imo.  And again, that is assuming the Lakers get back to 100%.    That is just straight up starters of course.  From what we have seen from the two teams benches the total package has to skew Lakers, the Nuggets second unit has been a gaping wound all year long(one that we hope will be sutured by JaVale and getting Morris back)."
I will always defend a good role player who fills a role we need. If we reacted to everything The way Barton haters do then they would call half our team trash. These also are same people that think PJ dozier should start over Barton lol.
Fartin Will Barton or Smart huh? Dunno about their IQs but I know who I'd want taking the shot when it matters
"I mean Gary Harris was injured a fair bit, and Will Barton was missed end of last season."
"Absolutely better than last year. I’ll start with Grant. In the pre covid part of the season Grant was a 6th man for us. He was streaky on offense and inconsistent on defense. He continued to develop and earned his minutes as the season went on eventually leading to his outstanding defense in the WCF against Lebron. That’s what non-Nuggets fans saw and thought that’s the player he always is. AG is a better player than Grant for our team, no question about it. MPJ is being ignored by a lot of people, in the last two weeks this man is putting up elite numbers, crashing the boards, and playing strong defense. AG opened up the floor for MPJ and since his arrival MPJ looks like a superstar. Eons ahead of where he was in the bubble. Gary Harris is a Nuggs legend, but he has been off the court so much with injuries these last two seasons and his offense had taken a nose dive. The team was clearly better defensively with him on the floor but our offense was still stagnate. Our guard defense was never bad though without him. Our wing defense was horrendous though which is where the addition of AG elevates the entire team. There’s less need for guys to come off their man or out of their zone to help the wing defender which is what was freeing up so much offense for our opponents. The last thing is the depth of this team now. With a healthy Monte Morris we have two starting caliber guards to pick from as a 6th man. Our second unit will be Monte/Barton, Dozier/Facu, Milsap, Green, McGee with some fluidity in the positions they play. Behind them you have effective guys like Nnaji, Gary Clark, and potentially Bol and Cancar. Idk if it will be enough to take on Brooklyn, but two weeks ago I would have thought we stood no chance against them. I personally felt we over performed on the bubble and that was enough to get us to where we got. This team is much better than last years and if Mal can put up 75% of what he did in the bubble and the team stays healthy, we can win it all."
This has Will Barton written all over it
"I just can't believe how many times Barton will drive, get the whole defense to collapse on him, then pass up 4 open teammates for a missed shot in the paint. He airballed one of those from 5 feet out when everyone else had a better look than him."
"None of what you said is off base. Barton does have tendencies that could potentially effect the team in a negative way, but they are beyond over blown by people like you and it’s becoming difficult to ignore.   It’s sad that you feel the need to shit on the guy publicly even after a solid game. It’s sad that you start a comment about a guy that just contributed to one of the most fun wins of the year with “Fuck Will Barton!”  It’s childish and tedious. There are ways of expressing your concerns that don’t involve this level of hate.  Stop being wet fucking blanket and enjoy the ride."
That is why I’m frustrated. Barton takes shots that MPJ is taking. With his jump shot him getting more shots than Barton is best for the team.   I’m sorry I’m looking with the long view and this shit from Barton is unacceptable cos he has a habit of this and shot will cost you later in the playoffs.   The whole team is kind of in flow state but Barton really go to 2 extremes and it fucks with everything.
Fuck will Barton! MPJ is open and even jokic is like give it to him but Barton completely ignored MPJ ( which happens a lot).  This guy has a lot of rope with Malone and can do dumb things without any repurcussions. Shit is crazy!   He is not a bad player but he straight up thinks he is Kobe or some shit.
"Monte is defensively unplayable as a starter vs any team with a star point guard. There's literally no reason he should spend a single minute on the floor against Portland, Utah, San Antonio, Dallas, Phoenix, or the Warriors' starters in the playoffs. He would be picked on every single play. If you thought Dmitch murdered our defense last year, he would do Monte way worse. The fact of the matter is that Will Barton was our second best player in the regular season last year before his injury, and even though he came back rusty he still has been a huge positive for us. His offensive mistakes do look very dumb when they happen, but if you look at his play hollistically, he is so important for our team. I love Monte as a second unit point guard because he's a killer and will torch second units with inexperienced defenders, but I don't think he should be playing many minutes with the starters with everyone healthy and Gordon on the team now. The only aspect in which he's better than Barton is his passing, but Barton is still a good passer."
The Will Barton fan
"Barton is definitely starting to look back to his old self, and playing in-position is helping with that. He may waste the odd possession with his relatively inefficient ISO plays, but he's really everything we need otherwise. Good defender, enough of an offensive threat at every range, good at moving the ball and making the second pass, and genuinely plays hard. Nuggets fans act like we'd be better off waving him because they saw him play bad in some of the horrible lineups we were using at the start of the season, but he's genuinely great for us. Especially now that his role within our starting lineup that feels more defined as being that energetic guard that you can't ignore while our more fundamental offensive pieces run their plays. If defenses ignore him or match him up with an inexperienced defender, he's going to find a way to get open and any of Jokic, Murray, or Gordon will find him. On defense he's still our best guard defender."
FUCK YOU WILL BARTON
Will the Thrill giveth and Will Barton taketh away
Trust me if you ask nuggets fans most of them will say Barton takes bad shots and can be pretty selfish sometimes. Gordon is just better overall
"Will Barton thinks an ""innuendo"" is an Italian suppository."
"Eh will Barton is going off tonight but typically isnt as dominant. Barton can have very off or on nights, while Gordon will be a consistent fourth option"
"Came to see the stars in Jokic, Leonard, George, Murray - and we get Will Barton and Reggi Jackson shows"
Why does Reggie Miller keep saying Gordon is the fourth option as if Will Barton isn’t clearly a better scorer??
"It’s pretty obvious you don’t watch the nuggets or Timberwolves. Jokic didn’t “carry” his team to the playoffs until 2019 when the nuggets had a starting lineup of Jokic, Gary Harris, Jamal Murray, Paul Millsap, and Will Barton. If that’s a poor supporting cast then then I don’t want to know what the Timberwolves roster is. Also you said Kat was not a leader because he was the second best player on the team when they made it to the playoffs. That was KAT’s third year in the league, when Jokic was in his third year, the nuggets didn’t even make it to the playoffs. Why don’t you hold Jokic to the same standard as KAT, if he’s on such a different level skill wise, shouldn’t he have been able to bring his team to the playoffs even if they were poor?"
"&gt;Jokic's health alone doesn't surpass the impact (on both sides of the court) of Jo. That's a very weak and uncompelling arg, imo.  It's not a weak argument, as sad as it is, he's on the court for a longer time, and is able to do more.  Also jokic is the best passer in the league, he is having one of the best offensive seasons of all time breaking multiple records. You can argue two way play Is more important but I'll argue that it's easier to build a strong defence around a weak defender than to build a near all time great offensive system using someone as Jokic.  Anyways I was only talking about MVP voting and the VOTERS factor in health, no one gives a shit what you think or what your opinion is  &gt;The Sixers are 8-8 without Embiid, thanks to the recent winning streak post-All Star break, with most wins in that timespan coming against nad competition  Literally just watch one nuggets game when Jokic is off the floor. This team cannot create offense for shit when Jokic is gone and it's just will Barton and Jamal Murray is, we aren't winning more than 3 games lmfao. You're a PLAYOFF team without Embiid. We are a LOTTERY team without Jokic. You can talk all you want about two way play but Jokic impacts winning games much more on a regular basis. We are steadily climbing the standings and the season isn't even over yet so calm down."
He's going to be our next Will Barton :(

Will 'Leeroy Jenkins' Barton
Will Barton went 0/7 in the same game with 33 minutes.
Why is Will “Dumbest Player In The NBA” Barton still in the game?
"Sixers can absolutely come back from this. Fuck will barton, absolute waste of space on a basketball court"
Will Barton should not be handling the ball. Give it to Jamal Murray.
Will Barton looks like a comedic actor  Chris Rock type of look
"Doesn’t get light contact called for him on one side, so then he goes and smacks Will Barton in the face?"
"will barton looks underfed, jokic should hook him up"

Will Barton cannot finish jesus
"&gt;1) Will Barton is ass. Beasley is significantly better.  Except he's a significantly better playmaker and defender than Beasley   &gt;2) Jamal is super inconsistent, and Jokic has had to win so many games in spite of him.  KAT played 2/3 games with D'lo this year....   &gt;3) MPJ is marginally better than Ant is right now.  A lot better.   &gt;Sure Nugs have a better supporting cast, but not nearly enough to account for the difference in offensive performance between the two teams.  D'lo missed 20 games,KAT missed 20 games,Beasley was suspended for 12. Do you not see the context behind our record? And we had Ryan Saunders as coach for the first 30 games of the season."
"1) Will Barton is ass. Beasley is significantly better.  2) Jamal is super inconsistent, and Jokic has had to win so many games in spite of him.  3) MPJ is marginally better than Ant is right now.

"If you gave him Jamal Murray,MPJ and Will Barton our record would look a lot better..."
"&gt;Like I said literally the only thing Towns is better at on offense than Towns is shooting more 3s. Jokic is scoring 27 PPG on 65 TS%. Last season Towns scored 26.5 PPG on 64 TS%. He averaged the same amount of turnovers and almost half the assists of Jokic. You're ridiculous if you think shooting more 4 more 3s and scoring at overall slightly worse efficiency means that Towns is a better offensive player than Jokic.   You obviously don't watch KAT then if you don't think his impact on the perimeter doesn't have an effect to the game. Also he averaged those stats with Andrew Wiggins as his best teammate btw.  Jokic is having a real tough time carrying MPJ,Murray and Will Barton this season :("
The Will Barton experience
Let me present the one man who rule it all  #WILL BARTON
"Joe Harris 19m/year Will Barton 13m/year, JRich 12/year,"
"He won't be. Even if we lose both Barton and Green, and Milsap and McGee don't sign back with us, we will search for a backup C and give Zeke, who is actually the better shooter, and also a far better defender and has a far better understanding of our offense the minutes at 4. Hell, I'm fairly certain that Vlatko is ahead of him in the rotation at this point."
"This is a nasty team. Bench is also fine tho, jamychal green will barton monte morris facundo campazzo javale mcgee. Definitely winning the west."
"Best I can think of is look for what referees will call the game and adjust your game plan accordingly.   If you are big market team or have a young star that you want to push you don't have to do too much.   If you really want to win vs Denver make Barton their go to guy, he will start scoring and he will think he is in his ""Kobe"" mode and will eventually lose you the game."
"also MPJ is 6'11'' with long arms, Jokic is the same, Gordon is what 6'8''? will barton is 6'6''  got some real length"
Because you don't know if will barton will give you an efficient 18 points with passable defense or make you wonder how can an nba veteran bounce the ball of his feet and decide that yeah that drive into four defenders is the best possible course of action
Fuck off. Malone isn't that great of s coach we run a bunch of cuts and that's about it if jokic or murray don't have the ball it's always iso or a prayer to god. We barely run plays more complex than the pick and roll and this is noticeable come playoff time where it becomes the murray jokic show as they take turns just doing shit. Our defense is whole we genuinely don't have a defensive scheme and depend a lot on our individual defenser skills. His rotations aren't atrocious but there are many times you wonder why is will barton still playing when his defense is laughable and he hasn't done anything if value for the last ten minutes. Watch us in the playoffs and notice how it's only murray jokic pick and rolls and our lack of any other play is the reason mobile centers like ad where able to wreck our offenses easily
Will Barton is the most confusing player to me in the league.
"Problem with monte in the starting lineup is that he will get absolutely torched defensively by... well by every other current playoff team basically. It's game over against donovan, CP3, Schroeder, Dame, and the other teams will just switch us until they can punish him. I like the defensive balance of the starters with Barton far more, and there is more than enough offense"
"He's honestly not even a bad defender. He always plays really well in the first quarter too, he just will have 3-4 rather infuriating plays (i.e. turnovers, missed layups, etc.) that really piss off most Nuggets fans. In addition to that, in a team that kind of is built around ball movement and passing (because of Jokic), Barton has some questionable decision making, and will sometimes take contested shots instead of passing to an open guy."
"Barton would be perfect fit as Clarkson type player from the bench, i hope Monte slide in his place when he return, but i doubt Malone will move him out of starters."
"Jamaal Murray, MPJ, Aaron Gordon, Jokic, and Will Barton   Outside of the Brooklyn Nets MPJ/Gordon/Barton might be the best 3-5 in the league, tbh.  Barton is criminally underrated just because he's been in Denver for so long but he understands their system like the back of his hand.   MPJ is just absolutely DISGUSTING and AG is about to blow up."
Will Barton is our shooting guard.
"Dude needs to be playing when Jokic isn't on the court. Terrible chemistry, and will barton is a 6th man scorer when the starters are out."
We booed Will Barton off the court in a playoff game in 2018  But it's really just him getting constant (mostly) undeserved shit
"True. Barton is an excellent player to have as long as he does not have a will Barton moment and decides it’s Will Barton iso time which are pretty inefficient overall. But the thing is he has these Will Barton moments 4-5 times a game. I don’t even blame him for these moments, I blame the coach for not stepping in and stopping these nothing possessions. P.J Dozier is another prime candidate for these kind of things"
Thoughts from someone who has now watched 2 whole Denver Nuggets games this season:   Aaron Gordon looked like he fit in seamlessly with the team. Made a lot of good decisions on offense.   Will Barton looked...not great. He seems like he's just trying to move way too fast all the time. He fumbled the ball quite a bit and didn't make great decisions offensively.   Jokic looked like the clear best player on the court and it wasn't even close. Incredible player.   Hawks were a mess. Trae Young did not look great.
"I mean, what are we supposed to do really?  Our second best player is injured as well as Monty Morris and Will Barton whom are important contributors.. If Campazzo and Howard get ""exposed"" in the Playoffs then it's what it os given the options, not much else could be done at the moment."
Will Barton won't be back for the first round sadly
I would say James Johnson but I highly doubt he want to comeback to Minnesota. Maybe guys like Otto Porter or Will Barton?
Will barton
Will Barton
"I love superstars like Steph, Lebron, KD, Dame, etc., but my favorite players are never those guys.  The players I've had the most joy in watching in the last decade are guys who weren't (\*yet\* in some cases) even very good:   **Rookie Giannis**\--I watched every Bucks game just because he was liable to do sth I'd never seen at any given moment.   **Jonathan Isaac**\--just iso watching him on D is more exciting than most things on TV.   **Chris Bouchet**\--he weird. Trebuchet 3 shooter/shot blocker/stringbean.   **Tyrese Halliburton**\--not ""exciting"" like some of the others, but watching him figure out what's happening on the floor faster than the vets all around him is pretty amazing.   **Will Barton**\--all knees and elbows and ill-advised shots, with a nose for the ball off the glass and a love of leaping before he looks.   **LaMelo Ball**\--he does stuff nobody else does and it's freaky watching him sus out plays ahead of everyone else on the court."
"The outcome depends on weather Monte, Will Barton and PJ Dozier return to the series. Also depends on weather Dwight Powell shows up to play. That dude can light up. I don't doubt about Luka and Joker showing up."
"I think the Will Barton trade is easily defensible, Afflalo would have been amazing off the bench for that playoff run."
Who's stopping Jokić over a seven game series? Willie Cauley-stein? Dwight Powell? Boban? Jokic would feast.   Nuggets at least have a few decent wing defenders in Aaron Gordon and Will Barton who can try to slow down Luka.   I think nuggets win this in five.
"Ahh yes, another young talented player the blazers buried on the bench instead of carving out playing time for,  only to trade them so they can blossom elsewhere.   Drazen Petrovic, Jermaine O'Neal, Will Barton.  And just now Gary Trent (hilariously the blazers drafted and traded both Gary Trents), although this trade is most defensible of the bunch and at least we got Stormin Norman for the rest of the season."
"Barton said he thinks he'll be back in the playoffs.   But.... this is also a dude who consistently says he's about to return and then doesn't. He always believes and tells fans and the press that he's closer to 100% than he is. He's just being optimistic and keeping that competitive spirit. Murray does the same stuff, I bet this offseason Jamal will be telling people he's aiming for opening day next year."
Will Barton
Morris is back. He will be getting more time.  Not sure if Barton will be back.  SO its looking pretty good for the playoffs. The rotations will be a lot shorter if he can get these guys rested up without losing to much mo and win more than we lose down the stretch.
So huge.   People focus on the Murray injury not realizing how many other significant injuries we’ve had or still have  Aaron Gordon Monte morris Will barton PJ dozier  Even millsap missed a game or two.
Fitz is notoriously annoying about random players in the league. He'll just randomly go off on Will Barton or some shit like what...?
Will Barton hates Golden State   Patty Mills too
"Bro I dont give a fuck about the age😂their circumstances at 22 are completely different. MPJ was getting less shot attempts than fucking Will Barton dude. But since he became a second option he’s averaging 25 on insane efficiency. So just imagine if he was a shot creator too, he would average 32 a game and this wouldn’t even be a conversation. We’re talking about POTENTIAL. Obviously MPJ has stuff to work on"
"Getting spoon fed? Jokic, Murray, and fucking will Barton had more shot attempts than MPJ...  Since Murray went out he’s averaging 25 on insane efficiency because this is the first time he’s been given the green light. He’s not in a system where he can just throw up shots all game every game"
"You might want to look at the Nuggets injuries the second half of the season... it's really only been Jokic and MPJ. 90% of their guards are injured and their basically signing guys off the street to play significant minutes. Will Barton, PJ Dozier, Monte Morris and Jamal Murray have all been gone. Campazzo is literally their third best player now and I'm not even exaggerating. He's even out playing Gordon( who also missed time)"
"Monte will likely be back by playoffs, no clue on Barton."
"Monte and PJ are comming before the playoff. Barton might come, but I think that he will miss the first round."
"The Nuggets also have Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Paul Milsap, Will Barton, Monte Morris, Javale McGee, and Jamal Murray (for half of the year).     The Warriors 4th and 5th guys rotate between Mychal Mulder, Juan Toscano Anderson, and Kent Bazemore. Not taking away from Jokic having an incredible year, but when you’re talking about their team records you’ve gotta see that there’s a pretty massive talent difference between the two teams lol."
So we’re just gonna pretend he hasn’t had murray for most of the year? How about porter? Will Barton? Aaron Gordon? Warriors are giving two way guys 30 min a game lol.
"LeBron is a forward by position only. He’s really a point guard and the initiator of the offense. And so is DS.  The Lakers don’t have any offense initiators or shot creators right now. Caruso and THT are trying to fill that role but they really don’t have much playmaking ability. They’ve been like secondary or tertiary creators, they’re not primary creators.  That’s why LeBron/DS missing are waaay more major injuries than whatever the Nuggets are facing. Because Jokic can handle all the responsibilities of imitating the offense and creating for others. Meanwhile the Lakers literally have no one on the roster right now that can create for themselves or others.  And you’re being incredibly disingenuous calling Campazzo a useless rookie. He’s 30 years old and legitimately a good role player. He’s like Caruso-lite. Oh, and PJ Dozier played in that LAL game, he wasn’t hurt.  I’m just gonna stop arguin. Will Barton and Monte Morris are not more important than LeBron or DS dude. It’s insane I even have to debate that. The Nuggets actually have players to shoulder the offensive creator role too while the Lakers have no one to fill that role."
"I never said Harris or Barton don't count, but neither of them were going to play in the first 4 games. My point is that Utah was close to a sweep without Bogdanovic. Which they were.  Either way, it's a moot point. We'll see how Denver does this post season missing their second best offensive player. I'm sure you guys will go far...."
"My evaluation of some star players and their coaches:  Steve Kerr is only 55 years old. I hope he continues to coach and mentor a new Warriors dynasty with a future roster and remains with the franchise through Curry’s career and after. His contribution to the success of the Warriors and his motion offense are not given enough credit.   Luka &amp; Rick Carlisle will likely get a Championship somewhere down the line, and I hope Carlisle can continue to mentor this phenom down the road.   Giannis &amp; Coach Bud have high expectations this year, and I fear that if they don’t make the Finals this year, they may fire Bud  Dame Lillard and Terry Stotts are in the same predicament as Giannis &amp; Coach Bud.   Jokic and Malone are a great pairing and with Porter Jr. stepping up this year and taking a leap, and with Murray returning next season and hopefully Barton and Gordon, they are going to be a problem for the West. Their ball movement and chemistry over there is amazing."
Bojan's uncircumcised tip is a better player than Will Barton
Jamal will Barton Monte morris and??  Also we know jokic and campazzo are good ball handlers
"Yeah even with Murray, Dozier, Morris, and Barton all hurt you already know the counterjerk will be insane if we lose. Context doesn't matter for nephews."
"It’s disingenuous to point out the lakers without lebron while only mentioning Murray. Nuggets are down 5 guys. Only guards on their roster that arent out are facu-rookie, Markus Howard-rookie(3 mins per game) shaq Harrison(signed less than a month ago, and Austin rivers ( signed less than a month ago). They might be red hot because jokic is truly that good, but it was anything but a surprise. Using that game as a “it already happened” when we’re going to see Monte Morris, will Barton, and pj dozier come back for the playoffs isn’t fair to the nuggets depth at all"
You are sort of looking at it too narrow though. Not taking into account all the details.   Jokic this year has had the following:  -Gary Harris missing significant time while he was with the team  -A pretty big player turnover  -MPJ missing time due to Covid  -Monte Morris missing significant time with Hamstring injury then reaggravated it and missing probably til playoffs  -Murray coming in tired and battling minor injuries at the begging of the seasons   -Obviously ACL tear for Murray  -Barton Hamstring will miss significant time   And maybe something else Im missing.   Suns have so far been one of the healthiest teams in the league.
"Will Barton also got hurt, not sure how serious. Team is crazy deep"
"Yeah, sadly he's lost enough offensive options that Wilt's single season assist record as a center will probably stand now because his assist numbers have dropped off, but he's just been rattling off Embiid-esque 30/15 nights again and again since Barton went down as well."
"Malone is the big reason our guys keep staying motivated even with our 4 best guards injured. He menaged to bring 2 players to 10 days contract and integrate them flawlessly. We almost didn't feel losing Jamal, Monte and Barton, of course it will be harder in the playoffs. I don't think more than 3 teams in the league would be able to play on the same level without 2nd best player, started and best 6th man in the league, Jokic isn't some motivational speaker, this is mostly on Malone."
"Oh he will. He's now our starting shooting guard.  Let me remind you of how cursed this season has been: Murray out, Morris out, Barton out, Dozier out. Those were literally our top 4 guards right after we traded Harris"
"Nuggets also have players out lol in Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, and Will Barton, I dont think that's a valid excuse."
Will Barton is definitely funny coz they are mad at hi. Every game but when he doesn't play then they miss him
"It’s like this all the time. Any time Denver loses its because of either the refs, will Barton, or Murray not being 100%(before he went down)."
Will barton satin bomber jacket is FIRE
"This half has also demonstrated Facu's limitations as a point guard especially when the defense starts getting intense and handsy in a playoff setting. Murray will be sorely missed by the Nuggets come playoff time. Facu is a great energy guy and good pest-like defender, but as a point guard, he's not the answer. I wonder when Barton or Morris will return."
It really depends on which Will Barton we see in the playoffs.
Barton has starter spot written in his contract so if hes back this season he will start immediately ...and that might be bad for Nuggets . Having him off the bench would be better for team
"I'm obviously biased, but I think it's possible. Our offense is still really good, we have MVP that is MVP sololy because of his offense and MPJ who is just free buckets, it's not as good as with Murray, we have less weapons now, but I'm confident in Jokic and MPJ taking 50+ shots a game in the playoffs, if MPJ keeps shooting good our offense won't have a problem. On the other hand, our defense is better than with Murray and Barton, instead of them we have Facu and PJ, both of them are really good defenders. With starting lineup we now have the team is pretty balanced.   We will know if we are contenders after the next 4 games, we already had the great win against the Clippers, now we have to play Lakers, Jazz, Nets and Knicks. If we win 3 or more we are contenders, if we win less everything is possible but the chances are way slimmer. The team is already 9-1 after Jamal got hurt, with one loss being when Barton got hurt in the first minute of the game. I know that our team doesn't want to blame the loss on injury, but it obviously affected them. It's not like this team can't play without Jamal. We are all sad that he got hurt, but people are really underestimating the Nuggets without him, we are still a good team, in fact we are probably better than in the last year. MPJ is playing like an allstar now, Jokic is better than he was in the last season, AG can guard any wing, and Facu and Dozier (if he is focused) can defend almost any guard."
"Man imagine how bad the Mavs would look if Luka was having to carry some true scrubs like MPJ, Aaron Gordon, or Will Barton instead of this excellent team /s"
"Yes, Grant is good, and he'll be missed, especially on offense. I think AG is stronger than Grant and he'll focus mostly on defense. You can't write LeBron off, especially in the playoffs, but he is 36 and coming off an injury, so we'll see if he's fully healthy by then.   AD prefers playing a 4, so Jokic would most likely be guarded by Drummond and Gasol. They will for sure try to play physically and get Jokic frustrated. I think they won't be as effective as McGee and Howard last year. Drummond has all the physical tools but I think Jokic will dominate that matchup because of his skill. If AD decides to guard Jokic, that will make it tougher for Jokic, but Jokic needs to learn from his mistakes last year and not get too frustrated, and honestly, I'm not sure he's there yet.  The difference between the Nuggets last year and right now is that the second unit is very good defensively and not a liability at all. They have been increasing leads in the last few games even while Jokic was resting. That is a nightmare for any team playing the Nuggets. On paper, they don't look impressive, but they play really good as a team, and they have Morris and Barton coming back. I think the Nuggets have the best record in the league since the All Star break, and Murray missed a lot of time even before his ACL tear.  That being said, the Lakers have LeBron and AD and an experienced team, a great and for some reason underrated coach that can make adjustments easily, and they are still very hungry even after winning last year with relative ease."
That's fair. However I will say everytime we play Golden State some whack shit happens. The whole offense was just getting used to Murray being out then Barton got hurt right out of the gate. I'm taking that one with a grain of salt especially considering it was pretty much a blowout and he still got 19/6/6.
"I get the “lol.” It would’ve been a dumb “lol” if the Nuggets had a healthy team with Murray, Barton, and Morris. Without Murray, I still see the Lakers winning in 5, maybe 6. I still think AD and LeBron will turn it up come playoff time."
"It’s not just facu though. Its also PJ dozier getting run with the starters. It’s also Austin rivers and shaq Harrison. And it’s also the millsap/green pairing in the bench getting more comfortable.  It’s a lot of different things.  Go back and watch the handful of games after the Gordon trade before the Murray injury. One of the reasons we were so excited about this teams potential was because *both* ends of the floor were clicking. By moving thrill up to the 2 instead of having him play the 3, suddenly we were oversized with him, mpj, and Gordon on the wings. We were basically switching everything 1-4 and occasionally even switching with Jokic.  The players even talked about how much they loved the free flowing style on defense and how it also translated to the offensive end. This team has always played best when they are loose and having fun and that was a big part of it.  All of that went out the window with Murray’s injury because our replacement options at the time were Monte Morris and facu, who are both too short to do that with. Then Barton goes down. Dozier is long AF (and I would have been down for dozier-Barton after Murray’s injury, but Malone would never do that) and is a great defender for sure, but the switch everything plan is out the window as soon as facu is involved.  But what did happen is our guard depth was so thin that we brought in shaq Harrison and Austin rivers. Those guys have really bought into their roles as defense first guys. Our second unit has been mauling people defensively. We basically transitioned from a high powered dynamic offensive team to the grit n grind grizzlies where we just play at an even more glacial pace through Jokic, clamp down on D, and our second unit lives off of transition buckets from turnovers and whatever scraps we can get in the half court offense from Millsap, random buckets from MPJ when he’s staggered with that unit, or positive shooting variance from 3 from a group of somewhat unreliable 3 point shooters. Millsap and green are both fine catch and shoot 3 point threats, but there’s not really enough rim gravity or shot creation to get them open looks consistently. Both of them are pick and pop threats with no rollers really, so it’s rare for them to get open looks outside of defensive collapses. Javale plays minutes occasionally and he changes that a bit, but offensively the bench is still very limited.  Basically, the team identity has changed entirely and it’s really unfair to put all of that at Murray’s feet. We absolutely still miss him and will especially miss him in the 2 man game/3 man game (with Gordon) on offense. It really unlocked Gordon as a roll threat"
"If Barton and/or Morris come back before the play offs Austin Rivers is hopefully out of the rotation or at least on very low minutes. We will have Facu, PJ, Shaq, Monte and/or Barton which is good enough rotation. Edit: If Austin starts hitting shots I'm ok with him, that's the main problem with him now, he is been a plus overall."
"Lmao dumb ass, what about removing Jamal Murray(you know the one who made the clippers his bitches) will Barton and monte Morris. That's our top 3 guards fool and we won. We won with fully fit teams in the bubble(sans Barton) and we beat them with injuries to important players in our rotation. And u just assume almost everyone will take clippers lol. Like I said, delusional."
"He is, but the reason they’re 9-1 is because mpj is finally getting to show that he’s a superstar in this league, and will barton is a ballstopper, so him being out helps too"
"I sometimes think the Murray-jokic two man game became a bit of a crutch. It was effective but has a ceiling. Like losing Harris and Barton got the 2019 playoffs created the Murray-jokic chemistry, maybe losing Murray will force some growth in everyone. Not sure it’ll be enough this year, but if Murray comes back for the plays next year there are a lot of tools at the nuggets disposal"
That makes me sad. I loved Will The Thrill Barton when he was on the Trail Blazers.
Warroris and we lost Will Barton in that game.      Gonna request that we just forfeit every game against the Warriors from here on out and hope we never play them in the finals and maybe even then forfeit every road game.
He's much better than that walking mistake factory Will Barton. It's hilarious how those stupid idiots over at the Nuggets sub were all having a mental breakdown when Barton got injured. The idiots didn't realize it was a massive addition by subtraction. Dozier is a much better fit in the starting line up than Barton for a long list of reasons.
"We're down Jamal Murray, Will Barton, and Monte Morris. Who do you expect him to play? Also Shaq has been really good and we've won like 4 games in a row with guards we signed a week ago."
See I've been on the Will Barton dislike camp for a long time. I don't see why he keeps getting minutes on the court. Every time I watch him I feel like he make no meaningful contribution or is bricking a shot. Then I check and see that the advanced stats are atrocious. Does he have blackmail material on the coach and GM or something???
We also lost Will Barton in that one game. Chase Center is cursed.
Will the thrill Barton
Some of the Nuggets fans hates Will Barton
Is Will Barton injured? Is there a timeline for his return?
"These are all arguments I could make for Simmons as well, you're just being selective in your viewpoint.  &gt;But Jokic has been fine in the playoffs, his career playoff DTRG is 111 iirc which is league average.   Simmons' career ORTG is 110 which as you said is league average  &gt;He was especially good defensively in 2019, but it’s not like he was getting played off the court   Simmons has not been played off the court on offense. Also, I don't know that this is really true for Jokic as he actually did get subbed off a few times at the end of close games when the Nuggets were on defense. As an example, [game 4](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/202009240DEN.html) against the Lakers last year.  &gt;though that used to be a problem when he was younger. He has really developed into a solid and self-aware defender who is good at minimizing his weaknesses   I would say the same about Simmons on offense, the last time he was in the playoffs was two years ago when he was a second year player, he's developed since then. This year as you said will be telling, but I don't see the evidence for Simmons being more of a liability on offense than Jokic is for defense.  You can try blaming it on supporting cast but I'd argue Simmons' supporting cast on offense has been about as good as Jokic's on defense. Murray's a solid defender, Grant was really good, Harris was good, Barton is solid. Porter was a bad defender but he didn't play as much last year. In theory the Nuggets should've been an above average defensive team."
Will Barton had to pull his mask down to show his facial expression lol
Week 17 stats.  Jamal Murray | Will Barton | Michael Porter Jr. | Aaron Gordon | Nikola Jokic  Stats: 133.9 offensive rating | 100.0 defensive rating | +33.9 net rating | 90 minutes played  That was what could have been.  Get well Murray.
Will Barton is ass asf
"If I’m a moron for not understanding it then you’re a moron for not typing it right.   Will Barton is not good at all. He is ineffective as hell. MPJ is ballin and Gordon is alright, but he’s not a game changer. The problem with Denver is that you guys have a very good team, but there are 4 teams in the West who have a very very good team. Utah, Phoenix, and the two LA teams would all be favored over Denver in a 7 game series."
You're a moron if you couldn't understand that comment.   Denver didn't have Will Barton in the playoffs last year either. Jokic was already the best player in the series and he's even better this year. Denver basically added MPJ as a player since he wasn't good last year and also Will Barton and Aaron Gordon.
Denver is likely down both Murray and Barton with Monte also being a question mark. Nuggets can't do shit without those guys. Campazzo will get played of the floor and their other guards aren't exactly scoring threats either.
Will Barton is a rapper lmao
"Sure, it just took him 2.5 years to fully commit to Jokic ball that's a fact.   Tried to play defensive basketball with mostly offense players that's a fact drtg 27-30 for 3 straight seasons until finally Wilson Chandler got off the team and his pairing with Barton was finally stopped, also fact. Completely without offensive system in those seasons.  Side fact: Played Wilson Chandler 48 minute's scoring 0 point and -3, for winter takes playoffs spot on final game of the season.  Tried to play trough Millsap when he got to Denver, because Millsap was a ""star"". Fact.  Its ez to look nice when Jokic is nice, too bad Jokic cant play full 48 minutes to bail out coaching when Jokic needs to rest.   2nd half collapses like on the schedule also fact. Bench playing like g league is also there.   There are many negative facts about Malone some people just not want to acknowledge them, because hes a saint.   And Jokic asking to play from bench is biggest bullshit ever, even if Jokic asked Malone didn't had to do that knowing it will hurt the team performance.   Not to mention he tried to play trough Mudiay for more than 2 seasons when was obvious hes not even nba calibre player, fact.   I need more time to remember everything because i don't keep my scripts of generic ""Malone good"" notes to argue over online, i know hes bad coach hidden behind talent of his players, and that's not going to change.   No reason to target me on every post over reddit over my opinion, and even if im wrong its my right to be wrong."
"Will Barton and millsap, ignore my flair."
&gt; It’s okay to be wrong man.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/2892728/michael-porter-jr  Literally everyone lists him as a SF.  https://twitter.com/willthethrillb5/status/1291148557592997890?lang=en  Will Barton called him a SF not a PF... dont be ignorant
"They have will Barton listed as SF. Was he playing SF? Or shooting guard? That’s a very easy one. Wait but everyone talks about that injury adding to our guard problem? Could it be, in fact, that the listed position is wrong in many cases? Because I can find a dozen other sites listing Porter as PF.  Should we trust a draft profile to tell us what position he plays on a given night? Should we ignore all of Denver media including interviews with Malone and Porter talking about playing him at 4? Can’t watch any games then because it wouldn’t add up.  It’s okay to be wrong man."
"People keep saying there haven't been any more injuries this season than in prior seasons, but there seem to be an awful lot of soft tissue injuries, especially hamstring related (Dame, Harden, Will Barton just happened a few days ago against us).   In terms of big injuries, it feels like this season is not worse or much of an outlier in terms of other seasons, but I feel like there's been a lot more soft tissue stuff (like tendinopathy) with hamstrings, calves, etc. Would be interesting to see if this type of issue has been exacerbated by this season's condensed schedule, frenetic pace, and a short off-season for players who played in the bubble."
It’s good to know that God has his priorities straight looking out for Will Barton and his health. I was worried he was going to get distracted curing cancer in kids or solving starvation and droughts around the world .
"Naming Facu 'Spiderman' was pretty weird given that's Mitchell's thing but, that was Jamal, not the fanbase.  Jokic being nicknamed 'Big Honey' by Will Barton was pretty funny as well."
"You realize that MPJ and Jokic are basically the only plus shooters playing atm due to injuries right? Unless you want to include the incredibly streaky Green who also has a slow release. And Facu is the only true PG atm.  Teams have been crowding passing lanes and treating MPJ as the only player outside of Jokic and Barton worth guarding... and now Barton is hurt. Yet guess how many points MPJ put up tonight?  39 on 21 shots.  We will have to just agree to disagree in regards to Ingram. I agree the roster construction is extremely wonky. I agree he is talented. But everytime I watch the Pels (and they are on national TV a LOT), I see a low IQ player who is more comfortable with the ball in his hands, is prone to dribbling the ball too long and is prone to occassionally shooting ya'll out of games.  Somebody in this thread called him a rich mans Barton and that's actually apt af. I'm a huge Barton guy and think, when healthy, he is mad underrated. Unfortunately, he hasnt been able to stay healthy for a full season since that hip injury.  But guess what his typically shooting splits and stats are when healthy? 15/5/4 on 47/37/80.  The difference is that he is very comfortable being a 3rd or 4th option or playing multiple roles (i.e. he willingly adjusts his usage depending on his teammates). He knows he is a role player basically. And when healthy, is an elite 4th option who occasionally steps up as a 3rd option.   That said, he still occassionally takes on too large of a role for what his effecency dictates or fails to recognize when his shot is off. And it part of why he is so bad at playing hurt. He doesnt adjust his game.  BI can be a very good second option or an absolutely elite 3rd option. But too often, he insists on playing like a 1st option."
"I believe MPJ will step up. Also Malone is doing an extremely poor job integrating Gordon into the offense. Gordon could also provide some point production.  Also the Nuggets lost Murray's scoring but they gained Facu's defense. Facu needs to hit those open 3s though on a consistent basis.  It's too late now but if Malone had put Barton's entitled ass on the bench and gave PJ the same opportunities as Barton, the Nuggets would have been in a much better place today. PJ plays much better D, rebounds better, and is a hound going after loose balls compared to Barton.  Rivers could also provide some spark off the bench.  There are some positives but the Lakers and Mavs are just tough match ups. It's probably better for the Nuggets to slide to 7th or 8th and play the Suns or Jazz."
"Fuck no lmao!  The Nuggets have a better chance of getting back to the WCF if Barton stays injured for the rest of the season. Barton is a mistake-prone dumbass who thinks he's Kobe. His defense is overrated as well.  If Barton is healthy, Carlisle will annihilate Malone in a coaching battle. See what Carlisle did to the Lakers defense tonight. The Lakers even without LeBron are still a very good defensive team. Malone can only dream of coaching like Vogel on defense. Malone's problem is that he doesn't hold Barton accountable. Barton can commit 3 straight idiotic TOs and he'll stay on the floor."
"No way, I think this is a horrible trade. Ingram already has trouble in New Orleans taking touches away from Zion and needing the ball too much to be a secondary contributor, that would be even worse in Denver. Ingram plays more like mega Will Barton than proto-Klay imo, if I’m Denver definitely would rather have MPJ with the knowledge he’s a 3rd option when Murray is playing.  Also, given the Nuggets feelings on MPJ’s ceiling, trading him at any point this year would be a massive sell low. He’s going to add more value from development than you could get in a trade right now."
&gt; Fingers crossed he can be the best parts of Will Barton and Gary Harris  this is kind of insane.. but if he can develop he'll be good enough to be part of the main rotation with Jamal back.
"After Murray injury MPJ has 25 points/game with 58/55/83. Now without 3 players that can score (Murray, Barton and Morris) I bet his numbers will be even better"
Yo PJ finally getting the chance he always needed. Fingers crossed he can be the best parts of Will Barton and Gary Harris. These last 12 games are huge for him!
"Hold on , Will Barton is 30 years old? Where has he played all this time?"
Singer Will Barton? Didn't know he was multi talented.
"Even if Murray didn’t play like the level on the bubble he still would’ve played really well in the playoffs which we’ve seen for two years in a row and probably will average around 25 ppg if you balance out both of his playoffs performances. Also one of the most clutch players in the league. People don’t realize grant wasn’t that good before this year, AG now is a lot better than Grant last year. MPJ has improved significantly and isn’t a liability on D anymore and can shoot the lights out. Also we didn’t have Barton last playoffs and he can score 13 points on 5 mins, but be bad the rest of the game but still. Then jokic got better and more aggressive, MVP baby. Our starting lineup when healthy was like a +60 for a reason."
"We lose mal, monte next game and then barton tonight. At this point I'm not sure I give a fuck about this season much anymore. We have absolutely no dribble penetration now, our entire back court is wrecked and to make matters even worse our dumbass fanbase will blame Moach for our lack of scoring. This season went from fuck yeah to fuck you in 2 weeks I honestly just want the rest of our roster to get the hell out of this season uninjured, maybe some solid playoff minutes for the young guys and come back next year. I am so sick of seeing nuggets limping off the court."
If losing Murray didnt cost them games then Will Barton wont either.
"Man it's not a good feeling. I pretty much felt that way before the season started when Klay got hurt again. Hopefully Will Barton isn't hurt bad and can come back soon. Y'all have a chance to make some noise still with him, Jokic, and MPJ if they stay healthy."
Jamal and Will Barton out with injury
No other scoring options when Barton went down. I could see Jokic going ice cold to end the year because teams will just do that.
Second best players then were Jamal Murray and Jeremi Grant and they are both gone now. Even Will Barton and Monte Morris are down with injuries.
Denver Nuggets  Will Barton III (right hamstring strain) will not return.
I will give barton for any guard Mke has straight. Pick one
"Have you forgotten about Wiggins? Steph, Dray, Wiggins, Oubre, then Baze. That top 3 is honestly pretty solid, and Oubre has had some awesome games this year. He's a fine role player.   Assuming MPJ is the second best, who is the Nuggets 3rd best player right now? Aaron Gordon who is a very solid player, similar to Wiggins, maybe? After that though? It's a pretty fucking steep drop off. Like, Will Barton is good but not any better or worse than Oubre or Bazemore. They just bring different skills. He's a worse defender but he can handle the ball and pass a bit. Monte Morris is good, but again, just a role player like those dudes. The rosters are not as different as you make out without Jamal Murray."
"Nah, otherwise Will Barton would be MVP. Joker's consistent availability is the reason he's leading the MVP race by a wide margin.   Joker having a historically great season because of his ability to play basketball is the reason he is an MVP top candidate. The availability cements him as the frontrunner."
"Most people are blaming him for this inconsistency, but when you watch these games he goes long stretches without touching the ball.  This seems to be a recurring theme.  The Denver play calling seems to make it a point to emphasize other players and move away from MPJ.  His useage rate has dropped to 18.7 since the Murray injury when you would think his useage rate would skyrocket, but players like PJ Dozier (19.8), Will Barton (20.9), and Paul Milsap's (28.2) useage rates have surged even with incredibly low effective fg%s(45% compared to MPJ's 70%).  My theory is he isn't liked on the team by coaches and other players."
"I agree about the Barton/Jokic chemistry. Barton holds onto the ball waaaaaay too long, often leading to help defense or the original defender to get back in place. Barton also seems to lack vision to pass out of a drive for open threes and will settle for contested layups or turnovers. Honestly we should have Jok bringing it up every time at this point. Hopefully MPJ can move more off ball, he gets like a statue often just standing around without back cuts or great movement. Could be scheme, but I hear Hanson mention it all the time on Altitude."
"you do know lakers lost dwight green rondo mcgee right lol.  you got schroeder drummond and harrell, all suck in the playoffs or have no experience.  clippers got significantly better. nuggets got better with aaron gordon and will barton back  stop comparing previous seasons to current one you clown casual fan lmao"
Will Barton 2nd best Nugget by far rn :/
"Will ""I'm a starter in this league"" Barton"
"You can say that and it's fair but last year the Nuggets had some similar issues. Paul Millsap and MPJ were all but unplayable defensively in that series - JaMychal Green is much more mobile than Millsap and should be able to stay out there when Bojan is out there. MPJ's defense is night day different this year, he's not good there yet but he's much, much better defensively and improving by the game while also actually being integrated into the offense as a weapon (if he's fully integrated, there's no one on the Jazz that can guard him either). By the same token with the Conley thing, Gary Harris didnt come back in the playoffs until game 6. He missed the first 5 and his defensive presence was felt quite strongly by Mitchell and Conley both in games 6 and 7. No guarantee he plays if they match up a gain, but I think that's part of why Denver's held him out so long, they want to make sure Gary is healthy for the playoffs. Jamal Murray is also vastly improved on the defensive end too. PJ Dozier is better at dealing with guards than Jerami Grant was since... y'know, that's his actual position. Will Barton didnt play last year in the playoffs at all. He gets a lot of ire from Nuggets fans (including myself at times), but he's a good 2-way player when healthy and locked in. He defends decently/with good effort and length (and there's not really anyone on the Jazz save Bojan who can punish his slight build), and he can get to the rim and shoot. Both are different teams, and the Nuggets are a different team arguably moreso than the Jazz, they've just had some quite bad luck with injuries and a couple covid related absences.   I still maintain that despite all the differences in both teams, it will come down to if the Jazz can stop Murray and Jokic, and... I just dont think they can. We have a pretty clear trend now in the last what, 12 games they've played including the playoffs, Jokic dominates Gobert at this point, and Murray can get to whatever spot he wants (in this way too, Murray is harder to scheme against than Mitchell - both great players no doubt, and Mitchell is especially good if you let him get to the rim, but he's not quite as good of an outside or midrange shooter - and Murray's best skill is his ability to make difficult shots along with that 3 level ability... you can take 1 or even 2 areas away but it's extremely difficult to take away everything. Even Kawhi/PG/Pat Bev couldnt do it)"
"The nuggets players with the most minutes this season are Jokic, Murray, MPJ, Will Barton, Monte Morris. Jokic is a better defender than any of them."
"Yup, it’s why Denver has a long list of players leaving for more minutes/bigger roles.   Jusuf Nurkic Evan Fournier Trey Lyles Malik Beasley Jerami Grant Mason Plumlee  Will Barton will definitely be next."
Naw Hart will get minutes once out bigs come back. Joke needs some kind of rest and if we want to make a splash in the post season then we need to be able to put points on the board with bench. Our team should look completely different with all of our guys healthy. Our bench with facu/Barton/dozier/green/hart could be absolutely deadly in the post season
"I HATE WHEN WE PLAY AGAINST WILL ""THE THRILL"" BARTON"
"Would start Carmelo Anthony on your team, that's pretty much what Will Barton is this year."
But I mean have you watched Will Barton play?
"horrible take...  Firstly Jamal been playing very well in the last 20 games. Secondly, ""Will Barton is hurt, we really miss him in the playoffs"" to now he's the worst starter in the league.  Thirdly, PER is a horrible stat by itself when its not supplemented by anything, just pointing out PER and saying hey look they have low PER is weak. Mason Plumlee - 17.5 PER and Denver let him go??? BIG LOSS?? NO."
Will Barton is not the worst starter in the league.
"We lost jerami grant and torrey Craig mpj has been a disappointement and looks to be only good as scorer without any basketball iq,gary harris offensive decline has been a lot steeper than expected jamal murray has returned to his inconsistent self and will barton has forgotten how to play basketball"
&gt;This includes Will Barton (11 PER) who would be without a doubt the worst starter in the league as it currently stands.  No way that's true
What about Will Barton?
will barton doesn't exist?
It’s less about “analytics values 3s over dunks!” (because that’s absurd) and more about our **abysmal** coaching on transition plays.  We consistently struggle to finish routine 2 on 1s or 3 on 1s at the rim. MPJ also specifically said he is coached to go to the 3 pt line if he’s the first one down the court.  Hopefully this will be a catalyst to drill that shit because if I have to watch Murray and Barton fuck up a fast break together one more time I might off myself
People will blame MPJ but im blaming Barton trash ass 2 points he gives us nothing out there
I don't understand how will barton is basically a traffic cone on offense and defense but turns into Kobe against us.
well at least michael baloney has seemingly stopped playing will barton to close out games but losing 2 to the wizards is indefensible
"I know I’m in the minority here but I feel like the Nuggets with Giannis will be able to run opponents out of the gym. They gain so much athleticism here and teams already struggle playing in Denver. Denver’s defense gets better as well.  The Bucks would send Lopez to the bench and probably start Jokic, Portis, Middleton, donte, Jrue. Our defense gets so much worse. We are also slower and don’t gain that much more offense than we already have with our current team. I say this all as a huge Jokic fan and I hope he gets the MVP this year but Giannis is the better more impactful player overall. I’d see Denver starting Giannis, Porter jr,/green, Barton, Murray, Morris. Or Gary Harris at the 2 and Murray at the 1. That’s a good combination of defense and scoring."
"He’s ahead in a metric - team record - that we both just explicitly agreed is the most fluid of any of the factors relevant to the MVP race.  So why are we bringing up team record with 40+ games left to play?  Or at the very least, why frame in the condescending, static manner that you did?   Which is more likely? * nuggets get to the 4-5 seed * nuggets stay at the 7 seed * nuggets fall to the 9 seed   Because when you say shit like “lmao they ain’t givin mvp to the 7 seed fam” or “lol he’s only a game and half out of the play-in game” you’re saying that you think scenarios 2 and 3 are more likely than scenario 1.  You’re entitled to that opinion, but I would disagree. I do think this current version of the nuggets has some flaws that the teams the previous two years (when Denver was the 2 and 3 seed, respectively) didn’t have. But this team also has a much higher ceiling along with that lower floor.  It’s just a much higher variance team, trying to integrate MPJ who is still learning, trying to integrate 3 rookies other than MPJ (facu, rj hampton, zeke nnaji - and that’s not even including bol bol who probably doesn’t factor in this year), trying to deal with a plethora of injuries to their wings (Harris, Barton, dozier) and their bigs (Millsap, green, and Whittington) and stitching together lineups that work.  I’m inclined to believe they will figure it out and land somewhere around the 4-5 seed than 7-9. And if that’s the case with the crazy impact numbers Jokic has had, I’m not sure how you hold that against him."
"I think Barton and Campazzo took some bad shots. I prefer watching them when they share the ball and get everyone involved - you know, the Jokic triple double-type game. But damnit we need wins and that was winning basketball. The good thing is they can play different styles depending on the opponent. The bad thing is I'm not loving the execution of those other styles. The 3-12 guys are really not consistent and haven't figured out how they fit together yet. Sucks that we have to use the regular season as training camp. I have faith Malone will figure it out by the playoffs. Seeding is scary. If we get either portland or Utah I think honestly those are great matchups in our favor in the first round."
"Can you guys give us Lavine btw? We'll give you Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris, Will Barton, and Bol Bol."
It's obviously because of Will Barton the Embiid stopper. GTFO
A lot of Nuggets fans HATE Barton. I get it but he always looks to get Joker the ball and he’s a smart player. I will say Malone has his favorites and he can get stuck w rotations that don’t work sometimes but he usually gets proven right. Fans were clamoring for Zeke Nnaji this year and he played him 30 min against ATL and he got 7 pts. People clamoring for MPJ to start and since starting he’s avg like 10 ppg. Malone knows what he’s doing
"the nuggets need that even more  they have had will barton doing kobe post-achilles impressions for 35mpg for years while far superior players rot on the bench  and malone's ref management leaves a lot to be desired, just look at joker's fta   i'd like to see sam get the nuggs job but the wolves job opened up and he must have a lot of rep there"
[2012 draft](https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2012.html) Had Draymond and Middleton both in the 2nd. That’s a couple all-stars.  Not much else apart from Jae Crowder and Will Barton.
"Millsap was not good defensively last year, Barton was playing out of position and getting mauled a lot by guys way bigger, grant was really really bad defensively through the regular season, Craig tries but really only succeeds against one specific player type, and Harris I already mentioned.   Not one of them is anywhere close to Simmons, and frankly tobias and Thybulle are better than everyone but Gary.   Yes obviously a great center makes the perimeter look better, but an atrocious perimeter D will fuck over most centers. It hurt Utah last year, it hurt Embiid in the playoffs without Simmons (obviously he was still great defensively but again, only so much can be done),"
"And jokic runs the entire offense. He beats Embiid in basically every single advanced stat, and trounces him in the offense only ones. Like... offensive win shares and offensive bpm jokic is light years ahead.   Also, while Embiid is certainly the superior defender, no one ever mentions that he also plays with WAY better defenders. Simmons gets DPOY chatter also and is first team all nba and probably the most versatile defender in the league. Danny green and Harris are both above average defenders, abs Thybulle looks like a damn wrecking ball out there this year. Jokic has... Gary Harris sometimes. Jokic is regularly stuck defending a guard coming full speed with no one close to him AND the opposing center. He gets hung out to dry 2 on 1 constantly. Interestingly, on the rare occasion the nuggets play any perimeter defense, jokic looks extremely good. He looked close to dominant against the Lakers, routinely shutting down anything near the basket (other than AD lebron PnR, but that kicked Embiid's butt too).   I'm not saying jokic would be Embiid level defensively, he wouldn't. But it would be a much different conversation if jokic had elite defenders surrounding him and Embiid had the mpj sieve, ghost of Paul Millsap, out of position undersized will Barton, and Jamal Murray (who has improved but...) in front of him. The gap would narrow for sure"
"And it’s exactly why dame lobbied for Portland to trade for draymond, which he normally never does. He was pissed when they let will Barton and Ed Davis go lmao. Basketball is played 5v5 and every player has an impact to the others playing, positive or negative. The only reason to ignore this is if your dead set absolutely on curry being better, which is understandable but the people dismissing it and hand waiving it are choosing to be ignorant"
Jamal Murray and Will Barton are below average defenders. MPJ is waaaay below average. Gary Harris and 36 year old Millsap are good but both have missed at least 1/3 of each season for the last three seasons. Y’all seriously underestimate how bad the Nuggets are defensively regardless of Jokic.   Furthermore the only true PGs on the team are Monte Morris and Facu Campazzo. If you replace Jokic with Embiid the loss in playmaking outweighs the gain in rim protection.
"Garry Harris, Will Barton, millsap, dozier"
"Because the Nuggets played him like a role player and gave him less shot attempts than Will Barton, and Gary Harris and likely planned on giving him less than MPJ too."
"I will say his worst quality as a coach is that he does indeed use players like Barton as a crutch and it can end up hurting the team as well as stifling growth. I think the one big miss he had was Beasley as you mentioned. With Grant, it was always the plan to slowly integrate him in to the team coming off the bench for Millsap, then elevate him to the starter this year (ended up being the playoffs because Millsap fell off a cliff after the Covid interruption last year). I can't believe for a second Grant didn't know that was the plan when we traded for him. He burned us in the end but again, I don't think him starting the regular season would have made a difference in his decision to sign with Detroit."
"Will Barton is the worst player in the NBA considering his minutes and role. Dude got extremely lucky to be under Malone, and he obviously has some dirt on him, because there's no other explanation for him being in the NBA. For anyone not regularly watching the nuggets, don't let you be tricked by his somewhat average stats. He's a historically bad player"
"Bro Monte was out last night due to injury. Monte Morris, Gary Harris, Will Barton, Paul Milsap, PJ Dozier were all out. Every single one of those guys is a 20 minute player (PJ probably in the 12-18 range).  We're just not able to find our groove because everyone keeps getting fucking hurt all the time. We just played 18 games in the playoffs in October. Like... This team is exhausted and talent-wise worse than last year (IE missing Grant, Craig, and Plumlee)."
"none  michael baloney wouldn't let beasley or grant dislodge will barton from the starting 5, jordan clarkson would have to be jc for real to make that blind man see"
"Yeah it seems like certain GMs value high school ranking pretty highly, I've thought Olshey to be one of these guys, maybe Ainge is another; Connelly in Denver seems to value it, nabbing a lot of late-round guys like MPJ, Bol who were injured in college, picking up Dozier (rank 24 RSCI) for nothing, getting Hampton pretty late in the draft, getting Will Barton, too. Maybe there is a useful metric in there regarding draft position relative to RSCI ranking."
"the nuggets bench is loaded. both him and will barton can probably be good+ starter PG on most teams, but they need to share minutes"
"Also it’s all fun and games. I’m sure, and hope, AD will come back and ball out the rest of the season. But we smoked ya minus Harris and Barton . We will be above .500 my guy, and hopefully see ya in the playoffs. Kill ya with kindness and make your team look like a JV team with a senior citizen and a balding janitor as your starters."
"Will Barton plays for the Nuggets, he's saying the Nuggets were better w/o him playing and that hurt the Jazz."
they were also hurt by the will barton injury
Get rid of Will Barton low IQ ass for an actual wing defender. Dude makes at least two dumb plays a game every time I watch Denver.
"Honestly? It's a combination of inexperience from our players and bad luck.   Malone doesn't do any favors to this team by playing Will Barton 38 minutes a night. He needs to have 19-23 minutes instead. Problem is we seem to never be at full strength and we don't have a backup center, so we see a lot of Barton."
&gt; not sure what was Malone thinking  can say this literally every game since will barton came back from injury in 2019
"Sure you do. The Nuggets whenever they start Will Barton is a prime example of what you describe. He’s behind Murray, Jokic and even MPJ sometimes while not doing anything besides score.  Like the Heat were starting Myers Leonard at PF last year.  Again, I just think you’re taking things a bit too personally for a pretty tame statement."
"he averaged 16 on 70%ts in 18 starts for denver 2 years ago  but nah, will barton needs to get his 35 minutes to drop 11 on 50%TS  fucking circus"
"Everybody is so lost. Jokic is playing without Gary Harris right now. He’s in an I winnable situation with Jamal (worst defender on the team), Will Barton (ball watcher), and MPJ (actually he’s the worst defender on the team). He’s good at what he does. He’s much better when he has good perimeter defenders obviously. Right now the perimeter defense is abysmal."
"It wasn’t just the contract (and he signed so fast we didn’t really have a chance)- he wanted to play for a a Black coach and a Black front office, in a majority Black city: https://www.google.com/amp/s/theathletic.com/2297656/2021/01/06/jerami-grant-detroit-pistons-denver-nuggets-nba-basketball-free-agent/%3Famp.  Not kidding, was an actual reason which I respect. Either way he wasn’t THAT important for us in the regular season last year though ofc it does hurt, but JaMychal Green has been super good in a similar role. We will probably make a trade, also Murray, Barton etc have been awful, Gary has been hurt and the bench is just figuring it out. But we have a top 5 net rating playing the 3rd hardest schedule in the league so far so I expect the record to improve significantly as we start playing more below .500 teams."
That's like why does no one complain about Will Barton flopping for foul calls. People don't pay 'em enough attention.
Expected lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Expected Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (10-15) | [](/DEN)Nuggets (12-11) ---|---   D. Garland | Jamal Murray  C. Sexton  |   Will Barton Isaac Okoro |  M. Porter  Jarrett Allen|  Paul Millsap  A.

"praying we can make a move before the trade deadline to move barton because he has been absolutely horrible, moving him will also improve us greatly"
Nuggets need to get Will Barton more help.   He's had 2 good halves this year and they're barely above .500.  His 2 favourite bench warmers from last years both up for MIP now only Dozier left but he hurt too
"Are you really a Nuggets fan or just on the bandwagon? Gary is still a good player but a shell of who he was (especially as a shooter), it is getting better but not back. This all happened after his injuries.   Barton also got injured but is a badass and struggled through it. But his confidence went to zero. The whole fan base turned on him (won't lie including me) and now finally he is stepping up and making the shots he has knocked down his whole career.   Trainers / doctors can only do so much. Most times things aren't just cut and dry like a broken leg or something like that. Obviously all good professionals will say ""fuck it let me play"". But if you see them starting to shy away from shots, favoring one side or another, not committing to various plays, ect... That is 100% on the head coach.   Also confidence after the injuries Malone struggles with. Clearly isn't a lack of confidence or play time for the particular player. But it takes players a long time to get back to the player they were. Maybe it is on the player but a good coach gives that extra motivation/confidence to help that player get back."
"Bradley Beal is the worst defender at SG in the league by and is negative in most advanced stat metrics.   Jokic is far from it and is positive in most advances stay metrics. If only Jokic had LeBron, Schroeder,  Gasol and others to help him, instead he has MPJ playing at the 3, 36 year old millsap, Monte Morris, and will Barton."
"Will Barton was much better than him during the regular season even though he was good, Gary doesn’t even play the same position and hardly had a huge offensive role other than shooting when open/cutting which was grants exact role which he didn’t exactly do that efficiently in the playoffs."
They made a mistake giving him a smaller role than will Barton and Gary Harris all of last season.
"yeah because team's can't make mistakes. Face it, the team that played gary harris and will barton more than Jerami Grant fucked up."
"Probably because he's obviously a 4 in this nba. Malone is playing him out of position like he did jokic for over a year, Murray in the 4th quarter for 2 years with jameer Nelson, and now porter. Oh also will barton."
"The problem isn't Murray, he's playing through injury currently and is clearly in his head. He'll get back to form.  The problem is we have a coach giving players like Will Barton and Paul Millsap 35+ minutes a game. The problem is we keep losing players to time off, injuries to Gary Harris and in the bench and MPJ missing time due to covid. The problem is we lost Grant and Plumlee and we didn't add enough value to replace them. All of those are contributing far more than Jamal's stepback, I'd say."
it's no less stupid than believing that will barton is a beasley or grant level player
Will Barton got that yolo energy to his game. Plays like he think he’s the best player on the court
"Better: Monte Morris. Underrated back up guard, probably best in the league (a lil bias). Smart player and knows to take care of the rock.  Worse: Will Barton. Super inconsistent. I’d rather play MPJ with heavy minutes."
"Will Barton was awesome last year, is he bad this year?"
"This time last year, Will Barton was the second best player on their team..."
I’ll send them will Barton
"There's been injuries to role players as well, they just don't get nearly as much attention. But Danny Green, KCP, De'Andre Hunter, Donte DiVincenzo, Alex Caruso, Will Barton, Serge Ibaka, etc all have missed time with injuries in these playoffs."
"You don't think MPJ is good enough to be the 3rd option? Unless his back acts up, he should flourish as the 3rd option and rack up points since the defense has to focus on Jokic and Murray.  Defense will be an issue I guess but Murray Barton Porter Gordon Jokic plus your role players is a pretty solid lineup that can go toe to toe with anyone in the league. Porter will get more of an opportunity to grow into 2nd or 3rd option next season since Murray will be out for the first half at least."
"THANK YOU!!! Finally someone said it. I’m a huge nuggets fan but any time you call any player on that team below average on r/Denvernuggets I get downvoted into the ground. There is literally no one else on that team Jokic had to play with. As much as people hate to admit it MPJ is not that guy. He disappears in the playoffs. I got in a heated argument the other day just talking about a fun daydream of trading MPJ, Aaron Gordon, and will Barton for Dame. Some dude called me a moron for giving up 3 super important pieces for 1 guy. Those 3 super important pieces sure disappeared when it mattered the most. Idk man I’m just ranting but I wish some of ours fans would get their heads out of their ass."
"LMAO if missing him is the reason the Bucks can't win the Bucks never had a chance at winning in the first place. Especially when every other team is missing a top 3 guy or has an injury to a top guy.  Ibaka is out, Dinwiddle is out, Deandre Hunter is out, Will Barton missed time, Jeff Green missed time, etc."
Will Barton
"Just look at all the players who got injured this season. Bron, ad, kawhi, harden, kyrie, embiid, conley, murray, will barton, jaylen and im probably missing more. The bubble, the shortened offseason and the condensed regular season this year was too rough on the players. Not to mention jokic played two 7 game series in the bubble, and that this offseason will also be shortened. And as you said, he played every game this season. Dude understandably needs some rest, would hate to see him pick up a career altering injury"
"&gt;Dozier was playing like one of the best defenders in the league, yeah. That’s what it was. He can guard 1-4, elite on the perimeter and as a team defender, and is in nearly all of our best defensive lineups. He was a defensive anchor for us this year. Posting Dozier’s splits shows you have a complete misunderstanding of his role lol.  Bruh, you keep moving goalposts. First you said it was Barton and Dozier after Murray got injured, that was wrong. You then said Dozier started later (the wrong number of games) and that he was ""balling out"". That's a phrase that usually means scoring a lot. I get that Dozier is supposed to be a defender, if I didn't know then any of your comments about how the Nuggets are missing their top defender would be a dead giveaway.  &gt;The 2-way players are Shaq Harrison and Markus Howard, both of whom got playoff minutes. So yeah, we were giving playoff minutes to guys on two ways.  I thought I was watching the Nuggets, maybe I missed when Harrison and Howard were starters. Or why do you keep saying that you're [starting](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nwaka3/game_thread_denver_nuggets_4725_phoenix_suns_5121/h18o1fm?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nvkvzx/post_game_thread_the_philadelphia_76ers_defeat/h14jn17?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [way](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nrvs79/highlight_lebron_chills_in_the_backcourt_the/h0jd7om?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [players](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nmqtqa/nikola_jokic_is_having_a_historic_series_so_far/gzq9wj8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)?  &gt;If you were reading stuff from any nuggets beat writers you’d know that, burn you don’t, because your comments are totally agenda driven.   I mean, I'm not the one pretending the Nuggets are starting two way players when they're no, so I don't know how I'm the one who's agenda driven. I'm not sure why beat writers would be writing about a hypothetical rotation that will never happen, but if you have any of the articles, pass them along."
Whats he gonna do lmao if its not him its Monte Morris or Will Barton  When Murray was there he played off ball cause Murray iso
"Will Barton, Monte Morris, Michael Porter Jr, and the GOAT himself JAVALE MCGEE! That’s not a G League roster my friend."

Bc if Will Barton scores more points then u in a elimination game u don’t deserve it
"This is the sad truth, but this loss will be written to Murray's injury. Also no surprise we didn't win a game with Barton back. He has to go."
IT WASNT JUST MURRAY WHO WAS HURT   PJ Dozier is our best perimeter defender and the best defender on the team in general   Will Barton was out the first two games and not at full speed in the next two
"Campazzo, Morris, and Rivers weren't trash when they sent Lillard home. They aren't trash when they played the Suns.  It's not like the Nuggets went out there with the equivalent of Ryan Lindley or Matt Flynn* at QB. Morris is good. Facu is good.  It would have been more competitive but it's not as if we beat a bunch of bums. This team just beat a good Blazers team and got Will Barton back.  EDIT Matt Flynn, Matt Moore is good"
"Barton will probably be back, he's got a player option for about 15 millies"
"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but why can’t you “hide” Facu on a lesser offensive player like Jae Crowder and put like Will Barton or someone onto Paul? That way you have a guy who can potentially get around the pick for a contest"
"Sorry if this is a dumb question, but why can’t you “hide” Facu on a player like Jae Crowder and put like Will Barton or someone onto Paul? That way you have a guy who can potentially get around the pick for a contest"
"This series just showed how important are healthy Barton and Murray for Nuggets. Our lineup and rotation was screwed bcz of all that shit, I'm sure we will come back stronger next year."
This man will Barton smiling man knows he’s dipping lol
Don’t know about you but I’ve loved watching Will Barton hero wall for 45 minutes
WILL BARTON TIME 😂😂😂😂😜😜😂
Will barton smh. Sleeing on his coverages and justcwants to shoot
"""It's Will Barton time""  That's exactly what Phoenix wants to hear"
"Imagine watching your team's season on the line and you hear the commentator say ""it's Will Barton time"""
Do you think Mike Malone is even seeing how good Will Barton is or does he just have his dead buried in his lap?
"Quick question, when is will Barton a free agent?"
Will Barton or MJ? Honest question
Will Barton can go supernova. Hes done in before. He is fired up. Come on Will.
"One thing about the nuggets, they've got Will Barton. That's a big deal to some of us"
Will Barton looks like a meerkat
"If Will Barton did this nobody would be arguing from on his behalf, it's only because the MVP did it that there's any controversy"
This third quarter belongs to Chris Paul and Will Barton. Fucking awesome
Shout out Will Barton keeping the Nuggs afloat
Witnessing a Will Barton and Chris a Paul duel
chris rocked will barton with that left-right pat-pat before coming off the screen … to e z!
"Monte seems to be doing alright. 11 points on 5-8 shooting at the half, second highest scorer on the Nuggets. A little disappointed in Will ""The Thrill"" Barton and Aaron Gordon's performances tonight. 8 points on 3-10 shooting combined won't cause any comebacks if those rates continue and the Suns don't cool off."
I like Will Barton tho
Nuggets will never win anything with Will Barton. They were so much better without him in the bubble.
"Jokic isn’t the best defensive center but his defense clearly isn’t the problem when his teammates go 2-10 (AG, 0 assists), 5-13 (MPJ), 2-5 (Campazzo and Rivers, with no assists), and 0-3 (Green and Millsap).  Nuggets starters are shooting like garbage right now. Morris and Will Barton had decent shooting nights but it’s not like they were stellar on defense either.  The problem is you think that Jokic’s defense is the key missing factor that will turn the series around when that simply won’t fix the bigger issue of everyone around him playing like garbage and not producing. And no, I’m not defending Jokic’s defense in the first place. I just think it’s a joke that some of you are posting the same sarcastic meme bullshit you’d find in the other Post game thread."
"I agree, the Nuggets should be more competitive in this series and could have picked up at least 1 win by now. But they are frankly outmatched by this Suns team.  Being injured =/ being hurt. Everyone, especially at this stage of the season, is hurt. Jamal Murray physically can’t play with a torn ACL and Will Barton is taking a legit risk playing the limited minutes he is playing with a strained hamstring. Chris Paul is a beast but the idea that he’s just mentally tougher and that’s how he’s getting through his shoulder contusion is laughable. He’s 90% healthy and was 80% during the Lakers series. Also, it’s the pros man. Everyone wants to win. No one “wants it more” than someone else.  Every team is an injury or two away from having their season drastically change. There’s only 5 guys on the court for one team. Do you not remember the Phoenix vs LA series that just happened? That series changed dramatically depending on if Chris Paul and/or Anthony Davis was playing.   The Suns are truly a fantastic team and I’m rooting for them to win it all after they beat Denver. I grew up being a fan of the Nash and Stoudemire teams. But the way you talk about basketball is baffling. When you say things like Chris Paul has the heart of a champion or the Nuggets don’t have the heart or the Nuggets are soft, you remind me of Skip Bayless in [this](https://youtu.be/xRaO1mN5EEM) video. It’s a just a dumb way to talk about sports."
"he had 4 20pt games and a 38pt game. And he was decent for many games.  But he's just not aggressive on either end this playoffs, his shooting is poop, and he doesn't rebound. He also just doesn't make a lot of smart plays.  Will Barton came back tonight and was instantly the better player.  It's frustrating because AG is like 6'8"" 235 and freakishly athletic. He should be a factor but instead he's basically Millsap."
"no Murray, no PJ Dozier, MPJ playing with a back injury, Will Barton missing games with a hamstring.  Those aren't excuses, those are facts."
If you think that Barton is 3rd best that's a part of the problem. Malone's obsession with Barton will cost him his job in the end. It's no coincidence that Nuggets worst losses of the playoffs coincided with Barton's come back.
Jokic will have help if Murray comes back 100% and Will Barton and Dozier were injured aswell. We had to play Markus Howard stretches lol
"At this point gordon, facu, rivers, green, millsap, and porter are all playing like dogshit. Getting murray back only solves like 35 of those minutes. I don't see those guys playing any better. Murray exploding plus jokic wins them a game or 2, but jokic, murray, morris, and will barton playing with a bunch of bums still loses to this well rounded sun's team."
"Im a Will Barton fan but he has not been good for a while now, this series would be so different if Murray was here"
Fuck Will Barton
"Nuggets never stood a chance down jamal, starting facu and Austin Rivers, with injured will barton and Paul millsaps corpse off the bench. Oh an aaron gordon picked the perfect time to turn into ekpe udoh lol."
"Will Barton can be great, but there are stints where he misses layup after layup, otherwise he could avg. 25 ppg"
"Garry Harris and Jeremi Grant or Aaron Gordon and Will Barton.   Which would you pick, Nuggets fans? (Defense only)"
The Old will Barton 1 on 4 missed layup
Remembering Will Barton at the dunk contest and it feels like a fever dream lol
just realized I am Will Barton at the rec center
No amount of Jokic can change the fact that he's playing with 3rd stringers and half of MPJ and Will Barton on offense
He also lost to the Nuggets without Jamal Murray and Will Barton
"I think we are definitely in a bad spot, for sure. The only thing I can think of is maybe if we get PJ dozier back we can have some extra length on the perimeter. That helps cascade down because it frees up Gordon to not have to cover booker all the time.  [Plays like this](https://twitter.com/stevejones20/status/1402822522752667650?s=21) are tough because Gordon is probably our best rim protector but we have him out on an island guarding booker because all of our guards are broken lol. And cp3 knows/exploits this.  Dozier also gives us another ball handler who can penetrate and get some movement from the suns D so that we hopefully aren’t just [running a stagnant offense where everyone stands around and watches Jokic try to make magic happen by himself in the paint](https://i.imgur.com/nrWNjCC.jpg). Barton will help with that some as well, of course.  That said, it certainly does feel like we are both lacking firepower on the offensive end (though last night was an extreme shooting variance from 3 - we got some decent looks early that just wouldn’t fall) and have some defensive flaws that one of the best tacticians in the game is exploiting. MPJ has improved a lot as a defender this year from where he was last year, but he’s still got a long way to go. And if his shot isn’t falling (like last night), his game looks really rough. Getting abused like that on the defensive end surely also hurts his confidence. He’s a young guy who takes that stuff personally.  I never fully count out this group because they have shown a ton of resiliency in the past, but it’s certainly looking rough right now."
I'm sorry but 30 minutes of will Barton isn't a 31 point difference.  He can keep it closer. But the Nuggets need a lot more help to have a chance in this series.
"He does a lot more than who we are playing now though, and just think about how much he opens things up for MPJ/Gordon.  When MPJ is our 2nd best offensive threat, he gets a lot more attention, when he is 3rd, Gordon 4th, we become way harder to defend.  Throw in a healthy Will Barton and any team would have trouble stopping us."
"Do people really think Barton will help somehow, lmao."
I bet you guys will come out with some fire. Barton looked good and your role players will probably shoot better at home with a friendly crowd
"Valid, but my thing is the Nuggets aren’t going to continue to shoot like this - they’ll get hot sooner than later. And if they start Barton that will be a huge boost for them. No team has been more resilient than Denver this year. This series isn’t going to be as easy as some Suns fans are thinking"
Mpj back issues have clearly come back and fuck i hate this. We currently have to run everything through jokic cause Campazzo is to small Morris isn't good enough Aaron Gordon and mpj can't create and will Barton is clearly rusty fuck everything is bullshit we really going to have to start O Neal for his defense even though he has zero offensive game
Seeing how the best thing is to have to rest mpj and probably will Barton i kinda get it. Campazzo plays with heart put his physical limitations are clearly showing same with the rest of the medical bay will Barton isn't creatinga at all and mpj has gone back to his roleplayer self and our defense has just been atrocious
I witness supporting cast fail time after time with big men. Teams constructed around big men always have a fatal flaw somewhere like 76ers Ben Simmons or the Bucks shooters predictably going ice cold when it matters. Jamal Murray being hurt is a big reason why Jokic is losing and also Will Barton and someone else. A big man is not the core issue but when your team doesn’t show up and you are the star you get all the blame.
"Just forfeit the next two games, let jokic go on vacay. This shit is pointless. Our second option is a fresh off an injury will barton and the third is an injured Mpj"
Yeah will Barton is clearly not ready too so the only consistent shot creator we have is jokic
"well, the next best player today was will barton but he's on a minutes restriction."
Helps going up against a middle aged accountant and Austin Rivers in the backcourt with zombie millsap and emergency room will barton off the bench lol.
"You value the regular season way too much. Barton hasn't proven shit (he was straight garbage in the 2019 playoffs) while Grant played amazing defense on Kawhi and was your third leading scorer in a really impressive playoff run. In the playoffs in a meaningful series I would take Jerami Grant by himself over having both Will Barton and Aaron Gordon. Also you say Grant has ""horrible efficiency"" yet he was more efficient than Will Barton on 10 more points per game. That's why the Nuggets tried to pay Grant but he preferred to be a leading scorer. Keep talking out of your ass though lmao"
At least Will Barton looked good for Denver…
"When Will Barton is the second best player on your team, you know you're screwed."
"The sun's have four of the 5 best players in this series. Shits over. You can't reach the western finals starting facundo campazzo and 10 day contract after being waived Austin Rivers in the backcourt, while bringing an injured ass will barton and a washed up millsap off the bench. Too much talent disparity."
But has anyone seen Freddie Gibbs and Will Barton in the same room tho?
Also Dozier.   Also Monte Morris and Will Barton not playing through injuries and with restrictions  Also MPJ to hit a shot
"or a healthy MPJ, or a healthy PJ dozier, or a healthy will barton  we just need our fuckin team back, man"
This is gonna be a Will “the thrill” Barton game
"Gordon expires after next year. We’re losing Monte Morris, McGee, Millsap and Austin Rivers this year. Will Barton and JaMychal Green have player options but Barton would be dumb to walk away"
The fact that the score is this close is a win in my book with how bad we've been shooting.    Also I missed Will Barton.
I remember will barton scoring 37
I can never not root for Will The Thrill Barton
Will Barton difference maker?
Will Barton looking good
This feels like oddly like a Will Barton game.
Will Barton yes. Blake….debatable. I’d probably go Blake then.  But I think it’s an indictment of the fact that the Jazz had the best record in the league despite having the worst best starter on their team of the top 10 teams in the playoffs.
Royce O’Neale?? You think he’s better than Will Barton or Blake Griffin?
Huh? That's not my point. It's just that if things go wrong Barton will get all the blame. If Murray was healthy the Nuggets would probably win this series in 6. I'm just making fun of the love-hate relationship Nuggets fans have with Barton.  [Case 1](https://gyazo.com/eb0332dd0c2f7ffa18ad70683f6db813)  [Case 2](https://gyazo.com/066bbfb877e3a9b045ae99f1d1c0a170)  [Case 3](https://gyazo.com/4f9e3a8e55eddd98035068cf3fe5bfa9)
"I think Howard will carve out a roll in the league but for now that's a huge win for us, even for 8 minutes Barton is way more valuable."
"Having Barton back will be great, but I'm not expecting us to beat a talented Suns team this year. I'm more concerned about getting guys healthy and getting the younger guys playoff experience.   But OP is selling our guys short here Imo. Jokic has been amazing, but every single one of our guys have fought like hell to make it this far. And with their work ethic and our starters healthy, I absolutely expect them to come back strong next year."
"this team would looks so, so different with Jamal Murray and Will Barton in there.  All of a sudden everything you get from Millsap, Rivers, Campazzo &amp; Green would be found money instead of ""need to have it every night.""  We've all seen Aaron Gordon when a defense can key on him, it wasn't the best.  As a 4th guy who can play the Shawn Marion role and live off action from others he was pretty potent and Denver looked like the real McCoy."
Nuggets fans when Will Barton plays: WTF Malone get Barton out of the game!!!!    Nuggets fans when Will Barton doesn't play: We're really missing Will Barton right now.
It helps but I’m never changing my opinion on a series based on will Barton personally. But hey do you I guess
i mean they'd rather play will barton instead of markus howard
"Both are great. I can't speak much of Bogdan outside of that because I don't get to see the Hawks a lot. I know that he is a good shooter.  I know is that I cringe everytime Bojan drives to the rim.   Also, Bojan was clutch for us last year, and we really missed him against Denver. Denver will rightfully talk about missing Barton, but we went from Bojan to a Niang that did not deserve to be on a NBA roster (proud of Niang for improving so much from last year)."
Nuggets in 5. Will Barton is our Devin Booker
Imo it depends on if we get Barton back or not. People give him shit but Jokic trusts him in the two man game and his assist numbers will definitely go up if he makes it back.
"After the AG trade, if you actually watched us play, you’d know that our entire starting 5 was balling on both ends of the floor.  AG did a ton to “unlock” some of our guys. It allowed flexibility and fluidity between him and Porter at the forward slots. And it also allowed 6’6” will Barton to slide up to his natural position of SG. So with Murray/Barton/Gordon/mpj/Jokic we were basically switching everything 1-4 and occasionally 1-5 as well. We had a ton of length and flexibility.  Additionally, he helped unlock offensive sets that were just near impossible to guard. We are all familiar with how deadly the Jokic-Murray 2 man game is, but we were actually able to incorporate Gordon and his rim pressure into that with Barton and mpj spotting up on the outside.  [This article goes into some depth on what he brings and some clips of what I was talking about](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/4/6/22369360/aaron-gordon-trade-denver-nuggets-nikola-jokic)   [Another action with Gordon’s gravity unlocking MPJ](https://twitter.com/stevejones20/status/1376563611712229382?s=21)  [Here’s some defense](https://twitter.com/stevejones20/status/1376559673093062657?s=21)   The team was playing with such energy and focus. They were dialed in on both ends and turning defense into offense consistently. It’s the best I’ve ever seen the nuggets look. It was beautiful basketball. Pure poetry in motion to watch.  Anyway, Murray and Barton were a big part of that. Losing them hurt us across the board, including defense"
Will Barton hates the playoffs
Well he should get Barton back by game 3 or 4 from the sound of it. Will be interesting to see how he changes the dynamic.
He won't get a TD these playoffs. His assists have gone off a cliff since Murray and Barton went down. Probably will have a big scoring and rebounding night at some point though because he'll have to if we're to win a game
Yo in our defense Wes Matthews tearing his Achilles derailed that season for us. We were legit 1st in the Western Conference for a while but Wes was our best perimeter defender and Afflalo couldn’t fill those shoes. And nobody in 2015 knew Will Barton would be anything
"&gt;t to the 2nd round with Austin Rivers, an undrafted 30yr old rookie, newly aquired Aaron Gordon, young MPJ, and Jokic. Bench was diminished due to Will Barton &amp; Dozier also being hurt. Ta  tbf they had a hobbled CP3 for the two games that the Lakers won"
"They are definitely good enough. They got to the 2nd round with Austin Rivers, an undrafted 30yr old rookie, newly aquired Aaron Gordon, young MPJ, and Jokic. Bench was diminished due to Will Barton &amp; Dozier also being hurt. Take Devin Booker off the Suns, and have them play a Nuggets team with Murray. Probably be a sweep as well. Nuggets way overachieved for what they had."
"Offense: G Jamal Murray, G Monte Morris, F Will Barton, F MPJ, C Nikola Jokic  Defense: G PJ Dozier, G Shaq Harrison, F Aaron Gordon, F Paul Millsap, C Javale???"
"If Tim Connelly offers him 3 for 45, he be smoking that good juju.   Barton will never be healthy for a full playoff run."
"CP3 just turned down his 40mil player option, and is expected to re-sign with Phoenix for something around 3yr/100mil. Maybe Barton will get 3yr/30mil from someone."
"Denver Nuggets guard Will Barton will decline his $14.7 million player option for the 2021-22 season, sources tell   [@TheAthletic](https://mobile.twitter.com/TheAthletic)  [@Stadium](https://mobile.twitter.com/Stadium)  . Both sides are hopeful to find a deal in free agency."
"I want Olshey gone literally as much as anyone but I don't think it's fair to say that Dame is his only good draft pick. If you compare his drafting record around the league it's well above average, specifically with guards, and even well into the 2nd round.   You've got Dame and CJ of course (10th pick doesn't guarantee you a player of CJs caliber), Allen Crabbe (31st pick), Pat Connaughton (41st), Will Barton (40th), and Anfernee (24th). The Blazers seem to know how to draft guards, whether that's Olshey or the scouts is beyond me but that's an undeniable record."
"Reading though the list of signings and trades he's made since starting with the Blazers makes me irrationally angry. He has a good read on guard talent in the draft but aside from that he's been about worthless.   This one really gets me riled up.   February 19, 2015: Traded Will Barton, Victor Claver, Thomas Robinson and a 2016 1st round draft pick (Malik Beasley was later selected) to the Denver Nuggets for Arron Afflalo and Alonzo Gee. (DEN 2016 1st round pick received from POR is lottery protected.)"
"I think when healthy we are already a top 4 team.  You don't think putting Murray in would greatly open things up for MPJ and Gordon?  (Not to mention Barton).  I wouldn't do this at all.  Murray in the playoffs has already shown he has a similar impact to Dame, and he is younger and already has amazing rapport with our other star.  We can sign MPJ to a max deal anyway (maybe even keeping AG, who knows), so I don't see any reason to do this.    We already know Murray and Jokic are great together.  Yeah next year will be tough with Murray out, but I see this trade as blowing up a great future for an improvement (maybe) in our odds to win for just next year.  Our defensive versatility would also go down a lot without AG.    Definitely a no from me."
"&gt;	February 19, 2015: Portland Trail Blazers to Denver Nuggets[12] Denver acquired Will Barton, Víctor Claver, Thomas Robinson and a 2016 first round pick (protected top 14 in 2016–17) Portland acquired Arron Afflalo and Alonzo Gee"
"Would Portland be interested in trading Dame to Denver for MPJ, Bol Bol, Will Barton, Monte Morris and a couple 1st rounders? Dame and Jokic?!?!? Watch out. Then Jamal Murray comes back from injury and the Nuggets are looking scary."
I agree that it’s not on the same scale of Murray / Kawhi. I don’t think it’s the entire reason we lost the last 2 games. I think it’s very similar to the loss of Zubac and Will Barton. I think the reason we lost the last 2 game a is Booker had a bad game 3 and Paul had a bad game 4. Bucks were the better team game 3-4.
"That's exactly my point. No one is saying the loss of Saric doesn't hurt depth wise...it's jut not comparable to the likes of AD, Jamal Murray and Kawhi let alone the Will Barton and Ibaka's that were also out.  Ayton has been in foul trouble one game this finals and Saric was playing around 10 mins a game these playoffs. The loss hurts Phx no doubt but it isnt a series altering injury that validates blowing a 2-0 lead if Bucks win"

Utah still have the same issues in the playoffs until we see significant roster improvements.   Suns will likely be worse as their role players get paid (Craig/Payne) and/or recover from injury (Saric)  Denver does depend on Murray/MPJ and on if they can re-sign Barton  Mavs depends on roster changes in offseason  Lakers are obviously the team to beat but I think GSW could reasonably be better than the other teams by the end of the year (though likely lower in the standings) and potentially make a run to the WCF depending on the offseason
"You're kind of ignoring all the *other* guys who went in the second round - Crowder, Draymond, Middleton, Will Barton.  Yeah, no one expects you to hit on a second rounder like Draymond, but you could have had any one of those guys.  Hell, even Mike Scott has had a better career.      You called Sullinger a ""double double machine"" but that's stretching it a bit.  If that was the case, he would have averaged a double double or at least been comfortably in that per 36, and that's not the case (he barely cleared 10 RPG in per 36).  You look at his box scores and you don't see tons of double doubles.  14-15 was probably his best season and he had a total of 12 in 58 games.      I know you can find tons of guys picked at 21 who have nowhere near the total counting stats of him, but the bottom line is the guy ate himself out of the league after five seasons and the Celtics got mediocre production out of him, sometimes on some really bad teams.  He should be like a solid C or C-."
"Jamal Murray, MPJ, Will Barton for Dame, RoCo  Then Aaron Gordon for Norman Powell Sign and Trade"
Kenyon Martin----Aaron Gordon(there isnt a great one for this)  Keith Van Horn---Bojan Bogdanovic/Tobias Harris   Kerry Kittles----Will Barton  Richard Jefferson----yeah I guess Bridges isnt bad
"Ben Simmons in the 80s would be ridiculous. I think Joe Dumars would be really good nowadays, same with Bill Lambier who’d basically just be Brook Lopez with attitude.  Kenny Smith would honestly be a solid PG now since he had size and shooting ability, I could see a something like Will Barton in him.  DWade would be fantastic in today’s faster and more spacious game."
Will Barton + bol bol + 26 might get us something decent. Most likely not gonna happen tho
The nuggets beat them without Murray and Will Barton. I'm not optimistic that a coaching change is gonna fix that abyssmal defense
"Because not only is KD bigger than Dame in terms of fame, the Blazers were better than the Nuggets.  No disrespect to either teams, and I do recognize that a lot of Blazers players had disappointing performances (particularly McCollum), but the Nuggets had no Jamal Murray and Will Barton. Their starting backcourt was Rivers and Campazzo, with almost no shot creation outside of Jokic. The Blazers were clearly more talented and were generally expected to win.   Might as well blame the Blazers defense, certainly giving up 120 points per game to a team like that was pretty embarrassing."
"Nah I love Ty Lawson. Sure he ruined his career but I have good memories of those Nuggets team. I would say easily it has been Will Barton. A lot of injuries and a lot of ""me me me"". The worst thing is he is needed next season the most while Murray is out so we are stuck with him for another season"
"It wasn’t just Murray, Will Barton and PJ Dozier also missed most of the postseason. Their whole guard rotation was fucked"
"Ohhh ok. If we’re talking this decade though bulls have shelled out a lot of money building around jimmy and rose. Now if you ask any owner and they say you have to go over tax to sign lbj, kd, and Curry they will 1000% do it every time because they know they’ll win and it’s worth it. When it comes to going over to sign fringe all stars and their still a long shot to win most teams other than I guess lakers, nets, and warriors will say no. Those kd warriors years were really ugly for the league you legit had rockets, warriors, Cavs, and raptors as really the only teams trying to win everyone else was tanking or saving money for the future. I guess it played out for him but if I’m giannis I would’ve left because it makes no sense to let brogdon walk. Some say same was mad about Portland letting will Barton walk as well."
I upvoted to try and save. Questions and genuine discussions shouldnt be downvoted!   I don't think anyone beats the lakers with fully healthy Lebron and AD. They were obviously up in the series even playing hurt before AD was totally out.   Nuggets probably had a chance with a healthy murray / will barton / mpj and all them.
"Aaron Gordon, Will Barton and.a 1st"
Yes. Well I'd say he's like a trashman's Will Barton. I don't think Zach and Coby's athleticism is comparable.
"Eh, I don't think he's a choker like that where I think it's all been mental or anything. I think his teams/he hasn't been good enough or he gets injured. His almost fully healthy team beat teams devasted by injury. No one will care in 5 years if they win the title but I'm not going to pretend this road was hard for them. KCP, Davis, Barton, Murray, MPJ, Kawhi, etc. Getting to the finals isn't easy but this is as easy as it gets."
"It is crazy to watch this subreddit seriously consider Brogdon + 1 round for Simmons a good trade. Think I need to unfollow for awhile.   Too many fantasy basketball managers who think Ben Simmons is soooooo bad, but still want him on their team and think Will Barton and a couple of picks would be “close.”"
Drafted :  Dame Lillard Meyers Leonard  Will Barton CJ McCollum Rondae Hollis-Jefferson Justin Jackson Harry Giles Caleb Swanigan Anfernee Simon Traded for the pick for Gary Trent  That’s not poor drafting if you ask me
"His assists were hampered by having Jamal Murray, Will Barton and PJ Dozier out.   You can throw as many perfect passes as you want, but if they're to Austin Rivers or Facu Campazzo they're not going to register as stats and people on reddit will say you're not an elite playmaker."
"This feels like a disingenuous conversation because you’re trying so hard to say Barton played better than ever yet he’s played in 3 total playoff series, including this year. And he barely played in the 2014 year. Like no shit. Will Barton has rarely been to the playoffs."
"&gt;Westbrook had a quad issue that didn’t allow him to drive and was clearly off from covid.  Yeah him underperforming year and year is obviously because of COVID.  Give me a break lmao. Westbrook looked 100% health-wise. He was just flat out playing like shit. Couldn’t hit a jump shot to save his life.  &gt;When did I compare them? By this subs logic. If the heat took the fully healthy lakers to 6 without a healthy Bam and their LEADING scorer, surely they would have won if everyone was healthy  Is this a rhetorical question?  &gt;I also love how you threw in will Barton, monte Morris, Marcus Morris, and ibaka lmfao   I threw in those guys because it caused Denver to have to start Facu Campazzo and Austin Rivers. Probably should have listed PJ Dozier as well."
"Westbrook had a quad issue that didn’t allow him to drive and was clearly off from covid.  When did I compare them? By this subs logic.

"I actually do not ding Olshey for that trade, it was good process when they made it.  Afflalo was a valuable contributor and the Blazers were getting him to boost their rotation as a 6th man heading into the playoffs.  It sucks that shortly thereafter Wes tore his achilles and that was pretty much it for their hopes that season.  Giving up a first &amp; Barton wasn't a bad price at that time, Will was a very inconsistent end of bench guy that the Blazers were going to have to pay &amp; didn't want to.  It was fine process, just poor results."
"They said fully healthy, with Murray and a healthy Will Barton, there weren't many teams playing better than the Nuggets were going into the playoffs. Also, a not having to have the ball 80% of the time to initiate his whole team's offense Jokic is a bad man."
"How did 2019 raptors have more luck than this year? I want suns to win but  Round 1) crippled AD. round 2) no Jamal, Barton. round 3) no Kawhi  The finals wouldve been the first healthy series (apart from hawks bucks) and now Giannis/trae will probably miss multiple games if they make it.  It reminds me of the 1999 shortened season. I remember a bill Simmons pod on it 3 years ago. He said going into that year the heat were a big favourite. But coming out of it all the youngest teams were on top and got injured the least (won by a ~22 year old Duncan). Young players can handle playing games with no rest  and won't get injured as much."
Will Barton is going to make much more than that
"Will Barton and Jamal were injured against a pretty much completely healthy suns. They had to start campazzo and rivers in game 1.  The lakers won 2 games with a healthy bron and AD against the clearly limited Chris Paul. AD sucked in game 4 and got hurt, then they proceeded to get their asses kicked the rest of the way.  Go lookup the definition of context"
"Payne had several chances to prove himself and likely because he was the 14th pick. For whatever reason lottery picks tend to get a lot more chances. Probably because of their physical profile or maybe reputation in college. Lets not pretend he didn’t get his opportunities, it just took time for him to mature as a player. It’s not unheard of and actually happens pretty often. Will Barton used to be out of the league in the same way and played himself into the league once he matured. Same with PJ Tucker. There is an entire list of players with a similar profile. That’s just how the league is."
"How does the 2020 Lakers playing in a bubble count as lucky? If anything, that’s bad luck for the Lakers because they should’ve had homecourt throughout.   Plus, as others have pointed out, Avery Bradley was a key part of that team and didn’t play in the bubble, so I’d say that at least cancels out Will Barton.  Also, the fact that the Lakers won in 5 against the Blazers and Nuggets makes people less concerned about the injuries to Lillard and Barton (lol)."
"One of them needs to improve defensively imo (most likely will be Jokic as he's already underrated there imo). Gordon was an upgrade from Harris overall, but I think Denver still would benefit from a Gary Harris type player in the starting lineup instead of Barton."
Nuggets were down Will Barton last year who would have started
Him and Will Barton remind me of Tory Lanez
"You said they beat every team at full strength which wasn't the case, dame is clearly the best blazers player and westbrook was the 2nd best player on that rockets team last year.   Westbrook averaged 27/8/7 for the rockets surely a healthy westbrook would have helped them  Also will barton was out for the nuggets in the WCF I believe  and if your argument is that ""these guys suck in the playoffs because they never win"" well then the nuggets and clippers haven't won championships either so what does it matter if they have injuries"
Kawhi - superstar obviously but I feel like he'll just stay home  DeMar - definitely had a career resurgence but I think a huge part of that has been him moving to the 4. If this is a point you'd want to debate though I'd be happy to listen because there definitely is an argument.  Doug McDermott - see above   Otto Porter Jr - high on the guy but extremely injury prone   Norman Powell / Will Barton / Josh Hart - undersized for the 3  Batum - Potentially an option but he's getting up there in years and I think he'll only be motivated on a true contender   Oubre / Fournier - solid players but flawed and really don't get teams like the Blazers over the hump  Iggy / Ariza - Old
"Dame, Russ, will Barton injured last year"
This team is good enough to win a championship without injury. Anyone who disagrees didn't watch the stretch of games between the Gordon trade and Murray's ACL tear.   I try to resign Will Barton and run it back.
Exactly. They just need Murray back and they need to flip Will Barton asap. He’s often injured and his contribution is not worth his salary. It’s obvious as well that he doesn’t take conditioning seriously.
"Wtf are you talking about? Their starting lineup when healthy was Murray / Barton / MPJ / Gordon / Jokic.  You're telling me their PG was Will Barton? Not the guy bringing the ball up, initiating all the offense, and running all of the PnR? What? Lol"
I would say sun since their oppenent lost their main star each round except in 2nd round againts nugget but they were also missing will Barton and PJ Dozier
"It is astonishing to me that Olshey may be the last person standing in Portland. He handed Stotts and Lillard flawed roster after flawed roster. After drafting McCollum in 2013, he has subsequently failed to draft a single starting caliber NBA player since. He spent all that money on bench-caliber players in the 2016 offseason, somehow gave up Will Barton AND a first round pick for Arron Afflalo, and has a weird fetish for forwards who can't create or shoot, having spent a considerable amount of resources to draft or sign several.   He also had a team that was clearly in NBA purgatory for the last five or six years, with a team good enough to make the playoffs but not good quite there to truly contend. Instead of tearing it down and rebuilding around Dame to get strong again during his prime, they now have screwed that timeline up. Also, the team doesn't have any resources to rebuild with. The only real chip is CJ, a good player who just doesn't make sense as the second best player on a team next to Dame, but it'll be hard to get enough value in return to not get worse, I suspect.   I hope it's true that Dame didn't know about Billups past, but it should have never come to that. Stotts taking the fall for nearly a decade of Olshey's inadequate work means the real issue is Jodi Allen perhaps not wanting to interfere too much."
Offering Jamal is a lateral move. It doesn't make them better enough. Murray is really fucking good.  MPJ to Portland makes sense for both teams. MPJ has the potential to be a franchise cornerstone for the next decade and a faster retool for the Blazers. Add in Will Barton and JayMychal Green to make the salaries add up. Now Denver runs with Lillard/Murray/Gordon/Milsapp/Jokic. That puts them on the Nets level for sure barring injuries.
"(Nuggets fan btw)  **PERFECT:** The Kroenkes hold true to Tim Connelly's statement of being willing to go deep into the luxury tax, and we pick up somebody like Norman Powell, while Barton declines his player option. MPJ Extension gets done, and he develops his ball handling skills and defensive ability.  Jamychal Green opts in to his contract. Sign some backup center who can rim protect. Murray comes back healthy mid-season and returns to form by the start of the postseason.  **REALISTIC:** Will Barton either picks up his contract or declines and returns on a \~15M APY deal. We give MPJ the max. Re-sign Austin Rivers to a relatively inexpensive deal. Sign a backup 5 like Tony Bradley. Otherwise, run it back with current squad. Murray returns by the postseason, but won't return to his pre-injury form until the 22-23 season.  **WORST:** Will Barton and Jamychal Green decline their player options and leave for another team, while the front office doesn't do much to find replacements. MPJ declines any contract offer we put on the table this offseason forcing him to enter RFA in 2022. Murray never returns next season at all."
"That whole ""every run has some luck"" thing starts to run thin when literally every team they face is injured. Especially when it's the top players injured. Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Jamal Murray, Will Barton, Kentavious Caldwell Pope, Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris. Probably missing more, but that's all I can remember"
You have almost all your picks and a good young player in MPJ. You also have Aaron Gordon/Jamychal Green/Will Barton (if he opts in) to match salaries and Monte Morris on a team friendly contract.   Although I would probably move Murray instead of MPJ because Lillard and Murray will be essentially playing the same role.
"And maybe you get a used up Will Barton back. I don't think TC wants to trade Murray, but for Dame we'd have to make that move"
"Barton had a positive +/- in the Suns series. If he was starting healthy alongside Murray, we would've been favourites. And, Malone said he wants him back.   Good news is that it looks like Nnaji will be the backup 5."
"Jokic has been terriffic in the playoffs for three straight years, putting up numbers much closer to this MVP season than those regular seasons  2019: 25.1/13.0/8.4 on 51/39/85  2020: 24.4/9.8/5.7 on 52/43/84 - injured Will Barton/Gary Harris - defeated Championship Contender Clippers  2021: 29.8/11.6/5.0 on 51/38/84 - injured Jamal Murray/Will Barton  I think that he's been near (not at) this level for longer, but just has been the type to really crank it up in the postseason."
Lakers we’re up 2-1 &amp; down like 5 points or something at the half when AD left.  Portland went from getting blown out with Lilliard to getting blown out without him.   Suns literally went from down 2-1 to dominating that series from that point on. So it’s fair to say ADs injury is a little more damaging than Eddie House or Will Barton
"Legit the GSW guys are Lebron KD Kawhi Kyrie and Will Barton. The fact that I only need to include the last name for one of those guys means that yeah he’s the only one who really transforms against us lol, the others are always great players who happen to go off on us"
It's honestly as wrong as saying that Will Barton is a Dan Marino type player.
"&gt;Ben Simmons is more of a magic Johnson type player.  Jesus Christ, Magic Johnson was an amazing scorer for fucks sake, this is like saying Will Barton is more of a Michael Jordan type player."
"Will Barton 2nd round in 2012  2013 CJ pick #10  Then traded with the cavs for the rights to  Allen Crabbe with low value picks  2014 no draft picks from the Gerald Wallace trade  2015 drafted Rondae Hollis Jefferson with #23 traded to get Mason Plumlee. Drafted Pat Connoughton in the 2nd round  2016 traded for 47th pick Jake Layman  2017 Zach Collins with a trade up to #10, Caleb Swanigan in the 2nd round  2018 Anfernee Simons with #24 and Gary Trent in the late 2nd round  2019 Nassir Little with a late pick  2020 CJ Elleby in the 2nd round.    All these guys got significant playing time for the blazers. Only Caleb Swanigan and Allen Crabbe is not in the league right now.   Crabbe got a huge payday before fizzling out. Barton is a significant role player in Denver. Pat is playing big minutes with Milwaukee. Gary Trent is about to get a fat ass pay check and Simons shot for over 40% on 3 point shooting.   Most of these guys are low value projects turned into solid role players and low end starters. Pretty good draft resume for not having a top 8 pick since Damian Lillard"
You have to click to open the thread but   “Will Barton set this party off right...”  followed by  “corner three corner three corner three corner three corner three”  Dead lmao
and AD and Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley and Will Barton and a Michael Porter Jr and CP3 in round 1… who am I missing?
"So he's better than booker, bogdanovic, jaylen brown and will barton?"
 &gt;Barton+Millsap for Simmons. 😁  Oh shit didn't even think of nuggets...  You guys with him would be the favourites.  That defense increase with him and Gordon + size...  Center Jokic Forward: Simmons Forward: Gordon  Guard/Forward: MPJ Guard: Murray  Lol with MPJ continuing to improve on defense and the size... their defense will become elite. The rebounding will be monstrous... the size and athleticism at the wings won't be manageable for any team.   Best part.. Simmons doesn't need to score shit for the nuggets lol. He's literally 5th option on starting lineup. Just get fast break buckets where he's elite...  Man just thinking about it even as a Lakers fan I want to see that lol.   I was thinking Miami could use him. They need a proper PF.  Spo is elite coach and would make use of him.   And obviously Popovich would make everyone wonder how they questioned Simmons. Csnt even imagine what spurs defense may look like with pop and Simmons.  But I think nuggets are the scariest...
"I agree.  The trade is unlikely.  Unless PHI wants cap space flexibility because they are eyeing a star next offseason; and adding 33M in cap space with 2 expiring contracts (Gordon and Barton) who will also contribute to PHI success for the 1 season they are there; might look attractive as they prepare for their big fish acquisition.  I think Barton opps in, but that is of course a variable that makes this whole hypothetical shaky at best."
Well that would be a championship roster but there is no way Philly trades Simmons for Barton (who will probably opt out anyhow) and Gordon with 1 year left and no cap to sign him afterwards. People forget Simmons is an all star.
This is 100% correct.  Gordon+Barton covers the salary than add a young player like Bol or Zeke and a 1st.  But if the trade requires MPJ or Murray DEN walks away.  Simmons would be reborn in Denver's system.  But TC will not trade MPJ this early.
We have like 6 flairs on here who just post about how bad Will Barton and Michael Malone are like it's their full time job
"Yes and no. I think for them it was more of “we’ve got Ayton and we think him and Jokic will cancel each other out point wise”, then they hope that Booker and CP3 put a great game together. MPJ is good and I love the guy but man is he trigger happy. He touches that ball and he shoots it. Without Murray they didn’t have much else since Barton was coming off an injury and playing limited minutes."
His assists being down wasnt for lack of passing or finding the open man thats for damn sure.     He was solid the rest of the team out side will barton was mostly trash.
"The others just aren't talked about much. There's lots of guys that you just shrug and say ""seems fine...""  Will Barton, Alec Burks, Alex Caruso, Khem Birch, Torrey Craig, Gorgui Deng, Spencer Dinwiddie, Devonte Graham, JaMychal Green, Furkan Korkmaz"
he doesn't make his teammates better like Jokic. Jokic was playing with G league guards to close the season last year and the nuggets won just as much as when they had Jamal Murray and Will Barton
"The Nuggets of 2016 look nowhere near the same as the Nuggets of 2021. Murray hasn’t even been in the league for that long, nor is he Jokic’s oldest teammate. That title went from Gary Harris to Will Barton last season"
Will Barton.
Will Barton - Kobe Mentality
"It's definitely above this year's market (THJ 4/72 declining, Fournier 4-1/73 with raises, Will Barton 2/32).  I agree with you that we don't really know until we see the market next offseason, though."
"Grouped with comparable SG contracts from this season.  | | Pts | Reb | Ast | TS% | Contract AAV | Yrs | |-|----|-----|-----|------|--------------|----| | Will Barton | 15.1 | 6.3 | 3.7 | .538 | 16 | 2 | | Hardaway Jr. | 16.6 | 3.3 | 1.8 | .589 | 18 | 4 | | Evan Fournier | 19.7 | 2.9 | 3.7 | .584 | 18.25 | 4-1 | | Terry Rozier | 20.4 | 4.4 | 4.2 | .575 | 24 | 4 |  So to me it doesn't look great.  One wrinkle, though - this is an extension, so it doesn't kick in until '22-'23. So the real measuring stick for the value of this extension is what shooting guards are getting next off-season, when I believe the cap is 5 million higher, which may change the dynamics a little."
"Okay, but they beat the Blazers in the playoffs without Murray. Jokic has played years where Barton is their third best option.   They went to the WCF with Murray as a second best player and he isn’t even top 10 at his position. According to PER, Murray and DLO are basically interchangeable at around 13-17 or so every year. So again, if KAT and DLO can stay healthy and they can’t at least make the playoffs, this idea of KAT being underrated or a top tier guy will just have to end.   No, you’re right though. Starting guards of Campazzo and Rivers are pretty OP.   Again, Nugs didn’t lose a step with those two playing guard in the regular season.   Again, I can’t laugh heartily enough at your idea that KAT is even in the Embiid/Jokic universe."
It’s a Will Barton plus a Bol Bol. Seems legit

"Malone definitely not one to play the youngins  Even with Murray injury he will have trouble cracking Barton / Morris / Facu / Dozier / Rivers rotation.  Although TBH it would be really nice if Malone made some effort to load manage the Barton / Morris / Dozier trio, who all missed time last year, and couldn't all get healthy for the Suns series"
"Whatever, you as a ""nuggets fan"" still gonna watch shitty player playing on your favorite team.   As a fan i sure don't enjoy watching bad players play on my team.   Im not here for the soap opera of Will Barton spending his milions, im here purely on basketball aspect, don't care about players personal life, and who are they as persons.   Don't project your struggles on me dude, im leaving perfectly fine."
"That’s true you right. Suns also benefited from the injuries from the teams they faced. Lakers (Lebron on a bad ankle, AD out with a groin) Denver ( No Murray, No PJ Dozier, a kinda healthy Will Barton) Clippers ( No Kawhi, No Ibaka and a drained tired Clippers team ) I actually wanted Utah to win that series because I thought they would’ve gave Phoenix the best matchup and most competitive games. With Mitchell playing how he was and Conley probably being in a better shape than what he was"
"* Kawhi refused to sign extend for less than a max coming off his rookie contract, and the Spurs tried to lowball him at first.  * Jimmy refused 4/40m with the Bulls, and signed for 5/92m instead.  * Greg Monroe took a risk taking the QO because he wanted to get out of Detroit. Reportedly refused a 5y/60m contract (he denies this was offered). Ended up signing a max contract @ 3/50m  * Tobias turned down 4y/80m and signed for 5y/180m  * Will Barton turned down 4y/42m and signed for 4y/53m  * Gary Trent Jr rejected 4y/54m and signed for 3y/54m  * John Collins turned down 4y/90m and signed for 5y/125m"
"I'm not saying we are better or worse than you but we matchup extremely well vs you guys. We are the only team to beat you guys twice last year when you were destroying teams. MPJ, Jamal, and will Barton feast on y'all defensive scheme. Obviously you are better defensively and better rn with Jrue but I'm not scared of your matchup like I am of the Lakers"
"Hmm I really disagree about MPJ over murray right now. Like MPJ needs a way better handle to surpass murray right now. The thing about murray is that I always know that he’ll show up in the biggest moments. He has this “Mamba Mentality” and hates loosing in the most important games. Just looking back against the win or go home game in minnesota, he took over in the 4th quarter making the game close. Then the 22 point 4th quarter against the spurs in game 2 and the difference maker in the 3-1 comebacks, yes they were in the bubble but still really impressive. Also being one of the most clutch players last season. His value to this team is not said enough. MPJ never has the ball in his hands down the stretch, even when he murray down it was will barton."
"I think yours are really good. I might be a little biased as a Suns fan, but:  **WEST**  1. **Phoenix Suns -** The Suns are bringing back basically the same team with better depth at center (McGee). I think the playoff experience from last year will push the younger guys to reach new heights this season, so I'm expecting big improvements from Ayton, Bridges, Payne, and Johnson. The Suns have an extremely balanced roster and are really deep, but a lot of this hinges on Ayton and Bridges stepping up this season. 2. **Los Angeles Lakers -** I had the Lakers #1 before the Westbrook trade, but I think he makes them worse. I'm never going to discount a team that has LeBron and AD, but the spacing is just awful here with Westbrook, they are one of the oldest teams in history, and Westbrook is extremely ball dominant - the more he has the ball, the less LeBron and AD have the ball. This team just isn't balanced well, although there's a lot of talent at the top. 3. **Utah Jazz -** The Jazz are obviously a great team and improved by bringing Rudy Gay in. They, along with the Suns and Lakers, are in my top tier for this conference and should compete for the #1 seed. I'm still skeptical of their playoff performances and I'm interested to see how Conley does this year. They don't quite have the talent that the Suns and Lakers do, in my opinion. 4. **Golden State Warriors -** I'm actually a little nervous putting the Warriors this high. They ended up 9th last season, so in order for them to get home court advantage, Klay Thompson really needs to come back to full form. After seeing Durant's recovery I believe he can do it. I think having Curry, Green, and Thompson back together will lift the team's morale and push them to be better than they otherwise would be, but they still don't have great depth or big men. Iguodala isn't very good anymore. 5. **Denver Nuggets -** Jokic is amazing and Porter, Jr. should continue to improve, but it's hard to see the Nuggets getting home court advantage with Murray missing most of the season. They are a good team, but were demolished by the Suns - yes, I know Murray was out, but Barton actually played really well when he played and they were just clearly the worse team. 6. **Dallas Mavericks -** I really like the addition of Reggie Bullock. He provides defense and more three-point shooting around Doncic. They still need other creators outside of Doncic, but they should be better than the Blazers and Clippers. I'm interested to see how Porzingis looks this season. 7. **Portland Trail Blazers -** It's really hard to know where to put the Blazers. They didn't really make any roster changes, so I can see Lillard being traded at some point this year, which obviously changes things. With that said, they should still make the playoffs and have a solid starting lineup, even with terrible defense. 8. **Los Angeles Clippers -** I was really surprised that the Clippers retained both Jackson and Batum. Huge win for them. They fought really hard in the playoffs, but I'm not convinced they can play that well (Jackson in particular) for an entire season. This is going to be a tough battle for them, but I think they'd win the Play-In over the Grizzlies or Pelicans. As a Suns fan, I would really hate to play the Clippers in the first round (if the standings work out this way).  **EAST**  1. **Brooklyn Nets -** If the Nets are healthy they have one of the most talented rosters in history, especially since they brought back Griffin and Brown and managed to add Patty Mills. 2. **Milwaukee Bucks -** They have a real shot at defending their title. Just a great, well-rounded team and they have Giannis. 3. **Philadelphia 76ers -** Yes, they lost to the Hawks in the playoffs, but they also had the top seed last year and will be really good again this year. It's going to change based on what happens with Simmons, but they have a lot of talent and should compete if Embiid stays healthy. 4. **Atlanta Hawks -** They had an amazing playoff run last year, Trae Young and the other young guys should continue to get better (especially if Hunter is healthy). They're bringing back essentially the same team and McMillan will have a full season as the coach. 5. **Miami Heat -** Lowry is a great third-man after Butler and Adebayo. If healthy they've proven they can be a really good team and win in the playoffs.  6. **New York Knicks -** The Knicks surprised everyone last year and then improved their team this year. They only had three guys that could score 20 points in a playoff game last year (Randle, Rose, and Barrett), but just added two more (Walker and Fournier). If healthy, they've really shored up their shot creation issues and should be much better in the playoffs. 7. **Chicago Bulls -** The Bulls added a lot of talent and will have a full training camp to get Vucevic incorporated. The defense is awful, but they will be really good on offense. LaVine took a huge step last year, but now he has Ball and DeRozan to take some pressure off of him. 8. **Boston Celtics -** Schroder was a great signing, but I just don't see how the Celtics are any better than last year, while other teams got better. Tatum and Brown are amazing, but the rest of the roster is just meh. I think those two are good enough to sneak into the playoffs, but they could have a tough time against the Hornets, Pacers, or even the Wizards."
All of those examples make the team worse except for Denver but Raptors aren’t going to trade FVV for Will Barton and Compazzo which is my exact point lol  Also what is the point of the mute button on Reddit if I still get notifications about this busted thread
"You’re comparing productivity to jrue, who makes way more. That’s also under the assumption that you’re giving 35 mil to a kris Middleton level player lmao. You realize fred makes 19-20? That’s pretty good for a fringe all star player who has secondary ball handling, shooting, grit, and good defence. If you had him as a third option, you’d also have some space to sign another solid role player  You’re be able to slot his salary on current contenders/ deep playoff teams instead of other contracts rn and they’d be better.  Clippers: Morris and Bev make a combined 30. Bev and Kennard make a combined 26, slot in Fred’s deal + an extra 7-11 mil and they’re better  Denver: Will Barton and campazzo make the same as Fred. Slot him and they have better roster fit and talent. Starting 5 of Jamal, Fred, Gordon, MPJ, Jokic  Lakers. Fred and hield combined make the same as Westbrook. Slot them in and they have much better roster fit  Dallas: KP makes 11 mil more, build around Fred + a 11 mil piece and they probably beat the clippers this year  Sixers:  Fred and another 20 mil PG slotted in instead of Ben and Danny green makes them better.  I can go on if you want, its clearly possible to construct deep playoff teams around his contract. You don’t know what you’re talking about"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"I think Denver is mostly ok at guard with Barton, Monte, PJ and Facu. Unless they all get injured at the same time again. Markus Howard will get some more minutes also. The man is walking bucket, if he can stay on the floor defensively is another story. Add MPJ getting more reps running pick and roll, and Jamal coming back and things get crowded pretty quickly.   Schroder's attitude may be a concern. Denver plays a pretty unique style of basketball. With Jokic everyone eats and there isn't a lot of room for selfish play. Schroder will be playing for his next contract and I can see his minutes and shots being an issue for him.   I certainly don't think it's a no-brainer to bring him in."
He should go to the Nuggets since Will Barton will most likely be injured again.
"He’s an ok player but in my opinion the contract he was given is too much for what he contributes to the Nuggets. Also, he’s often injured nowadays anyway. His frame is a target for players on offense since I’ve seen him several times being targeted as the defensive hole.  The weakness of this Nuggets team is at SG and they could have done so much better than Will “No More Thrill” Barton."
Why did your team bring back skinny Will Barton?
Will Barton
Will Barton
"I'm saying that the scheme the Nuggets play, where Jokic is high on pick and rolls and aggressively blitzes the ball handler instead of playing drop actually prevents a lot of shots that would happen in the paint and/or the rim. He also played 36+ min per game so hes by far and away the guard in charge of guarding those spots on the floor.   The Nuggets were one of the worst teams in the league preventing corner 3s, which again highlights guys like Ben Simmons and Matisse being better defenders than MPJ and Will Barton unless you're saying Embiid is actually the one guarding the corner.  I can virtually guarantee I watch more of both than most on this sub. This sub just assumes every center in the league either plays drop or switches, which isnt the case at all."
And Will Barton and Austin Rivers at the 2.  How could it be the deepest roster in the league if you don't even have a single starter-quality SG on the roster?
Trading Will Barton for Aaron Afflalo and also Jermaine O’Neal for Dale Davis and Joe Klein
He and Will Barton are two rotation guys I wish the Blazers had hung onto.
"We develop players probably better than average. Dame and CJ are both homegrown. Gary Trent, Nic Batum, Pat Connaughton, Will Barton, Ed Davis, Moses Brown etc al. Lots of guys got their starts here."
Re-signing Will Barton for $16m was not the way
Aaron Gordon + Will Barton + Bol Bol + 1RP
"See:  Denver starting last year with Murray, Monte Morris, Gary Harris, Will Barton, PJ Dozier, and Facu and having a starting backcourt of Facu and Austin Rivers come playoff time.  Depth is a wonderful thing to have."
Will Barton for example  Declined his 14.7 million dollar player option and crossed the threshold into the Ballers' club by signing for 16 million per
"FYI  - Marcus Camby retired before Will Barton was traded  - ""2014 (Portlands 24th pick was given in 2011 to Charlotte as part of the trade that got them 65 games of Gerald Wallace"": We traded Gerald Wallace for Dame, so this is moot.  edit: upon further review, you are highlighting the late first draft picks they always get. They get these picks because they are good."
"Damn, you're right   2012 Pick 6 Damian Lillard - Home run pick  Pick 11 Meyers Leonard (career backup and heated gamer)  Pick 40 Will Barton (traded third year with others for 35 year old Marcus Camby)  Pick 41 Tyshawn Taylor (traded)  2013 Pick 10 CJ McCollum - another good one  Pick 39 Jeff Withey (traded)  Pick 40 Grant Jerrett (traded)  Pick 45 Marko Todorovic (traded)  2014 (Portlands 24th pick was given in 2011 to Charlotte as part of the trade that got them 65 games of Gerald Wallace  2015 Pick 23 Rondae Hollis Jefferson (traded to Brooklyn)  2016 (first round pick traded year before for Arron Afflalo who left at season’s end)  2017 Pick 15 Justin Jackson (traded)  Pick 20 Harry Giles (traded)  Pick 26 Caleb Swanigan (traded halfway through season)  2018 Pick 24 Anfernee Simons (honestly, doing fine for being the 24th pick)  2019 Pick 25 Nassir Little  2020 Pick 16 Isaiah Stewart (traded)  Pick 46 CJ Elleby"
"Jokic is our best player; the man is clutch af, even his contested shot would probably be just as good if not better than most anyone else’s open shot on the team.  But open shot I’d definitely trust Jamal, MPJ, and *maybe* Will Barton but that’s definitely it. Off the bench I actually wouldn’t be mad if Monte Morris took the shot as well."
"2022 first, 2024 2nd, Will Barton"
"It's not a premium. That's the point.   We're giving almost that much money to Zach Collins. The Nuggets are giving *more* to Will Barton. Alex Caruso is getting that kind of money. Kuzma gets more, and he's garbage.   He's getting a role player's salary, he's already proven he's a plus-defender, and I think he's going to keep improving since he's **twenty**"

Take a look at how few FGA per game take place in these locations for the Nuggets compared to other teams and it should make sense. Prevention is defense.  This year the Nuggets got cooked on corner 3s, which is more a statement of how much better defensively guys like Simmons, Thybulle, Green, Caruso, LeBron, KCP, O'Neal, Ingles, &amp; Conley are than MPJ &amp; Will Barton than anything else.  With how much better Jokic is offensively, and how his effect defensively is actually very comparable and often better to where you expect a Center to defend + his overwhelmingly better durability thus far, he's clearly the best big in the game."
Will Barton in shambles
Will Barton 16 mil a year still seems outlandish.
Then we will just disagree. 2 years 32 million seems very fair to me in today’s nba for Barton.
PJ will play sf minutes unless Barton injured
"He will not make 20m/yr below is reasoning  Here's 5 relatively similar free agent's deals today:  Tim Hardaway Jr 4/74m - better then Oubre and proven fit w/ DAL, older  Gary Trent Jr 3/54M - Trent is better, younger, and more potential  Will Barton 2/35M - ~even, but older then Oubre and injury prone, also specifically fits really well with DEN when healthy.  Alex Caruso 4/37M - Oubre is better and younger (Caruso 28 wow)  Alec Burks 3/30M -Oubre is better and younger  So for 25 year old inconsistent Oubre with seemingly more potential to unlock, and GSW isn't totally convinced he fits in that well...  Oubre will not be getting 20M/yr. I see the Warriors low balling with the full MLE (~9M) (he'd likely do a 1/1+1 deal to prove himself for a bigger deal), or the Spurs/Pelicans/Thunder (only teams with capspace) offering a 2/22-28M deal (12-14M/yr) or 2+1 player option."
"Will Barton just got 2y/32m. Don't you think Chris Paul is worth 2x and more than Will Barton? I do. Plus, everyone needs to remember the cap is going to balloon in 3 or 4 years due to renewed tv deal. It's still going to look bad in year 3-4, and horrible if cp3 falls off a cliff next year, but if you think you can win you go for it."
For 1 year you will see how much you are stupid and how is Malone delusional  Denver spending best Jokic' s and Murray' s years with that lunity Barton
"because they have no path to improving their roster. MPJ/Murray/Barton contracts are all negative assets that they had to overpay for, so they cant make any trades to improve and they will be too good to improve through the draft. If success for you is consistent 2nd round exits, then yeah the Nuggets will have success for the next couple years"
Lost to Nuggets without Jamal Murray or Will Barton.
"A catastrophic mistake. Denver made the biggest problems for themselves with Barton. That man is barely an NBA player. He is so desperate in defense. Very inarticulate and tactically terribly bad player. Huge ego, bad person in general. He is carcinogenic and unfortunately not even Denver fans and management see it. Denver should have gotten rid of that selfish egoist a long time ago. He is totally bad fit with Porter and Jokic. Who will play the defense. Barton is a horror story. Injury pro, tacticaly terrible, defense terrible, selfish, low bb iq, very average shooter. Denver will regreat for this 😏"
"like I said, the Barton deal locks you into the current roster for the foreseeable future. That current roster has never made it out of the West, and currently will be playing the next season without one of their max contract players. It's pretty plain to see that at least for the foreseeable future, the Nuggets are stuck in NBA purgatory where they are too good to improve through the draft, but never good enough to be considered an actual contender"
WILL BARTON
I don't think we have a choice to improve our roster. So many Nuggets fans are delusional about Barton. He always has negative impact on the team and he is never a leader on the team. I want MPJ back but he hurt his back in the playoffs after years of monitoring him. Giving him the max is a huge risk but his talent and ceiling is undeniable so you have to give it to him. I am just sad that Jokic will waste another year of his career playing with this mediocre roster while Murray rehab
"Sadly, we will bring back Barton and give MPJ the max"
"&gt;Specifically, the Heat can spend the full 3 days before deciding to match, during which time you can't use that cap on a backup plan like Fournier or our own Will Barton.  We can though because we can get to 50mil+ in cap space this summer. So all those names you mentioned are still in play even with the 20 mil or so cap hold from an offer sheet to robinson. We're in the somewhat unique situation where we have enough cap to fuck with another team's cap but still achieve our own goals in FA."
"If you guys are willing to go years with your space, Buddy Hield is there for the taking, and you'd probably get a pick for your troubles.  I think you guys' role in this off-season is fucking over contenders in or near the Tax by offering huge one-year deals to their FA role players. On that note, stay away from Will Barton"
"The issue with Robinson is the match rights.  Specifically, the Heat can spend the full 3 days before deciding to match, during which time you can't use that cap on a backup plan like Fournier or our own Will Barton.  It's probably still worth doing because I really like Robinson on the Knicks, and I think there are a bunch of trades you could do as backup plans so the match period isn't as big of a deal. Terence Ross as mentioned here, also Buddy Hield."
"Will ""the thrill"" Barton?"
"So y'all are in a much better tax situation than Portland... So, Utah could offer Zach a few more bucks on a one year ""prove it"" deal, without having to worry about the repeater tax implications. I gotcha. :)  I think Y'all would like him. He's the sort of person who is harder on himself than anyone else, and that certainly seems to fit the Jazz culture. :) He's a Bulldog, so Utah wouldn't be too far from home. If he could come over to Utah, and find his way like Will ""The Thrill"", ""The People's Champ"" Barton has in Denver, even as division ""rivals"", as ""small market"" fans, you love to see it. :)"
"other good drafts include:  2012 - Draymond, Middleton, Will Barton, Crowder  2008 - DeAndre Jordan, Dragic, Pekovic, Asik  both of those had two all stars"
"2012 had Draymond Green, Khris Middleton, Jae Crowder, Thomas Satoransky, Will Barton and Kyle O'Quinn."
"Will you guys likely bring Barton, Green, Millsap etc. back?"
[Will Barton while watching the first round.](https://giphy.com/gifs/YVBC4HdSpB7z2)
"Fournier is maybe three, four times the player that Will Barton is?"
"Sounds like you're just trying to be broad because you can't actually list anything he's better at. There is no defensive metric to say Barton is better and let's not act like either of us are paying close enough attention to the defensive efforts of players like Barton and Fournier to argue any ""eye test"" evidence.  You're speaking as if Fournier is some streaky guy and not a really efficient scorer. Sure, he didn't end the last season with Boston super great, but career numbers are obviously the better thing to go off of. He's better (equal at the 10-16 range) at any range on the court and doesn't just heave random shots. You're talking about him as if he's Jamal Crawford.  I will say you can switch them around based on fit, but in a random simulator I'd take Fournier over Barton just because I know there's at least one thing I could count on consistently."
"Will Barton has the BBIQ of a 3rd grader lol, Jokic makes his trash ass look good."
"Well, Will Barton used to be certain of three things; death, taxes, and Fournier being trash."
"Back when Richard Jefferson was on the Nuggets he did a road tripping podcast with Gary Harris, Mason Plumlee and Will Barton after the trade deadline that season where Barton shares that story...  Highly recommend that episode if you're a nuggets fan or just an average nba fan"
"Fournier was traded a few seasons later to the magic for arron afflalo. Arron played solidly but the nuggets were tanking so he was traded at the deadline to portland for a future first and will barton. Barton at the time, while being a clubhouse favorite of his teammates, hadnt taken off at all. It was looking like that 2nd round selection made sense. Denver had nothing to play for and gave barton his chance, and the rest of the season and next he established himself as a solid NBA player. He has mentioned in the past that the trade to the nuggets saved his career, as it was possible if he remained on portland his career would have flamed out."
"Will Barton was going to cross the road at the same time a big truck was going by when he thought ""hey who was that guy that got drafted before me ? Oh yeah, fournier something..."". That's when he typed ""Fournier"" in Google. Will Barton was seen puking for five straight minutes, but the truck was long gone when he was able to finally cross the road."
God damn I love Will Barton 😂 love that it was the Nuggets too
Will Barton aint close to Fournier wtf
Fournier isn't a bum like will Barton either.
Will Barton is a better player but the truth is neither of these guys are that special lol
"Just for some extra context for teams who want ring chasing vets. The bolded players are starters. The defense of these players varies a lot sometimes just due to age. Quite a few unlikely to sign for the min.  &gt; Otto Porter - won't be making 28 million a year again but he ain't signing for the minimum   &gt; **Danny Green** - won't be cheap, already a 3x champion so winning isn't new to him  &gt; **Will Barton** - At 30 this may be his last big contract, gonna get the bag   &gt; **Trevor Ariza** in Miami   &gt; Tony Snell - DNP'd quite a bit in the playoffs  &gt; JaMychal Green - not signing for the minimum   &gt; **Jeff Green** - possible to get for minimum, already with Nets so any move not based on money would be odd   &gt; Alec Burks - unlikely to sign for minimum   &gt; Mike Scott - unusable in playoffs and probably not signing for minimum either   &gt; Reggie Bullock - should command over twice the minimum again, dude has made 19 million in his career so it would be odd for him to sacrifice a paycheck for    &gt; Maurice Harkless - voluntary signed with the Kings because they gave him more than the minimum. No one should expect a min unless he's desperate   &gt; Wesley Matthews - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks in playoffs   &gt; Wayne Ellington - likely available for the minimum   &gt; **Nicolas Batum** worth more than the min but may settle. Already has a nice spot with the Clippers  &gt; Carmelo - available for the minimum  &gt; Markieff Morris - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks"
"Not saying you're wrong but since I haven't seen a list, here are UFAs who more or less fit that description.   Otto Porter  Danny Green  Will Barton  Trevor Ariza  Tony Snell  JaMychal Green  Jeff Green  Alec Burks  Mike Scott  Reggie Bullock  Maurice Harkless  Wesley Matthews  Wayne Ellington  Nicolas Batum  Carmelo  Markieff Morris"
"Quickley is a super great shooting so that would be hard to meet. Definitely possible. Like you said he might a better finisher than quickley but with him being less than 170 and in a worse conference than what quickley was in there is at least some concern there about if it will fully translate   Actually for me barton has a super great handle (to me that’s his best skill) and offensively I’d say that’s a knock on hyland. He’s got long legs and you can see he dribbles high as well. You can see that with his somewhat concerning amount of turnovers. Also Barton can play the 3 and is decently switchable, I don’t see that for hyland. Then with hyland’s a range compared to Barton.   That’s why a quickley or Jordan clarkson comp makes a bit more sense to me, hyland would have some concerns playing with our starters full time but playing  in a supercharged bench role with either facu/Monte i could see him tear it up"
You laughing but one thing Neil does well is dip into second round and find rotation players.. pat counnington/will Barton/ Gary Trent junior
If you told me I was getting will Barton with the 26th pick I’d be thrilled
3 trades.  Lakers trade Schroder in each scenario.  Nuggets trade: Will Barton and PJ Rozier. Why- Nuggets get a sidekick pg to Murray.  Bulls trade: Thaddeus Young and Al Farouq Aminu. Why: Bring in a pg for that Bulls team.  Grizzlies trade: Eric Bledsoe and Jontay Porter. Why: provide Ja with another ball handler
Will Barton is a decent player lol I’d be fine with that
since Will Barton is in his 30s...
I'm just seeing another Will Barton
Finally Will Barton gets some help
"Honestly the question that makes it difficult is who is the matching salary. You need to be able to send out 30 million bucks worth of dude for Ben Simmons without completely screwing your team post-trade.  For us the matching salary would have to be Aaron Gordon and Will Barton, but like, IDK if I even want to do that trade straight-up, Barton is our starting 2-guard and Aaron Gordon is like 85% of Ben Simmons for 60% of the money. Maybe if the concept is Gordon / JaMychal Green / Zeke Nnaji? IDK, still not even that stoked.  So you kind of have to be like ... who has 30 million bucks worth of slightly overpaid role player that would help the Sixers. Porzingis from Dallas? Cam Reddish and two of (Capela / Gallo / Bogdanovic - who has a trade kicker btw) from Atlanta? Bagley and one of Barnes / Hield from SAC? Hayward from CHA?"
"True. I also think we dont do a good job of developing our young guys, we keep them on way too short of a leash because we're in a mad dash to make the 5 seed every year. I still think back to how we traded for Aaron Afflalo when we had Will Barton and CJ on the roster, but just refused to give them any room to show off their talent until one was traded, and the other was forced into the starting role because of injuries."
"For a top 5 player who was dpoy/mvp level and already a finals mvp by the age of 26 when they moved him? And they tacked on one of the best 3 and D guards for no reason?    Anything less than a future franchise corner piece or a boatload of picks is shit in comparison. Demar isn’t a bad player, but this is like trading Jokic for khris middleton and then tacking on Will Barton just because. It’s just an objectively terrible and stupid move that was never going to actually help the Spurs out."
Do it for Will Barton?
"Cavs should be looking at a max contract at Allen.  Dallas resigning Hardaway is logical. Balled out last season.  Barton resigned is very likely.  Green likely headed East where many teams have a vacancy at the position.   Warriors selecting Duarte in the middle of the first round is likely his ceiling in the draft.  No one should be talking with Houston about a deal involving Eric Gordon unless both picks are included. As for the rise, it is likely a late lotto pick could be had. Gordon contract is not a positive one thanks to his injury history.  Pacers need to be patient with Turner talks.  Grizz should be all over the rumored Pels trade. Would definitely make them stronger favorites for a postseason return.  Knicks should not look to package both picks. The draft is very solid in the middle and they are in prime position to draft fallers.  Ennis will be looked at by contenders more than anything.  Raptors need to sign back Lowry so he can retire there. He is already the best Raptor to ever suit up. Give him a good returning deal and let him ride it out. He already has a title and the Raptors will come back stronger next year."
I was convinced by those on the game threads that Will Barton was simultaneously a bench player and an integral piece of the starting rotation.
"Okay, so who do you buy low on?   DeMar DeRozan? - Alright that's something I guess  I don't really see Oubre or Fournier moving the needle for either of those guys - not a lot of defense going around there.  Reggie Bullock? Honestly I might like him more than the former two but not a needle mover.  A welcome-home show for Nic Batum or Will Barton? Both decent players but may end up commanding a bag bigger than Portland could offer. Also have a hunch Batum wants to end up on a stronger contender.  I like the upside of Otto Porter Jr a lot and that's why I'd ""buy low"" on him. The other guys sans DeRozan don't have a huge ceiling in my opinion or may just not be available for Portland.  I'm also a huge stan of Harrison Barnes to Portland if they can pull off a CJ trade - not a star obviously but makes for a cohesive lineup."
"Our roster was absolutely decimated by the time the Suns rolled into town.  Obviously you can play the what-if game all you want, but there's no way we would have beaten anyone with our injuries at the time.  Our second best player was out (Jamal), our third best player injured his back and was playing poorly through injury (MPJ), our fourth best player was out (Will Barton), and our best depth defender for CP3 / Booker was out (Dozier).  We were relying on role players like Facu and Austin Rivers to be our second offensive options and while I love them, they're not good enough to be thrust into that role."
WB as in Will Barton? Lol just woke up so I can’t think of anybody else
"* Blazers - Dame banged up and then leaves the series after being down 3-1. But I don't think anyone legitimately expected the Blazers to win after how the Lakers responded in G2 and onwards.   * Rockets - They lost Danuel House after two games, a dude they signed for 3 years 11.5M total. Not exactly swinging the series. Also they actually had Eric Gordon healthy for 5 games, which is far more unlikely.   * Nuggets - Will Barton again it's not like they lost their main dudes. They got to the Western Conference Finals without him.   * Heat - Bam went down when the series was 3-1, true that was a break for the Lakers but I don't think having Bam means the Heat win 3 games in a row against LeBron.  Losing 1 or 2 players in a 7-game series is pretty common and to me 2020 doesn't stand out really.   2019 Finals with GSW losing KD, Klay, Kevon Looney was the worst since 2015 when LeBron was out there with Dellavedova."
I like the Nuggets at +2400. Check out their record immediately following the Gordon trade and before Murray got hurt. They were something like 8-0. If they are able to keep the core of Jokic / Murray / MPJ / Gordon together they are one of the favorites next year. Of course assuming Murray comes back healthy as well as Dozier. I'm not sure about Will Barton returning either but that would hurt them. Hopefully Rivers stays as well. Their guard depth while normally good is the biggest reason they got swept in the second round. Injuries suck but you can't expect to beat the west with Campazzo getting a majority of your PG minutes.
"We essentially chose Crabbe over Will the thrill Barton and then yes left as a RFA but we didn’t trade for him after, was pretty clear he was bad at that time"
"Literally nothing about what you said is true. What do you mean another back injury? The last one being in college 3 years ago? He literally played every game since then except when he got COVID.  And the Nuggets have great guard rotation, including the best backup PG in the league. You are just living in recency bias last season when Monte, PJ Dozier, Will Barton, and Jamal got injured. Yeah when your top 4 guards go out, any team would suffer."
"Not good business for a small, traditionally undesirable market like Denver. Tim Connelly has meticulously created a reputation for doing right by his players. It's the only chance for a place like Denver to retain players and attract free agents. If the Nuggets betray Murray like that, what message does that send to MPJ? Does AG decide to sign an extension? Does Jeff Green come over in unrestricted free agency? Do guys like Will Barton and Monte Morris take pay cuts to stick around? It might be good business for a season, but it would be a suicidal business decision after that."
"He's a worse defender and a much worse rebounder than Grant. Worse slasher too. He's bad at all things Gordon is good at and those are the exact things we need. Grant is a better scorer but we don't need that when we have Jokic, Murray and MPJ. Player on that position will likely be behind Barton as well on offense, so 4th or 5th option."
"Well Denver was missing Will Barton, Jamal Murray and, Pj Dozier. Barton came back for the last 2 games and played ok but the Nuggets lost their 3 best gaurd defenders and the only 3 other guys that can create their own shot"
"&gt; I also am interested in seeing your coach stagger Jokic and Porter’s minutes in the middle two quarters so that when Jokic is off, Porter is the #1 option. This will give us the best viewpoint of Porter’s improvement, when he’s clearly the #1 option.  this already happens - you realize at the end of the year they had no Murray, Barton, Morris, or Dozier, right? lol... it was basically Jokic-Gordon-MPJ and 2nd/3rd stringers out there, so yeah MPJ was out there a lot as the #1 option"
"They cannot let him go. He is crucial to their future success. They have an MVP / top 5 player in the NBA and they will probably wont be this close to a title again for a very long time. Tim Connelly has repeatedly said they're willing to pay for their players to stay he said it when the off season started and I believe it's referring to Barton, Gordon AND MPJ."
They don’t need an all star but a dude who can get 17-18 a night easily  Will Barton or Norman Powell
"Lol how many healthy starting minutes will that line up play? One small thing is, I checked...Gordon missed about 1/4  of his games with the Magic. So he is alot like Barton and Harris. Guy misses a lot of time with that skinny frail body."
They're right below the tax right now so it will be interesting to see how they do this. If they back load MPJ's contract they might be shuffling around salary as Barton &amp; the Greens come off the books.   In that scenario the rest of the team might get a little lean. It they pay everyone straight up and retain their role players the Nuggets might finally pay a real tax bill to keep together a good team.
I hardly watched the nuggets (I liked the team just they were never playing a fun matchup when I was watching basketball) But in the playoffs watching them against the sun's even tho you were losing just made me respect will Barton and Aaron Gordon alot they were just playing great
Plus they gotta pay MPJ too next year as well…and they just resigned Barton at $16M per. Nuggets will have a tough time improving if Murray doesn’t return to his bubble form.
"Jokic is the reigning MVP, MPJ dropped 25 a game down the stretch, Murray was a 21-6-5 guy before his injury, and Aaron Gordon is a 4th option who can ballhandle, and ideally he can hit open threes, maybe he will take a step past 12 a game. Thats a championship level core, not a super team but can absolutely win a ring. Throw in good role players like Facu, Bones, Barton, Nnaji, and maybe Bol Bol if he ever becomes something, and I don't really see the issue."
"It's quite difficult to build a roster without paying the tax when Jokic/Murray/MPJ/Gordon will be making around $120 mil total by 2023(MPJ will get a max).  Barton, JaMychal and Monte would have to be dumped for starters.   I can buy them maybe paying the tax for one season. I like the previous poster will believe that theyll actually pay the tax for several years when I see it, every owner in the NBA gives the lip service that makes their fan base think they are more willing to pay meaningful tax than they actually are."
The Nuggets starting lineup (when healthy) next year will probably be Murray-Barton-MPJ-Gordon-Jokic  Gordon is the 5th option there
he has a discussion about the nuggets because he watched them play his own team... thats pretty obvious. also you guys act like will fuckin barton is the greatest player on the planet and if they had him the nuggets wouldve swept...
Almost certainly lol. We swept them and treated them like they didn’t belong in the same league as us. We embarrassed the MVP. Murray and Will Barton aren’t stopping us from picking on Jokic every play or getting whatever shot we wanted on offense. They couldn’t guard us. Murray maybe wins them one game.
Spurs were the one seed.   You just say Antonio Daniel's because it was a long time ago. But he was decent.  In a few years someone will say yea but Will Barton averaged 40 min for that team.
Will Barton played but was still injured... you really are clueless. Have a nice night it's becoming more and more obvious you really do have no idea what you're talking about
"Will Barton played in the series, and was one of the best players on the nuggets once he got back and they still lost so like I said name someone significant enough to change the series in favor of the nuggets winning 4 games"
Holy shit you really are clueless about anything related to the nuggets aren't you?   The fact you named PJ before Will Barton speaks for how much you know in general about the team. Lack of injury knowledge aside.
Will Barton
"which as a nuggets fan, people want or expect us to trade barton, mpj, or murray.  These guys have all been crucial developing this nuggets culture, and we gave mpj a chance when others didnt.  Our mvp is a guy no one even heard of at the draft.  I think we are doing it right and even if we dont win with this core, they have brought the nuggets to top three in the west three years running.  I love our team, I love the way they fight together, and I think blowing it up for a shot at a title for one or two years is shortsighted.  We will see, but I like the trajectory of the nuggets and Im will to ride or die with them."
"Aaron Gordon + Will Barton, 1st   Or   Gordon , Porter Jr., Jam Green"
I am far from an expert but for Denver:  Monte Morris  Will Barton  Michael Porter Jr  Aaron Gordon  Nicola Jokic  **Bench**  Campazzo   Rivers  Dozier   Jeff Green  Bol Bol  Could be forgetting someone and JaMychal Green may end up being in the 10 man rotation
Wasn't he upset with management when they traded Will Barton years ago?
"Because team defense matters more than individual defense in those metrics and Malone is a great defensive coach and hides Jokic's weaknesses really well  He puts him in a position to succeed  He hardly ever puts him on the perimeter and he sticks his ass right in the paint where he can block passing lanes and go vertical to contest shots  Put him in a P&amp;R and he's too slow to guard a 1 or 2 and he's not athletic enough to recover and guard the big man. He is susceptible to lobs and cutters if he isn't immediately under the basket  You'll see Denver try to hedge with Jokic and he gets burned quite often  Instead they'll try to ice the p&amp;r quite often and get a trap or set up the help defense rather than hedge and get Jokic on an island with the guard or roller  For all the hate will Barton gets, he does this really well"
"Trail Blazers. They've sent us Fat Lever, T.R. Dunn, Will Barton, Mason Plumlee, Linas Kleiza, Andre Miller, and much more over the years"
And Tony Allen only only played for the Grizzlies for 7 seasons. That’s like if Will Barton (been on nuggz for 7 seasons) retired from the nuggets right now and getting his jersey retired. Now if you ask anyone who Allen has ever guarded they will tell you he’s one of the best to ever do it.
"Tatum, Shaq, Iverson, KD, Will Barton, Jamal Crawford are some off the top of my head. I guess I shouldve said top 5 tho"
"We beat the Blazers with PJ Dozier (our best defender), Will Barton and Monte Motris injured lol. Getting them all back + Jeff Green and another offseason for MPJ to get better, we going to suprise people next year, even without Murray"
"He’s a perfect player to pair with Jokic, but not as the second option, like you said. Jokic thrives off cutters and guys who finish at the rim with his passing as great as it is. Can’t wait to see them all together. Hopefully everyone stays healthy and even the likes of Will Barton come back in tip top shape."
If Denver can keep finding talent they should be okay. From Barton to grant to beasley they've been great over the years. Real problem is they will have like 3 guards get injured in 2 games
"so if we're comparing closing 5s it's murray/barton/porter/gordon/jokic vs young/bogdanovic/hunter/collins/capela.  net ratings are 18.5 vs 26.3 in favor of the hawks but it's a very small sample size.   I think the hawks have more rim protection but young's defense is the most exploitable. also I dont think will barton attacking trae on a mismatch will be the best offense for the nuggets. nuggets are a better rebounding team, but capela and collins can certainly get boards. I think they both have plenty of 3 point threats, and both teams can get hot/cold but I think the nuggets slightly more so."
Could also do Will Barton last
Terrence Ross  Will Barton   Paul George
yes it does. cj at the time is a better player than mpj. they both suck on defense . dame and jokic are both mvp level players. i prefer jokic but dame is still good. nurkic as a third option is comparable to aaron gordon. then you go into the part that makes portland better norman powell is better than everyone else on the nuggets. the players that were missing from the nuggets drop their depth alot. robert covington is better too than most of the rest of the nuggets players. pj doizer will barton and jamal all out they trade away monte morris for gordon. pretty much had no guards left over. then you have enes a turn style on defense but can give you a good 5 minutes when jokic. on paper blazer are much better than the injured nuggets. coaching really did them a big diservice. terry stotts should have been fired years ago.
Jokic  Jamal Murray  MPJ Junior  Will Barton  Paul Millsap
"Enes Kanter, Will Barton or Wes matthews"
Will Barton sometimes decides the best course of action is take that contested isolation into a double team even tho he can pass. I love the dude but it's not a nuggets game if he doesn't make 4 bonehead plays on offense.
"will barton is a baller, always has been. glad he found a place where he got the playing time he needed to grow."
"Not the absolute worst, but the start of a long line of really poor trades and signings. The last time the Blazers had a bunch of young talent they…  Blazers traded:  - Will Barton and a first round pick that became Malik Beasley (&amp; Thomas Robinson, victor claver)  To Denver for: -Arron Afflalo (&amp; Alonzo gee), to replace injured Wesley Mathews.   Afflalo goes from shooting 50% mid range to 39% and injures his shoulder in 2 months. Leaves blazers a few months later in free agency to the knicks. Out of the league 3 years later.   Matthews after tearing his Achilles leaves blazers in free agency for dallas. Comes back from injury, goes on to be a 3 and D journeyman.   Comparable first round picks (#19 and lower) in 2016 included: - Malik Beasley (Por first round pick to Den) - Caris levert - pascal siakam - dejounte Murray - Malcolm brogdon  Will Barton (who was close with Damian Lillard) while suffering from off and on injuries, has gone on to sign multiple contracts with Denver, whether he has been in the starting lineup or coming off the bench he has averaged approx. 14/3/5 (fg 43%/3fg 36%) with just under a steal a game in his 8 seasons with Denver. While portland has struggled to find a consistent figure to lead a bench unit or fill the sf position."
Will Barton for Afflalo. Also trading up for Zach Collins (our 2 1sts)
"Absolutely more egregious trades, but the Nuggets trading Nurkic and a 1st for Plumlee was bizarre. Nurkic was playing his way out of Denver, but totally bizarre they needed to include a 1st rounder to acquire an inferior player to whom they immediately had to pay a ton of money.  It was justified because Connolly said the team had too many firsts, which isn’t unreasonable, but then in the subsequent 2017 draft they traded BACK from 13 (missing Mitchell obviously but less discussed is how good John Collins would’ve been next to Jokic), which only made the deal make less sense.  However, they were only in that positon cause they dealt nearly-out-of-the league Afflalo to the Blazers for Will Barton and a 1st. Steal."
"We’re the same team that developed Jokic from a later pick than Bol, same with Malik Beasley, and got low rotation players like Will Barton to play starter caliber basketball. We give players chances to prove themselves if they actually show it, whether that’s in practice, summer league, 5 minutes of play, etc. When Bol plays there’s nothing to indicate he’s improving or that he’s changed the habits that are preventing him from playing which is why we don’t give him more opportunities.  Dude had an alright summer league from a scoring perspective but was bottom of the team in +\- and was mediocre on defense the whole time."
That officiating crew was straight up dogshit. Hassan getting ejected for Green throwing a ref and running at him?! That was dumb but a couple plays after Will Barton had such an obvious pushoff that he owes royalties to Paul George for using it. Everytime these teams play the physicality is so one-sided it hurts to watch but the better team won and still covered so no harm i guess.
"Will ""Literally Kobe Bryant"" Barton is a good reason."
"Same excuse, different year.  &gt; Yeah this is the most change the nuggets roster has undergone in a long time  This is a lie. Jokic, Monte, MPJ and Barton, 4 of the core players along with a few other bench players like Dozier have been playing together for more than 2 seasons. Facu has one full season with the team. Gordon and Rivers have half a season and 1 full off season with the team.  Every team will always have roster changes. The teams with better coaches like the Warriors, Heat, etc. handle these changes much better than teams with shit coaches like Malone. Teams with good coaching figure shit out in the preseason, not in the actual season. It's literally what they're paid to do: to prepare the team.  And the thing is, this is the best roster since Jokic took the no. 1 player role. So those excuses of roster changes is really nonsensical. Malone is a terrible coach and he has failed the Nuggets and its fans."
Will “The People’s Champ” Barton
Hello JJ Hickson and Will Barton
Pretty much. The team went 18-6 with Murray and Barton out. And if Murray can come back in April at like 85% I think they will be close enough for a run at a top seed.
"We are hoping that once Murray comes back after the all-star break we can alternate Morris and Barton with the bench unit, given that Jamal can play both guard positions. Also we will see how the Bones-Rivers situation develops, given that Malone has said that Bones has done enough to get minutes in the rotation, and Rivers is not playing well right now.  At the end of the day it probably won't matter, the playoff rotation will need Murray at an All-star level to really be 1st tier contenders, and if we are healthy we alredy have the 9 men rotation with Murray/Barton/MPJ/AG/Jokic and Monte/Dozier/Green/Green off the bench, with Campazzo for certain matchups, and maybe one of the young guys breaks out at some point."
"Malone said that he is sure that Bones has played himself into the rotation this year. He wouldn't say that if he didn't mean it and hasn't said that for someone he didn't play.  My feeling is that for the first little bit of the season he wants the team to get stabilized with their lineups that would start in the playoffs right this moment. Nuggets will cut it to a 9 man rotation for the playoffs and it would be unlikely that Bones would bump Facu (defense, experience), or Monte when Jamal is back, or PJ.  He most likely wants to get the starters used to playing with Monte as the starter and Will Barton back. He wants to get the bench guys acclimated to having Facu as the PG again, PJ Dozier getting big minutes, both the Greens being our back up bigs, all that.   Additionally he wants to try and get his rotations that he intends to use all season situated, like how to stagger Jokic/Barton/MPJ with the bench unit. That would be made harder by throwing a rookie into the mix who is naturally going to have significant ups and downs as this would be his first foray into real NBA play, game speed, defense, etc. I know we all love Bones and think he will be very good, but it is still a big learning curve especially on defense and if your normal players aren't playing up to par it is made that much harder.  Once the team is stabilized and the players who are going to play big minutes all season no matter what (Starters, Greens, PJ) are situated in their rolls and playing well (only Jokic has played well in both games, Jokic laid into the team a week ago saying that everyone was just running around, didn't know the plays, was sloppy) then it becomes significantly easier to throw Bones in there.   Until then the priority has to be getting the meat of the team into their roles and playing good basketball."
Malone is legitimately scared of Will Barton.
that second unit is just begging for MPJ or barton to be there for scoring. Once murry comes back that part of the rotation will improve so much
Will Barton is a starter in the NBA and he's not getting benched.  Sorry.
Golden State Warriors: Will Barton
Will Barton is the Kobe Bryant’s homeless man
Healthy Barton Dozier healthy. Green will be  a big contributor. ..Nuggets still a powerhouse even without Murray. I hope they stay healthy till he returns. This team will be unstoppable IMO.
Will Barton is the homeless man's Kobe Bryant
"Ah yes, as we all expected, Will Barton and Aaron Gordon pulling our ass out of the fire in the fourth.  Jokes aside, legit great game from our side, and we'll hold our munders high tonight."
Will Barton looked so great that game. It's crazy what being healthy does to a player.
Will Barton is cooking man
Barton gonna have a big year.  Haters will be in absolute shambles.
Will Barton and Jokic aren't ready to let this game go. What a ending to the quarter.
"Monte Morris, PJ Dozier, Will Barton, Bones Hyland… Nuggets are deep at guard if all of them don’t die at the same time. There is a good chance Rivers hardly sees the floor this year."
"You still have to spend money on a SG, a SF, and a C either way you slice it or dice it. So let's say you get Shamet + Bridges and a bottom of the barrel C to replace Ayton, like Whiteside. Or you could pay Ayton and get a bottom of the barrel replacement level SG and SF, like Will Barton and Bryn Forbes.   When you put it that way you realize just how much more important the C position is that wings, and how hard it is to find quality players for cheap."
"Ayton was their only consistent inside scorer and interior defensive presence in that playoff run.   MPJ’s scoring prowess is easily offset by the likes of Jamal Murray, Monte Morris, AG, and Will Barton. etc. MPJ may have the bigger hype but his skillset was easily replaceable on the Nuggets compared to what Ayton brought for the Suns."
"2012 was really good- Draymond, Middleton, Will Barton, Jae Crowder, Mike Scott, Tomas Sataransky, Kyle O’Quinn"
"I searched the Reddit and this was the only thread that came up from 7 years ago.  So figured it would be worth revisiting I kind of fell down a Wiki hole after reading some Tyrell Terry getting cut article about his ""record breaking"" basketball IQ tests   So I was curious what people think the best 2nd round draft class was? For me it seems it is 2012 by a wide margin.  2012: Crowder, Draymond, Middleton, Will Barton, Mike Scott, Tomas Satoranksy, even guys like Kyle O'Quinn or Robert Sacre got a few years.   Is there a draft class that even comes close?"
"Kemba, Will Barton, Brogdon always seems to have some type of injury"
Will Barton
"Nah, sorry that is bullshit.  I agree that the Raptors most likely don't win if the Warriors dont get decimated.  But last year was a real outlier for playoff team injuries, particularly important/star players.  Just off the top of my head:  Clippers: - Kawhi Leonard (best player on team) out injured  Lakers - LeBron and AD out or dealing with injuries   Nuggets - Jamal Murray, Will Barton, PJ Dozier  Nets - Crippled Harden playing on one leg, Kyrie out.  Hawks - Trae Young tweaks ankle in game three against Bucks  Jazz - Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley out or dealing with injuries.  All the serious contenders suffered injuries to one or more of their most important players.  The Bucks did great and earned that ring. But to suggest that injuries played no part is dishonest rubbish."
"I’m pretty sure OKC has the most  Wiggins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Barton, Lou Will, Patty Mills, Fournier, JJ Barea  Also the entire Magic team for some reason"
"They'll be better with him for sure but if Aaron Gordon plays close to his full potential after getting the off-season to mesh with the team even a lineup of Morris, Barton, Gordon, MPJ, and Jokic has plenty of play making ability. They'll still be fun to watch, and will just get that much better when Jamal comes back."
"&gt; Like they're very redundant. Ideally, (this would never happen), you upgrade Gordon to Simmons and keep the rest of the shooting.  Even the salary-matching here is hard. For it to really work you want to hold onto Will Barton at the 2, so you're looking at like Gordon, JaMychal Green, young guy. Which you can't even execute for a while because of the Gordon extension.  But the Sixers would be after MPJ or Murray so they can go fuck themselves we have Ben Simmons at home.  (If I were them I wouldn't do it for the matching salary above, I just don't think there is a DEN-PHI Simmons trade that makes sense for both teams)"
are you will barton
You realize that close to 50% of the NBA are net negative players right? I'm not saying will Barton is amazing but he is playing a bigger role than he should have to and doing it better than any of the nuggets other options could
"Will Barton should have been out of Denver 2 years ago. He is a net negative player. When he makes a shot his confidence soars and then he starts jacking shit up. Why the Nuggets can’t move on from him when this crew’s biggest playoff successes were while he was injured, I don’t know."
"Bro the nuggets have 0 other options at SG. Are you seriously implying dozier or rivers start over Barton.   You're right, he should be a 6th man. But that's on the nuggets for having no better options, not on Will."
"The Nuggets will absolutely blame Will Barton as always. If you're a Nugs fan you already know. Plus they just locked him up as starting scapegoat for the next 3 years.  Honestly with Murray out and MPJ having to take a huge leap as secondary option when he has mostly been a spot up shooter, I wouldn't be surprised one bit if Barton got booed at home AGAIN as the fans call for fucking PJ Dozier to start"
Will Barton
"Monte Morris. He's a solid PG who's flown under the radar behind Jamal Murray and is already probably one of the best backup PGs in the league.  With Jamal Murray out, he should get a chance to start and get more minutes surrounded by much better talent. General high IQ player who has one of the best assist to turnover ratios in the league should really benefit and be able to take advantage of the attention that Jokic, MPJ, Barton, and even Gordon will draw. Last season he shot 38% from 3 and 48% overall, with a TS% of 57.4% and eFG% of 54.7%, numbers I think he can sustain or even improve upon with more minutes next to Jokic on higher volume as he have more opportunities to exploit defenses while he flies under the radar.  He should also see a bump in assists due to the sheer amount of scoring talent around him. On top of all that he just turned 26 so he there is potentially still another level to his game."
"Neither I nor the guy you replied to said the series results would change. I just said it is worth mentioning the Nuggets injuries. I also believe that was Barton’s first series of the playoffs? He was a starter, came back from injury during the series, and didn’t start most of the series (Bc he was coming back from injury). If it was just Barton, then I’d agree it’s not worth mentioning. But the combo of all the injuries   When the East was weak, the team that came out would usually face a West team that was beat up by the other teams. Suns going against a bunch of beaten up (more than average) teams gives them an easier run. if the Suns faced more “fuller” strength teams, maybe Lakers don’t win but it’s a more grueling series that affects the next, and so on and so on. That’s why I believe the Nuggets injuries are worth mentioning, even if they don’t win that series. A sweep is huge in the playoffs, especially when the Clippers were going to 6+ games   I also agree CP3s injuries have to be noted when talking about their run too. I also think that’s another reason why people aren’t as confident in them this upcoming season! We don’t know if CP3 will stay healthy"
"Some generous language here - they were 'missing' Will Barton for 1 game then he played well on roughly his average minutes, MPJ was also playing albeit on limited minutes, and PJ Dozier was a bench player who averaged ~20 minutes in the regular season. If you really want to add up all the ticky tack stuff to change a dominant sweep into a win you're confident in for the other side, then you have to include CP3 playing through his injuries and pretty soon you're dealing with movements too small to account for how dominant the Suns were that series."
"Weren’t the nuggets missing another starter (Will Barton) and another player? Then MPJ got injured   2 starters, another player, and MPJ getting injured in the series aren’t “part of the game injuries”, it won’t happen too often. I think it’s worth noting"
"&gt; made Jokic look silly in the Denver series  The lack of Jamal Murray and Will Barton helped a ton, but Ayton did play very well defensively."
"I mean, he was kind of limited in his options for adjustments. Jokic will get blown by, so he has to play drop coverage in PnR which helps midrange shooters like Paul and Booker. He was also missing his second-best player and Will Barton just came back from injury."
Last season they called Will Barton for it on back to back possessions and yes I am still pressed about it
"Will Barton is 6'6 181. Probably why he's so injury prone tbh, dude needs some more muscle and padding."
"Lmfao I remember watching that Luka stumble live, how fucking embarrassing for both Luka and the NBA, made ME feel shame and I'm not even a Mavs fan.  But there's another big thing to this. The Middleton clip where he jumps into Barton will not be called a foul because the ""contact is marginal"" ie, the refs are being instructed to allow for more physical play. This is great news for the league."
And I didn't even realize that neither MPJ nor Middleton are on team 2 wow this is dumb. Will Barton? Really?
"Aaron Gordon, Will Barton/JaMychal Green, Bones/Zeke and 1st round picks is best Nuggets can offer. Not sure if it gets a star but this is better than what Pelicans got for Jrue honestly"
Despise is a strong word but I've been praying for Will Barton to be traded for the past 3 years
"Any of the 3, frankly. But probably in this order:  Utah just because Conley.  Then Nuggz because of Will Barton.   Portland because Amara Baptist, was so great with Grizz social media in Memphis.  Its close though, would root for any of them to have success in their profession and with their employers."
"I mean that's pretty damn debatable - it seems rather like you either dont watch much Nuggets if ever, or you just believe scoring is all that matters for offense given you just keep saying he scored many points. But - Jokic is one of the two best midrange shooters in the NBA statistically (along with one Kevin Durant - this has been the case since Jokic entered the league as well), and shoots from there quite frequently (and while I'm not going to go track down where their shots came from overall in the playoffs, in round 1 Kawhi shot 40 3s over 7 games - Jokic shot 35 3s in 6 games - the point is that your ""paint vs midrange"" is not really that significant, given that Jokic was literally the team's only person capable of regularly handling the ball at times in the playoffs, and how much each team sold out to stop him - all of his shots are contested too, for the most part). So, all that to say: Against Portland Jokic averaged 33 ppg on 53/43/92, without the Nuggets whole regular guard rotation except Monte Morris, and without his second best player. I'd argue 33 ptspg on those efficiency numbers with only one of your top 4 guards playing &gt; 30 ppg with a fully healthy roster, personally. Also worth noting that the Mavs have uh... exactly zero good defensive players to put on Kawhi and PG. The Blazers meanwhile matched Nurkic to Jokic's minutes and it's worth noting that when Nurkic played last year, Portland defended at a top 10-11 level. So there's that.   Jokic wore down against the Suns shooting very poorly compared to all his previous playoff series, but still averaged 25 ppg... and while Will Barton played the last 3 games of that series he was clearly still hobbled, and the Nuggets still were without Murray and their best perimeter defender in PJ Dozier - the Suns basically loaded up to stop Jokic because the Nuggets had literally no one else who could handle the ball and reliably punish them.   Jokic and Kawhi's assist numbers in round 1 are also in fact nearly identical, except one of them was playing without his second best player and the rest of his starting and backup guard rotation.  OH! And while Jokic's efficiency went way down against PHX, Kawhi's also went down against Utah. He didnt shoot 60% for this whole playoff run. Against Utah he averaged 27, 7 and 4 on 50 (still really good!), 33 (much less good), 84.   That all said, I'd be curious what Kawhi might average without PG13, Reggie Jackson, Terence Mann, and whomever else would work as the last guard. He might average a similar amount of points. Might even still be really efficient. I'd be willing to bet not as efficient though, and likely with fewer assists. But it's not even a fair comparison really given the Clippers were *healthy* in the playoffs, until Kawhi got hurt.   Last - Steph Curry conserves his energy on offense? WHAT? Have you ever uh... watched Steph? Or did you mean on defense? If you meant on defense, that might be true (though I dont think in the playoffs you can really do that), but *we aren't talking about defense*. Literally just offense."
Sorry for a homer take but for a dark horse I think Will Barton has a shot if he keeps up his play
"Sorry, prepare for a long one....  MPJ was amazing for the 18 games after Murray went down, yes. But in the playoffs he was basically a 3&amp;D role player. Had some really great quarters, some really bad games (game 3 (or 4?) against Portland he scored just 3 points for instance). Put it this way - MPJ to this point in his career has not shaped a playoff series in the way that Jokic completely controlled the series against Portland, or against LAC / Utah, or Portland and SAS 3 years ago, or in the way that Jamal Murray completely changed the Utah series / Game 7 vs LAC, for instance. Hell, MPJ's never even affected a playoff series in the way that Aaron Gordon has (back with Orlando he actually did a good job defending Kawhi in their series vs Toronto, Orlando was just so overmatched it didnt really matter).  So to your point - there are a lot of guys stepping up in ways that they werent able to last year. Aaron Gordon has been terrific all year. Defensively he's been incredible, guarding 5 positions and usually the best player on the opponent. Offensively he's really blossoming in the last two weeks since MPJs injury - he's punishing switches when he has a smaller wing or guard on him (which is most games), and getting to the rim relentlessly. He didnt really get a chance to show that stuff last year. Will Barton is CLEARLY much healthier than he was in the playoffs against PHX - people will say he and Monte were healthy against PHX but they clearly are moving better, more explosively this year, etc. It's really not close. So until Jamal Murray comes back the big fill in's for MPJ will be AG and Will Barton who have been terrific all year, again, and some others here and there.  Bones is fun because he gives them a dynamic off the bench that Denver just hasnt had, maybe since JR Smith? Or since Will Barton was much younger? He can come in and immediately just fill it up and score in bunches, plays with such enthusiasm and energy. They definitely didnt have a guy like that last year off the bench.  Last point to be made as well - right now, they're starting Jeff Green at the 3/4 in place of MPJ and while the ceiling is *so much lower* for what he can do and what those lineups can do compared to the possibilities with MPJ, the frontcourt of Gordon, Green, and Jokic is something like +26 in net rating so far - 130 offensive rating, 104 defensive. That rating will come down. But Green as a smart vet who's been around just understands how to play on both ends. Understands where and when to cut, and he's enormous, and can also punish switches just as AG can, which opens more avenues for Jokic and Gordon. MPJ is more talented than Green. No doubt. But MPJ also very clearly doesnt really understand 5 on 5 basketball yet for whatever reason, at least not consistently... That's part of why he has had stretches where things look great, and stretches this year where things look bad and super clunky because he doesnt really know where to move without the ball to open things for himself or his teammates. Or he's hesitant which makes it a beat too slow.  So all that said - the Nuggets really just need to hover around 4th-6th until Jamal Murray comes back. My bet is he's back in March. And when he's back, they'll go on a big time run (partly because he makes them that much better, and partly because after ASB, the Nuggets have 23 games, 14 of them at home, and only 2 b2bs in that stretch... it's the easiest schedule in the league post ASB)."
Depends how recent.   Trading Batum for Noah Vonleh and Gerald Henderson was a terrible move made even worse by us lacking a player with Batums exact skill set since he left  Will Barton + other stuff for Aaron Afflalo + stuff. Made sense at the time but Will Barton would have been great on the post LMA team  GTJ for Norman Powell. Powell is “better” but trading a guard for another guard when we desperately needed a forward was dumb and I also enjoyed watching GTJ more
"&gt; Murray + Jokic + AG + Barton + Monte and pieces is already a very, very good team   which will lose pieces thanks to MPJ's contract.   also, why would i trust a dumbass GM that shelled said contract instead of just matching the RFA sheet offer but in 1 year time to see MPJ's health lol. if im jokic, im walking to a team that clearly has a smart GM and direction.  like if i was embiid, i wouldve demanded a trade the moment brand gave horford that deal as well. why stay in a smoothbrain organization? tomorrow you get badly injured and thats it for your career. you really want to spend that with dumbass GMs? nah."
"Come on now…Ya’ll GSW fans gas the fuck outta your roster until it comes to the MVP convo then they’re all scrubs?  Draymond Green, Andrew Wiggins, Otto Porter, Jordan Poole is a million times better than Will Barton, Monte Morris, Aaron Gordon, Jeff Green.  I don’t know if what Jokic is doing in Denver w/o MPJ and Murray is sustainable, but if it is and they make the playoffs, that’s the MVP."
"Jokic+Murray is a Championship core. They were right there in 2020 when MPJ was a rookie and just a glorified Will Barton (at that point, he's obviously much better now and going forward).   Could've easily flipped MPJ in a trade like the Aaron Gordon trade for a superstar."
Do you think will barton is better than deaaron fox?
"There's a group of Nuggets fans that despise Will Barton. He got booed in the playoffs a couple years back vs the Blazers after coming back from his injury and not looking great. I'll admit he's inconsistent and doesn't always take the best shots, but he's a do it all type of guy that is an OG Nugget and a huge part of our culture. Real Nuggets fans love Thrill, he's been with us thru it all.   The Bol thing is weird because it feels like most of us are just frustrated with him. I think most nuggs fans feel he could be special, and he will show flashes where he looks like the cheat code that he is in 2k.   But his BBIQ is so low. And when he gets garbage time minutes, he takes bad shots, doesn't try, throws behind the back passes/tries to break ankles...The thing is Malone is an old school coach and he's probably just boiling watching Bol try to put on a show instead of playing in the system and playing team basketball. We all want him to be great but he just looks lost on the court too often."
"You must have gone into the thread after a loss or after a bad play by Bol. He's actually a fan favorite.  If I had to pick polarizing players, I would say it's Michael Porter Jr. and Will Barton. Lately, Facu has become polarizing as well."
"It's a pretty bad opinion based on assumptions. No one knows that MPJ will be out next year. No one knows that Jamal will be slow next year. Dozier (if resigned) could be back a year from now, which is pretty early in the season. Gordon doesn’t suck. Barton being injury prone doesn't mean he will have a season ending injury."
"Kawhi had 6-22 and 4-17 games, and was overall less efficient while averaging 5 points less, and doing so against Jerami Grant and will Barton while kd was playing Andre iguodala and Draymond green"
"The medical staff is quite good, especially our strength and conditioning coaches. Will Barton has always been injury prone, Murray and PJ's ACLs were obviously just freak things where they landed as wrong as they could on their leg, Bones is named Bones for a reason, boy is skinny and probably needs a Curry-level ankle regiment, and MPJ's entire reason for dropping in the draft was because of his back surgeries prior to being in the NBA.   None of that can be put on the medical staff, who are probably on the more conservative side of all orgs in terms of letting players play if they're remotely banged up.  Just bad luck and some guys who's bodies are what they are."
I also think that but you know that Malone will play Barton on 3
"It is not like that bro  Jokic- Gordon- Barton- Murray- Monte  + 2 very talented kids Zeke and Bones + Jeff Green is not bad at all + thay will bring some new body before the end  That is dangerouse for anybody if Murray can be on even 80%  I didn' t count JMG, Facu, Cancar, Bol Bol, Rivers"
"Who among the Denver starters is the weak link?  Murray/Barton/MPJ/AG/Jokic  \*Barton is averaging career highs across the board  We also have Bones Hyland as backup guard in development with a very high ceiling even if Barton is deemed the ""one to upgrade"".  The ""core 4"" + Barton/Bones are set as starters.    The Nuggets can take the best player available, and if an elite center prospect gets to learn behind Jokic for a few years; he will be better for it, and an easily tradable asset after his rookie deal; or cheaper replacement for AG."

"Last year Zeke was great against Giannis and Lebron but Malone put him on a deep bench because of the washed JMG and Millsap. That kid could already be a very nice player if Malone didn’t have a fetish on too slow-washed veterans.   Denver was supposed to keep Craig and Hartenstein for little money.   Last year, a totally unnecessary contract extension for washed Millsap slowed the development of some young players. Last season, Malone forced a washed Millsap next to Jokic at the beginning and thus caused a fatigue for Jokic. Then of course Millsap got injured. Denver was at only 50-55%. All the bad stuff starts from Malone’s fetish on veterans and distrust of young players.   Jokic and Murray played fantastically 2017-2018 without Millsap and Barton. Surrounded by young players, athletically strong, a winning combination. Malone never realized that. Not only did FO and Malone not realize this, but they managed to make it even more difficult.   Vanderbilt, Craig, Hartenstein, etc   FIRE athletics and BRING in slowER Facu, JMG + that torching with Millsap contracts.   Denver with Jokic-Zeke-Gordon-Murray-Monte could be a very dangerous team for anyone in the playoff. But of course that won't happen because Malone will play with skinny Barton on the small forward, if he isn't injured by then, as he always gets injured. He will be massacred as always when he played at 3. The signing of Barton, who is an injury pro, brought uncertainty at the start of this season. It's just like that with Malone and FO. Lack of vision about the modern basketball game"
"&gt;defensive stud  :)))))) I'm so tired of the nuggets fans... so bleak and desperate.   In 4 years Nuggets FO made ONE trade for a mediocre player, and they're are all behaving like that was some kind of a big deal :)))))  And they did it just because they f\*d up with Jeramy Grant the season before (see what that costed nuggets) :))))))))))  The interesting question is - how come Nuggets have so many systemic, almost career ending injuries, year after year? Will anyone be really surprised if Barton doesn't play a single more game this season? I don't think so... It'll be like ""yeah, barton has issues""...  Or if MPJ never comes back? Or of Murray is g-league when he returns?   Just stop it.   Let Jokic go and go on with your ""nuglyfe""."
"Sure he's 23 but all those 4 years are in college  Yes drafting older players should mean they have more experience, but not everytime they are. Davion is just one of them  The college and the NBA have a really humungous gap, so thinking he would fit in REALLY QUICKLY is really crazy to believe. Some will, and some don't directly  Draymond Green took forever to pan out, he might have somewhat that role, as a gritty defender, can playmake well, and have a respectable three  Even like Will Barton, he came in the league when he was 22, he didn't blossom until he got traded to the Nuggets when he was 26  Both of them are 2nd rounders, they are, but that just proves that just because you ain't doing well during the start of your career, ESPECIALLY 18-20 games, that don't mean nothing  so yes, the rookie excuse especially since we ain't even 1/3 in the season, heck technically some teams aren't even 1/4 in their games."
I thought Will Barton was their second option imo
Yeah we won't miss playoffs even with MPJ injured the entire season. AG MVP and Will Barton will get us through to when Murray comes back (I'm assuming week 17 or 18) then we will have another 7-8 weeks to climb the standings as Murray gets back into the swing of things.  Also Idk what it is about Magic fans disliking the Nuggets but I feel like there's no better way to tell how shitty a person is by seeing their reactions to players getting injured.
The 5th is will Barton who have had his best season of his career
The even better thing was that instead of having a guy from the stands we has Will Barton and Monte Morris. A legit starter on any team and a great 6th man on an even better contract respectively.  But that lasted for less than 12 games or so before Jamal and Barton went down and now we’ve got this going on as well
"Lebron also did this his first tenure in Cleveland, in the case of him and Luka it’s often best case scenario in the absence of a coherent offense or second option. Barton also will jack up shots early in the shot clock a la JR smith so he’s frustrating on both fronts. But he has those all star flashes that are cancelled out by his decision making skills"
It's a curse Will Barton/Luka Doncic/Fred Van Vleet also share. They are all good-great players but they waste 10-16 seconds of the possession needlessly dribbling meaning there is usually only 8-14 seconds left to create something and there are no opportunities to reset if things go wrong which leads to needless turnovers and bad shots. Makes me want to gouge my eyes out
Honestly -- what makes Edwards that much more of a viable All-Star than even a guy like Will Barton?  * Edwards: 22.5 pts / 6.6 reb / 3.5 ast / 3.5 turnovers / 51.9% TS / 1st option chucker on a 11-seed  * Barton: 17.1 pts / 4.9 reb / 4.3 ast / 1.6 turnovers / 58.3% TS / 2nd option on the 5th seed
"I was a nuggets fan for about 7 years now. Started rooting for them bc Jokic.  I'm done with them.  It's the most confused and pointless franchise in NBA, as far as I know.  With them, it's all irrational, emotional, kind of embarrassing posturing.  During the past 3 years they couldn't complete a roster.  Many opportunities to make trades, get some real men to assist Jokic, were missed. Nuggets FO is just not up to the task. They can scout, and gamble on the cheap - but they can't craft the contender roster.  Worst thing is that they, after they make their cheap gambles - they retreat into their shell, throw money at the half-bets (good money after bad), and fake ""management"".  The disconnect between the Nuggets FO and coaching philosophy is just astounding.  Malone like to play on sure bets... He's a defensive coach, but more - a defensive personality. Hence, he plays Greens even though it's clear they're over the hill and have no connection to anything in the future. He did the same with Millsap. Just a CYA little man. He's doing the same with Rivers and Monte.  OTOH - the FO is a bunch of drunken fratboys, on the chicken side... hoping to go on a treasure hunt for peanuts. Loading the roster with ""damaged goods"", undersized, with serious injuries, some talent though, but not even close to be contributors on the contending team. How many chances they missed to make a REAL trade and get some REAL talent!? Look at portland, chi, etc etc etc...   Oh... Mudiay didn't work out? Marcus is 4"" tall? Monte is low ceiling guy? MPJ back is broken? Etc, etc etc...  They act surprised when dumb things they bet on don't work.  Meanwhile, Jokic's time is slipping away. He's the only reason anyone even knows about Nuggets and Nuggets are playing him into the ground just to keep the illusion going.  In reality - Jamal will never be the same (if he recovers, it'll take 2+ years to get where he was or close), MPJ is a bust (physically or mentally or both), Bol Bol is in Malone's jail, Barton is going into the retirement and fast...  Nope, Nuggets are pretenders.  With no strong 1 and 2, no shooting, no 2nd unit, no real PF, no backup-c... they are 1st round exit material, at best.  Jokic is f\*d. Luckily, his FA is coming soon and if he wants something more, he'll get out of there asap."
"To lock up Barton just let him play hes game, he will hit 2-3 shots go in to his ""kobe"" mode and eventually will lose you a game."
Will The Thrill Barton &gt; DeFrozen
Yeah the will Barton slander thank fully is dying down. But the fire Malone bs will still exist even after we win a championship.
Probably the #FireMalone stuff or Will Barton slander with the Nuggets but at this point it’s more of a meme to most fans who’ve been around for a bit.
The absolute disrespect to Will Barton.  Smdh.
Sixers did a great job but you could literally leave any nugget not named jokic or Barton  wide open and they will miss. You can see the morale leave out of jokics body after the bench went on an 0-11 run

"Denver local fans are convinced that Barton is a very good player. I guess only they and 5% of other people in the world  Ballhog who plays terribly defensively and who will give the ball mostly to Jokic (to not upset him) while rarely giving the ball to others. Denver played WCF without Barton. Denver would never pass Utah and the Clippers with him because rarely does anyone play well next to him except Jokic  Murray with Barton-- nothing special  Murray without Barton-- star with 30, 40 even 50 points   Porter without Barton - 20/25 points  Porter with Barton-- very bad   His figures are a mirage, an illusion   Just look at the statistics from his playoff and everything will be clear to you  Denver’s biggest mistake were Millsap and Barton but no one there realizes that  How is it possible that literally all players go backwards except Jokic? It's Barton ballhog effect, next to him rarely anyone will be good in 80% of cases  He will have his average of 15-16 points and some assists, but that is why others will be mostly worse  He is literrary bigger version of Denis Smith junior and no coach would tolerate him except Malone.   I make a screenshot where Barton stands inside next to Clint Capela waiting for rebounds-- while his player stands alone at 8 meters and hits for 3 😁 And then local fans call me hater. Imagine leaving your player at 7-8 meters alone and chasing rebounds? Nobody is allowed to tell him that there. Malone is afraid of him. Murray exploded without Barton, Porter was also much better. Unfortunately Denver has JMG, Facu, Green and a few other unplayble players so Barton is slipping through"
"Jokic played a massive 1st half and his team was still losing, he goes to the bench for a couple minutes and the Nuggets gave up a double-digit run to the 76ers.  Its a regular season game, his entire team except 1 dude are all ice-cold. I'm not surprised he couldn't be bothered as aside from Will Barton the rest of the team might as well have been in 76ers jerseys"
Takeaways:   Bassey is another increadible Philly pick up  Nuggets bench makes me hate the sport of basketball  This game reminded why I hate watching Will Barton play. 10 seconds of iso dribbling before any play even starts is nauseating  Morey needs to pull the trigger now. Embiid is a superstar and the supporting case Philly has is great. They can win now.  Trade Simmons for Brogdon and watch this team dominate   Jokic looked defeated going into the second half after watching his bench play. Also Bassey is incredible
"Welp....with any luck that will be the worst game I watch the boys play this year.  Jokic and Barton showed up to play, everyone else sent out their body doubles or some shit.  Literally the worst effort I have seen from this team in years, absolutely painful to watch."
Jokic and Will Barton were the only guys who could hit anything.
Will Barton with the dagger jesus
Will Barton
We seemed like we had just started to find some solutions and it was letting bones run the offense (he got hurt) staggering will barton (he was out) and playing zeke nnaji more (he was hurt) so not to worried about it
"Wes Matthews injury sunk that team and the guy was just never the same afterwards. Batum became really aloof at one point too, by the time he got traded to Charlotte, it was kind of for nothing (sorry, Noah Vonleh).   I will say, that pre trade deadline, they did have Will Barton and CJ Mccollum on their bench. They ultimately gave up Barton in the deal to nab Afflalo."
"I agree with him and I'll try explaining it how I think of it. Anthony Davis is a top 5 talent in the league, maybe provides top 5 value in the league when he's on the court, but he isn't a top 5 player in the league. It's somewhat hard to distinguish those from each other.  When he's on the court his numbers don't ever not look good. He has an unbelievable midrange game, he can run the floor, catch lobs from anywhere, and then on defense clamp any 4 in the game, play great defense on most 5s not named Jokic or Embiid, and play elite help defense.   But there is something that is critically lacking in his game and it's hard to pinpoint. It's too cliché to say killer instinct, or heart, or silly sports platitudes like that. But AD is very evidently a player who can just will you to wins night in and night out. At times it seems like he doesn't even want to do that.   It's not normal for a player who is putting up 28/12/2/1.5/2 on 50% from the floor to miss the playoffs. It isn't normal for someone to put up those numbers and only get to 34 wins in a season, and especially because AD is clearly not a ""great stats, bad team"" guy. He's not an empty stats guy which is very much what KAT feels like right now. He can get those stats on a championship level team all the same, and give you valuable possessions on both sides.  A team with Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday, sniper years Ryan Anderson, some ok but not very good guard/wing back ups like Toney Douglas, Tyreke Evans, Tim Frazier, James Ennis, and then some solid back up bigs in Ajinca and Asik shouldn't be 12-26 at the All-Sat break if you're the best player at your position in the league.   James Harden as a 23 year old pulled a starting 5 of him, Chandler Parsons, Omer Asik, Jeremy Lin, and Dontas Montejunas to 45 wins and took OKC to 6 games; and that was with Kevin McHale as coach. Then half that damn Pels team ended up going to Houston eventually too.  KG's running mates were Terrell Brandon, Wally World, Anthony Peeler, and Rasho Neserovic and he pulled into the playoffs in an even more competitive West.  Hakeem didn't have a single All-Star with him as he kept making it to the playoffs each year in the West.   Dirk the same thing, he took a team to the finals and lost in 6 (refs willing) that was starting Jason Terry, Josh Howard, old Jerry Stackhouse, and Erick Dampier.  Jokic won a playoff series last year against a high-powered Portland team with his top 4 guards out, one other guy who could score but not defend, and then a mix between 5'9"" rookies, just signed players, two way guys, and the reanimated corpse of Paul Milsap. This year without MPJ and Murray, and now Barton, Jokic is leading the Nuggets while putting up even better numbers and a top 10 defense...and they will sail into the playoffs.   But with Jrue Holiday and a bunch of 3pt marksman, Anthony Davis had years where he didn't even sniff the playoffs.   That just isn't normal. If you put any of these other guys on that team they're going to find a way into the playoffs, even if it's the 8 seed, even if they get swept. They're certainly going to win more than 30 games.   I think it speaks to Anthony Davis at his core is just a right hand man type of player. He may very well be the best ""2nd option"" of all time. He's this generation's Scottie Pippen who people sometimes even have as a top 5 player in the 90s. But AD just doesn't have that drive in him, or the specific skill, or desire, or whatever it is, to pull teams to wins. Pull them into the playoffs. Just find ways to get it done and get there. He isn't that guy...even though he obviously has all the talent in the world to do that, and has always put up numbers that SHOULD do that.   I mean damn even Carmelo took a team with a guard rotation of Pablo Prigioni, Ronnie Brewer, Raymond Felton, and a 39 year old Jason Kidd, 7ppg Iman Shumpert, J.R. Smith, the decayed husk of Kenyon Martin, Steve Novak, and Tyson Chandler to round 2 of the playoffs. And Carmelo is not a better player than AD, whatsoever, in any way. But he is the kind of guy who is a bonified #1 option, who has the drive and will to just find wins and go for broke trying to get them in a way AD doesn't.  AD kind of always seems like he's holding back a little bit. The other night vs. I forget who, but AD was red hot the entire game and WB was...not, and to take the game winning shot what happened? They ran 1-4 flat with Westbrook who took a contested 30ft 3 and bricked it. AD was standing in the corner just watching it.   Now you could say that has something to do with coaching, and maybe it does, but not even Vogel is that bad. It's not like this was some misdirection play or a match up thing either. Also if you're that guy, if you're an All-NBA 1st team player, if you're this HOF two way incredible 30ppg dude...you should be demanding that shot. Especially when you are just draining jumpers all night. But he didn't, and that isn't the first time he's seemed to shy away from pivotal moments like that.   So in that sense AD is a ""very good"" player, but not a great player. He's an absolute incredible talent, incredible scorer, incredible defender, easy choice for the HOF. but as a ""player"" there is something that is critically missing from him. Something that you can find in almost all of his All-NBA 1st team peers from LeBron, to Jokic, to Embiid, CP, Dame, Curry, Doncic, Harden, KD, Butler, Trae, Morant, Mitchell there are so many of these guys who have that extra part of them. Even guys who haven't been All-Stars like Jamal Murray, Fox, Ant, Bogdanavich(s), grab hold of that moment more willingly and firmly than AD.  I mean good lord it's in Russ--that's half the reason he's so good at basketball--but AD should be the person taking that situation every single time. Not just over Russ but maybe over LeBron most of the time too. That's how good he is. Not just a single shot but just down the stretch in general.   AD is going to be one of the 5 greatest talents of this generation, and he's gonna pick up a lot of hardware, but there is just such a distinct generation between him and these other HOF peers of his when it comes to drive and will to win. Maybe AD is just apathetic, maybe he doesn't care that much and is just insanely good at basketball, I mean he is notoriously lazy about his workouts in the offseason which also isn't normal. I don't know. But there is absolutely something to it."
This sequence comes probably second to the T Rob block/Will Barton slam to me. Very close tho
"I understand. Jokic carrying the team night in and night out is not an ideal scenario whatsoever, but he's just so good that we can win enough games during the regular season. It's also not just Jamal though. Even Barton alone (who we can stagger with the bench) makes a world of difference. He's been playing the best ball of his career this year. Ideally, when MPJ returns, he is out of his shooting slump as well. Bottomline, we're 9-5 with 3/5 of our starting lineup out with injury in multiple games (compare this to the status of teams like Milwaukee who are also missing valuable guys to injury), and I think we should be good enough to get a top 4 seed in the West as long as Barton and MPJ aren't out for too long. Obviously how deep we go in the playoffs depends on the status of Jamal. Last I've heard, the team is hoping for a return around February or March, but will likely ease him into action when he first comes back."
"Except, inserting Murray, Barton, and MPJ back into the lineup does wonders for the bench. It pushes Monte back to being the 6th man. Him combined with a healthy Bones with more reps to learn the game will vastly improve the scoring capability of our bench unit. One thing I don't feel good about is our backup bigs. The Greens have been underwhelming out of the gate, Jamychal especially. That's why I think it'd be extremely helpful if Nnaji or Bol can establish themselves a role within our bench rotation. If not, I wouldn't mind seeing something happen at the deadline for a reliable backup big."
"no barton mpj murray, will be a tough loss but I'll take it"
Will Barton injured again??
Will Barton plays at an all star level every third game don’t worry about it
They did lose to Will Barton and our bench before winning in Utah.  That does seem like a bit of a wash.
he also is missing his two best teammates now with will barton out
"I can't wait for tomorrow's game where Austin Rivers will, once again, start if Barton is out."
Honestly to me Jokic is the most impressive out of all of them right now. Without Jamal Murray he basically has to pray that Will Barton or Aaron Gordon have a good game. Barton’s been very good so far but he was awful tonight.   Steph and KD have way more help.
&gt;will barton deserves all star cred   Huh????
"That’s a fair point, so far he’s doing it on both ends. He did it to bam and Miami the other day, I guess we will wait and see how long it lasts. Hopefully the other players start coming through for him on offense, Barton and bones are looking really good"
"Barton was having a breakout season 2 years ago as well before getting hurt, in fact he was 8th in the league in [538s RAPTOR](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-nba-player-ratings-love-will-barton-heres-why/amp/) at the end of December 2019.  Hes simply a good player when healthy."
Let’s go will Barton!
"It's just a default mode of thinking by fans, they think everyone is out to get them and hate them  Especially such a big name like Will Barton playing in a huge Denver market, people HATED him i'll tell you, the media, Shaq, Barkley, John Cena all hated on him"
"No offense to Pacers fans but I do think Sabonis is currently overrated due to everything going through him he is budget Jokic, but you dont really need to double him cause his scoring is not on that level. What your staff needs to do is to find out defence in which Sabonis is not bad and play it, just like Nuggets do with Jokic. Jokic doesnt switch much he kinda plays ball and disrupts on pick until his man recovers and they slow down pnr.   It is no knock on Sabonis, Jokic would suck too(like he did in playoffs) without good guard/wing defenders that can recover from behind like Will Barton, PJ Dozier, Jamal or Gordon who can stay in fron of everyone without getting pushed."

Will Barton is by far the most divisive player on our team. Hopefully this shuts some haters up.
"The Will Barton Redemption Tour is so fucking gratifying. God his haters were irrational, toxic, obnoxious dults.  And now they are silent."
WILL BARTON HYPE FEST LETS GO BOYS
Will be tough without the Joker. But Nuggets play there best when the chips are down so there is that. WHos going to play center. Nuggets don't have 2nd string true center. Going to have to be a team effort and Barton and Morris need to have good nights.
"Actually going against Barton this week, so I really shouldn’t root for a good game lol. Will has been solid."
Will Barton chuckfest next game lets gooo
It's Will Barton szn
Looks like he going after Will Barton
*peach side bs will barton across the face*
"Blazer fans keep saying this shit. The Nuggets bench WERE the starters. Monte, Compazzo, Austin Rivers. Will Barton &amp; Dozier didn't even play. So yeah Portland's healthy starters beat up on Denver's bench who had to play real minutes."
don’t count out will barton
Will Barton is going to have to average 50 pts a game when Jokic is inevitably suspended
Just when we think we can counter Will Barton becomes Steph Curry
Will Barton is the most frustrating 0 iq player.  You don't know until his on your team.  I'd trade him for a biscuit
The MPJ situation is really disheartening. They just need to take him out of the starting lineup. The big contract just blew his mind. He could not handle the pressure. And now the sore back is worrisome. Will be a very tough game with the only real scorer other than Jokic being Barton. JOkic is going to have to score 40+
"people say ""well FAs never come to denver so they might as well spend the money on him"", uh, I'm not looking out for the poor billionaire owners or anything, but it kind of feels like some people don't realise that billionaire owners... prefer not to pay gobs of luxury tax?  if they're $20M, $30M, $40M over the luxury tax threshold, they may very well start cheaping out on other parts of the roster.  maybe they don't use the MLE.  maybe they trade someone away and let their TPE expire.  maybe they get a DPE but choose not to use it.  maybe they let a fan favorite leave in free agency when they had his bird rights and the player was willing to give them a slight discount.  next year, jokic, murray, mpj are all going to be max scale-ish.  gordon and barton are other substantial contracts, and so is jamychal green.  how much are they really willing to spend?  down the road, how hard will they try to duck below the luxury tax line to avoid being repeaters?  it's going to be tricky if mpj's injuries actually become a big issue."
"Bro that’s actually a stupid argument. Jokic second best player rn is Will fucking Barton lol. MPJ is literally playing 6’ 10 Allen Crabbe rn. On top of that, the refs screwed them out of a game when they didn’t call the obvious foul on Jokic’s game winning shot."
"Mike is shooting 45% on open 3s this year   Barton is on the court and not even looking for anyone besides jokic   What’s the point of trying to barely win games when in reality the nuggets won’t win anything substantial unless MPJ is the 2nd best player   So why not put more focus on trying to get him the ball and get him used to being a ball handler and instead of making him go to the corner and letting Barton who will never be the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th best player on s title team handle everything"
"Will Barton counts too. Do you have any comparison data to suggest what an average number of draft hits would look like?  No, you don't."
"Dude is tripping, multiple post touches where he can’t back down against will Barton. Those ugly ass failed euros. He’s better just sticking to the perimeter . And was it me or was it theis and segun mostly matched against jokic"
Will Barton came back and is taking a lot of MPJ’s shots. Nuggets are better when MPJ is number two man behind Jokic. Malone needs to step in.

"If you watch nuggets games, you’ll see he doesn’t really get enough opportunity. Last year after the all star break he averaged 22 and 8 on 55/45/85 splits and that’s a large sample size of games…   The problem is the expectations changed this year, and Malone still treats MPJ the same way, will Barton gets more touches and plays called for him than MPJ, there’s not a focus on making sure MPJ takes the most or second most shots every night like there is for other second options   So if he’s not even getting the ball as much as he should and he has added defensive attention, how can he really get into rhythm offensively"
Bruh his best player was Will Barton who averaged 16 ppg on 54% TS and didn't even start in 3 of the 4 games  You expect him to beat a red hot CP3 and Book with that?
"Jokic just playing within himself, not forcing shots, passing it out to open guys, Will Barton really hustles"
just tuned in why has will barton taken double the shots of Jokic?
"nah will barton is good so is monte morris and gordon is one of the best defenders in the league  MPJ should be playing better than he has, big regression from him so far this year"
Damn will Barton was the goat fantasy pick up a few weeks ago dude is balling out

Jokic 7/12  Jamal 7/11  Gordon 6/9 nice  MPJ 6/12  Barton 5/13 meh  Green 7/12  Green found his game we need that from him. Millsap finally off the bench and I think his game will do really well there.  Facu does everything that doesn't get stats. Bol was stupid good in garbage time lmao. Defense being so good after the 1st was also nice."
"Will “we’re on a run, time to fuck everything up” barton"
If we post his highlights enough maybe someone will trade him+barton for a good player (please)
No one misses an open layup like Will Barton man. Dude is a pretty good player but sometimes he is so frustrating to watch
"Will ""Can't stop anything except Jokic getting triple dubs"" Barton"
"I love watching this nuggets team, but even when they're popping off Will Barton makes me want to tear my hair out. Dude dribbles for 6 seconds into a bad pass with Jokic right next to him, open. Massive J.R. vibes."
Don’t forget Will “I’m a Starter” Barton chilling in with 12 points on 13 shots
There is no doubt in my mind that Will Barton is the worst player in the NBA.
Nuggets playing well?  Here comes will barton with a hurricane of turnovers and bad defence
"And the nuggets didn’t have Gary Harris, will Barton, and some of Jamal Murray."
We get humiliated in the playoffs this year. We realize malone isn't a good defensive coach a good offensive coach and has weird rotations. We get a guy that draws plays. Murray gets consistent will barton gets traded for a shooter mpj signs a long term contract and becomes an offensive star. Bol bol becomes a defensive center piece. Forget small ball we play tall ball
Paul Millsap is not a solid role player this year. Jamychal Green has missed a lot of games. And Will Barton is pretty much putting up the same stats as Carmelo Anthony but we're forced to start him.
"Don’t forget about Paul Millsap, Will Barton, JaMychal Green, I mean they have quite a few really solid role players. There’s a reason they’re in contention for the conference championship and potentially a title. Portland is Damian’s Band of Misfit Toys and Talent. He sent my entire franchise to the shadow realm, and I still want this man to get MVP. I really don’t understand how people can possibly argue the value Dame has to Portland. He is one of a VERY select few players whose max contracts are actually undervaluing them as assets."
Yes to the Nuggets for Will Barton Bol Bol and a 2nd
"he's a good defender. Nuggets are 15th in defense or exactly average with Jamal Murray, Monte Morris, MPJ, Will Barton, Facu, 36 year old paul millsap and Jamichael Green playing most of the minutes. Jokic is literally the best defeder on the Nuggets other than Gary Harris who has barely played this year."
Thrillsap must be the lethal tag team duo of Will Barton &amp; Millsap
Will Barton was our third best player last year and is mad underrated when healthy. Probs because he jas missed both playoff runs and came out of the gate complete ass this year after that knee injury.  15/5/4 on solid splits with solid D matters. Less against the Lakers than against the Blazers in 2019 obviously. That's a 7 game series that went to the wire multiple times and was eventually decided by a hot Rodney Hood of all people.
Will barton is the x factor lmfao
"Can’t wait for Lowry and Tucker/Bjelica or Will Barton, PJ Tucker, and Bjelica to come to Philly."
I assume it will be Barton or Harris + Picks. Potentially RJ involved too
Will Barton and draft picks is the rumor
"Why do you want to part way with Barton tho? Man can get buckets, and you'll need that because I don't think Murray will go absolutely crazy again.  Why not Millsap?"
No bias here but I'd rather you guys trade Warriors killer will Barton
That was one of the teams I was thinking of when I mentioned NOP as a potential destination earlier. But I just couldnt come up with the right fake trade for them. Like Will Barton and 2 future firsts? Meh. One reason why I was willing to do that offer if NOP was they have so many future picks less opportunity cost. Maybe it is worth it if Denver but idk.   Dallas and Miami I also liked but dont have that much in terms of tradeable assets. Heat rightfully wouldnt give up Herro for him.
This is exactly wrong lol. Drop coverage is where he struggles becuse he lacks the foot speed to play in space with rim rollers or fast guards going downhill to the rim. Hedging is where he has more success because he can use his bbiq and fast hands to get steals/deflections/force the pass away from the pnr action.  The reason we got punished against Utah is because   1.	our two best perimeter defender in Gary Harris and will Barton weren’t available so we were just allowing penetration constantly. Remember earlier when I said athletic rim runners and guards getting downhill are bad for Jokic? Yeah Donovan and Rudy fit the bill lol 2.	MPJ was the one getting most often hunted in those actions since he’s so young and inexperienced as a defender. Last night was his 82nd career NBA game and he missed all of college. Dude has a long way to go to get his nba defensive iq where it needs to be   We did still play some drop coverage against the jazz because we kept trying to change stuff up to see if anything would work. The solution was basically “wait until Gary Harris is healthy.” So we did. And we won.
Is it just me or does Will Barton always seem disinterested in passing it to MPJ lol
"Man the Mavs have some great young talents in Doncic and Kristaps.  Jokic for my money is the best player on the planet when it comes to overall impact, but his talents are being squandered by poor efforts by his teammates.  Barton has been the second best nugget so far and you won’t win games too often if that is the case.  Start of the 3rd will determine who wins this game."
*Will Barton III
Will Barton by a mile lmaooo
Will Barton
Welcome to the Will Barton Experience.  Dude has negative BBIQ.
It's going to be tough to win games if Will Barton can't hit layups and open jumpers. 3 straight misses by him.
"curry for gary harris and will barton, who says no /s"
"I am not sure about that.   I think it would depend upon how high the other team was on MPJ.    Harris and Barton are average players and the FRPs are likely to be in the 20s.    Unless the trade partner believes MPJ will become an All-NBA player, I can't see them trading Beal, KAT or Lavine for that package."
"Barton probably isn't available, as the Nuggets will want to make a real push and their bench has already been weakened. I know he's having a down year, but I think the Nuggets will want to hold regardless. Tucker, Delon Wright, and George Hill are likely gettable- in particular, I think Wright would be a great fit. He's having a career year and is a positive on defense who can playmake. The 76ers have shown they really need a playmaker with Simmons out, and Wright can be that guy IMO."
"I think Orlando would probably prefer ""their own guy"" in a situation like that where both guys value is relatively similar. Barton is weird everytime I watch him this year I dont know what he's doing but last yr he was also their 3rd best player. Whether that version ever comes back Im not sure but I might prefer holding out rather than selling low.   Here's one: Will Barton for Danny Green? Green is old but he's still better defensively than Barton which Denver defensive wings is what I think they need to be looking for with MPJ at the 4 looking set. Green is also an expiring if you dont want Barton's deal on the books next yr.   Someone posted yesterday Ja'Sean Tate might be available, I would make that call if Hou. I do in general think there is a move to be made for Denver, not a blockbuster but I dont think they should be sitting back this yr doing nothing at all. MPJ at the 4 aside I would also call about Larry Nance the fit for Denver is very clean."
"Nuggets: Jokic for sure had it. Speculation that MPJ, Monte Morris, and Will Barton got it."
"Weird that Lowry is on the trading block given how much he means to the org and fans.  While Bosh, TMac, Carter, Kawhi or others may have had a higher peak nobody contributed more to the Raptors winning games over their careers.  Then you see these piss-ant reported trade packages headlined by Will Barton or Tyrese Maxey or Donte DiVincenzo and maybe it makes me wonder how little it's worth to Toronto to keep Lowry around in the middle of a playoff hunt."
"I don't fault the player, I fault the GM for taking him without a good path towards development.  Taking a project like Simons with an existing core of players ready to win now and a full guard rotation was not/is not a recipe for successful development, particularly considering that at the time the Blazers were one of only a couple NBA teams not to have a G-League affiliate.  Simons is extension eligible after this season, so the Blazers are nearing an inflection point regarding his future and will need to decide if they still have time to invest in him.     Pointing to Will Barton proves the point: he sat for so long and didn't really get a chance to help the Blazers, then got traded and blossomed into an NBA player for somebody else.  The Blazers had to move him in a win-now move (which was the right call at the time) but also because they couldn't pay him and his contract was coming up.  All of that investment and development ended up helping a division rival.    Simons is approaching that same situation, and the Blazers are almost out of runway to determine the right path to take with him.  It's about to become a much riskier proposition to bet on Simons' upside, especially given how far he still has to go in his development."
"I mean it's a little harsh, but I generally agree. He was a project when we drafted him, and he's still a project.  For context, Will Barton was age 24 and avging 3 PPG in his third year on Portland's bench.   I think he's still got a shot to turn into a productive player, but it's an uphill battle"
With Will Barton as 2nd best player.
I hate Will Barton.
"I think the question is “are you more scared of the nuggets than the blazers or mavs” not “are you scared of any of these teams.”  I don’t really care how anyone views us in these discussions, but it does feel like each side is talking past one another here.  I will say one interesting thing that I’m looking forward to watching as a nuggets fan regardless of who we play...the nuggets have a history of playing up or down to their competition. Plenty of “bad” losses (swept against the kings this year) but also plenty of resilient wins with our backs against the wall (both 3-1 comebacks, last year winning b2bs against bucks and then flying across the country to beat the jazz with only 7 active players). This team inexplicably seems to do *better* at times when they are short handed or their backs are against the wall. Part of that is sometimes because it forces Malone to play better rotations because his hands are tied (and rotations are *easily* his biggest weakness as a coach) but i think another part of it is that Jokic - and by extension the team - tend to play a bit more loose and carefree, which leads to our best style of ball which is the free-flowing ball movement offense that we have all dubbed “Jokic ball.” There are times when the team tightens up and there’s no movement, lots of bad isos/ball watching etc. This team plays better on both ends when it’s more wild and free. Their defense feeds off of the offense in that regard - everyone is more engaged and switching etc.  After the 3-1 come backs last year, someone asked Jokic about the pressure and everything and he just said [“for us there is no pressure. We just go out and play and have fun.”](https://ca.nba.com/news/nba-playoffs-2020-denver-nuggets-vs-la-clippers-nikola-jokic-says-pressure-is-on-clippers-after-forcing-game-7/60xs046zzyl61fsl26ll1c8zx). It’s a really interesting way of looking at things, and definitely jives with his comments this week after Murray went down about how being an underdog is nothing new to him.  If the nuggets get bounced in their first round series, sure it will be disappointing. But it won’t be that surprising given we would be without Murray and the majority of the chemistry that AG had generated in his short time here was playing off of the Murray-Jokic 2 man game turning it into a 3 man action with Porter and Barton as lethal spot up shooters. Especially if it’s against the Lakers, who most would consider the favorites if healthy (at least the favorites to take the west, if not the title favorites). Given that, the pressure might be on the other team to close out the nuggets without Murray."
"Right? It’s Will Barton, not Jamal Murray, and you’re helping off Jokic. Will Barton isn’t going to pull up from midrange and your guard fought through the screen fairly well and you have help side that can come over. He 100% needs to communicate what to do there and honestly just bluff at Barton to slow him down a split second and start recover to a closeout on Jokic. Instead he got stuck in no-man’s land."
Sometimes you get Will The Thrill and sometimes you get Billiam Barton.
"Nuggets without Jokic: MPJ, AG, Will Barton &gt; Warriors without Steph: Draymond, Wiggins"
Barton surprises himself every moment he's on the floor. What's gonna happen? Will he be good or miss 6 shots in the first and sit the rest of the game? Absolutely unpredictable lol
"Will barton is my new favorite player, he's just so fucking unpredictable"
"will barton truly is the most enigmatic player, is he going to hit all his shots in a quarter? is he gonna make the dumbest dribble with 30 seconds left on the clock and possession? you never know"
WILL THE THRILL BARTON
Will Barton: king of the yolo
How about Bol Bol and Will barton for Smart?
I see your offer and raise you Will barton and Bol Bol.
"Sick. Brewer was also on the receiving end of [one of the greatest forgotten blocks ever](https://youtu.be/TLgKVouiBsQ) (also features an alley-oop finished by a young Will Barton, and a still-spry Wes Matthews running the floor)."
"is it? just looking at old drafts i see guys like draymond green, khris middleton, spencer dinwiddie, will barton, jae crowder, jimmy butler, jerami grant, joe harris, malcolm brogdon, josh richardson, pascal siakam, dillon brooks, kyle anderson, etc, etc.. who were picked late that definitely improved from their rookie year to later career, and some of them were older when they were drafted too. dudes who prove themselves to be nba material will usually make some strides early in their career as they adjust to the speed and physicality of the nba. plus, having million dollar contracts on the line is a good incentive to hone your skills. i think the problem is that not many people in the 2nd round are nba material to begin with.  if youre talking about ""jumping tiers"" uhh sure, i dont think bane will be an all star, but there's enormous variance in the value of non all stars. if he can be even a top 100 player in the nba, how is that not a steal?  like half of the top 10 in a lot of drafts are busts.   also grayson was bad his rookie year, ask any jazz fan. true shooting percentage is 10% higher now with more volume and he can actually play defense. 40 pt game came on 11/30 shooting."
"Ben Simmons was an all star and is a DPOY candidate and currently a better overall player then Murray.   Tobias Harris was a fringe all star, very good defender and one on one player, and currently a better player than mpj.  Danny green and seth curry are both better players than will Barton.   AG has been in Denver for 11 games and they are 9-2 in that stretch."
"Will Barton. The mistakes he makes are really loud, and what he does well is harder to spot. He’s an important piece for the Nuggets, but our fanbase just rakes him over the coals anytime we lose."
"Uhhh let's see. You said Tobias should've made the all-star game but Murray is averaging more PPG than him on higher efficiency. Michael Porter Jr currently has the 11th highest TS% in the entire NBA this season. Will Barton and Danny Green is also arguable. Danny is the better 3pt shooter and team defender, but Barton is the better man defender, and also handles the ball and can create his own shot."
[Yes RIP the Will Barton DPOY campaign](https://twitter.com/knarsu3/status/1204878641756327940?s=20) had a good run.
"I remember last season when Will Barton had like a +4.00 DRPM for half the season lol  His DRPM for the entire season currently sits at +1.01, so either Barton had a oppositely ridiculous decline in DRPM over the second half of the season, or ESPN made major tweaks to the formula again."
"Uhhh let's see, Simmons made the all star game and is a DPOY candidate, Murray... not so much.   Tobias should've made the all star game and is a great defender, MPJ has been more efficient but wasn't close to all star like production in the first half of the year, and while improved defensively is not nearly as good there as tobias.   Danny green and seth curry are both better players than will Barton.   And AG has been on the nuggets for 10 games, and they've gone 8-2 lol."
"I think AG can get that role, he's decent playmaker. Also Barton can get some assists. Not expecting from MPJ this season to be that good playmaker, but will see. He was basically catch and shoot player at the beginning of the seasons and look at him now."
Y’all want Will Barton for Jimmy Buckets? Let me know.
"MPJs role on our team is finisher/scorer/rebounder; and he does his role at the highest efficiency level seen in decades for a 22 year old.  We have Starters in Jokic/Murray/Barton that all facilitate to Gordon/MPJ finishes.  Even our bench is stacked with facilitators Morris/Facu/Dosier when we stagger MPJs minutes.   With Murray going down, Facu Campazzo is an all world facilitator and will back fill that role.    It is however MPJ that must pick up Murray's scoring and THAT is the real challenge before the Nuggets."
"One word keeps playing in my mind as I watch quietly in the background this NBA season. Disrespect. Disrespect for Hartenstein's game, his skill, his impact. People treating him like he's not a NBA caliber player. People thinking rookie's are better than him. It's all so very disrespectful. Let's make one thing very Clear. Hartenstein will make the Hall of Fame. He is that GREAT.  **THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOT PLAYING AND PLAYING BADLY.**  For young players it doesn't matter how many minutes you get, it only matters what you do with the playing time you do get. Hartenstein in his career has only played 6 games over 20 minutes. In those games he was 5-1 with a plus minus of +88. The last time Hartenstein played 20 minutes in a game Hartenstein had 17/15/1/2stls/5blks shooting 89% from the field in only 26 minutes of play. Hart was a +39. Now, I want to put that specific stat line in perspective. For one, it's the only time in NBA history a player put up at least 17/15/5blks/2stls on 89% shooting, but more than that, it's the +39 that is unreal. Jokic's career high plus minus is +38. Hartenstein in 26 minutes put up a higher plus minus than Jokic's career high. But it's not just Jokic. Lebron's career high plus minus was also +39. Think about the greatness of Lebron, his longevity, his dominance. Think about how many absolutely terrible teams Lebron has played over his career. Only once was Lebron as dominate from a plus minus perspective as Hartenstein that night.  If this was only a one time thing I wouldn't really care. Many players have fluke historic games. Booker dropped 73, Cory Brewer and Terrence Ross dropped 50. I'm sure if you look though history you will find plus minus performances better than Hart and Lebron's career high. But here's the important detail. It's NOT a one time thing. Hartenstein is constantly a positive helping his team win games. This season **Isaiah Hartenstein leads the Denver Nuggets in net rating.** Not Jokic, not Murray, HARTENSTEIN. When Hartenstein plays the Nuggets are WINNING. The Nuggets are 7-1 when Hartenstein plays more than 11 minutes. Hart is a +64 in those games.  So the obvious question is HOW? How is it Hartenstein is leading the Nuggets in net rating? From a eye test prospective he's been struggling. One word my friend. **DEFENSE.** Requiring at least 25 games played **Isaiah Hartenstein leads all centers in defensive rating.** Hart is averaging 3.3 blocks and 2.1 steals per 100 possessions. Hart is the only player in the NBA that averages 3+ blocks and 2+ steals per100 possessions while being positive in the plus minus. To put those stats into prospective, Kevin Garrett only Averaged 3 blocks and 2 steals per 100 possessions once in his NBA career, the year he won MVP. Isaiah Hartenstein leads the Nuggets in net rating because he's currently playing defense at a similar level to MVP KG. [quick highlight of what I'm talking about](https://streamable.com/n5spcy)  **In Hartenstein Prime he could win DPOY.** That said I'm not sure this level of defense will keep up. This level of defense is probably a simple a flash of what Hartenstein could become defensively. Kind of like how Jokic showed flashes of averaging triple doubles when he was 22-23 years old. We might see some regression defensively, but any regression defensively will be more than compensated for what Hartenstein will give the Nuggets offensively.  Hartenstein has been in a horribly timed shooting slump, Hart is shooting just 53% at the rim (he shot 79% at the rim last season), the game is still fast for him. However Hart will improve dramatically with playing time. I know this because it's not the first time Hartenstein has been in a shooting slump in limited minutes. When Hartenstein played with the Rockets, in the games Hart played less than 15 minutes he averaged per36 11/6/1stl/1blk shooting 51% from the field. Hartenstein struggles when he doesn't get constant playing time. Because **Hartenstein never gets constant playing time**, all people see are the struggles. They don't see what happens when he gets playing time. In the Games Hartenstein played more than 15 minutes he averaged per36 17/16/2blks/1stl shooting 75% from the field. When Hartenstein gets playing time he does the same thing he did in the G-League. Dominates.  The main thing that prompted this post was the last two Nuggets games I saw back to back. The Nuggets played the Grizzles and then Played the Mavericks. One game Hartenstein played, the other game Hartenstein didn't. Jokic, Barton and MPJ played great in both games, Murray Struggled in both games. one game the Nuggets won, the other they were blown out. This back to back was the perfect microcosm of Hartenstein's value as a player.  Hart was the only bench player positive in the plus minus during the Grizzles game, he had 2 blocks and 1 steal in 11 minutes of play. Hartenstein had a defensive rating of 65 in that game. The Nuggets couldn't hit anything, Murray shot 7% in the game, Campazzo was missing open threes, Dozier was 1 of 6. Jokic was coming out after the Grizzles hit an unbelievable deep three to cut the lead to 4. When Jokic came back at the 6 minute mark, the lead was still 4. Nuggets end up winning by one point. Hartenstein didn't take a shot during that stretch, but what he did do is contest every shot, he got deflections steals, blocks. Hartenstein didn't foul. If the Grizzlies went on a run during that stretch jokic was out the Nuggets would have lost. As such **Hartenstein play won the Grizzlies game**  Comparatively, The Nuggets played a back to back against the Mavericks. Malone choose to go with the 20 year old rookie Nnaji instead of Hartenstein and that decision lost the game. Now understand Nnaji is a good player, he can put the ball in the basket and I think he will be in the NBA for a long time. But he is not ready for NBA rotation minutes without Hartenstein or Jokic backing him up. In the Minutes Nnaji plays without Jokic or Hart the Nuggets are -30 net rating. Again Nnaji is good, but he's a rook and he plays like a rook. In this Mavericks game, once then Nuggets put in Nnai the Nuggets gave up layups. So many layups the Nuggets lost the momentum and by the time Jokic came back in the game he couldn't stop the bleeding. The Mavs are too good to not play Isaiah Hartenstein.  So where do we go from here? I want to give advice to 3 people. Malone, Nuggets Fans, and Hartenstein himself.  **For Malone:** I want you to know that I love you. I love your coaching style and I respect you. Truly. Both Jokic and Hartenstein were second round picks, but you gave Jokic a real opportunity to show his talent. You said ""I wouldn't trade Jokic for anybody in the world"" when Jokic was a rookie. Without that opportunity you gave Jokic I don't know where the Nuggets would be. Hartenstein didn't get that opportunity, he was instead sent to the G-League. Hartenstein dominated the G-League, he was the youngest G-League finals MVP in history. His reward for playing great? getting cut. So my advice to you Malone is nothing crazy, just play Hartenstein the same minutes you would have given Plumlee. Hartenstien is not Plumlee, he's much better. But still, that's all he needs. Plumlee never played less than ten minutes, never play Hartenstein less than ten minutes. Let the Young player grow.  **For Nuggets Fans:** Have patience. I understand that Hartenstein doesn't look the best right now. I understand he fouls a lot, I understand he is shooting really bad at the rim. But the Numbers don't lie. When Hartenstein plays basketball the Nuggets are a better team than when Jokic plays basketball. That is not an opinion, that is a fact. MPJ had a 0/8 shooting game, he's still a clear STAR. Hartenstein is the same age as MPJ and should be treated with the same level of understanding. The fouls will end, the finishing will come, and Hartenstein Greatness will begin.  **For Hartenstein:** I believe in you. At times it must feel like no one does. Like no one understands how versatile and great you can be. **Don't give up.** Keep working, keep grinding. Your time will come. hopefully with the Nuggets but if not, that's fine too. Isaiah **YOU ARE GREAT. YOU ARE AMAZING. YOU WILL WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS**"
Wdym his team was without two of their beat wing defenders in Gary Harris and Will Barton playing Donovan Mitchell
"so you just really dislike Will Barton? He was arguably better then Murray last season before he got injured. And hes a great locker room guy. Jury still out on Beasley there and Grant just really wanted to be a 1st option. He wasnt benched in the playoffs, he was a 3rd option"
i think you are having a hard time comprehending that malone stuck him on the bench behind will barton all year...it's hard to fathom i understand  *he only started in the playoffs because will barton was injured*
"if they weren't willing to pay 20m for grant, then they should never acquired him - i think anyone that watches the nba could have told you that he would get at least that  but by all accounts they seem to have offered him the same money detroit did, so it seems like you are misinformed  jerami most likely left because he didn't enjoy playing 25mpg off the bench behind will barton in his contract year"
"Will Barton has a player option, but if he took it I would keep him protected"
"He has a very similar guarding profile to Dame - ideally the weakest perimeter player on the other team. But more flexible to taller players if that's the least dangerous matchup. I had a look at their top-15 respective matchups (based on [NBA tracking data](https://go.nba.com/bo3c)) by minutes played last season.  I can give you a more detailed breakdown if you want one, but to avoid an even longer wall of text, here's a summary (these are sums over the top-15 defensive assignments for each, positions from wikipedia):  * Luka spent 34:29 on PGs, 40:55 on PG/SG, 11:53 on SGs, 27:43 on SG/SF, and 52:36 on forwards who aren't even part-time guards. That is far more time on only-guards at 86:17 minutes compared to 52:36 on only-forwards, or about 64% more time on only-guards than only-forwards. * Dame spent 55:38 on PGs, 43:33 on PG/SG, 31:46 on SGs, 10:56 on SG/SF, and 36:21 across three different forwards who aren't even part-time guards. More time on players who are never-PGs than only-PGs. * Cory Joseph, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges and Will Barton -- five players -- appear on both top-15 lists, despite differences in numbers of games played against different teams and injury absences. A further four players couldn't appear on both lists as they were teammates of one of them. * Both players guard a very similar profile of players - relatively weak perimeter offensive players, a number of whom spend a lot of time spotting up in the corner. That's what high-usage PGs who are not great defenders do, that's usually their assignment, because this way they don't accumulate defensive fouls (foul trouble would limit offensive production of the whole team) and it allows them to rest on defence while a more competent perimeter defender chases the opposing PG around screens. The only difference is that one is taller so the coach maybe has more flexibility in picking the more suitable guy to guard.  Also, this ""you are what you guard"" concept is a mess of a circular argument. But even if that is applied, Luka is certainly more of a guard than a forward. And since he's a guard, he's also clearly playing at on-ball/point rather than off-ball/shooting guard."
"Gary Harris, Will Barton, Bol Bol, 3 firsts and a pick swap"
"The team is ELITE with Jokic on the floor.  Well yeah, Jokic makes players around him better!    They went full rebuild mode before the actual rebuild! They failed to trade Gary and Will Barton a few seasons ago. They are also allergic to 3 - D players.... but The FO loves their guards! They got so many guards!?"
"I'm not even a denver fan and watching Will Barton thinking hes steph curry must be so frustrating lol. Even when we played against them in the playoffs in '19 he was trying to outshine everybody, realistically a reason why we were able to take them to 7"
I do like Hartenstein's hustle a lot he will never give up on rebounds or loose balls.  And yea Plumlee as a scorer aint it but thats also a small issue with the gameplan imo. As a facilitator he was pretty good in his time with Denver. (Admittedly in the bubble he played very very poorly).   I think MPJ coming back and Barton moving to the bench will be a nice addition for the bench.
"I'm just wondering what the hell is going on w/ the Nuggets? Jokic's insane play should be making the game easier for his teammates. I guess MPJ being in COVID protocol forever b/c he refuses to quarantine properly, plus Will Barton thinking he's the shit, and Gary Harris losing his shooting will do that to you. Millsap's still pretty good but old af. And losing longbois Craig and Grant didn't seem to help.  Hopefully Monte Morris and PJ Dozier take a huge leap this year. I'd really like Jokic to win MVP this season, or at least come in 2nd."
Will Barton is about where i'd expected
Jokic keeps surprising me that man Ia a chunky basketball deity and if we had s better record I'm sure he could be mvp. Campanazzo has also been a great surprise he brings a lot of energy defensively and has some of the sickest passes i have seen in a while.  Disappointed pretty much everyone else from the team Jamal murray has struggled offensively more than usual i don't expect him to be bubble murray but at least 20 consistently. Will barton last year was one of our best players and now looks washed in some games and we haven't gotten back his defense. Mpj is good at basketball but a moron and is suspended for not following the covid guidelines for about two weeks. Gary harris is not being phenomenal.
"Anyone interested in will Barton? Great ball handler, shooter scorer, was in the dunk contest, super selfless player"
Will Barton is singlehandedly losing the nuggets games and it’s making me sad
"""bigger role"" here doesn't mean what people who're throwing it around think it means  he played 25mpg off the bench behind will barton and millsap all year  he only started in the playoffs because barton was injured"
never forget michael baloney played this guy 25mpg off the bench behind will barton
"&gt; And I think we can somewhat see the defensive impact of the Nuggets not having him anymore.  The irony of the Nuggets situation is that he went to the Pistons even tho Nuggets matched b/c he wanted more offensive touches. Who knew he'd probably be getting more this season (unless Malone were to be stubborn for no reason) because MPJ doesn't trust science enough to stay out of COVID protocol, Will Barton sucks, and Gary Harris can't seem to regain his shooting touch. Had he stayed, he'd probably be the most reliable 3rd option, and maybe 2nd option on some nights when Murray's having an off-night. With the amount of dimes Jokic is dishing out he would've been feasting cuz these other fools can't score or in MPJ's case, can't even play b/c he'll probably be stuck in COVID protocol purgatory forever."
"Those guys are mostly 3 and D that are content in their roles, except maaybe THJ. On the other hand, MPJ and Will Barton want/need the ball in their hands or playmake to be effective and/or maximize their skillsets."
"I don't think the Nuggets will give the Lakers any problems. They got closed out in 5 last year and quite frankly got worse this off season. Grant's value in a vacuum is outweighed by his being basically the only wing defender they have. If Barton is healthy that helps, but it doesn't make them better than they were last year when they were no match for the Lakers.   Clippers to my mind remain the Lakers' biggest threat. They have the personnel to guard AD and Lebron, and have a ton of offensive fire power. I think the Lakers are better because Lebron, but I'm not writing them off because they choked in the bubble (I kind of refuse to hold anything against any team for what happened in the bubble)."
Murray's been okay but really passive so far. Will Barton has taken on a bigger role with grant gone and MPJ out and destroys our flow when he's on the floor
"Shh, rotoworld writers will tell you Barton was a key piece of the Nuggets success all this years."
PJ Dozier and Will Barton making the critical decisions.  You hate to see it.
"Will Barton needs to be gone from this team. The fact he went public at the beginning of this year about wanting to be a ""starter"" is honestly such a joke. Dude is not a winning basketball player."
because he's will barton
when has will barton not taken those shots
Why is Will Barton taking that shot
Jokic told will barton to FUCK OFF
After Will Barton missing Jokic
Who knew all Will Barton had to do to be a starter was just let MJP treat COVID how's he's been treating it since the pandemic started
I came here to criticize will barton but he picked up 2 early fouls and has only played 3 minutes smh
"Jokic if you watch, is getting fucked by the nuggets utter inability to defend perimeter drives. Every other play he has a guard coming down hill full speed as he tries to defend the dunk spot and the drive. Only a few guys in the league can succeed like that.   In last night's game, Will Barton played a fantastic defensive game, and it showed mostly (when Barton went out in the 2nd the wolves got everything they wanted on drives).   If our perimeter guys could ever stay with their man, you'd see a lot better interior defense too."
"You can thank Will ""I'm a starter"" Barton and Gary ""Gary Harris"" Harris for that."
I was at the Nuggets-Warriors game in 2016 when the 14-24 Nuggets beat the 36-2 Warriors. Darrell Arthur and Will Barton of all people put up like 40 off the bench and the Nugs were just able to stave off a loss as Steph heated up and went nuclear in the 4th. Such a fun game.
Will Barton is a not a Nuggets legend but he's a Nuggets hero. Dude's been a part of the entire development of this team so I'm really hoping that he gets back to form
No. More like we trade will Barton and Gary Harris for Lebron (please)
I hate watching will Barton play basketball
"Losing wiggins would be a huge blow. Without any exceptions. One of the teams would definitely take him. You need to have a minimum in cap space and most contracts are either completely worthless (will Barton for instance) or too low for them to make the value. This leaves players on albatross deals as the best options for the expansion teams. Wiggins, Harris, Griffin and Westbrook would be the best players available I suspect. Seattle would take westbrook probably but out of the other 3 you would probably take wiggins given his contract is 10 mil a year smaller."
"Blazers and nuggets have a similar issue: if you can't stop/slow/mildly bother anyone at the point of attack, it doesn't really matter who is defending the backline.  For y'all it's your starting PG/SG, for us it's anyone not named Gary Harris and occasionally Will Barton. Murray is coming along tho!   Once guards and wings get deep into the paint, it's usually only a matter of time until a bucket"
"lmao I noticed that too, I think it's Will Barton but I'm not sure"
"Will ""I'm a starter in this league"" Barton  He is 6moy for teams who play vs the Nuggets"
&gt;Guards and wings who are really good rebounders are pretty underrated in the modern NBA.  See the nuggets sub trashing Will Barton every year while he outrebounded every guard on the roster and a few of the bigs.
"If Malone really leans in to what he saw with 4 other players that are cutting/making space (Facu/Morris/Murray/Green), Jokic will easily end with over 10 assists a game. Or if Barton/Harris remember how to hit shots."
No they don't cause he's a negative on defense. Will Barton is also coming back from injury. If he was shooting .377 from the field those other games we would have one in less than 7.
More like will Barton stop being such a donkey ass
"Per Bleacher report the tenth best small forward might be Bogdan, Ingles or Will Barton.  9-11 best point guards are CP3, Donovan Mitchell and Kyle Lowry.  Given the relative scarcity of wings and our overreaction to a couple of sub-par playoff performances PG is among the more underrated players around."
Supporting Will Barton... yikes. Anyone with any basketball knowledge can see he hurts the team. Stay being a homer and crying about Ls
"He doesn't know how to play when he's coming back from injury and not in great shape. He still thinks he's prime Kobe and will iso into 3 defenders to put up a shot and not even consider passing out. And he'll do this over and over again, even while literally sharing the court with THREE point guards (Morris, Dozier, Campazzo), a lineup which has seen heavy minutes so far.   Barton is a pretty good 3 pt shooter. He could try to move off ball and get himself open from 3, and occasionally get a clear lane to drive. Sort of like how Millsap plays now that he's not as athletic, which has made him incredibly efficient. Instead, Barton dribbles the air out of the ball and completely destroys our flow offense. He's actually pretty good at this hero ball stuff when healthy, but right now he's unplayable until he changes his play style."
"Just stop. Barton and Harris are definitely the main culprits in the bad start (with an assist to Malone and Grant's last minute journey to DET).  BUT Will Barton is coming back from injury and was our 3rd best player last season. He's been trash thriugh 5 games but there is at least a 60/40 chance he regains form. And even if he doesn't, he doesn't deserves the blind hate.  The person you should be pointing fingers at is Gary Harris who fell off a cliff 2 FUCKING YEARS AGO and is basically the new Nick Anderson while making 20m a year."
will Barton gtfo
"To be fair to the Wolves the box score really doesn't tell the full story. The wolves came back from double digit deficits twice in this game and it was close until the 4th quarter where Gary Harris and Will Barton aka the brick bros didn't play. Jokic just pushed the pace in the 4th and the Nuggets got hot from three and I think after the first score by the Wolves the Nuggets went on a 15-0 run. But GG to the wolves, had KAT been there I think the Wolves could have blown the Nuggets out in two quarters."
Meanwhile Gary Harris and Will Barton continue to suck ass
Will Barton? More like Can Barton gtfo
# I urge for people to have in mind that he plays with Will Barton as a teammate.
We don’t want or need Gary Harris and will Barton.
"Monstars stole Gary Harris offense, will Barton has Timothy luwawu cabarot ability with Jordan mentality."
Will Barton?
Will Barton is the only answer
"Will Barton and Gary Harris who were our 3rd and 4th (ish) guys last year have been playing absolutely terribly. Bricking wide open threes and missing easy layups. Hopefully they'll get their shit together. We also lost two of our important wing defenders in Grant and Craig, and don't really have the personnel to make for it. I think we should trade some offensive guys for some defensive wings and guards, and hope jokic can shore up the offense."
"Nah, Will Barton and Gary Harris just have to play better.   And the bench has to figure it out."
Guys like Gary Harris and Will Barton have been dogshit
"Gary Harris is really bad and plays too many minutes. More of his minutes need to go to PJ Dozier.   Will Barton handles the ball too much, he's a good player but plays for himself and doesn't know how to get others involved.   Perimeter defense is bad. We give up a ton of open 3s. I don't have the exact stats to back this up, but I guarantee we give up the most corner 3s."
"Both teams are in the same boat at the moment.  Denver look terrible offensively without Jokic on the court. For Denver, Murray, Monte Morris and MPJ have had periods where they have been excellent.  For Denver, Gary Harris has been ok defensively but awful offensively. For Denver, Will Barton, Milsap, P.J. Dojier have oscillated from Okay to unplayable. Green has looked good in short spurts for Denver and probably deserves more minutes.  The Raptors barely look like an NBA team without Lowry. For the Raptors, Boucher &amp; Van Vleet have had periods where they have been excellent. For the Raptors, OG has been good defensively but his offense has been iffy. For the raptors, Siakam, Powell, T.D have all oscillated between okay to unplayable. For the raptors, Matt Thomas has looked good and should get more minutes, especially when the raptors has periods where they can't hit a 3 to save their lives.  But overall as things settle down, I thing the Nuggets will be fine because Jokic's facilitation has been sublime. If Gary Harris and Will Barton stop missing open shots/layups they will be fine.  Really worried about the raptors, especially, if Siakam can't get back to an all-star level"
Can I interest you in Gary Harris or Will Barton?
"I feel like that shit is fine for team subreddits, but in here it can get way too confusing. Like for example if someone said WB in the nuggets subreddit it would be easily recognizable as Will Barton but here in r/nba most people would be confused."
"JaMychal Green(who was out until the suns game), PJ Dozier, Will Barton, and Hartenstein those four are not getting it done right now maybe they’ll turn it around but they are not near the level of production that Grant, Plumlee, and Craig were providing for the team especially defensively"
"I don’t think so. He would be a great pf next to jokic. He’s already a better defender than mpj ever will be. And lord knows we need it. Jokic and Murray are both poor defenders, Simmons is an all around talent. I’m fine with keeping mpj and I love him but like our team looks like ass on defense. Realistically I would like to see a Barton or Harris trade. But I know our front office hasn’t done it for the last 2 years that there have been rumors and Gary Harris is worth a bag of rocks now, with his contract. I’d also like the nuggets to figure out the backup center position, jokic has to play 38 minutes for us to be competitive, it’s kinda sad"
Gary Harris &amp; will Barton
Millsap or Will barton maybe?
"“starter” will barton with 2 points in 36 minutes, really making his case for that position"
"He wasn't good in the regular season.  And he has serious flaws as a rebounder and playmaker. But he was solid in the playoffs.  More importantly, he filled a role (switchable wing D) that the team BADLY needs even if you don't take into account that Barton, Sap and Harris (who have been 3 of our 5 best players) since 2016 (and were both considered top 70 guys at one point) are a complete mess at the moment.    So basically, if we suck-- no I don't think he will be the sole reason. That would be an idiodic take. But I did view his depature as likely to drop us a tier out of being a real contender... and now it's looking like it might have actually been two tiers.  I'm also not sure what trade we can swing without burning through assets specifically bc Harris contract is suddenly borders on being an albotross amd if Barton doesn't find health than his becomes a negative asset too. And they are basically the guys we have to move $$$ and CBA wise.  I'd add that if the growth in Grant's game sustains than it is also an indictement on Malone's limitations as a coach (see the fact that he is struggling to incorporate MPJ as a 3rd weapon) and so in that sense I don't neccessarily blame Grant.  But I also think the anger of Nuggets fans is also understanable because it seems like no matter how was built the team is, NBA players bolt the first chance they have. With the notable exceptions being Gallo and Monte during a LONG history of this being the case."
"I am sure even Jerami Grant had no clue he was about to be given the chance to be first option on a team. Free agency is just that - it's **free** agency.        Your front office should have extended him when you traded for him. That's the risk they ran with rentals. Once Barton sorts out his health you guys will be fine, you can always swing a trade if needed too."
"“Will Barton is nicknamed Thrill for a reason....”  Yeah, because his first name is Will and “Willenium” was already taken."
You’re insane Will Barton is almost worthless at this point in his career
"Absolutely not, Will Barton &gt; Tobias Harris"
"Gary Harris is the new Nick Anderson, Will Barton looks like he's still hurt, and CP3 is still the clutchest player in the league"
"Man, what is wrong with the nuggets. Was jerami grant that important? Or is it something to do with will barton and gary harris being absolute trash"
"This dude Will Barton complained about not starting, got the start, and has 0 points in 24 minutes lol"
it's one game on our home floor. getting barton back will be big for them and jokic probably will play better than this on average.
"Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Hopefully Barton can comeback. Jokic’s midrange game seems off to me recently. They were always tough shots, but he would make them more often than not. Hopefully tho, suns don’t have a lights out 3 pt shooting game as well, but as you say Nuggets aren’t the best defensively.   Maybe Rivers will start lighting it up like he was earlier. Cant always count on Austin Rivers tho lol"
Too early to tell while win's few minutes away. Denver will adjust and welcome back Barton at some point. He's another potent offensive player.
I mean barton can at least lead the bench when jokic sits so we can do more than mpj pick n rolls. we will also be able to throw out 15 second Barton isos 😎
Will Barton and PJ Dozier!?!?!? Noooo please don’t send them! I’m so scared guys
Reggie said Will Barton is reinforcements LMAAAO
"Dude for real this team with Murray (and Barton) healthy is certainly a lock to take home the title, what a shame   Given how the players in Denver feel about the management/FO, and given how young they are, I think this Denver team will be scary for at least the next 5-10 years"
Will Barton wouldn't be this trash by a long stretch
Monte Morris doing his best Will Barton impression tonight
A lot still. Barton will come off the bench for the first two games back for sure
How many minutes will Rivers get when Barton is back?
"Yep, him, Jamal Murray and Will Barton. I thought there were murmurs of Barton coming back a few games ago but still no go. I'm amazed how well we're doing."
Him and Will Barton are hurt
No return in sight for Will Barton?
"The problem for porter is that he can’t dribble so he really can’t be that perimeter presence that Murray is, nor can he attack the rim like Murray. Campazzo takes playmaking duties from Jokic when needed but he can’t get his own bucket. MPJ can take scoring duties when needed but he can’t control the offense. Murray is the perfect middle.  Murray isn’t what campazzo is but he’s become a positive defender this year.   The beauty of Murray-MPJ-Jokic is that each has something the other lacks so it makes it impossible for defenses yo focus on any one but also makes the role players effectively free. Once MPJ develops his handle and his strength that he can play in the post or attack the rim off the dribble then he passes Murray as a player. Unfortunately, even without Murray, he’s not developing in that way because the playoffs aren’t a good environment for him to learn that. Probably in a year or 2.   But yeah Monte us stepping up in that Murray role, Camp is adding good D, Rivers has been unexpectedly consistent and stable. I think with Barton and PJ, the nuggets are near net sans Murray’s explosive scoring. Denver’s inability to attack the rim from the guard spot will become more apparent against Ayton IMO."
"I feel like with a healthy Barton, the rotation depends on the situation at hand.  If they need guard defense, (which they will for this series. CP3 and Booker is a stronger duo than Dame and CJ), then they go with Facundo Campazzo and Will Barton. If they need guard offense, then they'll go with Monte Morris and Austin Rivers."
He also wouldn't have wanted us to trade Will Barton.
"It will be close for sure, whoever wins it will be in 6-7 games. Like you said, I think we are slight favorites, especially if CP3 is healthy. Now if Murray and Barton were playing my outlook would be far different. Nuggets would be the best team in the west imo"
"People didn't factor in just how much better Nuggets got with the addition of Aaron Gordon.  Whatever they lost from Jamal Murray/Will Barton is made back from Aaron Gordon, and Austin Rivers miraculously turning into Steph Curry in Q4's."
"Yea the Warriors can’t afford those guys. But Dallas can. So then it comes down to the reason  KP is more valuable: his position. It is far more difficult to replace a capable scoring big than a wing.  How many bigs average 20 a game in today’s game. Hell how many average 15?! (And can shoot). Then drill down further, how many will be available?  On the contrary, Wiggins gives you 18 a game as a *2nd* option. But that’s bc Klay is out. Wiggins is NOT gonna be anyone’s 2nd option on the regular. So that 18 is more like 13-15. PLENTY of guys can give you that, plenty that are or are possibly available: Derozan, Dinwiddie, Fournier, Trent Jr, will Barton…"
I'm not 100% on this but I believe Barton and Dozier will both be back this series
Barton should be playing in game one! Obviously will be limited but it’ll be good to have him back
To clarify: Will Barton would get a contract I’m thinking around 20mil Gary would be getting around 15 and cam around 10mil. And from then on 11-15 players would get minimum
One other thing to watch is Barton is close to returning. I assume he'll play a bench role as he is just coming back from an injury. How will this affect Monte's stellar play so far in the playoffs?
Will Barton regressed this year but last year he was our second best player for large portions of the season and was straight up better than Bogdanavic at everything but scoring last year. Also we didn't have our only guard defender (Dozier was barely in the rotation then) to defend Donavan so stop being a smug POS like it's guaranteed you win.
Dame still sad they gave up on Will Barton.
The Nuggets/Suns series will be interesting.  The Nuggets will terribly miss Barton in this series. He's a good match-up for Booker IMO.
"yup. goal is to first, re-sign Powell as our starting SG, trade CJ, Nurk  and Covington for PG13 and Zubac.  Dame, Powell, PG13, Collins (lol) and Zubac.   I’d take that team over any iteration Lillard has ever had. Except maybe that 2014 LMA, Batum, Wes, Rolo with CJ and Will Barton off the bench team."
Bias take but the Nuggets playoff experience and getting a healthy Barton and PJ will be game changers. Nuggs in 7
"It’s hard thinking about the talent we were willing to give up over the years. Wes left, then CJ came off the bench. CJ broke out, then we let will Barton go. We let Connaughton go. We had Seth Curry off the bench. He’s got greener pastures. Then we lose Hood and Trent Jr for some help on the wings. But damn. Simmons will break out as a SG in the absence of CJ, but damnit if we didn’t have enough talent to sell high."
Yeah aka when he started playing professionally. I was actually following them when they had Will the Thrill Barton in 2012
Will Barton who Dame loves from his time as a Blazer and probably overrates tbh
"The Nuggets didn’t have Jamal Murray, Will Barton, and PJ Dozier and the Blazers still lost. That’s their 3 best guards."
They didn’t have Will Barton or PJ Dozier either
Will Barton is shit talking Portland at home in street clothes; the Trailblazers are in a very bad way right now 😔
Why is will barton dressed like any random guy you’ll find in Miami
Will Barton dressed like Sisqo
Will Barton is cute af tho
You mean Will Barton lol
Will Barton dressed for Cancun already...  Bad juju
What the fuck is Will Barton wearing?
Will Barton dresses like he thinks he’s the best player on the floor at every given night
Wtf is Will Barton wearing lmao
Somebody tell Will Barton to button up his shirt
I miss Will Barton
Barton should be back next series . Hes very close and he will help a ton.
Did you really just call will Barton good?
"Imagine if the nuggets had Jamal Murray, Will Barton and PJ Dozier...this series would be over already. Blazers go full rebuild if they lose"
"When will PJ and Barton return? Howard, Campazzo and Rivers are doing way more than expected, but Denver needs those guys."
"If you're worried about Shaq Harrison and Will Barton to make the difference for your team, you aren't winning a ring. Period."
"Addition by subtraction. You have TOO many like-players. Even worse it’s a combo of young guys and vets. So the young guys will naturally defer to older guys, and/or the coach will lean on the reliable older guys, when really the young guys should get minutes and a chance to shine and make mistakes. So along those line…  Put the ball in Tyler Herro’s hands. In the modern game, yea, he can run point. Similar to Jamal Murray. And similar to Jamal Murray, remember just a few years ago when Gary Harris(and to a lesser extent Will Barton) were seen as interchangeable with Murray? Harris was more stable, older, but Murray had the upside. Denver finally took off when that was cleared up.   For the Heat they have like 2 or 3 ‘Gary Harris’ guys. Dragic, Nunn, even had Avery Bradley. They need to trim some good players and give Herro big minutes. He is their highest upside player. I refuse to believe it was just the bubble. I think it’s the glut of guards, him deferring a little, him playing off-ball, and the fame overwhelmed him   Lastly, trade Jimmy Butler. As someone else pointed out, he has value to a contender. This is your last chance to get value for him   In my best case scenario for Miami:  -Trade Jimmy Butler to Atlanta in sign and trade for John Collins    -Let Goran Dragic walk, or sign and trade to a desperate contender for a projected late 1st (Philly, LA, Bucks)  -Let Ariza walk  -Let Iggy walk   -Sign Nunn on a friendly deal but do NOT overpay. He’s not THAT good. Move him to 6th man   -Re-sign Oladipo. Prove it deal   2021-22 Lineup  Herro   Oladipo  Robinson   Collins    Bam  6th man- Nunn  -Pat Riley and thr city of miami will be enough to sign the remaining guys. Your lineup is thinner, but you have better hierarchy and pathways for 3 guys to become stars (herro, Collins, Bam)  That ‘5 guys who average 15 a game’ blueprint has never worked"
"Anything can happen in a 3 game series between talented teams, but at this point my guesses would be Clippers, Blazers, Suns will win  Nuggets gonna really have to hope that Barton comes back and shows up like crazy, because they were really banking on just exploiting Kanter bench minutes. And now he's out of the lineup."
Will Barton and PJ Dozier on the nuggets have been out for a about a month with groin injuries
"Ahh Kanter is being scape goateed for everything at this point. He played like 5 minutes game 3. Jokic was hot no doubt, he’s also the 3rd best shooter in the entire league outside 15 feet since the shut down last March on over 515 attempts. Hopefully he gets hot again game 5.   Barton coming back will take some pressure off, and get him some easier looks perhaps."
Barton back for game 5 will be a big boost. Looks like that will happen from what I read.
they should give will barton the bag so i can hopefully enjoy nuggets basketball again
"I think they may play them together some. Facu plays hard and does some good stuff, but 2 months ago we were wondering if he would even be in the playoff rotation. He really struggles to score, so we aren’t getting very much out anything he runs. Teams just drop 5 feet under his pick and rolls, and he is even less of a threat to score at the rim or in the mid range. We have also been playing Marcus Howard an undrafted rookie who didn’t play outside garbage time until like a week ago 10-15 minutes a game so Barton taking those minutes will be a boost as well. However Barton plays it will be a big boost having him out there imo."
"Absolutely it will. He is a really good pick and roll player and has great chemistry with Jokic. If a Jamal/ Jokic is our best play, a Barton/Jokic pick and roll is our second best. He also is really good at getting his own offence. Basically two things we are desperate for. Anyone who can create any sort of offence off the bounce and someone who can run an effective pick and roll.   I guess it depends how many minutes he is going to be extended for. I would like him to share his minutes with Jokic. Not trying to trash Dame and CJ but it’s no secret they are small and not great defenders in isolation or pick and roll. Having Barton able play 20 minutes and be able to attack them in pick and roll would be a huge boost."
I heard Will Barton is coming back. Do you think he'll make a significant difference? Any idea who he replaces when he returns?
Barton will be big for you guys. He's fucking fearless.
Damn having Will Barton would be so huge
"you have the best playmaker in the league but you run the offense through facundo campazzo instead  just another year in michael baloney's career, somehow topping playing will barton over jerami grant last year"
"Yeah real ones know what Barton brings to the table, no Barton slander will be tolerated"
"I love Will Barton with all my heart, how fucking dare you"
"Man it reminded me how spoiled we are with our crunch time free throw shooting. Between Jamal, Jokic and occasionally Will Barton, shit's usually automatic"
I fucking hate this cursed ass season. I wanted a Lakers rematch with a consistent Murray and superior mpj but we don't even get to play will Barton
"If they had both Murray and Barton, Portland will just get embarrased for 4 straight games."
"Ikr, every series lost they had they always had an excuse, Dame, CJ, Jusuf injured. Now against Nuggets without Murray and Barton and everyone on Portland healthy? What's the excuse now? Slotts? Lol they really need to accept that their current roster will never be good enough. Jeez their biggest achievement is getting swept at wcf yeaaaaars ago."
&gt; Denver entered the season with one of the deeper guard rotations in the NBA. &gt;  &gt; PG: Jamal Murray / Monte Morris / Facu Campazzo / Markus Howard &gt;  &gt; SG: Gary Harris / Will Barton / PJ Dozier / RJ Hampton  Dude read even just the first few sentences
"Text from the article:  As the bus carrying the melancholy Denver Nuggets rolled down Highway 101 toward San Francisco International Airport on that Tuesday morning in April, Jamal Murray sat in a seat with his left leg propped up, wiping tears from his eyes.  Across the aisle was his head coach, Michael Malone, and an impromptu therapy session began.  The night before, Murray's left knee had buckled after he'd planted on a drive toward the basket. Malone was at his side on the ground within seconds, waving for help from the medical staff. Later, inside the locker room at Chase Center, Malone was there when the Golden State Warriors team doctors informed him of their diagnosis: torn ACL.  ""Jamal was grasping the enormity of the situation and was asking himself all those questions. Will he recover? Will he ever be the same?"" Malone says. ""What I've learned in my years in basketball and what I've tried to bring to our team for the last six years is that when you face adversity, you cannot run.""  Malone has become known for a few things during what is now a two-decade-long NBA career. One is for his intensity, whether it is dealing with officials, opponents or even his own team when it's time to demand accountability. Google ""Michael Malone rant"" and there are plenty of results from meltdowns about his players' defense to the NBA's rules on letting families into the bubble last year to the LeBron James-Michael Jordan debate.  Though he has a good sense of humor and a New Yorker's sensibility and sarcasm, when Malone is upset, he sets his jaw and digs in emotionally and with his work ethic. When things aren't going right, he has been known to barricade himself in his hotel room or office and plow through the process to figure it out.  Malone's tenure in Denver has been marked by his ability to do just that. Like what he did on the bus that day in San Francisco. And what he did at the first team meeting after Murray's injury was confirmed by an MRI: leading his team through turmoil, something the now veteran coach is making a trademark.  ""I came into the meeting with Jamal's stats and I read them off. All the points, assists, 3-pointers. I wanted everyone to know exactly what we were going to be missing,"" Malone says. ""That 24 hours was very emotional for all of us. But I needed to let the guys know that none of them were expected to be Jamal. They didn't have to play outside themselves. But what they had to do was be positive. To have good body language. To believe in themselves and their teammates. That is what good teams do.""   It was the same type of resilience the Nuggets displayed last year in Orlando, Florida, where they twice came back from a 3-1 series deficit to win and reach the West finals.  ""This team's resiliency is a direct reflection of Mo,"" Nuggets team president Tim Connelly says, calling Malone by his nickname. ""We've haven't had many losing streaks in the last six years. We've responded well to tough times. A lot of credit goes to him.""  Malone is at it again, trying to chart a path for the Nuggets to get through their opening-round series with the Portland Trail Blazers. The injuries in the backcourt -- in addition to Murray, the Nuggets were down Monte Morris (who has since returned), Will Barton and PJ Dozier -- have left him starting 30-year-old rookie Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers, who just a few weeks ago was signed by the team on a 10-day contract.  ""Stay positive,"" Malone says, almost as an instruction to himself. ""We are consistent with that. We do that every day no matter who is out there.""  Malone is quick to credit his players, especially Jokic, for the team's ability to follow that mantra over the past two seasons. But while Malone hasn't gotten the attention as other successful coaches have -- the Nuggets have a .625 winning percentage over the past four seasons and are trying to advance in the playoffs for the third consecutive season -- his team has developed a reputation that he has spearheaded.  His career has been highlighted by working with superstars early in their careers. Malone was with LeBron James in Cleveland for five years as an assistant and was part of the effort that transformed James into a willing defensive player. He was the lead assistant in Golden State when Stephen Curry took the leap between 2011 and 2013, overcoming ankle injuries to morph into one of the league's greatest offensive weapons of all time.  And he has been with Jokic since day one, overseeing his development into what will likely be the third MVP whom Malone has impacted.  ""When Nikola was at his first summer league with us, there wasn't one person in our group who thought he'd be an NBA starter,"" Malone says. ""But with LeBron and Steph, you see they have great basketball IQ and they have a great work ethic. Their IQ is off the charts. That's what you also see with Nikola.""  Malone acutely remembers flying home from Dallas after getting blown out in early in the 2016-17 season and talking himself into building the team around Jokic, whom he had been trying to shoehorn into the lineup next to fellow big man Jusuf Nurkic. Within weeks, Nurkic was traded and the team's turnaround began.   Four years later, the turnaround looked to be nearing its apex. After a March trade for Aaron Gordon gave Malone defensive versatility he hadn't had in the past and unlocked a leap for Michael Porter Jr. on offense, the Nuggets promptly went on an eight-game winning streak, looking every bit like bona fide title contenders.  But the Murray injury lowered their ceiling and possibly set that dream back -- and not just this season, as Murray is likely to miss much of next year. And with just one year left on Gordon's contract, it's unclear when or even if the Nuggets will ever get to see what that collection of players could become.  ""No excuses -- that's what we believe,"" Malone says. ""And that's why I'm so proud of this team."""
"Marcus Morris, Jokic, Will Barton, Bol Bol, Paul Millsap  0 bias"
"Nuggets were 11th in defence. I think starting unit is pretty good defensive if they actually got to play more than the 100 minutes before Barton and Jamal got injured. Or at least mote than good enough with how good offensively they are. They were destroying teams before Jamal went down. +42 in 100 minutes or so.   MPJ is not a bad defender is average, and does some things very well. Weak side shot blocking, rebounding and will probably only improve. Jamal is actually pretty decent defender."
"Dame got hurt after the Blazers were down 0-3.  Westbrook wasn't injured and even if he was, people call him a negative player anyways.  Will Barton missed the entire playoffs. The Nuggets made the WCF without him.  You can argue the finals injuries sure. But the Lakers were heavy favorites before that series started and the injuries happened.   Moreover, a starter for the Lakers, Avery Bradley, didn't play at all in the bubble. Ad got injured during the finals. And the Lakers lost their homecourt advantage for the playoffs. The bubble hurt the Lakers more than any other team."
"haha, so true. he's probably wearing a Will Barton jersery with no t-shirt beneath and headband and replica shorts along with a $200 pair of LeBrons. all while calling the players entitled assholes under his breath"
I don't know what you are on about.   Most Nuggets fans will be rooting for one of Portland or Phoenix should you all advance. And also expected the Blazers to win this series due to Barton + PJ being out in addition to Murray. The convos over @ Denver Stiffs have typically been very cordial and there are Blazers Edge peeps who regularly swing through.   It just so happens that A) Nuggets fans definitely feel like the Murray injury robbed us of a title run and that we would be clear favorites if fully healthy B) your team has two of the three most despised ex-Nuggets in Melo and Nurk (the other being Iggy).
Barton coming back game 3 tho hopefully. That will be a big boost.
Will Barton and PJ Dozier are injured. Technically they are forwards but the team is really just Jokic and 4 other guys currently.
Will Barton isn't consistent even when he is healthy
"I'm with ya man, you can't be that bad at defending the PnR and consistently go deep in the playoffs barring some miracles. Jokic/MPJ might be the worst defensive starting 4/5 in the league. And sure, you can upgrade at the 3 and the 2 (with AG and Dozier/Barton) but it's not like Jamal Murray is any good at defense either. That's 2 really bad defenders, 1 bad-to-okay defender and then 2 good-to-great defenders that basically all guard the same ""wing"" type of player. Denver will continue to get smashed by PnR's until the end of time."
"If Nurkic is about to set the screen Gordon should switch over, and the other players need to rotate. Porter shot poorly from 3, and the Campazzo &amp; Rivers guard plays are going to be rough with the mins they are going to play. To me they need Barton and Dozier to be healthy to slow down Portland guard plays. I think it is a shoot out, and Michael Porter will be put to the test to be efficient."
"The year after the next is 2022-23 right? It’s hard for me to say Denver because of their cap situation that year.   Aaron Gordon, Will Barton and most importantly MPJ’s contracts will expire after the 2021-22 season (the odds are however they extend MPJ’s contract before he hits free agency). Then you have Jokic eligible for a supermax extension that same offseason which is going to take up a lot of cap space as well. Thus their cap puts them at a really difficult spot that they’ll eventually have to let go of some of their key players, so it’s a bit hard for me to pick Denver."
"That’s what I mean about the Nurk comment. He’s just saying that to like get in the zone or some shit, but by no account were they actually underdogs. They weren’t in the majority of sportsbooks because the Nuggets are completely crippled by injuries.    Those ESPN talking heads can be all over the place, wasn’t following them, but I know that Vegas has the Blazers from the start. If we had one of Barton or PJ it would be even, if we had both of them and no Murray we’d be favored, if we had Murray and neither of Will/PJ we’d be favored, and at full strength like the Blazers are we’d be overwhelming favorites. But with all 3 of those guys out, forced to start a player who wasn’t even in the NBA last month and give 30 mins to one of our end of bench garbage time guys, we just don’t have much we can do. They can still win but they shouldn’t be favored and haven’t been."
crazy that betanthony davis is still in after 2 timeouts playing like a 6'11 will barton
"Markus Howard was taking shots like he was Curry, he has to chill out a bit 😂. PJ is confirmed out for the series pretty sure. But Barton coming back will be huge for you guys."
&gt;Will Donovan  a combination of Will Barton and Donovan Mitchell
"I think we will see some more traps. I think the team was gun shy to trap the way the rest of the team was shooting. I agree the rotations obviously have to be better and people need to get run off the line. Off the top of my head I can think 3 or 4 totally blown rotations leading to wide open 3s. It needs to get tightened up.   At the end of the day Denver is going to have to live with some open non corner 3s from because they are going to need to bring that 3rd guy in the pick and roll sometimes. How much may decide the series. Offensively lots of room for improvement from Jokic’s supporting cast. Barton coming back if he’s healthy will be a series changer, along with PJ hopefully."
"Well, yeah. We lost Murray and Barton and our long guard from the bench PJ Dozier (who would be super useful against your team).  That is a lot of fire power. It is like you losing Nurkic, Covington and Kanter, and having Harry Giles, RHJ and Melo be front court against Jokic. That is where we are now against Dame. See without all that shooting power and length your team can play very relaxing defense and save themselves for offense.  Our championship hopes went away with Jamal, and our good playoff run hopes went away with Barton (even if he comes back in a game or two, he will be rusty) and PJ.  I hope we are healthier next year."
"&gt; It’s just bad in general because Nurkic and Kanter can make things tough for Jokic. I don’t see anyone slowing Dame down or making anything tough for him this series.  Nurkic can't be put in the same sentence as Jokic. Jokic scored at will. 34 points, on 52% shooting. That is not a ""slowing down"". The thing is they didn't try to make Jokic score only 20 by doubling him. That would have opened up space.  Also, Denver was 1/10 in passes from Jokic in the game. If they hit 3-4 more shots from those...  As the other Denver fan said, Nurkic is to Jokic the same as Barton is to Dame."
"You’re right but also way to confident/conceited for playing a team that’s missing Jamal Murray, Will Barton, and PJ Dozier who would add defense to the second unit. It’s pretty lame talking shit against a wounded animal and y’all still might lose. Blazers franchise is at a sad point tbh. Dame will never have a ring and he deserves one because he’s amazing, but clowns like you make the team unlikable."
"for someone who's said ""bye"" more than once you still seem to be hanging around an awful lot.  You acknowledge that my comment was a joke &amp; yet you are taking this awfully seriously, as if highlight threads on r/nba have been a bastion for civil &amp; enlightened discourse at any time in recent memory.  The point is that perhaps you should lighten up and feel free to scroll on at any time.  Despite trying to attack me for being a ""casual"" and for somehow stereotyping you based on your flair, you seem to be more than willing to do the same thing back to me.  It seems like really you have an axe to grind &amp; took offense to me not living &amp; dying with the Bucks, which is insanely weird.  Did you ever stop to think that my comment about cellar teams in the NBA was pointed more at the Kings/Bulls/Hawks years of Jabari's career?    Since you want r/nba to be a shining beacon of intelligent discourse, how do you feel the Nuggets did tonight against the Blazers?  Do you think Jokic will be able to score enough to punish the Blazers &amp; force them to double so he can pass &amp; really unlock what makes Denver dangerous?  Do you think that MPJ &amp; Aaron Gordon can create enough offense to make it easy on Jokic and draw enough attention to even up the series?  Does Denver have anyone that can help Jokic punish Portland's PnR defense and expose Kanter?  To me, isoing Jokic against big bodies like Nurkic &amp; Kanter may not work, getting those guys moving &amp; into rotation and hitting the smaller Portland guards with screens seems like a recipe for success.     At face value it seems like Facu &amp; Austin Rivers won't have nearly enough to offset what Dame &amp; CJ can do, but maybe if Will Barton comes back they'll have a better shot.  The real X-factors will likely be whether or not Monte Morris can be healthy enough to give the Nuggets anything and how long Portland can survive with Anfernee Simons on the floor.  How do you feel about his development in general?  Do you think he's worth extending this summer?"
"I used to like Will Barton.  I still do, but I used to to"
TBD. Barton probably closer than dozier.  I agree that it will be hard to win without one of the two. With both of them I personally would feel pretty confident.  Be interesting to see if shaq harrison gets any run.
Yea millsap was a big factor. Will Barton was a big part. Sure you don’t say the positives.. Murray was already a budding star. The teams are pretty even and injuries are just part of the game.
Honestly will Barton has always been mediocre against us. Murray the only one I think would’ve made an actual difference
Mpj can make those tough shots that no one else can. You are right about the shot creation though. Monte I agree with as well. I think with Barton back it'll be tough on Portland which will open up the offense some more.
"Jokic is missing a near all star, starter in Will Barton and a key defensive bench piece in Dozier. No one else can fucking score apart from MPJ and Morris"
I can't stand people that can't put aside their egos for petty shit. I had a boss named David. Not Dave. Never Davey. C'mon man. Be a real one.   Plus his rotations are shit. He would have given Will Barton some of Jokic's minutes to get him up to 48.
"Yea our backcourt doesn’t have enough and it was pretty concerning tonight. Hopefully we can get Barton back and that’ll help but not gonna hold my breath.   It was heartbreaking to see Murray not out there playing tn. He had so much energy on the bench you know he’d be going 120% if he were.  I do think MPJ will produce this series, just had a rough night."
"It’s a makeshift unit with all of our guard injuries. There’s gonna be some bad decisions and some lack of cohesion.  How do you think the blazers would look if dame, CJ, Simons, and Covington all went out and your guard/wing rotation was just Norm looking around at a bunch of guys signed off of waivers? Gonna look a little disjointed, right?  That’s what it’s like without Murray, Barton, and dozier with Morris just coming back from injury.   Porter takes some questionable shots for sure, and he really dialed that up to 11 near the end there when he was pressing even harder, but I think he will settle in as the series goes along. But the guard situation is going to be fucked if we can’t get Barton or dozier back."
Will barton
Sign Nerlens and Will Barton
"so you didn't actually play any healthy teams last year except maybe the nuggets, weren't they missing will barton tho  amazing selective amnesia when it comes to your own victories"
I'll always be happy for Barton. Loved his energy when he was with the Memphis Tigers. He could be erratic at times but that's why he's Will the Thrill!! Much love
"No scorers and almost no chemistry. Before you had Will Barton and Monte Morris off the bench who are both facilitators who can score, now they're in the starting line up. Now you have Campazzo, Rivers, PJ Dozier and two Greens. That's not bad on paper but that means the main playmaker is Campazzo who's great at passing but isn't a scoring threat so NBA defenses can easily play around his weaknesses.     If Bones keeps playing as well as he's playing, he could potentially be the 6th man in his rookie season which is unprecedented for Malone. Nuggets fans are all for it."
Shout-out Will Barton. Great tiger. Glad he's having a good start to the season.
Being outplayed by Will Barton
"Probably Brandon Roy leading the comeback against the mavs in the playoffs. We didn't win the series, but that gane was awesome and Roy carried us even though he was hobbled. After that it's Dame's buzzer beaters in the playoffs. Then that awesome play from trob and will barton."
SGA &amp; Will barton exist. Reggie Miller was skinnier.
This was mentioned during the Nuggets game last night - Only 2 guys averaging at least 16/4/4 with 50% shooting. Ja Morant and Will Barton
He’d start over Kent bazemore or Trevor Ariza and they were a top west team and probably will be. He’d start over will Barton too if you don’t wanna accept the warriors.
"Clutch game-winning save from Will the Thrill Barton.  Granted, our shooting was poor, so maybe could've prevented that situation in the first place.  Let's play Bones more, thought he looked confident out there."
Will Barton III for the Nuggets too
"The real answer is that his shooting is off because they are trying this new curl action that requires him to be more of a ball handler than he naturally is. But his defense, rebound, and all around game has actually improved quite a bit. So if he figures out how to accurately pull up while curling around a Jokic screen he will be deadly. If not, he will probably go back to being the third man and either Barton, Gordon, or Bones will take the second role in the offense"
"What, last year? We were not only missing the butter to our bread, but we we were missing Will Barton and PJ dozier. We were starting rookie Facundo Campazzo and out of the league Austin Rivers. The year before that we did go to the wcf."
Will! Barton!
More like Will Barton said no. That block was unbelievable.
Will fucking Barton my goodness what a block
"As do many other teams though - luck always is a part of it. Like last year, the Bucks were lucky that KD's feet are big. The Suns were lucky to face the Lakers with LeBron halfway to broken and AD broken after 3 games, followed by the Nuggets with Barton coming back a bit too soon off a pulled hammy + no Jamal Murray, followed by the Clips with no Kawhi.   So the Clips would need luck of some stripe to reach the Finals, indeed. I would not pick the Clips (even healthy) over the Nuggets though, for instance, if the Nuggets are healthy and they were to meet at any point in the playoffs. Bledsoe can't shoot, and the Clips literally still don't have an answer for Jokic. Simple as that.   But honestly I don't think it will come to that. The Clips without Kawhi for (lets be charitable to him / optimistic he gets back sooner than one would expect) 80% of the season probably don't win enough games to be more than a play-in team. We've seen Kawhi go slow in his rehab though in the past. There's no reason to think he'll push himself hard to play in the regular season and if he doesnt I just think they'll miss the playoffs, if not by a lot. He's locked into his contract for years to come anyway, no reason to risk it."

I LOVE will Barton hes my favorite non blazer ever
Will bArton is relentless and it’s great
"doesn't seem sustainable lol. but stealing game 1 on the road is huge, you can tell Nuggets are missing Will Barton a lot because he was the only other player running the offense well when Murray went out"
"I gotta ask again, will Will Barton and PJ Dozier be able to return for this series?"
"if Jokic plays well and they lose cause Rivers is in protocol, Barton is injured, Dozier is injured, Monte is hobbled   people will get jokes off cause that's what they do, but no one is actually doing to care"
"Denver is matched up so poorly against the blazers. They brought in aaron gordon to defend 3-5, i.e. to help defend lebron, kawhi, pg, because their fromtcourt was weak defensively. But blazers' offense comes primarily through their guards, lillard, mccollum, and powell. And denver's guard rotation just got ravaged by injury, so now you have literally just campazzo trying to guard two great offensive players. Even if he does decent on lillard, which is hard, they'll have no one to put on mccollum. And if you double lillard, which you probably will have to, it's gonna be rough. Powell and mccollum will make that hurt.  And the kicker is that the problem isn't mutual. Portland's biggest problem is lack of defense in the backcourt, and now denver has no offensive threats in their backcourt. And portland's best defenders? A power forward (covington) and a center (nurkic) while denver's offense will need to run almost entirely through jokic.  It's a testament to how good the nuggets are that the odds are still 50/50. The loss of murray and barton makes this matchup look so bad on paper. Aaron gordon becomes useless, campazzo is trying to guard three people, nurkic will do about as well as you can expect someone to do on jokic...it's tough."
"The Blazers have played really good recently. Definitely true that they have been the luckiest team, their record shouldnt have been anywhere near what it was when Dame was singlehandedly clutching wins out of his ass for the first part of the season without Cj and Nurk.   Its a different story now and over their last 12 games or so they have the best net rating in the league.   Nuggets are missing Murray, Barton, Rivers and Dozier (who is very overlooked and underrated, Denver's best perimeter defender)  It just might be too much for the Nuggets, i mean they will be playing the early games with Shaq Harrison/ Markus Howard on playoff minutes at the guard spots. One is an undrafted rookie and the other is a two way contract who wont be egligible for a two way even after this season."
"Dozier is our backup 2 guard, and with Will Barton out he was our starting 2 guard. I'd call this series in 5 if he was healthy."
"MPJ has a higher ceiling but he's not as proven as Murray. And if MPJ does pan out and becomes a perennial all-star, I think they just keep them both and get rid of a role player like Aaron Gordon or Will Barton."
same with R.J. Hampton! Jared Jeffries and Will Barton
"I love Will and the hate he often gets from portions of the fanbase is disgusting.  That said, Barton often struggles upon return from injury because so much of what he does is dependent on the slither inherent to his game. In fact, his finishing at the rim as never really returned post-knee injury.   All of this to say, we badly need his 3 point shooting but I also worry that it's gonna be a shell of himself that shows up to play the Blazers and it's gonna cause flashbacks to our 2019 series.   Also, we badly need PJ to get healthy. Best defender on the team IMO."
Dame name dropping and praising Will Barton every chance he gets is wholesome af
Dame never said that Jokic should be MVP. He said the MVP would be on the floor.   He was actually talking about Will Barton
"I dont know about will barton, but the nuggets extended bol bol‘s contract sometime this season until 2022.. It was kind of under the radar, but too me it was a clear sign that they see potential in him for the future."
Probably Bol Bol and maybe Will Barton (hopefully not)
"I love irrational shooters like Dillon Brooks, Will Barton, THJ, etc."
"That is true, don't know when Dozier and Barton will return but I do expect them to return by the playoffs start in a week."
Wonder how much adding Will Barton could change that equation. He seems to be hinting online that he will make his return soon.
"Oladipo was solid that year, and he only averaged 2 fewer PPG than MPJ has this year. Lower efficiency, I’ll grant that, but he’s a smaller guard so lower efficiency is expected and the Thunder also had Kanter averaging 13/8 on 20 MPG. Ferguson wasn’t on the team then; you’re probably thinking of Roberson, who admittedly wasn’t very good. Point is, the 2016 Thunder had at least three other solid players on that team between Oladipo, Adams, and Kanter.   Jokic also lost Murray and Will Barton in April, and his game didn’t deteriorate at all.  It’s a debatable argument I’m making to claim current Jokic &gt; past Westbrook, but I think you’re disregarding a couple of solid role players on that Thunder team simply through forgetting about them. The Nuggets are deeper this year than that Thunder team, but not so much as you’re claiming, especially since two of their better players got hurt in April. I think Jokic’s much better efficiency makes him better, but to each his own!"
"It's definitely going to be a problem, as you said you can only slow dame and CJ down so much.  Monte and Barton should be back for the series which is big for our offense. I dont think Dozier will play which is a bummer since he is probably our best perimeter defender.   Can't wait for the series to start! It should be a good one!"
"You are seriously overrating Will Barton, the guy has a PER of 11.  Also 70% of MPJ's FGMs are assisted, I have doubts that he'd be able to carry a team to a play in slot.  Y'all serious underestimate how much better Jokic makes his team."
"Monte is back, but not at 100% yet, but he will probably be during playoffs. Barton and Dozier will come back, maybe before the series, maybe during it, we don't know yet."
"That was amazing reminds me of a Blazers play quite a few years ago, with a Thomas Robinson block to Claver, then to Wes Mathews for an alley oop to Will Barton. One of the greatest plays I’ve ever seen."
"We kinda are playing with house money tbh. Murray is out, who knows when Barton and Dozier will be back- it's been a pleasant surprise how well we've done in spite of that."
That’s not true because Murray isn’t coming back this year. Neither Lebron nor AD are done for the season. Will Barton is also hurt.  And I have no problems with Denver winning ever.  Edit: and MPJ had Covid for a month
"Barton and monte morris (who hopefully will be making an appearance in the playoffs), dozier being injured also sucks"
"Third leading scorer Will Barton, 2nd string shooting guard PJ Dozier"
Will Barton from nuggets. I'd trade that guy for a biscuit
"Nuggets with Murray were a threat to win the title and beat anyone.  Without Murray, I think it will be hard to win the title, but still a threat to upset anyone in a series.  Lakers are still a tough matchup for us, though.  Also, really depends on if we get back Barton and dozier. And if Morris is 100%. Playing these past few weeks without our top 4 guards has been…interesting"
"I think you’re probably right about Dragic staying unless there’s a Lowry to Miami situation. Then I think Dallas could be next on his list.  All these projections won’t mean anything until we know if JRich opts in or out. Even with the way he’s played this year, I doubt he opts in, but you just don’t know. I think Will Barton could be a good replacement if they value a wing over a guard, but I that depends too on what they think Brunson can do next season."
