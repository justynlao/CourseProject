"They still are bad enough to be a lottery team, a guy like Scottie Barnes/ Kessler Edwards would be a good fit"

And all the jokes instead of actual discussion. Wonder if him or Kessler Edwards will get some run in the regular season.
"Nets have some young guys I’m excited to see. I really like Dayron Sharpe, Sekou Doumbouya, Cam Thomas, David Duke, Kessler Edwards, and obviously Nic Claxton. I might be missing someone but they have really exciting young players you’ll see tomo"
"the only players that were not at media day, from my count was Kyrie Irving and Kessler Edwards \[2 way contract\].  You can assume those Two are the only ones not vaccinated or out for ""personal reasons""."
"Shooting specialists shouldn’t go that high in the draft. Much like unskilled bigs, there is a huge cost (a lottery pick) for a role you can fill 75-90% of with a second round pick, mid level or minimum free agent or a UDFA. If you want to draft a shooting specialist, trade back to the late first/early second and draft Trey Murphy or Kessler Edwards plus these guys have more athletic/defensive upside. Or just pick up Joe Wieskamp or Johnny Juzang as an UDFA"
I know im real late but im a big fan of kessler edwards as a deep sleeper
And who could forget about Georgios Kalaitzakis and Kessler Edwards legendary battle last night.
How you gonna add Kessler Edwards and not our 2 first round picks lol
Nets.   They literally need an entire 2nd Unit and all they’ve done is re sign Griffin.   * Harden - Carter? - ??   * Kyrie - Cam Thomas? - ??   * Harris - Kessler Edwards? - Alize Johnson   * Durant - Griffin - ??   * Claxton - Jordan - Day’Ron Sharpe?   That is not a good roster so far.
Kessler Edwards and Sharpe are great pickups. Cam Thomas is a really good player and a really bad fit. Hes not that good off ball and with KD Harden and Kyrie hes going to need to be
"Cam Thomas is a pretty god-awful fit for the Nets atm, since his only value is as an on-ball scorer, and the Nets already have 3 of the best in the NBA at that.   Day'ron is kinda weird because he's not actually a good defensive player or defensive rebounder. The entirety of his game is pretty much offensive rebounding and passing.  I think there's a way he ends up working out, but it's not super clear in my head.  Kessler Edwards is a great fit and value at 44.   I dunno anything about Raiquan Gray besides that people enjoyed watching him in college."
Kessler Edwards looking down at his dribble in the promo is not ideal
Here's my mock draft  1-Pistons-Cade Cunningham  2-Rockets-Jalen Green  3-Cavaliers-Evan Mobley  4-Raptors-Jalen Suggs  5-Magic-Scottie Barnes  6-Thunder-James Bouknight  7-Warriors-Jonathan Kuminga  8-Magic-Moses Moody  9-Kings-Franz Wagner  10-Grizzlies-Josh Giddey  11-Hornets-Jalen Johnson  12-Spurs-Alperen Sengun  13-Pacers-Davion Mitchell  14-Warriors-Chris Duarte   15-Wizards-Trey Murphy II  16-Thunder-Isaiah Jackson  17-Pelicans-Corey Kispert  18-Thunder-Keon Johnson  19-Knicks-Usman Garuba  20-Hawks-Jared Butler  21-Knicks-Ziare Williams  22-Lakers-Ayo Dosunmu   23-Rockets-Kai Jones  24-Rockets-Jaden Springer  25-Clippers-Cam Thomas  26-Nuggets-Charles Bassey  27-Nets-Day’Ron Sharpe  28-76ers-Kessler Edwards  29-Suns-Bones Hyland  30-Jazz-JT Thor
12- Alperen Sengun 41- Kessler Edwards
I think everyone will say Moses Moody should’ve been a top 5 pick looking back at this draft. Josh Primo and Kessler Edwards are my pick for steals.
"Josh Primo, Ayo Dosunmu, Kessler Edwards, Charles Bassey"
"I wonder if there's any play to get Orlando's 5th for FVV (and parts, if needed).  If going on full retool with OG seemingly being your senior-most starter, something like the following is MASSIVELY intriguing :  Raps hold onto their 4th  Raps trade FVV to Orlando for the 5th  Raps trade Siakam to GS for Wiggins, Wiseman, 7th &amp; 14th  Raps draft Suggs with their 4th  Raps draft Barnes with their 5th  Raps draft Bouknight with their 7th  Raps draft Sengun, Kai Jones or Garuba with their 14th (or trade for 14th for assets)  Aim for two of Wieskamp, Vrenz, Queta and/or Kessler Edwards with their 46th &amp; 47th  That is a bold as fuck - and probably very stupid, impossible and misguided - attempt at a rebuild that I honestly wouldn't mind seeing given we just recently won a championship and I don't see FVV or Siakam (as much as I love them) moving us beyond a treadmill team for the next few years.  Let Wiggins slide into the lineup for a year or two while starting Suggs and Barnes alongside OG and develop the hell out of Bouknight, Wiseman and Sengun until they're all ready to compete as one unit.   Total fantasy and probably bad fantasy at that, but I wouldn't hate it."
"I feel like teams are getting WAY smarter. The top-20 is usually now littered with guys who you are pretty sure are going to have an impact (aside from stupid talented 18 year old freaks like Mo Bamba).  Examples of this - Huerter's jump in 2018 (long and elite shooter), Cam Johnson, Desmond Bane jumping to the 1st round, Herro's jump, Clarke's jump, etc. I feel like teams are really emphasizing skill and NBA-readiness more than ever before.  Guys like Bol Bol, Nassir Little, Darius Bazley, Kevin Knox, KPorter (he panned out), Hamidou Diallo, etc. all saw big drops in their draft stock from where they were projected by general media  I think we see some guys like Corey Kispert, Kessler Edwards, Joe Wieskamp, Trey Murphy, etc. go before super ""talented"" guys like Keon and Kai Jones. I see Kuminga taking a big slide as well."
"Patty Mills, Paul Millsap, Lamarcus Aldridge, James Johnson, Javon carter, D’andre bembry, Sekou Doumbouya, Cam Thomas, Day’ron sharpe, Kessler edwards is a massive upgrade on Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Alize Johnson, Luwawu-caberet, Reggie Perry"

"Just look at the other names on the list. I'm on here every day and watch nba games literally every day and play fantasy every year.   I have no idea who Jay huff, Sekou Doumbouya and Kessler Edwards are. Obviously defensive win shares has some glaring flaws."
