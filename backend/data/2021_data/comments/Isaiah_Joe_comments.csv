I’d love to see Isaiah Joe get minutes he looked pretty good when we had covid issues
Isaiah Joe
wouldn't hate seeing some Isaiah Joe minutes
"He’s my favorite target for the Sixers this year, I think he would seriously kick them up another notch to being a legit contender.  We can cobble together the salary with Danny Green + back end guys (Poirer, Scott, Ferguson, etc.), and then it comes down to the actual assets.  I’d start with Matisse and a 1st as the base, but I don’t think that gets it done. The Sixers likely wouldn’t want to give up Milton or Maxey, but I think either makes it enough for the Raptors. Does Isaiah Joe/Korkmaz and a high 2nd (we have the Knicks for this year) push it over the edge? I don’t know, probably not.  It’s tricky cause Lowry’s really good, but is also very old, and expiring. The expiring matters less to me since I think he’d happily resign in Philly, but it makes his value hard to pin down. I’d be curious to hear Raptors fans opinion on it."
Isaiah Joe is good but let’s pump the brakes.
"He was never snubbed... here are all the diff PGs in the NBA that made a All Star game during Conley career (2007 - present) whom were BETTER than Conley when they made the All Star team or where playing equally as well, but played in the East...  West - Nash, Tony Parker, CP3, Steph, Westbrook, Dame, Kidd, Deron Williams, Iverson  East - Kyrie, Rose, Rondo, Deron Williams, Arenas, Billups, Kidd, Joe Johnson, Iverson, Wall, Teague, Isaiah Thomas, Kemba, Dragic, Trae Young  Only these 4 guys can you even argue that MAYBE Conley was more deserving than, but again all these dudes played in the East...  Devin Harris, Mo Williams, Joe Johnson, Jrue Holiday  Sooooo, yea.. never snubbed... never really deserved it. All Star is best of the best... not best solid consistent players"
"danny green, mike scott, maxey, isaiah joe and all our picks who says no"
"PG Isaiah Thomas/Tyreke Evans   SG OJ Mayo/Jimmer Fredette   SF Lance Stephenson/Michael Kidd-Gilchrist   PF Joe Johnson/Larry Sanders   C  Greg Monroe/Andrew Bynum     Guys, I have idea what this team USA could look like"
He says *taking shape* but it appears only him and Isaiah Thomas have been announced. Can't seem to find anybody else announced (other than the coach - Joe Prunty). Does anybody know if there's more information on this team?
Isaiah Thomas. Joe Prunty.  What-Year-Is-It?.png
I’ll give you Isaiah Joe for Kyle Lowry
"no doubt. I was sad to see Isaiah Joe lose time, he may end up being a better 3 &amp; D guy than Kork. time will tell"
We need some Isaiah Joe minutes
"Isaiah Joe only shoots threes, same with Matisse. That's two players on the Sixers alone, so there are dozens of others in the league.  Either way, true shooting percentage helps take into account the 3 points is one more point than 2 and how often a 3 is attempted versus 2."
"They still have shooters like crazy. Curry, Danny Green (looks regressed but still hits shots), Shake, Tobias looks better, and even the 2 rookies Maxey and (especially) Isaiah Joe can hit from 3. This team can go far even without a second shot-creator type player since they have so many shooters. If they try to double Joel, there will be someone open who will make you pay. If they don’t double, then who’s gonna stop Joel 1 on 1?"
The Tyrese Maxey and Isaiah Joe show will be lit in a couple years.
"Haha my bad, just responded based off the title... Fultz was still a Sixer at one point. But yea in that case Maxey has been a stud. Definitely think he will continue to develop well. I really like his game. Isaiah Joe would be my next up. Shooting 38.6% from 3"
&gt;Ranks in the 100th percentile as a scorer out of pick and roll (1.56 pos) where he's shooting 69.4%   The list of top points per possession as the P&amp;R ballhandler is pretty funny:   1. Morris 2. Temple 3. Isaiah Joe 4. Neto 5. Randle 6. Burks 7. Bone
"**Sixers rookies:**    Maxey: literally the goat. Doesn’t fear anyone on the court. Maxey would drive to rim against Rudy Gobert or Anthony Davis, it’s insane to his confidence. Floater is literally wet as fuck, it’s his best tool and he rapidly looks to be up there with guys like trae and harden in terms of players with best floaters. Good midrange too and the three is better than advertised. Needs to work on getting other guys involved tho, as if there’s times when his shot isn’t falling, a good point guard needs to be able to play-make so they stay on the floor.   Isaiah Joe: looked rough his first couple games, although he was getting spotty minutes and seemed to be really testing the waters in terms of what shots were working best for him. Recently though, he’s been pretty lethal as a catch and shoot guy, like two or three games ago he dropped like 18 and then followed up the next night with like 16. Guy was shooting from pretty deep too. Defensively he’s been alright. Looks like he is already a good team defender, he’s had some smart plays whether it be a steal or a good switch. His struggles are also mainly on the defensive end with defending bigger wings and forwards, so I’m hoping he’s working closely with the strength and conditioning coaches to bulk up. Also doesn’t have enough confidence in his handle, as he can get into the habit of deferring when even a little pressure is applied by the defender. I’m not really worried in this regard, he’s a rookie fighting for minutes trying to only make the right plays and not mess up to much. Although it is harder to tell of what his full capabilities are at this point.    Paul Reed: he’s still gettin out the mud   Nah he hasn’t played much and he’s really more of a old school four aka a small ball five in today’s game and we have plenty of centers so he hasn’t been able to see many minutes."
"Tyrese Maxey is a fun, quick guard who has some crafty moves to get to the basket. Doesn't draw many fouls as a result, though. His three point shot is inconsistent but at least he takes them. He's small but tries hard on defense and has been navigating screens well. He also works hard and genuinely seems to want to be in Philly. I'm just worried for him that he'll be compared to Harden for the rest of his career because the trade never went through.   Isaiah Joe's shot definitely translated from college, he just needs to put on more weight. Despite this, he's another guy who tries hard on D. Korkmaz should take back his spot in the rotation but since he's an expiring contract, I don't think we've seen the last of Joe.   B-ball Paul Reed still has to get it out of the mud. Other than in games where the Sixers are forced to have a 7 man rotation, he's usually only in for garbage time. He fights hard for rebounds and has a nice skyhook but is obviously still kinda raw. Hopefully he can get some more seasoning when the Blue Coats start back up."
I’ve watched a lot of 76ers games this year because I’m a huge fan of Isaiah Joe (Woo pig and stuff) and will say even when you guys played with like 7 people it was fun basketball.   Some of these young guys (especially Maxey imo) could develop into really special players.
Moses Moody looks to be getting the respect he deserves as a prospect. Both Mason Jones and Isaiah Joe are already showing promise as second round picks
Isaiah Joe is a lethal shooter. His stroke looks great
I literally don’t care. Look at how Embiid is playing look at how Tobias is playing look at how Shake is playing look at how Maxey is playing heck look how ISAIAH JOE is playing the Sixers would’ve damaged their promising future with this trade. As a Sixers fan I am fine
Maxey-Shake-Thybulle/Furkan-Mike Scott-Dwight  By far the best bench we've had since we drafted Embiid. Also Isaiah Joe looks like he might be a nice bench shooter
"Isaiah Joe on KD, Terrence Ferguson on Harden, Dakota Mathias on Kyrie"
The slander not mentioning my boi Isaiah Joe
"I'm so glad isaiah Joe is getting play, he was touted as a quick trigger guy and he's getting his legs under after a slow start"
ASK ABOUT ISAIAH JOE
"Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Paul Reed, mike Scott, Dakota Mathias, Tobias Harris...its like all our players"
"Isaiah Joe has two first names, you gotta watch out for those guys"
Isaiah Joe is doing a great job filling in while he has the chance.
Did Kyrie play with fucking Isaiah Thomas and Joe Dumars and Bill Lambier?  Your argument is fucking stupid therefore your comparison is worthless
"Isaiah Joe, Dakota Mathias, and Paul Reed is the big 3 of the future"
"Dakota Mathias, Isaiah Joe, Paul Reed are already a super team how much help do they need ? KD move 2.0 all over again smh"
Sources: James Harden wants to team up with Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe in Philadelphia
"Isaiah Joe looks like me defending that one guy who always calls BS fouls on himself in pickup  just standing there with his hand straight up, no contact, everything kosher, and the look of unsurprised disappointment when the fouls gets called anyways 😂"
"Bruh Embiid and Simmons playing in a back to back (and 3 in 4 days) after both being injured, and our two ball handlers fouled out leaving Embiid to run point guard in OT.  Not saying Sixers didn't have more talent but clearly Ben wasn't 100% and Sixers trotted out Isaiah Joe for 37 mins, Danny Green played 50 mins, Mike Scott wasn't on the team last week and played 46 mins, hell we had Dakota Mathias out there."
"I don't know if Houston goes for that. I low-key think the sixers are using the covid protocol to sample maxey, Isaiah Joe etc for Houston"
Wdym 76ers had certified bucket Isaiah Joe on the floor last night
Bro Isaiah joe played 37 minutes lmao
Nah didn't you know Isaiah Joe and Dakota Mathias are quality NBA players?
Tbf gabe Vincent versus Isaiah Joe is a fucking delight
"C'Mon man, I expected to win based on who was available but don't pretend like the Sixers weren't pretty decimated too. Missing two starters, our sixth man, and a couple of other rotation pieces. Our closing lineup included Isaiah Joe and Dakota Mathias."
We played Isaiah Joe 37 minutes bud.
Bro he was out there running point guard for the last 12 minutes of the game.   Dakota Mathias should count as a -3 when it comes to adding up 8 players.   Mike Scott. Isaiah Joe. Danny Green. That was our finishing lineup.
I for one was stoked to see the marquee matchup of Chris Silva vs Isaiah Joe or whatever is stupidly happening.
"Heat charge, foul on Isaiah Joe. Ben gets blocked, foul on him.   Dwight can't even get a board without someone flopping"
Isaiah Joe is a real player? Saw that name in 2kgm and thought it was a placeholder name to fill out the draft candidates lmao
"That's what we thought would happen against the Hawks, but the game was just such a shitshow - their entire defense collapsed on him and wore him out while (correctly) betting that Isaiah Joe and Danny Green playing point guard wouldn't make them pay. Embiid ended up with like 25 pts and we pulled him because we were down like 25 halfway through the third quarter"
We played Dakota Mathias (2 way player) and Isaiah joe (2nd round rookie) 40+ mins. Tony Bradley (3rd string) 25+ mins and Paul reed (2nd round rookie) 25+ mins.   What’s your point?
"Lmao you're really stuck on this hill thinking your team is more depleted than the Sixers aren't you?  Ben Simmons, all-NBA player and a starter, was out.  Tobias Harris, a starter, was out.  Seth Curry, a starter and the league leader in 3P%, was out.   Shake Milton, our sixth man, was out. So far, this is 4 of our top 6 guys.   Korkmaz was out.  Matisse Thybulle was out.   As far as I can see, your full starting 5 played meaningful minutes and we played every player available, including Mathias, Reed, Isaiah Joe, and Tony Bradley, all of whom will spend most of the season in the G League."
Isaiah Joe is the best name of all time
"Isaiah Joe, Paul Reed, and Dakota Mathias are definitely the stars of someone's MyGM team in 2040."
Having the Sixers start Dakota Mathias and Isaiah Joe against a full strength Nuggets team with a 3:00 tip off scheduled at the same time as the first round of the NFL playoffs was HUGE for the ratings.  Cancelling would be unthinkable.  The league could never financially recover.
Isaiah Joe sounds like a fake 2K college player
Isaiah Joe and Paul Reed development minutes
"Some of them do it, but Isaiah Joe ain't that.    Not trying to dump on the guy but he's a G-leaguer right now."
"Isaiah Joe struggling to adjust to the NBA.  Still think he can be good, but he definitely has some work to put in."
I’m not sure if your whole team being out is a valid excuse against Dakota Mathias Isaiah Joe and Paul Reed
i just got destroyed by Isaiah Joe and Tony Bradley in dynasty league that basically has all players who are in NBA on our teams so someone even has them
The disrespect to Isaiah Joe.
Why does Isaiah Joe inexplicably sound like a nickname.
Isaiah Joe sounds like amish version of G.I. Joe.
The name Isaiah Joe makes him sound like a black hillbilly
Isaiah Joe
Isaiah Joe Mama
"who are ""Paul Reed"" and ""Isaiah Joe"" and ""Dakota Mathias"""
Is this supposed to be surprising? Nuggets are facing Isaiah Joe. It should be expected
This is an Isaiah joe fan page
I have wanted to see some Isaiah Joe since I saw his draft highlights. It's like the league wants us to have a Process-esque game
TIL Isaiah Joe and Dakota Mathias exist
"Danny Green, Paul Reed, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tony Bradley, Isaiah Joe and Dakota Mathias. Mike Scott, who has a left knee contusion, was upgraded and will dress but is not likely to see playing time, Sixers coach Doc Rivers said.  Sizers beat writer on The Athletic"
"Isaiah Joe, Dakota Mathias, Tony Bradley, Paul Reed are so far at the end of the bench, they usually outside the arena during game time.  Maxey has been given an opportunity to shine."
"Isaiah Joe and Dakota Mathias are shooters. They're just G-League level, gonna see a lot of bricks from them. It's going to look like last season's roster but less talented."
"yeah by my count it leaves 7 players available: Simmons, Maxey, Dwight, Isaiah Joe, Terrance Ferguson, Tony Bradley, Dakota Mathias  (Mike Scott and Furkan Korkmaz are injured)"
TIL Isaiah Joe is a person in the nba
fml there goes our bench we about to be starting matisse and 6th man isaiah joe

"You don't follow the sixers til the season starts? I was actually excited to see them all play. Isaiah Joe, Mathias, Paul Reed."
glad we get to see some more isaiah Joe
Isaiah Joe minutes!
"in fear of becoming an inanimate body part of a man, i have decided to allow the going all the way of the philadelphia 76ers. however, this burden will be lifted off of my shoulders and placed onto that of the 49th overall pick isaiah joe. the fate of the 76ers are now bound by the greatness, or therelackof, of mr. joe. godspeed."
"I'm just thinking both lack lateral quickness on D and they are both limited offensively, though Nesmith is supposed to be an elite shooter. My ideal draft was Jalen Smith or Bey, Isaiah Joe or Bane, then the best big on the board &amp; Yam Madar to close it out."
"they're probably enough US Americans either playing internationally, D league, or even the Big3 to make up a decent roster. idk about a gold winning roster but a decent roster to say the least. Isaiah Thomas, cuttino Mobley, Joe Johnson, big baby, amar'e Stoudemire, nate Robinson, royce white...big3 all stars and IT. why not?"
"I think it was always a deep draft. A lot of guys have came in and helped their teams, even some late picks second rounders.   Pritchard has been great for the Celtics. Theo Maledon has looked very good. Xavier Tillman and Desmond Bane are effective rotation players and spot starters for a .500 team. Immanuel Quickley looks like he's gonna be a very good player. Isaiah Joe from Philly is still very raw but when they needed a shooter to insert into the lineup he played generally well.   And then I think there's quite a couple more second rounders who will become solid rotation players. Saben Lee has had some good flashes for Detroit, Paul Reed is tearing up the  G League for Philly.   All of those guys picked 20+, and then add on Wiseman, Patrick Williams, Lamelo, Halibuton with all-star potential and then Bey, Achiuwa, Maxey from non-lottery picks showing future starter ability. It's a good draft, and there's always going to be late bloomers as well"
Can you imagine Furk getting into the 3 point shooting competition against Steph Curry? Or Isaiah Joe bombing from way outside? Virtual H.O.R.S.E.? Your idea is brilliant - so many options.
Isaiah Joe?
"Isaiah Joe, lead us to the promised land"
"I still think the pick made sense from a value perspective (the Miami pick was viewed as a very valuable asset at the time) and Zhaire Smith was seen as an extremely high upside defender with good shot instincts. SGA was viewed as an equally raw player at the time, and Bridges was seen as a low ceiling/middle floor type player who was on the older side (obviously he’s taken some spectacular leaps)  I’d say the last few years we’ve actually been pretty effective in drafting to fill out the roster.   The last 3 drafts have gotten us:  - Shake Milton who is our primary bench scorer  - Landry Shamet who played a lot before being a key piece in the Harris trade  - Matisse Thybulle who is our primary bench defender who very well could slot into the starters role next year  - Tyrese Maxey who is our high upside combo guard who should help lead the bench and eventually push for a starting role  - Isaiah Joe who will be the bench shooter replacing Korkmaz next year and has defended a bit better than expected in limited run  - Paul Reed who is absolutely obliterating the GLeague and should be our bench big next season.    I’d say we’ve actually done a pretty good job hitting on contributors with upside relative to their draft position."
"Maxey is waayyy more valuable than Nunn. Nunn will be 26 next season, he's likely in his final form as a bench spark plug. Maxey may have shown less, but he's over five years younger, that makes him more valuable. I think Precious/Maxey are basically on the same level, but Philly also have Thybulle, Isaiah Joe, Korkmaz, and Shake Milton (who, notably, has been putting up numbers similar to Nunn while being two years younger.) Then there's picks: Miami has given up most of their picks in trades, Philly has most of theirs and a number of potentially valuable seconds (Knicks this year, most favorable of us/Hawks/Nets in 2023, Heat 2024.) Finally, as far as filler, Heat are giving up Iggy/Olynyk, whereas the 76ers are giving up Danny Green, Mike Scott, and one of Terrance Ferguson/Tony Bradley. Those last two are a wash, solely useful for being expiring, but IMO Danny Green is a better player than either Iggy or Olynyk, and can help the Raps retool while remaining competitive."
"2018 Cavs  &gt; Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give LeBron James and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kyle Korver gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard J.R. Smith yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”  &gt; “At the end of the day, I like being around guys that want to win and work hard,” James said. “I know I demand a lot of excellence in my teammates. I demand it out of myself, too. On the road, we are going to play as well as we can and put ourselves in contention to compete for another championship. And that’s my mindset.”  After making these 3 trades on Feb 8, 2018:  * Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  * Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  * As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings. (UTA receives right to exchange 2024 second-round pick with CLE.) (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)"
"Coming out of an all-time bad conference and teaming up with 2 other all stars when 80% of the top players in the league were in the West  Very impressive going through the corpses of KG/Pierce/Ray, 20yo Rose, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry, Marcus Morris, 5'6 Isaiah Thomas, 5'7 Kemba Walker, teenage Jayson Tatum etc. Most these guys can't even make AS teams in the West (Isaiah, Demar, Lowry, Millsap, Horford, even PG was an injury replacement his first year etc). And these guys were his main competition in the shitty ass Least hahahaha. And he had Wade/Bosh or Kyrie/Love on his team  The best player Lebron saw in the East for his finals streak was Paul George LMFAO. And we see what Playoff P truly is in a real conference the past 3 seasons. Upset as the favorite 3 straight years, getting sonned by Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum and Gary Harris."
why did Isaiah Joe think he couldnt grab the ball?
"Isaiah Thomas, Ben Wallace, Joe Dumars, Grant Hill, Dennis Rodman"
"Isaiah Joe should totally be. Anyone who says he shouldn’t is a communist.  Also, Randle should be in along with Simmons."
"What the hell happened to our bench? Furkan, Maxey, and Dwight suddenly became almost unplayable. Thybulle gives nothing on offense most games. Isaiah Joe should not have to be getting crucial bench minutes. Shake was working his way back from injury and still did twice as much as any bench player."
Isaiah Joe has gotta be a 2k generated player. No way he's real.
"From what I remember Isaiah Thomas, Joe Johnson, James Nunnally and Brandon Bass are the ex nba guys on the US team rn."
"Maxey is good. And as for Isaiah Joe, there's basically non-stop #freeIsaiahJoe posts anytime Danny Green or Furkan Korkmaz are tossing up bricks"
yeah we’ve had this convo before i think lol. im still just not impressed enough with thybulle on offense. just don’t think he ever gets to a passable level   korkmaz won’t play in the playoffs anyway so i’d rather just give the minutes to isaiah joe if they aren’t gonna send him to the bubble
Joe Johnson and Isaiah Thomas about to tear it up. Wishing the best for these guys who are working hard to make it back into the league
Tyrese Maxey: 4 time league MVP  Isaiah Joe: 4 time All-Star.
"If it’s Danny, a pick and something like Isaiah Joe, id agree, but I feel keeping maxey should be a priority to be able to continue to compete."
We need to give Isaiah Joe more minutes. Dude is not hesitant to shoot and has quite a quick trigger
"Since Curry got COVID, the Sixers have gotten very little meaningful production outside Harris Ben and Embiid. Hopefully Shake can turn things around when he comes back from injury and Isaiah Joe gets minutes over Kork (not saying Joe can contribute, but I’m just tried of seeing Kork dribble into turnovers and fail to get open for threes)."
"Kinda sad that the sixers have so many exciting young prospects that need playtime, but aren't quite good enough to be significant role players on a contender. Maxey, Isaiah Joe, hell even furk and matisse are questionable.  That being said, maybe some trades could open up more time for shake at the 2."
"Isaiah Joe? Cool, I’m down for that."
"It's been said Tilman was so pissed off at Morey that he wanted like every player and asset we have lol. It would be like Embiid, Harden, Seth Curry Paul Reed, and Isaiah Joe out there lmao"
"I feel the same way. I reeeeally like Maxey and am high on his long-term potential, which is why I’m tied up about it. I think Lowry is likely the better player for the next 2-3 years, and with Embiid’s current level of play, I lean toward prioritizing that, but I hate trading away a legit guard creator who should fit well with Ben and Jo in time. It’s tough. I’d definitely push to do the deal with Tisse with some other sweeteners (a high second, Korkmaz, Isaiah Joe as options), but that gets complicated and I don’t know if it gets done. Could depend on Toronto’s record and Lowry’s motivation for a trade."
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
Isaiah Thomas-Joe Dumars-Mark Aguirre-Dennis Rodman-Bill Laimbeer
"All good! I’ve been debating that exact point in my head for a week or so, I actually don’t think this rumor has much substance but it’s been great to hear more Raptors fans opinions on what the cost might look like.  The same reasons I’d prefer to give up Matisse are of course the same reasons the Raptors would push for Maxey instead. I think that’s kinda the lynchpin on if the deal would or wouldn’t happen, outside of other factors like other teams bids, and how much Toronto is motivated to trade him.  One thing I wonder, is if Maxey is included, is he enough sort of on his own? IE just him and the salary pieces? I sort of feel like he would be, but I’m also really, really high on him. Matisse is notably less valuable, but how much does an additional 1st + other sweeteners (high 2nds, Furkan, Isaiah Joe, etc) make up the difference. I don’t know the answers obviously. I do think the Sixers have some serious advantages since most other contenders don’t have any picks, so the bidding can’t be driven up, and Lowry has obvious ties to Philly.  Masai’s obviously a great GM so he’s not gonna trade Lowry if he doesn’t get something seriously worthwhile."
"Doesn’t the fact that you’re using one guys lack of minutes played as an excuse for why he has shown literally nothing in his career and defending a 6 foot rookie who will get run off the gym in the playoffs kind of make my point for me? Like comparing that to the sixers main guards off the bench of shake Milton, Thybulle and George hill whenever he gets here is a stark contrast. Like tyrese maxey and Isaiah joe aren’t even in the rotation and they’ve both shown more than Langford as rookies"

Ben Simmons gotta forfeit his game check to Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe
[Not this one](https://www.google.com/amp/s/hoopshype.com/lists/team-usa-isaiah-thomas-joe-johnson/amp/)
Isaiah Joe? Yeah me too.
"Nah I'm good dont worry. I live in a poor city. You can probably figure out which one by looking at my profile. I rent a 2 bedroom house for under 500/month. Thats what I meant by life changing. I dont make a ton of money, but for my city I do ok and its very very low COL. Ive always made really good money on 1st score, going back... 8ish years now. $800 on Dawson Knox in the afccg on $40, $600 on gronk in the sb, hit on Isaiah Mckenzie on the Bills twice when his odds were above +4000 last season. And those are only a few, I could name about a dozen more just from last NFL season alone. Im... phenomenal at figuring out game plans and that may sound snotty but oh well, it true. 1st score, the odds are so high i only ever have to spend $20-40. Ive only been at it for NBA like 3 weeks, If you check my post history, even before that hit, I posted a miss i had, got 2/3 specifically saying I'm getting closer and closer every night...thats only one night where I got 2/3. I got 2/3 Four nights in a row until FINALLY hitting (getting impatient on +55000 odds. That it took a whole 3 weeks). I got 2/3 again last night, kristaps and Jerami Grant were my 2 guys. I should've just thrown 10 on just those 2, but I tossed them on tickets with Brook Lopez, Morris on LA, Joe Harris etc. Got greedy.  4k is practically life changing in now I have some breathing room. I can make these bets for the next 30 days in a row, not hit a single thing and not worry (spend $20-40 a night). That ain't gonna happen. But its just 4k is by far the largest amount I've ever won and now I can try and take another step up with these bets. Instead of winning 2200 on $4, im gonna be able to put $6 on it, make it a 4k win. Once I hit another one, I'll be able to do $10. And so on. Slowly but smartly. I appreciate the concern but im good. If I can keep doing what I've been doing I can actually start looking at buying a house"
I don’t want him I’d rather get Isaiah Joe or Paul Reed but I doubt you’d give either up. Matisse is overrated.
"""The supremely talented"" = a guy that's out of the league, that shot 48% at the rim as a center, is a below average 3pts shooter, can't move, can't protect the rim and is a headcase.   I guess Isaiah Thomas, Joe Johnson, Tyson Chandler should also all be in the league, cause he's even more washed then those guys"
"Philly, they have Ben and Joel under contract for the next few years also unlike many other contenders Philly still has various first round picks over the next few years. Also they still have young and upcoming players such as Matisse, Shake Milton, Maxey, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe. They have a great combination of win now players and assets to help the team get better over the next couple of years."
"No idea, and Joe Harris couldnt do it.  Wilt’s career best season per100 sits at approximately 38 points.  After 5 minutes of research:  Kobe has surpassed it 4 times  Jordan has done it 11 times.  Harden has done it 4 times.  Iverson has done it 2 times.  T-Mac has done it 1 time.  KD has done it 4 times.  Gervin did it 2 times.  Shaq did it 6 times.  Isaiah Thomas did it 1 time.  Beal did it 2 times.  Westbrook did it 2 times.  So that’s 39 examples that I kinda randomly picked as examples. I might be wrong about 100 examples, but it can definitely go over 50."
"Totally valid from Toronto's perspective, but from the Philly side that's 3 rotation players plus Maxey. A 3 for 1 would be tough on Philly's depth, even if two of those three are quite replaceable. Philly's only remaining wings would be...Simmons, Korkmaz, Curry, Isaiah Joe, and Terrance Ferguson. One reliable player, two one-way shooters who will get targeted in the playoffs, a rookie 2nd rounder and a guy who'll be out of the league in six months.   If you turned it into a 3-team trade with, say, OKC, and Philly sends out a pick and also gets George Hill and, like, Kenrich Williams, then it's worth it for the Sixers."
"When I was a kid, the Pistons were the very best team.   They had Mahorn, Lambeer, John Salley... 18 hard fouls to dole out every night. They had Joe Dumars and Isaiah Thomas -- an incredible backcourt. They had Dennis Rodman who was unlike any player I'd ever seen before.   The league was in this interregnum between hyping the hell out of the Lakers/Celtics and hyping the hell out of Michael Jordan and the Pistons small-market mean-spirited non-beautiful basketball dominated the league.   They were a team that dispensed with any veneer of cosmetic likeability and instead literally maimed other teams en route to two titles.    As a guy who loved basketball and had almost no talent, they had so many players to emulate and identify with. Watching them beat (in every sense of the word) Michael Jordan was incredible.    Also, Bill Laimbeer pointing out that [he was the only player in the NBA who made less money than his dad](https://vault.si.com/vault/1986/04/07/a-crashing-success)is still legend."
"I mean seriously we started a game with Isaiah Joe, Tyrese Maxey, Dakota Mathias, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard with a bench of Paul Reed, Tony Bradley, and supposedly Mike Scott I’m not sure why anyone is shocked that our differential is a bit off."
"No stars are available right now. I’d imagine the Embiid Simmons pairing will be allowed to prove themselves this season, and if they fall short again, there will be heavy rumours but they’ll get one last shot before trading one of the two. Other than that they have pretty limited assets to trade. Maxey is an option, but he’s average just under 8 PPG and 2 APG, he’s going to be a good player, but not remotely enough to bring in a real scoring threat. Trading Harris is an option, but he’s in the second year of his 5 year $180 million contract. He’s still tradeable, but he’s a 20 PPG shot creator, he’s probably their best option now. I can’t see them trading for a better option. He’s not on a great contract, but he’s done well this year, and there’s no upgrade that they can get at the moment.  They have some other assets, but if they want to compete, they should hold onto them. Thybulle is a good asset, but wouldn’t you want to hold onto an elite wing defender who’s an alright enough 3 point shooter? They’ve got lesser assets like Ferguson, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, but they haven’t proven to be more than subpar rotation pieces, and they’re just not going to net you great players. If a superstar becomes available and they can make an offer of Harris, Maxey, Ferguson and picks, then by all means do it. But at the moment, I can’t see any trade options for them."
"i would hate to be isaiah joe, Blue Coats PGs don’t pass at all"
"I think George Hill to Philly would be cool if they don't pull off the Buddy deal that's been in some unsubstantiated rumours    Hill won't fetch you a Maxey or Mitlon or anything because of age, but maybe Isaiah Joe/Paul Reed or something as the young player. I haven't looked at the salaries to see how it would work"
"I knew about the Pistons, Isaiah Thomas, Joe Dumars, Bill Lambeer, they were just before my time, but plenty of highlights, of course, but Dennis Rodman wasn't a big star, and sports weren't a big thing until Jordan and ESPN. So I still forget that all the time, even though I can still picture that whole team in my mind's eye quite easily.  Dennis and the Pistons just weren't a huge deal at the time. They weren't memes like Jordan, Pippen and Rodman, to put it in post-modern terms."
Fuck are you on about? Everyone on the Heat says he leads the locker room. More impact than Isaiah Joe or whoever the 12 man is on your team
"Everyone but Mike Scott, Isaiah Joe, Anthony Tolliver, and Paul Reed. The only one I do not want to see on the floor under any circumstance is Scott.   Ceterum autem censeo Mike Scott esse delendam"
"Just Tyrese Maxey, Anthony Tolliver, and Isaiah Joe playing in the second quarter of our potential 1 seed clincher. As we all expected to start the season"
"Isaiah Thomas might be a jerk, but you are insane if you don’t think he wasn’t a superstar, they also had Marc Aguirre. Joe Dumars is close and say what you want, Rodman was a dominant player for a decade. Those are not “second fiddle“ players."
Isaiah Thomas and Joe Dumars would like a word with you..
Isaiah Thomas Joe Dumars Tayshaun Prince Rasheed Wallace Ben Wallace 6man - Dave Bing cuz it's impossible to leave him off the list. Also never realized that all the pistons greats are shooting guards
"How has Isaiah Joe been?  I watched him play with the Razorbacks and he was a huge part of our team, went like 0-5 without him when he was injured. Haven’t really had time to watch much of him since he got drafted."
Congrats on the win philly. This makes up for the game where y’all had to play Isaiah Joe and Dakota Mathias against us
"like a few have mentioned in here, man it would have been loads of fun if Paul was drafted during the process years. Love seeing this guy on the court, and yeah he makes some pretty bad mistakes, but he is so enjoyable to watch. Hope the Sixers sign him to a deal like Shake's this off-season. Should sign Isaiah Joe too, great getting those guy at those low numbers, and seems to push that the Sixers can trade some draft picks because they have a strong youth movement now"
Time to empty the bench. I’m here to watch Isaiah Joe get minutes.
Time to empty the bench. Isaiah Joe please.
Isaiah joe

Isaiah Thomas  Joe Dumars  Rip Hamilton  Ben Wallace  Bill Laimbeer  No ones stopping this lineup
"De'Aaron Fox for Ben Simmons, Isaiah Joe/Paul Reed and a first round pick in the 2022 draft. Do the kings accept?"
"De'Aaron Fox for Ben Simmons, Isaiah Joe/Paul Reed and a first round pick in the 2021 draft who says no?"
Doc will adjust for next game by benching Korkmaz and starting Isaiah Joe at center.
Isaiah Joe with over 36 points per 36 minutes in his first playoffs. How can anyone say he's not the next MJ?
"Sixers would protect embiid, simmons, harris, curry, thybulle, hill, maxey, and milton. so out of anyoke else that isnt a free agent, itd have to be isaiah joe or paul reed. if i had to guess, a team would want joe simply for the shooting"
"Isaiah Joe, Paul Reed, and Mike Scott all sound like auto-generated 2k players"
Isaiah Joe does not flop you take that back!
"They should just trade him to the Sixers so he can finish his career playing alongside his brother.   George Hill, Isaiah Joe, Shake Milton, Paul Reed and a 1st. Make it so, Daryl."
He’s 3rd behind Isaiah Joe and Furkan Korkmaz.
"These are kind of odd examples because only the Spurs and Pistons won titles, and they've all had mixed success keeping their superstars.   The Wolves traded their one superstar to allow Boston to form a superteam (this was before LeBron -&gt; Miami). My beloved Suns couldn't keep Barkley (who left to title chase in Houston), nor could they win a title around Amare (who left for NYK) or Nash (who they had signed from Dallas), and lost out on signing multiple free agent superstars over the last 30 years (e.g. Joe Johnson left).  The Pistons had no superstar (or are you going all the way back to Isaiah?). The Spurs had Duncan, who literally almost signed with Orlando, The Admiral (legend), and then Kawhi (who left, but after LeBron-&gt; Miami)."
"I can't say this enough, for like 4 minutes the Sixers closed an NBA playoff game with  Furkhan Korkmaz, Shake Milton, Mike Scott, Paul Reed, and Isaiah Joe.   In a win. 🤮 The disrespect."
It's Isaiah Joe and Paul Reed time. In the playoffs.
We gonna get that Isaiah Joe/Anthony Tolliver disrespect energy tonight yo
"How about the 2018 Cavs?  &gt; Traded Dwyane Wade to the Miami Heat for a 2024 2nd round draft pick. (Pick is heavily protected and not expected to convey.)  &gt; Traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and a 2018 1st round draft pick (Moritz Wagner was later selected) to the Los Angeles Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr..  &gt; As part of a 3-team trade, the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose and a 2024 2nd round draft pick to the Utah Jazz; the Cleveland Cavaliers traded Dimitrios Agravanis, Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Sacramento Kings; the Sacramento Kings traded Artūras Gudaitis and George Hill to the Cleveland Cavaliers; the Utah Jazz traded Rodney Hood to the Cleveland Cavaliers; and the Utah Jazz traded Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash to the Sacramento Kings.

"Paul reed, Isaiah Joe, and Tyrese Maxey all in one draft."
And there he is!!!!   Isaiah Joe lmao.
Alright. We have Mike Scott. We have Paul Reed.   Give me Isaiah Joe for ultimate disrespect.
Give me Isaiah Joe for pure disrespect.
If Isaiah Joe makes an appearance before halftime you know Doc got no respect.
How does one Ben Simmons and Isaiah Joe sound for LaVine? I think he'd make us great.
No chance we'd put Isaiah Joe up. Mike Scott will be the hero Seattle never asked for.
"Embiid, Simmons, Tobi, Curry, Mattisse, Maxey, Shake. That 8th spot is kinda tough. I’m gonna go with Isaiah Joe."
"Embiid, Ben, Thybulle, Seth, Shake, Maxey, DG and Isaiah Joe"
"Lowest contested rebound percentage, minimum 50% of games played  Patty Mills (6.0%) Tyus Jones (7.3%) Isaiah Joe (9.1%) JJ Redick &amp; Trey Burke (9.4%) **Carmelo Anthony is at 27.8%**  Melo is the GOAT."
Clearly Isaiah “Strokin’” Joe should be Rookie of the Year.
"GG fellas, hopefully we can let Maxey, BBall Paul and Isaiah Joe run 30+ minutes Sunday. Rest the starters  Also shout out Joe finding his shooting stroke a little"
#1 BABY!  Off 11 points from Isaiah Joe.  Give the king his damn crown!
Isaiah Joe with 11!
Bball Paul and Isaiah Joe are on the court!
"&gt;That’s not what I said, but I guess reading comprehension is difficult.  You're gonna put this on me that I can't make sense of your nonsensical idea? OK 🙄  How exactly are the Sixers getting far enough under the salary cap to have the roughly $20 million it would take to sign Lowry? Here's what's on their books for next season if they renounce everyone they can:  * Tobias Harris - $36 million  * Ben Simmons - $33 million  * Joel Embiid - $31.58 million  * Seth Curry - $8.2 million  * Matisse Thybulle - $2.84 million  * Tyrese Maxey - $2.6 million  * Shake Milton - $1.85 million  * Isaiah Joe - $1.52 million  * George Hill - $1.3 million  * Roster holds for 3 empty spots - $2.78 million  * 28th pick - 2.02 million  * **Total - $123.69**  The salary cap for next season is estimated to be $112 million. That means the Sixers would need to shed about $31 million in salary to open up $20 million to make Lowry an offer (assuming you can get him for that much). So what is it you're saying, just salary dump Simmons and Curry to the Spurs with no salary at all coming back? Doing so would open about $30 million in cap space. So then how do they get both Lowry and DeRozan?   It's not about reading comprehension, it's just that whatever this idea of yours is, it doesn't make any sense. Please be far more explicit in your explanation if this is making sense to you."
And we almost won with Isaiah JOE.
Joel Embiid and Isaiah Joe
I was born in Arkansas so imma do them out of curiosity.  Conley/Isaiah Joe/Moody/Portis/Gafford.  Gives me tanking suns lineup vibes but hey just nice to be able to make a starting 5!
"Unlike the rest of the kids here I actually had the pleasure of watching Stockton play and yes while I do believe he’s underrated I don’t think he’s better than the 3 players I listed before him. Isaiah had the deeper team but who on his team is even close to being a top 5 player at their position. The Pistons were a very talented deep team but in no way shape or form are they a 3 time NBA finalist, 2 time NBA champion team without him. If he’s not there the Pistons best player is probably Joe Dumars or Adrian Dantley(maybe). We are in agreement that Nash is several tiers below the other names being mentioned.   I just cant put Stockton solely over Chris because Chris never had a teammate as good as Malone. While Blake Griffin was good he’s nowhere near as good as Karl Malone was."
"Yep. The most fun I have watching the Sixers is when Isaiah Joe, Paul Reed, and Rayjon Tucker are on the floor. No stress, no expectations, no scrutiny, just fun."
might as well throw in George Hill Isaiah Joe and Paul Reed
Isaiah Joe got that sweet stroke
"Not sure about Cade, who hasn't played an NBA game yet, or Hayes, who was injured for most of his rookie year.   However, Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart have already established their roles and skillsets.   Bey was one of the best sharpshooters in that class, shooting 38% on 6 attempts per game. In fact, he made more 3s his rookie year than anyone else in his class period. With improvements on the defensive end, he will be a 3 and D wing ala Klay Thompson or Joe Harris. Even without D, Kyle Korver managed to have a fruitful 17 season career and was even an All Star.   Stewart was the best center in the class, full stop. He was easily the best rim protector in the entire class and he had a clean scoring touch around the rim and even the ability to pop the 3 every now and again. There is a reason Pistons fans are trying to get him to meet with Ben Wallace because he's Ben Wallace but with the ability to score."
"I think there's about 10 or so teams that would be interested, I may be considering Simmons' value a little high here but he's still a top 5 defender, phenomenal playmaker so it is what it is/ I could see the Sixers being interested in the following:  Simmons for Hayward  Simmons, Shake and Isaiah Joe for Kevin Love and Darius Garland  Simmons, George Hill for Westbrook  Simmons for Porzingis  Simmons, George Hill for John Wall   Simmons for Dlo  Simmons for Ingram  Simmons for Kemba (but you know OKC will want a pick lol)  Simmons for CJ  Simmons for either Buddy Hield or Fox (unsure who they'd want more, so unsure how to make cap work  Simmons for (somebody on the Spurs - Derozen maybe? If ANYONE can figure out how to ""fix"" Simmons, it's Pop)"
"Literally anything other tham the same thing over and over.   Literally put in Mike Scott and see if that works.  Put in Paul Reed. Put im Isaiah Joe at center.  I could give a fuck, just try somethimg othet then multiple stints of Simmons-Howard-Harris in the same game."
"Doc trying to fill Danny Green’s void:  Furk: alright thats not working  Tisse: eh, but could be better  Shake? Shit i guess we gotta try  Is Isaiah Joe next?"
"Exactly. We didn't even get to play Isaiah Joe last season and he could use the minutes, there's no playing time to be had outside injuries. Don't even get me started on how Paul Reed has to sit to watch andre Drummond"
Isaiah Joe. Next Steph curry
"Mo was kinda drafted high tho. I wasnt clear in my original comment, I meant when you're at picks 25 and on you should really start to pick players have the raw talent that cant be taught or is rare.  Sixders drafted Isaiah Joe late and Morey couldn't believe it because Joe shot around 10 threes a game at Arkansas on good efficiency. That confidence cant be taught and can be huge in the NBA. Mo was good all around, but he doesnt accel at one thing especially well which is why he probably should have fallen a bit. Draft a guy who has a few insane talents and fill in the gaps later."
"As a Sixers fan, definitely the Sixers, but they should be fairly fun for a neutral fan. Maxey looks fully dominant and is pushing his game a little bit from last year (particularly in his 3 pt shooting), Isaiah Joe is a super fun high volume 3 pt guy who looks like an NBA rotation player, and Bball Paul is the goofy and chaotic G League MVP of last year. Interested to see how Jaden Springer plays after last game, he was great defensively but looked jittery offensively."
"They should have Isaiah Thomas, Tyler Hansbrough, and Joe Johnson, with Jamal Crawford off the bench. That's the FIBA team next time, do that"
They should re-sign Isaiah Thomas and trade Bradley Beal for Isaiah Joe!
How is he compared to his older brother Isaiah Joe?
"Houston:  De'Aaron Fox  Stephen Jackson  Jimmy Butler  Emeka Okafor  De'Andre Jordan  We also have Justice Winslow, Kelly Oubre, Justin Jackson (Who all played for the Houston Hoops with Fox), TJ Ford, Gerald Green, Carsen Edwards, Quintin Grimes, Joe/Jacob/Michael Young, Jonthan Simmons   Dallas: *where l was born  Marcus Smart  Grant Hill  Julius Randle  Chris Bosh  LaMarcus Aldrige   Also CJ Miles, Isaiah Austin, and some young guys like Cade Cunningham, and RJ Hampton"
Milton is just as good as Thybulle and they're the same age. Reed won GLeague MVP. Isaiah Joe has legit 3&amp;D potential
"I always confuse Tony Bradley with Thomas Bryant, so at first I was excited that the Bulls got a guy like Nikola who could stretch the floor from center. Then I looked up Tony Bradley and realized he's not Thomas Bryant, but Bradley's advanced metrics are still pretty solid (20+ PER in limited minutes, for instance). So, I'm in.  Anyway, it's nice to have a solid offseason after two decades of going through things like:  * This is Phil's last year no matter what/Breaking up the best team in league history to satisfy Krause's ego. * Thinking Marcus Fizer was a small forward/an NBA player * ~~Asking Tracy McGrady if he'll shave his cornrows~~ \[Edit: Turns out I may be conflating two different stories on this one.\] * Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas * Signing late era Ben Wallace and trading early era Ben Wallace (I.E., Tyson Chandler) * Picking the wrong Italian head coach (Del Negro instead of D'Antoni) * Striking out on LeBron, Wade, Bosh to get Boozer (who was admittedly solid and goofy) * Making Luol Deng get a spinal tap * Trading Korver for nothing * Running Thibodeau out of town * Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne * Hiring Hoiberg to run a modern perimeter-based offense then signing Wade and Rondo * Giving up on Bobby Portis because he struck a Spaniard * \[Some additional edits\]: * [~~Jim Boylan~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylan) The wrong [Jim Boylen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylen). * Waiving Dinwiddie (thanks to u/darealcubs for the reminder) * Just the bewildering love affair with all things Iowa State. * Trading for John Starks * Completely forgot about the short-lived John Salmons era that ended with the Bulls trading Salmons and draft picks that turned out to be Isaiah Thomas and Larry Sanders for Joe Alexander and Hakim Warrick * Not locking up Rusty LaRue on a long term deal.  Not sure I got this all in chronological order, and obviously there were some really fun Bulls teams in there (the scrappy Ben Gordon-led teams and the Derrick Rose + Bench Mob teams of the early 10s), but I am very happy with what the Bulls have done this past couple of days. This is 100% me being a homer, but I think the only teams in the East that are clearly better are Milwaukee and Brooklyn. (""Clearly"" being the key word there.)  Anyway, I'm wearing the shit out of my Bulls hat today and now I need to stop procrastinating and get back to work."
sad but theoretically we have isaiah joe who should be able to step into furkan's role with limited drop off. furkan can't hit a shot on the road it's kind of insane.  if danny green walks i'll start to get a bit more concerned.
Really wanted him back but I guess Isaiah Joe can do a lot of the same things
So the second round still has:   * Sharife Cooper  * Jared Butler  * Miles McBride  * Ayo Dosunmu  * Jason Preston  * Joe Wieskamp  * Isaiah Todd * Isaiah Livers * Joel Ayayi * BJ Boston  There's some really good talent in there.
Joe Dumars was a HoF Robin to Isaiah Thomas
"Washington State:  PG: Dejounte Murray  SG: Avery Bradley  SF: Zach Lavine  PF: Michael Porter Jr  C: Jaden McDaniels  Reserves:  Jaden McDaniels, Kevin Porter, Malachi Flynn, CJ Elleby, Jaylen Nowell, Joe Harris, Isaiah Thomas, Corey Kispert, Robert Franks, Paolo Banchero (Need some size).   Notes:  Michael Porter Jr only played senior year in Seattle so not sure if he really counts.   Avery Bradley played his senior year in Vegas but was at a prep school so I don’t really count it."
"I mean we're going to be in the tax by 2023-2024 if we keep those players and don't get Dame. As far as the bench/rest of team goes, we still have bird rights for Korkmaz, DG, and Mike Scott, and will most likely be bringing back Hill and Reed. We'll have to see if Isaiah Joe develops into a good bench shooter or not, but he's already about G leaguer status.   Not that I am saying a bench of Hill/Joe/Korkmaz/Reed is amazing, but they're all above G League level. That team is still going to need to get lucky with good health, player development, and vets/prove yourself players willing to take a cheap deal to ring chase.   It's a pretty big gamble for sure though."
"Trade Machines tell me that it's possible if Houston gets a contract dump of a bunch of players - Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe would work, with two or three first round picks as sweetener.   So many players means that a 4th team might be needed (OKC or Memphis or San Antonio?).  Basically:   Philadelphia: John Wall and Jaden McDaniels, some 2nd rounders?  Minessota: Ben Simmons, some 2nd rounders?   Houston: Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe + 2 first round picks.  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine"
"Sixers are well poised for Ben to stay home.  They have Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton competing for minutes already, and then drafted Jaden Springer.  Milton is a legit nba player, and Maxey looks to be even better.    This is a Khawi Leonard-San Antonio holdout/injury situation.  Both sided need to call it a mental health break, like Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka did.    Considering Philly's bench also includes prospects they are high on and want to showcase for potential trades, like Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Bball Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, seems to me the Sixers can win on the court and develop at the same time Ben sits out.    If any of Chicago, Portland or Minnesota gets off to a poor start while the Sixers and Embiid chug along, philly's chances of getting Lillard, Lavine, or Edwards increases.    Edwards most likely, because KAT, Malik Beasley and Dangelo Russell and Jaden McDaniels all fit around Ben Simmons  better than Edwards if the Wolves were to trade for him.  Plus, Morey built a team lat year suited for James Harden, stands to reason the next best thing would be a prospect with Harden's skillset like Anthony Edwards.  ."
"Embiid, Maxey, Thybulle, Milton, Simmons, Harris, Drummond, Isaiah Joe, bball Paul, Springer are all under 30  Curry and Green are the only players on the roster over 30 years old for reference"
Only Rodman team that matters  * PG Isaiah Thomas * SG Joe Dumars * SF Dennis Rodman * PF Rick Mahorn * C Bill Laimbeer
"I’m not suggesting the cavs should make a trade, but if they DID trade garland or sexton for simmons, philly has plenty of extra shooting they could offer cleveland. I’d be more than happy to offer milton and Isaiah Joe in the right deal (ok that doesn’t sound too exciting but it’s better than you think)."
ok edited to replace tolliver with isaiah joe it's just a minimum contract to match salaries for the trade
"Wolves: Ben Simmons, Isaiah Joe  76ers: Kristaps Porzingis, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Tyrell Terry  Mavs: Patrick Beverly, Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey"
"Something along the lines of Okogie, McDaniels, Beasley, Prince and picks for Isaiah Joe and Simmons"
"It would be something like Beasley, McDaniels, Prince, Okogie and 3/4 picks for Simmons and Isaiah Joe"
"I know you're joking, but as someone from there it's crazy to me how many Arkansas boys get serious PT in NBA. Portis, the Monk brothers, Pat Bev, and now Moody looks like he's gonna be solid player. And I think Isaiah Joe may develop into good role player too and Austin Reaves was making some noise in summer league so who knows how he may develop. Granted that isn't a lot, but considering how small the state is, it kinda is."
PG Giannis SG Thon Maker SF Joe Ingles PF Bol Bol C Tacko Fall  6th man Isaiah Thomas  does this team break the warriors regular season record?
"Embiid, Ben, Tobias, Maxey, Thybulle   Think that these 5 are the obvious ones, if we were let 6 it would get tough between curry/green for solid vet + contract or someone young like BBall Paul, Isaiah Joe or even Kork/Shake"
"Also in the 20216-17 season:  Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside and DeAndre Jordan were starters who led the league in rebounds and were near the top in blocks.  Isaiah Thomas was the league's 3rd leading scorer.  John Wall led the league in steals and was 3rd in assists (edging out Ricky Rubio for his spot).  Kyle Korver, Allen Crabbe, Joe Ingles and Otto Porter were top 4 in 3pt accuracy.  DeMarcus Cousins set the high water mark for personal fouls.  Westbrook is the 4th oldest guy out of all the players I mentioned here."
No that’s the entire purpose of legal contracts. If the sixers wanted to void the contract for breach they could. But they won’t because they desperately need him/ what he returns in a trade. Which is why Ben has leverage. If Isaiah joe decided to not play he’d be cut
"Funny stat I noticed from game 1, between Danny Green and Isaiah Joe they played a combined 30 minutes and finished 0/0/0/0/0 with 4 PF, but somehow a +4."
"Danny was useless the whole game after his two 3’s to start the night. Normally he’s at least a plus on defense but tonight all he did was use up our team fouls, and his air balls were unbelievable.   Doc refuses to sit starters/vets if they are having an off night and it’s one of the main reasons Doc sucks. Put Korkmaz or goddamn Isaiah Joe in in Green’s place and I guarantee the 6ers don’t play that lead. Danny was a black hole on both sides of the ball"
"Sorry that the Sixers don’t want your scraps for an all star dpoy candidate. Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and a couple crappy late picks. Wow yeah! That’s definitely not wasting Embiids prime. Those two players literally add nothing to our team. We have Maxey, Isaiah Joe, Korkmaz and Seth Curry who all play a similar shooting guard role to beasley. So if we trade for him it literally just pushes one of our good young role players who are in need of development out of the roster for a player who is not that much better. Yes beasley averaged 19 last year but he adds nothing new to our team that we need and he only averaged that much cuz kat and dlo were out for most of the season. He isn’t taking 16 shots a night at the Sixers. Jaden McDaniels, sure he’s an good young prospect but his ceiling isn’t that high and we have Tobias Harris and George’s Niang who are both better than him. Niang shoots 40% + from 3. So McDaniels would be lucky to even be in the bench rotation. In conclusion, we get nothing"
"You’re acting like Jrue holiday and Khris Middleton are role players and aren’t stars. Your point basically proves moreys point. And yes we don’t need another super star but we need another star pg who can distribute and shit create. What role players do we need? We are stacked on role players. We have a very solid bench. Korkmaz, Isaiah Joe, Andre Drummond, Niang, Thybulle. Thybulle and Drummond provide good defense. Drummond provides good rebounding. They are all solid at defending. Korkmaz brings the shot creation and ball distribution, Joe and Niang are very good catch and shoot players. And then in our starting lineup we have three very solid role players, Curry, Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey. So which role players do you propose that make us into a title contender huh? 1-2 solid role players and we are just pushing out players like Joe and Maxey who are developing very nicely. The fact is we need another 20+ ppg player who can be relied upon on the perimeter in the fourth"
"Simmons is in no way the 76ers best asset.   Better assets include:  * 2027 and 2028 FRPs * Seth Curry * Korkmaz * Thybulle * Maxey * Isaiah Joe   Ben Simmons is on a max contract and is probably impossible to build around. You realistically can't get a better team for him than the 76ers are now. If the 76ers can't even get to the ECF with him, then no team is getting to a conference finals with him."
"Honestly if CJ was 2-3"" taller I'd be okay with the trade, but we really need someone who can slot into the SF spot at least part time and he's just too small for that defensively. Therefore I feel he's too redundant with Seth and Isaiah Joe right now (better than both but much more expensive as well)."
I know Sixers fans are really up on Kork and Isaiah Joe but these all bench line ups are going to be brutal for the Sixers esp with Milton out.
Only if his name is Isaiah Joe
"In fairness he used to be cheap.  Young Joe Johnson was a perfect fit alongside Nash with his defense, size, shooting and iso ability when 7SoL down but they traded JJ to Atlanta when he hit restricted free agency.  Luol Deng, then the seventh pick in the draft, got traded for a second round pick and cash.  They traded Isaiah Thomas at the deadline before he hit free agency and Goran Dragic in part to dump the Brandon Knight deal.  I don't think Sarver is being cheap right now, I don't think Ayton is worth $40 million plus luxury tax payments, but he has earned his reputation and I have little sympathy."
"The lakers pick package was the 4th pick, 2 first picks, and 1 pick swap. The sixers would offer 2 first picks and 4 pick swaps. Yes the lakers pick package is better, but unprotected picks and unprotected pick swaps that are very far down the line have a lot of value because of their potential to be high lottery picks. Think about what the nets gave up for harden- the most valuable part of that package was the picks far away in the future. So again, lakers with the better picks package, but the inclusion of unprotected picks and pick swaps 4+ years in the future helps the sixers offer a lot.  And again, I believe if you judge based on 2019 value: 2021 simmons, maxey, thybulle, isaiah joe &gt; 2019 ingram, lonzo, hart. Easily better tbh.  &gt; multiple teams would swoop in to beat that offer if lillard does become available for trade.  Is this possible? Absolutely. But when you narrow down the potential suitors, it's not clear that anyone would beat the sixers offer.  Warriors: IMO they would be favorites to trade for lillard. But they would have to give up most of their future assets, and owner Joe Lacob has gone on record multiple times that the warriors don't want to give up their future. So it's not clear that they would go all in.  Nuggets: they had a good package, but after giving Michael Porter jr the max, the poison pill clause kicks in, so he's basically impossible to trade this season. Murray + picks does not beat sixers offer.  Celtics: would have to include jaylen to beat the sixers offer. Seems unlikely that they would do that.  Knicks: would have to give up RJ, a haul of picks, and quite possibly quickley and more. I do not believe the knicks would give up their whole future for a duo of dame/randle.  If I'm forgetting anyone let me know. But I think it's quite possible the sixers would end up with the best package."
"&gt; Ingram&gt;Simmons  We're talking about 2019 ingram's trade value. I don't think his trade value back then was actually that good. Same with Lonzo, he was actually pretty bad in LA. Both players made huge strides in new orleans. And then you can throw in thybulle and isaiah joe, who combined clearly are worth a lot more than hart.   Either way, the pels got a pretty massive haul for AD. The fact that the sixers offer is in the same universe means it's at least passable, IMO."
"If the thunder would agree to unprotect the sixers 2025 pick, they can offer like 2 picks and 4 pick swaps I think. They also have other young players like thybulle and isaiah joe (people don't know about joe but he's better than shake at this point).  So the entire offer would be something like:  Simmons  2022 pick swap, 2023 first rounder, 2024 pick swap, 2026 pick swap, 2027 first rounder, 2028 pick swap  maxey, thybulle, joe, (+ any other less valuable young players: springer, reed, shake, bassey)  I get that there's no single high quality asset in here (besides potentially simmons), but it's more of a quantity over quality kind of thing. It's not a homerun offer, and it's quite possible (but not guaranteed) that they would be outbid, but it's a decent-ish offer."
"Shake has a bum ankle that's going to keep him out what sounds like week(s) so it's really Maxey and Joe's chance to shine early and take those roles (starting PG for Maxey and backup SG to Seth for Joe).  Isaiah Joe shot an admittedly unsustainable 60% from 3 in the preseason on pretty high volume (like 15/27 I think) and played great defense, and he's one of the few guys on the team comfortable creating his own shot so he's a real dark horse for a breakout year."
"Happy to see Maxey get more minutes? Hell yes. Happy to see Shake get more minutes? God no. Much rather see Maxey and Isaiah Joe back there.  Shake can't dribble the ball for shit in traffic, it's embarrassing, and he's a streaky shooter at best."
1. Romeo Langford.  2. Aaron Nesmith.  3. Robert Williams.  4. Jordan Poole.  5. Terrence Mann.  6. Jordan Nwora.  7. Isaiah Joe.  8. Mikal Bridges.  9. OG Anunoby.  10. Tyrese Haliburton.
Excuse me have you seen Isaiah Joe  I rest my case
"PG: Simmons  SG: Curry  SF: Green  PF: Harris  C: Embiid  Bench: Maxey, Milton, Korkmaz, Niang, Drummond.   I really hope Isaiah Joe ends up getting Korkmaz’s minutes though."
"Simmons (LOL), Maxey  Curry, Shake Milton over Isaiah Joe b/c Doc is Doc  Green, Korkmaz/Thybulle  Harris, Niang  Drummond, Embiid"
I guess we’ll see what happens when Isaiah Joe is shooting 70% at the end of the year
Isaiah Joe is the best shooter alive
Thybulle and Maxey aren't even the biggest argument. The biggest argument are guys like Isaiah Joe and Paul Reed that might be second and deep second picks with great value
Isaiah Joe and Drummond rounding out the top 10 just as we all predicted
I'm very confident that off the bench Isaiah Joe is gonna average ~6 3PA/game and shoot it at a ridiculously high efficiency.
"Honestly things would be looking real sweet right now if we could have avoided alienating our starting point guard at the end of last season.    Isaiah Joe shot ~60% from three on high volume over the course of four pre-season games. Kork looks like Olympic Kork. Maxey is continuing to progress as you'd expect, he played very well in SL and pre-season. Niang is going to be a *very* good addition for us, especially if we can eventually get Ben engaged and playing normally. He's the kind of stretch big we have been trying to get for years. Basically he replaced Mike Scott, but we'll actually play him because, ya know, he's still good. And Andre Drummond is the perfect backup for Embiid. He can get his in the post, play very good defense, pass a bit, and is still a monster on the boards. Also, and I didn't know how important this was, but he won't get a tech once every two games.   So yeah it all depends on how this Ben stuff works out. Maybe don't shit on players you still need."
paul reed and isaiah joe :)
Isaiah Joe
"If OKC would agree to make the sixers 2025 1st round pick unprotected, then the sixers will have all but 1 of their draft picks. Seth Curry is on a really good contract and he would be valuable to any tanking team purely to flip for draft picks.  And maxey, thybulle, isaiah joe, are all quality young players. Even Paul Reed, Shake Milton, and Jaden Springer have a bit of trade value. Are any of them elite prospects? Hell no. Notice I said ""decent war chest of assets"". Not the best in the league. There are teams with better war chests.   Let's say dame became available in a trade. The knicks, nuggets and warriors could probably all beat the sixers best offer. But would the knicks be willing to go all in on Dame this early into their rebuild? We all know what Lacob has said about wanting to build for the future. Now maybe the warriors would go all in on dame, but it would cost a pretty penny to beat the sixers offer, and it's not clear that they would do that. And would the nuggets be willing to offer murray AND mpj? They can't even trade MPJ until next year because of the poison pill provision."
"Well you add things to the trade beyond just Simmons. Philly has Maxey, Isaiah Joe, Thybulle, and draft capital to potentially sweeten any trade. You can argue over the value of those pieces but they are certainly worth something"
"ESPN: Isaiah Joe ""All the 'superstars' in this league trying to dress like me"", Doesn't See Them as Superstars"
He’s like a cross between Isaiah Thomas and Joe Ingles.
Isaiah Joe looks super solid
"Agreed, but in the playoffs Curry showed a talent at handling those situations, as did Maxey. And Isaiah Joe looks good at that so far.  The jump that Shake and Maxey make, if they make it, will be the deciding factor in playoff success."
I love you Isaiah Joe.
"Will the Nets need Kyrie to overcome Furkan Korkmaz and Isaiah Joe if they meet in the playoffs this postseason? Don’t get me wrong, KD and Harden are solid players, but it doesn’t look like they’re enough to move the needle against this 76er’s backcourt."
"Insane that Korkmaz and Isaiah Joe out dueling Durant and Harden is like the 4,900th weirdest thing to come out of these two teams recently"
Isaiah Joe clears harden honestly
Isaiah Joe is the best player in Sixers history
Isaiah Joe might be a player
I watch the players on this floor and wonder how does one stop Isaiah Joe?
"Love the young talent on this sixers squad. Maxey, bball Paul,  Isaiah Joe, Milton, korkmaz. Hopefully one of these guys makes a leap this year"
Isaiah Joe
Sleeper pick: Isaiah Joe
"Isaiah Joe sounds like the name for some kind of corporate mascot. On that alone, he deserves playing time."
I’ll be so depressed if isaiah Joe doesn’t get real minutes this year. So I’m like 99% gonna be depressed.
Should try to play Isaiah Joe
Isaiah Joe used to be 6’5” - 6’6”
"quitting on your teammates is real alpha dog shit for real lmao. The organization doesn’t matter they’re just a business but the guys on the team need you and you’re just not showing up? Not just the Embiids chasing a legacy but like, Shake Milton, Paul Reed, Isaiah Joe, these guys need the team to succeed, need a role on a strong team that performs well to get them another contract. Not talking about the dudes making 110 million, the guys making $2m and hoping they have another contract in their career so they can set their kids up for life. But I guess if the “fuck you I got mine” is alpha shit then"
"Derozan is only making the Hall if he plays long enough to accumulate enough points.  It would be a technicality and controversial.  Lowry is unlikely to make it unless the Heat win a title with him.  HoF's in their prime he beat in the East working backwards...Reggie Miller, Alonzo Mourning, Mutumbo, Webber in Washington in year 4 (clearly not as good as his Sacramento days so he can be ignored), Shaq in Orlando year 4 (again not as good as Lakers Shaq still much better than any player Lebron faced in the East), Patrick Ewing, Dominique Wilkins, Isaiah Thomas, Joe Dumars, Dennis Rodman, and Charles Barkley on the Sixers.  Many of these guys he beat multiple times.  He never beat the Celtics in the playoffs.  He lost twice and then was on opposite sides of the bracket going forward.  He lost to them with Bird, McHale, Parrish, Bill Walton, and Dennis Johnson in his 2nd and 3rd year.  Bill Laimbeer might make it.  Mark Jackson will eventually make it based on his stats.  Neither are all time greats, but they would be the equivalent of a Lowry or Derozan making the Hall."
"I’d think it’d have to be McDaniels, Bolmaro and Beasley to you plus 3 firsts from us. Maxey, Isaiah Joe and 3 firsts from Philly. Still, I think you could do better."
"they just need to relocate at this point. they've been doing shit like this ever since lebron was drafted. they let boozer walk away for nothing while being a rfa. they signed larry hughes over ray allen or michael redd. didn't want to trade jj hickson for prime amare stoudemire or iguodala. didn't want to trade kevin love for paul george in 2018 or they could have traded kyrie for middleton and bledsoe instead of getting isaiah thomas and  a bunch of make a wish kids. not to mention drafting luke jackson infront of josh smith and kevin martin. drafted dajaun wagner over amare stoudemire and caron butler. also drafting dasagna diop over joe johnson, zach randolph, richard jefferson and gilbert arenas. traded jamal crawford for chis mihm. drafting anthony bennett. the whole franchise is a joke"
"It's more similar when you look into it more.   The 76ers really don't want Ben to take developmental minutes from Maxey and Isaiah Joe. They know Ben isn't going to work in the playoffs anyway and the more minutes they can devote to Maxey gives them flexibility for when they eventually trade Ben Simmons. If Maxey keeps improving, he can be playable late in the playoffs if the 76ers get a good wing in return for Ben.   Wall isn't a long term solution and where he ends up is going to be due more to money rather than how good he looks playing this year. Ben playing wouldn't be a long term solution for the 76ers and they would still be looking to pull the trigger on a trade ASAP if they got something they wanted. If either plays, they are both getting limited minutes. Neither really wants to play for the teams they are currently on. Both playing basketball has a real chance of lowering their own values, whether intentionally or not - either with even a minor injury for Wall or if Ben continues to regress in shooting."
"Yeah, Tobias got Covid at the start of the month and then a week or so into the month Joel got it. Thybulle and one of our deep bench shooters, Isaiah Joe, also had it."
"Woah lmao calm down bro. It’s not a lie, a tech happens almost every night in the NBA. Look up the tech stats from last year, Isaiah isn’t even top 20 and there are numerous players who doubled his tech count. He had as many as that maniac… Joe Ingles"
"Obviously Simmons but lowkey a lot of Sixers fans hate Shake Milton too. He takes dumb shots and has a very low bball iq. He also takes away possessions from better younger players like Maxey and Furkan.   Part of this is Sixers fans love Embiid, Furkan, Niang, Maxey, Seth, Paul Reed, and Isaiah Joe to a borderline irrational extent so anybody else is viewed as lower than them. Even Tobias Harris gets some undeserved hate online."
"I like Isaiah Joe, but I don't have him above Ingles."
"You say ""G League team"" but the Sixers were legitimately playing well in the first half. They were shooting over 60%. Most teams playing like that in that position would be up by 5-10, not 19. But Seth couldn't miss and Maxey was making circus shots plus drawing the foul left and right. Even guys like Danny Green and Isaiah Joe were absolute snipers that first half. You have to give them a lot of credit."
I love Isaiah Joe
no greater symbol of the sixers injury and illness woes than isaiah joe getting 18 minutes in a game that isn't a blowout
Isaiah Stewart gonna be at the Lakers hotel fully dressed in the Joe Goldberg Stalker Fit from YOU 😂
"Legend has it, joe rogan gets his trt replacement from Isaiah Stewart’s blood"
"The depth on this team is absurd already.  “The Sixers could really use a point guard to split time with Maxey and Shake. Or a shooting guard to split time with Seth Curry and Isaiah Joe. Or a small forward to split time with Matisse, Furkan, and Danny Green. Or a power forward to split time with Tobias and Niang. Or a center to split time with Embiid and Drummond.”"
&gt;a simmering Sixers sophomore  can't wait to read about Isaiah Joe
"We also were missing Seth, Danny, Furk, and Isaiah Joe for games in that stretch."
"Meanwhile the Pacers (before this year) have drafted:  Cassius Stanley (cut after 1 year)  Goga Bitadze (a Center, when we already are starting 2 Centers, barely plays)  Aaron Holiday (traded him after 3 mediocre years for a pick upgrade to get Isaiah Jackson)  Alize Johnson (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Houston)  TJ Leaf (absolute trash)  Ike Anigbogu (barely played, cut after 2 years)  Georges Niang (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Philly)  Caris LeVert (pretty good pick, but we traded him)  Myles Turner (hey, we got one right)  Joe Young (barely played, cut after 3 years)  Solomon Hill (left after 3 years, was ok)  Miles Plumlee (played 14 games here)  Kawhi Leonard (awesome pick, so obviously we traded him draft night)  Davis Bertans (another good pick we traded draft night)"
"After the starting five of Maxey, Green, Curry, Tobi, and Jojo. We have Drummond, Korkmaz, Shake, Niang, Matisse all in the rotation. Plus we also occasionally run out some promising young guys in Bball Paul and Isaiah Joe. The Sixers are 10 deep without Simmons, and there’s some fringe guys who would get decent burn if they weren’t on a team trying to compete."
"Good for Lonzo, it’s become so rare to actually take it. Isaiah Joe took one last night and I loved it"

Isaiah Joe &gt; shake
"I like your draft picks there and Maxey, that’s really it. Thybulle is good on a contending team not a tanking one,. Isaiah Joe sounds like he could be a possible decent role player that’s it. The Knicks if they offer Barrett, Toppin, Quickley and some first plus salary fillers I’m taking that over the 76ers deal. I’m not saying you guys don’t have assets I just think the blazers would prefer extra 2-3 picks instead of Simmons along with your young guys and someone like Barnes or Buddy who’d be an expiring contract if you guys want Lillard."
"&gt; There is a chance teams see Simmons as a negative asset with how much of a dumbass he’s being.  I've never bought this line that teams are particularly turned off by ben forcing his way out. I've literally never heard anyone say this before about another star forcing their way out. I think most people would be shocked if the timberwolves wouldn't at least offer expirings + a few firsts for simmons, and that's clearly positive value.  &gt; Because other teams can beat you what assets do you have outside Simmons.  Besides our young players like maxey, thybulle, isaiah joe? The sixers are only missing 1 draft pick. Before you say ""the sixers are good so their draft picks are worthless"", the nets are really good and they got james harden for basically just draft picks."
"The Sixers lost back to backs to the Knicks and Bucks without: Embiid Harris Danny Green (for one game) Seth Curry Isaiah Joe  Literally 4/5 starters missing. And they played insane basketball. Took both the Knicks and the DEFENDING champs down to the final two minutes (Bucks game was especially tight). Even with a healthy crew, Sixers are moving the ball really well. 4-5 guys in double digits nightly.   The team is so different without Ben and clearly it's for the better."
The one thing is that we have a lot of shooting and could help a team out in a ben trade. Like throw in seth or isaiah joe. This deal still ain't happening tho.
"Could make a pretty great team from the inactive list for this game  MIL: Donte DiVincenzo, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Sandro Mamukelashvili  PHI: Grant Riller, Isaiah Joe, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Ben Simmons"
"Plus we’re missing Embiid, Harris, Simmons, Thybulle, Isaiah Joe, and now Seth has a foot injury that kept him out tonight. It’s a weird time right now."
You spelled Isaiah joe wrong
"Not just best 4, but Matisse and Isaiah Joe who are important rotation players too"
"Do we even have enough players for this game to be played? We're down Embiid, Tobias, Simmons, Matisse, Isaiah Joe, and now Seth.    That leaves Maxey, Niang, Korkmaz, Drummond, Danny Green, Paul Reed, and Shake. Is Charles Bassey our eighth man or is he in the g-league? Either way, I hope these guys stay healthy playing so many fucking minutes since this is our fifth game in the last six days."
"4 players out with Covid, 2 starters and Thybulle, plus Isaiah Joe who ordinarily wouldn't be a big loss... but with Tobi, Jojo, and Tisse out... yikes.  We are now at 6 players out. But last season Silver specifically chose to force us to play with only 7 men available, so I'm pretty sure us being at a disadvantage just gives him a hard on or some shit."
ben maxey isaiah joe (underrated) and a pick or 2
"Mate we have like 8 players. If you can’t beat Maxey seth furk niang Drummond with literally only Shake, Isaiah Joe and Bball Paul on the bench you should relocate"
"We honestly have plenty of role players. I think the question is when do our role players + Simmons + picks equal a star player. Bc with curry, thybulle, korkmaz, niang, Maxey, shake, Drummond, Isaiah Joe the second unit is pretty damn good"
"Isaiah Joe for the Sixers is out for health &amp; safety now, too. I really hope this shit doesn't spread to the whole team. It took Curry months to get back to pre-Covid form."
"Morey has really built us a good bench. Our 4 highest paid players have missed time, but we have 9 other guys who deserve minutes.   Curry, Maxey, Matisse, Niang, Korkmaz, Drummond, and Shake have all played well. Isaiah Joe and Paul Reed haven’t played much, but I believe they can contribute with more playing time.   I’d love to see Simmons come back, dress for games, ride the bench, and watch his teammates win without him. It’d never work out like that, but I can dream."
People don't really talk about it but Sixers have a ton of very good 3pt shooters. They play through a big so it looks different but they have plenty of people who shoot high percentages. They also have Isaiah Joe who could be another shooter if he actually gets real minutes to develop.
isaiah joe &gt;  shake
I'm amazed there's a person named Isaiah Joe
Isaiah Joe has a negative PER? I didn’t know that was possible
I would trade Ben Simmons and Isaiah Joe for FVV and Dragic right now.
