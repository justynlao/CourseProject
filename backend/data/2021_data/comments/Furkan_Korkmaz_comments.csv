Furkan Korkmaz   He hit back to back shots with less than 3 minutes left in a one possession game. He had 17 points. He was a big reason why we beat a very good Pacers team without Embiid.
"Hard to stop our two most clutch players, Furkan Korkmaz and Matisse Thybulle."
"I don't think we are a top 3 seed like some suggested, but we were 6-4 before COVID hit and that was without Porziņģis.   We've also had the 5th hardest schedule thus far. (From here on out we have the 2nd easiest schedule).   No other team in the league has lost 6 of it's best players for half the season. Philly has missed Seth Curry for 7 games and then Mike Scott and Furkan Korkmaz. Hardly the same as missing 4 starters and our 7th man.   Then you have teams like Memphis and Boston who got their games postponed. Meanwhile we had to play games missing half of our rotation guys and starting rookies, 12th men in the league, and G-Leaguers."
"Big difference between missing Seth Curry for 8 games, Furkan Korkmaz and Mike Scott vs missing Kristaps Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell, and then have Tim Hardaway Jr play through injury."
"That’s what the problem is. We know that Simmons cannot be the main ball handler for a championship team, so that duty is delegated to dudes like Tobias Harris or Shake Milton or Furkan Korkmaz, who are simply not good enough offensive engines."
"i think it happens all the time.   for some reason it came out that Korkmaz had demanded a trade 3 years ago before he got any minutes.   Like Furkan?  wtf you doing.    Not sure why that became public, but it did and was pretty funny."
"We will introduce you to our Turkish delight, Mr. furkan korkmaz"
Refs have to make sure (Furkan Korkmaz) gets free throws in case he misses the layup
We've played 17 games so far.  * Mike Scott (missed 9) * Shake Milton (missed 3) * Furkan Korkmaz (missed 12) * Matisse Thybulle (missed 3)
If you let Furkan Korkmaz yam on you like that you need to retire right there
The last Sixer player to demand a trade was Furkan Korkmaz
This seems like a good time to bring up that the last 76ers player to request a trade was Furkan Korkmaz lmao.
Furkan Korkmaz. He’ll never crack the top 8 in a rotation consistently.
Furkan Korkmaz is a bad player lol
"&gt; At the end of the day, a team can’t win a championship with Tobias Harris as its second best scorer and Shake Milton or Furkan Korkmaz as the secondary ball handlers.  Why not?   Our team this year actually built around Simmons strengths and Embiid's influence on the defense.   If Seth Curry and Danny Green get hot at the right time we are one of the best teams in the league.  Great defense and 3 pt shot making/creating with a dominant interior presence.  Meme all you want but Simmons is arguably the best player at getting his teammates good looks from 3.  The problem has always been we werent able to spread the floor enough for him to do it especially in the playoffs because him and Embiid arent a great fit.     Outside of shooting a tad bit better, Simmons is similar to Giannis.  The difference being one team has a top 3 center and the other doesnt so they were able to build a more functional team around what Giannis does."
Furkan Korkmaz might have the most effortless and convincing pump fake in the league. Looks exactly like his shot until the ball doesn’t come out of his hand
"And there are that many guys who were deemed close contacts to Curry. Half of the Sixers roster is still missing. Included in that are Mike Scott and Furkan Korkmaz, who were already out with injury."
"yeah by my count it leaves 7 players available: Simmons, Maxey, Dwight, Isaiah Joe, Terrance Ferguson, Tony Bradley, Dakota Mathias  (Mike Scott and Furkan Korkmaz are injured)"
Furkan Korkmaz Shoots a 3   Marv - *Dwight Howard with a SPECTACULAR JAM!*

"Probably Furkan Korkmaz for the Sixers. I think they protect Maxey, Embiid, Simmons, Harris, Curry, Green, Milton, Thybulle. Could flip Green and Korkmaz though. Dwight is still good too."
"Bagley's 44% true shooting is basically worthless for a 76ers team that finally has shooting. Plus, his contract isn't even cheap because he was picked second. Furkan Korkmaz is probably the best match."
"RoCo, Steven Adams, Russ, Furkan Korkmaz, Clint Capela.... technically Gerald Green (FOR NOW HOPEFULLY)... Embiid, Wenyen Gabriel, Jeff Green,  K-Love, Ja, Sabonis, KAT... I think that's most of them. No specific reason just dudes I like"
"Deni is 20 years old and has a Gorani Muslim father. He's not the one pulling the trigger, and he was never even in the IDF by virtue of Israel's mandatory service laws (he got an exemption because of basketball).  Furthermore, Holocaust Remembrance Day is important to *all* Jews the world over. Avdija is the only Jewish NBA player I am aware of, and trying to tie his remembrance to crimes currently being committed in a country where most of the world's Jews don't even life is *very* antisemitic.  Nobody tries to claim that Furkan Korkmaz bears responsibility for the Turkish invasion of Northern Syria, or that Gorgui Dieng needs to answer for the actions of Islamic terror groups. So unless Deni starts publicly speaking in support of Israel's occupation, why does Deni need to answer for their actions? Deni may be Israeli, but here, Israel is irrelevant to the conversation."
"i don’t think u understand. furkan korkmaz won a dunk contest with a dark vader mask on. i’m sorry but DAJ just can’t compete. smart, a first and a hand wave to the salary cap for korkmaz SEND IT IN"
i personally think furkan korkmaz would be the sniper boston needs 👍🏻
Furkan and Korkmaz
All this to beat Furkan Korkmaz in the Finals
Furkan Korkmaz but only when he wears the big yellow shoes that kinda make him look like a cartoon duck
One Zach Lavine for Furkan Korkmaz pls
If furkan Korkmaz was averaging 23 more points per game he'd be leading the league in scoring

1. Joel Embiid 2. Ben Simmons 3. Tobias Harris 4. Shake Milton 5. Danny Green 6. Mattise Thybulle 7. Seth Curry 8. Dwight Horward 9. Furkan Korkmaz 10. Mike Scott  Haven’t seen George Hill yet but I’d imagine he slides in right under Seth
Furkan Korkmaz
All this to beat Furkan Korkmaz
Furkan Korkmaz
The Knicks can trade for Furkan Korkmaz giving the Sixers a future 2nd round pick.
There is one upside. Furkan Korkmaz or some other 3pt-shooting role player would average 30 even if Embiid can't do his thing. Just imagine the memes.
Turkey:  1. Hedo Turkoglu 2. Mehmet Okur 3. Omer Asik 4. Furkan Korkmaz 5. Enes Kanter 6. Ersan Ilyasova 7. Cedi Osman
Furkan Korkmaz and Matisse Thybulle
Furkan Korkmaz.
"Furkan Korkmaz has looked awesome the last few games. I know that he's an extremely streaky player, but it feels like this might be a bit of a breakout for him, especially as it's not just 3 shooting but even defense  Though he probably still gets thrown in as trade bait at the deadline either way, it's still nice to see"
Steph Curry is the American Furkan Korkmaz
Cool.  Your team just got rode on by Furkan Korkmaz and Shake Milton.
"For those wondering, Furkan Korkmaz is:  2/14 (14%) at Driving floating jump shots  0/4 (0%) at Floating jump shots."
"Let's go through our bench.  Dwight Howard: Very solid backup Center in limited minutes. Strong on D, okay on O with quite a few dumb mistakes. Count on 8 points, 12 boards and 4 Fouls (with 2 of them being Offensive)  Shake Milton: Supposedly our 6th man. Started season very hot, hurt his ankle and has not been able to hit the broad side of a barn since. Always been a streaky player, but this is exceedingly cold. Had a nice bounce back later in the game, but still a bad shooting game.  Furkan Korkmaz: The most divisive player on the bench. He's just as likely to go off for 25 points and 6 3s as he is to turn it over 6 times in 8 minutes. Goes ungodly cold and nuclear hot at random, but also likes to play like he's Lebron for some reason. Liability on D, but active enough that he can sometimes cheese a steal.  Matisse Thybulle: Legitimately one of the best defenders in the NBA, but is having a horrendous offensive season. Shooting something like 35/25/60. Gets plenty of play because he's good for 3+ steals in 12 minutes, but really bogs down the offense.  The rest of the bench are all pretty much scrubs or rookies that will not see play in the playoffs."
"I see no reason, barring injury, the Sixers can't run it back next year as well. Embiid will be 27, Simmons 25. The only major expiring contracts are Furkan Korkmaz, Danny Green, and Dwight Howard. Surprisingly, legitimately everyone else is signed until the 2022-23 season."
I seem to recall morey actually did try to trade for him i hear the asking price was furkan korkmaz and a second
"Furkan ""Turkish Bomber"" Korkmaz dunks better than these cats"
--Furkan Korkmaz
"This is kind of my point. Assigning credit or blame to one particular person is an impossible exercise. Morey deserves credit, Doc deserves credit, Furkan Korkmaz deserves credit, everyone deserves some level of credit/blame"
"17 in the first for Trae. Who does he think he is, Furkan Korkmaz? great first Q for Atlanta"
"1) Does this account for the COVID games where we basically suited up 7 active players and lost two games by a combined 30 points? Not to mention Seth Curry has been struggling post COVID. He was shooting 50/50/90 prior to getting sick. Obviously the chances of sustaining that are low but the breathing issues have made him very hot/cold.   2) We will see, the Raptors team defense slowed him down. But can other teams replicate their strategy? Very few players/teams are capable of guarding him. It's really on Embiid's conditioning and focus.  3) I'm curious what the difference is when Embiid plays verse when he sits. I am worried about this over the season. We can not rely on Danny Green/Furkan Korkmaz to spread the floor as they are very streaky. Along with the aforementioned Seth Curry issues.   4) Doesn't matter, we're in the Eastern Conference. It's meaningless to say we would be fifth in the west cause we're not.   My main concerns about the Sixers (outside of Joel's health) are the streaky shooting and travel woes. Tobias needs to show up in the playoffs. We're hoping Daryl can add a secondary ball handler/playmaker."
"Nah embiid was good. He was getting double and triple teamed so we lost to Furkan ""Steph Curry"" Korkmaz"
We need to cut the lead before they put their Superstar Furkan Korkmaz back in.
Is it fair to say Embiid is washed and Furkan Korkmaz is the leading MVP candidate?
"Get in on ""White Hot"" Mike Scott when you trade for Furkan ""The Shot's Always Workin"" Korkmaz! These trade pieces won't last!"
Furkan Korkmaz
It's like saying that Norman Powell is Raptors soul  Or saying that Furkan Korkmaz is 76ers team spirit  Or saying that Eric Paschall drives the warriors  Or saying that withou Dozier Nuggets ain't going anywhere  Or saying that Pat Bev makes your team chemistry  Lol
Your dunk contest is missing Furkan Korkmaz
"Maxey is good. And as for Isaiah Joe, there's basically non-stop #freeIsaiahJoe posts anytime Danny Green or Furkan Korkmaz are tossing up bricks"
"Hahaha, I hear you. You telling me they won’t be hyped to get a mint condition Furkan Korkmaz for the expiring corpse of their diminutive guard?? Unfathomable."
Well our starting PG and backup PG are out so we have a rookie or Furkan Korkmaz running the offense. Its ugly
Yeah we will take him off your hands for Furkan Korkmaz and Cash Considerations
"""Dear diary, Furkan Korkmaz is a meanie"""
"Furkan Korkmaz. When he’s on, he can look absolutely electric with one of the quickest jumpers in the league and surprisingly effective drives with dunking ability.   When he’s off, he’s an absolute dear in headlights"
Furkan Korkmaz. Please
"I'd say Hezonja. It is the only reason he still lurks in NBA. Hell, he even dunked over Giannis and blocked LeBron.  As far as I know, Pat Connaughton has the highest vertical among whites in draft combines.  Also people doesn't know since he is mostly 3-pt shooter in NBA but in Europe, Furkan Korkmaz was known for his dunks and even won a slam dunk contest."
"I mean our playstyle certainly doesn't generate too many 3s. But I've seen Tobias pass up on so many open looks from deep it makes me angry, similar story for Seth and Danny- They're great shooters and yet we have Furkan ""Michael Jordan"" Korkmaz taking mid range shots off the dribble instead of drawing up plays for the other 2."
We need to take more threes. We have fucking seth curry and danny green and we have god damn furkan korkmaz shooting mid ranges off the dribble
"He’s not really a particularly good power forward.  He probably could be great and probably will end his career there, but his bread and butter is forcing awkward defensive switches and collapsing defenses off of cuts and dribble drives, putting him at the 4 minimizes his ability to do either so oftentimes even when he’s nominally playing the 4 he’s more or less playing a point forward or effectively a 3 guard offense with a small forward, usually Furkan Korkmaz, doing most of the work that would be done by the Sixers power forward in their offense."
All fun and games til Book is in the same scenario guarding Furkan Korkmaz who will drop 40 on his head with Kendall wearing the coveted #30 Philly jersey.   The cycle will continue for eternity
"Doc didn't play known Blazer killer Furkan Korkmaz in the clutch. Had he played him, this would be a Sixers W."
"They didn't play Furkan Korkmaz, known Blazers killer. They deserved to lose this game."
"That's a misleading title... Should've been ""Furkan Korkmaz dunks while barely guarded"""
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
"https://streamable.com/d0stm  This shot vs Philadelphia last year, and then FURKAN KORKMAZ got a 3 off to win the game"
i also wish Furkan Korkmaz would wake up tomorrow with the same game as game 6 Klay Thompson. it's probably time to just focus on what Simmons is. the conversation with him is uniquely unfair. the guy was all-nba and all-defense last year.
"Have you seen the rest of the roster? Seth Curry, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz are all pretty terrible defenders  Also what do you mean Jazz defense is better? Sixers have the 2nd highest team d rating per NBA.com this season to the Lakers"
Can I get Furkan Korkmaz? Thanks in advance
Furkan Korkmaz... I love thar kid
Sixers/Heat got flexed to primetime on ESPN just so everyone catch watch point guard Dwight and elite scorer Furkan Korkmaz play 30+ minutes
Furkan Korkmaz
"The league will really be fucked when Furkan Korkmaz gets totally unleashed on the team with Ben, Joel and  Matisse fully formed..."
Furkan Korkmaz surely
Furkan Korkmaz
Furkan Korkmaz
average? gonna have to go with Furkan Korkmaz.
furkan korkmaz disrespect
"Furkan Korkmaz does essentially this, but not midair, on most of his shots and they’re more likely to go in than the ones he catches and dips"
Our offense is pretty  balanced after Joel and Tobi  Ben Simmons - 14.6 ppg  Shake Milton - 13.3 ppg  Seth Curry- 12.2 ppg  George Hill - 10 ppg  Furkan Korkmaz - 9.6 ppg   Danny Green - 9.5 ppg  Tyrese Maxey - 7.5 ppg
Furkan korkmaz 😎
Turkey Curry = Furkan Korkmaz
Most improved is obviously Furkan Korkmaz
I mean that still means they were able to be traded. When Furkan Korkmaz demanded a trade from the sixers a couple years ago we drew the line
championship **IF**  we assume the same development path for furkan korkmaz
The nation deserves to witness Furkan Korkmaz.
"Yes, that will be an issue, but like? Not my point still. There’s so many worse defenders than him. Furkan Korkmaz is going to get targeted when he’s on the floor too, and again, not even a truly terrible defender, just very limited."
Furkan Korkmaz
"Since we're jinxing players I just want to say Furkan Korkmaz will never win MVP, DPOY, and FMVP in the same season"
Furkan Korkmaz and Matisse Thybulle
"Sixers have a great bench. George Hill, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Matisse Thybulle, Dwight Howard, Mike Scott."
"Shake Milton and Furkan Korkmaz, more specifically Furkan."
Kinda weird that KD and Harden are dodging furkan korkmaz but I do understand
"You mean Furkan ""Kyrie Irving"" Korkmaz?"
"You put Cade in the best position to succeed. Make Garland and Sexton both available and trade the one you get the best offer for. See if there's a way you can get a young big (go hard after John Collins) and depth that has played in a structured system (try to get guys like Georges Niang, Jarrell Brantley, Furkan Korkmaz, Monte Morris, Semi Ojeleye). Prey on teams that might be looking to shed salary around the margins to go after FAs or cut their luxury tax bills.   In short, go all-in on Cade and surround him with players that aren't going to be the problem. Also, you need a new coach, someone like Charles Lee. Hire him."
"no, furkan korkmaz"
Furkan Korkmaz got them shook.
Ducking Furkan Korkmaz as per usual.
Embiid-29.6  Steph-30.4  Matisse-3.9  Paul Reed-2.7  Furkan Korkmaz-9.2  75.8 PPG.
PG - Tobias Harris  SG - Ben Simmons  SF - Joel Embiid  PF - Seth Curry  C - Furkan Korkmaz   Checks out to me.
Furkan Korkmaz joins Matisse Thybulle in having more points AND more threes than Trae Young in this game. Young is even getting shown up by some of his own teammates.   Single most overhyped player in the league.
"When Turkey loses a soccer match, you know Furkan Korkmaz is going to pop the fuck off the next game"
Yes 100% hopefully the Bucks are able to trade Middleton for Furkan Korkmaz this offseason
"&gt; You think fans are worse because you don't identify as an athlete,  i literalyl played soccer at youth level in brazil with huge crowds on multiple occasions, lol. the level of play was never as relevant to my personal experience as a bunch of grown man threatening to beat me and screaming (the most creative they could come with) personal insults 2 meters from me in the crowds. crazy, huh? playing against a huge hateful crowd gets the adrenaline pumping much more than playing against a top tier team in a library - simple as that.  &gt; Dude, I have professional basketball players in my family, I have known 30 plus d1 players, many of whom played over seas too. College arenas get as loud as those over seas one, too.  americans being excepcionalist and thinking their version of something is the most special, the most hardcore, the one with most pressure, lol. colour me surprised. and your version of the story completely ignores all i mentioned about how those players are coming into the league and europe, in their and their families countries, taking it completely seriously and professionally. nba players that go to europe are taking a downgrade / admitting failure, so from their perspectives, of course they are not going to see it as much pressure. and yes, ""not being good enough"" is a certain type of pressure, but that's not what we were talking about here - luka and giannis are not even close to not being good enough.   &gt;  there is no argument otherwise.  what a shitty way to end a reply, btw - specially since it's pretty fucking clear you are going to argue forever for the sake of arguing and make up stories about dozens of imaginary basketball players that played in europe and talked to you about this subject specifically, just not to give in. and you are a type too common on the internet.  and well, [argue with them](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1895785):  &gt; Nicolas Batum  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in France  I've played EuroLeague games where it gets pretty crazy. Serbia, Turkey, and Greece are the top three in my mind. My first NBA game, I had to play against the Lakers in Staples Center against Kobe (Bryant) - MVP Kobe. **Coach (Nate McMillan) was like, 'You won't be scared to play against Kobe in front of 20,000 people, will you?' I was like, 'Coach, I've played in Greece, in Belgrade … this will be nothing compared to that.'**  It's just different. The atmosphere is crazy. Panathinaikos, Partizan Belgrade, Fenerbahce, those places. The first EuroLeague game I ever played in Turkey, they had protection over the benches, and during the timeouts, while my coach was talking, all you could hear was things hitting the shield, like, 'bap, bap, bap.'   &gt; Bogdan Bogdanovic  Current team: Kings Played for teams in Serbia and Turkey  Here (in the NBA), there are lots of fans of individual players. **Over there, it's more about the teams. There are different cultures in every league in every country there. It's unbelievable. The fans there really take it personal, like they are in the games. They are really nervous and mad in the games like the players. But to me, that makes it nice to play there, even on the road. It's a different kind of pressure. You have to experience it for yourself.** For me, I'm used to it, so playing in a game where fans are throwing coins or lighters or phones is nothing new. Over there, it's normal. They're pointing lasers in your face while you shoot free throws.  &gt; Willy Hernangomez  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in Spain  When I was playing for Madrid, we had a EuroLeague game in Turkey. I'll always remember this: That I was warming up before the game, and I lost the ball, and it bounced and rolled all the way to the stands, and I remember, I didn't even think about going to get the ball like here (in the NBA). The fans there are really crazy. You really feel scared sometimes. There's no way here I would feel (scared) like that. The people there really support their teams and you have to respect them, but sometimes they also cross the line.  **There are some arenas here that are really quiet, you don't even notice people are there, so for us (who have played in Europe), not that the NBA is easier because you never want to say easy, but maybe getting used to the crowds there doing everything crazy, makes it easier for us to focus on the game here. Here, we don't even have to pay attention to the fans.**  &gt; Furkan Korkmaz  Current team: 76ers Played for teams in Turkey  **They will talk shit about your family, and not like here. About your mom, your dad, if you have sisters, they know everything. They will Google stuff about your family, and I was still really young when I played over there, so think how crazy that is.**  &gt; Frank Ntilikina  Current team: Knicks Played for a team in France  My craziest memory was the (2016) EuroCup final against Galatasaray. The away game in Turkey, I remember walking to the locker room before the game and the walls were shaking because the fans were already so crazy inside. We (SIG Strasbourg) couldn't hear our coach talking in the locker room, because of the fans in the arena.  &gt; Joe Ingles  Current team: Jazz Played for teams in Spain and Israel  Serbia and Turkey were always the craziest, but I remember in Greece one year, in Panathinaikos, someone threw a plastic cup of Coke at us during a timeout, and it landed right on our coach's whiteboard while he was drawing up a play. That's pretty funny, but it wasn't funny at the time. He was pretty mad, but what are you going to do? They don't kick people out for that stuff there or try to find out who did it.  One of my teammates, I don't remember if it was a lighter or a thick coin, but one of my teammates one year got his head split open from someone throwing something. But then there's a good kind of crazy, too. Maccabi (in Israel), where I played, no one was throwing anything, but to have 15,000 people love being such a part of the game, it was wild.  &gt; P.J. Tucker  Current team: Rockets Played for teams in Israel, Ukraine, Greece, Italy, and Germany  **There's nothing like Greece and Turkey. Israel's pretty turned up, too. But yeah, over there, it's not like fans. It's like gangs. It's like hoods. It's about where you're from, and they take it very personal. They love - love - their teams. When I was in Greece, I played for Aris, and when we played PAOK, I had to have a security detail, because it's a big, big rivalry in Thessaloniki. It splits the city. When we played, it got so crazy that they shut the fans out and we had to play a game (later) that season with no fans (in the arena).**  I played a game in Turkey where fans were lighting coins - like using a lighter to light the coins - then throwing them at us.  &gt; Goran Dragic  Current team: Heat Played for teams in Slovenia and Spain  I've played a lot of games in Belgrade and other places where if you're not careful, you can get hurt. They throw crazy stuff. I've been a part of one game in Olympiacos (Greece) where they threw oranges on the court. I never found out why. In Belgrade, they just throw coins and lighters. In Europe, most of the arenas, they put a protection, like a tunnel, behind the benches, so players don't get hit. When you're sitting on the road bench in Europe, all you hear is 'tick tick tick' - things hitting the tunnel. It's part of it. You get used to it.  One game I played in Croatia, in Zadar, and they have this organization of fans that are really crazy. We had an incident where one of our players got in a fight with a Zadar player, and these fans broke onto the court, and we just took off, we had to run (away) to the locker room in the middle of the game. I was only 16 at the time.  It's funny you know, over there, when you're on the road, you don't know if the security guys are with them or if they are going to protect you."
Kawhi for Furkan Korkmaz who says no
Furkan Korkmaz sounds like something a Mormon father would say instead of swearing in front of his kids
FURKAN. KORKMAZ. FUCK YOU ATLANTA
Tonight will be the game we stop looking at furkan korkmaz as a decent bench spark plug and begin looking at him as a top 10 wing player ever
Furkan Korkmaz
Furkan Korkmaz obviously
MERRY FURKAN KORKMAZ
"korkmaz means ""does not get afraid"" in Turkish so Furkan does not get afraid"
Hawks are really getting it handed to them by Philly's deadly guard/big combo of Furkan Korkmaz and Dwight Howard.
Hawks getting cooked by furkan korkmaz
Mother Furkan Korkmaz
"If you're interested in a slightly used Furkan Korkmaz and well worn Mike Scott, sure."
we gonna talk about fucking Furkan Korkmaz swatting the shit out of Okungwu???
Furkan Korkmaz will remember that
Furkan Korkmaz is just a fun name to say
Furkan Korkmaz gets 7 consecutive points for the 76ers and Doc Rivers rewards him by benching him lmao
"Probably not. We have 3 or 4 guys on our bench who are better or equal to him in how they impact the game. (Dwight Howard, Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle, George Hill). I might trade Korkmaz for him (though that’s close because I REALLY like Furkan) I would trade Shake Milton for him with no hesitation."
1. Joel Embiid: No 2. Ben Simmons: No 3. Tobias Harris: No 4. Seth Curry: No 5. Danny Green: No 6. George Hill: No 7. Dwight Howard: No 8. Matisse Thybulle: No 9. Furkan Korkmaz: No 10. Tyrese Maxey: No 11. Shake Milton: Yes?

I can offer one Furkan Korkmaz
"""Thybulle.""  -Furkan Korkmaz on Twitter"
Furkan Korkmaz is a 70% free throw shooter but I've never seen him make more than 1/2
Furkan Korkmaz.
I like Furkan Korkmaz more
Clearly you've never heard of Furkan Korkmaz you noob
He’s 3rd behind Isaiah Joe and Furkan Korkmaz.
"Furkan hell, someone stop Korkmaz"
FURKAN MOTHERFUCKING KORKMAZ
Not too many opposing players i like more than furkan korkmaz
this sub had a post last year where almost everyone agreed they would rather have Furkan Korkmaz than Kuzma lmao
furkan korkmaz
Furkan Korkmaz
Furkan Korkmaz
You will trade CJ 1-for-1 for Furkan Korkmaz and you will like it.
"Trade Bledsoe or relegate him to playing off the bench.   Sign one of Duncan Robinson, Furkan Korkmaz.   S&amp;T Zo to Toronto for Gary Trent Jr or to Portland for Norman Powell.   Or re-sign Zo for no more than $15mil/year.   Re-sign Hart, Uncle JJ and guarantee Wenyen Gabriel’s contract for next year.   Cap space is a conspiracy theory.   Lock Zion and BI in a gym with Kevin Garnett and Gary Payton."
"""Furkan Korkmaz at the line... my mistake that's Ben Simmons""  Good riddance"
FURKAN KORKMAZ for most improved player
That’s future Bull Furkan Korkmaz to you
"Doc Rivers: “To me, the most interesting thing has been watching Devin Booker. I talked to Furkan (Korkmaz) and texted him, and I’m just so inspired by what Booker has been able to do, and I think there’s no reason why Furkan can’t follow that same path.”"
I was also hoping to acquire Steph Curry in a sign and trade for Furkan Korkmaz.    Gotta let Steph play with his better brother.
"Blowout three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  * Eric Paschall  Warriors get:   * Myles Turner  * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris LeVert  Pacers get:   * Ben Simmons  * James Wiseman  * Matisse Thybulle  * 7th overall, 14th overall from the Warriors  * 28 overall from the Sixers  * 2023, 2025 1sts from Warriors  * 2023 1st from Sixers   * Filler to balance the money (Smailagic, Mulder)  So:   Warriors effectively give up Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Mulder, Smailagic, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Turner, Sabonis, LeVert. LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."
"Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz + Firsts for a shooting wing please"
Furkan korkmaz a season or two ago lol
Furkan Korkmaz
[yes](https://www.google.com/amp/s/sixerswire.usatoday.com/2020/01/18/despite-trade-request-furkan-korkmaz-happy-to-still-be-with-sixers/amp/)
"I don't know if we would have made it past Milwaukee, but I definitely think we win the Atlanta series. Having him instead of a rotation of George Hill, Furkan Korkmaz and more Thybulle minutes after Danny Green went down would have been a huge upgrade."
Furkan Korkmaz
"Embiid was forced to do **so much** though. I don't think that's a fair point to take a lot of the onus off on the guy who refuses to shoot the ball or be aggressive and put it on the only guy on the team that's aggressive and plays at an MVP-level.   Other than Seth Curry, Furkan Korkmaz, Shake Milton, and Tyrese Maxey, of course, but none of those guys are All-NBA caliber players."
"Yes, Can is a very common first name and Korkmaz is also a very common surname. Furkan is also not that rare. Sorta like John Smith and Robert Smith."
Singling out Furkan Korkmaz is going to look silly.  Dudes about to get paid this off-season.
I don’t think its Furkan Korkmaz
"I couldn’t find anything saying they are related, but weirdly enough they were both born in Istanbul (I get it’s the biggest city in Turkey but still) and when I looked up “Can Korkmaz brother”, Furkan came up. That probably means absolutely nothing though and I feel like someone would know about their relation if it was true lol."
"NBA Legend Furkan korkmaz is that Turk, put some Respek on his name, that i probably butchered"
Trade him for Furkan korkmaz
"I’m cool with trying to compete and not just relying on picks and the lottery but I also question if a borderline all star (barely top 30) good center who has some struggles defensively is worth an ok prospect and two firsts one of which is top 10. But we’ve done what we’ve done, so now we need to maximize LaVine and Vucevic and hope Patrick Williams is as good as advertised. We need a new PF, wing depth, and a new PG (Spencer Dinwiddie, Furkan Korkmaz, Bobby Portis is the dream but we probably can’t afford all of them unless we trade Thaddeus for a first, and find a way to dump Satoransky and Aminu)"
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
You're missing Furkan Korkmaz - he's a UFA this year. My guess is if he was on the list he'd probably be in the 60s.
"Perfect and most realistic IMO: sign one of Spencer Dinwiddie, Lonzo Ball, or Devotne Graham on a medium sized deal. Have a decent prospect fall to us in round 2 pick 38, someone who can immediately contribute. Sign and trade markkanen to get something for him. Keep Theis, Temple, Green. Waive Arcidiacano, sign a forward and a 3 and D wing. Furkan Korkmaz or Tony snell. Also should be interested in Bryn Forbes"
not the worst but furkan korkmaz would average 50 in the cba  Only reason he isnt an MVP level player is because hes build like a stick.
Furkan Korkmaz is top 3 most fun names to say in the league
"There's been at least one sniper taking between 20-30 every year in the draft for a long time now, pretty remarkable:  **2020:** Desmond Bane (30)  **2019:** Jordan Poole (28 - arguable)  **2018:** Grayson Allen (21), Landry Shamet (26)  **2017:** OG Anunoby (23)  **2016:** Furkan Korkmaz (26)  **2015:** Bobby Portis (22)  **2014:** Bogdan Bogdanovic (27)  **2013:** Tim Hardaway Jr (24), Reggie Bullock (25)  **2012:** Evan Fournier (20)  **2011:** Nikola Mirotic (23)  **2010:** Off year - maybe Greivis Vasquez (28)?  **2009:** Darren Collison (21), Omri Casspi (23), Wayne Ellington (28).  **2008:** Ryan Anderson (21)  **2007:** Jared Dudley (22), Aaron Brooks (26), Arron Afflalo (27)."
What is the ceiling for Furkan Korkmaz?
"Get this: Ben Simmons actually had a positive +/- (+1), unlike everyone else on the team not named Furkan Korkmaz or Shake Milton. Idk if that's because he was benched early or what, but at least he has that going for him."
"Furkan ""plus seven"" Korkmaz"
Merry Furkan Korkmaz
I watching furkan korkmaz start and shoot multiple shots early in a game 7. Can’t believe my eyes
Has furkan korkmaz been starting all along? Furkan korkmaz is really starting a conference semifinal game seven?
Furkan Korkmaz definitely sounds like a Sacha Baron Cohen character name.
Furkan Korkmaz is a great name and that's the extent of my analysis
im a neutral for this series but im just here to cheer for furkan korkmaz
"People like to say that Danny Green sucks, but he really doesn't. And when his replacement is Furkan Korkmaz, that's a big issue."
"&gt;Ben is NOT a scorer.  There is not being a scorer, and there is being unable to score.   &gt;i believe that if Ben had the opportunity (i think Houston would have been perfect) to have a team built around him  Why would anyone want to expend the resources to trade for him, eat his massive contract, and then some more resources on top of that for ""the team around him""  &gt;rather than Joel Embiid  Won't a team with Simmons on it always be built around someone else since he can't be the primary star?  &gt; whatever team Ben Simmons goes to will need to build a lineup full of shooters that can hide Ben’s lack of a jumpshot  You mean like Seth Curry, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, George Hill, Joel Embiid, Furkan Korkmaz, Isiah Joe, and Shake Milton... all of whom are 35%+ plus 3PT shooters, most of whom are ~40%+ shooters....  &gt;hich would open up the lane for Ben **to drive and then either finish** or kick it out to a shooter.  They can already do this and Ben doesn't because he knows he's gonna get hacked at miss more FTs."
"The others just aren't talked about much. There's lots of guys that you just shrug and say ""seems fine...""  Will Barton, Alec Burks, Alex Caruso, Khem Birch, Torrey Craig, Gorgui Deng, Spencer Dinwiddie, Devonte Graham, JaMychal Green, Furkan Korkmaz"
Furkan korkmaz and pascal siakam
"&gt;stole Seth Curry, one of the best contracts in the league, from the Mavs for Josh Richardson, who they literally just gave away  Just because the Mavs FO is dumb doesn't mean Morey is a genius.   &gt;got Dwight, Embiid’s best backup so far, on a vet min   Because the Lakers fucked it up. But where is he now?  &gt;re-signed Danny Green and Korkmaz for very team friendly deals during a time when role players are getting absolutely paid for their shooting ability.  No other team was going to give Danny 10 million a year. Furkan is just a 3 point shooter."
"Thats nics. But has he talked to the real Godfather, Furkan Korkmaz?"
"Ah yes, the insurmountable Shake Milton and Furkan Korkmaz. It's a wonder Maxey ever saw the court at all with those guys on the roster!  You are being a clown level homer here. Maxey is a nice player, but he was worse than both Bane and IQ last year. Maybe he'll be a better player moving forward - still way too early to tell. But saying those guys would be buried on the bench but not Maxey is just laugh out loud level fingers in my ears homerism here."
Sounds like he will be a great backup to Tobias for us. Somewhere in the 10-15 minute a game range and could help off the bench. Looks like a chubby and taller Furkan Korkmaz.

Furkan Korkmaz actually
Not calling enough plays for Furkan Korkmaz… if we are finding bad decisions in the playoffs
"Isaiah Hartenstein, Furkan Korkmaz and THT have to many hard consonants for them to be pleasing in my ears"
I'm not 100% certain that Furkan Korkmaz isn't actually Sacha Baron Cohen.
Hedo Türkoğlu  Cedi Osman  Furkan Korkmaz  Mehmet Okur  Ömer Aşık
Furkan Korkmaz would basically be Kobe
Furkan Korkmaz had a 40 bomb I’m pretty sure
"Furkan Korkmaz had similar problems his first couple years.  Language/culture barrier was hard for him, but Al Horford was one of the earlier guys to really reach out and take him under his wing.  Now he has a full on bromance with Thybulle.  Losing the only coworkers you have an innate connection with would suck."
"Dude you just listed Seth Curry, Danny Green and Furkan Korkmaz as like prized assets?"
Weird way to spell Furkan Korkmaz

76ers have a shooter: Furkan Korkmaz!
He only got paid 5 million. That's the same as Furkan freakin Korkmaz. Could you guys really not sign him for that?
Furkan Korkmaz
2nd only to Furkan Korkmaz 3 years 15m
"If Mavs want to go aggressive this FA, they could have gone after Fournier (will probably wait it out) or Norman Powell (needs some convincing to leaver the Blazers), or they could've gone for younger guys (and probably cheaper but can still be developed) like Gary Trent Jr., Furkan Korkmaz, or Malik Monk. But Mavs wants to play it safe I guess because once bitten, twice shy. They played the waiting game too many times in the past and got nothing from it."
Man if you watched that series and came away with “furkan korkmaz blew it for the sixers” I don’t know what to tell you
why cant Furkan Korkmaz be a 1 or 2 option and be more aggressive?
Our options kind of in order of what I selfishly prefer   Lowry  Powell  Match offer on Lonzo:  -Keep Zo  -S&amp;T to Boston for Smart  -Chicago has nothing other than Thad Young that I’d want back so   Duncan Robinson   Reggie Jackson or Kelly Olynyck or Furkan Korkmaz or JaMychal Green  Dragic  Dinwiddie (meh)  Kemba (kill me)    Most of (except Lowry in the universe where the tempering police veto Lowry to Miami) — if not all — of these can be done while also re-signing Josh Hart and using the MLE.
Furkan Korkmaz
Qhh  cool cool. They were both definitely above average players. Olur was a solid starting center with a great 3 who would have been perfect in today's nba.   Turkoglu was a player who could do some of everything on the court but definitely was a less than average defender lol   I think Alperen will be the best Turkish defender ever but Korkmaz is actually now an above average defender himself and is getting better every year... I don't like enes and I think cedi has too much of an ego to properly ever develop. Furkan is already better than him.
Furkan played decent. Cedi is a spoiled brat. He was given the keys to team and he fucked up so bad. He also avoided a wide open Korkmaz several times probably due to jealousy that Korkmaz is in a better situation and playing better than him in the NBA.  Sad that Sengun didn't play much. Ugh national team was such a disgrace. Fuck that coach lol
"He plays nothing like Jokic, his comparison is more of a Furkan Korkmaz with a worst shot but better slashing"
This dude look like Furkan Korkmaz drawn with a crayon
I don't even need to Google Alperen Sengun because I already know his comps are Enes Kanter and Furkan Korkmaz.
Furkan Korkmaz max contract when? Asking as a Turkish fan...
"Furkan Korkmaz.  I'd love to keep him, but I just don't see it happening."
"Fred VanVleet, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid.   Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard.   If they brought back Korkmaz and Dwight, that would be a horrible team to face. The defence with FVV, Matisse, OG and Joel would be almost impenetrable."
1. Shake Milton  2. Furkan Korkmaz   3. Tyrese maxey   4. Matisse thybulle   5. Ben Simmons
"Furkan Korkmaz, remember that when he makes it rain on your team."
"Can you name the player with four wheel drive, smells like a steak and seats thirty-five..  Furkan Korkmaaaaz! Furkan Korkmaz!  12 yards long, 2 lanes wide, 65 tons of Turkish Pride!  Furkan Korkmaaaaz! Furkan Korkmaz!  Hyah Furkan, hyah!!  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PI_Jl5WFQkA"
Pretend I am Furkan Korkmaz whenever I throw a piece of trash out.
"Sixers are well poised for Ben to stay home.  They have Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton competing for minutes already, and then drafted Jaden Springer.  Milton is a legit nba player, and Maxey looks to be even better.    This is a Khawi Leonard-San Antonio holdout/injury situation.  Both sided need to call it a mental health break, like Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka did.    Considering Philly's bench also includes prospects they are high on and want to showcase for potential trades, like Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Bball Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, seems to me the Sixers can win on the court and develop at the same time Ben sits out.    If any of Chicago, Portland or Minnesota gets off to a poor start while the Sixers and Embiid chug along, philly's chances of getting Lillard, Lavine, or Edwards increases.    Edwards most likely, because KAT, Malik Beasley and Dangelo Russell and Jaden McDaniels all fit around Ben Simmons  better than Edwards if the Wolves were to trade for him.  Plus, Morey built a team lat year suited for James Harden, stands to reason the next best thing would be a prospect with Harden's skillset like Anthony Edwards.  ."
Not including UDFA here's my list:  1. Brown 2. Ingram  3.  Simmons 4. Siakam 5. Murray 6. Sabonis  \--------------- (tier of all star level guys - 2-5 feels pretty interchangeable)  7. Brogdon  8. D. Murray  9. Beasley  10. Buddy  11. LeVert  \---------------- (tier of quality starter level guys)  11. Furkan Korkmaz  12. Poetl  13. Zubac  \-------------------- (tier of quality rotation guys)  bleh
"I know this is an unpopular opinion but I don't consider having a high value on a 25-year old three time All Star with four years left on his deal unreasonable. So many trades that are suggested would leave the Sixers worse than they are currently. If that's the case then why trade him? Because you have to? I still contend that they do not have to.   They have his basketball playing rights for four years. He can show up and play or be fined heavily daily. And the notion that he is going to show up and be disruptive or intentionally play poorly is ridiculous. Not that you yourself have said that, that's just the conclusion people jump to even though it makes no sense. He's not gonna tarnish his reputation like that and nothing in his history or personality shows that that is something he would do.   Ben's side is saying this definitely won't happen, but the odds that he comes in, plays well, and the team is winning and everyone is having fun and he and Doc have a heart to heart etc. And he decides he wants to stay is not zero. We have seen players that were adamant about wanting a trade who ultimately stayed with the team before. The Legendary Furkan Korkmaz and Kobe Bryant spring to mind."
Furkan Korkmaz &gt; Ben Simmons and I'm not even kidding
"I didn't want Doc in the first place. I knew his reliance on bench units was going to fuck us up before he was even hired.  That being said, Ben has basically run a player and a coach out already. The disagreements on Sommons handling the ball likely lost us both Jimmy and Brett. And even though I dislike Doc, Ben simply hasn't done anything where he should have the pull to run another coach out of here.   Why are we pandering to a guy who hasn't shown the drive to improve offensively and has shrunk in multiple playoffs now? Does anyone care if Furkan Korkmaz doesn't like Doc?   Ben can pick the coach once he starts making jumpers."
Excuse me why not my man Furkan Korkmaz as well?
Rookie of the year Furkan Korkmaz?
The answer for all is furkan korkmaz
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
"This is so cherrypicked, the Sixers as a team shot over 40% from 3 that series.  And key difference here: we shouldn't hold role players and rookies to the same standard as a max contract point guard.  The fact that Simmons averaged only 2 more points a game than Furkan Korkmaz is a catastrophic failure."
Furkan “Mayor of Philly” Korkmaz
[matisse thybulle and furkan korkmaz are best friends (a wholesome thread)](https://twitter.com/mvptisse/status/1406631053171757057?s=21)
"I think Minnesota's hypothetical offer of Beasley, Bev, and up to 2 picks (could be 1 pick, could be a pick and a swap, you get the idea) still outbids them unless it's CJ *and picks.*  Beverley alone gives Philly a G *that can shoot* to stand in the corner instead of the dunker spot with Seth, Tobi, and Embiid. That gets them past Atlanta on its own. And he's a good defender against anyone shorter than 6'6"". And then you replace the Furkan Korkmaz/George Hill minutes with Malik Beasley and that's good spacing for Embiid"
Furkan Korkmaz and Metta Sandiford-Artest
"That's not what I'm saying.  Guess what, Embiid was 12-0 against the Knicks before this game.  Hell, Furkan Korkmaz was 10-0 against us until tonight.  The reason is that the sixers beat us 15 times in a row, and *that* happened because we sucked ass for years while they were a playoff team. Saying that ""ben simmons is 14-0 against the Knicks"" literally doesn't mean anything. Far more interesting stats are stuff like how Kemba was 0-28 against LeBron at one point. Or how Horford was 0-10 in the playoffs against LeBron for a while."
Furkan Korkmaz
Who does this guy think he is? Furkan Korkmaz?
Like a furkan korkmaz
Furkan Korkmaz
"Injured guard Shake Milton yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Furkan Korkmaz gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Tyrese Maxey yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Simmons hit the locker room door, current NBA great Joel Embiid hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Fuck it. Furkan Korkmaz
This is all moot until Furkan Korkmaz asserts his dominance.
Guys I just took a DNA test and turns out Furkan Korkmaz is my dad
"Yo keep deleting and posting this post game thread, I’ve got like 10 different things to comment about Furkan Korkmaz."
"No they just weren’t the highest quality I guess, maybe 720p or whatever. But they were obviously passable quality which made it annoying bc I know no one else is gonna clip a random furkan korkmaz dunk on a Wednesday lol   no one was gonna see that clip and be like NOPEEEEE TOO LOW QUALITY"
"Then why are the other bigs all so much more efficient in the pnr? And it's not because they have Ben to handle the ball, he's terrible as a pnr ball handler, it's hard to screen a defender when he never has to leave the paint. Ben is behind Shake, Maxey, Tobi, and Seth Curry in volume as a pnr handler while being way less efficient, once again near the bottom of the league in efficiency. If Mike Scott, Furkan Korkmaz, Dwight Howard, and Tony Bradley can all be effective rollers with Maxey and Seth as the best PnR ball handlers on the roster, why can't Ben?"

"Even Furkan Korkmaz signed for less than half this per year, and their career stats are surprisingly comparable."
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
Furkan Korkmaz and Mike Scott.
Well then Furkan Korkmaz almost qualifies so it makes it a bit less rare.
"&gt;The only way they get someone better than Simmons is if someone says “I want out and I want to go here”. Maybe that happens. But if they had a trade for a Lillard type guy, they would’ve done it by now. They don’t.   I agree with pretty much all of this.  &gt;The market isn’t there. And it’s not going to go up over time as this plays out.  This is where I disagree. Right now there are 29 teams in the NBA that are pretty comfortable with their rosters, at least for now, the Sixers being the one where it could look completely different in a few months. Right now no teams want to blow up their roster and nobody is desperate for Simmons. As a Wolves fan I'm sure you'd like to have him but you'd be pissed if you had to give up anything valuable to get him. Honestly, fair enough, right now you don't need him. Maybe your roster will turn as well as you expect.  All 29 teams are thinking that, but in this league some teams will not perform up to expectations. Once that happens, then teams are more uncomfortable, GMs start worrying about their jobs or star players asking out, that's when the market heats up. Survive a little discomfort now and I would expect the market for Simmons to be better in a month or two, worst case I don't see it being significantly worse.   &gt;The fact that Simmons not playing hurts the 76ers. They’re competing for a title. They can’t afford to lose him for literally nothing. Simmons can take the year off with no problem.  He lost a few paychecks and came back, I don't think it's as easy as you seem to portray to just give up millions of dollars. He could do it, I just really don't think he wants to.  &gt;Players hold the power in the NBA. It works best for everyone to be civil and work together. But Simmons has more of an option to make this ugly than the 76ers.  I'd say that certain players hold the power in the NBA. LeBron, Kawhi, KD, those guys can do whatever they want because every team in the league would pretty much give up whatever they could to get them. Again, I think Simmons is great, but he's not one of those guys.   Just as an example, [Furkan Korkmaz requested a trade](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/11/05/report-furkan-korkmaz-requested-trade-from-76ers/) a few years ago, and it never happened. Obviously, there's a gap between Korkmaz and Simmons, but again I'd argue that there's a gap between Simmons and the true superstars of the league. In short, not all players hold the power."
Even Furkan Korkmaz with the 26th pick in the 2016 draft has turned into a really solid pick.   Somehow we’re better at drafting in the 20s than we were in the top 5. Hopefully Springer can be the next pick in the 20s to eventually become a rotational player
I hope Furkan Korkmaz really explodes this season on the Sixers side.

"Will the Nets need Kyrie to overcome Furkan Korkmaz and Isaiah Joe if they meet in the playoffs this postseason? Don’t get me wrong, KD and Harden are solid players, but it doesn’t look like they’re enough to move the needle against this 76er’s backcourt."

“Mother” Furkan Korkmaz
Furkan Korkmaz
Holy Furkan Korkmaz that was amazing
"Wow, not many guys that can score on Furkan Korkmaz and Georges Niang."
"Agreed.  Ben (and Joel to a lesser extent) make three-point specialists look good and cover for them on D.   **JJ Redick** set the record for the oldest player to set a career high in ppg, then broke his own record the next year.    **Landry Shamet** was first team all-rookie with the sixers and hasn't matched any of his advanced stats from that season since (PER, TS, BPM, WS, VORP).    **Dario Saric** was a quality starter in his early twenties, second on a 50 win team in scoring and he has been a bench player after he left.  **Covington** is another guy who set all his career highs in philly.  **Furkan Korkmaz** was a free agent anybody could have had for the minimum but he's only a rotation player in Philly because Simmons covers for him on defense and sets him up on offense.  **Seth Curry** was a MLE signing who played on 5 teams in his first three seasons and has found a real home in Philly alongside Jo and Ben.  All these guys take at least half of their shots from three.  Ben is a tough fit and he shat the bed in the playoffs after he fell apart at the line but it's easy to forget he's a three-time all-star who made an all-nba team for a reason."
"Over the last 4 years the sixers have steadily declined in 3PA per game, finishing last season right around 27th.   We have one of the most dominate paint players in the league, and have just absolutely failed to surround him with players that space the floor.   Sixers fans have been quick to say buddy is lacking in defense or other aspects of his game, but we so desperately need a high volume shooter, I struggle to see how he would not immediately make our offense flow better.   Would love if they found a way to get him on the squad.   For reference - last year, Danny Green was our leading 3 point shooter in terms of volume at just 6.3 attempts per game. After that, it was furkan korkmaz and seth curry at 4.9 each. Then we have a steep drop off to Tobias Harris at 3.4 attempts per game.   Further, Danny Green's 6.3 attempts per game ranked him at 48th overall in total attempts, just .1 attempts ahead of John Wall.   All that is to say, Sixers fans should reconsider their desire to have Hield on the team. He's one of the best volume 3 point shooters in recent history."
"Buddy is furkan korkmaz with more of a green light, he doesn’t move the needle for a team that is theoretically trying to contend for a ring."
Furkan korkmaz being a legit 6ft7 is crazy for such a shooter
"For anyone wondering,  The 2016 Miami pick was Timothe Luwawu Cabarrot  The 2016 OKC pick was Furkan Korkmaz.  Both were just ahead of Siakam.  The Kings pick is when the swapped Tatum for Fultz. (I think)"
Matisse Thybulle is older than Furkan Korkmaz

We played and won this game without a SINGLE starter from last year. Furkan Korkmaz was our highest paid player on the floor (4.6 million….).

"&gt; but isn’t erdogan and the incumbent government a giant POS too?  Gulen isn't the opposite of Erdogan. Gulen wanted to be Erdogan but got beaten by him.   I can't find a direct example for USA but if i had to it would be like saying Trump is the opposition against conservatives. He just wasn't able to garner power.  Seculars in Turkey are the opposite of Erdogan. NBA players like Mehmet Okur, Furkan Korkmaz, Cedi Osman would be the actual opposition of him."
"&gt;&gt; Beyond Embiid, the Sixers’ combination of All-Star caliber players (Tobias Harris) and high-level role players (Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey, Georges Niang, Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Danny Green et al.) means there’s no need to take on more players of that ilk.

"In case anyone was wondering, they shouldn't have been, why they had never seen Furkan Korkmaz, or basically any other player, play 40 minutes in game 1 of a back to back followed by 45 minutes in game 2 of a back to back his performance tonight should clear that up for them."

Weird way to spell Furkan Korkmaz.
Furkan Korkmaz has made 6+ 3-pointers in a game five times in his NBA career. Three of those are against the Bulls.  Korkmaz made as many 3s as the Bulls today. 7/9 and 7/29 respectively.
