Want my favorite Rookie stat?  Killian Hayes has as many FTA as scoreless starts.
I‚Äôm convinced this idea that Luka is ‚Äúunathletic‚Äù is what drove the Killian Hayes hype.
"A ton of 1st round picks that are on the younger end of the spectrum spend a lot of time bouncing up and down between the 2.   For the Pistons last year, Sekou Doumbouya was the youngest player in the entire NBA. He had and still has his flashes of ability, but at 18 years of age he found himself losing confidence and had difficulty adjusting to the NBA style of play. When he went to Grand Rapids for a few days at a time, he played extremely well and learned how to play NBA ball just a little better.   If there was a regular G League season again this year, both him and Killian Hayes would be going back and forth to help them grow faster. Instead we're a little marooned and while Killian is injured Sekou has to learn in real time."
Better than Killian Hayes üòé
killian hayes
"You act like Killian Hayes is automatically a bust. Sure he had a rough start, and a really unlucky injury. But rookie PG‚Äôs are rarely good. Hayes can still be a great player, better than Haliburton even."
"Trade Kyrie for Depth? Kyrie for Derrick Rose, Sekou Demboya, And Killian Hayes ?"
"Washington and Houston for contract reasons, I assume.  I don't even see DET giving up Killian Hayes for Lonzo, tbh. Hayes at least has a potential ceiling still, and multiple years left on a rookie deal.  Elfrid Payton is probably the next-worst, and he's just been flat-out better than Lonzo this season."
Killian Hayes born later cause whatever he got right now ain't it
I'll throw Beal and Killian Hayes into the mix
"Team : Pistons  Rookies : Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart  &amp;#x200B;  Hayes looked really rough, his handles was bad, he looked pretty slow, he coukdn't make his step back 3's, some decent passes and played hard on defense, I still believe in the ceiling but the floor is super low  Bey : looks great as a shooter, pretty versatile and quick release, completly powerless from 2 for now, really solid defender one on one, moves his feet well, pretty sure he'll have a 10 years career as a 3&amp;D guy at worst  Stewart : plays crazy hard, not really skilled on offense, but hs shown flashes of good defensive potential, I dont like picking centers in the draft, but he's been as good as coud'vve been expected"
"Detroit Pistons are certainly your team. They‚Äôre the closest team to Canada, as you can see Detroit from Canada. They have two all-NBA players in Blake Griffin and Derrick Rose, which there are teams out there that have never had a guy make all-NBA.  Mason Plumpee is in his 7th season, which is a known notorious time for players to really make a jump in skill, so it‚Äôs possible they have another all-NBA guy soon. Jahlil Okafor is a former top 3 pick, and he might explode into an all-star soon as well. Between Griffin, Plumlee, and Okafor they average a whopping 28 points per game! Not only that, all 3 combine for 0.8 blocks a game, so they have some real dominant rim protection!  They have a rookie named Killian Hayes, who has exploded onto the scene and is the top rookie out there right now, potentially their 4th all-NBA guy. He‚Äôs already averaging 4.6 points per game, so by the time he hits Plumlee‚Äôs experience he‚Äôll probably be averaging 9 points per game! He shoots a blistering 28% from the field and 25% from 3 point land. This means that he hits roughly one out of every four shots he takes. Now that‚Äôs not quite Steph Curry level yet, it‚Äôs hard to envision him not getting to that level as a shooter going off of his promising start to his rookie campaign.  The fans are amazing and passionate fans. Ron Artest loved the fans in Detroit so much that he actually got a game stopped because he wanted to go socialize with the average Detroitian. They ended up fist bumping and having a great relationship even though it messed with the game.  So all in all, I don‚Äôt see a reason why not to go with the Pistons. The two already all-NBA guys are a great base, seeing Plumlee develop into one will be a treat, and I already explained how Killian Hayes may be the second coming of Steph Curry. I wouldn‚Äôt expect that much this year from them, but next year they are real candidates to break the all time wins record of 73-9, so you can hop on the bandwagon early and then when they take the league over you‚Äôll be one proud papa peacock."
"This is what Killian Hayes needs to do become serviceable:  Return from injury, lose the nerves, develop a killer mentality, become a league average shooter, limit his turnovers, learn to score at the nba-level, become a league average scorer, become a league average playmaker despite his lack of athleticism‚Äî maybe even learn to dribble with his right hand‚Äî, and then take every additional step to become a quality starter.  That‚Äôs bad value at 7. Also he told us that he could dribble with his right hand. I don‚Äôt trust him to self-evaluate."
Oof and Killian Hayes was already slow and not explosive
Maxey and Quickley have shown more already than the majority of guys picked in the top ten.   Like imagine drafting Killian Hayes (even before the injury).
He had the same injury that Killian Hayes has now too. Really hope he comes back ok
Killian Hayes is a bust
Killian Hayes
pistons. jerami grant. killian hayes. blake griffin. uhhh mason plumlee yea it stops there
"Losing to the disgraceful Orlando Magic. The Nets lost the trade, they're a first round exit. Trade Harden for Killian Hayes, Durant to Cleveland for Sexland, and banish Kyrie Irving"
Kevin O Connor has a lot of stake in that Killian Hayes pick as well
What do you think of Killian Hayes? I know it's early but he has struggled immensely
"You're saying the Rockets didn't like the package of Sekou Deyoumba, injured Killian Hayes, and dead Blake Griffin? Although if the Pistons were dumb enough they could have had a relatively attractive collection of picks"
"Killian Hayes, Seddiq Bey"
"Oof, Killian Hayes with the -7.0 Offensive RAPTOR and -7.3 Defensive RAPTOR."
My guess is Killian hayes
Killian Hayes too.
"Westbrook costs more money and has an extra year. I dont why they would want to bring him on when they already have Killian Hayes and Rose mentoring him. While Hayes could be out for this season, theres no reason why you would want to bring him in."
Detroit got Killian Hayes... 7th pick...
Imagine being a front office member that drafted Killian Hayes and watching Maxey ball out right now
Pistons: Surprising: Saddiq Bey and Jeremi Grant  Disappointing: Blake Griffin and Killian Hayes
This I agree. Though it seems your Killian Hayes is not that good. Should have drafted Hali instead.
I mean Josh Jackson looks pretty good too. I believe Killian Hayes has potential too but we'll have to see. He has to come back from injury and adjust to the nba game.

You think Ingram played as bad as Killian Hayes has?
Killian Hayes over Haliburton and Lamelo üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
"It's honestly a well-scouted class. Other than the funky case of Patrick Williams, basically every lottery prospect has the anticipated strengths/weaknesses.  If anything, I'm surprised there's no obvious busts. Killian Hayes has looked the worst, but rookie PGs often need time and anyone who watched him (and not just read KOC) knew he was raw."
"He's not projected to have superstar potential like LaMelo. He's seen as a top glue-guy / great secondary ball handler. Not a guy that you lead your offense, but help make it better.   He's not a guy who you give the green light to run your floor like Detroit did with Killian Hayes, but he's a guy who fits very well next to DeAaron Fox.   Honestly I was kinda surprised that the Hawks didn't draft him I thought he'd be a perfect fit next to Trae Young. But, the Hawks had enough cap space to sign a guy that's more developed and has the same comparison in Bogdan."
I never heard the injury concern--whats that about?  But yes drafting is a crapshoot. Also GMs and their extensive scouting and coaching networks overcook shit every year  and it's also exceedingly early to make calls like the Pistons definitely fucked up drafting killian hayes vs the kings drafting Hali.
"Imagine drafting Killian ""Literally Can't Dribble to My Right"" Hayes over this dude."
i watch killian hayes and weep
"Melo looks like not only a great passer, but the makings of a solid scorer who is just going through some rookie inefficiency. His three is already better than people expected.   His defense isn't good, but he's getting a shit ton of steals which is in correlation to the fact he just looks ready and capable of playing in this league.   Compare that to say, Killian Hayes, who even before the injury couldn't dribble a basketball to his right, and you see why people are loving him."
Killian Hayes.
They drafted Killian Hayes...
You might as well throw in Killian Hayes too...
"Lol no.   But they are a well coached, solid defensive team. And I like Cole Anthony. Better than some busts teams took before him (Killian ""I can only dribble one way"" Hayes)"
Killian was showing some flashes and was starting to look a little more confident in the most recent games IMO   So maybe short term they dont see that much drop off but I think in the second half not having Hayes will actually make them noticeably worse off
"Mo Bamba, Fultz, Killian Hayes...KOC shitting the bed on draft projections is one of my favorite sources of schadenfreude"
"I mean, KOC did swear up and down that Killian Hayes would never tear his labrum."
Yeah. You guys really suck at drafting man. Killian Hayes is the new edition. I mean as Clipper I shouldnt talk but damn they've missed on everything for more than a decade.
How dare you killian hayes played professional ball in *germany* AND he speaks french
Killian Hayes
"Yeah just like ignoring what you've seen from each rookie thus far is stupid too and that's why I pick Pritchard even despite him being 2 years older.   Why not throw Killian Hayes in this discussion if judging based off rookie years is ""extremely stupid""? He's younger than Maxey  And Simmons was better than Tatum in their ""rookie"" years because your guy had a year of NBA training and conditioning before playing."
Killian Hayes is gonna be a very good point guard. It's early
Everyone but Lamelo and Haliburton being negative isn‚Äôt surprising. Also lol Killian Hayes
I disagree with all my heart. MJ is a top 2 all timer. I'm now wondering if Killian Hayes (so far) is a bottom 2 all timer
Using Prime Michael Jordan gives absolutely no reference to Killian Hayes‚Äô numbers
Killian Hayes literally can't dribble to his right. Like I've seen middle schoolers with better two way handle.   How did scouts miss this shit so badly?   He can't play.
"Killian Hayes currently has a BPM of -13.9, which is comfortably the worst of any starter ever. Only one stat obviously, but not great."
Be honest.   Would you rather have drafted Tyrese Maxey or Killian Hayes?
Definitely not Killian Hayes lmao
Marvin Bagley. Markelle Futz. Killian Hayes.
Literally has shown more in limited minutes then Killian Bust Hayes
"No, but I'd be happy to have him as our 3rd string PG after Killian Hayes and Rose."
Killian Hayes is not your typical rookie. He played professional basketball in France and Germany. If anything he has an advantage over others in his draft class such as Wiseman who only played 3 games.
"Okay, we can have differences in opinion - I like hayes' passing but i think haliburton has shown more in very important moments of the game, with Killian he's had to be taken out in key moments a few times like game 1 against the wolves when they went to the zone."
Would love to see it. Grant looks like a great signing and Killian Hayes was my favorite player outta last year's draft. You guys are definitely building something special
"Pistons didn‚Äôt look bad at all against us. Their 3pt shooters can shoot, in Svi and Bey. Their high usage options can score, in Grant and Rose. We play a *lot* of guys who are below replacement level, the Pistons don‚Äôt play anyone who‚Äôs *super* below replacement level, which is how you really get to a 15 win season‚Äî there‚Äôs no rookie Kevin Knox on that team. (If Killian Hayes isn‚Äôt missing literally all his shots, Blake Griffin is actually looking like the worst bead on the string.)"
"For sure, really close and intense series. Before the draft I was really high on Saddiq Bey as a high-end 3&amp;D player and was hoping we'd take him with the 14th pick. His defense is already really good for a rookie and the guy was lighting us up from 3 along with Mykhailiuk lol.  You guys have a really good supporting cast of players already, if Killian Hayes figures it out over his rookie season then you might not even have to rebuild for too long anyways. I was also hoping the Celtics moved up to draft Hayes because he's gonna be a good playmaker - just needs to get used to using his right hand more."
"MVP Jaylen Brown, DPOY Jaylen Brown, ROTY Killian Hayes, MIP Jaylen Brown, COY That Monty guy"
I would consider highly skilled players to be more NBA ready than proejcts but either way Killian Hayes is neither athletic or highly skilled which is why I don't see his upside.
"- OG is not playing well - Jared Culver playing better but league probably doesn't believe it - Markannen has been totally acceptable but he doesn't seem as threatning as before - Devonte Graham has been atrocious on my fantasy team, so many 0-5 games already - Sekou Doumbouya and Killian Hayes have not played well - Mo Bamba virtually has no stock right now - Malik Monk virtually no stock - Dennis Smith Jr has no stock - Westbrook better turn the W's around, about to destroy his rep permanently - Literally nobody believes in Wiggins now - honestly James Harden's trade stock is unbelievably low for what he is - Nobody would pay much for D'lo Russell rn - No prospect on the Bulls for that matter has much value, though all 'should' be good. Don't get that team."
ESPN is always useful to test.

"I was answering the question ""How often do prospects with poor athleticism pan out"", not ""who is Killian Hayes like"""
"Harden creates for others because of the enormous gravity his scoring creates. Killian Hayes is probably never gonna be that kind of player. I do like some of the court vision i've seen from him, but until his handles and jump shot improve, it's not going to translate into winning basketball. That said, look at the jump that Garland took this year after a rookie campaign plagued by similar issues, so there's hope."
found killian hayes' reddit account
"I mean idk how you can trash either of those, both of them he clearly went with national consensus at the time and even rated guy like SGA above what a lot of the media did and said in the lead up to 2018 that Luka would be the best player.  The reason his Killian Hayes love is so weird is that all of the highlights I‚Äôve seen of him never led me to believe that he‚Äôd be the best player in this draft and I‚Äôm sure a lot of people feel that way."
"He also says that he doesn‚Äôt have the skills yet in that report, just that the tools are there. Killian shot like ass from 3 in Europe scouts just think the shot looks good and is projectable. He can‚Äôt use his right hand at all right now. Direct quote from the article:  Skills are improvable with time and work, but they aren‚Äôt there yet for Hayes.  Hayes has tools and flashes, he‚Äôs not close to NBA ready"
"&gt; Most NBA players, let alone teenagers, don‚Äôt possess the type of footwork required to attempt such complex moves, but Hayes is ahead of the curve.  ...  &gt; Why not take Hayes, the prospect with the strongest foundation for success  ...  &gt; One prospect, though, checks more boxes than all of the others. Who can shoot? Who can generate space off the dribble? Who has a feel for the game? Who makes his teammates better? Who can defend? Who conjures memories of All-Stars? It‚Äôs the best prospect in the 2020 NBA draft: Killian Hayes.  Where are you reading: this guy‚Äôs a real project in comparison to other prospects?"
"https://www.theringer.com/2020/4/15/21220970/nba-draft-killian-hayes-2020-top-prospect  This whole scouting report is essentially saying that KOC thinks hayes has the highest ceiling in the draft, but he‚Äôs just toolsy right now and still needs a lot of development. KOC was by far the highest on Hayes as a prospect and even he thinks it‚Äôs going to take time"
Kevin O‚ÄôConnor driving around downtown Detroit begging through texts for Killian Hayes to make a jump shot
"Trae put up 35-11 on 13-23 shooting in his third career game.  He scored in double digits 13 consecutive games to open his career.  Grading out as a negative overall due to bad defense or bad shot selection or TO issues isn't that big of a deal for a young PG, but being unable to score at all is a pretty big concern for a young PG.    If the expectation for Hayes is that he becomes a starting caliber PG, he should improve pretty quickly.  Most bad rookie PGs don't end up being starting caliber players, the onus is on Killian to prove that he is better than he currently looks."
"He was definitely trying to be the smartest guy in the room with his Killian Hayes takes. He really just doesn‚Äôt seem very good. A bad draft selection in isolation, and a reckless one with someone like haliburton on the board still."
"Not looking for ‚Äúsignificant confidence‚Äù on almost anything for these rookies. I‚Äôm firmly in the camp that thinks these rookies are screwed this year. If I can get 50 consecutive attempts that go good, then I‚Äôm not giving up on a guy. Killian Hayes looks out of sorts, but I‚Äôm not writing him off this year. Give the Pistons a real off-season and let him get used to NBA speed a little before we say he‚Äôs trash. I‚Äôm not seeing Anthony Bennett from him yet. I also don‚Äôt believe the Deni Avdija is going to be good yet either. Even the veterans might be off these first few weeks.  If he still looks good in week 5 and 6, then let‚Äôs talk about him being a serious asset."
"I don‚Äôt recall people ever alluding to him being more ready   Kevin O‚ÄôConnor was hot as anything on Killian Hayes and here was his take   &gt; Dynamic left-handed shot maker who‚Äôs made rapid progress at age 18, though he‚Äôs raw in some technical areas.  Just because he played pro ball doesn‚Äôt mean he was more ready."

I still remember his Lauri grade https://mobile.twitter.com/ringer/status/878047033080168448  I love how passionate KOC is though. Waiting to see if he's right about Killian Hayes.
"Haha not sure about that anymore. On the latest Mismatch pod he seemed to be admitting he might have been wrong and they had a good laugh about Killian Hayes although he did say he hasn't completely given up hope yet (which is fair, it's only early in the season)"
Damn I really thought Killian Hayes was going to be goods and end up being a steal. Turned out there's a reason I'm not an NBA scout I guess
Killian Hayes triple double coming
Killian Hayes needs to fix his dribbling.
I thought Killian Hayes was out for the entire season? Must have been mistaken
"As a point guard? No you don't. Steve Nash never averaged over 20, even in his mvp seasons (15.5 &amp; 18.8) and didn't even average over 10 until his fifth season (3.3 pts per game his rookie year!!). Chris Paul has never averaged over 20. Lowry didn't average over 10 until his 7th season. Kidd basically never went over 15 ppg except for one time in 2003.  The PG stat is assists first and foremost. Defense stats (deflections, shots challenged, steals) are probably next. But there is variety amongst pgs - in the modern era a few high scoring PGs have come into the limelight (curry, lillard) alongside triple double guys (westbrook, doncic). But neither of those archetypes are necessary for greatness: Nash never averaged over 5 boards or even over 1 steal his whole career, all he stuffed the sheet with was assists. Killian Hayes isn't the next Nash but my point is being a good point guard has very little to do with PPG"
Killian Hayes looked great tonight. So happy for him.
"Reminder the Killian ""Bust"" Hayes had the highest +/- in the game. Granted it was against the garbage ass kings, but beggars can't be choosers"
A couple years ago Theo Maledon and Killian Hayes were rated about the same. Somehow Hayes pulled way ahead and became a top ten pick and Maledon fell to the second round. But somehow Maledon seems way better than Hayes.
"Do you want to know who are the guys which are even below Deni in this  VORP rank?  I will give you several names: Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, Isaac Okoro  Patrick Williams, Killian Hayes aren't much higher than Avdija.  Basically all top-10 selected rookies playing big enough minutes per game except Lamelo...  Yes... send them all to G-League"
"Wow, all because KOC put Killian Hayes 1 on his draft board /s"
"KOC said Killian Hayes was gonna be better than Lamelo and Antman, why does anyone listen to this guy?"
"Theo is 6th.   Poku, Patrick Williams, LaMelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, Killian Hayes, then Theo"
"You aren‚Äôt familiar with the elite tier spacing that Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Josh Jackson, Delon Wright, Killian Hayes, and Jahlil Okafor were providing Blake early this season so that nobody was clogging the lane defensively?"
Steph Curry is the best player in the league and has a top 5 peak.   Dirk was the best player in the league from 06-08.   Killian Hayes will be a top two player from this rookie class.
KOC saying Wolves should draft Wiseman   And KOC having Killian Hayes No. 1 on his big board
"I agree with you to an extent but I also think it depends. Like Point guards have the steepest learning curve but Center's still have to call out coverages and learn defense and stuff. I think the rankings of positional NBA transition difficulty go    1. Point guards and Primary creators (Killian Hayes, Leandro Bolmaro)   2. Centers and defensive bigs (Wiseman, Mobley, Isaiah Jackson)   3. Off the bounce scorers (Cam Thomas, Tyler Herro)   4. Plug n' play wings ( Devin Vassell, Moses Moody)"
"**Killian Hayes** - started off slow, has looked like he has a much better pulse on our offensive movement since returning two games ago but still isn't scoring much. Really wish his success hadn't been tied to everyone's opinion of Kevin O'Connor because he's an extremely talented rookie who's been fine for what he was advertised, but because he isn't running away with RotY he's already been labeled a bust by some  **Isaiah Stewart** - was a fan favorite from day 1 for his hustle, but now his skill is starting to shine through and it's really exciting. He has shot 42% from deep (on limited attempts) and is above 50% from 10-16ft. His defensive hustle is insane (I believe he's leading rookies in Blocks per game) and he's a great offensive rebounder. He'll be fun to watch for a long time.  **Saddiq Bey** - came in as an NBA ready shooter (as advertised) but has shown a bit more ability than even that. He's put together a few moves with his back to the basket, can create his own 3 in a way that looks suspiciously identical to Wayne Ellington, and has put the ball on the floor as well. If he becomes a playmaker as well as a shooter, he should be a future all star.  **Saben Lee** - Isn't a revelation or anything but he looks like he'll last in the league which is pretty cool for a 2nd rounder. You can tell he's not comfortable with his shot but his ability to get to the rim and get fouled (or make the extra pass) has allowed him to stay on the floor. He also came very close to posterizing Vucevic so that was fun.  .  All in all, a pretty solid but VERY productive draft for Weaver's first year as GM. The future is exciting in Detroit."
"Hayes was #1 on Kevin O'Connor's *personal* board.   KOC was kind of alone on Killian Hayes Island though, Bill Simmons and some of the others were fairly skeptical and definitely didn't have him #1."

TIL Killian Hayes is back on the court
"Number one pick material  Jokes aside, I love me some Killian Hayes, glad to see him picking it up"
If Killian Hayes had Parker's speed he'd be on a totally different tier as a prospect
I bet there‚Äôs at least one other person named Killian Hayes in the world
"The difference is actually Pop. without Pop, Tony Parker is just another Killian Hayes"
Man can't he be the first Killian Hayes
Is Elf really worse than Killian Hayes or whoever the Magic have as a starter right now?
"If you know me then you know I‚Äôm blunt and tell it like I see it. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of flack for calling objectively negative players and processes for what they are.   I legitimately think you have something going. You are on a path that you should have taken years ago, but at least you‚Äôre here. Never should have traded for Blake. Should have done this years before that. That‚Äôs how late you are.   BUT. While I do think Killian Hayes is a dubious prospect, I really like Lee, Stewart and particularly Saddiq. You‚Äôre doing the right things taking chances on cast outs. Enjoy these years. Make takes on who will pan out and who won‚Äôt. You‚Äôre a storied franchise and in five years you‚Äôll be back in contention."
I'm not a Pistons fan but always root for the Pistons. I've probably watched more Pistons games this year than most people who aren't Pistons fans. I think the future looks bright. At PG rookie Killian Hayes is a question mark but a good PG is not hard to find in this league. At SG Hamidou Diallo seems like an exciting athletic player who is a good defender and explosive scorer. At SF rookie Saddiq Bey seems like a solid defender and very good 3pt shooter. At PF Jerami Grant has been playing great and looks like one of the most improved players in the NBA this year. At C rookie Isaiah Stewart provides a strong defensive presence and has a good ability to score down low
"I think Killian Hayes is a major question mark and I personally am not a believer.   However, I‚Äôm loving Stewart and Saddiq. Love Lee as well. Grant has predictably slowed down from his hot start but he‚Äôs still a great player and a good role on the team.   You could have a worse coach to lead the rebuild and the FO finally did what‚Äôs necessary.   So while I think you should have done this years ago, at least you‚Äôre on the right track now."
I was talking about Jaxson Hayes. Killian is horrible
Lmao I was talking about Jaxson Hayes idk anything about Killian
"Some of these guys were literally in Europe last year (Poku, Killian Hayes, Maldeon). They didn't dominate and didn't even play at the top level. Hayes team played in Eurocup, which is like the second tier tournament for people who don't make Euroleague...and he got spanked. Poku was literally playing in high school gyms in the minor leagues last year. You don't know of what you are talking about.  Real Madrid beat OKC in a scrimmage just a few years ago, when OKC had MVP Russ, being guarded by 16 year old Luka."
"No, I live your head rent free. I have a reason to watch Killian Hayes, you don't have any reason at all to care about what I do on reddit."
"Trae young is 6‚Äô1 and ‚Äú180‚Äù and Killian hayes is 6‚Äô5 195 pounds.  Listed on nba.com. Why you lying. Plus all I did was look up Killian and see 6‚Äô5 195 and was like nope not undersized. This isn‚Äôt a debate. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô5 195 point guard and will get stronger. I‚Äôm look at the sky and saying it‚Äôs blue and you‚Äôre saying no it‚Äôs not. This is black and white. He‚Äôs not undersized, that was all I was saying. Just go post everywhere that he can‚Äôt shoot."
"It wasn‚Äôt just KOC though, a decent amount of people were pretty high on Hayes.  It‚Äôs kinda weird how athleticism translates. That was Luka‚Äôs main knock coming into the NBA &amp; scouts weren‚Äôt wrong, he‚Äôs really not particularly athletic compared to most players, but even when he‚Äôs out of shape it barely matters to his game. Somehow still gets wherever he wants.  Killian was a pretty efficient guard (60%+ TS with a good FT%) who had great passing vision &amp; good defensive instincts but his lack of athleticism has completely impeded him from doing what he wants at the NBA level.   Drafting is hard."
"The Pistons were at the top of the NBA - six straight trips to the ECF, back to back Finals appearance and one quarter away from repeating as champions in 2005 against the Spurs  After that the owner died, his wife took over, Dumars ran the team into the ground, did not rebuild properly, gave away big contracts to terrible players, drafted decently but due to the coaching carousel never developed these players and watched as players like Middleton, Dinwiddie, and others thrived once they left.  Then Davidson's wife sold the team to Tom Gores, a coke addict billionaire who despite much success in other areas of life - can not run a basketball team.  The coaching carousel continued with Ron Jeremy aka Jeff's lil bro aka Stan Van Build a fucking a Wall being hired as a Coach/GM combo. He proceeded to put the keys of the franchise in the hands of one of the best point guards of probably the last thirty years, Reggie Jackson. Then on the eve of being fired, and supposedly at the behest of said coke addict, SVG mortgaged the entire future (or whatever was left of it) in order to get Blake Griffin.  Once Blake Griffin recovered from the shock of his premature jersey retirement and traded to the D, he actually put together a really great string of games. The Pistons had a chance to do right by him and trade him to a team and get big assets, possibly more than what they traded away. But instead they chose to keep him, he got injured (again), and was just bought out.  Now we have hired Weaver, a new GM from Presti's tree in OKC, who so far has been swindled on various trades, drafted big men only to pay Plumlee 8M to start, let Christian Wood walk for nothing (when it was all but confirmed he wanted to stay in Detroit), drafted Killian Hayes (a reach).  On the bright side, we bought out Blake Griffin, the only player besides Sekou (who you really cant call an NBA player maybe G league) left over from last year.  Something to keep in mind, since 1980 the Pistons have drafted in the top 5 only THREE times - 1981 - Isiah Thomas, 1994 - Grant Hill, 2003 - Darko Milicic.  In the past 40 years, the Pistons have drafted in the top 5 - 3 times.  Not bad enough to be in the top of the draft, but not good enough to actually make some noise.  In that 40 year period only 10 franchises won a championship - Celtics, Lakers, Bulls, Sixers, Spurs, Heat, Mavericks, Cavs, Warriors, Raptors.  I know it's a grim outlook but we did have the Bad Boys Pistons two chips and the Going to Work Pistons that forced the league to change the rules and brought home a chip in 2004. And despite the hard times im still proud to be a Pistons fan and will be till the end! GO PISTONS!"
Remember when a post here in r/nba said Lamelo is a poor man‚Äôs Killian Hayes?
Probably the same people that call Killian Hayes a bust after 7 games.
"Theo Maledon makes his best game against Chris Paul.  Quite a symbol for him.  At the time of the draft, everyone seemed to think that Killian Hayes would have a better impact in the NBA than Theo Maledon.  Here in France, many observers thought the opposite.  It's only their first year, but I think Theo has everything to make a better career."
"Killian Hayes only played 7 games before injury, so the jury is still out on him."
Yeah that was one of the guys I was thinking of   Can call him Machiavellian Killian Hayes whenever he has a bad game
"Pistons with Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Saben Lee, Killian Hayes, and one of Jalen Green/Jalen Suggs/Evan Mobley is a budding dynasty"
"hard to decide between Killian Hayes, Okongwu and Deni, they all have legit cases for the number one spot  ...of Kevin O'Connor's heart"
"I mean except they will have a top 5 pick which will add another 7-9 mil into their cap. And that pick will probably be Cade, Suggs or Green (3/4 change they wouldn't draft Kuminga because they have bey and grant). They already have Killian Hayes as another backcourt piece. Why would they sign GTJ to block their 2 lottery picks from coming through"
"I see everyone is sleeping on the Pistons.  Troy Weaver is assembling a gritty, hard-nosed team of Detroit-style youngsters who will all break out at the same time.  Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee, Hamadou Diallo, Sekou Doumboya, Jerami Grant, and a likely top 3 pick who could be Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, or Mobley."
That must be a French thing. Killian Hayes also had a 60 min streak earlier this year.
And 19-year old Killian Hayes is the second longest tenured Piston.
I think he's debating whether to have Jerami Grant or Killian Hayes for dinner
"KOC is right about Melo being good, but I find it funny he‚Äôs pushing it so hard now when he was gargling Killian Hayes for being able drive left."
He would take Lamelo over Killian Hayes??
What about Killian Hayes tho? üòÇüòÇ
Killian hayes for sure
"Our entire last draft has looked incredible so far. Haven‚Äôt seen enough of Killian Hayes yet but Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, and Saben Lee have been fantastic all year and will hopefully be key pieces as we go along. Josh Jackson and Mason Plumlee have been great too but I‚Äôm not sure how they factor into the future. Hopefully we can get one of the top guys in the draft like Cade, Suggs, or Green who can make a huge impact immediately. I trust Weaver in FA and the draft and we‚Äôve played a lot better than our record so I‚Äôm optimistic for the first time in a long time."
"He was also instrumental in making OKC what it was in the early 2010s. And while Killian Hayes doesn‚Äôt look great Weaver drafted Bey, Stewart, and Saban Lee, all of which look like steals from the draft. I agree Weaver didn‚Äôt really need to go for the T-Wolves throat, but you don‚Äôt need to be so salty lmao."
Killian Hayes is indeed ass. He's absolute shit and would be okay with him becoming just decent.
"Pistons FO has been killing it for the last two years.  And don't even start with, ""But Killian Hayes."" That sample size is small as fuck and it's not like he's Emmanuel Mudiay, he's shown flashes of really good ball."
PG: Killian Hayes   SG: whoever the Lakers start at SG this year   SF: Gary Harris  PF: Darius Bazley  C: Khrm Birch
Killian Hayes üî•üî•
He also thinks killian hayes is going to be the best player in his draft lol
Killian Hayes
Killian Hayes is rated 71 in 2k22. Legit thought he wasn‚Äôt in the game until I scrolled down
"Killian Hayes is the next James Harden, debate with yo momma üò¥üòÆ‚Äçüí®üí®"
"Killian Hayes, Frank Ntilikina, Theo Maledon are all heirs to the throne of Tony Parker  Cest nul"
"Probably a package surrounding Killian Hayes, salary fillers, and picks"
"OP with 4 absolutely terrible posts now in 2 days  &gt;Can Killian Hayes be useful?  ...he's 20  &gt;Eric Bledsoe is still really good  Enough said  &gt;Will Sekou Doumbouya be waived by the end of the season?&gt;He made no progress from year 1 to 2 and still remained one of the worst players in the league, is it over for him?  Is it over for a 20 year old?    &gt;How many people actually call Ron Artest ""Metta World Peace""? &gt;I don't see anybody actually calling him that, I always went with Ron Artest, it's well established and rolls off the tongue well.    The reason that is a stupid post is Ron Artest's name is Ron Sandiford-Artest and he hasn't been Metta in years"
Killian Hayes
Is Killian a popular name in France? Just realized he and Killian Hayes are both French and the only Killians in the NBA. Same with Kylian Mbapp√© for that matter.
Killian Hayes &gt; D‚ÄôAngelo Russell &gt; James Harden
Killian Hayes Evan Fournier Manu Ginobili
KiLlIaN hAyEs
"Those basketball nerds would drive so many people away with their negative charisma and stage presence   Like if you thought Rachael was unappealing, expect KOC to do even worse than that   Nobody wants to hear blog boy tell you why a players 50 point night isn‚Äôt as impactful as killian hayes dropping 12-10"
Jerami Grant  Cade Cunningham  Saddiq Bey  Isaiah Stewart  Killian Hayes
"Demarre Carolle or Killian Hayes, not sure."
Cade Cunningham  Isiah Stewart  Killian Hayes Saddiq bey  Jerami grant
That made me laugh but Kwame hanging with shaq is a better bet that Killian Hayes hanging with Steph so‚Ä¶.
Maybe the Mavs can trade for Killian Hayes while he‚Äôs still undervalued
Killian Hayes
Killian Hayes
Killian Hayes is headed down this same path. He'll be out of the league if he can't figure out how to not shoot like ass.
Killian Hayes.
People forgetting Killian Hayes exists smh
"if the pistons traded our young core and/or assets for another +30 year old star, im killing myself. the ebst we have is jerami grant, killian hayes, Isaiah stewart, saddiq bey, and first round picks. both sides say no probably"

Inject every killian hayes assist right into my veins
"Film really helps. Killian Hayes for example had a dreadful start to the season. Then he got injured and sat out for 3 months, and during his absence he was able to watch his teammates, watch a lot of film, and learn more about the game so that when he came back the whole game slowed down considerably for him, and he was so much better post-injury."
Scooping that Killian Hayes Stock while nobody notices.  OKC stock is a no brainer. Leap calls all day
I‚Äôm pretty sure if LA was cold we‚Äôd still win more than 20 games lmao have fun with Killian ‚Äúcan literally only play basketball with his left hand‚Äù Hayes
Tough scene for Machiavelian Killian Hayes this week
**Pistons** (no order)  Killian Hayes  Saddiq Bey  Jerami Grant  Beef Stew  Sekou Doumbouya
"Yes. People think he's a top 5 pg in history, top 20 ever, and best shooter, but he's just some scrub that can't make it to the 8th seed.  Luckily we got Killian Hayes instead of that scrub"
I know we‚Äôre used to the Pistons having a super team... but not winning the lottery with Beef Stew AND Saddiq Bey (along with a really solid Killian Hayes as your #3) should be viewed as a failure of an off-season
"u convinced me right now, give me Haliburton for Killian Hayes, i wanted tyrese draft night anyways lmfao  Edit: sweet i glossed over the ending of three where you are already looking for hayes! I was looking for a Haliburton u genius"
"He wasn't good with Detroit? How about Detroit wasn't good with him? Especially with the way the coach told him he has just as good as a shot there then New York. With that attitude no wonder the pistons are doing horrible. Coach needs to pick that team up. Easily was the best PG dare I say player for Detroit in his short time there especially when you look at the PG depth for Detroit and they just have Killian Hayes, Cory Joseph, saben lee and Frank jackson  . Rose has been putting up numbers all besides the Cavs season. But I will agree he's been playing phenomenal with the Knicks. But I'll end this on a note that if you haven't been following rose since the bulls traded him to New York originally then you've been vastly missing out on the Renaissance of a man coming back to form when all seemed to give up on him."
"Haliburton has always been a bit of a high floor, low ceiling kind of player due to his physical attributes (average height, solid but unspectacular athleticism and skinny frame), age (he‚Äôs a year and a half older than guys like LaMelo, Ant, Patrick Williams, etc.), and lack of elite initiator skills. And teams at the top of the lottery are often hunting more for potential than current ability. The expectation was always that he‚Äôd be better out of the gate than a guy like Patrick Williams or Killian Hayes. The question was whether that would hold in 4 years."
Killian Hayes wouldn't even crack the first round in a redraft.  Kid looks lost and scared out there.  He's not a NBA-level player in any way.
"I still have confidence in Killian Hayes, but I think PGs take time to develop. I think they are finally on an upward trajectory, and that fans shouldn't be discouraged if it takes 2 years for more wins to happen.    I would like to see this gunslinger sell high on a couple assets tho"
"I feel like there's a good chance if you asked Stephen A or Max who Killian Hayes was, they couldn't tell you."
"&gt; Killian Hayes floor would still be an average starter with his good playmaking skill and defense  That's not his floor. That can't be his floor. He's the worst scorer in the league. He can't create his own shot, he can't shoot, and he can't get to the line. Without that, his passing is worthless and it shows with his TOs. And it's not a coachable thing, he's un-athletic and can't drive with his right. That isn't an overnight fix or a guaranteed fix. His floor is out-of-the-league/journeyman backup."
Killian Hayes floor would still be an average starter with his good playmaking skill and defense.. similar mold as Ricky Rubio or Lonzo Ball  His offense is leaving a lot to be desired tho. He never looks to score and his lay up drive game is bad despite him having some floater touch and good handle to get to where he wants.. he should be  able to figure it out
You‚Äôre exaggerating heavily if you think Jerami Grant proved himself as a number one option. It‚Äôs not super clear that Killian Hayes will be a big-time contributor either.
"Just this Year? Obi Toppin. I expected so much from him. But he's only played 11mpg, so cant really criticize when your coach dont play ya.  Cant really criticize Jalen Smith for the same reason, he wasnt given minutes behind a very very very deep bench.  But the award goes to the rookie that actually got minutes and disappointment goes to Killian Hayes and Deni Avdija"
A better version of this list  1 Timberwolves select Anthony Edwards  2 Warriors select Lamelo Ball  3 Hornets select Tyrese Haliburton  4 Bulls select Patrick Williams  5 Cavs select Isaac Okoro  6 Hawks select Killian Hayes  7 Pistons select Devin Vassell  8 Knicks select James Wiseman  9 Wizards select Onyeka Okongwu (honestly Wiseman and Okongwu could go either way)  10 Suns select Deni Avdija  11 Spurs select Aaron Nesmith  12 Kings select Kira Lewis Jr  13 Pelicans select Obi Toppin  14 Celtics select Jalen Smith
"Yo add killian Hayes and Isaiah Stewart  to that pistons team, killian arguably has the most upside on the team and Stewart played really well this season"
"Unfortunately, Griffin is having an atrocious season.  The people in the league who are having a season like his are Bazley, Killian Hayes, Avery Bradley, Jalen Suggs, Porter Jr., and Jalen Green.  I mean, Theis lost his job with the Rockets who don't seem to be trying to win much and he's probably been slightly better than Griffin.  Despite winning, the Nets might have even been better without Griffin's minutes."
however long Killian Hayes has been playing
"they both ass bro that‚Äôs the point, Saben at least brings energy. Killian Hayes is just doing cardio. How do you average a triple single starting on a tanking team. 6 points? cmon bro is terrible."
Killian Hayes might not start for Montana at this rate

Killian Hayes &gt; both
"Killian Hayes, Cory Joseph"
Killian hayes
I may get some hate with this from other Pistons fans but it‚Äôs probably been Killian Hayes.
Why you burning Suggs tho? He's a rookie guard. Rookie guards tend to struggle more in nba. Like at least trust on your talent.     But yeah Killian Hayes. I love Pistons and I just don't get why they picked that guy up in the first place.
"Killian Hayes oof...  I just looked up his stats on bballref.  started 14 games avg 25 minutes.  5.4 points 3.5 rebounds 3.5 assists  31/39/90 and a 42% TS.  ooof... I had to read that twice **31% fg** and **42% TS**,  Not sure i've seen such lower figures this season.  now I'm scared to looked up the other names listed."
Killian Hayes
"Mo Bamba and ""Someone on the Kings"" aren't in contention at all lol.  Killian Hayes looks awful. My vote is Killian Hayes."
"Well with Poeltl out for the Spurs they‚Äôve been starting Drew Eubanks who is awful. I‚Äôd go him, Bazley, or Killian Hayes"
Because you wasted a high pick on Killian Hayes.
Killian motherfuckin Hayes is our best 3 point shooter
Killian Hayes is easily number two behind Cade Cunningham and no one can disagree
"Too bad the Kings didn‚Äôt listen to KOC they could‚Äôve had a stacked roster with Killian Hayes, Poku, Coby White and Jarrett Culver"
They‚Äôre being purposely oblivious your point is obvious.   Me personally it‚Äôs pretty early altho he‚Äôs in Killian Hayes territory at the moment lol
they need killian hayes
"Jesus man, he‚Äôs entering Killian Hayes territory"
"Obi Toppin, Deni Avdija, Isaac Okoro, Killian Hayes"
Why ain't Killian Hayes good bruh I fell for the KOC hype
"Killian Hayes, Sadiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Pistons have 3 unathletic guys in their starting lineup."
"He is, no doubt.  Livers will be ready to play soon, hopefully he outperforms and can shoot better than Killian 34% FG Hayes."
Yall treat KPJ like Pistons fans treat Killian Hayes it‚Äôs pretty funny ngl   We‚Äôre both rebuilding young teams! Let the young guards develop &amp; figure out their place smfh.
"It‚Äôs probably not smart to give up on Killian Hayes yet but he‚Äôs looking like a bust. Anyways, I wanna see point Cade with a great shooter as his backcourt partner"
I think these guys have all star potential:  Darius Garland  Patrick Williams  Wendell Carter Jr  Killian Hayes
&gt;Is he really any worse than Killian Hayes?  Yes. Plus Hayes has played only 40 games. He will grow a lot
"Is he really any worse than Killian Hayes?  Either way, playing either of these guys as a starter is hoping they can develop into players who can legitimately call themselves starters on a competitive team some day, and Hayes 34% career FG % makes him a significant part of the Pistons Offense woes. You can't shoot 34% in the NBA and be anything other than a 15th man. There is at least a partial answer in Frank Jackson, with 43% career shooting. Frank is only 23, he can still develop.   This isn't to say the Pistons don't need someone better than these two, but right now Frank Jackson &gt; Killian Hayes."
Frank Jackson.  Should let him start instead of Killian Hayes.  He shoots quite a bit better it seems like.
Killian Hayes is a lottery pick too‚Ä¶ and + jerami grant.
Cade Cunningham is pretty great but what happened to Killian Hayes? I thought he was a solid player? Or is he like Markelle Fultz?
Duh. Killian Hayes sucks
"cade gonna go off tomorrow, i assume  or killian hayes, i dunno"
We drafted Killian fucking Hayes. You think we‚Äôre just going to magically start learning how to draft and trade?  The good days are behind us.
"The current starting lineup:  Cade Cunningham   Killian Hayes (or Diallo/Jackson for some)  Saddiq Bey  Jerami Grant  Isaiah Stewart  It‚Äôs just they can‚Äôt hit a thing so far this year, and Casey is up to his usual fuckery"
"Like they did with Killian ""Zero Points"" Hayes?"
"lol you‚Äôre the type of weirdo to post ‚ÄúCade has 0 free throws after 2 Summer League games‚Äù, ‚ÄúCade has the lowest points of a first pick since Anthony Bennett‚Äù, ‚ÄúKillian Hayes 2 points‚Äù"
I tuned in since I picked Killian Hayes in my fantasy team due to KOC hype. Looking like a bad pick so far.
KOC is an absolute nut for his killian hayes campaign
"Ah got it, the Killian Hayes special (although he‚Äôs a good passer &amp; shooter)"
"&gt;Dwane Casey said it was big for Killian Hayes to come back from reinjuring his thumb and Cade Cunningham playing through the ankle issues: ""You have to play through something to be successful in this league.""  he's right, but oof thats a tricky subject. you really, really have to know your body well as an athlete, because MRIs dont always tell the whole story. some things are ok to play through, some arent."
I feel like Rockets could really use Killian Hayes
"Hayes has been much more comfortable with a secondary ball handler. Him and Cade are a great backcourt core, and now Killian is shooting 38% from 3 which is decent enough."
"This was a breakout game for Killian Hayes. It‚Äôs only his 37th career game, and he has been better and better since Cade came back from injury. I think his role is coming in to shape and he has less pressure with Cade in the spotlight."
"That was a really well played game by Killian Hayes.   Casey really took his ""making bizarre coaching decisions in order to play Cory Joseph more minutes"" level to another dimension today when he had Cade, Killian, and Cory all on the court at the same time."
"FINALLY A GOOD GAME BY KILLIAN HAYES.  Amazing playmaking and defence, along with hitting some 3's"
"I like Killian Hayes he‚Äôs a good player, but I‚Äôd like to see Cade used as more than a spot up shooter 80% of the game"
Killian hayes is lockdown. Like elite
I‚Äôm not a Killian hayes stan by any means but a lot of people who say this just aren‚Äôt watching. He obviously can‚Äôt score at all but he plays great defense and the offense flows when he‚Äôs on the floor. Not saying he‚Äôs a starting level PG or anything but he absolutely is an NBA player. Better than Cory Joseph at this point
Dog even Killian Hayes would be a better fit than Westbrook
Killian Hayes doesn‚Äôt have long left in the league.

Killian Hayes is really bad lol
I find myself checking Detroit box scores probably more than most and I don't think I've ever seen Killian Hayes shoot above 50% in a game. It's always somewhere between 2/7 - 2/9
Killian Hayes stays taking Ls
Killian Hayes is shooting 29.6% from the field this season. So if you are defending him there is a 70.4% chance he will miss - pretty solid
"Dude was an absolute steal for Philly. I‚Äôll give you Killian Hayes, the 7th overall pick for him."
I think that honour has to go to Killian Hayes
killian hayes üò∂üò∂üò∂ you can‚Äôt have a pg playing that many minutes that does those 4/3/4 ass numbers consistently
Killian Hayes
so he choose the Killian Hayes path
"Oh sweet a Pistons post. I'll also add Cory Joseph pounding the ball into the floor for 18 seconds, and Killian Hayes."
"Now you listen here, Killian Hayes is shooting 38% from three"
Idk the top ten but I'd like to point out that Killian Hayes is a good perimeter defender. I feel like people don't know that about him.   That is all.
Jeez when Killian Hayes is your only above average guy you know it's fucking bad
"You forgot Killian Hayes, who mercifully was not playing tonight. He clogs up the spacing because he can‚Äôt shoot and he takes ball handling possessions away from Cade"
Nobody ever criticizes Killian Hayes because they skip straight to roasting Kevin O'Connor lol
Just like how no one can criticize Killian Hayes because of his eyebrows
"these tweets were a minute apart lmao  https://twitter.com/JLEdwardsIII/status/1456747652398321666  &gt; Young fan was holding a sign by the court that said ‚Äúrock, paper, scissors and if I win I get about it shoes.‚Äù Killian Hayes, coming out for warmups, stopped and played. He lost. Shoes incoming.  https://twitter.com/JLEdwardsIII/status/1456747799031263232  &gt; Killian Hayes is OUT tonight with a thumb injury."
did Killian Hayes hurt his thumb playing rock paper scissors with a kid in the arena?
Killian Hayes isn‚Äôt 6‚Äô5‚Äù - I‚Äôm 187cm (6‚Äô1‚Äù) and he maybe had two inches on me. I also had on flip flops while he was wearing his basketball shoes.
"Yeah if I'm a Detroit fan, this season is a complete wash from the get go, so Cade just needs to ride out his first season as smoothly as possible.  Even Killian Hayes is rusty af, I think he had his first decent NBA game ever today? I dunno lol."
Killian Hayes is probably shorter than listed too
I‚Äôm not a looker and I mean no disrespect but Killian Hayes kinda ugly af lmao
He's visibly taller than Killian Hayes who is listed at 6'5
She might be better than Killian Hayes
Where‚Äôs Killian Hayes at ? It‚Äôs absurd to me that this guy is the ‚Äúdraft expert‚Äù for any website
i knew it. killian hayes fmvp
I‚Äôm more disturbed by how Killian Hayes looks. He looks completely lost out there and his shot looks broken. I see him getting ripped and blocked and dribbling the ball off his foot left and right
"Killian Hayes, hes basically Marcus Smart but french"
"Killian Hayes looked lost for the first half of last year too, turns out he was shit.  I'd be stressing just a little bit as a Pistons fan."

Tbh you‚Äôre probably right.  Kpj was a better story when he was our bright spot but he looks like a bit of an obstacle for other young players now.   Almost like Killian hayes does for Cade
"I remember snapchatting Bennett lowlights to my cavs fan friend expecting him to talk some shit and fire back with something but he was just bummed and sad about how much Bennett stunk. Made me feel bad after 5 or 6 times doing it so I stopped.   That being said, Bennett was a guy in way over his head getting drafted where he shouldn't have been drafted but I think Cade is gonna be just fine. This feels like normal rookie struggles to me. Killian Hayes on the other hand is starting to get a bit concerning though he's basically still a rookie since he was injured a bunch."
Hayes looks like he can shoot catch and shoot 3s better than he can pull ups just have cade run point and keep Killian at the 2
Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have him stand in the corner the whole game and actually run the offense through him instead of Corey Joseph and Killian Hayes
shout out to you for actually watching the game. are you saying letting Cory Joseph and Killian Hayes initiate offense while Cade sits in the corner like Kyle Korver isn‚Äôt a good idea?
Based on reading this comment section I‚Äôve deduced that Killian Hayes is a Detroitian Darius Bazley. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss y‚Äôall üòî
Killian hayes sucks but his eye brows are so nice
Im sorry but Killian Hayes fucking sucks.
keeping killian hayes is going put a damper on cade's development 100%
Killian Hayes sucks bad man
Killian Hayes sleeper candidate fr
Dunno if you're being sarcastic but the Pistons had two all-rookie selections in Bey and Stewart. Not to mention Killian Hayes getting hurt early. They have a nice squad and I wouldn't be surprised to see them make noise as soon as 2023.
"OKC has the best player in Shai, Dort is really good, and obviously a ton of picks.  However, I believe the Pistons have the better overall prospects and potential/fit as a team. Bey and Stewart already proved as rookies that they are very valuable players in the modern NBA. Killian Hayes still has a ton of potential. Obviously Cade coming in is a great prospect. He could be a superstar very soon. Even Sekou is still an unknown at still 20 years old. Then you throw in Saben Lee who surprised as a 2nd round point guard, and 3 second round picks this year (37, 42, 52) which could be packaged along with a player to move back into the first, this Pistons have quite a collection of solid young players. Plus Jerami Grant is the best of both teams veterans, and fits perfectly with the young core.   So basically at this time I'd say the Pistons will be better sooner. Now this can obviously change if Cade busts, the Pistons rookies from last year don't really improve at all, the Thunder hit on a few draft picks, package them for a legit star, or outright win the lottery, Poku actually becomes a good/great player, or if there are injuries, etc."
"I have a feeling Pistons will just roll the ball out and tell him to do whatever he wants, unless Killian Hayes makes a leap. Cade will be de facto point."
"Lamelo, Poku, Antman, Patrick Williams, and Killian Hayes were 1-yr olds when Bron got drafted"
"The last 10 drafts below. Out of 20 picks, only Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ and Julius Randle are on the level of Pascal and you could argue he is better than all of them. You are way more likely to get guys like Coby White and Romeo Langford than a Jamal Murray and Bam Adebayo.  7th picks: Killian Hayes, Coby White, Wendall Carter, Lauri Markannen, Jamal Murray, Emmanuel Mudiay, Julius Randle, Ben McLemore, Harrison Barnes, Bismack Biyombo  14th picks: Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, MPJ, Bam Adebayo, Denzel Valentine, Cameron Payne, TJ Warren, Shabazz Muhammad, John Henson, Marcus Morris"
"&gt; a further developed Killian  I actually think this is the key for you guys. Cunningham and Bey seem like sure things to me, if Hayes can find a way to contribute at all then they could be an elite young core."
"&gt;20 wins each season  This season the entire roster was gutted, there‚Äôs only 1 guy from last season still on the team. Judging a rebuild by its record in year 1 is a lousy take.   &gt;Grant seems like the same guy  Bro what is this? Grant developed super nice handles, a middy game, and an unstoppable driving game (top 20 in the league). He‚Äôs a completely different player.  Casey helped developed two guys out the lottery into all-rookies, and they‚Äôre completely different players now than they were when they were drafted. Killian Hayes looks so much better than he did at the start of the season. He helped Plumlee, Wright, CoJo, Diallo, Frank Jackson have career years. Yea the record ain‚Äôt great - but it was a developmental season lol. Casey did a good job, as he both developed the players and helped us fade for Cade successfully."
"Might be a bit early to call everyone from their last years draft as starting caliber.   These guys are still pretty young and we‚Äôre getting minutes on the worst team in the league. While they all have potential to be starters/good players, someone like Killian Hayes is currently not a starting caliber player."
Are we sure Killian Hayes is a starter in this league?
"Veteran players like killian Hayes, Kelvin johnson and Darius garland?"
Killian Hayes it is then
That Killian Hayes would be better than Haliburton. At least its still possible
"Ive got a rookie Killian Hayes Jersey that my grandmother got me (she doesn‚Äôt know anything about basketball)   Not sure why she settled on that player, but I very much cherish it."
"KOC on the draft &gt;&gt;&gt; KOC on the NBA, even with the Killian Hayes whoosh."
"Yeah I think expectations should be lower. Expecting Giannis/Kawhi or DMitchell/DBook level production out of the 10-15 range is unfair. Those are anomolies. I even think Jamal Murray at 7th pick is quite good.  We drafted Killian Hayes at No 7. While I think (and this is generous) he has skills that could turn him into an All-Star level player, I would be pretty happy if he could play alongside whoever we draft this year and run some good offense while our star is on the bench.  There are so many factors that shape a draft picks transition into the NBA, some of them are very much out of their control, so I think it is unfair to try and evaluate every lottery pick as if it could be a potential star."
Still not sold on Killian Hayes
I will lose all respect for Weaver if he picks Green over Cade.   People say Weaver's only made good draft picks but arguably Killian Hayes was a miss given that both Bey and Stewart are better than him (along with a few other players drafted after Hayes).
"Wiseman is younger now than Ayton was when we was drafted. Look at the list of players who have gone 7 overall in the last few years, Steph, Jamal Murray, Julias Randle, Killian Hayes, Harrison Barnes, Eric Gordon, Harrison Barnes  It actually has one of the highest hit rates of any draft pick"
"&gt; Dude had Killian Hayes as the number one overall pick on his draft board.  I don't ever really hold draft fails against people, happens all the time.   &gt;Prior to Bill Simmons giving him an undeserved and unearned position as head basketball writer at the Ringer, he was an unknown Celtics blogger. Nepotism is the only reason he's where he is.  Unfortunately this seems to be common in The Ringer and Sports journalism in general."
"KOC is not good at basketball by any measure. Dude had Killian Hayes as the number one overall pick on his draft board.  Prior to Bill Simmons giving him an undeserved and unearned position as head basketball writer at the Ringer, he was an unknown Celtics blogger. Nepotism is the only reason he's where he is."
Killian Hayes. His non injured play was great at the end of the season and he meshes well with Cade
"When I say they have the same playstyle im referring to the fact that theyre both big gaurds who can get to their spots,  score and also get the team involved. The thing I like the most about Cade is his defensive instincts combined with his 7 foot wingspan. Hes going to be different than Luka in his own way, especially on the defensive end. Im certain Luka will always be a better offensive player than Cade though. He may not be an elite defender like Kawhi, but if he can get up to the level of someone like Lu Dort or OG he could be a threat with everything hes still able to provide on the offensive end. Throw Killian Hayes in with him and you got a real pesty backcourt."
One trade I've knocked around for a while is Cleveland moving up to get Jalen Green - their pick and Colin Sexton.  If Detroit and Houston are high on Killian Hayes/KPJ respectively it makes sense; they have big playmakers who can compensate for Sexton's issues.
Zion Williamson - 28/10 on 62/30/72 shooting  DeAndre Hunter - 15/4 on 45/35/85  RJ Barrett - 18/6/4 on 45/37/77  Ja Morant - 21/4/8 on 43/32/74  Mikal Bridges - 13/5 on 50/40/85  Cam Reddish - 10/5 on 38/31/80  Kevin Porter Jr. - 18/3/7 on 41/30/76  Anthony Edwards - 22/4/4 on 43/35/80  LaMelo Ball - 16/7/8 on 44/37/78  James Wiseman - 14/9 on 55/33/70  Patrick Williams - 11/6 on 46/37/72  Onyeka Okongwu - 7/7 on 60/-/60  Tyrese Halliburton - 14/4/6 on 45/40/85  Killian Hayes - 11/3/6 on 37/34/80
Killian Hayes: 11 4 and 6 on 41/33/81 shooting splits
"There definitely was more than that. Stewart, Killian Hayes, Frank Jackson, Saben Lee, Hamidou Diallo, and Josh Jackson all showed reasons to be excited."
"Killian Hayes. No explanation, just curious to see what he can do lol. And he wasn't underwhelming but I think pat will is gonna be a hell of a player next year"
"This rebuild feels different in Detroit. Jerami Grant had a breakout season, 2 NBA all rookie guys drafted last year plus Killian Hayes, and now Cade Cunningham. Crazy things happen but I don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôre not a playoff team within a couple seasons."
Killian Hayes
Killian Hayes
Killian Hayes is a pretty cool NBA name
Yea but this man has zero athleticism . And u spend your 2020 1st round pick on a Facilitator in Killian Hayes just to turn around and draft another in 2021 ??? Makes zero sense team is one of the worst scoring teams in the NBA (bottom 5) and they just gonna let the best pure scorer go to the rockets ?? I‚Äôm baffled
C'mon man Cameron Payne would win over Killian Hayes
2022 - Jerami Grant    2023 - Killian Hayes  2024 - Cade Cunningham  2025 - Isiah Stewart    2026 - Mason Plumlee    2027 - Dwane Casey (player coach)
Killian Hayes
"I‚Äôm real high on Maxey and Tisse ofc but that‚Äôs about it. I sorta see Maxey as being a Kyle Lowry but better (dont know if that‚Äôs a lowball or not) and I don‚Äôt know Mattise‚Äôs ceiling until he gets a reliable shot of any kind.   Besides them we don‚Äôt really got anybody else. There *are* no stars on the roster aside from Jo, so we can‚Äôt trade Ben or Tobias for High picks. Top 15 for either of them would be generous and the only way id see it happening is if a real contender thought that one of them could put em over the hump and were in possession.  No disrespect to yur Cavs I just don‚Äôt see them having particularly *great* things ahead :(. Collin is awsome, garland is good, and Cedi is cool. Fro too. But none of them strike me as guys that can put you into the top eight. With Mo-town, Jerami Grant while not really ‚Äúyoung‚Äù is a player who‚Äôs proven he can keep himself within a deep playoff team rotation and Killian Hayes is too fresh to say anything about. Ln top of that they‚Äôll go number 1. Who knows what Cade‚Äôll be"
"Ha we dumped his ass to you guys and kick started our rebuild. Please don‚Äôt disrespect our first team all rookie as well as second team all rookie as well as killian Hayes who‚Äôs flashed some real potential after his injury.  There‚Äôs a video showing Cade being hyped up coming to Detroit, and someone in the background saying ‚Äúthank god it wasnt Cleveland‚Äù."
Why is grant and killian hayes there when bey is a better player than hayes? I think the real duo for us next year will be cade and grant
"As a Pistons fan I finally have players that I want to keep around lol. As many suggested before, I would probably move the number down to 6 simply because so many teams don‚Äôt have 8 great players to keep around.  (2020-2021 roster) 1. Killian Hayes 2. Isaiah Stewart  3. Saddiq Bey 4. Mason Plumlee  5. Jerami Grant 6. Hamidou Diallo 7.  Sekou Doumbouya 8. Saben Lee  Obviously 1-6 isn‚Äôt in really any order, but keeping the starters and all one of the better bench players we‚Äôd be fine. Sekou would probably be taken due to potential, but it‚Äôd also depend on who else is taken. I don‚Äôt believe Saben Lee would be taken due to being a solid rookie but not great enough to warrant being picked."
"What are you talking about? We have a center that just made all-rookie, and we only have 2 point guards: Killian Hayes and Saben Lee. Hardly guys you don‚Äôt draft Cade for. Fuck them picks I want the superstar prospect"
They already have Killian Hayes. They can have a lineup of Cade/Hayes/Bey/Grant/Stewart
"We eventually have to start thinking about drafting rookies, you know.  I‚Äôm probably gonna get downvoted to oblivion but this is quite inevitable, the Warriors are bout to pay the repeater tax and our owner Joe Lacob can‚Äôt be spending some infinite amount of luxury tax to sign or trade for veterans, especially those that make 8 figures for their salary. Steph, Klay, Dray and Wiggins combined to make about $140 million next year, which is more than all but 3 teams‚Äô entire payroll this year.   I mean, how many players are realistically difference makers that are worth the 7th and/or the 14th pick, especially at around $9 million which Killian Hayes at Aaron Nesmith, players drafted at #7 and #14 last year, combined to make?   Barring significant trades and injuries, #7 is as high as we‚Äôre going to picking in the next couple of years. And unless a really good role player is available for the right price, I just can‚Äôt see how trading for a vet helps them. And realistically the best chance at that kind of deal is with a Kelly Oubre sign-and-trade and even that is very unlikely.   TL;DR: It‚Äôs really hard to get good value out of trading these picks unless they‚Äôre packaged with Wiseman or Wiggins, given the rookie salaries of these draftees. And if they‚Äôre going to trade Wiseman and/or Wiggins, they‚Äôd have to get a lot. I mean, a lot."
TJ McConnell throws Killian Hayes into the crowd
"Yeah I think a lot of people saw 6,8 PG and looked a Luka as he was recently drafted. I can definitely see him shifting to a wing and potentially being a secondary ball handler next to Killian Hayes"
I can‚Äôt even clown KOC about the Killian Hayes take cuz I was high on Hayes coming out too lol. Still think he‚Äôll get it going in year 2
"I agree. I think Cade will be amazing and he absolutely seems like a great kid with a good head on his shoulders, but I think he's best off as a point forward, secondary playmaker type. Let a quicker guy be the one to first engage the defense, and then let Cade read the rotations and finish the play. I don't think he's best off as the primary playmaker, heliocentric, Luka/LeBron/Harden type of offense.  Maybe Killian Hayes can pair with Cade so there's a one-two punch of playmaking. Part of why a lot of people thought Cade's fit with SGA would have been beautiful, because they're both huge, unselfish, and patient playmakers; they would have both had defenses on a string together."
"Chill dude, I still think Bey and Stewart project as role players / starters rather than all stars, and killian hayes who knows at this point. They have a nice start but they‚Äôll need a lot more than just Cade"
Love the writeup. I‚Äôm not as high on Killian Hayes personally but got to like the foundation overall in Detroit.
"Leave it to the Ringer to still ride on the Killian Hayes' train. Can't the dude not drive to the left or something?  That all being said, it would've looked even more nice for Detroit if they went with Haliburton instead."
"Nah I completely disagree. Hayes can shoot. He shot 40% from 3 last season and has steadily improved his shot this season, going from like 20% in his first month to 33% in his last month. It ain‚Äôt great but his form is pretty and I have no doubt in my mind he‚Äôll be a great player. Very few players can pass like he can, and he‚Äôs only 19. This isn‚Äôt like Frank Ntilikina, Killian legit has so much potential. Just cause Cade is the main ball handler doesn‚Äôt mean Killian will bust - in fact, Killian‚Äôs had his best games this season at the 2. Its wayyyy too early to sell on him, ion want no 15th pick for this stud."
"When your other PG is Killian Hayes, you dont worry too much about fit bringing in Cade."
Killian Hayes will be our point guard. No worries there from me.
"Detroit can try to trade Killian Hayes before he loses all his value in the next 2-3 years. To be honest, I don‚Äôt see Hayes really being part of their long term plans, even if he was a lottery pick last year."
"I mean, Pistons potential roster in 2-3 years:  G/W Killian Hayes  G/W Cade Cunningham  W/F Jerami Grant  W/F Saddiq Bey  F/C Isaiah Stewart   Bench:  G/W Hamidou Diallo  G Saben Lee  W/F Deividas Sirvydis  W/F Sekou Doumbouya   Plus any other draft picks or FA signings. I like that roster, tbh"
It's surprising this wasn't written by KOC because who else on earth would care about fitting your number one pick next to Killian Hayes.
Ringer also had Killian Hayes head and shoulders above anyone else last draft. Let's pump the brakes on their draft analysis.
And that‚Äôs not even including Killian Hayes
"That's such a cool lineup, their young core is all 6'7 (Bey) and 6'8 (Stewart, Cade) but with vastly different still sets, then add in Killian Hayes who's got a 6'8 wingspan and 6'8 Jerami Grant..  I just think it's neat."
And Killian Hayes would go undrafted lmao
"‚ÄúKillian Hayes, however, *would* go 1st overall in the 2021 draft. Detroit keeps winning and winning.‚Äù"
KOC thought Killian Hayes would be the best player in the draft so this neckbeard can fuck off
"Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee  Corey Joseph, Josh Jackson, Hami Diallo, Sekou Doumbouya, Isaiah Stewart  Is this likely what you guys will look like? Or do you think a few players might be moved? Ala Plumlee and Joseph."
"Disagree with Pistons. The young guys were fun to watch this year. Jeremi Grant was a MIP candidate, Bey and Stewart were All Rookie team, Killian Hayes played well towards the end of the season. And guys like Josh Jackson filled role player spots. And now they have the number one pick"
Pistons have Killian Hayes to be the playmaker regardless
Killian Hayes is now destined for a Jalen Brunson type role
"Yo, the Pistons actually have some solid pieces in place to build around a top pick, especially Cade. Killian Hayes is a high potential rookie guard, Jeremi Grant can provide a leadership role and keep games competitive, Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart were 1st and 2nd All-Rookie team this year."
I'm happy for the Pistons. Grant/Bey/Cunningham is a nice core. I wonder what they do with Killian Hayes? Trade for a future FRP? The Pistions should try for flexibility because I believe Cunningham will have an immediate impact on winning. Want to avoid what's going on with Luka Doncic.
rip Killian Hayes
Killian Hayes looked fucking abysmal this year.
what happens to Killian Hayes with Cade coming in?
SAY KILLIAN HAYES ONE MORE TIME I DARE YOU
Killian Hayes and Christian Wood maybe available?
Killian Hayes in shambles
I honestly have little faith in Killian but I could see it. But I‚Äôd much rather have Suggs fueling our rebuild over Hayes
Are the rockets really better than the pistons right now? Pistons also have saddiq bey and Stewart to surround cade with and another playmaker in killian hayes so cade doesn‚Äôt have to handle all playmaking
"Thanks for saying that, I agree. But it's still unclear if Saddiq or Stew or Killian Hayes can be superstars and not just great pieces. We need a sure thing, or there's a chance our team becomes second-round fodder as it matures."
"Detroit? Wut  I mean Saddiq Bey is nice, Isaiah Stewart looks like he could develop into a good big man but I see fairly little else for optimism. Killian Hayes was injured for a lot of the season, not gonna judge him yet.  Orlando is fucking cursed with injuries lmao. Rockets' future will depend a lot on how the Nets picks they received in the Harden trade pans out.  And you really wanna disrespect the Hawks after what they did this season with one of the youngest rosters in the league?"
Deleted it after the Killian Hayes take
Kevin O Killian Hayes
"the biggest of oofs.  And this year taking Killian Hayes over Haliburton is looking rough, too soon to tell for sure obviously."
"We have 2 rookies on All-Rookie teams, killian hayes, jerami grant, and Cade Cunningham."
"Jerami Grant, Killian Hayes"
"I really hope Killian Hayes is a beast, Detroit need something good lol"
Does Killian Hayes suck this much?
So far Killian Hayes has never lost a playoff series
"It's this type of nephew comments on this sub that piss me off. Killian hayes vs russel westbrook, seriously??"
"Because Russ is one of the worst starting PGs in the league?  If Killian Hayes got booed, no one would talk about it.  Same principle applies here"
Bro. Killian Hayes is an NBA starter
Killian Hayes for Coby White? Highly doubt the bulls would accept this but I‚Äôd be down
Killian Hayes is the longest-tenured player on the Pistons.
Killian Hayes is shooting 40% from 3 lol
KOC lost all credibility permanently with his take on Killian Hayes.
Killian Hayes will cap out as Rondo-lite.  Drummond could've gone down in history as the Piston's leading rebounder (or even the all time leading rebounder) if Detroit never traded him.
"Killian being bad is one of the draft predictions that I nailed. He has no athleticism and limited skills. He was severely overhyped   Sorry man. Maybe look at it as, you got Hayes so he could lead you to Cade lol"
Answer to everything applicable other than rookies is  Killian Hayes being this bad
not all of them though.  killian hayes was absolute garbage.
Cade needs to hurry back to save Detroit fans from having to watch Killian Hayes 1-11 fg 2 points total in 2 games.
I‚Äôm not familiar with this Killian Hayes fellow. Is he on our team?

Nah but Killian Hayes is not great at actually generating offense. They'll still be bad but they would be actually building up something
pistons fans ‚Äî is killian hayes a bum? ive honestly never watched detroit since before he was drafted but it seems like he always has the worst stat lines
how did killian hayes look
I have to watch this Killian Hayes guy playing so I can laugh with the Kevin O'Connor jokes.
Killian hayes is awful
"killian hayes is really gonna put you guys over the top, amazing point guard prospect. he might even average over 5ppg this year. deadly young core out in detroit"
Killian Hayes
"Luka‚Äôs potential was his biggest question mark.   Also there‚Äôs no point to compare Luka‚Äôs potential to Lamelo (for the sake of where they were drafted) since they were in different draft classes. You should compare it to Ayton who was a 6‚Äô11 250 lbs athlete with a 40+ inch vertical.   And no, what you are saying doesn‚Äôt make sense. Lamelos potential was compared to guys like Wiseman, Edwards, Okorro, Killian Hayes, where Luka‚Äôs potential was compared to Ayton, MPJ, Bagley, Young, JJJ.   So maybe read what I typed first about the disparity between draft class talent, since you failed to recognize that and continue to compare Luka to Lamelo"
Killian Hayes.
Think you forgot killian hayes. Dude was on fire last night üò¢üî´
"1. I hope the Pistons young core takes a leap this season, especially Killian Hayes as a guard beside Cade. NBA is more fun when the Pistons are good, atleast for me.  2. The Heat make the Finals, just so the Lowry propaganda transcends just Raptors fans and advanced stats nerds. Never underestimate the heart of a champion - Alex Wong‚Ñ¢Ô∏è  3. Timberwolves make a deep playoffs run, just cause that fanbase deserves it after all the bullshit they had to go through and so KAT gets some respect put on his name as a legit top 10 guy.  4. Sixers play ""better"" without Simmons on the team, just so that they aren't pressured to bend over for him. Embiid stays healthy the whole season and wins MVP.  5. Expansion talks come up and Seattle gets the SuperSonics."
"Yis I'm going for the Pistons slot.   We are finally in full rebuild mode! These are a brand new Pistons. Off the car lot new. Our longest tenured player on our roster is 2020 7th overall pick starting PG Killian Hayes. On opening night vs Chicago he attempted to be tank commander with 0 pts/5 rebs/2 ast/2 TO on 0/6 shooting in 20 mins. G leaguers normally don't start in the NBA. YEESH! New players of note: 1st overall draft pick 'Motor' Cade Cunningham and 2nd round C (NCAA POTY) Luka Garza along with FA signees Kelly Olynyk (can he sustain success from his time in Houston?) and former lottery pick backup F/C Trey Lyles ([Can he get over his distaste for Detroit?](https://www.deseret.com/2018/4/3/20627163/former-utah-jazz-player-trey-lyles-rips-on-utah-quin-snyder-s-practices)). Our 2nd year tank should be aided by Cade injuring his ankle in preseason - which will keep him out likely until after the team's first road trip of the season (at a minimum). Returning players of note include (Ben Wallace mentored) 6'9"" C Isaiah 'Beef Stew' Stewart and sharp shooting SF Saddiq Bey - both alternates for the U.S. Olympic team - as well as Olympian (and 2nd in Most Improved Player voting) F Jeremy Grant. We will be exciting at times, but mostly sucktastic, until we get more players to space the floor."
The ringer had Killian hayes ahead of him on their big board. He was far from a lock
+17 happens when your matchup is Killian Hayes
Your obsession with killian hayes is really weird
So much for the off-season Killian Hayes hype‚Ä¶
Killian Hayes over Haliburton...  What a terrible pick.
Our resident Killian Hayes hater is back
Is Killian Hayes a bust?
"2011-2012 lineup: Brandon Knight, Rodney Stuckey, Tayshaun Prince, Jason Maxiell, Greg Monroe  2021-2022 lineup: Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, Isaiah Stewart  One backcourt of the future vs. another backcourt of the future. All I know is I have a good feeling about Brandon Knight moving forward."
"Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Beef Stew, Cade. Not biased or anything."
how is it different to drafting killian hayes in the lottery
Bro told me Killian Hayes was the next James Harden
Scathing take on Killian Hayes too
Kevin O‚ÄôConnor out here in full force.   Next thing we‚Äôre gonna see is a ‚Äú don‚Äôt sleep on Killian Hayes‚Äù post
"According to my in-depth analysis of Basketball GM, the top 5 guards in 2026 will be:  1. Trae Young 2. Killian Hayes 3. Luka Doncic 4. Tyler Herro 5. Ben Simmons"
No Killian Hayes will
I bet Killian Hayes gets a lot of hate if he has a fought season. Hope the dude can show *something* this year
Killian Hayes or Cade Cunningham. an accomplice might be Isaiah Stewart.
Yeah come on dude.  Killian Hayes would be lucky to be half the player Ben Simmons is now even with the flaws.  Cade has way higher upside obviously but Killian looks like a backup if your lucky.
"In the quote he was talking about his goals and how he believes he‚Äôs in the group of up and coming young players who are gonna be all stars. He mentioned guys who are obviously franchise players compared to him but he‚Äôs also a top 5 player in his draft class, it‚Äôs not that unreasonable for him to think he can be in that category. If he said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm better than these guys‚Äô then obviously it deserves clowning but he specifically said he considers himself one of the up and coming young players in the league which is totally fair. He‚Äôs a lot closer to them than people in this thread are making out, which was my point. He‚Äôs not gonna say ‚Äòyea I wanna be considered with Killian Hayes and Jarrett Culver‚Äô. Considering this dude compared it to a guy in the YMCA saying he could be on the Lakers, you can see how disrespectful the comments are."
"""Inject the Cade Cunningham/Killian Hayes/Saddiq Bey/Jerami Grant/Isaiah Stewart lineup into my veins""  Zach gets it."
MVP: Luka Doncic  MIP: Killian Hayes  DPOY: Rudy Gobert  6MOY: Alex Caruso  ROTY: Ben Simmons (obviously)
"KOC was wrong about Killian Hayes, but he was right about Brandon Ingram being better than Ben Simmons."
"Russell might legitimately be the least athletic starting PG in the entire league.  Well, him or Killian Hayes.    Super skilled though."
"Anthony Edwards, Isaiah Stewart, Tyrese Haliburton, Killian Hayes, Tyrese Maxey, Xavier Tillman, Isaac Okoro  I‚Äôm not sure if what to expect from Poku this season, but I‚Äôm really rooting for him and hoping he makes a jump this season"
Simmons to the Pistons for Killian Hayes
"He shot the ball really well in summer league from deep, not sure I‚Äôd be messing with that kid too much. Killian Hayes on the other hand could use some help."
"No. Chad Ford put it well on his podcast last week so I'll summarize. I would highly recommend if you're looking for draft coverage. As far as podcasts go, I'd say he's on par with Givony &amp; Schmitz.  1. The Euro league teams have no incentive to develop players so they can declare for the draft unless those players are advanced enough that they can help them win immediately. Considering there's a rise in competition and everything else that comes with playing professionally, unless said youth prospect left for Europe for at least 2 or more years, spent time getting little minutes and earning more faith from coaching, it's just not to their benefit.  So you can the difference in the amount of minutes and role an Alperin Sengun got as compared to Luka Samanic for example. Or even, Doncic Vs Killian Hayes. And why comparatively of the two, even the coverage was about flashes of brilliance for Hayes &amp; Samanic versus actual current production for Doncic and Sengun.  2. Not when they can go to Australia, the Overtime league, the G league or universities chasing one and dones.   This year should be extremely interesting for prospects. With all the available options. So if you listen to the podcast pasted below, you'd hear the breakdown on each interesting international prospect and why they chose either of all the available options.  https://open.spotify.com/episode/1BCHsH1UfpxoEYSXOCubc6?si=RDB19CMuScmFa_4O70LBaA&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;dl_branch=1"
Yes that is my point all those guys can shoot but Killian Hayes can‚Äôt. His shot preparation on catch and shoot shots is broken
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."
"Nikeil Alexander Walker, Killian Hayes, Deangelo Russell (people know he‚Äôs good but he‚Äôs been passed around a lot because no one thinks they can win with him), Cam Reddish, Tyler Herro, Colin Sexton, Markelle Fultz."
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
2016: Taurean Prince ---&gt; Papagiannis                        De'Andre Bembry --&gt; Malachi Richardson  2017: John Collins --&gt; Harry Giles  2018: Trae Young --&gt; Mo Bamba                        Kevin Huerter --&gt; Josh Okogie   2019: De'Andre Hunter --&gt; Darius Garland             Cam Reddish --&gt; Cam Johnson  2020: Onyeka Okongwu --&gt; Killian Hayes   Uhh can we just have our picks lol
"Rose is all class, and he loves the 6 man role. He even made way for *Killian Hayes* and let him start lol"
TBF Cavs fan here. Pistons fans are insanely high on Killian Hayes. Had some nice/flashy passes last year but I don't get the hype
Killian Hayes is not terrible.
everything about killian hayes
7 is the number Killian Hayes wears. They're just making sure everyone knows to be prepared for when he turns into a super star. That's all. üòÅ
"KOC was one of the few who had Ingram ranked over Simmons before the draft, maybe that cancels out his Killian Hayes take?"
well he's no Killian Hayes that's for sure
How did he drop into the second round?  Also for my patented phrase: BETTER than Killian Hayes
Killian Hayes. The kid we drafted when we should‚Äôve took Hailiburton.
"Overrated: Plumlee. Everyone thought Weaver was crazy for signing him but he has kept us be relatively competitive while tanking. And he got his first triple double!  Underrated: Saben Lee. Hes put up some good numbers lately but he still has a lot to show and has been very aggressive at the rim which is refreshing considering how Killian Hayes, who was supposed to be in Lee's spot at this time in the season, performed."
Dont forget Killian Hayes is also injured and DRose got traded before this guy started gettin minutes
Only draft scout I know who had Killian Hayes #1 was Kevin O‚ÄôConnor and he seemed to waiver on that when he got hurt.
"Bunch of draft scouts also had Killian Hayes as the number 1. In the draft community that I interacted with, Ant was the best prospect on most people‚Äôs boards."
While no one drafted rookies in my fantasy league I went for LaMelo and Haliburton and couldn‚Äôt be happier.  (Also drafted Killian Hayes but had to drop him after week 2)
"Yep! Hes been so good. Its crazy it took a Delon Wright, Killian Hayes, And Ellington injury to see him unleashed. Weaver really hit on 3/4 picks and Killian may not be a bust (we have to see him play more than 7 games)"
"First of all, Wiseman didn‚Äôt get a decreased role as he is playing the same amount of minutes as he always had. You keep bringing up he‚Äôs getting benched but in reality his role is still the same bc he still is playing more min than Looney who is the starting center. 2nd, his numbers are as good as they appear and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs an anomaly to me that he‚Äôs playing so few minutes. I understand that in bad games, he should play little min but why is he playing so few min in good games as well? My main point is that Wiseman playing so few min is not his fault. You act like it‚Äôs his fault he‚Äôs not playing so few min when I disagree heavily. I think he‚Äôs performing better than rookies that are averaging more minutes than him like payton pritchard, Saddiq Bey, Cole Anthony, killian hayes, Isaac okoro, etc. I really think that the only rookies performing better than him that are averaging more minutes are Lamelo and Haliburton. I don‚Äôt see how Wiseman is playing so bad to the point where he deserves less minutes than those other guys."
"Pistons  Bey is as advertised. Shooters shoot. Can't believe he dropped to 19  Isaiah Stewart is also as advertised. Slow, prehistoric, and useless on both ends of the floor if he isn't under the rim.   Killian Hayes is out with a significant hip injury. When he did play we were talking about sending him to the G League. The Killian Hayes hype was a hoax."
"Lol KOC said killian hayes was a better prospect than lamelo, ant, and wiseman. He doesn‚Äôt know shit."
"Kevin O Connor said Killian Hayes was a better prospect than Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, and Lamelo Ball lmao. Listen to this guy speak and you know he's never picked up a ball in his life."
Killian Hayes is easily the best prospect in this draft
Killian hayes being a budget Elf isn't saying much lol
"So maybe reading comprehension isn't your strong suit. He said pistons are fools for   1) Bad draft picks 2) bad trades   And you're out here flexing about drafting middleton (traded after one meh rookie season) and dinwiddie (two bad seasons and walked? Cut? Idk) doesn't matter if you drafted them if they never performed for you.   Let's look at your other picks  2020 - killian hayes (project pick so he gets some leeway but bad as a rookie, gets injured, out for season)  2019 - sekou (has shown flashes but is looking pretty bad overall)  2018 - no firsts, traded for blake who had one good season and is now one of the worst players in the nba not even taking into account his contract  2017 - kennard (ok player, traded for Sadiq who looks like a promising roleplayer)  2016 - henry ellenson (???)  2015 - stanley johnson (bad)  2014 - dinwiddie (been over this)  2013 - KCP (improved after leaving, pretty bad in detroit)   So in conclusion: for the most part the pistons have either   A. Drafted poorly B. Developed poorly C. Signed people like Josh Smith  That's OK, it looks like they're making progress but I don't know why you're being sensitive about your team's shitty history and talking up players you essentially didn't even develop."
I'll take it.   I went into this past year's draft hearing great things about Killian Hayes but not know much about Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart. Now Bey and Stew might be my two favorite Pistons. They've been a lot of fun to watch this year.
Troy Weaver won‚Äôt get it because the pistons are bad but he‚Äôs been unbelievable given what he inherited:   - Drafted ROTY candidate Saddiq Bey  - Drafted absolute stud Isaiah Stewart   - Signed Jerami Grant to a moderate deal who‚Äôs now taken the leap to All Star level   - Signed Delon Wright who‚Äôs now viewed as an asset  - Signed Mason Plumlee who‚Äôs now viewed as an asset   - Signed Josh Jackson who has been incredible  - Traded an expiring Derrick Rose for a second and Dennis Smith Jr who continues to look better by the game   and none of this is including the drafting of Killian Hayes who we have no idea what he can become
How has Killian Hayes been?
"we have two young french dudes, Killian Hayes or Sekou Doumbouya?"
Killian hayes catching a stray lmao
"we have fallen upwards several times in the last couple years. There's a very probable timeline in which Terry doesn't randomly blow up as a shooter, we don't get our first lottery luck in 21 years and end up picking 7th and taking someone like Killian Hayes in the 2020 draft"
If Killian Hayes can start then A1 can start
"Bruce brown unfortunately didn‚Äôt really have a place on our team. We had drose, and just drafted killian at the 1 so we wanted to give him plenty of minutes to develop. Our other guards are Josh Jackson (whose def an improvement of Bruce brown), svi who is intriguing and I believe still has room to develop, saddiq bey who we just drafted whose been playing minutes at multiple positions, and Wayne Ellington who is a great veteran to have and has been killing it this season. We had too many players at that position and while he was good on defense Bruce‚Äôs scoring did not have the same ceiling as the other guys. His playmaking is good, but seems like there just wasn‚Äôt enough for weaver to want to keep him as a point guard after drafting hayes"
"Yeah, I could see that. I guess I just don‚Äôt see the purpose of it, unless you think he can develop into a serviceable player. I‚Äôd rather give Killian Hayes those minutes though"
"Too hard to tell, Killian only played one game with Cade. I just know that Cade needs the ball in has hands more than Killian, it shouldn't be 50/50 like it was in Cade's one game. Casey is way too content to let Cade sit in the corner will Hayes attempts to run the offense. Maybe it will be different with a healthy Cade."
what happened to killian hayes
Killian Hayes is so bad
Yeah Killian Hayes is god awful. He's shooting 26% from the field this year.   KOC was so wrong about him.
Casey is a bad coach. Killian Hayes was playing well so he gets 7 second half minutes because we need to develop 30 year old Corey Joseph apparently
Killian Hayes not going under the radar for me.   That dude absolute booty ass.
Killian Hayes
Killian Hayes lol (sorry pistons fans)
me watching Killian Hayes thinking he‚Äôs Cade
"You didn‚Äôt prove shit, you said his FG% is average so he‚Äôs not a good shooter (he shot 40% from 3?) and that he‚Äôs not a better passer than Simmons/Killian Hayes (based on what?)"
Yet he still did better than Killian Hayes.  Feels bad for KOC
killian hayes 2
Remind me to buy stock in Killian Hayes in the 2023 off-season.
"Good first look at Cade. But man, I've seen enough of Killian Hayes. YIKES"
Good. I can't watch another possession of Killian Hayes running offense.
It's possible for Killian Hayes to be top 5 not probable
"Shoutout Scottie and GTJ  I‚Äôm really glad Suggs had a good game, he needed it. He was looking like Killian Hayes for a minute.   Both rookies will be great players"

Sixers literally don‚Äôt have a point guard and I‚Äôd still rather have nothing than Killian Hayes
Killian Hayes absolute freaking booty lol
Didn‚Äôt Tyrese‚Äôs agent tell teams to pass on him because he wanted to be in Sac? Also way too early to make a call on Killian Hayes.
Maybe the more accurate take is he‚Äôs one of 5 guys capable of making a pass like that every game multiple times.   Yeah it‚Äôs cool some rookies are adding difficult passes like this to their game but you got like 4 highlights for Killian Hayes and you‚Äôre trying to compare ppl like that to Harden. James does this multiples times every single game. What‚Äôs a career highlight for another player is just another play of countless many for playmakers of his caliber.
"Imagine how good they'd be if they had taken Haliburton instead of Obi Toppin! Seriously, he could have taken Payton's minutes (during which they were outscored on the season) and also played off the ball with Rose in closing lineups. And he can defend too. Would have been a great fit, man.  I can't say anything, my dumbass disaster of a team took Killian Hayes. I've enjoyed watching this Knicks team, they play their asses off every night. Randle is just damn good and RJ Barrett improved tremendously from last year.  Too bad there aren't many good free agents this year, they'd actually be an attractive destination for once. Who's available the summer after this one?"
Killian Hayes (Pistons rookie PG) made arguably a better pass than this a couple games ago
Killian Hayes isn't making that pass every other game. Stop it.
lol chill rookies like Killian Hayes &amp; Lamelo Ball make that pass every other game

"I was born in New Jersey and was a Nets fan growing up. Moved to Detroit recently, and there's no way in hell I'm leaving the fanbase with Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kai Irving for one with Jerami Grant, Killian Hayes, and Isaiah Stewart. I'll watch Pistons games and hope they win, but they'll take the backseat."
"I don't really understand how viewership figures work is that viewers per game or overall. Because fewer games hurts. But so many teams are just blatantly tanking this year and so many stars have been hurt. Plus half the top rookies have been injured for a decent amount of time which makes bad teams less fun to watch. (Wiseman, Lamelo, Deni, Toppins barely played, Killian Hayes, Cole Anthony etc.)"
"Killian Hayes gets a shot boost. Suddenly he is an excellent passer, shooter and defender with size at the PG position.   Saddiq Bey gets the athleticism boost. A lights out shooter with the ability to attack the basket and finish at the rim.   Isaiah Stewart has 3 inches added to his frame. He goes from being an undersized C to a top-level talent."
"Might not perfect to give my take but here goes. I think Killian can be a guy that‚Äôs too 10 passer, and maybe Cade can be a top 10 scorer. Maybe Case can be both but having Cade gives us our starting 5 for as long as we got Jerami. Killian, Cade, Bey, Grant, Stewart. That would give us the 2nd best passer, and a top 3 3pt shooter, and maybe one of the more versatile ‚Äúbigs‚Äù (6‚Äô8 oof but that‚Äôs our baby Ben with offense) and Grant is like pre-superstar PG without the silky jumper and just assaults the rim harder. We literally would have a starting 5 we could just run for as long as Jerami is in his prime. Would come down to keeping atleast 4 players from consecutive drafts. We would have a better first option in Cade/Grant, and an elite second option in the other. I think Bey can be a third scorer on a Championship team in his prime, Killian I expect to be somewhere between Rubio and TP but more capable on D. Which I think could end up fitting with this teams construct. The. Beef Stew is a dude that shoots 55% on 2‚Äôs and 30+ from 3 rn, with a better functioning team and being the 5th option could have a guy that shoots &gt; 60% from 2, and 35%. Honestly Cade could give us a team that I would compare to the actual 04 Pistons, our ultimate weakness based on my personal assumptions, is Stewart is 6‚Äô8 (Plumlee is perfect for the off the bench role for now and when we probably trade him we have a gm that can give us a 7 footer to match up.) Offensively we need Killian and Stew to be a actual clips on offense and the Pistons can run a everybody eats offense having 5 real shooters. Between the potential playmaking of Hayes, Cade, Stew then having to pure scorers offensively in Grant and Bey would think they have one of the best 5 man cores moving forward. Grant will be early 30‚Äôs when these dudes hit their primes. Our gm should be able to get one guard for off the bench playmaking, cheap shooters, and a cheap bench big. He was already proved this having done all of that his first off season as GM which has been the best I have seen since at least the Pistons 04 season. If the Pistons don‚Äôt get Cade that would suck, he probably will fit with us best. We are literally a lead scoring guard away from having a 5 players we could maybe run with the next 3-5 years. And he fits!!! So he can step up and walk into a role he should play. Another thing to watch would be Killian taking the step as an actual starter and not a talent flasher. And if that is all he is then the Pistons could just get a BPA if they get Cade. Cade, Bey, Grant and Stew can all play 2-3 positions each so we don‚Äôt have to get overly specific and can insert a player at just about any position. If we get our 5 and they develop into real players like they shown then I think that‚Äôs a lot of length and switch ability and will have an exciting team that can be a problem"
"Not even mad at him just a little critical of him because he's far from the best analyst. Yet The Ringer is trying to make him this draft guru giving him a lot of resources and a platform with his extensive mock drafts. How much does he really know about player evaluation and development? About as much as most other NBA journalists. What makes KOC special on this subject? Nothing.  Killian Hayes is super young and may end up being a great player but ESPN just had a re-draft on one of their podcasts and Hayes didn't go in the top 14.   Givony wasn't even certain that Hayes would go in the top 12 in the last draft and KOC had Hayes as his number one most talented in the draft. That tells you everything you need to know about KOC as a basketball mind.    Most people on this sub seem to think KOC is among the greatest writers ever on the topic of the NBA. Perhaps it is because this sub must have a very young average age and fit the demographics of exactly the target audience The Ringer seeks.  The fact there are several better writers at the same publication should tell you how average KOC really is when you compare him throughout the industry. In my opinion KOC isn't even bad, he's just middle of the pack and there are so many others whose opinion and words I value more than him.  People reading this can downvote to oblivion but when critical thinking and nuance comes into consideration most people in this sub can't even handle that and vote down."

"Makes me sad the Pistons missed him.  Cerebral, height, good vision over athleticism and pure offense, which is the same comp as Hayes.

That‚Äôs crazy. I forgot Killian Hayes isn‚Äôt even American. It‚Äôs been So long since I‚Äôve thought about the Pistons and who they have. But even if K Hayes has game. He won‚Äôt reach his full potential in Detroit. Nobody does.
 Based off the fact you liked Killian Hayes coming out of COLLEGE I‚Äôm going to take a wild guess and say you didn‚Äôt even know his name before draft night.
Killian Hayes just sneezed somewhere.
"All depends on whether Killian Hayes and Saddiq Bey take another step or not, I could definitely see them being a pretty good team next year given a top 4 pick"
"""Living in someone's head rent free"" means you don't have any reason to think about someone but you're always talking about them.  Killian Hayes was supposed to be the first cornerstone of a new rebuild on my favorite basketball. That's a reason for me to talk about him.

"You can both be biased and have dumbass takes. Like saying Robert Williams is a top 7 center in the league.   I‚Äôm biased, Killian Hayes is the best point guard in history. That‚Äôs not a dumb take cause I recognize my bias!"
"If we land a top 3 pick in the next draft we‚Äôd have a super super bright future. We currently have a rookie in the top 3 of the rookie ladder &amp; another one at 7. Our other rookie Killian Hayes is an elite passer at 19, Lamelo-level."

"Mobley is a weird fit on the Pistons for me, they already have Isaiah Stewart/Saddiq Bey/Sekou who can theoretically be their starting frontcourt; I'm relatively low on Sekou but I think the other two have great upside. Suggs would be a really good fit with Killian Hayes and they don't have great guards after Hayes."
"Here's a few more.   Isaiah Stewart is better than James Wiseman.   While Tyrese Haliburton is better currently, Killian Hayes will be better in his prime.   Duncan Robinson's season last year was a fluke. He's still an elite shooter, but hes never going to shoot 46% on 8 threes per game ever again. Probably more like 39-40% (which is still good).   Saddiq Bey is better than Blake Griffin.   If Kawhi Leonard wasn't an MVP candidate playing 78% of the games last season, Embiid shouldn't be an MVP candidate playing 68% of his games.   Donovan Mitchell is the Jazz's best player. It becomes obvious in the playoffs imo.  Curry is more valuable to the Warriors than Harden is to the Nets.   Not all players who put up good numbers on a bad team are empty stats players."

Lmao I find that even more ridiculous. Steph I understand cuz he's probably prevented a lot of their favorite players/teams from winning championships. What the heck has Killian Hayes done in the NBA to make you hate him that much lol
"It's really the same for most players. I've seen this guy who religiously hates on Killian Hayes. Like, to on insane level. How sad do you have to be to get on reddit every day to hate on a 19 year old kid who has played less than 15 gamea?"

Man killian Hayes is balling out and he‚Äôs honestly pretty handsome
Killian Hayes üëÄ
Killian ‚ÄúJason Williams‚Äù Hayes  My god what a pass
"For the Pistons: Killian Hayes, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Sekou Doumbouya and Isaiah Stewart"
"Idk about that, Killian Hayes üëÄ.       Joking aside, draft guides and mocks aren't useful if everyone is putting out the exact same thing, shame that's the last time he will ever take a big swing like that (or at least till Hayes vindicates him)."
Killian Hayes and Sadiq are gonna be great to pair with the star you get in the draft
"Really sucks for his much needed development.  If it gives you any solace, Killian Hayes looked really bad, then injured his hip &amp; missed 4 months, and came back looking a million times better and more confident. The time off let him study the game more, watch his team, and gave him a chip on his shoulder. Hopefully James comes back stronger than ever"

Looking at their depth chart:  PG: Killian Hayes / CoJo / Saben Lee  SG: Cade / Frank Jackson / Josh Jackson  SF: Jerami Grant / Hamidou / Josh Jackson  PF: Saddiq Bey / Trey Lyles / Sekou  C: Olynyk / Beef Stew  I mean yeah I think he's firmly in the third string right now. I could see him fighting for second-string minutes against either Jackson or Hamidou.  I'm still rooting for the guy and I think even if Detroit lets him go some team will take a flier on him. Kind of surprised Memphis got rid of him in the first place.
should we be worried Killian Hayes compares unfavorably to Mudiay's rookie year?
Theo Maledon over Killian Hayes all day
 It‚Äôs just summer league but it‚Äôs   Cole Anthony  Evan Mobley  Killian Hayes
Cade is injured    https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2021/08/14/pistons-cade-cunningham-killian-hayes-out-summer-league-matchup-injuries/8140385002/
IMO:  1. LaMelo Ball 2. Anthony Edwards  3. Tyrese Halliburton  4. Patrick Williams  5. James Wiseman 6. Isiah Stewart 7. Isaac Okoro 8. Saddiq Bey 9. Onyeka Okungwu (injury concern made me put him lower than I‚Äôd like). 10. Cole Anthony 11. Desmond Bane 12. Tyrese Maxsey 13. Kira Lewis Jr. 14. Killian Hayes

"Killian Hayes &gt; Booker, no bias at all"
Killian Hayes.
Killian Hayes &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Killian Hayes.
Killian Hayes
"Killian Hayes, granted I just really enjoy Kevin O‚ÄôBenSimmonsShouldShootWithHisRightHand‚Äôs content, but he really sold me on Hayes. He legitimately seems to have the skills, just has to polish it, which he will with experience. Don‚Äôt project him as a superstar though, but at least a couple All-NBA selection at the least."
"Killian Hayes is alright, hasn‚Äôt been great but it‚Äôs too early to give up on him since he hasn‚Äôt even played a full season of nba basketball. He‚Äôs left handed and isn‚Äôt very good at dribbling or driving with his weaker right hand, a good midrange shooter but bad from three. He‚Äôs a pretty good passer tho so he has playmaking potential. His most promising asset is his on ball defense"
Who is Cades back count mate? Most of the stuff I heard about Killian Hayes  wasn't great. Only watched the games against Portland thought so.
Being better than Killian Hayes is not a flex
"Tre Jones, Matisse, Killian Hayes"
Running point Killian Hayes is asking to lose games
Killian Hayes is definitely an early contender for most breedable
"Collet put him in at times to lockdown guards who was giving us problems but yeah he was not gonna get more minutes than Fournier, De Colo or Heurtel who are more balanced players and can get the offense going. Batum and TLC also provided solid perimeter defense, so it's hard to find him a spot. With Heurtel and Nando being 32 and 34, he might get more chances in the future, but Killian Hayes and Th√©o Mal√©don should join the NT soon so it's tough to say."
I can‚Äôt even imagine what would‚Äôve happened if this was Killian Hayes.   Cool stuff though.
"Definitely way too soon to judge Killian Hayes, the kid hasn't even played 30 games yet."
"Frank Ntilikina, Sekou Doumbouya, and soon Killian Hayes. So many questionable picks from France"
"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"&gt;Knowing Casey, we will see a LOT of Cory Joseph, Killian Hayes and Cade Cunningham lineup wih Cade playing SF  I don't think you will see a ""lot"" of that.  Casey and the front office have stressed how important shooting is this year. For that reason, Frank Jackson &amp; Saddiq Bey will be playing a lot of SG/SF.  Also, if we re-sign Hamidou Diallo (which I expect), there is another guy who will be playing at the SF spot."
"Killian Hayes looked scared as shit last year.  Awful pick, hope Cade does better for you guys."
Yikes Killian Hayes
Like Killian Hayes
"Yeah Cade was really solid today. Had fun playing snip snap at the highlights comment section calling Cade and Green scrubs and GOATs simultaneously.Personally,  I wanna see him assert his will more whenever Killian Hayes does something stupid."
Killian Hayes meanwhile doesn‚Äôt look like he even belongs out there in the summer league
I feel like I have heard Jay Bilas talking about Killian Hayes for four years.
he spent half the game as a post up shooter with saben Lee and Killian Hayes ball handling. why? I do not know
"shoot 4-9 too for 3, the rest of the team shoot 3-26  Coach is trying to make Lee, Hayes and Cade work together.   Lee as primary ball handler, Hayes more of a 2, and Cade working as SF.  shit looked terrible vs okc and looked terrible today, if Cade is always in the corner playing SF, is a bit harder to drawing FT.  Knowing Casey, we will see a LOT of Cory Joseph, Killian Hayes and Cade Cunningham lineup wih Cade playing SF.  Pain."
"Fuck that Saben Lee ball stopping shit, and that Killian Hayes secondary ball handler shit. Just give Cade the ball."
"Lot of comments from people who didn't watch the game.   Killian Hayes played a hell of a game. Both Cade and Killian will be the primary ballhandler at times, as they should be."
I loved Killian Hayes but he‚Äôs not good enough to take the ball off Cade. Cade‚Äôs clearly on another level as a passer/playmaker despite having wag less professional experience.
They need to get rid of Killian Hayes
Hayes cannot play with Cade long term imo. Pistons should try to actually trade Killian for some value when he has some now.
Killian Hayes has a loooooong way to go. man i was so high on him in the draft too
Killian Hayes is bad like the original meaning of the word bad. Does anyone see any upside?
Is it just me or did Killian Hayes grow??
"Why is killian hayes handling the ball in the 4thQ instead of cade, that dude is straight ass"
Killian Hayes been disappointing   He has all the tools tho
didn‚Äôt KOC have Killian Hayes ranked #1
Killian Hayes has a longggggggg way to go lol
Man Killian Hayes has been lowkey disappointing   I‚Äôd rather them just put the ball in Cades/Bey hand.
Jalen looks the same height as Killian Hayes who‚Äôs 6‚Äô5 I think it‚Äôs probably 6‚Äô5 to 6‚Äô7
thoughts on killian hayes?
Killian Hayes is niiice on defense
Killian Hayes is a legit on ball defender. Green may have the fastest first step in the league as a rookie. And Hayes is staying in front of him.
i just don't see it with killian hayes  sorry koc
"Theo Maledon, Killian Hayes, Sekou Doumbouya, Victor Wembanyama, Rudy Gobert."
Killian Hayes looks good tonight. Great defense. Has that floater going.
I‚Äôm not trying to hate rn but what is Killian Hayes good at?
"Couple things I‚Äôd love to address here.   1) the rumors are that Halliburton was telling teams not to pick him so he could go to Sacramento  2) Killian Hayes, Deni Avdija, *Jalen Smith*, and Devin Vassell were also picked in front of him, I‚Äôm not sure why obi and the Knicks are being singled out"
Compare him to Killian Hayes tonight. Killian is 6 ft 5. Cade is clearly taller.
"James Wiseman other than warriors players, Killian Hayes. Besides those guys maybe Brandon Clarke"
You might have another one in Killian Hayes
"Oh yeah him, Killian Hayes, and Doumbouya to name a few"
His jumper looked nice and that‚Äôs all that matters right now is that it translates well.  All the other stuff can come with more experience because he clearly has it in the pocket.  But the jumper more than translating is good news for him.  That being said Killian Hayes had the ball and Cade was spotting up way too much.
"Well, he'll be playing with solid young Center Beef Stew, borderline allstar and gold medalist Jerami Grant, Saddiq ""Young Buddy"" Bey and Killian Hayes. I think his assist numbers will be fine."
"People really think they know anything about Killian Hayes after one game. Please, if you've never watched a guy to play, dont act like you know about him."
So Killian Hayes huh
Not really he‚Äôs getting outplayed by killian hayes
killian hayes and cade look too similar from above  bad sign for pistons fans
Cade gotta have the ball to do what he needs to do in the  PnR. Having him stand to the side while Killian Hayes goes 1v1 kinda defeats the purpose of picking him first
you're right  killian hayes mvp
"Thank you for asking!  (in no particular order)  PG - Curry, Simmons, Fox, Killian Hayes, Rubio  SG - Kelly Oubre, Jalen Green, Lavine, Booker, Oladipo  SF - Tatum, Giannis, Aaron Gordon, Abdul Nader, Hayward  PF - Kuzma, Kevin Love, Hachimura, Ibaka, Obi Toppin  C - Nerlens Noel, Robert Williams III, Rudy Gobert, Daniel Gafford, Jarrett Allen"
is killian hayes good? honestly didn‚Äôt see much of him at all last year before he got injured.
Question for Cade now is how is he gonna score inside the arc efficiently. His percentage wasn't good in college.   Killian Hayes looks really good so far
"Cade looks short. Anyone else sea that. Similar size to 6'5"" killian Hayes and much shorter than giddy who I guess is 6'9"""
So I see Killian Hayes is still garbage. What a difference a year can make in the draft talent pool
Killian Hayes*
We have two young point guards who will be ready in no time with Killian Hayes and Theo Maledon.   De Colo will retire as one of the five or six best french player ever. And the perfect example of a player who could have played in the NBA but maximized his potential in Europe.
"Yabu, Frank, gobert, Evan are all 29 and below. Since 08?   Why didn‚Äôt Killian Hayes, Sekou, wanbanyema, maledon get an invite?   Idk basketball sets aren‚Äôt really much diff or difficult.. tbh gobert kinda kills sets too to get open shots at the perimeter where France doesn‚Äôt rly have those knockdown guys that would help from an advanced offensive system."
I assume Killian Hayes and Theo Maledon will also join the National Team as they develop and the current players get older.
In 3 years they‚Äôll have Killian Hayes and wembanyama. Batum will be gone probably but Rudy and wembayama will be a nightmare defensively for any team. France is definitely not going anywhere.
"Give France another star, maybe Theo Maledon and/or Killian Hayes becomes it, and it's possible they beat a young 2024 team that doesn't have KD, CP3, Lebron, Curry, Pop, etc."
Killian Hayes &gt; anyone else imo
"Bro I checked your comment history you were arguing in the draft sub yesterday saying you can‚Äôt stand Killian Hayes. You‚Äôre a fucking weirdo and you deserve to be insulted when you say shit like that   It was only stupid to you because you hate the Kid. I defended it fine, you did a terrible job of defending your position bringing up Stanley Johnson as if he was a great rookie lmao"
That‚Äôs exactly my feelings towards you about Killian Hayes lmao
"lol this guy has no idea what he's talking about. killian looked really good after his injury. his first few games happened before blake was gone. blake hogged the ball while simultaneously sandbagging and it affected everyone, especially a guy whose best skill is playmaking in hayes.  Hayes shows the foundation to be a great on-ball defender. no one overrates his defense, we just see the seeds of what could be.  His jumper isn't broken. he shot an extremely high ft%. the issue with his shot is the inconsistent arc, but when it's on, it's there. he literally needs a real offseason, a summer league, and like one mor year. he's shown a lot"
killian hayes is not good at all and jeff okudah getting beat by rookies in practice still should tell you what you need to know about him too
"Somebody here said that Russillo is the sports version of Joe Rogan and it totally makes sense.  Also Bill may be biased, but KOC has stranger biases imo, doubling down on Killian Hayes seems very risky in his job position"
"Nope Detroit has 7   Cade Cunningham, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Jerami Grant, Sekou Doumbouya, Saben Lee, and Isaiah Stewart."
"""Cade Cunningham out for season after breaking hand in Pistons brawl which also ends seasons of Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey &amp; Isaiah Stewart."""
Kid can be really good. He can do it all.   Really high on Vassell.. like Mike Ditka on Ricky Williams high.. KOC on Killian Hayes high.. lol
Killian Hayes promising   Lol if you say so. I‚Äôm sure the rest of your piston evaluations are just as grounded in reality haha
"Holy shit, why did I think it was Killian Hayes? Still awful."
I think Killian Hayes is going to breakout
"He has very consistently made really stupid moves in real time, and lucked out with the players becoming better than expected. For example, Rozier magically becoming an elite catch and shoot guy isn't some stroke of Kupchak genius. He brought him in to be a PG, which is not even the position he plays now. We'd still be a bottom feeder with no future if we hadn't lucked out in 2020 draft lottery and been in position to draft Killian Hayes instead of LaMelo. He has an eye for talent in the draft but is a piss poor general manager."
"Powell? I like his game, but I‚Äôd think he would want to start? Seems like the Pistons want to will with their young core? Unless Killian Hayes comes off the bench."
"Cade is versatile he can play 1-3 him and Dinwiddie can work together and I think Dinwiddie would fit well with Killian too. He could start on Detroit and they could have Hayes come off the bench and play against 2nd units, at the end of the day the man would still be playing 30+ minutes a game in a role where he would get adequate touches"
"Jordan Poole, JJJ, Josh Jackson, Malik Monk, hopefully Wiseman, Killian Hayes"
"Killian Hayes. He showed flashes on offense pre- and post-injury, and the defense is already good."
Killian Hayes and Deni Avdija I think
"Haliburton definitely has the potential to be an all star player, but I just don‚Äôt see the Kings ever having a record that allows him to get accolades like that. I hope I‚Äôm proven wrong, because I have nothing but love for the Sac fan base and they deserve some relief.   Cole Anthony and Killian Hayes are pretty volatile in my opinion, have potential to be pretty good, but could also just as easily bust. I‚Äôm super interested this season to see how they perform. Especially with Cade and Killian on the same court. Same goes with Immanuel Quickley, love that dude, I hope he continues to improve and just balls out.   Wiseman is being written off as a bust already and it‚Äôs so unbelievably premature. I think he has a ton of potential and a fantastic opportunity to improve and achieve. Of course, he could end up as a Bagley-esque player, but it‚Äôs too early, imho, to say he‚Äôs a bust.   In my opinion, I just think it‚Äôs a little early to call it for anyone, except for LaMelo, Edwards, and Haliburton. But even those three, I have a feeling, will have a sophomore slump, and any dip statistically is going to bring out the critics who haven‚Äôt been as vocal this season."
You can try to change your game to fit the NBA but that‚Äôs much easier said than done. He‚Äôs not going to beat you off the dribble or create his own shot at an elite level. Pistons fans saw this last year with Killian Hayes. Similar pass-first oversized point guards that lack athleticism and consistent shot-making. Killian definitely improved by the end of the year but his playmaking was significantly damaged by his inability to drive to draw the help defender for a kick out pass and his inability to hit a three reliably meant that the passing lanes were too clogged to make him effective. I see Giddey struggling in that same manner and believe both he and Hayes will require years to translate.
"sure. but he leaned about as heavily into his killian hayes take as i've ever seen any analyst on any platform, ever.  combine that with the rest of his board... he was very high on devin vassell, very low on patrick williams, wildly high on tyrell terry... all of his bold takes look like total misses so far. you're right that it's too early to judge, though.  and again, i actually think he's worth paying attention to regardless. everyone misses. not everyone is bold enough to have an independent take."
He had Killian Hayes first overall last year. He's trash at evaluating talent.
Isnt it a great feeling? We have a young group as well  PG: Cade Cunningham - 19  SG: Killian Hayes - 20  SF: Saddiq Bey - 22  PF: Jerami Grant - 27 (our old man in the lineup)  C: Isaiah Steward - 20  With some young dudes off the bench as well in Josh Jackson and Diallo
someone with lots of free time should grade the top 7 or so of these writers/analysts the past 4 or 5  years and see who's been most on target.  for example KOC had killian hayes as number 1 last year but he was one of the few who had tatum 2 in 2017.
This is the same guy that had Killian Hayes first overall on his draft board last year. His objectively terrible at evaluating talent. Why should anyone take his work seriously?
"With one pick to come, here's how Detroit's young roster now looks:  **PG:** Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee.   **SG:** Hami Diallo, Josh Jackson.  **SF:** Saddiq Bey.  **PF:** (Jerami Grant), Sekou Doumbouya.  **C:** Isaiah Stewart."
"Best day since the goin to work Pistons. Not just because of Cade either. Because of Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Killian Hayes last year. Our young core could be special together."
PG-Killian Hayes SG- Cade Cunningham SF- Saddiq Bey PF- Jerami Grant C- Isaiah Stewart  the future is bright in Detroit they just need a better coach
"I mean he nailed his first draft like i said tf. Two NBA All-Rookie team members, Killian Hayes who looked good after his injury, and Saben Lee who played really well for a second round pick."
&gt;Killian Hayes with the 7th pick  What do mean by ‚Äúnailing it‚Äù
You don‚Äôt like his analysis that Killian Hayes was the best prospect in last year‚Äôs draft?
"* Prestige of being a #1 pick.  * Solid young talent with no pressure to win immediately.  * #1 pick will make $4.5M more than the #2 pick over the course of the rookie contract.  I'd rather grow next to Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Sekou Doumbouya, Jerami Grant (and lots of cap flexibility) than wait out the John Wall/Eric Gordon cap-space-blackhole backcourt in Houston."
"Potential means they have the capacity to become something it doesn‚Äôt mean they do become something. An athlete can have long arms, great hip mobility, and quick feet and that would definitely mean they have great defensive potential, like Johnathon Kuminga. However that doesn‚Äôt mean he will turn into a great defender because there‚Äôs so many other intangibles that go into it like quick decision making and foresight. Capability is the key word here and Killian Hayes has shown capability."
"Hopefully they improve their draft analysis though. For example, I know it‚Äôs early but it‚Äôs questionable that they had Killian Hayes as the top prospect last year over Ball, Ant, etc."
I wasn't ready for Hawks fans to still be this high on Cam Reddish  Pistons fans seem pretty high on Killian Hayes when I'm not even sure he's an NBA player
Giddey reminds me of Killian Hayes last year
Killian Hayes might make me act up

"Killian hayes had a weird season due to first no offseason then getting injured. But he def showed flashes of what he‚Äôs capable of, and some of his best games playing side by side with saben lee, another pg.   Passing is great already and will probably be his best skill always. His pick and roll passing is good and his defense is already solid as well. It‚Äôs great cause a pairing of him and Cade at guard will be so large. Also, he‚Äôs a good rebounder for a guard.   Where he needs most work is in scoring. If he can improve his shooting numbers it‚Äôll benefit him a lot. Also, he‚Äôs not the best driver last season as he clearly favored his left hand. Also, in pick and roll he needs to be more aggressive in driving the ball. I think the coaches emphasized that and he improved a little bit towards the end last year, but there were still some times where he would go off a screen and drive and then back up from the paint looking to pass instead of just driving and scoring.   Overall, I‚Äôm excited to watch him cause he‚Äôs a fun player for sure. I think hell benefit playing with someone like Cade, which will also force him to improve his other skills in order to successfully play off ball with him. He‚Äôs stated multiple times last season he loved playing with another pg on the court so I‚Äôm excited to see him grow"
We also had two all rookie members last year and Killian Hayes has a lot of potential
France really gonna win gold in 2024 with da future GOAT Killian Hayes
"I'm super high on Killian Hayes. Obviously his rookie year didn't go as planned due to the injury, but I think the dude has top level court vision to go along with solid defensive potential, a solid shooting stroke, high basketball IQ, and crafty scoring. It may take a couple years for it to all click for him but I think the dude is gonna be a stud. The Pistons are gonna have ball handling playmakers in spades with Cade and Killian paired with a very underrated player in Grant. Next year is probably too early for them, but I would not be surprised if they emerged as a dark horse playoff team 2 years from now √† la this year's Knicks."
"Vecenie is the only NBA draft guy I really respect. Everyone just follows the same groupthink, including KOC outside of a random hot take for clicks like Killian Hayes last year."
"Detroit is going to ruin Killian Hayes' development with 1st pick, isn't it?"
