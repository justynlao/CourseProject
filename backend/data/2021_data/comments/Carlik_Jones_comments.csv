"This is an aside from the question of having both, just a comparison of quality, but I think you're getting hate for your flair. Zion is a FAR FAR better prospect than Cade. Emoni is TBD, because Zion was just a ""good"" prospect until we saw him college, but college Zion had a once-in-a-generation season. Carlik Jones, a fifth-year grad transfer at Louisville, is putting up similar numbers to Cade. Cade is the best prospect in the draft but he isn't a generational talent."
"Smallest of the small samples, sure, but so far no one is quitting on mental health (Terry is a whole different issue) and pouting on camera, much the other way around. Can't remember a happier bench since Dirk was in unis, KP is as good as Bubble KP (in fact, even better on offense), Luka is happy, everyone is hustling hard, even some rookies out of nowhere are actually playing well (Omoruyi and Carlik Jones).  Kidd/Kokosov game plan is faster and more efficient. We still need to face a team with a classic physical C on rim duty to stress test, but so far we are doing really well. Fast pace, relying on the BBIQ of your players, pairing Luka and Brunson in a way better than what Rick used to.   I know r/nba is dying to see we tank to a 30-52 record because Kidd is baddy man, but so far he showed literally nothing other than good offensive schemes, tough defense and player development."
"Plus all of our rookies, Omoruyi, Hunt, Carlik Jones. They hit hard asf. There's really nothing but hard workers on the court, Nico Harrison did a stellar job."
"He is less known out of Mavs circle, but you really should add Carlik Jones there. A camp invite in the preseason that bailed tf out and earned a G-League invite.  Averaging 26.4/6.8/6.2 and 1.2 steals on 49/34/83 shooting. Can create for others off his own dribble and is one hell of an infiltrator and dribbler as a whole. If we do a 2 or 3-for-1 type of trade at the deadline, we will definitely be offering him a deal to play here for the 2nd half of the season."
&gt;Many experts are saying he goes in the lottery if they were to do a re-draft.  Who are these experts! And c'mon with these g-league stats lol. Undrafted Carlik Jones had 37 points for the Texas Legends last week.
