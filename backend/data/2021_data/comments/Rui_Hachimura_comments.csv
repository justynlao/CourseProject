Rui Hachimura and Yuta Watanabe are very much in the NBA lol
i love rui hachimura
"He was only the second best player in collage behind Zion with historic numbers. But people thought Rui Hachimura should be a higher pick. Made no sense, anybody watching them could see Clarke was way better."
"Irving travelled... but my main thought as I was watching was ""WTF is Beal doing"". He left Hachimura covering two guys under the basket... Rui did well getting back into the play.   Not sure if Beal was freestyling or a typical great Scott Brooks coaching move..."
"While there is definitely some of that, this sub loves to compare stuff to anime in general. Lots of memes based on generic anime stereotypes, reference to kuroko  no basket and the like. I do not disagree that its definitely more common with Rui hachimura and watanabe though."
"What is Rui Hachimura good at, exactly? Holy hell"
Rui Hachimura cannot shoot today
Wizards are just gonna give the ball to Beal and have him go off. Rui Hachimura jump shots and Russ doing weak post ups on Kyrie are gonna have them run out of the gym
Rui Hachimura. Too bad this man catches pink eye and COVID
"There is plenty of talent on the team. Just it’s been hurt or COVID-ed. Especially offensive talent.   Beal is a great talent.   Westbrook has been injured and is expensive, but he is still talented.   Bertans is one of the best shooters in the league. Covid  Lopez is a good backup C  Bryant is a good offensive C, but hurt   Rui Hachimura is a good prospect coming off a good rookie season. Covid  Avidja looks promising as a rook. Covid  Some okay role players.  Etc"
"Can’t pin these losses on Beal. Of course his numbers are going to be inflated if you’re missing Rui Hachimura, Troy Brown Jr, Thomas Bryant, Davis Bertans, Russell Westbrook and Ish Smith"
"Rui hachimura,thomas bryant, davis bertans, robin lopez       Amirite?"
"Yeah I agree the fit isn't great but if I'm the wizards I'm looking for a young guy that I can build around for the future. Ben, Rui Hachimura, Deni Advija and a lottery pick for this year is a great starting point Imo. Also I don't think Russ should be factored in because you most likely won't be contending (the most is probably a 7th seed) and after this and next season he probably walks"
I think there's only 2 Japanese players currently in the NBA:  1. Yuta Watanabe - Toronto Raptors  1. Rui Hachimura - Washington Wizards   I *think* those are also the only 2 Asian players.
"REALLLY sucks for Rui Hachimura too.  He's already garnered some fame in Japan, but the Olympics would have made him such a star."
"Best team here tbh.  PG: Raul Neto, Cassius Wintson, Westbrook   SG: Beal, Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga   SF: Avidja, Troy Brown Jr., Jerome Robinson   PF: Rui Hachimura , Davis Bertans,  Anthony Gill   C: Robin Lopez, Mo Wagner, Thomas Bryant"

"Except instead of Davis Bertans and Rui Hachimura being your 2nd and 3rd options, it's Harden and Kyrie"
"Yeah Beal really should have taken his team to the playoffs witj Davis Bertans....uh...a rookie Rui Hachimura...and uh, Troy Brown Jr and Thomas Bryant."
"It is a bit cringy.  At least it's not as bad as when the annoucers say ""Konnichiwa!"" when Rui Hachimura makes a play."
"That's not the point, back in the days he was a ""great when he tries, meh overall"" defender and his teams could leave with it because he played with great defenders, now he's mostly a ""meh the one possession per game he tries, horrendous overall"" and he no longer plays with Paul George, Roberson and Steven Adams but with Thomas Bryant, Ish Smith and Rui Hachimura."
"I think you just made up a nickname for Rui Hachimura!  Better inform Shaq, the true NBA declarer of nicknames!"
"I was being sarcastic, you also realize that announcers yell ""Konichiwa"" anytime Rui Hachimura does anything right?"
"is it racist when the announcers say ""Konnichiwa"" when Rui Hachimura makes a play"

"They were playing the 1-5 Wizards. The same Wizards that had sophomore Rui Hachimura guarding Durant and Thomas ""2nd worst defensive center in the league"" Bryant."
The Nets really need to improve on the boards. Let us get away with a lot of bad looks. Rui Hachimura played amazing tonight.   I'm ready to have my heart broken by this team.
"nah man, beating defensive juggernaut Rui Hachimura on the all time worst defensive team makes him just as good when he was the 2x FMVP, scoring champ, MVP, consensus top 2 player of his era..."
"It wasn't a good defense but Hachimura didn't give up, instead he tried too hard to keep up with KD.  You can see it better in the slow-motion replay. After his second crossover, KD does a hesitation fake at the free throw line and Hachimura, already unbalanced, moves his body slightly forward to stay with the jump shot and Durant just goes by. It's not a lack of effort on Hachimura's part, he was just doing twister on the spot.    Ironically if Hachimura actually gave up early and stayed back, letting KD take the midrange jump shot, it might've been a better play in terms of percentage even with KD being one of the best shooters. But Rui probably was expecting some rotation help."
"Rui ""Kawaii Leonard"" Hachimura"
I cant tell if this is Rui Hachimura to Thomas Bryant or what XD
"I dont watch many Wizards games are their commentators good? I was getting annoyed because the one guy kept saying ""konichiwa"" everytime Rui Hachimura did something good like we get it hes japanese"
"Honestly surprised racism against Asians is actually getting looked at.   While we’re at it, can announcers stop yelling “KONICHIWA” everytime Rui Hachimura breathes on a basketball court?"
"Stanley Johnson, Jaylen Brown, Josh Jackson, Mikal Bridges, Rui Hachimura, DeAndre Hunter, Patrick Williams, Issac Okoro"
"Rui Hachimura is on his way.  He’a always had all the tools and the work ethic, seems to be coming together right now."
"We were hurt by injuries at the beginning of year  - Westbrook playing injured  - Hachimura out with Pink Eye / Bertans out of shape and on minutes restriction.   Then we started turning it around a bit  - Thomas Bryant tore his ACL  - 75% of the team were out due to covid + didn't basketball for 2 weeks  - So lost like 4 games due to players being out ... and then the next couple games they were back .. still weren't in rhythm ( probably due to not playing any for 2 weeks).  Finally got some good continuity and turned it into a win streak.  - Better defense from the team in general ( Rui really stepped up )  - Moving Garrison Matthews / Mo Wagner to the starting line up provided some more energy and shooting to the starting line up. Also moved Lopez/Advija to the bench .. where they played better.  - Ish Smith being injured, meaning Brooks couldn't sabatoge with 3 PG lineups."
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9. Keldon Johnson (#29)   Other players that outperformed their picks include Brandon Clarke (#21), Grant Williams (#22) and Kendrick Nunn (undrafted).  Players that dropped out of my top 10: Darius Garland, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, but all of them would probably be in the 11-20 range"

"Unrelated but I didn't know Rui Hachimura was black until he came back from injury his rookie year.  But I can kind of understand how people can get angry a lil too quick. Honestly it hurts to see someone else being able to embrace things that I myself can't. Since kenyon got called ""yellow boy"" a.k.a lightskin and had to deal with not being black enough, it probably hurt to see someone else being respected for wearing cornrows when he's not black.   That's where my hurt from cultural appropriation comes from. Others that are able to profit off of the same traits that were/are used to mock my people. The feeling won't go away, you have to learn to just deal with it."

100%. We don't have a decent big. The closest thing to that is Rui Hachimura and he's a wing.   I mean we have Rolo but c'mon
"I think that’s only true of both the best and most disciplined defenders *and* I don’t think leaving any NBA player “open” is a real viable strategy. I mentioned it in a previous comment but Dort obviously isn’t a shooter and he hurt them in the first round last year iirc.  You mention drop coverage but I don’t think I made it clear the PnR is happening around midrange/FT line, drop coverage would essentially give him a floater. I think teams often start playing the way you described (happy to concede the midrange) at the beginning of games and dependent on his shooting outcomes adjust whether they mean too or not.   For me it’s necessary to open up his game/floor on a bad team (which the Wizards currently are) and the positives for the Wizards offense outweigh the difference in value gained by having someone else take those shots.   Which is a whole other thing people never consider when it comes to efficiency. Efficiency is a long term metric that’s highly volatile in the short term. The difference beteeen a 35% three point shooter career and a 38% three point shooter career is minuscule over the course of any single game (dependent to difficult of shots/type of shots/attempts/etc I’m just qualifying this). I don’t get exactly who people expect Russ to give the ball to, to take these shots and not only produce as efficiently if not more so than he is. The Wizards have been terrible outside of Beal/WB. Rui hasn’t had the leap I expected (but he was injured/Covid iirc) and with Thomas Bryant out they’re playing fucking Robin Lopez at center. I don’t think the difference in the shots he’d be giving up is so great it would warrant criticism and would also require taking the ball out of his hands sometimes.   I’m not saying it’s not the best option for defenses, I’m saying it’s necessary for WB game given the roster construction and honestly with the rest of their surrounding talent I’m not sure what the expected answer is. This would be way different if Bertans was shooting like he did last year and Hachimura made a small leap, but I don’t think the options aren’t him even warrant the discussion at the moment."
"Their third best player is young Rui Hachimura, they have no center, their bench plays no D, their coach is terrible."
"Rui Hachimura and Bradley Beal WILL play. Fuck it, play-in time?"
Rui hachimura.
Yeah he's basically the rui hachimura for the philippines. I hope Kai Soto gets good
"Without looking at Google or the comments, can you name which player came from where?  #Wizards  * Rui Hachimura * Deni Avdija * Davis Bertans  * Robin Lopez * Raul Neto * Issac Bonga * Alex Len  #Mavs  * Luka Doncic * Tingus Pingus * Boban * Maxi Kleber * Willie Cauley-Stien * Dwight Powell * Nicolo Melli * Josh Green"
Rui Hachimura
"As time grows my admiration for Kyle and D wade grows. I’ll never forget after the Russell Westbrook incident with the racist fan out guys sat and had a conversation about this kind of stuff. And shortly after korver released his players tribune article about white privilege. And then a few years later after George Floyd Donovan wrote a wonderful piece on his experience with racial inequality. With the MLB news today about the all star game in Atlanta I saw a lot of people say “keep politics out of sports” again. And it makes me sad because I’ve personally learned a lot listening to these athletes talk about their experiences. I’d love to hear about Jeremy Lin, or rui hachimura experiences as Asian nba players since there’s been so few of them and they’d probably share a really unique perspective"
"Don't know why, but I'm happy for you. I love Rui Hachimura too, I was obsessed with buying his rookie cards lol."

"I think a lot of it is genuinely a lack of talent. Russ, Beal, and now we’re finding out Rui Hachimura are the only ones who can genuinely contribute meaningful minutes on another team. Someone like Jerome Robinson is starting for the Wizards right now but his next contract will probably be in China. It’s not exactly that the Wizards have an inability to get open looks, it’s that most of the team just doesn’t have the talent to hit them. I’m not a Brooks apologist but the Wizards’ problems go deeper than him."

They probably thought the black bloke on the picture named Rui Hachimura is an editing error.
"I live in Japan and play basketball here. In sports shops, I have only seen Hachimura jerseys (although I haven’t been to the shop in the last few months, so maybe that has changed). The guys I play ball with seem to be bigger fans of the main stars in the NBA, I haven’t heard them talking about Yuta, and just heard a little of them talking about Rui. That’s my 2¥."
"I hate how random users always spout some bullshit line about what certain players feel or experience without any evidence. You could literally ask Rui Hachimura if he felt he was being discriminated against right now, and even if he said no, reddit ""saviours"" would still say well actually so and so Japan is racist, so yes."
NBA is very popular in Japan. Yuta was our original NBA dream tho. Rui is more famous as japanese in america because of his high draft pick but Yuta in highschool/college was legendary for us Japanese. He had a rough go as an NBA player so far and now that hes seemed to found a home/playing time it is an incredible feel good story for us Japanese.  Not to say Hachimura is not popular but not as feel good of a story this year
Rui-N Hachimura
"Lakers, Warriors and Bulls. (In no specific order)  Lakers are popular worldwide, Warriors have Curry and Bulls had Jordan.   Outside of Canada, Raptors don’t have much in the way of international fans.  Raptors and Wizards have fans in Japan thanks to Rui Hachimura and Yuta Watanabe, but basketball doesn’t have the same level of popularity there as it does in some other countries. (I.e, China)  Can’t really speak for the other listed teams."

Yeah it's wild that Japanese fan favor him over Rui Hachimura
"So, konichiwa bitches — Rui Hachimura is here to collect souls."
Have I introduced you to a healthy Rui Hachimura
rui hachimura was the first wizards player not named russell westbrook or bradley beal to score in double digits at 3:57 in the 4th  my god
It’s one thing if you’re a visitor and the locals know you won’t be there for a long time.  The gaijin label doesn’t apply until you’re trying to be part of everyday life like Hachimura is.  Rui and Osaka will never be considered Japanese by half of the country despite growing up and being fluent in the language and customs.  You never received the same hostility as them because you didn’t dare trample on Japans “cultural purity” like they tried to do by existing in everyday Japanese life.
A friend of mine told me Yuta Watanabe was more popular in Japan than Rui Hachimura because he's considered to be real Japanese. Even though Rui is a better player.
"Not necessarily in the league, but very few non-wizards fans seem to know much about Rui Hachimura. He has a bright future ahead of him."
"Absolutely no one in this game played any defense whatsoever. Which, to be fair, made it very entertaining to watch as a neutral fan.  I concentrated a bit on Hachimura because I wanted to see if his defense had improved but if that's the case, this game did not showcase it… Part of the reason could be that he was super active on offense and was too gassed for defense. Before the season, I thought one of the main offensive problems for the Wizards besides the 3pt shooting was athleticism and vertical spacing. Rui had so many drives, cuts and alley oops this game; if he can bring that consistently, the Wizards have a problem less. (Gafford also helps tremendously in this area.) He still needs to be a lot less timid from 3 though.  Other than that, absolutely beautiful game from Westbrook. There's this nice loop where this team just pushes themselves: When his teammates run and cut, Russ ""rewards"" them with assists. That makes them run even more which in turn makes Russ pass even more. The equally desirable byproduct is: Westbrook only takes 8 shots the whole game.  So yeah, the Wiz are on an absolute tear at the moment. I'm still not a fan of the Westbrook-Neto-Beal lineup and I'd argue you could sacrifice Neto's offense for some much needed defense. But even as a notorious Bonga demander, I have to say my argument is becoming weaker and weaker with each win."

Put some respect on Rui Hachimura
"Team “JM”:  Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Jalen McDaniels, Jaden McDaniels, JaVale McGee  Team “RH”:  R.J. Hampton, Rodney Hood, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Rui Hachimura, Richaun Holmes    Team “JC”: Jevon Carter, Jordan Clarkson, Jarrett Culver, Jae Crowder, John Collins   Team “LD”:  Luka Doncic, Lu Dort, no other players needed."
"Yes, many teams nowadays don't even start a 7 footer and if they do, he plays low minutes, Russ's own team does this with Alex Len.  Len plays 15 minutes a game and is their ""starting center"", but most of the time the tallest guy on the court for the Wizards is 6-8 Rui Hachimura. Even in OKC when that wasn't the case, Steven Adams didn't focus as much on defensive rebounding as big mens traditionally do and you can see that by his very low defensive rebounding averages in that span for a guy his size.  With that said, Russ is probably the only player in NBA history that can do what he's been doing, maybe the Big O could do the same in today's game, but it's almost impossible to predict what a guy that played 60 years ago could do now. Neither could average a triple double in the 90s and early 2000s though."
RUI “GORO” HACHIMURA LIVE NEAR YOUR FACE
"get ray hudson gargle noises into basketball.  *Rui Hachimura, you could drop a tarantula into his shorts and he'll still be cool.*"
# breaking news !! Rui hachimura murdered anthony Davis!
Rui Hachimura
"Rui, too.. I think Rui Hachimura is becoming a nice player."
"I think he has; how many guys taken after Garland would you take over him? The only ones with a case are Coby White, Rui Hachimura, Cam Johnson, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro, Chuma Okeke, Nickeil Alexander Walker, Matisse Thybulle, Brandon Clarke, and Lu Dort. I'd personally take Garland over all those guys except maybe Dort."
"Russ and Beal are the least of their problems? Russ and Beal are the primary reasons why they can’t guard anyone. Russ and Beal are also a part of their poor shooting from three. Your acting as if they’re this separate, efficient entity that is being held down by poor teammates.   Hachimura will be just a decent starter? At this rate, playing alongside these two, sure. But he’s shown flashes of being a highly impactful player. The Wizards may not be rebuilding but they are bad. They are lottery-bound. What difference does it make in regards to prioritizing Rui?"
"Okay, so Rui Hachimura having the ball more in playmaking positions, earlier in the shot clock would lead Washington to more wins than Russ and Beal? If you actually think that's the case, not only you have not watched Wizards games, but you have no idea of what the hell you are talking about.  By the way, just because you've mentioned, the Wizards are 3-6 when Hachimura attempts 15+ FGA and 10-9 when he attempts less than 10 FGA."
Yes Rui Hachimura being the primary ball handler will lead washington to more wins then russ and beal being the ball handlers
"Okay, and Wizards fans get to feel good about watching this “absolute legend” in a wasted season. Meanwhile, Rui Hachimura, the Wizards’ only young talent, is playing third fiddle to two high usage guards.   Didn’t even touch the ball in OT yesterday. Never gets an opportunity to create plays for himself and the team. But who cares, right? We’re all here to watch the Westbrook-Beal show enthuse fans but go absolutely nowhere. As if there’s not ample evidence that a Westbrook dominated team does nothing for your franchise except put butts in seats. Except, there’s no fans! So why do this? Rui is really, really good! Why not put the ball in his hands? Why relegate him to the run-of-the-mill PF who either shoots mid-rangers or dives to the rim? Why are there multiple games where he has single digit shot attempts? Why? Why? So we can all Westbrook triple-double watch? So Beal can win the scoring title? These priorities are absolutely idiotic."
"Oh yeah, Rui Hachimura and Patrick WIlliams are next! Both much better than Jackson tho"
"Honestly not too bad. He's only had one full offseason and season with the job so far.   In that time, the biggest trade was obviously the Wall-Westbrook trade which was a W for Washington. I think though that trade was a product of circumstance, John butting heads with our FO and WB wanting out of Houston was just a perfect storm. Either way good for us.  The trade to pick up Gafford from the Bulls mid season also seems like it's a pretty big W for Washington.  As for drafting, he's drafted Rui Hachimura and Deni Avdija. Rui is already a pretty solid player but has a lot of room to improve, and we didn't really get to see how good Deni can be because of how Brooks used him in his system and his injury. Overall though, I am pretty happy with these picks."
RUI HACHIMURA SEASON
Yo what about an all Asian team  Rui Hachimura Yuta Watanabe Kyle Anderson Jordan Clarkson Jeremy Lin
"a team with Westbrook probably at the end of his peak, with Beal at his peak, with a developing Rui Hachimura and even Deni Avdjia...and this god damn below mediocre of a coach? Wtf.   Fucking why?!"
He is well known to us Wizards fans. But not well known to most nba fans. Rui Hachimura
Kawhi is not Japanese but Rui Hachimura is
"After seeing in the comments that a lot of people didn't know that Clarkson is pinoy, I'm curious if anyone knows of any other part-asians. I know that Allonzo Trier is half Korean and Rui Hachimura is half japanese. Are there any other active players who are part-asian?  I just think the NBA might be missing out on an opportunity to do an Asian Heritage week or month and show that Jeremy Lin isn't the only asian in the league and definitely not the FIRST asian american to play in the league.  A big chunk of immigrant and older generation Asians dont really accept part-asians as one of them, so I can see why players might keep their asian heritage under the radar. I've heard some nasty things that full asians have said about asians with mixed heritage. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVR3B01NxiM) is a light-hearted example of how the judgment goes, but make sure you get to the end!"
"&gt;Westbrook, Bradley Beal, and Rui Hachimura are essentially off the table in trade talks, a source tells FortyEightMinutes.  Beal and Rui make perfect sense, but if somebody calls about Westbrook there is no way the Wizards hang up the phone without hearing an offer."
I think that players like Rui Hachimura benefit from playing with Westbrook.
"Rui Hachimura is a guy I could see getting better every year for 5 years straight. The best part of his game is creating his own shot in the midrange, which is something that lends itself more to being a superstar than a 3rd wheel"
"I don't think there are any sensible arguments that could be made for this year's teams being better without those players that are injured. In this day and age I think the most likely scenario would be an iso-heavy, defensively-deficient star missing lots of time. The result there would be the offense moving to a more ball-movement-oriented style, with the team defense improving without that liability on the court. I don't think that anybody fits that mold this year, closest I could think would be if Westbrook had gotten injured and the Wizards somehow managed to beat the Sixers led by Beal, Ish Smith, and Rui Hachimura"
MPJ can compete for the Rui Hachimura crown of the 6'9+ player playing defense like he's 5'9
"Going from being guarded by Brown, Tatum and Smart to Rui Hachimura (never seen a guy be so bad at getting over screens) and small guards will do that to someone"
Man Rui Hachimura is something special. At times it looked like he couldn’t miss.
Rui Hachimura will defeat racism. You heard it here first folks.
Rui Hachimura とても愛らしいです

Were you watching the game? Russ was 3-19. An inability to stop Russ and Beal was not the problem. Neither of them played well and you still lost. The problem is without Embiid you aren't that good. You were getting carried by role players and got beaten by Rui Hachimura and Robin Lopez.
The Rui Hachimura Game
I love Rui Hachimura. That's it. That's the comment.
RUI HACHIMURA WITH THE DAGGER!
Somehow Rui Hachimura is now The Rock
Dude Rui Hachimura looks like a Japanese Giannis
Hows Rui Hachimura been looking?
Just because his name is Rui Hachimura doesn't mean he's a hashira named Rengoku... Gotta run when a Twelve Kizuki is bearing down on you....
"Wizards need some help fleshing out that roster. That’s a really great backcourt they’ve got, but when the best member of your supporting cast is a very young and inexperienced Rui Hachimura, it doesn’t bode well for your team’s chances.  Think with Thomas Bryant coming back next season hopefully fully recovered, and if they can somehow snag a decent prospect outside of the lottery, they could be better set for the future."
Wizards!!! Rui Hachimura is a dunk god and Russell Westbrook has some violent ones too
"That Wizards is like the perfect match up for him and Harris to get confidence, the only wing sized guy that plays a lot is has never gotten over a screen in his entire career (Hachimura), and since they start 3 small guard the one that's not guarded by Rui has a huge size advantage.  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly that Wiz team might be the weakest team at the wing position to make the playoffs in years"

"Truth be told, we can talk about Brooks (he's bad), Russ (he's been bad this playoffs), but we are in 2021 and one team is in the playoffs with Rui Hachimura and Chandler Hutchison as the only players between 6'3 and 6'8 in their rotation, not sure what you can expect with that, especially because it's not like those 2 are any good either"
"Fake fan not having Swish Smith top 5 smh  Actual ranking:  1) Swish Smith  2) Robin Abdul-Jabbar  3) Daniel Goatford  4) Real Deal Beal  5) Rui ""The Slamurai"" Hachimura"
1.	Robin Lopez 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Raul Neto 4.	Daniel Gafford 5.	Rui Hachimura
"6'5"" Matisse Thybulle just blocked 6'8"" Rui Hachimura on a step back jumper"
Hachimura needs more shots lol Like half the shots of russ should go to rui. That guy might be beals sidekick in the future might aswell develop him properly
"Reminds me of Rui ""You Know"" Hachimura"
Extremely disrespectful to Rui Hachimura.
Rui Hachimura looks more like Giannis than any of his brothers do.
6 between Wilt Chamberlain and Rui Hachimura
Full season of Rui Hachimura with a competent coach... the possibilities are endless
I don’t understand how no one has said Rui Hachimura
He would be great friends with Rui Hachimura
"&gt;Rui Hachimura, the primary Jayson Tatum defender and one of the only players who can guard Tatum, picked up 3 fouls within the first 6 minutes of the game.  Rui got his third foul with 4 minutes left in the first half.  Very hard to tell without replays, but the [first one](https://streamable.com/49719e) could have gone either way, the [second one](https://streamable.com/nq7ss2) looked soft (but hard to know given the angle), and the [third one](https://streamable.com/wje5b4) was a boneheaded take foul for a guy who was already in foul trouble."
"Visit Dongbei real quick and everybody there is 6'4 easily. Chinese people not making the NBA is for a geopolitical reason only. Why pull in better players like Guo Ailun or Ding YangYuHang when you have Yuta Watanabe? It's just political. Why develop Zhou Qi when you could develop Aleksej Poku? Why develop WangZheLin when you could develop Rui Hachimura? Why spend money and marketing having a Chinese face on your american team when the system is currently trying to push yellow peril ? Why develop Abadushalmu Abudurexiti when you could have Deni Avdija? There are CBA young studs like Kevin Zhang and Fanbo Zeng that could make it here too.   What do i mean political? The idea is that making the NBA is also part luck. With 30 teams, 13 roster slots, you can only put so many people on your team. You have to give somebody a chance, bc one roster spot has 1000 hopeful people trying to get on. Not only are you vying for that super competitive spot, if you also come from the country that they don't really like and have beef with, they're not gonna ""help you out"" and give you that opportunity."
Foul trouble made Rui Hachimura basically nonexistent for most that game. 3-21 from 3pt is astoundingly bad; having Beal and Westbrook take turns trying to jack as many shots as possible is not a good game plan.  A lot of people had already convinced themselves of Westbrook vs Durant &amp; Harden was guaranteed in the 1st round.
"gg love Rui Hachimura and Beal. I was glad you guys got him, hope he takes the next step!"
Marv can bring up these facts about Rui Hachimura up but can't figure out that Nesmith and Smart are different people
Risking Rui Hachimura might be the move to make before this gets away. He is their only wing player
Rui “Kawaii Leonard” Hachimura
"Rui Hachimura, why can't you take the 2s to google it lol. And he's Japanese, not Asian American."
Shouldn't we care though? The NBA loves preaching when it comes to racial issues yet was silent with Jeremy Lin and commentators using basic stereotypes every time Rui Hachimura scores. The NBA and it's players are being hypocritical and isn't it our job as fans to call them out on it?
"**Most games as top scorer - best on team**  1. Stephen Curry - 52 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo - 50 3. Luka Doncic - 49  **Most games as top scorer - second best on team**  1.

I think rui hachimura will be a 20ppg+ scorer next year. He’s steadily improved over the seasons and showed flashes of being elite
I AM COPPING A RUI HACHIMURA JERSEY.
"Yes. He has the worst rotations of any coach. Beal has been out with injury and in the last game vs the Hawks Brooks pulled Rui Hachimura (the 3rd best player on the team) for the final 6 minutes while the team gave up a 19-9 run. He also refused to play our best center, Daniel Gafford, in favor of playing Alex Len during that run. (and that's a regular thing)  He doesn't coach an offense, and his defense only got better after we added Daniel Gafford (who again, he refuses to play regular minutes). He doesn't hold players like Russ accountable, but he'll bench a guy for multiple games in a row if he thinks he fouled too much or something. (Garrison Matthews needs more playing time, especially without Beal)"
Rui Hachimura or cam reddish are my picks
The beat Belgium less than a week ago as well and Hungary earlier in these friendlies.  https://www.bulletsforever.com/2021/7/17/22581463/japan-vs-belgium-final-score-mens-basketball-rui-hachimura
"When hachimura and watanabe are playing they are undefeated against asian teams. Japan was the first asian country to beat australia\`s mens basketball team ( it\`s australia\`s team B but still they had delly, maker, goulding and sobey in the line up ) when hachimura first played for japan\`s senior team. Watanabe later joined rui and they defeated iran twice even though it was an impossible task for japan basketball team before."
"Ramen?? Is that a Rui Hachimura reference??  -r/nba after commenting ""Konichiwa!!"" every single time he does something"
There's also the part where the whole song is talking about how it's a Toyama thing so they need a Toyama star (Rui Hachimura) to advertise it for them.
"Damn, the truce with Godzilla must have saved Millions of lives. Thank You, Rui Hachimura."
"*A dashi will come out*   *Hime noboshi curry*   *A dashi will come out*   *Toyama noboshi will come out*  *A star of Toyama who comes to mind?*  *Of course it's Hachimura Rui*  *What's Hachimura's favorite food?*  *Just as we thought it's hime curry.*  *It's Toyama's gourmet B class.*  *The flavor of niboshi works.*  *\[Interlude\]*  *Hime curry is not well known*  *Only people from Toyama know about it.*  *So if it doesn't sell we'll be in trouble.*  *Therefore we'll ride on Hachimura's popularity*   *\[interlude\]  one village (ichimura), two village, three village, ... , eight village (hachimuri)*  *Toyama Black (garlic) ramen is also good but,*  *Hime udon is also good but,*  *This and that hime curry.*  *Rui: Because it's probably good, buy some won't you.*"
Rui Hachimura has entered the chat
France- Rudy gobert  Argentina - Facundo Campazzo  Japan - Rui Hachimura  Ausie - patty Mills  Italy - Danilo Gallinari  Spain - gasol brothers    I just named 1 player for most of the team. Iran don't have a nba player so we can expect them to get blown out.
"I'm hoping the Wizards will. They'll be getting their starting center Thomas Bryant back who put up solid numbers before his acl injury and Rui Hachimura could be on track for a breakout season, and of course they have a great backcourt with Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal leading the way"
Rui Hachimura breaks out. Probably Sabonis falls off
Breakout: Rui Hachimura Fall off: Jerami Grant
Rui Hachimura for breakout  Jimmy Butler for fall off (underwhelm/let Bam or Herro take the reigns)
Yup Rui Hachimura had a poster a few months ago on AD where he fire shoved the fuck outta him lol. But it was a nice poster so the refs let it slide.
"Recent History shows the 9th pick as a real mixed bag, for what's its worth, all these players are still playing today (Vonleh might not last past this season). Only 3 of them were basically back ups from the start.  2010: Gordon Hayward (Utah, signed an extension) 15.6/4.5/3.5, made an all star game; 685 games played  2011: Kemba Walker (Charlotte, signed an extension) 19.9/3.8/5.4, multiple all star games, an all nba team; 704 games played  2012: Andre Drummond (Pistons, signed an extension) 14.5/13.7/1.4, all star, all nba, rebounding leader; 645 games played  2013: Trey Burke - starter, then quickly role player  2014: Noah Vonleh - role player, now third stringer  2015: Frank Kaminsky - role player  2016: Jakob Poetl - role player, current starter (usually)  2017: Dennis Smith Jr - starter, now role player  2018: Kevin Knox - role player  2019: Rui Hachimura - starter  2020: Deni Advija - role player"
You haven't seen Olympics Rui Hachimura yet
Rui Hachimura
Konichiwa! Rui Hachimura!
"Super duper homer answer: Rui Hachimura  I think with the right coach, he has Kawhi upside with potentially a better 3 pt shot (but I don’t see his defense ever taking the jump to Kawhi’s level)"
&gt;Trash can: Rui Hachimura  The absolute size of this L
Japan have 2 NBA players in Rui Hachimura and Yuta Watanabe.
Rui Hachimura?
"They made it as hosts, but they've gotten a bit better, too. Rui Hachimura and Yuta Watanabe are solid, and former Nevada legend Nick Fazekas has played well for them in the past, too"
"At the time, it was Trae Young + a No. 1 pick for Luka Doncic. Depending on where the balls fell, that could have been Rui Hachimura or Darius Garland. The Mavs pick really dropped during the lottery, so all things considered, the Hawks did well, but not nearly as well as they could have got for that haul."
"Japan basketball has historically been pretty trash and honestly still doesn't really deserve a spot, but I'm pretty excited to see them this year. This is definitely the best Japanese basketball roster ever. Rui Hachimura and Yuta Watanabe are genuinely GOOD NBA players who might be able to carry them past another Olympic squad a couple times.   And the top players (MVP level guys) from the Japanese league aren't TOTAL scrubs anymore. Makoto Hiejima, Yudai Baba, and Yuki Togashi have all spent time in either the NBA Summer League or G league. There are a couple other guys who look pretty decent too. Kosuke Kanamaru is an absolute sharpshooter, averaging over 40% from 3 and 90% from the free throw line in multiple seasons in Japan.   Japan is certainly nowhere near the European or American powerhouse countries. But I can see them getting a couple wins, especially against some of the weaker teams who have qualified for the Olympics, like Nigeria or Iran. As a Wizards fan, I hope Rui carries them far."
That would be Rui Hachimura
"The best Asian player is probably Rui Hachimura, which should tell you a lot about their respective national teams"
"There’s definitely a racial component no matter how you slice it. Another explanation is that a lot of the **universally** beloved players are foreign which, for some reason, makes them endearing to Americans. Look at Tacko, Luka, Boban, Patty Mills, Rui Hachimura, and Steven Adams."
"1. Usage - players that play more and make more explosive movements are more likely to get hurt 2. Exposure - you're more likely to hear about a star player getting hurt, even if it happens at the same rate as role players  For the Wizards, people talked about Russ getting healthy all season, while ignoring that we had lost Thomas Bryant, Deni Avdija, and (for stretches) Rui Hachimura"
I personally love him but probanly rui hachimura
Rui Hachimura
"Rui Hachimura. Avg 13-14 pts per game and improved his 3pt shooting this year. FT shooting around 80%, so hopefully he can continue to improve his shot and become a borderline all-star 3 and D guy. He’ll be fun to watch in the olympics as the main focus of his team."
"I mean but per minute, per shot, whatever you wanna say, he’s not someone you would describe as a 3pt shooter. He took 3’s at about the same rate as Brad Wanamaker and Rui Hachimura"
"Rui hachimura curry shooting, draymonds defense"
Team USA is shaping up to be great. Hopefully we'll see Japan vs. the United States to get some Beal vs. Rui Hachimura action.
"No it wouldn't. They are a deep team. Capela is a great center that is a lob threat and good defender. Collins is a 4 that can shoot from outside and score inside. Bogdan is a versatile combo guard. Gallinari is one of the better bench players in the league and can shoot from anywhere with basically anyone guarding him. Huerter, Reddish, and Hunter all all decently good young players. Plus they picked up Lou Williams who can be useful in certain matchups.  The wizards third best player is probably Rui Hachimura or Davis Bertans. After them, their roster gets bad real quick. They're so bad that Daniel Gafford, a dude they basically picked up for free was a big game changer for them."
Rui Hachimura is the 2k cover athlete in Japan so I'm picking him.

"MVP: Curry  I can't see the Mavs having a top 3 seed this season unfortunately. I think Warriors have a good shot at it with Murray/Kawhi expected to miss a significant amount of time. Lakers may take a bit to gel and Lebron should be on full coast imo. We say how brilliant Curry was at the end of last season and he could get it this season. Embiid, Giannis, and Brooklyn are the biggest competitors imo. Luka, Jokic, and Trae have an outside shot.  DPOY: Anthony Davis  I'm not the biggest fan of AD, but his defense in 2020 was amazing. Draymond talked about one guy whose never out of shape that was - and we all think it was Davis. He's one of the most switchable players in the league. And a clear top 5 defender.He had an off year last year that i think will help build a narrative for voters. Draymond is polarizing, Gobert won too much, and Simmons is the go-to hate guy for the media. As much as i believe Dray may deserve it, this award is going to come down to AD vs. Giannis.  6MOY: Derrick Rose  Thibs trusts his guy. D Rose is gonna have his role in the offense, and I dont see Kemba being a huge threat to his minutes. Rose is going to keep his 25 minutes, and he's trusted with the ball in his hands. I dont think Clarkson will have the same season as last as his efficiency started to return to the old clarkson at the end. People aren't huge on impact guys like Ingles for 6MOY so I think Rose will take it.   ROY: Jalen Green  He's going to score more than any other rookie, and from everything we have seen, Green already has a level of efficiency to his game. I think Cade is less of a go get his and neither guy will be on a good team. Green's stats are going to jump out a bit more imo. Playing next to Hayes, Cade won't have a high enough assist total to make up for it.   MIP: Rui Hachimura  You never really know who is going to win MIP before the season. MPJ already had great counting stats and most of the improvement he needs to make is outside the stat sheet (defense, shot selection, smarter basketball). Hachimura will have much more of a scoring role without Westbrook there, and he showed some insane potential in the olympics. His outside shot is developing well, and I see a breakout year for him.  COTY: Erik Spoelstra  Exec: Bulls"
1. Westbrook and Harden are the Bryce Harper of the NBA.  2. Rui Hachimura is a future star.  3. Modern NBA is overhyped trash.  4. Durant and Leonard will be rated better to.mr compared to LeBron as they are amazing defenders.  5. Durant should have won defensive player of the year 5 years ago.
"Terance Mann, Nickeil Walker-Alexander, Rui Hachimura (he’s gonna be amazing tbh), De’Andre Hunter, Lonnie Walker, Cole Anthony, Patrick Williams, And Jaren Jackson Jr (I already think he’s good but he’s going to put people on notice)."
Rui Hachimura and Lauri Markkanen (if he ever ends up signing anywhere)
Rui Hachimura looked awesome in the Olympics.
I hate how Rui Hachimura is constantly out of these talks
Rui Hachimura to win MIP. You heard it here first.  As for someone from another team? Matisse Thybulle to win DPOY.
Rui Hachimura
"damn I feel really bad. I was utterly confused and had to read the OP’s headline a few times to realize this was, in fact, not Rui Hachimura.   I blame work for distracting me and my horrible reading comprehension skills.."
i am pretty sure rui hachimura was a pitcher at first before basketball
Rui Hachimura is a good bet and he isnt even on the list
"Don’t want to assume, but what Asian country are you from? Me personally, in your shoes, I’d choose a player from that country if there is one, even a bench guy. I remember meeting this dude from Lithuania, and the pride and vibe of just loving Jonas Valuncuinas was super cool. Jonas is a good player but not one that would come immediately to mind by any means for American NBA fans.   So just for example, if you were based in Japan, Rui Hachimura is a promising young player on the Wizards, who aren’t great but look like they’ll be a young team that’s fun to watch. Just my opinion though!"
rui hachimura and deni avdija for kevin durant and kyrie irving and jim harden. who says no?
"&gt; In other words, they wanted 2019 first-round pick Rui Hachimura or 2020 first-rounder Deni Avdija, a request that inspired a swift “no” in response from the Wizards.  Oof. Well, can't blame a team for shooting their shot."
"Okay so if you're going to move the goalposts from ""create for themselves"" to ""has offensive value"", then I could tell you about how Rui Hachimura and Robin Lopez are serviceable offensive players that are effective scorers on the inside, and how much shooting the Rockets had with guys like Tucker, Gordon and Green spotting up."
I stopped reading the headline after I saw Rui as I assumed it was referring to Hachimura and was very confused to see women playing.
"Damn I read that as Rui Hachimura, turned out it was women's basketball."
This is not meant to be disrespectful in any way but I read the title quickly and thought it said Rui Hachimura and I didn’t realize till halfway through that this wasn’t the men’s team
Read this as Rui hachimura initially and was very confused to say the least
LMAO bruh I didn't even notice  Deadass thought OP misspelt Rui Hachimura in the title 💀
"I was never a fan of this stat. The common thread on all those teams: if it's not Westbrook + KD/PG/Beal scoring, who else is gonna get it done?   The third option on those teams in respective order: Ibaka, Schroder, Thomas Bryant / Rui Hachimura (when Bryant got injured)."
"&gt;Lot of star power  &gt;Melo, Gasol and Dwight  Melo last year 13ppg on 55% TS (Rui Hachimura also had 13ppg on 55% TS last year. Star power)  Gasol last year 5ppg  Dwight last year 7ppg"
Rui Hachimura is an all-star? Cmon bruh.
Rui Hachimura should probably be a Superstar other than that we're good.
"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
I mean this is an NBA forum right?  If I brought up trading for Rui Hachimura I'm sure some Wizard fans would naturally chime in lol.
Rui Hachimura is gonna be a 20 ppg scorer with Russ gone. I’m not sure if the efficiency is gonna be great this year but I think it will be in a couple.
"Why would the Wizards even consider trading away Rui?? Dude's got tons of untapped potential and he really made strides last season...and I still think he'd be playing at even higher level if his balls weren't nearly destroyed during rookie season.  That said, if I'm TOR and Siakam's gone no matter what, Hachimura + a 1st would make my head turn twice..."
Rui Louis Hachimura in shambles
"If 13 PPG on 54% TS = complete inability to score, then Carmelo Anthony and Rui Hachimura can't score either  He's not a model of efficiency/consistency but him being completely incapable as a scorer hasn't been true since his rookie contract"
[Pascal Siakam Stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/siakapa01.html)  [Rui Hachimura Stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hachiru01.html)  Take the homer glasses off and tell me which one is better last year. Rui’s stats are basically the same from his rookie year.
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
Rui Hachimura and Bryant leading the Wizards to the ECF for the next 4 years
I thought that they had 2. But one is definitely Rui Hachimura.
Jalen Green a mix of Kelly Oubre and Rui Hachimura.
IT'S BECAUSE YOU NEED TO SHOOT BASKETS TO GET POINTS. BEAL COULD ONLY TAKE SO MANY SHOTS AND MY BOIS RUI HACHIMURA AND DENI AVDIJA AREN'T PRIMED TO TAKE OVER THE LEAGUE JUST YET. WESTBROOK'S VOLUME WILL GO DOWN BUT SHOT PERCENTAGE WILL GO UP. AD AND LEBRON ARE GOING TO BE ON THREE POINT LINES LEAVING CLEAR LANES FOR RUSSELL TO HIT THE PAINT. OR IMAGINE AD OR LEBRON CUTTING TO THE RIM? IMAGINE WB CUTTING TO THE RIM FROM A LB PASS? LEAGUES DONE.
"Well, the move right now got them a draft pick, a 26 year old Kuzma on a lower cost $13M per for a couple more years, KCP the best piece a 3&amp;D making $13.5M for two more seasons, and Harrell on an expiring. I don’t think this trade alone moves the needle enough to make Beal re-sign. Bertans is now on the trade block, so let’s see how that unfolds. I bet they’re expecting a leap from Rui Hachimura, he’s good"
He got outscored by Rui Hachimura in the last game. Is Hachimura also an elite NBA player? lol
"He is well on his way to competing for that “best in NBA” title with giannis for many years, but him steamrolling some scrubs in international competition shouldn’t be the thing that makes you think he’s the best in the nba right now. like who is on japan? rui hachimura? who is on argentina? facundo campazzo?"
"of all the people whose nationality you question, you question the guy literally named rui hachimura instead of Gavin Earl Edwards?"
Rui Hachimura cant cream these cats?
"Rui Hachimura kann diese Katzen nicht schlagen.    Danke, Google Übersetzer 👍👍"
"Rui Hachimura s temi mačkami ne more zmagati.   Thank you, google translate. :)"
Lukas nice but he’s no Rui Hachimura
"I hope Rui Hachimura keeps getting better, he’s fun to watch"
I wonder how athletically talented the offspring of Rui Hachimura and Naomi Osaka would be.
bro his name is rui hachimura haha
Rui Hachimura is... Japanese...?
"I think nowadays the term “Tweener” still has a negative connotation in regards to 3/4s. Think players like Tobias Harris and Rui Hachimura who aren’t really that big but are also a bit slow defending the perimeter. Though, as years go by I think the 4 is catering this kind of player more and more (as long as they are a good shooter)"
I think Rui Hachimura is due for a breakout season.
Hachimura is a decent defender though right?  I know the other two are horrific but I feel like I remember Rui being decent on defense
"I think the Deni Avdija, Alex Len, Rui Hachimura frontcourt from the wizards was comparable"
Which part is delusional? That Westbrook stat pads and doesn't make his teammates better? The Wizards have a young supporting cast with some potential. Not every team is built stacked like the Durant/Steph Warriors or Brooklyn today. The Wizards are built like every other mediocre team. They paid Westbrook (Former MVP) and Beal (2nd leading scorer) and have young potential stars like Rui Hachimura to support them.
"Rui Hachimura, Bertans, Robin Lopez, Gafford."
Rui Hachimura confirmed future MVP
"All I know is it’s been fun seeing Rui Hachimura, Bradley Beal, and Russell Westbrook on the same team. Can’t wait to see them next season with a new coach.  &gt; It turns out that most people only react to basketball as entertainment and popularity contests instead of respectfully learning how the game should be played in 2021  And what’s wrong with that? The average fan dgaf about TS, VORP, offensive rating, etc. People just wanna see stars play ball regardless of analytics."
"You have to be good at drafting for that to happen. Their Current GM has been a high ranking member of the organization since 2003. Go look at their draft picks in that span. They have drafted TWO players that became consistent starters. One was John Wall who was a massive star in college and the first pick the other was Beal who they drafted ahead of Dame. The only other decent players they drafted Swaggy P, Rui Hachimura, and Jordon Clarkson who didn't play a game before they traded him for cash. They drafted Otto Porter 3rd overall."
"Can you please tell me where in my comment I said ""Westbrook has a higher usage than Bradley Beal"" idk what youre talking about I just said he was ""high usage"" as he did create more points than anyone on the celtics so I am sure that classifies.   Youre mentioning kemba and smart who each missed 30+ games and then fournier who they just got after the deadline those two? Ok I'll mention Rui Hachimura and Bertans then. The comparison was on the offensive end and its quite honestly not close Beal is a top 4 scorer in the league on offense where Brown isnt top 20.   I can even give you 20 or so names in no order who are better scorers than Brown: Curry, Lebron, AD, KD, Harden, Tatum, Beal, Kyrie, Jokic, Embiid, Lavine, Luka, Kawhi, Booker, Middleton, Lillard, Mitchell, Giannis, Trae, PG, Zion, Randle (who I just is debatable). Just of the top of my head."
"Second half of the lottery probably?   Zion, Ja, Barrett, and Garland would be top 4.  The rest of the lottery would probably be (in some order): DeAndre Hunter, Coby White, Tyler Herro, PJ Washington, Matisse Thybulle, Cam Johnson, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr., Jordan Poole, Rui Hachimura. Maybe throw in Gafford or Clarke or Reddish or someone else instead.  Pretty weak draft so far, looking back on it."
Ready for Rui Hachimura to take the next step as a scorer and for Deni Avdija to show his skills with the ball.
Not team USA but really excited for how Rui Hachimura grows from these Olympics

"Woah woah woah. Reality check, this roster isn’t very good save for your trio of big men and Brad - Raul Neto and Aaron holiday are barely nba role players, and are at best the 12th man on a championship team. KCP sucked of the teet that was the bubble lakers, and is simply a role player. Rui hachimura is an empty stats scorer that is probably unplayable in a playoff game due to being a tweener on defense. I’m not totally dead on Kuz, I could see him putting some things together honestly. Deni is totally unproved. Mr Lazer is unplayable if he’s not hitting 40 foot bombs."

"What's your re-draft to include all 3 of them in the top 7? I think there's a pretty clear top 5 in Zion, Ja, RJ, Hunter and Garland, and then there's only two spots left for:  * Keldon Johnson  * Jordan Poole  * Kevin Porter Jr  * Rui Hachimura  * Tyler Herro  * PJ Washington  * Matisse Thybulle"

Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
"Rui Hachimura, please God"
"He's right to feel that way, honestly he was overrated as a shot creator in his first seasons, but still, he has some shot creation ability, way more than what he's shown in the last 2 seasons, I was kinda surprised they didn't even try to go to him more when both AD and Bron was out.  On a team like the Wiz he should get chances, quite honestly I don't see any reason why Rui Hachimura should get more chances for example, he's shown way more"
Rui Hachimura will be a future all star. Flame away.
"A read on me? Lol. Some random quotes that all seem to be vaguely about the same thing but also not at all. A clip of someone shouting out you(allegedly this is referring to you directly, I assume) on Mad Money, a joke of a show, and then a remix of some song from X-Men. My reaction to that is that this conversation is getting more and more boring.  You got your proof yet? You even claimed to get the actual Rui Hachimura here to weigh in on things."
"You’re linking an article that’s almost a year old when more recent articles came out that shows that Japanese people are willing to get vaccinated and going against what you’re claiming. (https://apnews.com/article/business-health-japan-coronavirus-pandemic-4b409cf1a663759d6a434fe1faf0cc2d) Whether historically the country is skeptical of vaccines or not doesn’t matter now when it’s shown that people are taking the vaccine and the rate has passed over 50%, which is going into majority numbers. Also, you’re linking an article that says that Japan is cautious about the vaccine, not actually being anti-vax. You’re actually spreading misinformation here, whether you mean to or not. Unless you have direct connections with someone in Japan or are currently living in Japan or have recently lived in Japan, it’s silly to make claims like that without actually knowing yourself.  As for Rui Hachimura, yes we don’t know if he’s vaccinated or not, but the case is strong for him being vaccinated since he’s a part of the NBA, which has been pushing for the players to be vaccinated. Until we know for certain from someone official, it’s more likely that he is, but again we don’t know. The personal reasons can be anything."
"That there’s a Reddit account with the username “Hachimura?” This is Reddit. You gotta come with waaaaaayyy more proof than that.  On the off chance that you are Rui, just wanna say I’m a huge fan and my son thinks you’re amazing."
"Team Adidas. Trae is a great foul baiter, Donovan Mitchell is built like a tank, and Evan Mobley is a better defender than Rui Hachimura."

"Rui hachimura, book it"
"Defining “Surprise player” is kinda the crux of this whole question. To me, it’s not a surprise if Scottie Barnes becomes a superstar. He was drafted 4th overall, and had great expectations coming into the league based on his physical frame and skill level. Maybe he wasn’t viewed that way by casual fans that don’t follow the draft but anyone picked that high in a loaded draft should have superstar potential.  I’ll say Cole Anthony. Was picked low in a weak draft class, didn’t make much noise his rookie year. Now he’s off to a really hot start, and I legitimately think if he keep it up he can steal the franchise starting PG spot from Fultz and Suggs. His shooting is improved, he’s still got good athleticism and seems to be stepping up his playmaking. He also has a really confident and determined mindset that will serve him well as he tries to break through. I’m not saying it’s incredibly likely he becomes a SUPERSTAR but I also think it’s not out of the question and All Star seems to be a possibility for him. And I think if you asked, very few would have suggested that on draft night or his rookie year  Honorable mention to Rui Hachimura who I think has a sneaky high ceiling."
"It's not an irrational argument.  I have very little pity for someone who locks himself in a building and lights it on fire.  The team isn't torturing him about the mental health, he's trying to take advantage of it as a loophole to still get paid.  He tried to use a nonexistent back injury before and that didn't work.  It's pretty obvious if you follow what he and his agent have done that he's not going through a genuine mental health crisis, and frankly it's pretty disgusting for him to fake it.  There are plenty of people with real mental health issues, like Rui Hachimura, and Ben's petty bullshit is outrageously disrespectful for them."
"Any wizards fan would tell you either rui hachimura, who has been playing outstandingly in his first 2 years, and we can’t wait to get him back, or deni avdija, who is emerging as a crazy good defender for us"
I honestly don’t think that’s the case look at both Rui Hachimura and Calvin Ridley. Rui asked for time off due to his mental health as well as Calvin Ridley who plays another sport. The difference between them and Ben is that it seemed much more genuine and not a way to avoid playing. Both of their teams also expressed their support for them. You can’t say this whole Ben Simmons mental health saga has been very shady with it just looking like Ben not wanting to play and looking for excuses
" &gt;I'm sure if a player told his team that they needed some time away from the game for their mental health, the team wouldn't find it necessary to fine them.  Exhibit A: Rui Hachimura  People pretending there ain't a nice way to do this are embarrassing themselves by showing how little they've been paying attention."
Rui Hachimura isn't playing due to mental health.
Spencer Dinwiddie free agent pick up and we got got three good players in their primes from the Lakers for Westbrook and  two of them have championship experience. Deepest bench in the league and that's without Rui Hachimura and Thomas Bryant playing. Beal gets to score at all levels without the need to bail the team out all the time. Brooks is no longer the coach.
Wizards don’t even have Thomas Bryant and Rui Hachimura. They’re absolutely scared
"Thanks, the NBA is so foreign to me with second round draft picks being basically worthless. I have been disappointed they couldn't get the late lottery Gonzaga players I knew would have an impact Sabonis, Brandon Clarke Bf Rui Hachimura. As someone who follows college more I've been kind of confused with the draft picks we've made over the last like 10 years"
"I’m not a homer. I understand we (probably) won’t be even a top five seed a couple months from now. But we’ve also been performing well without Rui Hachimura and Beal playing poorly. If Beal especially can get things going, I think we’ll be able to prove a lot of people wrong."

"The crazy thing is they don’t even have Rui Hachimura back and I think that under the significantly better coaching of Unseld Jr, he’s gonna have a breakout season this or next year. Dude is crazy talented and just from watching a few of their games last year, I get the feeling that he’ll be an All Star at some point.  Mostly sad we lost KCP, he was my favorite Laker the last 2 seasons we definitely miss his and Caruso’s 3 point shooting and defensive hustle."
"- I mean we were 17-6 after we acquired Gafford last year. Much better than running Mo Wagner, Robin Lopez, and Alex Len.  - Westbrook lost us at least 5 games at the beginning of the season, and Scott Brooks probably lost us another 5-10 with his poor lineup managed, inability to coach in the last few minutes, and pure incompetence.  - We added Dinwiddie, KCP, Kuzma, Harrell ... in place of Westbrook, Matthews, Bonga/Hutchison, and Lopez/Len. Big boost in quality role players.   - We still haven't seen Thomas Bryant or Rui Hachimura this year.   - Bertans has been out awhile  - Beal has actually been playing like ass, we should get better when he's on form again."
"Honestly too much to even fit in one post. Kuzma is really shining as a 3rd scoring option behind Beal and Dinwiddie, hell one could even argue he could be the 2nd scoring option. His defense is shining. We'll see if Bertans wakes up anytime soon and starts making 3s again, although I feel like we've seen some improvements with his off ball movement  So much development to keep track of too with a lot of young players to be excited about. Daniel Gaffords only 23, and when he got traded from the Bulls last season, that's when the Wizards defense really started honing in on a defensive presence in the paint. He plays super hard every minute too. Deni Avdija has been a huge surprise defensively as well, almost becoming our go to defender that can guard positions 1-5. He still has some work on the offensive side but I'm sure it'll come eventually, given his record in Tel Aviv.    And we still have Rui Hachimura who was also amazing last season on the defensive end, runs hard to finish at the rim, and developing a deadly mid-range game that can buy a bucket when we need it.   All of this new defense really opens it up for Thomas Bryant to bring his return too. A big knock on him has always been his defense, but if you have quality defenders in the 3 and 4 positions, and a long and tall Spencer Dinwiddie at PG, they can cover his gaps while he shoots from downtown and brings back his passion to the team.  Honestly there's just so much to be excited about with them this season."
I might be missing something but what happened to rui hachimura? Haven't seen his name on the roster. Was he traded somewhere?
"&gt; You mention that Ben doesn't have the power to end this situation, but he absolutely does. At any moment he wants to be done or if his mental health was so bad he could just decide that the remaining money doesn't matter.  Ok, so don't the sixers have the same responsibility to let it go? Ben can't control his brain, but the sixers could easily let it go.  &gt;The clause in the contract is meant for good faith and to be there to actually help players and in turn help the team. If you want an example of this we have a perfect example of someone who is deserving of mental illness paid leave and thats Rui Hachimura  You know nothing of whether this is ""good faith"" or not. You've assumed that it's not with no reason to. This and Rui's situation are completely different given that Rui's situation wasn't caused or exacerbated by the team. The sixers haven't done anything to dissuade the media from making a spectacle of it, instead throwing fuel on the fire. Anyone in that situation would want out, and it's not fair to expect someone to give up their compensation when they're not in the wrong.   &gt;If that is the case shouldn't you also feel no need to empathize with Ben?  Only reason I'm trying is because there's a bunch of ignorant redditors shitting on him. If people let him and the sixers quietly resolve this without heaps of BS drama, I wouldn't bother giving the situation a second thought.  &gt; what world has the Sixers not be at the least fair about how they've handled this. How does the blame not fall on the man who has only made excuses and refused to in any shape act in good faith or work with the Sixers.  Publicly calling him out like they did is shitty even if it's ""fair"". As I mentioned before, not even trying to keep the media circus in check is a seriously shitty way to handle things. Notice how the sixers have been making quotes and talking shit, but Ben says one time that they're making things worse, and suddenly everyone's jumping down his throat? It's such a backwards response from a league which supposedly is making strides in mental health care."
"You must not watch the Wizards then. Beal's outside shooting hasn't been great but he has arguably been our best perimeter defender this season.  The real reason we are winning is because last year our only healthy wing was an inexperienced Rui Hachimura. We would get demplished by guys like Tatum, Tobias Harris, Jimmy Butler, Giannis etc because we had no one who could guard them. We had several guys in our rotation who aren't even in the league.  This year we have KCP, Kuzma, Harrell, healthy Deni, and Hachimura who is coming back. We have a lot of versatile wings who can play both ends of the floor and run the court. Not surprisingly our defense has greatly improved."
I don’t the specifics of the mental health clause but I think it might. Rui Hachimura went through (still going?) through a similar situation
"You mention that Ben doesn't have the power to end this situation, but he absolutely does. At any moment he wants to be done or if his mental health was so bad he could just decide that the remaining money doesn't matter. The only reason their is an issue right now is because he wants the money on his contract without the work.    The clause in the contract is meant for good faith and to be there to actually help players and in turn help the team. If you want an example of this we have a perfect example of someone who is deserving of mental illness paid leave and thats Rui Hachimura. It isn't meant to be used as an excuse to not play. It's there so a player can get the help they need, get better, and than come back to the team strong.   I think its bullshit to try and be equating this situation to mental health stigma and in turn validate his situation. Ben hasn't given anyone valid cause to believe in his mental illness. You can't first claim a fake injury to get paid and not play and than after that doesn't work flip over to mental illness as another way out. That is pretty damning evidence against his case.   I find it extremely odd you feel that you don't need to empathize with someone unless you are calling them evil. If that is the case shouldn't you also feel no need to empathize with Ben?   You say the Sixers deserve a ton of blame for the handling so far, but I find that a little silly. In what world has the Sixers not be at the least fair about how they've handled this. How does the blame not fall on the man who has only made excuses and refused to in any shape act in good faith or work with the Sixers."
And the NBA comparison is Rui Hachimura.  Nothing but respect on how that seems to be handled both from the individual and the organization.  Meanwhile Simmons and the 76ers ultimately can both suck a dick.  Faults are on both sides at this point.
“Rui Hachimura has resumed being around the team in recent days and is likely to be fully reintegrated within the next two weeks.”

"In his defense it’s hard to be good on defense flanked by Deni avdija, rui hachimura, and Westbrook"
Rui Hachimura
"Compare this to Rui Hachimura situation and how it’s been handled.  Rui is clearly going through a tonne of stuff, dealing with racial abuse and stress and pressures in his life. Apparently he lost nearly 20lbs of muscle and has been doing private workouts to get back into playing shape.  Management and the FO has kept everything hush hush making sure the media don’t make a circus out of it or try to make stories out of what is happening.  I love that Tommy S and the FO have made sure that he feels supported and have encouraged to take it at his own pace. No force or pressure for him to come back. The coaching staff have been sending him video footage of plays so that he can watch it at his leisure to get himself integrated back into the team when ready.  If Ben is lying about what is going on when players **actually** are going through mental illness and struggles due to depression and the like, it’s really disgusting.  I hope for Ben’s sake it’s not the case and that if he really is truly struggling that he’s getting the help he needs."
"Yeah I’m sort of following it like you laid out above. You said A, so give us X and Y so we will continue to pay you.   Every time they can find him in violation they’re just adding to their case—- to what end, I’m not sure yet—— and getting the violations on permanent league record for lack of a better word.   There are other ways to do this, for sure. I doubt the Wiz are being nearly this hard-handed with Rui Hachimura for example."
" &gt;99% of the posts in this thread are doing the opposite of jumping to his defence.   Oh you should see the previous threads then.  &gt;None of us know whether he’s “making a pawn out of mental health issues” or not.   &gt;If he’s seeing a counsellor all the employer gets to know is attendance and participation. If they want more details than that it’s a massive red flag and the union should be immediately concerned.  Cmon guy, did you hear any of this the first time the team called him?  Correct, he didn't need to detail details, just say that he's dealing with some personal issues and wouldn't be able to report on time. That's what Rui Hachimura did. But did Simmons do that? No he didn't even do that. He ghosted everyone and that's it. Everyone was left wondering what he was up to in the beginning of this saga.  Not until he learned that his money is not coming back that he flew to Philly and the word 'mental health' came out from his camp for the first time."
"Rui Hachimura walks into a dojo while heading to a charity basketball game in Tokyo, Japan. After speaking with Leotsu, a martial arts master, Rui goes to another dimension, the Second World, where he must rescue a young boy named Nezu from the evil mummy Sett Ra."
"I mean, there are plenty of other players not playing because of mental health from Calvin Ridley to Rui Hachimura who aren't the ire of over a million people no matter where they go. I find it pretty fucked up, as some who suffers pretty intensely, that people feel like they can say what's going on from the outside, even if he's a socialite diva."
"&gt;But his injury was quad injury? And something unrelated to his degenerative knee condition? He didn't even let Pop to announce that he would be out for the season leaving them in limbo.  Overcompensation from the quad issues. And he lost trust in the team when they didnt believe he wasnt ready to play  &gt;They're not random people. He's literally contractually obligated to inform the team of his health conditions.  That’s not how mental health works. You don’t have to inform your employer of the details of your actual sessions. This isnt him failing to provide xrays of broken bone.   &gt;He didn't even need to detail details if he wanted to, just tell the team he has personal issues and wouldn't be able to start training camp on time. Instead he ghosted the team until he learned that his checks aren't coming back.  Obviously he wasnt planning on returning at all.   &gt;Rui Hachimura has more maturity and professionalism than this dude the way he communicated his personal issues with the Wizards. He just didnt admit the mental health issues until he realized he wasnt able to get out of Philly. Huh, I wonder why that is the case.  Because why would he want to bring it up if he didnt have to? He wants out and he thought he’d be traded before the season started. Hachimura doesnt have any ill will towards the Wizards  &gt;Maybe. Please do enlighten me.  It’s a spectrum and affects everyone differently. It’s not as simple as “A did this, so B should do this”. Two people can suffer from the same thing and it can manifest in many different ways. Plus we dont know exactly what Ben’s issues are so it doesnt make sense to say what he could/ couldn’t do.   It’d be like hearing a player is injured and trying to fill in the blanks when we dont have enough info about the injury."
"&gt;The same Kawhi that ended up with a degenerative calf issue? He was right  But his injury was quad injury? And something unrelated to his degenerative knee condition? He didn't even let Pop to announce that he would be out for the season leaving them in limbo.  &gt;Reasonable as people dont usually divulge their therapy sessions with people  They're not random people. He's literally contractually obligated to inform the team of his health conditions.  He didn't even need to detail details if he wanted to, just tell the team he has personal issues and wouldn't be able to start training camp on time.

Huh, I wonder why that is the case.  &gt; You really have 0 understanding of people that struggle with mental health  Maybe. Please do enlighten me."
"[Rui has also been on a 2k cover, ](https://www.thefamicast.com/2021/08/hachimura-cover-athlete-for-japanese.html?m=1)can Ben say that???"
"Nothing in that article contradicted what Mayo said.   Mayo clearly said he hadn't been to the facility while his teammates were there.   Shepard's quote doesnt say anything other than that he's been at the facility.  Mayo:  &gt;According to multiple sources, Hachimura hasn’t been in the practice facility at the same time as his teammates. “We haven’t seen him at all,” one source told me. “Maybe he does individual workouts at night, I’m not sure. We have no idea what’s going on with him.”  Shepard:  &gt;“Rui is progressing daily and comes to the facility regularly. He is working on conditioning and putting in court time—all part of a return to play plan that Wes refers to each time asked,” Wizards general manager Tommy Sheppard tells City Paper."
&gt; Kawaii Leonard  Rui Hachimura
"It’s always funny to see Westbrook apologists grasp at straws to deny something that should be common knowledge to anybody who understands basketball at even a basic level.   The reason the coaching looks better is because it’s much, much easier to coach low usage players like Kuz, KCP, and Trez than it is to coach Russell Westbrook. What can a coach say to a low IQ player who insists on shooting a high volume of shots despite being one of the most inefficient scorers in the league?  Is he a better coach than Brooks? Probably. Would Unseld Jr. be able to turn Westbrook into an effective player? Absolutely not. **We’re talking about a guy who shot *under* 40% from the field in 4/5 of the last postseasons he participated in**. The guy exists to waste possessions and be an inefficient player.  And that isn’t even mentioning his defence. For as much shit as he got, Kuzma really stepped up his defence the last few years. KCP has always been a good defender. Replacing a garbage tier defender with two positive ones is obviously going to have a large impact.  For all your talk of injuries: Rui Hachimura and Thomas Bryant haven’t even touched the floor.  If you can come up with a response other than “I watch games and you don’t 🤪” I’d love to hear it. I watch all teams. I just turn off the Westbrook blinders when doing so."

Where. In. The. World. Is. Rui Hachimura?   (Sung in the tune of Carmen Sandiego)
"Rui ""en immons"" Hachimura"
"It’s been known for a long time that he wasn’t playing. Google it and you’ll see reports from before the season started. [Here’s an ESPN article about it.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32277984/rui-hachimura-miss-opening-washington-wizards-training-camp-personal-reasons-team-says%3Fplatform%3Damp)  It’s totally fine if you didn’t know, nobody is gonna be up to date with literally everything. But it’s been public knowledge for a while."
Let me try to help you since you're so confused...  I had no idea Rui Hachimura wasn't playing until I saw this reddit post.  I watch espn and go on the the ringer and other sports sites.  I don't think this is widely talked about by the nba media
"Rui ""Carmen Sandiego"" Hachimura."
Tommy Sheppard was able to turn John Wall’s contract into one of the deepest teams in the NBA.  And the team will be even deeper with Rui Hachimura and Thomas Bryant coming back.
