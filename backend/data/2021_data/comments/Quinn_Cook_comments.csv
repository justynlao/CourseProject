"GSW has a good record of making ass players look like solid role players.  Ian Clark, Quinn Cook, Damian Jones, Patrick McCaw, Mckinnie  Playing with Steph/Dray/KD must be nice"
"Ive got 7 pages to go of players, but heres how divisions are shaking out:       \*\*The Kitchen\*\*  Dwayne Bacon  Jordan Bone  Quinn Cook  Seth/Steph Curry       \*\*dopplenamers\*\*  LaMelo/Lonzo Ball  Jordan Bell  Rudy Gay  Kyle Guy       \*\*Scenic\*\*  Mikal/Miles Bridges  Dillon Brooks  Trent Forrest  Dearon Fox            \*\*Festive\*\*  Aaron/Jrue/Justin Holiday  Darius Garland"
Quinn cook thinks this is MyCareer
That driver should be fired. Lavine isnt someone like Quinn Cook who you can leave behind.
"Not to mention Javale, Ian Clark, Quinn Cook, Pat McCaw...these are players who really had no interest from teams until they played for us."
Wasn’t KD good friends with Quinn Cook?
Quinn Cook is a victory cigar
Every game I miss the interior presence of Dwight Howard. Why did we pick Quinn Cook over that man
"The cap spike isn't the reason they managed to get good production out of players like Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, and Kevon Looney, it was good coaching. They even turned around Javales career. The Warriors consistently made players better."
thank you Mr Quinn Cook!!
"The whopping two games he didn’t play in the playoffs? One of which the Warriors barely won with CP3 shooting 3-14? Uh, okay.  &gt; Because if you actually watch, KD started doing this after game 2 of Clippers before any injury. He went from being super passive (only averaging 12 FGA over a month) to super aggressive for no reason other than to fill his own ego.  After he made his “you know who I am” comment which apparently deeply hurt you for some inexplicably stupid reason, he lit the Clippers and then the Rockets up, consecutively. He averaged 35/5/5 against the Clippers on 72% TS, for fuck’s sake. Lou Will and PBev went on to have a memorable interview where they said they tried every defensive scheme on KD and couldn’t do anything, and highlighted KD making that statement as a genuine turning point.  You’re crying about this as if it’s a bad thing.   &gt; Except it's not, every sane person agrees Golden State looked like a completely different team without KD.   You mean, like an excellent, record-breaking team but not a broken team that’s the greatest ever assembled and destroying any semblance of parity in the NBA?  Odd now to see from you, highly intelligent NBA analyst, that the Warriors are somehow tougher without KD. It’s a wonder everyone still cries about KD joining the Warriors.   &gt; Yeah no fucking shit, the Warriors were a top heavy team paying KD big money, when he's injured we have to play guys like Quinn Cook and McKinnie to guard Kawhi Leonard and Lowry. It's a fucking testament to how well Curry impacts the offense that they even won those 2 games.  Of course. And if KD had played and the Warriors won, you’d be saying that his likely 30+ ppg on 60% TS was trivial and in fact somehow damaging to the team’s pure, angelic basketball style. Even though they fucking won, lol. Too transparent."
"&gt; You keep bringing up a 100% win rate against the Rockets without KD... what, in the regular season? What? You think that’s a salient point?  No this includes playoffs as well when KD was injured   &gt;  wouldn’t that only highlight KD’s impact? That he was able to make up for his superstar teammate’s relative struggles and then some against a tough Rockets team?  Because if you actually watch, KD started doing this after game 2 of Clippers before any injury. He went from being super passive (only averaging 12 FGA over a month) to super aggressive for no reason other than to fill his own ego.   &gt; I know it was especially clear how unimportant KD was to that team when he got injured and they went on to lose to the Raptors 4-2.  No one here is claiming KD wasn't unimportant, stop attacking a strawman. What's being discussed here is KD had a 'stylistic tension' with the team which hurt the team, not always, but very frequently depending on what he wanted to prove. KD wasn't playing ego iso ball in 2017 when this team was at its absolute peak.   &gt;  that “stylistic tension” and actual impact on the court are two completely different arguments.  Except it's not, every sane person agrees Golden State looked like a completely different team without KD. Seth Curry claims Golden State was 'not better, but harder to guard due to increased ball motion' when KD was injured. Literally even the shit analysts could see the difference like night and day. Which means you're even below that level. And I emphasize again that KD did not always have this iso mentality on Golden State because the dude is damn fickle, it's evaluated on a series by series basis.  &gt; how unimportant KD was to that team when he got injured and they went on to lose to the Raptors 4-2.  Yeah no fucking shit, the Warriors were a top heavy team paying KD big money, when he's injured we have to play guys like Quinn Cook and McKinnie to guard Kawhi Leonard and Lowry. It's a fucking testament to how well Curry impacts the offense that they even won those 2 games."
Buy him out and sure. Take quinn cook and we'll take both.
"&gt;  second best team in the West  How did they do in the playoffs?   &gt; Iguodala was litterally an all defense player  If you're arguing Iguodala is a good player, hats off to you, no one is arguing against that. He's the only comparable player to the guys I mentioned in the modern NBA.   &gt; Bogut was all defense THAT year  No he wasn't, he made 2nd team in 2015  &gt; Barnes has been a solid starter his whole career, he sucked in the 2016 finals ?  Barnes is worse than Wiggins, there's literally 0 reasons to mentioning him when talking about how 'stacked' the 2016 warriors were. The guy was shooting 15% on open 3s, it would have been an easy 4-0 if he didn't choke so bad in the finals. Oubre is a far better defender and is in the worst NBA shooting slump of all time, that's not representative of what he'll be.   &gt; Barbosa had declined yeah, he was still a guy that had multiplle double digits scoring games in the playoffs in very limited mins.  ​You could say this for any number of players, fucking hell Quinn Cook scored nearly 30 in some games against the Spurs in 2018 playoffs.   &gt; Saying those guys aren't better than Wiggins who has played one month of winning basketball in his entire career, Wiseman who is a rookie center who is lost 90% of the time and Kelly Oubre who has been an offensive disaster until last night is just not honest and it's not vene considering how much the 2015 Warriors fit perfectly what Kerr wanted to run.  The 2016 Warriors had several years to develop chemistry, this team is entirely new. I'm only talking about sheer talent and relevance in the modern game. Livingston even in his prime wouldn't get minutes in the modern NBA, he literally can't defend or shoot the 3. Wiseman can shoot the 3, that's easily his biggest trait aside from his physical attributes. Guys like Barbosa, Ezeli, Varejao, and Speights couldn't even get minutes in the playoffs because Kerr knew they'd get cooked by LeBron in the PnR, now you have a roster that can actually defend multiple positions. Bogut at least could protect the rim but even he was sub optimal which is why Iguodala had to be part of the small ball lineup. Please stop acting like you know basketball"
Put  Quinn Cook in you cowards
"I think LA was much deeper last year than people realised.  LeBron, AD, Danny Green, KCP, Rondo, Caruso, Kuzma and Dwight were all legit big minute guys in the playoffs. Bradley would have been if not for his son’s health issues. And that’s not counting Kieff cos nobody knew we’d get him. So Lakers had 9 legit playoff guys + Javale who can play some minutes.  Thing is people think of depth in terms of how much your bench players score per game instead of everything else, which the Lakers had.  I still don’t love Brooklyn’s roster but there’s zero reason to believe this is the roster they’ll have by playoff time.  At a similar point in the season last year, the Lakers were playing Quinn Cook and Troy Daniels major minutes, and waiting on Boogie’s return. Their rotation changed a lot by the playoffs and I suspect Brooklyn’s will too"
PG - Quinn Cook  SG - Quinndary Wetherspoon  SF - Quincy Pondexter  PF - Quentin Richardson  C - Quincy Acy
"Nepotism is a good enough reason to keep around an end of the bench guy like the non Giannis Greek bros or Quinn cook, but letting it decide a starter or influence who got moved if you are seriously trying to contend is asinine."
"&gt;The warriors was a net -11.2 rating with Quinn Cook and a -7.5 net rating with Nick Young and -11.6 with McCaw.  McCaw was 10th on the team in total minutes, and Cook was 14th.  Young was 6th, and if you're getting housed with your 6th man on the court, maybe that's a problem.  &gt;Curry missed over 30 games and KD missed 14 games, also Klay and Draymond missed \~10.   Every team has players miss \~10.  Curry was still 4th in minutes.  &gt;Next regarding their opponents since you seem to like using regular season rating as a measurement - the rockets were 1st in oRTG (14th highest in history) and 6th in dRTG (30th best in history)   Yes, and still a flawed team that relied on shooting 42 threes a game and baiting officials into foul calls, which is a recipe for losing a playoff series if you go cold and/or officials let teams play in the playoffs.  &gt;And the KD GSW swept 5 series in 3 years....... does this not make it more impressive that Kobe and Shaq or Kareem and Magic took over 12 years?   One was a first-round series against an injured opponent, and three others were against injured and not-very-good opponents in later rounds.  That said, we were specifically discussing the 2018 and 2019 Warrior teams, which, as I said, were very unremarkable."
"Quoting 3p% is quite irrelevant when discussing rating, more nuances need to be explored -  The warriors was a net -11.2 rating with Quinn Cook and a -7.5 net rating with Nick Young and -11.6 with McCaw.   Curry missed over 30 games and KD missed 14 games, also Klay and Draymond missed ~10.  Next regarding their opponents since you seem to like using regular season rating as a measurement - the rockets were 1st in oRTG (14th highest in history) and 6th in dRTG (30th best in history)  And the KD GSW swept 5 series in 3 years....... does this not make it more impressive that Kobe and Shaq or Kareem and Magic took over 12 years?"
"&gt; Quinn cook, Nick Young, Patrick McCaw, Jordan Bell averaged 14-22 minutes per game while their minutes in the playoffs dropped to &lt;10 minutes.   Quinn Cook shot 44% from 3, on over 3 attempts per ( in just 33 games, by the way, so you're being a little disingenuous there ).  He wasn't exactly killing their offensive rating.  Young shot 38% on 4.  And it's not like they were blowing every team out -- they lost 24 games and had a net rating of +6, which was 3rd-best that season.  &gt; If you look at the playoff stats, the GSW were 1st in both oRTG and dRTG.    &gt;   &gt;\[and\]   &gt;   &gt;The Lakers last year lost their first game against the Blazers and Rockets  Those Blazers and Rockets won nearly as many games as those Warriors' first two playoff opponents -- despite the season being 10 games shorter.  The 2018 Warriors played the least-impressive slate of playoff opponents in history, and I don't believe there's a team within even shouting distance of them.  The only even good team they played took them to seven, despite being pretty flawed to start, and injured.  &gt;To put it into perspective as successful as MJ teams have been, he has only swept teams in BO7 3 times.    On the other hand, Magic Johnson was involved in winning 5 4-0 sweeps, in just 12 seasons.  As did Kobe Bryant, in more seasons.  James, for the record, has a ridiculous 12 four-game sweeps to his credit so far."
"I would say when bringing up stats you chose the regular season, which can be kind of taken a bit out of context for example: Quinn cook, Nick Young, Patrick McCaw, Jordan Bell averaged 14-22 minutes per game while their minutes in the playoffs dropped to &lt;10 minutes.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA\_2018.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2018.html)  If you look at the playoff stats, the GSW were 1st in both oRTG and dRTG.  &amp;#x200B;  and idk, 4 - 0 sweeps are pretty rare these days and not sure if they should be the best measurement of success.  The Lakers last year lost their first game against the Blazers and Rockets and nearly lost two in a row to the nuggets if not for a buzzer beater, but you knew in a BO7 the Lakers had nearly full victory.  Even the fact that they won 4 - 2 against the heat, we kind of knew it wasn't really that competitive at all and all about closing it out.  To put it into perspective as successful as MJ teams have been, he has only swept teams in BO7 3 times. (Small info disclaimer, in the old BO5 system he has swept them most but not all times but obviously winning 3 is lot easier than winning 4)"
It's gotta be disrespectful for a team to not only see the Lakers put out Quinn Cook but then Lebron wore sandals with 3 minutes left in the game
Quinn Cook is in. Gg pelicans nice try
Wtf this aint over till quinn cook gets to dribble dribble dribble
i wanna see Zion yam on Quinn Cook
"So the players on minimum contracts are Marc Gasol- a lot of reports that teams were not willing to offer him a second year like we did and a ton of people saying he was washed after the bubble. I never really saw any reports he was going to be playing for much more than the minimum  Markeiff Morris- again, only offers I saw reports for was a minimum from the clippers and minimum from us which other than the 8 mil a year contract he signed when tv deals blew up the cap is right in line with his career salaries and his production Alfonzo McKinnie- no explanation necessary  Jared Dudley-he’s just happy to be here.  Quinn cook- literally signed because people like him Those are the 5 guys on minimum deals. The two that get real minutes (Gasol and Morris) combine to average 9 points a game. Im fairly certain if another team was willing to pay them significantly more, they wouldn’t be here. Any team with cap space could have had them."
"Quinn Cook would play better than Oofre, if he was still a Warrior"
He's better than or comparable to:      DJ Augustin   Reggie Jackson     Tre Jones   Yogi Ferrell   Tim Frazier   Dellavedova   Quinn Cook   Chris Clemons   MCW   Brad Wannamaker   Jeff Teague   Dennis Smith Jr   Ish Smith  Cameron Payne   Frank Ntilikina   Raul Neto      go fuck yasself
"You think '19 warriors had depth? Their top 4 off the bench (by minutes played) were Looney, Jerebko, Quinn Cook, and Alfonzo McKinnie."
A little disappointed that we missed out on the mandatory Quinn Cook dribble to end the game
"Quinn ""Tony Soprano: Sanitation"" Cook"
Quinn Cook garbage time champion!
"Quinn Cook, garbage time GOD"
"Quinn Cook, whatever Morris we got and whatever aremtuntakumpo we got and a 2nd rounder"
"Dudley, John Wall, Quinn Cook, and Dennis from his OKC days say otherwise. May be a prick as the opposing man but seems like his teammates get along wit him kinda like Boogie"
Simmons  probably wouldn't drive to the rack with Quinn Cook guarding him.  he's gotta go
quinn cook
"this is so wholesome I love it  imagine growing up watching Bron - you're buying his jerseys, playing streetball with your friends trying to emulate his moves, and picking the Cavs as your team just so you can shoot around as your hero  you make it to college ball through talent, hard work and dedicate, watching as Bron starts racking up rings in Miami  you get drafted into the NBA, completely in disbelief that you're playing in the same league finally as your idol  as fate would have it, you one day end up on the same team as your god.  he dabs you up from time to time, gives you an approving nod, and tells you you've got nice footwork.  then one day, one game, and one season removed from Bron bringing another championship to LA, you're just happy to be there on the bench watching him do his thing.  he gets possession, time slows down, he turns, looks at you and your homies, then proceeds to spin and drill a 3 while giving you props   you go home after and make love to your woman with all the heart and passion of 20 LeBron James, as you prepare to finish, you whisper in her ear ""Lefuckyou3"".  your name is Quinn Cook and you just became a father that night"
A team that forgets Quinn Cook in the bubble.
Would have been nice instead of Quinn cook or mckinnie
We could've used Damion Lee in general in 2019. Instead we had Quinn Cook
"The disrespect not linking Iguodala’s swagger. Funny enough, Quinn Cook was on the bench too, guy gets to see all this crazy shit live.   https://mobile.twitter.com/NBCSWarriors/status/1093382220738252800"
"Lakers up 3-1  Bron and AD ruled out for covid tracking. Lakers have the minimum number of roster players, must play.   Starting lineup: Wes Mathews, THT, Kostas, Marc Gasol, Quinn Cook.  Swept by the Hornets to come back to a game 7 finals championship."
quinn “victory cigar” cook
Mason Jones fails the sneaky steal on Quinn Cook at the end of the game. But it's all fun so it's cool.
Quinn Cook = Garbage time Curry  THT = garbage time kawhi
Lakers win with the signature Quinn Cook dribbling out of the clock.
Where is my guy Quinn cook at? Let my guy play and call shots
"yeah this extension ruined every other box score. there's just so much good information and so much ridiculous information that isn't necessary, it's the best  like you guys thought saying stuff like ""quinn cook had a +/- of +3 in two minutes last night"" was a stupid thing to say? how about saying ""quinn cook had a net rating of +133.4 in two minutes last night"". that's the type of overkill the extension gives you and i love it"
Quinn Cook too  Dude seems to be close friends with every single player somehow
"Who's available for the minimum ?  Plus, with only 928K left under the hard cap, I think they might have to free up space (eg waiving Quinn cook) if they want a vet minimum"
"Shaq is the Quinn Cook of Inside the NBA, but thinks he's KD/AD."
"&gt; He is paid to be an entertainer.  He ain't entertaining either. Did you ever watch Kazaam or Blue Chips? His greatest entertainment success was the show he stole from Steve Nash.   He just rides the coattails of a show that was already successful without him. He's basically the Quinn Cook of Inside the NBA.   All he does is repeat the same 3 things over and over, which puts him at a Mark Jackson tier of entertainment. Probably why he was such a shitty rapper, too."
"West pick &amp; pop and his connection with Quinn Cook on DHO’s and give &amp; gos, we’re both amazing"
"Bro I love Iggy, but Kerr had to seriously offense-defense substitute Quinn Cook and Andre Iguodala bc we needed Cook’s shooting during the Raptor’s box-and-one. 2019 Iggy was clutch, but defenses still didn’t respect him and surrounded Curry w 2-3 guys.  Yes, he was vital. And Livingston would probably also be vital if Steph had went down and KD had to carry. Again, you don’t have an argument"
"Has to do with the back up point guards being Quinn cook and Shaun Livingston, PG position is too important to be run by some g-leaguers or some washed up vet who refuses to shoot 3s. Tf did you expect lmao"
I think he's saying Curry's backup was Quinn cook and Durant's backup was iguodala
"It's understandable. He just didn't feel as welcome or at home as he hoped he would because not only the fan base but the ownership and FO just had to remind him that this was Steph's team (*cringe*). So after his first season, he just wasn't feeling it any more. And I don't think he was really tight w/ any of the players on a personal level except for Quinn Cook (who everybody loves), and Draymond was the guy he talked basketball with, but their relationship eventually soured. And this all started happening before the outburst in Nov 2019.   I'm glad he's recovered from his Achilles and hope he finds what he's looking for w/ the Nets or wherever else he goes. I'm not gonna root against him unless we somehow end up playing him in the playoffs."
We got Quinn Cook and Kuzma. Straight up.
"You may remember the Warriors signing Quinn Cook to a two-way and then upgrading him to a regular NBA deal right before the playoffs started so he would be eligible. Otherwise he couldn't play, regardless of how many games/days he had left over."
"Goddam, we can’t have one thread where we don’t talk about him? Can we? Is it okay to leave him out for just one comment? Sick of hearing about Quinn Cook, man."
Winning at this level requires a lot of work beforehand. It's not a typical pickup game at the local YMCA.  Jared Dudley and Quinn Cook contributed to the Lakers title. So did Cousins.
"I will not respect Steph Curry until he wins a ring without Brandon Rush, Patrick McCaw, or Quinn Cook carrying his bum ass"
Yea and his second option on offense was Quinn Cook lmfao
We got Quinn Cook. Straight up.
We got Quinn Cook
"Quinn Cook is friends with AD, LeBron, KD. This guy must be cool asf to have those players as best friends."
We'll take Thybulle for one Quinn Cook then
quinn cook is a better player than lebron. just because lebron has better stats doesnt mean he was a better player
The difference from Iggy to Nick Young and Quinn Cook is massive
"I remember watching that team early in the year play Duke who had Jabari Parker, Rodney Hood and Quinn Cook and although it wasn’t a blowout, if you watched the game you could tell how far apart those two were and Duke was considered a title contending team that year but it wasn’t even close"
"It's not that Iggy was so good, it's that Nick Young and Quinn Cook got big minutes without him. Their wing depth was awful and it turned the series. If you have Luc and they have Iggy, the Warriors win a lot easier than they did."
I’m just saying it might not be a coincidence you guys haven’t won since Quinn Cook left
Every 2K season sim Finals matchup  You can trade Luka for Quinn Cook and the Finals will still be DAL-PHI
I miss Quinn Cook time
"My man Quinn cook got left off the bus TWICE, I call bs"
the amount of articles ive seen about the lakers waiving quinn cook is astonishing
Dudley and Quinn Cook.
Didn’t know Quinn cook is untradeable
Yeah it’s been a tough stretch.   PLEASE NO OVERTIME I’m traumatized. I’m mentally preparing to be blown out and have a whole quarter of garbage time RIP based garbage time god Quinn Cook
"Quinn Cook, Jared Dudley, Westbrook, Dennis Schrōder, Jarrett Allen"
"Yeah, it’s wild. A failure that took 4 years of fuck ups to come rearing its ugly head. I don’t mind that we got Bogut considering Cousins got injured and even when he was healthy, he wasn’t great on defense. But our priorities were all fucked when it came to roster building. Not once in the Kerr years have we had a genuine shot creator as a backup point guard. Andre and Livingston shared ball-handling duties, but Livingston only hunted shots in the post and Andre was a reluctant shooter. Quinn Cook looked really good when he came up after a Curry injury and was running pick and rolls and bombing off of the dribble and then... he never got to play that role again. And then factor in picking Jones in 2016 and Evans in 2018. Yeesh. The 2016-17 roster is also pretty fucking nuts and I think gives a window into the organization’s priorities. At one point we carried the following centers: Zaza, David West, Javale, Looney, Damian Jones, McAdoo, and Varejao. We eventually cut Varejao for Matt Barnes but we literally had 6 C’s on the roster!!! And only three of them were playable in the playoffs. The next year, we eventually trimmed the C rotation down to Looney and Bell by the WCF. I understand the value of having a vet C to soak up minutes and have been advocating the Warriors do that this year for Wiseman and Draymond’s health, but Jesus fuck. You’re telling me that McAdoo’s roster spot couldn’t have been used to find a cheap wing to develop on a multi year minimum deal?"
"They all turned out to be bad. What needs to be understood is that Kerr and the GS system can get something out of all of these guys. Look at all the players that gave us something. McKinnie, Jerebko, Bell, McCaw, Ian Clark, Quinn Cook. They all had moments with us and have done nothing since. In fact, when was the last time we dumped or traded a player that turned out to be a mistake? I can't think of any."
I think he meant Quinn cook?
Quinn Cook isn't on the Wizards.
Where's Quinn Cook these days?
Can I get an obligatory *snip snap* for Quinn Cook
Quinn Cook went from starting a finals game to 12th man on the bench the next.. 2019 Warriors were really the worst team to make the finals
I hear Quinn Cook is available
The Lakers don't have shot creators left on their roster. I guarantee Vogel would be getting roasted right now if he started trotting out Quinn Cook.
"Cmon Orlando, gimme some Quinn cook, F Chasson Randle"
My bad Quinn Cook
Two time NBA champ Quinn Cook??
"Harden has had some very good teams as well. That 65 Rockets team was a championship level team that just got injured at the wrong time. Also worth mentioning that Kawhi had the series of his life in round 2 where he was getting next to no support scoring the ball.  Either way I just think Kawhi’s scoring is more consistent while Harden’s is more volatile. Kawhi can reach Harden’s highs while hitting his lows far less often.  &gt;If CP3 was healthy in 2018, the Rockets very likely win it all. Just CP3 alone... vs the best team of all time and Harden almost won it all. Meanwhile Kawhi was a no show vs a Warriors team with Quinn Cook and Jonas Jerebko getting significant minutes  This is a weird argument. You chose the two nobodies on a team with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. And like I said he was nowhere near a no show. 28.5 ppg on 60 TS% is right there with some of Harden’s best series Harden’s ever had."
"Goes to show that his team was so good, and that Harden has had nowhere near the support that Kawhi has had.   After all, you guys won 58 games the year before and got Gasol, so Kawhi really was in the perfect situation  If CP3 was healthy in 2018, the Rockets very likely win it all. Just CP3 alone... vs the best team of all time and Harden almost won it all. Meanwhile Kawhi was a no show vs a Warriors team with Quinn Cook and Jonas Jerebko getting significant minutes"
Quinn Cook shaking in his boots
"Who you want to step up? Quinn Cook or THT? LMAO, clown take"
That was a planned pass to Quinn Cook... typa stuff only Hawkeye &amp; Lebron can do
Quinn Cook got a decent line-up
Quinn Cook is always in the background of laker videos smiling lol
"1. The guy was talking about how they were shooting at the same clip on similar attempts, not about how they got their shoots. Which is a fact.   And for your Quinn Cook comparison unsurprisingly you are wrong because they aren’t shooting  at the same attempts which is not how I defended the fact that they are shooting at similar levels.   You tried comparing  to a player that isn’t even playing..  do you understand how dumb that sounds?  Someone made a Point that 2 people are shooting the same on the same volume and your genius attempt was to compare 2 people who aren’t at all doing similar stats?"
"So you’re currently a coach ignoring context? We always stats facts without context: It’s a fact Quinn Cook is better than Klay Thompson. He’s scoring more points, more assists and more 3’a. It doesn’t matter context, it’s a literal fact. See how funny that sounds?  How you gonna be a coach and not see the amazing attention Robinson provides from the defense?"
"Even after Klay went down, game 6 came down to warriors having final possession with 8 seconds left down 1 and Curry missing that 3 to effectively lose the game. Are you saying that the warriors couldn't have made up that difference if they weren't starting that 4th quarter with the husk of Cousins and Livingston, Jerebko, and Quinn Cook?"
"Even after Klay went down, game 6 came down to warriors having final possession with 8 seconds left down 1 and Curry missing that 3 to effectively lose the game.  Are you saying that the warriors couldn't have made up that difference if they weren't starting that 4th quarter with the husk of Cousins and Livingston, Jerebko, and Quinn Cook?"
"Oooh, that struck a nerve. It’s a fact that both AD and Schroeder are out right now. Also that most of our non-AD games came against bottom feeding teams. You a casual if you think we matched up well from the jump, or that you can pat yourself on the back this much from a game where *Quinn Cook* played meaningful minutes for the first time this season."
"Then explain Quinn Cook, Kyle Kuzma, KCP, Rajon Rondo, last year all getting more votes than players way way way better than them??  It's literally a popularity contest."
Lol Dennis and AD out.. cmon be better don’t overreact when Quinn cook was getting mins in the second quarter
"Plus NBA Champs JR Smith, JaVale McGee and Quinn Cook  Damn that team was stacked, haven't even mentioned Antetokounmpo yet"
Quinn Cook is going to carry the Lakers to this comeback.
Andre Robertson is CLAMPING. It was quinn cook but who cares
Quinn Cook locking up Kyrie and Harden simultaneously
"Quinn Cook is getting significant minutes, I’m not going to overreact. But if Lakers play like this next game against the Nets they’re gonna lose again, AD can’t fix this"
Bummer game with this lineup. You know something’s off when Quinn Cook is playing this early
"Come on Vogel, what is this?  Quinn Cook? Might as well throw in Cacok and McKinnie"
Secret weapon Quinn Cook is in
Quinn cook in the 2nd quarter??? GG Nets
You know the offense is that bad when Quinn Cook is playing
"that's disingenuous. They traded 40 million worth of role players and bench for 40 million of KD. When KD goes down, that's 40 million worth of player value down the drain that's not made up for.  It's clear as day in 2016 GSW had reliable options to pass to for 3 and in 2019 all the shooting and scoring burden was focused on KD and Steph and Klay. They were starting Quinn Cook and Alfonso McKinnie in the finals for gods sake.  And people saying Iggy and Livingston clearly didn't watch the series. iggy averaged 3 points a game and didn't even play the 4th game. Livingston averaged 5 points."
"bro if i see quinn cook in the game in non-garbage time minutes, I'm just gonna turn the game off."
Quinn Cook with that single vote.
"Draymond spoke for a little over 2 minutes and not once did he ask for a rule change. What he’s asking for is that front offices across the league get their shit together. Danny Green went on JJ Redick’s podcast and praised the Lakers for how  they handled his trade this past offseason, and Quinn Cook had similar remarks about being waved by them. You misconstrued Draymond’s very first sentence, where he talks about seeing Andre Drummond begin his pre-game warmup then return from the locker room in street clothes because he had only just then been informed that he was being held out.   I think Draymond stumbled a bit when he brought up Harden because the heat Harden took was less about his trade request and more about the fact that the organization bent over backwards to put a winning team around him, shuffling in one all star after another and constructing the roster specifically around his offensive talents, all for him to say “we’re not good enough” when the reality is that he’s been underachieving. But even then, the fallout from his trade request was something Houston’s FO anticipated. The GM was quoted as having said “We’re prepared for things to get uncomfortable” and that’s what happened.   Draymond overall point is that there’s a right way to do these things, and when an organization fumbles away a player’s prime years-or even when they don’t and they just wanna trade that player for whatever reason there’s a way to go about it. When Harrison Barnes was traded mid game LeBron spoke up about it that very night on Twitter. There was no reason the team’s broadcasting crew should know before the player. Maybe you call that player before he leaves for the game and tell him he’s being held out because you’re close on a trade? Maybe you tell DeMarcus Cousins before he leaves town for AS Weekend and that you’re working towards trading him and hope to have something done by the weekend? There’s a right way to do this sort of thing and that’s what separates first class organizations from the rest of the pack. That’s what Draymond was talking about."
"Did you watch this game? Shamet and Johnson were throwing up 3's to try and break the record every single possession and none of the garbage time Kings players were in.  Like you realize when the game was actually a game the Nets bench was actually good right (and has been since the Pacers game)? Also this has happened like once before. Vs the Knicks. Who we were also blowing out. The thing in common is opposing coaches being hard asses and instead of throwing in the towel, forcing their young players to play the game out 48 minutes as some sort of lesson or something. This is literally something we don't ever have to worry about. Also it's not like Kyrie was running around exerting effort, he walked the ball up to half court, got double teamed, and passed it to Shamet.  Uhh did you watch the Durant Warriors or Heatles? The Warriors had Dray and Iggy, then straight garbage, guys like Bell, McKinnie, Jerebko, Quinn Cook. Did you watch the Finals two years ago, once Klay and KD went down the Raptors ran a box and one because the other Warriors were such garbage and thats WITH Steph and Dray on the floor.  The Heatles had like Battier and Allen, but the rest was garbage, they brought Birdman out of retirement, James Jones and Mike Miller who literally could only shoot 3's, nothing else, Rashard Lewis who wasn't shit without PEDs."
It ain't a Laker blowout is Quinn Cook isn't dribbling at the end
You'll get Quinn Cook and you'll like it.
Wanamaker is making me wish we had Quinn Cook back /shudders
"Part of that is because Curry can shoot to threaten at any moment so they need to respect it by staying close, he also has one of the best handles of all time. Also Steph is 6'3, big difference vs 6'0 guys like Quinn Cook."
"Quinn Cook only started because of injuries, it took two games for Kerr to roll with a no-PG lineup and finish that series off  Cook has always been a massive defensive liability and he'll never get real minutes because his offensive peak is being streaky"
He definitely did not. Dudley didn’t get much of any playing time but his role as a practice player and locker room presence was invaluable.  Cousins got hurt before the season started so was never active for any official regular season team practices or anything like that. Not to mention he got waived soon after the injury.  It’s a nice gesture but there’s no way he contributed anything near what Dudley or Quinn Cook did.
Comparing him and Quinn Cook... which one is better? Quinn Cook literally started in the playoffs but is now the garbage time squad on the Lakers
We’ll give you Quinn Cook for Jayson Tatum
"Averaged 30 in 2019 in a series where the warriors were playing guys like Alfonso mckinnie and quinn cook, g league players. Set the record for most 3s in a series in 2018, averaged 27 and 8 and 8 in 2017. Context matters yes. So do stats."
"Is this because the Warriors have never really had a true “6th man” PG since Curry’s 1st MVP year? They had a number of high-IQ players like Livingston and Iggy, but they always lacked a solid playmaking guard to run the offense without Steph. Green is a great playmaker, but his lack of scoring limits his effectiveness without Curry (last season is a great example of this).  KD had the 3rd most assists on the team while he was there. Before that, maybe it was Quinn Cook?  Steph is one of the best offensive players of all time, but there is some confounding going on with a lot of these numbers (not just his) imo."
"For perspective, NBA superstars Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker carried there Wisconsin team to an NCAA championship where they lost to a squad of absolute league legends Jahlil Okafor, Justice Winslow, Tyus Jones, and Quinn Cook."
He left Quinn Cook behind at the arena?
"What do you think of Cook? Lol McLemore is playable, Quinn isn’t."
That should make you reevaluate your position on Quinn Cook.
We cut Quinn Cook for this?
"2019 Warriors were worse too, did you not see we were playing Quinn Cook out there while you guys had Austin Rivers?   &gt; cut the bullshit  Yeah a player is totally injury free when his finger is dislocated and a few games back from an MCL sprain in a playoff setting."
"Same core of big 3 went to Finals while giving minutes to Quinn Cook, McKinnie. Wont be contending LMAO!"
"I think the tough part with ""what-ifs"" is that it can go both ways.   If Iggy wasn't out for 4 games, would the series even of go 7 games?   Im not saying CP3 wasnt a bigger loss then iggy, but Warriors lost game 4 and 5 by 3pts and 4 pts respectively. If Iggy was playing you cant tell me he couldnt contribute 3pts worth of value over nick Young, jordan bell or Quinn Cook.    That being said, the chris Paul injury was huge. That was such a great rivalry and series that it sucks that not everyone was at full strength.   Additionally, I  think the harden/CP3 rockets would of smashed the Cavs, and are one of the greatest teams  of all time who didn't win the championship."
reminds me of Quinn Cook after last year's finals :/
"fr brotha. Ppl not realize we had McKinnie, Jerebko, Quinn Cook, Jordan Bell out out here playing minutes. Huge diff team wise lol, and we ran Curry Klay Dray and KD minutes wise into the ground to make up for our depth."
"Nobody on that Raptors team is on LeBron’s level, not even Kawhi lol.  The Raptors struggled vs a worse Warriors squad playing the ghosts of Bogut, Boofie, and Livingston, with dudes like Quinn Cook and Alfonzo McKinnie getting big minutes"
Top-loaded teams like the Nets and Lakers are going to inherently need more from the buyout market than teams like the Jazz and Suns who've both got relatively deep teams and strong defensive identities. It's also a huge gamble to wait and hope that good players get bought out and that they want to come to your team. The Warriors were banking on buyouts in 2019 to fill out a depleted roster but didn't get any players worth playing so Quinn Cook and Alfonzo McKinnie were serious rotation players for them. If Blake and LMA didn't get bought out then the Nets could have been going into the playoffs with a fairly shallow roster.
So any player that is waived during the season shouldn't be able to sign with a team over the cap. Quinn Cook shouldn't have been able to sign with the Cavs for example?
And Quinn Cook dribbles out the game clock.
"I'm comparing the effect of rings in legacy, and if Ar&gt; A because he has more rings, then A &gt; B because he has more rings.  Quin Cook has a better legacy than Harden or Giannis if the utmost achievement of a player is rings as here presented.  Horry is even better than Jordan since I am not just looking at him better, dude has 7 rings (regardless of importance or MPG in said finals).  I would look at a player just the same as I did before , Dwight remains the human with the biggest wingspan 've seen i my life, a 3X DPOY.. and a man that got a ring after 10?? Or so different teams in his twilight.  In short , rings obtained by players riding the bench &lt;&gt; rings obtained being the main man of your team.  For example, as of today Embiid is a better player to me than Quinn Cook will ever be."
"we got to witness one of the greatest teams of all time and the team was built by good drafting and one FA signing. they played great team defense and moved the ball better than any offense ever  as a non-warriors fan, i didnt care about them winning, and i like parity more. as a basketball fan though, it was fun as fuck to watch that warriors squad. we might never see anything like it again  after kd and klay went down, the finals were garbage. that ‘19 series was trash, we watched the raptors beat steph and quinn cook after KD torched them in the 30 minutes he played"
Maybe he should have joined Quinn Cook somewhere then since they grew up as really good friends. All KD's friend happen to be allstars.
It’s not. That team was forced to play Jonas Jerekbo and Quinn Cook significant minutes. You’d basically be swapping Iggy and Livingston for Wiggins and Oubre while the rest of the team remains around the same level
"Oubre is 10x the player McKinnie is, Paschall is better than Jerebko/Bell, Poole is better than Quinn Cook, all those dudes played huge minutes in 2019  The biggest difference is losing Andre, but we’d gain Wiggins and he could probably give us 40 minutes, rather than Andre’s 30."
"I’m gonna go against the grain and say the Dubs might win in 7.  They were close to taking them to 7 already, and they had Quinn Cook, McKinnie, Jerebko and a retiring Livingston playing huge minutes. I don’t see why those holes couldn’t be filled by Oubre, Poole, Paschall etc. It’s at least not that much worse.  The biggest loss would be Andre, but Wiggins playing in that role has been solid defensively. He would also probably give us more than 9.2 points, but we’d lose the playmaking of Andre.  Idk, the bench is terrible, but the 2019 Warriors were missing a huge amount of money in KD, and were having to rely on an already injured Boogie."
"This supporting cast is way better than that year's outside of Iguodala. Shaun Livingston, Bogut were totally washed, Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook and Jordan Bell were not NBA level players. Marquese Chriss is better than whatever Boogie was that year. We'd basically be starting Oubre and Wiggins over McKinnie/Bell/Jerebko  Guys like Mannion, Wiseman, Poole probably wouldn't play much in a finals game when the rotations shorten. Steph would likely play closer to 40+ minutes instead of his usual 36. Raptors still win in 7 though"
I'm both laughing and crying. I miss Quinn cook too
I miss Quinn Cook. He would have dribbled hard and shoot in the face of these 10day contract jabronis
"? Not on the 2nd unit. He was the point guard. It was always Livingston + Barbosa/Ian Clark/Quinn Cook, Klay, Iggy, and a backup big. And no one runs pick and roll on the Warriors lol, it barely factors into the offense."
Is he related to Quinn Cook? If he is he'll be a killer lock room presence probably.
"He always seems to squeeze the most out of bench players in the playoffs. I'm sure a lot of it in the past had to do with playing w/ an all-star starting line-up and 6th man, but the 2018-2019 playoffs when the team started dying one by one showed how he could still keep things from completely imploding playing end of bench guys like Quinn Cook, McKinnie, Jerebko in the NBA Finals lol."
"I looked at the roster to refresh my memory, and damn...  In order of total minutes played: Mario Chalmers, Udonis Haslem, (rookie) Michael Beasley, Daequan Cook, (pretty washed) Shawn Marion, Joel Anthony, Chris Quinn, Yakhouba Diawara, (pretty washed) Jermaine O'Neal, Jamaal Magliore, Jamario Moon, James Jones..."
I wonder if management is friendly between the teams because of Bron. They seem to get a lot of deals done together.   I'm hoping Quinn Cook can have the Jordan Clarkson story arc!
He was the one that left Quinn Cook behind at the arena
"That's fine, except Quinn Cook cannot really ball handle or run an offense. He is the quintessential undersized shooting guard who chucks up a shot everytime he has the ball."
2x NBA Champion Quinn Cook
"Quinn Cook and Frank Mason leads the league in “fuck we don’t have any ball handlers, let’s just get a guy who can for a couple games I guess” contracts"
"Curry also dropped 47 on the box-and-1. It was helpful, but as you mentioned, the biggest factor was lack of depth offensively.   Starting Livingston, Cousins, Iggy, and Dray then having Quinn Cook, washed Bogut, and McKinnie off the bench is not ideal for a Finals game."
"Quinn Cook and McKinnie, come home too"
"Nick Young isn't a Kerr type of player but he was there when we needed him. He stepped up in the moment, Quinn Cook on the other hand..."
"&gt; You had 4 allstars and you’re wining about a role player  First off, it's spelt *whining. Second, Iggy was our best perimeter defender that year, so he was put on Harden which meant Klay could be put on CP3, and Dray could work either against Capela or Tucker depending on who was out there. It also meant we had four guys out there with Steph who could help and switch. Once Iggy went down, that screwed up the defensive gameplan. Looney and Young had to play more minutes, and they aren't exactly guys I wanted defending Harden or CP3 on a switch.  &gt; Absolutely comparable  Luc played 13 mpg and was only out for game 7. Iggy played 27 and was hurt after game 3. Luc was the 8th man in your rotation. Iggy started. Heck, Gerald Green played more minutes than Luc.  &gt; LRMAM was our best and most versatile defender the entire season  Um, what? You had Tucker, Ariza and CP3 (though I'll concede Luc probably could defend more positions than the latter). That's like saying Quinn Cook was our third best offensive option."
the last 5 turnovers I've seen have all been THT... I feel like we're really missing Quinn Cook or something as a better backup PG
"&gt; When were these players starting in the Finals?  I guess you can't just look it up. Jordan Bell, who played in the G League this year and has been bouncing around on 10 day contracts started Game 1.  Shaun Livingston who was a shell of himself averaging 4ppg that year and retired after the series, started game 3 (and went 1-4 in that game).  Demarcus Cousins, who tore his quad earlier in the playoffs, started 3 games clearly hobbled but he was literally the only true center on the roster at that point and the Warriors needed size against Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka. Cousins ended up averaging 8 ppg on an abysmal 45 eFG%.  Quinn Cook and Alfonzo McKinnie played 20+ minutes in several games. Both were G League players the Warriors picked up. Cook is no longer in the league and McKinnie is riding the Lakers bench scoring 3 ppg.   Looney played well in the playoffs but in Game 2 he fractured his ribs, missed game 3, and was hampered by this injury for the rest of the series.   &gt;You were not coming back to win shit.  I don't know why you think I believe the Warriors were coming back. This point is basically a non-sequiter. I said the Warriors faced a huge talent disparity between their injuries and lack of roster depth. They were absolutely not a great team without KD and the other guys that missed games. They were extremely top heavy and with injuries to KD, Klay, Iguodala, Cousins, and Looney, they had no chance in the series."
"It’s not the literal police… he wasn’t close to being as good as a Steph jumper off a screen or a Gobert P&amp;R, and I’m not sure why we should feel the need to defend hyperbole.    Again, though, that doesn’t really have anything to do with the fact that comparing his iso to team’s isos just doesn’t make any sense to do.  Why do I care if Harden is better than a dataset that includes Jordan Bell and Damion Lee and Quinn Cook?   The comparison just doesn’t make logical sense."
"The Warriors were starting literal G League players. Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, Jordan Bell, a completely broken down Shaun Livingston, a broken Cousins, Looney was injured and Iguodala had a bad back. The talent disparity was huge."
Why does Steph need to focus on Quinn Cook?
Quinn Cook jumping in on this is so hilarious lmao
"Jordan bell, Quinn cook, McCaw, fetus ezili  alll bay area unsung heroes."
"&gt;Name these players. If you’re including dudes like JTA or Quinn Cook or Jerebko or Casspi or Nick Young it’s just comical.  Why, exactly, would that be comical?  Players not named Curry, Thompson, or Durant took about half of the Warriors' threes except in '18 and '19, when they fell to around 40%."
Quinn Cook won us games a few times.
"Name these players. If you’re including dudes like JTA or Quinn Cook or Jerebko or Casspi or Nick Young it’s just comical.  He’s had 2 years of legitimate spacing &amp; that’s 2014-16. Every other year was just top heavy spacing with him, Klay &amp; KD. Rest of the 14 man roster was basically non threats from 3."
He's this seasons Quinn Cook
so is it all a troll or just the Quinn Cook
"curry, kyrie, Lillard, cp3, Harden if you wanna call him a point guard, Quinn cook just to start"
"I mean, the Raptors did it but we had quinn cook out there as the only other shooter. And he didn't do anything with that space anyways.   If Damion Lee and Oubre play, we have 5 guys who can knock down open shots (Lee, Oubre, Wigs, Poole, Bazemore, kinda JTA). Hopefully then the 3v4s actually work out after Steph is doubled"
whatchu mean bro?? alfonzo mckinnie and quinn cook are absolute cheat codes out there
Quinn cook n j Cole
"It was just Curry, Dray, and Boogie lol. Quinn cook was getting minutes. Unless your assuming they’re healthy which defeats the point of the question"
Throwback to the finals where he threw it out of bounds then got really mad at Quinn Cook.
"I dont think thats a fair way to judge it. When Curry was out Quinn Cook started for him. KD got replaced by iggy, thats a huge difference. Not to mention the team was built around Curry."
Quinn of House Cook
quinn cook is always forgotten lol
Quinn Cook
Quinn Cook
Do you not understand the difference on how the Raptors guarded Curry vs Klay? They played a box and 1 on him in the finals and had lineups where Curry's best shooter was Quinn Cook. And he still averaged 30.
"I wouldn't call us favorites.  I'm sure Draymond can get back to form in the playoffs, and Klay's recovery is going just as well as KD's did from a medical standpoint.  I expect all 3 of our guys to be on that level.  But we had a lot of really important extra pieces.  Bogut, Lee, Barbosa, Livingston, Iggy, West, and even our one trick pony shooters Ian Clark and Quinn Cook.  We had depth and a roster that totally fit.  Wiseman is the most physically talented big we've had since...well, one year of Chris Webber.  But he's not the fit and he's raw as hell.  Jordan Poole is still inconsistent, but very talented.  Wiggins has become a great fit.  Everyone else is on the chopping block, and although we have assets to make a move for what we need, there's no guarantee we'll get it.  Our roster needs some serious changes before we're really contenders, but it is nice to see Curry put the fear in people before Klay comes back."
"Same I wonder why? Guards with a bare amount of skill tend to fly off the market mid-season. Remember how fast Quinn Cook was signed or even how IT got a team before Rivers?  Don’t think I’ve ever seen a guard make it this long post-buyout, maybe it was him being picky?"
"I'll stand with and believe in Bron until the day he shows me signs that he's actually on the decline, or the day he retires after next year's finals.   It's the rest of that team, the guys not named LeBron, Quinn, Kentavious, or Anthony I'm not so certain of. #1 D, great. The king plus a top ~x sidekick who's a monster, superb. Quinn Cook as the secret game 7 4th quarter ace, fire.   The rest? Idk."
"&gt;Because they have more talent to account for a missing role player then a team with only 2 stars does? The fuck?  Again, that's not how it works at all. The Warriros big 4 would play the same minutes regardless of Iguodala's health. What a ridiculous argument.  &gt;Looney was playing great defense the entire time, I don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re making it so abundantly clear that you didn’t watch this matchup and it’s hilarious   He was good for a big, but ultimately Harden and CP3 especially were able to get lots of easy baskets with him and Bell guarding them. There was a stretch in game 5 where CP3 was picking on Looney for several plays in a row. Obviously Iguodala is a huge upgrade over Looney lol.    &gt;They were using looney and bell as screeners. It’s not like they ran the small ball lineup the entire fucking time, they would use looney a ton. And we were switching   Exactly, they were switching, which forced the Warriros to play Iso ball. but whenever Curry and Duramt went to Iso, Bell and Looney clogged up the spacing. There were numerous times that Curry and KD would drive to the rim and have nowhere to go because Looney and especially Bell where just standing there in no man's land.  &gt;LRMAM makes our small ball lineup better.  Perhaps, but Golden State couldn't even play small without Iguodala. They tried for like 5 minutes combined in 2 games, but Quinn Cook and Swaggy P were awful. They played big most of the time.  &gt;No they didn’t, harden had his best game of the series with iggy on him lmao. Harden played poorly later on because he was missing his stepbacks.  He wasn't getting those shots up over Iguodala for the most part. He was mismatch hunting. Harden would not only miss those same stepbacks and more with Iguodala there instead of Looney and Bell, but he would also have a much tougher time getting to the rim.  &gt;Yes, that is how it fucking works, they both had equal importance to there teams. In  No they did not. I have already explained why. The Warriors abandoned their entire small ball strategy, whereas Houston replaced LRMAM's minutes with better players. Fatigue and a bit of defense doesn't compare to a huge strategic shift.   &gt;In the games LRMAM did play against golden state healthy in the regular season he played great and we won  Regular season my friend. Playoffs are a different beast.  &gt;They didn’t have to compromise shit, they had 2 MVPS and 2 all stars and you’re talking about “compromise” for a 6 PPG 37 year old LOL. We  This is some terrible basketball analysis. You are literally trying to argue that Houston was a better team even with fewer MVPS and All Stars. Surely you can see that simply counting the All Stars is a silly way to compare teams. And counting Iguodala's ppg also shows you didn't watch those Warriors teams at all. It is blatantly obvious that Iguodala was more important to the Warriors, not just because he is a better player than LRMAM, but also because of roster fit, and the fact that he was the only 3 and d type of player they could play alongside the  big 4. Sacrificing strategy, spacing, playmaking, and defense is a bigger blow than sacrificing a small amount of defense and some fatigue to role players. Sorry, but Houston lost in 2018 and can't hide behind excuses, as they would have lost anyway if both teams were healthy."
"End of game 5 with ended which the next possession ended with Quinn Cook of all people taking what turned out to be the most important shot of the 2018 season, because CP3 was injured and couldn’t get down to the other side of the court."
"Yeah I have to disagree with almost all of that lol  Mckinnie was bought out and is the 15th man on the roster for the Lakers right now. He started for the Warriors in the 2019 finals. Bell was out of the league 4 months ago, and the warriors signed him a two way for the season because they moved JTA to the roster. He started much of 2018-19. Quinn cook is now not in the nba and played 20 mpg in 2019 out of necessity of Klay and Durant being hurt.   No one is arguing that CP3 is better/more important than Igoudala. I’m saying both healthy warriors are simply better  I don’t include Love much as part of injuries, because the Cavs overall played better without him whenever they played the warriors. It was a blessing in disguise in 2016, as Jefferson and Jr, Shumpert played better than Love.   I wasn’t arguing the Draymond suspension. Counting fouls is not indicative of how the game was reffed, I didn’t think I would need to explain that.   For the most part, the warriors did run through the playoffs, and the only reason why they didn’t even further was injuries, yeah. The reason is that when everyone in the nba is healthy, the Warriors benefitted the most, because they were the best team so it didn’t matter if the other teams were healthy"
"Jerebko played in the NBA until he was 32. Quinn Cook played this past season. Bell is still on a two-way contract. Alfonzo McKinnie is still in the league. Looney is still in the league. Zaza, David West, and Livingston all retired. I’m not arguing that the bench was ungodly, but you’re point that the bench isn’t in the league even though they’re “in their primes” is simply incorrect.   Iguodala played 3 games. And losing Iguodala at that point wasn’t nearly as important as the Rockets losing CP3.   Losing a star player if you have two isn’t less of a big deal just because you have a better replacement player to put in. 1 All Star + a decent bench player isn’t better than 2/3 All Stars + a bad-to-average bench player. And it’s not like the Cavs bench was full of studs. Lebron losing Kevin Love for the whole series and Kyrie after game 1 is MUCH worse than the Warriors missing Iguodala for four games against the Rockets or missing Draymond for one game of the finals lmfao. The only year Golden State got fucked by injuries was against Toronto.   If you’re just going to use the “rigged” argument, I don’t know what to tell you. Draymond earned and deserved his suspension. Both teams were called for the same numbers of fouls, and the free throw disparity was 3. It wasn’t a close game. The Warriors scored 11 points in the first quarter. How exactly did the refs make that happen? It’s not like it came down to a last minute possession. Warriors got whooped.   The best team on paper doesn’t always win the championship. You’re acting like the Warriors just ran through the playoffs with no struggles for five years, and that didn’t happen."
Quinn Cook
"Lol all the Rockets had to do was win one game. KD was also out with score tied or Warriors behind in the 4th of game 5. Warriors didnt have Iguodala without whom they struggle to play their small ball lineups and no bench the next year. You lost to a team of Jordan Bell, Kevon Looney and Quinn Cook the next year."
Lol having Klay shooting the corner 3s instead of Alfonzo McKinnie and Quinn Cook probably changes the series a lot.
"You know you have a super team when you gotta talk about the guy on the bench playing 12 minutes a game to try to find nonsuperstars on your team. Was the KD, Curry, Green, Klay GSW team not a superteam because Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, and Kevon Looney getting minutes off the bench in the playoffs?"
Quinn Cook his ass and just leave him there
Was it Quinn Cook that always used to use a long abbreviation that was never explained in all of his tweets?
"Quinn Cook. He would post RiP DAD! At the end of all his posts even if it was like a happy thing so some shit like “LOVING MY SQUAD, PURPLE N GOLD FOREVER RIP DAD!”"
"That’s because lebron’s playstyle isn’t suited for player development because at this point in his career, he can do it all. But just because he can do it all, doesn’t mean that he should. He needs established role players that are already developed in order to flourish. Like, look at last year. He had Dwight, KCP, Javale McGee, Rondo, Quinn Cook, and Danny Green, which most would agree is a solid supporting cast. Losing most of those guys was a huge blow for the lakers success and their replacements haven’t been able to match their success. Plus mans is already 36, he simply doesn’t have time to develop young players"
quinn cook maybe? asked for jared dudleys number because it was his late fathers number and said RIP DAD in the tweet which looked weird but he actually just ended all social media posts with that.
I mean you could just use Lebron and any player from 2019 to the same effect.  Crazy we’ll have a finals without Lebron and Quinn Cook for the first time since 2010
"Didnt Leonard score 30 in a half in one of those games? IIRC Warriors were playing Alfonso Mckinnie, Jordan Bell and Quinn cook major minutes that series. Was a close series but I dont think Id call that team a deserving WCF, although I dont think Dame is the problem."
Quinn cook?
Those guys along with Quinn Cook were absolute bench monsters. Then they brought JR into the mix? Chaos
AD gets a bus. Quinn Cook gets left by the bus
Source - Quinn cook who also missed the bus but by accident
"He's like Quinn Cook and Benny Mac, one trick pony that sucks at everything else and isn't even super reliable at shooting"
Lebron bout to forget KCP like they forgot Quinn Cook in the bubble
"Mulder reminds me a lot of Quinn Cook. Literally only a shooter, but even that skill disappears in the clutch. They can help you win a few ehh regular season games, but as soon as it matters they disappear."
"Even in the 2019 Finals it was bad.  Outside of the main guys (and obviously KD basically didn't play), you had older/less effective Iguodala and Livingston, Cousins, Looney, Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, washed Andrew Bogut, Jonas Jerebko, Jordan Bell, Jacob Evans, Damian Jones...  Remove KD and Klay from when they were hurt and it was not good."
Tell em to pick up quinn cook cause I'll take him over dennis
"&gt; He was about to unleash Linsanity 2.0  Probably why he isn’t in the league.  It’s pretty unlikely that he could be a lead guard, but it sounds like he still thinks of himself that way. “Just need one chance and I will blow it out of the water.”  Teams aren’t looking for 32 year old lead guards with a chip on their shoulder in the g-league. They are looking for youth or vets that can fill a role.  And I mean, he might not even be good enough to fill that role. Quinn Cook, Austin Rivers, Tim Frazier are a few of the guards who signed 10 day contracts in the last month or so. Is Lin better than any of those players at this point in his career?"
"Steph/Klay/KD far too good. You can throw in 2 of Livingston, Ian Clark, Casspi, Quinn Cook depending depending on the year for those Warriors teams but for sure the best shooting lineup is the one with the two GOAT shooters  Edit: Can also include Damion Lee as needed for 18/19 warriors"
"Warriors made him look better than he was, guys like him and Quinn Cook are borderline NBA players who didn't show much once they left."
"below replacement value players that have been through the Warrior's system and been ""serviceable"":  Ian Clark   James Michael McAdoo   Alonzo McKinnie   Damian Jones   Festus Ezeli   Quinn Cook   Patrick McCaw   Damion Lee   Mychal Mulder   Brandon Rush   Justin Holiday    Others who thrive in the Warriors system that may not look as good somewhere else:  Kevon Looney   Shaun Livingston   Juan T."
"&gt; LeBron’s 2nd man on the 07 Cavs was Z   LeBron's first stint with the Cavs was focused on a defensive core - Larry Hughes 2005 all defensive, Gooden 2003 all rookie, Big Z was a 2x all star,  Varejao already a good defender by 2005, Eric Snow 2003 all defensive, etc. In 2009 LeBron's team had both offense and defense, the team shot 41% from 3 excluding LeBron which would be insane even by today's standards.   We were giving Quinn Cook, Jerebko, and McKinnie legitimate minutes in the finals against Siakam/ Gasol/ Kawhi / Lowry / FVV."
Quinn Cook has felt this power
"You’re complaining about having to use solid vets? The rest of the teams in the league make do with whatever they have and don’t make no excuses. Even Quinn Cook, your 15th man, ran our offense and got 20ppg when Curry was out. Don’t act like you don’t have options"
"First and foremost Klay Thompson. Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, Shaun Livingston, Nick Young, Kevon Looney, Quinn Cook, Jordan Bell, Zaza Pachulia, Patrick McCaw"
"Still mad they dumped him for fucking Pat McCaw’s shitty ass. It was so that Quinn Cook could return, but the reality of it was McCaw returned from injury to play another 15 career min for the Dubs that year, and he was trash af while Casspi offered a really nice complementary role off the bench. Dumb ass decision though we won that year and McCaw walked anyway."
"Apart from Klay and KD, who else? Quinn Cook?"
"Wizards got all the PG County boys let’s gooooooo. KD, Oladipo, Uncle Jeff Green, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Markelle Fultz, Quinn Cook, the list goes on."
"Klay was on track to winning finals mvp. They win game 6 if he doesn’t get hurt. The warriors next man up was Quinn cook lol. Klay was on fire the whole series. Look at his shooting percentages for the finals and his clutch performance in game 3, game 5 game 6."
"He's doing a great job of playing off ball and within the flow of the offense, rather than starting with the ball on the perimeter and trying to shove it down their throat. It's much harder to game-plan for that, as committing an extra player to a guy who doesn't even have the ball yet is basically insanity unless there's literally no one else you're afraid of (see the box and 1 against Curry in 2019. Worked because the Warriors' second best shooter by then was Quinn Cook)."
Youre forgetting 2x champion Quinn Cook
"the raptors werent that good, i dont get all of you guys. by record, personnel, winning%, net rating (where suns were .4 better), the suns and raps were almost identical across the board.   The warriors without KD were curry, klay, iggy, draymond, bogut, looney, livingston, jordan bell, quinn cook, and alfonzo mckinnie. Half those guys were out of the league within a season. One of the top-heaviest rosters ever without their best player. Stop pretending the raps beat some goliath. It took the healthy raps 6 games, one where even klay didnt play, the other klay didnt play the 4th quarter and the raps won by 4. It's fucking ridiculous how much you all are defending that team, they simply were not that great."
"It literally was. The ""kd and klayless warriors that would slap this suns team"" lineup would have been curry, quinn cook, iggy, draymond, and kevon looney, with alfonzo mckinnie,  jordan bell, boogie, and livingston (averaging 4 pts/game in the playoffs) coming off the bench. Please shut the fuck up."
Quinn Cook is the rich kid
That’s Quinn Cook lol
2nd to Quinn cook
"Depth plays a big factor in this. The Grizzlies are agreed upon as a bottom 3 all time team, but they have Conley/Ja on the court for 48 minutes. That’s a lot better than having to play 8-10 minutes of Delly/old Mo Williams/Quinn Cook/even Shaun Livingston. They also have at least one Gasol out there at all times. Throw in 5-6 really good wings that can play in different scenarios: Battier/Eddie Jones/Mike Miller/Shareef Abdur-Rahim/Tony Allen/Gay. I don’t think it’s as cut and dry as everyone else does."
Quinn Cook
"It’s dumb to me, like you look at the hawks this year or even the raptors 2019 szn.. they could withstand guys going down with injury cause of depth.  Sure they may not have as much top end talent, but if that top end talent is unavailable and you are relying on Quinn cook.. That is your fault.  And when you don’t have depth you use those stars more and don’t load manage throughout the season because your team would lose more games and seeding.. that’s your roster construction"
Let Quinn Cook
Quinn Cook to the Lakers confirmed!
Which is why that finals was hard to watch Quinn cook and Alphonso McKinnie play big minutes lol
Having watched Vogel these last two years I think he just trusts defensive minded players more than guys like Quinn Cook. It worked last year. But Lebron + shooters also produced the greatest playoff offence ever so that also works.
"You mean the Nba finalist team?   who played vs a 2018 Warriors with an average of 29.4 with players who actually played (majority of minutes played were ages 28,30,30,29,28,33, 34 and j bell who was 23)   mccaw and quinn cook who were 25 and 23 barely saw the court, same with zaza who was 34.  The 2018 Rockets playoff team was much older than reported Game 1 average age vs Warriors was 30.9  if you strip it to starters or major contributors its 30.4  PJ Tucker 33  Ariza 32  Paul 33  Harden 28   Capela 24  Green 32  Gordon 30   30.3 ^     2/7 players fit your prime narrative. But if they didnt have a hamstring injury they likely beat the Warriors here in 7. Not having a prime 33 year old CP3 lost them the series etc  2019 average age of key players was Raptors - 29 Warriors 30.1  The Average of the Lakers core 9 contributors last year? 30   Rondo 34, Davis 27, Lebron 35, Howard 34 D Green, 33/34, KCP 27, Morris 30, Kuzma 24, Caruso 26  Honestly is an inexperienced 26 year old even in his prime yet?"
"But you said it yourself. It's all about how much defensive attention you command.  Steph and Trae play 2 very different types of systems. As soon as Trae crosses half court, he's gonna either spam the pnr or run like crazy to the hoop. The defense will always stay on him and his great passing will reward his open teammates. Trae shreds defenses and smells bbq chicken whenever there is an opening. His quick release allows him to pull the floater or hit from deep as soon as an occasion arises. This is how I perceive his game, although he has much more to offer than just that (ball handling, leadership,..).  Steph's playmaking isn't solely him having a basketball and making the right pass. His juking, cutting and even having his heads up is going to tear defenders apart. The decision making and reaction time he has while having to run  miles through screens and making the right moves is what makes his offball movement so deadly. I can't recall how many open lanes he created when he had a decent supporting cast. Iggy, Bell, Shaun, Oubre, Dray, Wiggs and KD have had wide open looks just because Steph decided to cut right instead of left. Most off ball shooters can't even see 3 plays ahead after they get their screen and receive the ball. Steph will get the attention of both defenders coming off a screen and will still find the open roller with bodies in front of him. If this isn't feel for the game, I don't know what it is. Don't just look for the raw stat, because Steph has transcended raw analytics. His decision making isn't bad off ball either. A guy that runs all game while being quadruple teamed and still drops 47 (with Quinn Cook as his 2nd offensive option vs the raptors) is more impressive for me than another who drops one more point without facing double coverage most of the time."
"We could have had Curry and all those guys. Curry (4yr/$32m) would have taken the place of Avery Bradley (2yr/$10m) and Quinn Cook (2yr/$6m), neither of whom contributed to our playoff run."
"Kevon Looney over Quinn Cook any day of the week, is Quinn still in the league (legit question)?   Also I would definitely think Norm has a bigger impact than Trez (and probably Kelly) but it’s not that huge of a gap."
Let’s not forget Lakers legend Quinn Cook commenting RiP DAD! on every post
"That 2019 Warriors team did *not* have a deep bench. Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, Jonas Jerebko, Jordan Bell 🤮"
"The homie Quinn Cook  Peak Steph, Klay, KD, Dray, Bron and AD"
"IIRC Frazier is AD's teammate from NO, probably why that's happening... if they're gonna go that route they might as well bring back quinn  cook"
"[Nah, Quinn Cook](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eA3J_HABycs)"
I absolutely thought that Quinn Cook was gonna hit that three point shot when he was wide open with 40 seconds left. Luckily he missed and Gordo hit that shot
Dude Steph got box and 1-ed for half the finals because their second best offensive player was Quinn Cook
Damn Quinn cook really started a finals game. Lakers didn’t even let him get on the bus
"I mean Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and Shamet are pretty much better shooters than anyone left on the Warriors in 2019 after Klay got injured. Blake was also very good once he moved to Brooklyn.  Pretty much everyone outside of Draymond/Iggy were like out of rotations the very next year. Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook, Shaun Livingston, injured Boogie weren't rotation quality players. And the two guys who were in Dray/Iggy are poor shooters who defenders will happily not guard - even an injured Harden receives more defensive attention.  The 2019 Raptors were also a better team than the 2021 Bucks. Kawhi was at the height of his game and EVERY single player on the Raptors was a very good defender and a good shooter and most of them good playmakers too. FVV, Lowry, Siakam, Gasol all good passers for their position while being able to shoot and defend, and then Danny Green, Norman Powell, Ibaka all being more 3 and D (+ more for powell)."
Probably a similar outcome. Iguodala/Looney were more serviceable replacement options for KD than Quinn Cook would be for Steph. Steph did have a nice series against the Raptors too so I guess Raptors in 6/7 again.
Probably still lose in 6. Klay getting hurt and Quinn Cook starting and playing horribly really did us in.
"The 2016 warriors were far better than the 2019 warriors without KD. Iguodala, Livingston, Bogut, and Draymond were worse, they didn't have Barnes, and they had to give minutes to Quinn Cook. Also Klay got hurt."
"If it’s the Quinn Cook/victory cigar role, I’m down.   If we’re expecting him to actually play… then pass."
"The Lakers already have 4 guards how are going to get mins. If he gets signed he will be a end of the bench guy, similar to quinn cook when he was on the lakers last season."
Quinn Cook
Quinn Cook couldn’t make plays for shit
haven't watched him play but your description gives me quinn cook vibes.
I mean yeah it’s Quinn Cook
"&gt;I know regular season matchups hold no gravity in this sub  Those Lakers-Raptors games in particular I don't think should have much significance. The first matchup was in early November back when the Lakers were still using Troy Daniels and Quinn Cook as part of the regular rotation, and the second game came in the bubble after the Lakers had already secured the #1 seed and were just resting for the playoffs. I don't know how much you can really take away from those two games."
Quinn Cook couldn't do a thing against FVV and Lowry
"It's because he's on the Lakers, it's literally that simple. When Lonzo was on the Lakers, twitter would blow up after a bad game. There'd be 30k trending tweets an hour after a game. Same thing with Brandon Ingram, same thing with Danny Green, Julius Randle, same shit with Quinn Cook, Josh Hart too. literally any time a Laker did something bad they would get blown up on social media. Guys on other teams don't have 30k tweets about them every night if they put up a stinker unless they're a superstar. If you're an average roleplayer on the lakers you get as much attention as a star on a small market team."
"Nets role players were about 20x better than the warriors in 2019. We were giving 27 minutes to the likes of Quinn Cook ffs, and 22 to the corpse of Bogut"
"Bradley didn’t even play on the bubble.   Quinn cook and Dudley aren’t depth… they had more dnp than games played and were garbage time players. Calling them “the best 13 and 14th” players in the eagle is laughably dumb, they were towel wavers and moral support guys, not depth.    The lakers had zero wing depth, no back up point guards, and they didn’t get Morris until the buyout.    Oh also remember when you said “how do the lakers find spacing”…. LMAOOOOOOOOO"
I didn’t read all that tbh but I definitely disagree with you thinking the champion Lakers didn’t have depth. Rondo/Bradley/Caruso/Kuz/Kieff/Javale/Dwight hell even Quinn Cook and Dudley were probably the best 13th and 14th men that year. Please name 5 teams that year that had a deeper bench than that.
"ah, didn't know they were friends. that's how quinn cook got a contract with the warriors (kd's friend)  if paschall can stay healthy then the jazz got a solid 11th man with some upside potential, but the warriors definitely weren't fleeced. clearly looking to open a roster spot"
"They filled the Kevin Durant hole with Andrew Wiggins. There's certainly room left over, but it's not like the hole is wide open. And at the same time they've filled the Jordan Bell, Jonas Jerebko, Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook, and Jacob Evans slots with Wiseman, Porter, Bjelica, Toscano-Anderson, and Poole. The bench has been upgraded. The Iguodala and Livingston holes still need filling, though."
"Russ on the Rockets was the 2nd best player though, on the Lakers he'll be the 3rd best. The Lakers will be totally fine if Westbrook plays fewer minutes or skips games for load management or whatever. I envision their rotation most of the year with the Lakers staggering LeBron and Westbrook as much as possible.   And come playoff time, well honestly we don't know what the rest of the roster will look like by then. The Lakers are always players in the buyout market, and I expect they'll make mid-season trades as well. Two years ago when AD and LeBron first played together, if you watched their opening night game, Troy Daniels and Quinn Cook were part of the regular rotation and Caruso got a DNP-CD. What we see at the end could be very different than what we see in the first half of the year."
"can go smaller and use Prince George County, Maryland; population 900k  KD, Oladipo, Markelle Fultz, Michael Beasley, Ty Lawson, Jeff Green, Quinn Cook, Jerami Grant, Roy Hibbert, Thomas Robinson, Jarrett Jack.  They could probably give Slovenia a run"
"I'm pretty sure at one point when Curry had to sit in game 4, they played a lineup of Quinn Cook, Jordan Bell, McKinnie, Draymond, and one legged Boogie. Ugliest basketball ever"
"I wish the Lakers brought back Quinn Cook also, perfect chemistry guy who seems to be cool with literally everyone"
"Danny green is trash, javale is trash, quinn cook is trash, westbrook is better than kcp, wtf u want us to do?"
time to bring back quinn cook
"Plus we still need to see what happens with Schroder. I'd have to think some sign and trades are still being worked out for a few key guys around the league (DeRozan, Dinwiddie, Markkanen, etc), and Schroder is likely to be one of those guys.   The Lakers have a tendency to get all their minimum guys signed first before moving on to their bigger business. When they were building the championship team, literally the first announced free agent signings were Troy Daniels and Quinn Cook. The bigger moves will probably come tomorrow or the day after."
"&gt; best perimeter guard rotation  Defensive perimeter guard rotation. Though the year before that was arguably even better (Avery Bradley, with a bit of Quinn Cook) offering  different look.  Though Rondo was not great defensively, he made up for it in the bubble with his playmaking."
Hey you show some respect for garbage time goat Quinn Cook
The Quinn Cook special
They'll probably bring back Quinn Cook.
"But you have to agree that the Warriors were falling like bowling pins. Steph hand injury, KD Achilles, klay's acl tear. The rest of the squad was apart from Steph, Dray and Iggy were kinda scrubs, like Alfonzo McKinney, Jordan Bell, Jonas Jerebko or Quinn Cook. Out of those only Steph was a scoring threat. Not saying the Raptors didn't deserve it, but they were facing a diminished squad."
Quinn Cook and Javale are available as well
Javale McGee  Lance Stephenson  Rondo  Dwight Howard  Marc Gasol  Dennis Schroder  Avery Bradley  Danny Green  Jared Dudley  Montrezl Harrel  Quinn Cook  JR Smith  Dion Waiters  Tyson Chandler  Andre Drummond  Russell Westbrook  Potentially Carmelo and Iguodala  It's like a kid playing 2K
Iggy was replaced by Nick Young and Quinn Cook lol
"You haven't seen Troy Daniels, Quinn Cook, Wes Matthews, or Ben McLemore?   The idea that the Lakers FO hasn't signed shooters is a myth. They did. Vogel just didn't play them very much because (other than Matthews) he didn't trust them on defense. Getting guys who can shoot and defend at the level the Lakers expect is really hard and those guys make a ton of money."
With what fucking money? They’re getting Quinn Cook and I.T at this rate
"He was supposed to be our backup PG last season but only played 13 games due to his head injury. We played guys like Damyean Dotson, Quinn Cook, Yogi Ferrell, and Jeremiah Martin as backup PGs as a result. Rubio will be a godsend compared to those guys."
Caruso? That man is getting paid by the Cavs. Try 2020 NBA champion Quinn Cook
Quinn Cook is happy to fill that role at a much cheaper price and will also want an apology for forgetting him when the bus left
"This is the wackest argument ever lmao. The Raptors barely beat a Dubs team with 2/3 of its best players injured (not to mention the $50+ Million of cap space they accounted for. You think Steph would have been box-and-oned if we had other good rotation players?) Jordan Bell, Alphonso Mickinnie, Jonas Jerebko, Quinn cook should NEVER get finals minutes"
Quinn cook is not a vet like those other guys. He broke out with the warriors from their g league team. How is a guy on his first contract in the nba a vet like Mo Williams?
"I was just thinking about how this team had a weird lack of random vets riding the bench like most championship teams seem to.   Last year, the Lakers had a bunch with Jared Dudley, JR, Dion, and Quinn Cook. The Raptors before them had Jeremy Lin and Jodie Meeks. The 2017 and 2018 Warriors had random dudes like Nick Young, Matt Barnes, and Quinn Cook (again) along for the ride. The 2016 Cavs had guys like Channing Frye, Mo Williams, and Dahntay Jones.  The closest parallel with these Bucks was probably Jeff Teague, but he may have been too involved in the rotation to fit that archetype. The rest of guys just warming their bench were all random young dudes, not aging vets, so it would’ve been nice to have Ersan there just to fill that role."
"Most of the players outside of steph klay and kd we added weren’t good three point shooters  Off the top of my head players who were good shooters were omri cassipi (who stopped shooting with us), quinn cook (who barely played), nick young and ian clark, barnes too (unless it was the finals lol)  Most of the main contributors outside the three shooters weren’t good - obviously they were good players, just didn’t need as many role players shooting well when you have steph klay and kd, and that dipped the percentages"
"Steph came close with 47 in game 3 of the 2019 Finals with both KD and Klay out due to injuries, but that was a blowout win for the Raptors. By that point the Warriors had zero depth so Quinn Cook, the corpse of Bogut, and Alfonzo McKinnie played heavy minutes, and Shaun Livingston started the last game of his career before retiring."
Quinn Cook
Leaving a teammate behind  The Quinn Cook special
LeBron led teams typically always have good team chemistry. The 2020 squad was fun with guys like JaVale and Quinn Cook hyping em up
"Everyone's favorite 6' shooting guard and locker room presence, Quinn Cook!"
" Marquese Chriss, Quinn Cook, Patrick Patterson, Dennis Smith Jr.  Not a bad group to pick the 15th guy off the bench."
nothing but love for Quinn Cook
MJ+Giannis+Quinn Cook has the same accolades (less finals appearances though)
Chris Paul’s drive on Quinn cook in game 5 will haunt us forever
I remember Caruso saying on I think JJ Reddicks podcast that the most important thing for a guy fighting to get in the NBA is too try provide teams with something they actually need.  Like no team really wants Quinn cook taking 15 shots a game lol.
This guys the Quinn Cook of Big3
Would he be a servicable PG though?  We're picking from.  Quinn Cook Isaiah Thomas Arcediacano Avery Bradley Darren Collison Gary Payton II Chris Chiozza  Cook has a Championship or two... always shot well.  Knows the system extremely well.  I think this is actually the one they pull trigger on gut feeling.
"Once Quinn Cook gets the right supporting cast around him, it’s over"
"Maybe it's my rose tinted glasses but quinn cook came out and played like a budget Allen iverson for like a month while steph curry was injured, then just faded into obscurity again"
Thats like trading george hill for Quinn Cook
"Those aren’t correlations, they’re coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn’t show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn’t make it any less of a small sample so that’s a weird point to mention.   And idk why you’re acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we’re at it let’s look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they’ve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
"Same. Liked him since his duke days. That was a likable team. Tyus Jones, Quinn Cook, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen before his reputation, Semi Ojeleye, a Plumlee bro. They had a squad"
"Lakers were playing Jared Dudley and Quinn Cook in the second quarter, they really had no bench bro"
I cant remember exactly but I stg I saw quinn cook get subbed in the game in game 6 of the finals in 2019 w like 5 min to go lol
Quinn Cook.  Stepped in for Steph when they needed him and ended up going on to win another one in the bubble.
at least Quinn Cook has rings
"He got run over by the team bus, Quinn Cook got left by it."
"There’s a max contract rule, otherwise Lebron, Curry, Harden, AD etc would go for market value of 60+ mil a year, that’s the *reason* why a good core gets screwed compare a team full of superstars  So yes, DLo, Ingram, Randle, Kuzma, Hart, Lonzo, are way way more expensive than AD and Lebron, that’s exactly my point  The Celtics got walker because they lost their core of Morris, Terry, Kyrie, Horford etc   The Warriors aren’t even a counter point. They kept the big 3, and were not able to put any good players around them, and even made KD take a pay cut to play with them. Their rotation besides them was Jacob Evans, Quinn Cook, Jerebko, Mckinnie in the nba finals, none of them are in the league a year and a half later"
Quinn Cook is friends with so many top tier NBA players and I think has more IG followers than like 90% of the league?
He wasnt shut down but do you know what a box and one is? Its 4 on 1. Anyone would struggle. KD has never ever one time been guarded with a box and one because hes never been on a roster where is second best offensive player is Quinn Cook.
"Well first off last years team was a different team than the team that won the championship. Watching that championship team you could tell they had fun as a team playing ball. It translated to the bench as well whether  it was Dwight, McGee, Dudley or even Quinn Cook when he was on the roster they had fun on the bench. Last year did seem very meh. It’s no fun when your Star players are injured. The 7 foot tall cheerleaders in Dwight and McGee are gone. The team lost some of the fun and with a new season starting right back up not long after the bubble. I’m sure some of the dudes who were there for the finals probably were in a clock in clock out mentality the next season if not that they were certainly tired. I’m not sure how many games you actually watch of the Lakers but I feel like the fans who watch a lot of the games as well as the players weren’t at all down until AD got hurt then even more so when Lebron went down. Maybe Lebrons negative attitude towards starting the season so quickly had some effect on the team but I doubt the the players who also just played had different opinions. It’s speculation for sure but I’m sure they would’ve loved more time off but the season has to go on what can ya do about it.    TLDR The 2020 Championship was very fun to watch and it was obvious they had fun too. Last year players sometimes looked sluggish and I’d chalk it up to injuries and the quick turnaround"
"Oooh I like this one. I’ll add J Cole, Quinn cook, tobias harris"
You mean Chris Paul’s drive on Quinn cook in game 5
"And was heard of his rookie season as well. I’m saying Kuzma just didn’t pop out of thin air like Quinn Cook with the Warriors. Lebron didn’t give him a name, he already had one."
"&gt;	The list of active NBA players with at least 2 Championships is actually surprisingly short: ​  1. (1 player) Lebron James ​  1. (8 players) Stephen Curry, Danny Green, Draymond Green, Udonis Haslem, Andre Iguodala, Patrick McCaw, JaVale McGee, Klay Thompson ​  1. (5 players) Quinn Cook, Kevin Durant, Damian Jones, Kawhi Leonard, Rajon Rondo  Is this looking like this because of my Apollo app or did OP mess up the formatting here? Context and general knowledge tell me it’s 4 chips, 3 chips, 2 chips, but I’d be lying if it didn’t take me a minute to realize wtf I was supposed to be looking at.  Edit: lol, and the formatting gets messed up even worse when quoting it. 🤷🏾‍♂️"
Quinn Cook stares longingly at his phone
If my aunt had balls she’d be my uncle. Rockets lost 2 straight games with KD not playing. Warriors were giving rotation mins to Quinn Cook and Alfonzo Mckinnie and the Rockets still couldn’t win game 6 lol.
"I’m curious, didn’t Golden State with Steph + Klay + Dray with a worse spacing AND arguably worse depth take arguably the best defensive team in the past decade to 6 games in the Finals (and almost to 7)? Not to mention they made it there going 5-0 without Cousins and KD prior to the Raptors series?   That Golden State team played all of Jonas Jerebko, Alfonzo McKinnie, Andrew Bogut, Jordan Bell and Quinn Cook actual 4th quarter minutes of a Finals game. Is this Warriors team bad enough to do THAT? Or did I mention that Looney was the only other player other than the Splash Bros to even have a league average TS% that series out of everyone that averaged double digit minutes?  The current Warriors team as they stand have a better 6th man, a better starting small forward, AND more spacing than that 2019 Warriors team that made the Finals. The only thing that the non-KD 2019 Warriors have over this current Warriors is pre-injury Klay and experience. We even have a good enough package to trade for another star in case things don’t work out. Yet “worst situation in the league for a star”? Like that’d be worse than Zion or Luka’s? C’mon now."
"Could you explain why you think that? Because the eye and numbers test doesn't really support it. Gasol played by far the least minutes of any Raptors starter in large part because he struggled to keep up switching with smaller players. This is despite being surrounded with elite perimeter players to give him help like Leonard, Lowry, Siakam and Green (that team was stacked defensively). In a tight series that easily could have gone 7, Draymond anchored a defense with awful defenders like Cousins, Quinn Cook, and 35 year old Iggy playing big minutes. Draymond also played 75 more minutes than Gasol that series, while leading both teams in assists by a wide margin (I know we're discussing defense, but carrying a defense while leading a team on offense is insane).   &amp;#x200B;  To summarize, Draymond and Curry nearly forced the series to 7 dominating on offense and defense, while Gasol was a great role-player who protected the rim and stretched the floor, but was 5th on his team in total minutes. I don't see how this is a comparison at all."
"Cam Payne been average ever since he sprained his ankle against the Clippers in the WCF. He could easily be outta the league in a few years ala Mike James, Quinn Cook, Alonzo Trier, Isaiah Thomas, Dion Waiters style if his play falls off a bit and reverts back to his old ways."
I hope someone signs Quinn Cook
"We can offer THT, Bradley and Quinn Cook."
"&gt; +/- isnt really a good indication of an individual's player defensive matrics buddy.  Actually yes it is and it is extremely consistent and predictive season to season, much smarter people than you and I use it for analysis.   &gt; Please dont forget Warriors had Wiggins, Draymond, Looney as well. As much as I feel Oubre doesnt fit well with the team, he was a good defender.  You keep changing the argument, all I said was Bazemore would be perfectly fine for 20 minutes. Your argument supports my point that basketball defenses is 5 vs 5 and even 1 vs 1, Bazemore isn't some weak line of attack. If anything that's Westbrook and LeBron when they are in coasting mode and have lazy lapses on defense.   &gt; Warriors fans complain about Mulder because they expect too much from him because they literally have no good shooters  Warriors had plenty of good shooters. The problem was dealing with a starting lineup that had 2 awful - literally non-existent - shooters in Draymond Green and Looney. Even Oubre shot close to 50% on wide open 3s after his awful start. The problem isn't having good shooters, it's having good shooters that can also play serviceable defense. This is the reason Quinn Cook doesn't see play and easily the biggest limitation to Mulder."
J Cole looking Quinn Cook
NBA champion Quinn Cook
Quinn Cook for the 15th spot wouldn't be bad too
I said this before. I am closer to Keljin Blevins than Keljin Blevins is to Quinn Cook
"The Plumlees always seemed 8ft tall on the dance floor at Shooters.  Once saw Mason walking a tiny dog around our apartment complex and the size difference was hilarious.  Also once saw Marshall about 90 minutes before an afternoon tip-off eating a burrito in the Bryan Center.  It was his redshirt season, but he probably was supposed to be over at Cameron by then lol  Quinn Cook wasn’t huge but was the coolest guy, folks would come and dap him up or chat for a minute, and he just chilled in his booth at Shooters, holding court, giving time to everyone.  Brandon Ingram was impossibly tall + skinny."
"&gt;  a lot of the ""pure"" plus minus statistics favor Curry more than they should because of the Warriors' tendency to never play with with the bench  not only that, it's also due to Warriors never had a real guard on the bench, like one can shoot, run some basic pick &amp; roll, and some off-ball movement. the closest one they ever got was Quinn Cook who was basically a G leaguer. Livingston was basically a forward who can't shoot outside of 14ft, and Klay can't handle the ball, so it makes Curry very unique in Warrior's offense, and boosted his plus-minus or on-off numbers"
"You're a moron, learn how to clearly state what you mean rather than jumbling both of your thoughts into one sentence. Herro and KPJ are very close, but I see KPJ as the better player by a small margin right now. Give me a reason why Herro is better other than he's played playoff minutes or he's played more games. I mean Quinn Cook has played significantly more regular season and playoff time than both, but you wouldn't try to say he's better."
Except I think he will be even better than Quinn Cook
"Def not Iggy, but   Shaun Livingston, Leandro Barbossa, Ian Clark, Quinn Cook, Alfonso Mckinney (sort of, he did play better than he was before), Mareese Speights, Pat McCaw, Baze (tho you can't really 'fix' bad bbiq) Damion Lee, Jarret Jack, Carl Landry, Marqueese Chriss, etc. Juan Toscano Anderson's playing really fucking well, too.  And while they weren't really reclamation projects, we did get some great vet minutes from previous all-stars, like David Lee, Andrew Bogut, David West, Jermaine O'Neal, etc.   And we find great late first round/second round picks that end up great like Gil, Monta Ellis, Draymond. Here's to hoping Jordan Poole can replicate the magic."
"Other guys that played better on the warriors before and after: Ryan Clark, Quinn Cook, Jarret Jack (after), Andrew Bogut (after), Marresse Speights, bazemore and Carl Laundry.   Turns out playing with the great shooter ever makes it easier for others to succeed."
2018 Warriors had objectively a worse supporting cast than the 2017 version. They were relying on guys like Quinn Cook to hit shots and Livingston-West were on their very last legs.
"Steph, Dray, Klay for half the series, and then Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn cook, Javale McGee, senior citizens Andre Iguoudala and Shaun Livingston.  Certainly doesn’t look like a super team to me lmao. You’re calling people delusional when this is your take?"
"Huh? The warriors were running jordan bell, Quinn Cook, and Alfonso Mckinnie heavy minutes in the finals lol, no one outside of lebron would've been expected to be competitive in a finals series with that team lol  While I agree steph could've played better in the last game, to say that the last 3 was pretty open is straight stupid, he's running off a screen with a guy right on his back, 2 in front of him and a weird pass"
Grew up playing AAU in the dc area.   Nate Britt   Kris Jenkins   Quinn cook   Justin Anderson    Kendall Marshall
"&gt;Even if he stayed as a 40% guy its not worth playing him due to defense  Already forgot about Jose Calderon, DJ Augustin, Quinn Cook, Jameer Nelson, etc? There will always be a spot on a roster for guys who can shoot 40% from 3."
Healthy Klay is a toss up as is. But KD’s 30m salary slot going to a few more role players instead of Quinn cook and Alfonzo McKinnie is a guaranteed ring
"a healthy klay or just an actual solid bench they could afford to have because they don't have the money locked up in another max contract, why not?  after kd and klay went down they were playing steph and dray with quinn cook as well as the corpses of shaun livingston and andrew bogut."
"Multiple all stars?? Klay and KD were out, draymond wasn't all star in 2019 neither was DeMarcus cousins. He had no all stars with him consistently available to play in the finals that year. And plus that warriors team was a top heavy team, besides Klay, KD, draymond and Steph who else did they have? After their stars went down they had guys like Quinn cook, an aging Shaun Livingston, jerebko, McKinney. That's not a championship team. Curry had no help and made the most of it."
"Raptors do this shit against every team lol  It's so annoying how they think it's some genius tactic, it only worked because they did it first against Jonas Jebreko and Quinn Cook"
lmao is that Quinn Cook next to him
"Penny hardaway, Kobe, Wade,TP, Manu, Clyde drexler, Kenny Smith, Sam Cassell, Marbury, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Westbrook, Curry, Kyrie, Harden. Those are some of the ball dominant guards those players you listed played with.   AD has played with Jrue Holiday, Rondo past his prime, Jimmer Fredette, Austin Rivers, Tim Frazier, Quinn Cook, Eric Gordon before he left the Pelicans. You also just compared him to the greatest centers of all time, so that's a pretty high bar. Also putting KD in that list pretty much destroys your entire argument, might as well throw in Kwahi, Bron and TMac if you're just throwing in wings as well."
"They had Quinn Cook play significant minutes in the NBA finals.  The next year, he was last on the bench for the Lakers during their Mickey Mouse run."
I was literally replying to your post talking about how the defense was much better in 19. No shit. You think I didn't consider that? The best non-Steph scorers on the floor were Quinn Cook and a one-legged Boogie. That's why it worked. Check and see how many of those guys I listed are out of the league or close to it.
"Not quite the same when the other guys on the floor aren't Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, Boogie on one leg, Looney, Jonas Jerebko, Jordan Bell, Iguodala, and the shell of Shaun Livingston."
Even with the way better team the Warriors got a lot of open shots off that game but just didn't have any decent shooters. Only one who could claim to shoot on that roster with KD and Klay out was Quinn Cook but he was a traffic cone on defense.
"It was a smart strategy in the 2019 finals when Stephs teammates were Quinn Cook, Alphonso Mckinnie and Kevon Looney.  Against this current squad its a stupid strategy.  Warriors have role players that can shoot and make plays now unlike 2019."
"Giving open shots to Wiggins, Poole, Porter is still a bad game plan. It’s not Alfonzo Mckinnie, Quinn Cook and Boogie on one leg out there with Steph like 2019."
&gt; Quinn Cook  nope in russia
Quinn cook with the -16 in 12 minutes of **GAME 6 of the NBA FINALS**
"It's not as easy to box-and-1 Steph when he doesn't have Alfonzo Mckinnie, Quinn Cook, Jonas Jerebko, Jordan Bell and Boogie out there"
"Imagine if this was still Quinn Cook. Or better yet, ky bowman"
"Durant could have a role player Introduce him, like Quinn Cook"
"Am I crazy or do the Lakers seem to target everyone that leaves the Warriors?   McGee, Quinn Cook, Bazemore, Alphonso McKinnie, Damian Jones, tried to get Iguodala"
The only players shorter and worse defense than him during our dynasty years was Ian Clark and Quinn Cook. Players who usually play when he isn't in the game. So he has effectively been the shortest player on his lineups from 2014-2019. Yea no shit coaches are gonna target him. The only truly worse defenders than Curry on the bench over the years was like Lee and Speights. I even thought Barbosa was a very capable defender.
"Then you have anti-Curry glasses on lmao   Kawhi spent the whole finals babysitting a corner shooter and letting the rest of the team do the heavy lifting. Curry was out running against a box and one because there were two other players on the Warriors who could shoot 3’s and one was Quinn Cook   Buddy. I’m a Raptors fan, if Kawhi outplayed Curry I would tell you lmao"
"Dame and CJ are not thinking when they said they would like to play with Draymond because neither have good off ball movement. If they are willing to move off ball for Draymond, then they should at least be able to show it.  The real problem with Blazers is that they suck defensively because  1. Their back court is undersized and bad at defense 2. Their front court is meh defensively. This issue was exposed in 2019 WCF against the Warriors. This was the Blazers best chance to win, KD was injured and at this point Warriors starting center was Jordan Bell and the bench consisted of Alfonso Mckinney, Jonas Jerebko, Quinn Cook each averaging over 12+ minutes. Blazers back court are not built for playoffs. When was the last time double guard centered lineups won a ring. 2015 Warriors because Klay plays real defense. If Klay's defense was on the level of Curry, then they wouldn't have gotten very far either."
Freaking Quinn Cook
"Dame got swept in 2019 WCF by Warriors without Durant, with fken Jordan Bell as there starting Center. They had Alfonso Mckinney, Jonas Jerebko, and Quinn Cook off the bench averaging 12+ minutes per game. Dame is the biggest playoff joke I have watched. At least Harden came close to beating the Warriors. Dame got fken wrecked every time."
"Yea itll be interesting.  When the raptors went box-1 and klay went down, we literally had 0 shooters.  Quinn Cook was the only ""shooter"" we had left.  Neither Iggy nor Draymond needed to be defended at the perimeter. Box-1 now, and you still have to deal with 70% Klay, Wiggins, and JP who can all score from anywhere."
"Nurse didn’t bust out the Box and 1 until it was only Curry on the floor playing with Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green  That type of defense is for high school basketball to shut down one specific player on the other team. There is an opening for everyone else if they’re capable enough"
"Holy smokes you are special.  First off if you don't understand why FG% is useless while comparing efficiency and why TS% is a better metric then you already exposed yourself.  Klay was out in game 3 and curry scored 47. Are you sure YOU watched the series? Accusing me of not knowing the details, fucking hilarious.  My bandwagon flair is a fucking joke, while pointing that out you again fucked up. I dont even live in the Americas, i had to wake up at 4am in the morning to watch those matches. Fun times.  30.5 points at .598 TS and 35 at .477. It's not that hard to see which one was better.  If you think quinn cook, bogut, Livingston, mckinnie, jordan bell, jerebko where anything but a g league squad  and were much better than the cavs in 2015 then idk what to tell you."
"Bruh curry had .6 TS in 2019 and lebron had .477 so bitch please don't compare the FG%. It wasn't just KD who was out klay was out too. Outside of dray and Steph that was a g league team. Most of them are out of the league rn quinn cook, jerebko, mckinnie, bogut, Livingston."
"I mean the average person shouldn't fuck with any NBA player including the ones that are the sons of NBA players and grew up with money. They're super human athletes and could fuck up a massive majority of the population.   I'm from the DMV. I'm not fucking with a soul from there whether it's KD, Michael Beasley, Quinn Cook, Dipo, Fultz, Jerami Grant, Jeff Green, etc. Just cause they not from a country that's got it tougher don't mean they ain't with the shit"
"Hmm, nbot sure why it might have returned that. I think first think I'd check is if you're able to run any player (try with a rookie, they have less games and it'll go quicker). If that returns actual output then I'm not sure what to think.  But I ran Klay's data to check/ for you and got this:  | Rank   | Player    | Assists| |:-----------|------------:|:------------:| | 1 | Stephen Curry | 187 | 2 | David Lee | 169 | 3 | Draymond Green | 162 | 4 | Harrison Barnes | 97 | 5 | Kevin Durant | 81 | 6 | Andrew Bogut | 75 | 7 | Andre Iguodala | 72 | 8 | Marreese Speights | 56 | 9 | Zaza Pachulia | 50 | 10 | David West | 42 | 11 | Shaun Livingston | 40 | 12 | Carl Landry | 38 | 13 | Brandon Rush | 35 | 14 | Festus Ezeli | 30 | 15 | Kevon Looney | 27 | 16 | JaVale McGee | 25 | 17 | DeMarcus Cousins | 20 | 18 | Jeremy Tyler | 14 | 19 | Omri Casspi | 13 | 20 | Nate Robinson | 13 | 21 | Quinn Cook | 12 | 22 | Dorell Wright | 11 | 23 | Jonas Jerebko | 11 | 24 | Jordan Bell | 10 | 25 | Charles Jenkins | 10 | 26 | Jermaine O'Neal | 9 | 27 | Patrick McCaw | 8 | 28 | Dominic McGuire | 8 | 29 | Alfonzo McKinnie | 7 | 30 | Damian Jones | 7 | 31 | Richard Jefferson | 6 | 32 | James Michael McAdoo | 6 | 33 | Jarrett Jack | 6 | 34 | Leandro Barbosa | 6 | 35 | Jordan Crawford | 6 | 36 | Monta Ellis | 5 | 37 | Chris Wright | 4 | 38 | Nick Young | 4 | 39 | Ekpe Udoh | 4 | 40 | Damion Lee | 4 | 41 | Ian Clark | 3 | 42 | Matt Barnes | 3 | 43 | Mickell Gladness | 3 | 44 | Andris Biedriņš | 2 | 45 | Anderson Varejão | 2 | 46 | Justin Holiday | 2 | 47 | Steve Blake | 2 | 48 | Jason Thompson | 2 | 49 | Ish Smith | 2 | 50 | Mikki Moore | 1 | 51 | Hilton Armstrong | 1 | 52 | Kwame Brown | 1"
There’s no way he only had 2 to quinn cook?
"Danny Green, roco, Jlin, Gerald Green, Shaun Livingston, Jj barea, Quinn Cook, yogi ferrell. Lots of serviceable young guys coming out of the g league."
Quinn Cook?
Quinn Cook doesn't get calls
"Quinn Cook is awesome, if he were a couple inches taller or more of an athlete he'd still be in the league today, he was a skilled player and really well liked by his fellow players."
I remember last year we lost in 2ot to the Pistons then waived Quinn Cook. He wasn’t even in the game.
