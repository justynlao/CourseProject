Bruh give me Lamelo Ball or Anthony Edwards over wiseman any day. The center position is a really difficult place to thrive for young players because you need a Man’s body to bump around and score and rebound. Wiseman thin. We need thicc bodied centers.
"Anthony Edwards is two months older than Cade Cunningham. He'll be fine. Watch the games, man. Dude makes special plays routinely, he's just playing on a shit team in shit lineups right now."
"&lt;Anthony, Edwards,    my brain is broken"
"Quickley, Wiseman, Lamelo, Haliburton, Cole Anthony, Edwards, Patrick Williams, JaeSean Tate, and I guess Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman?"
"Do you see my flair? He's my favorite rookie by a mile and what he's given the Knicks in those 20 games is enough for me to take him first overall every time right now.   Also, that's debatable. He's 2nd in PPG for all rookies with 7 less minutes per game than #1 (Anthony Edwards). He's 5th in APG with, again, less minutes played than everybody in front of him."
1. Anthony Edwards  2. James Wiseman  3. Lamelo Ball  4. Patrick Williams  5. Isaac Okoro  We're 20 games into these guys' career and none of them have looked like they don't belong. Wait at least a year before you try to bring up this discussion.
"1. Quickley  2. Ball  3. Haliburton  4. Wiseman  5. Edwards  Honorable Mentions: Pritchard, Anthony"
Anthony Edwards [last 5 games:](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/edwaran01/gamelog/2021#15-19-sum:pgl_basic)    19.4/3.4/2.2 .469 from 3 with 1.4 steals a game  With no preseason he had a slow start and has been cooking since.
"Here’s the difference: Anthony Edwards got drafted roughly a month before he made his NBA debut and did not get a summer league to get used to his coaches or playing against professionals. Also, it’s clear you don’t watch the Wolves (and I don’t blame you) but don’t speak on what you don’t know. Edwards is getting better every game."
"I'm sorry, but Quickly does not lead anyone in any stat category aside from FT percentage.  What stats are you talking about here?      Because Wiseman leads in percentage from the field   Lamelo in steals and assists (2nd in Rebounds)   Wiseman in Rebounds   Anthony Edwards in points   Deni in 3pt %"
Anthony Edwards and Malik Beasley are going to be so good in the upcoming years. I never watch Timberwolves basketball and was thoroughly impressed how they played in both games
"He is neither small nor unathletic. He could shoot in college, and he led a poor team while being efficient himself which a lot of prospects can’t do. See: Anthony Edwards"
"&gt; That shit was nasty  [he sent him, like five 5 Anthony Edwards' away!](https://i.imgur.com/9bQK9C6.jpg)"
Anthony Edwards gonna run away with this one lol. That poll will age like milk
Bruh the disrespect to Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards with the A1 double take
"This one got me, the similar names trick me into putting them in the same bucket. When I heard there was a #1 pick named Anthony Edwards I was like *are you guys crazy?!*"
Pretty sure it's Anthony Edwards
"LaMelo Ball is averaging 6.1 assists and 2.5 turnovers per game while Anthony Edwards is averaging 1.8 assists and 1.8 turnovers per game in similar minutes. LaMelo Ball isn't just ""being flashy"", he's a playmaker that has shown really good ability to run an offense in limited minutes. Anthony Edwards isn't playing more fundamental basketball just because he's a scorer first (who by the way is barely averaging more points while being less efficient from the field).  In limited minutes LaMelo Ball shows a positive impact in every single advanced stat that exists while being a point guard learning how to run an offense which is rare for a rookie. Anthony Edwards is currently (only a rookie I understand) negatively impacting the game according to any stat available to public."
"It’s Anthony Edwards not Kelly Olynyk. Edwards is far too fast in the open court to be chased down by pretty much anyone except LeBron. Also Giannis. I’m not saying he’s as good, the dude is just a train of elite athleticism and strength."
The only thing similar so far about Anthony Bennett and Anthony edwards is their first name.  Edwards has been been playing well the last 5 games and if he keeps it up I can see him taking #1. Right now I thing it’s Halliburton/lamelo/IQ/Wiseman/Ant
"0% chance Edwards wins ROTY. He has been terrible in almost every game he's played thus far. He would basically need to turn into Ja Morant like now til the end of the season to really make folks forget how forgettable he was before now, and I don't see that happening realistically. My brutally honest assessment of Anthony Edwards? He's the next Anthony Bennet. That's really what I believe, and time will ultimately be the decider on if I'm right or not.  To me, ROTY is still a 2-man race: LaMelo and then Wiseman."
chill dude anthony edwards is not that bad. he has some growing pains its a part of the process. sexton might to all-star status. who says ty lue will win- he still would have to face the lakers in the conference finals and hopefully if they win-they would have to face the nets—considering they make it there without any injuries that could potentially derail them. and luka is not fat-he just lil thick.
Edward’s game is too filthy!!! In a 1 vs 1 Anthony Edwards would dog lamelo and I would love to see that battle!   From a ROY perspective lamelo has had more highlights which will get him the award since nba and media are voting and they will vote for whoever is better story to write about
"What 5? Wiseman, Haliburton, Quickley, Edwards, Anthony?"
The Bucks aren't any worse if you replace Giannis with Siakam. Lamelo Ball has peaked. Kemba is finished because of his knee. Timberwolves passed on generational talent in James Wiseman for a 6th man (Anthony Edwards). Sexton wins the MVP in this next 5 years. Luka is faaaaaaat. Ty Lue wins his second title.
"If we get this version of Anthony Edwards alongside DLo, Beasley, and KAT for the rest of the season, I don't know that we can make a playoff push considering how far in the hole we already are, but we can at least make it interesting."
I know we’ve been terrible without KAT but I think we’re starting to gel and get it together somewhat. Anthony Edwards may have just had his coming out party last night. Look for this kid to start getting more and more legit as the season goes on

"Thank you for stating that down voted! Anthony Edwards isn't here because I didn't find it that surprising. He was the first choice for a reason, because he's good."
Down voted. Larry Nance is on here but not Anthony Edwards?
I watched from about halfway through the third and other than Anthony Edwards that was probably the worst basketball I have watched this season
Anthony Edwards looking like DWade out here 👀👀
Anthony Edwards.
Anthony Edwards looks like Frank Gore. I finally placed it after it being on the tip of my tongue for awhile
Somebody said Anthony Edwards could be Dion Waiters or Dwyane Wade and that feels dead on
Yeah man in hindsight I would've drafted Bam as a DE instead of LB and then try to get Anthony Edwards as a LB. Pj Tucker is the worst member of team 2's defense IMO
"I think this draft will be seen as one of the GOATs 5-10 years from now . I’ve been saying forever that Lamelo should’ve been seen as the generational talent and gotten the same hype as Zion or Luka. Anthony Edwards and James Wiseman are a teir or two below him, but they still have superstar potential. Up and down the draft are people who will have significant careers in the league"
"The top 3 guys look like they could be all stars. Anthony Edwards has been unsurprisingly inefficient from long distance but he's a great finisher that has the tools to also be a good defender. James Wiseman is already one of the most fluid 7 footers I've seen. Lamelo is a great passer already and seems to be gaining confidence as a scorer.  Tyrese Haliburton is great, too. The guy has so much poise for a rookie.  Okoro looks like a good defensive player already. Not the type of guy who gives you flashy defensive highlights but the guy who can contain scorers for long stretches.  PWill was definitely a project coming into the draft but he looks already like an NBA starter Sometimes he goes a little mental, though, and shoots ill advised contested middies. Quickley and Maxey deserve a shout out too because of surpassing expectations."
"I would still pick lamelo third.  For some reason Anthony Edwards fits the mold of a shooting guard in hulk's body. I love his athleticism also, and finishes very strong in the rim. He would be the karl malone but at the sg position.  If he fixes his shooting, he would be a phenomenal player.  Lamelo is great, but I would take Edwards before him.  I also like wiseman cos he's a skilled 7 footer.  All three picks have a low floor."
"I think people underestimated how athletic he is. He's extremely fast off the foot, and at full acceleration. And he seems to have great stamina. Just because he can't jump as high as Anthony edwards doesn't mean he's not as athletically gifted and far more skilled."
"It depends on the pick. Cunningham and Mobley seem like special talents and Suggs and Green both have superset potential. And Kuminga would likely have gone over Anthony Edwards this year. I think if they get lucky in the lottery and land Cunningham or Mobley it would absolute make the trade worth it, especially if their own pick also lands high, that’s a full rebuild right there"
"Anthony ""A1"" Edwards   Zion ""The Big Easy"" Williamson   Deandre ""The Anomaly"" Ayton   Kyrie ""World B. Flat"" Irving"

Anthony Edwards
"People were low on this draft, but I feel like right now it looks pretty nice - Haliburton and Quickley look great, while Wiseman, Lamelo and Anthony Edwards show flashes of potential"
You guys just got the 1st pick in Anthony Edwards lol  Let's hope this year's pick is top 3.
i just think that Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards is a star y’all will be fine
"Wiggins is supposed to have all world talent, but was not producing at expectation. Heard he is doing better these days though.  Also I understand Anthony Edwards' head is not completely in the game, and he was this year's top pick. Remains to be seen."
"PHI receives: Beal  MIN receives: Simmons  WAS receives: Anthony Edwards, Danny Green, PHL 2023, 2027 FRP, MIN 2021, 2023 FR swaps"
"No. This doesn’t make sense for the Wizards.   Bc Beal’s value isn’t going anywhere between now and the end of the season when the *exact* Minny pick is known.   If it’s Wiseman and the #1 pick, ok I’ll take it.   If it’s Wiseman and the #8 pick, hell no.   Or how about if GS’s own pick AND Minny’s pick are both top 5. In that case they may not even want wiseman and would prefer the 2 picks, or ask for all 3  Unless Beal makes it ugly, which I don’t think he will, Washington has the leverage.  Also, some draft picks are like cars, the second they get on the floor their value, or perceived value, plummets. So even tho wiseman was the #2 pick, and has shown some signs, most teams would probably have the 2021 #2 pick over him. 20 years ago sure teams would Iove him but now , in a guard driven game, centers just aren’t as valuable. Unless you come out and show obvious signs like say Lamelo, your value drops. Look at Anthony Edwards. His value isn’t close to #1 pick anymore"
"Moving Wiseman to the bench was the right move. He's playing with a lot more confidence and can actually score against second string players.   Oubre is looking better, he's reverting to the mean, as most of us expected him to eventually. Hopefully we can avoid any more wild downward swings from the mean (a few upward would be nice though lol)  Curry is the heart and soul of this team, but the double and triple teams are getting to him. He's still Steph, but he's not making as much magic as he usually would, there's just not enough space. Klay will be such a boon next season, even if he's only back 80%. This team is a contender with Klay. Next season will be fun.  Wiggins is a badass this year. He should be All-Defense. He's turned into such a reliable complimentary piece, just like Klay.   Dray is doing Dray things. If only he could shoot the 3 ball at even a 33% clip. Oh well. Still a valuable player.   I love Mulder. Maybe because his name reminds me of the X-Files. But he just doesn't seem to do anything wrong. He shoots lights out and fits the offense well.  I'm excited to see Mannion grow, I think it was smart to buy low on him. He's going to be alright. I could see him being our backup PG in a year or two.   Damion Lee is so intriguing. A little more consistency and he'd be a surefire starter. I like his game.    Anthony Edwards shows lots of flashes but I'm not convinced yet. His defense sucks. I'll give him a pass on offense since they didn't have their two best players and their coach is a moron. But he needs to develop better defense, a better handle, better shot selection, and better passing to be a positive asset.  I like a lot of Minny's players, they just don't seem to play winning basketball. They need some serious help."
Reddit heard Bill Simmons is shorting Anthony Edwards stock and decided to artificially inflate his value.
Carsen Edwards or anthony edwards?
"Lamelo, Anthony Edwards, ja morant, Zion Williamson, SGA, Collin Sexton, the Celtics superstars (Brown and Tatum are both near superstars), Embiid , Ben Simmons , De’Aron Fox , there’s so much talent in the league rn you can go on and on ."
"Some of these deals are really bad for WAS. The price for Beal should be similar to Harden’s. He’s not as good but he’s four years younger.   PHL receives: Beal  MIN receives: Ben Simmons  WAS receives: Anthony Edwards, Danny Green, MIN 2021 FRP, PHL 2023+2027 FRP, PHL first rd swaps in 2024+2026."
I actually think Draymond was also appreciating Anthony Edwards' play here as well. The game was fully in hand and they were actually having quite a bit of fun. They were laughing and enjoying it.
Hard to not love Anthony Edwards.
"heard anthony edwards shouting ""hell yea"" and took it personally"
Alright Anthony Edwards I guess I'll keep watching.
Anthony Edwards shot that with confidence
"Oh I see, I didn't even see that the guy I responded to said Curry on Edwards.  Because it was so similar to what Edwards said about Curry after out last game I read it as Anthony Edwards on Steph Curry at halftime."
"""I've been wathcing him on TV for a mintue. It ain't fake."" -Steph Curry on Anthony Edwards at halftime."
Anthony Edwards skill and craft really belies his basketball experience
"Anthony Edwards is very, very good at basketball."
I bet I could beat Anthony Edwards in a race if he didn't know we were racing and he was just walking down the street looking at his phone
"I know it’s very very early, but I do not like Anthony Edwards playstyle. Too mas midrange"
"Okay, then the news is shit. Anthony Edwards is *horrible.*"
"Uh...what? Anthony Edwards has been like...the worst player in the league. Like, worse than Theo Maledon, and he looks *so* far away from being ready.   Vassell, Ball, and Haliburton have been 1-2-3 in some order."
These are bad. How has Anthony Edwards been better than Devin Vassell?       [Just look at this shit.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Esl0rlsVkAkcaPJ?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096)
"I mean the Wolves would certainly be interested in an all star PF who can defend lol. Anthony Edwards,Culver,Rubio and picks is a really good offer also.  But again there is a close to 0% chance they actually trade Pascal."
"I’m not an idiot, lol. Unlike most nba fans I regularly watch college basketball. I know what an elite college athlete facing grown men looks like. You’re seeing it right now with Anthony Edwards. That’s not what’s happened to Zion. Even in the open court he’s a completely different athlete now. I don’t know why there’s so much resistance to this. He’s still good, just not what many who saw him in college were expecting, largely because of his odd athletic decline.  His path forward, sans regaining his explosiveness, is developing more of a jumper and increasing his playmaking ability in transition. He really flashed a bit of that in college."
"How does that franchise, I’m sorry for my language, fuck up both Culver and Anthony Edwards? They’re like a third world country prison when you go into that organization. It’s like “ok everyone for themselves and there’s this guy that’s in charge but not really just stay here until you do your time and then go choose where you want to go.”"
"Im being downvoted because Wolves bad lol.  People dont watch us and i dont blame them, but then rather than say they dont watch us they decide that because Rubio was good in Utah and Phoenix it has to be 100% our fault for him being shit this year.  Obviously its partly us. Saunders is a bad coach and our bench unit is devoid of scorers outside of a rookie Anthony Edwards. But that doesnt then mean his scoring and defence have to fall off"
"Hopefully he wont become Anthony ""Bennet"" Edwards, because he is not playing well right now."
We need to be patient with Anthony Edwards. 19 year olds usually don't succeed in the NBA. RJ Barrett was godawful last year at 19 and this year he's great.
"Get Anthony Edwards to the Spurs or Warriors. Minnesota has probably the worst developing I’ve seen.   They just enforce bad habits, have a terrible system, and have a losing culture."
"I might get hate on this one but I think they should **trade KAT.**  If their  pick this year is fourth in this draft I think Minnesota should take a hard look at themselves and see what their direction is.  If the Warriors would be willing to trade that pick and another future first, Oubre, Chriss, &amp; Wiseman + whatever else just for KAT. I'd take a long look in the mirror &amp; do it if I was Rosas   realistically their window would Kael Anthony Towns is gone now I don't understand how they could get better in the west nonetheless with him at the fore front of the team.  Having Edwards, Wiseman &amp; that top pick in thai loaded draft would set them up for the future rebuilding. I think it's a logically cruel move but a move that would give them more breathing room."
"To be honest I feel like noone can mature right now, the team is completetely young dudes trying to neck eachother. The worst part is the vet wants out. Edwards is the best player to put hope on, but I understand its fucking frustrating. With Wiggins gone its the next top dysfunctional pick.   I wish you guys could find a way to make the guys like eachother and develop, but it seems like people are distant. I love Anthony Edwards. I feel like he wants out from day one."
"Man I want to help but I think its just an outmatch. Deangelo is so immature still. I think Edwards is the real diamond but he is so raw. Beasley got about what you can expect. I don't know. Invest. Start Culver.   Call me crazy but I do think Anthony Edwards might take 1-2 years but he will be a beast. He has all the tools and he just seems so raw. I can see him being amazing. A-1 from day 1 baby. I am from Atlanta and love him, he will just take a season or 2. I'd take him on my team no questions asked."
"Not saying Hawks haven’t been bad but the Timberwolves have been bad since KG left (unless you consider being destroyed in the first round once in the past decade good), and we just gave up our first pick essentially. We can’t develop players at all just look at Anthony Edwards recent stats, we have the worst coach in the league, we’re paying a max to a player who’s only won us one game this season, and our star player will probably leave in the next 3 seasons. Not to mention the franchise might not even be in our state for the next decade."
Haven't seen timberwolves play against my team yet or other teams. But how is Anthony Edwards doing? I don't even see his highlights on this sub. Mostly Ball and Wiseman only.
"You mean Anthony ""Bennett"" Edwards"
It's too early to call Anthony Edwards a bust  But I'm calling him a bust.
Anthony ‘Bennett’ Edwards
Anthony Edwards is a hawks sleeper agent
Is this more of capela being good or minny being absolute shit.  Btw Anthony Edwards 18 minutes 0-9 lmaoooo.
He’s blocked Anthony Edwards 3 times. Putting on a master class.
Anthony Edwards is getting NOTHING from the refs. If I was the Timberwolves I'd be *pissed*
Damn Anthony Edwards is having a rough time transitioning to the NBA lmao
"A 3 way deal with someone like the Timberwolves would be the best outcome for all sides Imo. Wolves can team KAT with Simmons who'll add some much needed defence to that team and will fit them really well. Wizards can get Anthony Edwards, salary filler and picks. Sixers get Beal"
We did that to Edwards. Tbh its the same situation as in Minny as it its in GSW.   He's going in knowing that he's not the franchise but that he's there to help the stars (Curry/Klay in GSW's case and D'lo/KAT in our) and Anthony handled it well enough.
"Although still early, I don’t think Anthony edwards would be the best player in his draft as well."

"i don't understand why you guys are bad  you have quality players. I know Towns is out right but  Towns, Russell, Rubio, Beasley, Anthony Edwards who seems decent as a rookie. Dont you have some solid bench players too like Okogie?"
I feel like we missed out huge on Anthony Edwards in Golden State because he and Curry both have that really kind shitposter energy and having them in the same locker room would’ve been hilarious
"Don't worry man, they just drafted Anthony Edwards, a man who is slated to become the next *checks notes* Andrew Wiggins."

I think Towns gets traded. Minny has something with Anthony Edwards and they never build around 2 stars. I think they trade Towns and start building around Ant-man.
The Anthony Edwards dunk was one of the few rare actual posters imo
I wish Anthony Edwards would've done the dunk contest :-/
This contest needed Anthony Edwards
how come anthony edwards wasn’t here
Miles Bridges or Anthony Edwards could've won this in their sleep
if you think I knew who markelle fultz or anthony edwards were before the draft you're wrong my guy
"Timberwolves are going to waste KAT, Anthony edwards and possibly even Cade Cunningham a sad sight"
"I wonder who has the right opinion, someone who judges wings by the first half of the season or someone who gives them time to develop into the player they will be. Anthony Edwards was definitely not the right pick for MN. But wings take a long time to develop, the majority of the good wings you see today started off with bad efficiency and as raw prospects. Come back to me in 3 years and we will see if he was a bust or not.  And none of those aforementioned players have ever had to go straight into a season with no training camp, no shootarounds, and 2 coaches in 30 days. Im sorry but your take not only exposes your level of NBA knowledge, but it also exposes that you haven't watched basketball for more than 2 years. Ive seen Tyreke Evans go from star to bust, and seen kawhi turn from a defensive-oriented wing to an all-around stud. I know better than to give up on Anthony Edwards. Please take your negativity to a different source.  Also on a tangent, Deandre Ayton got similar treatment when luka and trae broke out, I think you and I both know Ayton still has monster potential.   TL: DR Stop being a doomer"
Some of y’all trying real hard to take away from Anthony Edwards dunk
"id rather have a guy with the awareness to either step up sooner or know that he doesnt have the angle to block anthony edwards. maybe its not a fair criticism to just say be better, but that simply wasnt a good basketball play"
Lol my man you can quite literally go order the [poster](https://www.redbubble.com/i/poster/Anthony-Edwards-Dunk-by-Jwhelan1/71749927.LVTDI?country_code=US&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAp4KCBhB6EiwAxRxbpLg4FDfO-bpjBSinFQqpp-_wLdjjzNVJQQzpqIqt0LAmNbT9Igi93BoCLjAQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) right now in any size and style that best fits your living space. I recommend springing for the semi-gloss finish on 110lb weight paper for a nice look that will last.  Some butthurt Raptors fans in here acting like they had Edwards nuts in their own faces personally lmao
Morris doesn’t have the size advantage on Giannis that Yuta has on Anthony Edwards.
Was this the Anthony Edwards dunk
"thats a sick photo, but ant has a full arms length over him, not exactly inches. on a lot of attempts against people not named anthony edwards sure, but next time he has to either get there sooner or get out of the way. contesting here gave the worst outcome"
"I don’t have a link but just search “Anthony Edwards dunk” on youtube and it should be right there. It was the dunk of the year, for sure."
"[he was inches away from getting the block, and it was a crazy high dunk. On a lot of attempts it would have been a block](https://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/anthony-edwards-poster-dunk-scaled-e1613794569170.jpg)"
"for sure, but you also need to know who is and who isnt that nasty lol. if you’re playing someone like anthony edwards, you have to either commit sooner (if you rewatch yuta hesitates to leave his man to contest) or get out the way and not give them a free throw"
"lol the point is that you shouldnt go for every single contest at the rim. for example, if ur ron baker on AD, or if ur a late arriving yuta watanabe on anthony edwards. its not always about who can get more vertical in a vacuum, if a dude like edwards is already in the air, contesting is just going to give him a free throw and a poster"
He dunks over Anthony edwards for the storyline and wins
"TWolves got KAT at #1 and Wiggins at #1 (via trade) in back-to-back years, then Kris Dunn at #5 the following year, Anthony Edwards at #1 5 years after KAT."
"That's a funny way of saying Ricky Rubio, Anthony Edwards, Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, Ed Davis, Jaylen Nowell, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jaden McDaniels, Jake Layman, Jordan McLaughlin, and Jaun Hernangomez are 1-11. It's a team game, feel free to name all the players contributing to our loses next time!"
"A lot of other folks need to apologize. I really wanted the Wolves to swindle a trade and draft Lamelo and get some like Bridges with the #1 pick. I'll be honest I was sad when Silver sad Anthony Edwards. Still early , but I cant keep lying to myself saying Edwards is better than Ball"
"That is Ricky Rubio (career 32% three point shooter), Jake Layman (career 31% three point shooter), Naz Reid (33%)  and Jarred Vanderbilt (25%) standing around the perimeter while rookie Anthony Edwards (who has less than 10 career post up possessions) tries to post up.  What's wrong with that?"
I mean... he a rookie... the same thing happens to Anthony Edwards and James Wiseman
I’m a better shooter than Anthony Edwards right now
"And not to rub salt in wounds, this could end up very differently......Anthony Edwards does stupid shit and takes awful shots. He's more athlete than scorer so far."
I can think of 5 people I want ahead of Anthony Edwards
People wanted Anthony Edwards but instead are getting Anfernee Simons (both nicknamed Ant)
Please don’t forget Anthony Edwards.(baby D-Wade)
"True! And look at how bad the picks were. Tyrese Haliburton, who would have gone No. 1 if he had played another collegiate year, was only picked at No. 12 by the Sacramento Kings. And yet he is the only real threat to LaMelo's RoY run.   What happened to Anthony Edwards? The greatest offensive rookie, except he lacks one factor: teamwork. Any teamwork at all. A star forward should average more than two assists in thirty minutes. Especially when working with other offensive players that also lack cohesiveness."
Could have easily chosen him over Anthony Edwards.  1st pick privilege
"Damn Cole Anthony was supposed to be up next.  I think he was #1 high school recruit for a while before the final rankings.    Ended up 4th in the class behind Wiseman, Edwards and Isaiah Stewart.  He'll probably be decent.  He was just unfortunately thrown into the wolves too early."
Someone alwas literally unironically calling anthony edwards a bust on here like 2 days ago. Like he's on the worst sports team in the history of all major sports (worst win % among all professional sports teams) and has been in the league for what 3 months?
If at some point we don't get Anthony Edwards vs Zion I'm going to die unhappy
"It's pretty hopeless to make sense of any rotation. Usually the end of the bench guys are vets who can mentor young players but ours are just more young players. I like what I see from McDaniels and Nowell but they probably are the only benefactors of being on such a shit team. In reality, they would probably be playing on two-way contracts for most teams.  Being completely realistic, Jaylen Nowell could not be any more one dimensional. Even on offense without the ball he just stands there. He looks good when he's hitting jumpers but when he's cold he is a complete negative.  Re: Anthony Edwards, I think he's exactly what people scouted and reported him to be: a charismatic athletic guard who can get to the rim and dunk but often has mental lapses and horrible shot selection. I hope he makes improvements but based on recent developments of other players (Culver, Okogie especially) it's hard to really get excited about any future with this team.  It especially sucks to see the roster that Rosas has built knowing he is nearing Kahn levels of winning %, and that we might have drafted the wrong guy (see: LaMelo), and we might be losing our draft pick to the Warriors."
"That's fair, a half dozen is an exaggeration. But we do see players just as freakishly athletic come in every year. Anthony Edwards, Obi Toppin, Devin Vassell just to name a few rookies off the top of my head from just this year with other world athleticism.  Regardless though. I don't even know how this is somehow a knock on Dwight. He's a phenomenal athlete. So is just about every great NBA player. That's how pro sports are"
"or maybe they could find like 3-4 guys who pride themselves on shot blocking who want to do it, so it's like a dunk contest and a shot-blocking contest at the same time. High stakes on both sides. Getting dunked on by Anthony Edwards on TV would suck, but if you rejected him, think of the glory."
I know Kelly Oubre has always refused because he says he’s more of an in-game dunker and likes dunking on people. Might be the same for Anthony Edwards.
Damn why did Anthony Edwards decline
And Anthony Edwards 2023
Anthony edwards has been growing on me fast
"Bruh no one ever saw Curry being as big as he became even in 2015. Curry was drafted in 2009. I can def see Luka, Zion (would have been guaranteed if he wasn't drafted by the Pelicans), Lamelo, Anthony Edwards all becoming big stars in the future. It's all about how good their teams become cause they have an exciting style of play and someone like Edwards has the personality to really blossom."
"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills the way people talk about him. I know he's only 19 but if you're the #1 pick in the draft then you get the criticism that comes along with that pick. He has been genuinely terrible so far.  Who are the #1 picks recently that have been worse than Edwards through half of their rookie season? The only ones in the past 20 years worse have been Markelle Fultz, Anthony Bennett, Andrea Bargnani, and Kwame Brown. Wiggins and Bogut are debatable but Edwards's advanced stats are garbage compared to them.  I saw a comment thread recently about Edwards vs. Haliburton and most people were saying they would still take Edwards over Haliburton headed forward. That is absolute nonsense. Haliburton is only 1 year older and making an actual impact every minute he's on the court. It would be foolish to take Edwards over Haliburton in a redraft.  I'm not writing him off completely, obviously it's still way too early for that, but it's fair to look at his poor performance so far and adjust expectations. All the criticisms about his game from college are all 100% spot on so far and that's a major cause for concern."
"Based on what I’ve seen on here, it’s unpopular to think that Anthony Edwards hasn’t been good."
"Cause Yuta is gorgeous.  Anthony Edwards noticed, just wanted to get closer to him."
Anthony Edwards is now the villain for Yuta the hero
"Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges are mature young guys, same with Jevon Carter.    I think Anthony Edwards has all the potential in the world, and KAT is an Elite talent.   They are worth keeping.     But everyone else is not good for the Timberwolves, including Malik Beasley.    It doesn't matter how many points you put up, if you character isn't gonna help the team. It would be smart to trade him.    Trade Rubio to the Clippers for Lou Will, T Mann, and Daniel Oturu"
"Boban and Steve with guest appearances from Jimmy Butler, Anthony Edwards and Klay Thompson."
Anthony Edwards needs to be a guest on one episode.
Anthony Edwards?
"The Pelicans don't play nearly as fast as we want them to, Zion plays a lot of time in the short corner and pretty much has no ball-handling responsibilities, and the team is just kind of blah in terms of record.   If the Pelicans played as fast as Milwaukee or Brooklyn, Zion would be averaging 28 a game and would have more highlights. Alternately, if the team was built around him, people would talk more about him leading the team. As it is, he plays a lot with two ball-handling guards and Ingram, so he's not really THE GUY like a lot of other stars are. Without looking it up, I bet Anthony Edwards has a higher usage than Zion."
Maxey is a project in the same sense that every rookie is a project. Nothing makes him any more of a project than say Anthony Edwards. There's a thousand ways he can improve but he's the real deal when it comes to rookies with upside.

"You see, they didn't select lamelo ball as a 1st pick, and instead they selected anthony edwards. Quite interesting, isn't it?"
"Anthony Edwards is gonna be really good too. His numbers definitely don't tell the whole story yet. He gets fouled when he gets to the rim all the time and gets almost no calls. He has good shot selection, and can create his own shot really well. He plays with effort and intensity on the defensive end too, more time in the league will only improve his skills on that end.   Nothing against LaMelo, and i'm not saying one is going to be better than the other, but Edwards has a lot to look forward to in this league."
"A lot of people are saying it’s too early, and they’re right. Just for fun I’ll take your benefit of the doubt and assume (prematurely) that Lamelo will have a much better career than Edwards, and explain why Edwards was picked first.   First off, Lamelo had some of the biggest red flags of a top 3 prospect I’ve seen in awhile. That’s not to say they weren’t overshadowed by his strengths, but his weaknesses were concerning. Known as a horrible defender, possessing a terrible shot form, uncertainty if he can run an offence properly WITHOUT it being extremely up tempo, terrible shoot IQ, among others. This isn’t to hate on Lamelo, I have been a fan of his for awhile, there just were some extremely big red flags. He’s clearly performed great, but he wasn’t risk free.   Anthony Edwards was a safer prospect, and the Wolves are in absolutely no position to take a gamble. They haven’t had any success apart from one playoff year with Butler, drafting Lamelo would have been a really bad decision without our revisionist history."
"so in your fantasy world they conducted a secret interview with finch about d'lo and anthony edwards ... without getting permission from the raptors ... while they still had a head coach. but also, to conduct secret interviews with other candidates would have been a ridiculous waste of time. great imagination you've got!"
"And of course there's about a 0.000000001% chance Rosas didn't talk to Finch about this hiring situation when the Raptors and Wolves played a 2-game series last week, either in Toronto or Minneapolis, especially since the Raptors were apparently given advanced warning. And its hard to imagine Anthony Edwards didn't come up in that conversation.  So, that makes this basically a *double* fail."
"Why do you keep saying year and a half when it was 1 year 9 months?   The team has changed, Anthony Edwards was not on the roster in 2019, neither was D'Lo or Culver. Also the candidates could have upskilled in the interim."
"&gt; It would be better to interview a wide range of candidates and give them all equal opportunity  They did that. Saunders finished #1 in that competition, and Finch finished #2.  MIN picked their #1. When that #1 was no longer viable, they then picked their #2.   If GS had Anthony Edwards #1 on their draft board, but he got picked by MIN ahead of their pick, should GS then have to re-workout and re-interview all the prospects in the draft? Or can they just pick the #2 guy on their board, based on their previous workouts and interviews?"
"C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid  PF: LeBron James / Giannis   SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kevin Durant  SG: Luka Dončić  / Bradley Beal  PG: Steph Curry / Trae Young  6: Damian Lillard / Nikola Vucevic  7: DeMar DeRozan / Jaylen Brown  8: Christian Wood / Kyle Lowry  9: SGA / Zach LaVine  10: Chris Paul / Sexton  11: Donovan Mitchell / Jerami Grant   12: De'Aaron Fox / Sabonis  13: Zion Williamson / Randle  14: Ja Morant / Jimmy Butler  15: KAT / Hayward  &amp;#x200B;  All things considered it's not a horrible idea, each team has an All Star caliber player on it's roster, but the problem is injuries and all star players underperforming . Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
"Levine, Zion, Anthony Edwards, Obi Toppin   End of discussion."
"It might be Anthony Edwards at this point. As far as I can tell, he’s generally rated as a top-3 rookie so far. After a good game, he was literally ranked 2nd on nba.com’s ROTY ranking and is still 3rd."
"Someone should show Anthony Edwards ""Snatch""."
LaMelo Ball Win Shares: 1.8  Anthony Edwards Win Shares: -0.7  Obviously judging them right now is extremely premature but after 30 games Ball has been way better and it's not particularly close
Anthony edwards is definitely the new school Gilbert arenas
nah bro anthony edwards can make some funny jokes and carry the whole team
Anthony Edwards for obvious reasons
hahahahahhaha Anthony Edwards is the man  also cheers to the reporter for keeping it flowing
Anthony Edwards doesn't
*By the order of Anthony fooking Edwards.*
The twist is Anthony Edwards is Irish all along.
Anthony Edwards nuff said.
"Anthony Edwards all over Reddit tonight with Irish appreciation. He also has 9 points on 3/13 shooting, 3/8 from 3s."
Anthony Edwards alone has two bigger yams than this. Not to discount the big man but this only maybe top five for me this year. Maybe I like the high fliers like LaVine better than big guys.

lamelo ball and anthony edwards annoy thr fuck out of me... they remind me of all the arrogant kids i went to hs with. theyre like the loud fortnite trashtalking 12 yr olds old enough to play in the nba
"You can say “Keep in mind” but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his “LA or bust” thing wasn’t even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don’t really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn’t been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."
Didn’t catch Anthony Edwards by surprise
Anthony Edwards converts that one
Tell that to Anthony Edwards
"LeBron, Jokic, Anthony Edwards"
Has anyone else noticed that most NBA highlights on the internet are sped up now?   NBA official youtube channel game highlights are all slightly sped up. This highlight is sped up. The Anthony Edwards highlight from the other day sped up.   I was like wow Booker is quick as hell but then I realized this was sped up.
Anthony Edwards windmills that
They like Anthony Edwards
"Anthony Edwards would have posterized Gobert on that play, en route to a 3-12 shooting night."
"Dont you mean lebron lowlights? Last game, lakers won, the posts were anthony edwards shoots over lebrons arm, LeBron crosses himself caruso saves the play, LeBron tries a fadeaway hits the side of the backboard. And most of those were in wins"
Anthony Edwards is a SF not a SG
"Anthony Edwards. Just starting a career, have the skills to become awesome. And can literally murder people with my athleticism"
"Anthony Edwards, he has the charisma, the must watch athleticism like Lebron or Jordan, and if he becomes a superstar it would be him."
Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards
"Anthony Edwards murdering Yuta would like a word with you, but this is definitely one of the better dunks this season"
It’s second to the Anthony edwards dunk and I’m a kawhi fan
"Anthony Edwards, just for his interviews."
"This draft is supposed to be so so so much better than 2020 draft but is it? Seems like most the prospects have many of the same warts. Jalen Suggs better then Anthony Edwards? Maybe but hes got to shoot better on the three.   It all comes down to effort from the newbies. Michael Jordan knew he had to have more muscle and be more physical so he worked his butt off and became the best basketball player ever.  Attitude, do these guys have it and how can a scout measure it?   I like Anthony Edwards and he has star potential and a physical presence."
"People treat him like a bust over here just because they expect a dude who essentially came out of high school without any sort of pro play for a year to be great. Before draft people were saying that the warriors picking Anthony Edwards, Wiseman or Lamelo would be fine but now all of a sudden the Warriors should’ve picked Lamelo because the rookie with little experience is playing like a rookie with little experience"
"Ready for the downvotes, but I find it corny as hell how RJ Barrett was deemed a bust in his first season, was snubbed from the all rookie team, and has basically been ignored for the majority of his sophomore season despite all his improvements because he was inefficient and on a bad team last year. Anthony Edwards rookie season so far is just as ""bad"" as RJ's rookie season statistically aside from PPG. He's even more inefficient and is on a worse team with a worse record than the Knicks last year but he has been getting nothing but praise and attention throughout this season and people are ready to call him rookie of the year (mostly because Lamelo is out).  The double standards are wack as hell. If people were ready to write RJ off as a 19 year old rookie why is that same energy not present for Anthony Edwards who is pretty much in the same exact situation? Miss me with all that man it's goofy. I'm sure Anthony Edwards is gonna have a solid season next year, but ROY of the discussion should be primarily about Lamelo Ball regardless of the games missed. Since apparently y'all care so much about the efficiency of a 19 year old rookie."
"The rankings:   **DPOY:**  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Bam Adebayo  **MVP:**   1. Nikola Jokic 2. Damian Lillard 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Joel Embiid 5. Steph Curry  Honorable mentions: Chris Paul, Lebron James, Donovan Mitchell, Luka Doncic, James Harden  **Rookie of the year:**  1. LaMelo Ball 2. Tyrese Haliburton 3. Anthony Edwards  **Sixth man of the year:**   1. Jordan Clarkson 2. Jalen Brunson 3. Joe Ingles  **Most improved player:**  1. Chris Boucher 2. Mikal Bridges 3. Christian Wood  **Coach of the year:**  1. Monty Williams 2. Quin Snyder 3. Mike Malone  If there's any specific questions about a ranking or omission, I can add that in the comments."
That was also the first thing I thought of when I saw Anthony Edwards talk about Wolves players needing to give more defensive effort
"Eh think there is something to guys now playing for reasons other than pure love of the sport. Like people thought Anthony Edwards couldnt be good because he likes things more than basketball. Feel like the point is more that money, fame, etc. are potentially motivating factors to become great players, just not hyper competitive player. Think OGs (players and fans) care more about that. Feel like that fact that there are no real NBA rivalries (maybe some player rivalries) is evidence at how the league is changing."
Lamelo Ball&gt;Anthony Edwards but both will be good
Anthony Edwards is now my favorite nba player.
Anthony edwards and scorimg 15 points in the 4th quarter to turn a blowout loss to a close loss.
"1. Injuries, this team played fully healthy in the first two games of the season but KAT's injury really derailed their season as a whole. We still don't know if the core of KAT, D'Lo, Edwards and Beasley is actually good because we have only seen them play for two games.  2. Coaching, Ryan Saunders probably made his gameplan around KAT and after he was injured he didn't have second plan. Hence D'Lo tried to carry this team but he failed miserably as only good teammate he had was Malik Beasley. (Anthony Edwards was pretty bad and inefficient.) He tried to implement a gameplan that obviously did not work, and he was fired after going 7-24. But in the great news, Chris Finch looks like he is a pretty great coach, at least after the ASB. The teams record is 6-10 after the All-Star Break and Edwards and KAT looks like completely different players. We knew what KAT was capable of but Edwards came in as a surprise as he is averaging 25 PPG with %54 TS after the all-star break.  3. While a trio of KAT, Edwards and D'Lo looks really good on the paper, basketball is a team sport at the end. Even if you score 60+ PPG as a trio every game, if your teammates are bad, you're not going to win the game. While they have great pieces like Jaden McDaniels, Malik Beasley and Naz Reid to an extent, other players are not helping. Jarrett Culver looks like he is a bust without confidence, Okogie is an offensive liability and Rubio, while his playmaking is still pretty good, he shoots %38 from the field. And the bad thing is I really don't know if they could fix this. We don't have a lot of trade pieces as our first round pick and second round picks were traded and I don't know if free agents would want to come to a team that is the worst team in the NBA.  4. KAT, Edwards and D'Lo are good, but their defense is really bad. To be fair, KAT and Edwards improved a little bit on that front, but they are still pretty bad. KAT improved his pick and roll defense and Ant gets a steal here and there but they just allowed 141 to an Indiana team that didn't have Sabonis, Turner or Brogdon. They are pretty [self-aware](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mmi27z/anthony_edwards_coach_cant_come_on_the_floor_he/) about their defensive problems and Edwards at least shows effort on that front but they still need to learn how to do team defense. We'll see if they will fix these problems in the off-season I guess."
That’s interesting because Anthony Edwards was recently talking all that shit.
"Do you want to know who are the guys which are even below Deni in this  VORP rank?  I will give you several names: Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, Isaac Okoro  Patrick Williams, Killian Hayes aren't much higher than Avdija.  Basically all top-10 selected rookies playing big enough minutes per game except Lamelo...  Yes... send them all to G-League"
"RJ:  45/38/74  Anthony Edwards:  39/31/78  lets not forget RJ is on a playoff team, and Ant is on the second worst team in the league  i believe Ant will be a great player, but you’ve let RJ live rent free in your head in this thread  lets just appreciate both players... i love ant!"
"It's so important that Anthony Edwards is open about his opinion to the press. He has the right character to say these things without it being a personal attack.   Also, Wolves have no hope in restoring their culture behind the scene. They gotta bring things to light."
I mean that’s not true if you watch basketball but you don’t. I’m not talking about Anthony Edwards. I’m talking about LaMelo Ball not being a top 3 player under 25 or how he projects because 1. He isn’t and 2. He just isn’t that good relative to the dudes he was ranked above
We’re gonna hear about it for months from Bill Simmons if Anthony Edwards wins
Anthony “Despite the loss” Edwards
"Theo is 6th.   Poku, Patrick Williams, LaMelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, Killian Hayes, then Theo"
"I’m a big fan of his confidence. It’s hard to rationalize in a way because it’s just a feeling you get, but I like his competitive vibe.   Wiggins is doing really well now but Anthony Edwards seems to basically have the mentality people were always hoping Wiggins had, that confidence that even borders on arrogance just a little bit, but in a good way. I think Edwards’ second season will be really impressive."
Really hope that the Timberwolves can make something happen with Anthony Edwards and KAT
"Anthony Edwards has to become a star. His quotes and press conferences are too good, he’s gotta be in the spotlight."
"Anthony Edwards and going off in the 4th quarter of a blow out to make the game close, but ultimantly a loss. Name a more iconic duo."
Anthony Edwards in shambles
Anthony Edwards
"Anthony Edwards will be the best player in the 2020 NBA Draft, and will be a perennial All-Star leading the league in scoring for many years to come."
Anthony edwards has been future goat for me since 2017 lol
Anthony Edwards is the closest thing we’ve had to harden
When Tate was a freshman in college Anthony Edwards and Lamelo were like 12 or 13
Elite defender Anthony Edwards
"First, there is an implied assumption that Anthony Edwards, specifically, will need to shoot a lot better to become an all-star. I think that's a fact; he's not Sabonis, Giannis, or Ben Simmons.   Second, you're absolutely right that the big limitation of this analysis is the lack of consideration of volume. Obviously, shooting 37% on five attempts per game is more impressive (and likely requires a ""better"" shooter) than shooting 39% on two attempts per game."
"I was so pissed he missed that, after all the anthony edwards and lamelo highlights I was hoping for him to get one"
"Give me your top-10. Not saying you're wrong, just interested to see who you got over him. Hali, Ball, Edwards and Wiseman are obvious choices, Jalen McDaniels is quite good, Poku has been decent post ASG, but is still shooting horribly, same can be said about Anthony and Maledon. Avdija is okay but not spectacular and I'm kinda blanking on who else could be in the top-10, it's not that deep of a draft."
The argument against Anthony Edwards is that he's had a good year for a rookie while Haliburton and LaMelo have had good and great years period. Edwards looks like a great player for the future but there are rookies who are actually better right now.
"I'm just not sure what the case is for Anthony Edwards at this point. No one is saying he can't become great, or won't become great, but right now Haliburton has just been the better player.  Edwards: 18/4/3 on 39/31/79 (46 eFG%) - 61% of his shots are jump shots   Haliburton: 13/3/5 on 48/42/88 (59 eFG%) - 81% of his shots are jump shots  Efficiency is the talking point in the difference statistically. Haliburton is taking a significantly higher amount of his shots as jump shots and shooting significantly better. Edwards is an inefficient scorer, Haliburton has been elite in terms of efficiency. Edwards has an AST/TO ratio of 1.2. Haliburton has an AST/TO ratio of 3.4."
Anthony Edwards.
"Eddie griffin, Rashad McCants, Shabazz Muhammad, Michael Beasley, isaiah rider, Stephen Marbury,  Troy Hudson, laphonso Ellis, Anthony edwards, Gary Trent"
This reminds me of people who state don't worry about rookies having a lot of interceptions because Peyton Manning did his rookie year. Ya but his team was terrible and he still had almost 3800 yards which was a lot at the time and he was improving as the season went on. With Anthony Edwards he is on a bad team but I wouldn't compare him to Lebron man that is just going to open up for criticism. I would look at Zach Lavine and Booker who were inefficient at the start and became very efficient later on.
"I feel like those takes were similar to some on this sub, where they just say Wiseman is terrible and you can tell they haven’t watched him.  He’s negative impact, but so is Anthony Edwards, and many other rookies. The problem is, his team has way higher expectations than any other lotto team.  He still has shown flashes of his talent, and he’s had games where he’s put it together."
"Just started getting into buying jerseys of players i like around the league, Anthony Edwards might be my next grab. Love his game and personality"
"Honestly it seems like the Timberwolves are letting Edwards go off on a high volume to try to develop him but more importantly tank. I don't know why he takes more shots than KAT other than for that reason. Rookie players like Haliburton, Tate, Melo, and Quickly have made their teams better while they are out on the floor. Anthony helps the Timberwolves tank."
Anthony Edwards is a force of nature figuring it out.  Where is the Suns fan arguing with me that Edwards is the next Josh Jackson the night before he put up 42 points?
"It's possible that RJ instigated it but I doubt it. Anthony just called it as it was. That being said, RJ didn't seem to care and he probably will only work on improving. No one, even Anthony Edwards, thinks RJ is a bad player. He even says that if RJ had made the shot, they all had to live with it. Because he's still an NBA player."
"I get that you have Stockholm Syndrome from watching Anthony Edwards take 17 shots to make 7 every night, but 7-19 is a bad game."
Anthony Edwards is 6’5 230. That’s built like a tank.
"Bro it was the teams plan not Anthony Edwards. The entire team decided and agreed that RJ Barrett was the one they wanted to take the shot. Or do you think he just made all that shit up just to piss RJ off? Like explain your reasoning behind what was said if it wasn't a calculated plan by the entire team. It doesn't even come off like shit talk, it reads like a risky plan (cause anyone could still make the shot, this is the NBA after all) that worked out because they played their odds.  Like far-be-it from me to judge the plan of an NBA team that actually worked from my desk."
"Fuck no. I'm saying I'm on Anthony Edwards side in this. It wasn't shit talk it was a legit plan based on a weakness that ended up winning the game. Like I said, if the enemy team views you as a weakness, that's on you."
Watch Anthony Edwards play then watch D Lo play.
"You’re touching on something else I’ve been thinking about with the “potential” of the rookie award. I feel like rookie of the year voters more than ever don’t want to vote for the guy that ends up looking silly in hindsight, even when it is a defensible choice in the moment, like when MCW got the award because the Process 76ers used him way too much because they were processing. Not that Haliburton is by any means MCW, it’s just the risk here is that Haliburton turns out to be a very good player and Anthony Edwards becomes the next Dwayne Wade and either you regret it personally or professionally as a voter. So this helps Ant over Haliburton too, and to an extent probably isn’t fair, but that’s what it is."
"The thing is, he's twenty. He can't even buy a drink or legally smoke weed in the state of California, and playing on a team who's still trying to compete even. His mental game is simply different than someone like Lamello, who pretty much lived in a spotlight for most of his life, or Anthony Edwards, who's on the Timberwolves and at least having some good people to help grow in the game without much expectations set on the team as whole, at least my take with armchair pyschology"
[You sure?](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ml0gtb/rj_barret_despite_the_loss_22_points_4_rebounds/)  &gt;Rj had a nice game despite the L. He was hitting shots late **(Anthony Edwards in shambles)**   &gt;Man he should've taken the game winner. Would've been perfect after his response to **edwards** earlier today  Seems like he's rent free in some people's head.
Yeah I was with him 'cause the rockets stan is wilding but Anthony Edwards for Simmons is crazy. Edwards is oozing with potential and at this point Simmons is a known commodity. Wolves aren't winning in the immediate future so they're sure as hell not mortgaging their future on 4 extra wins on the season lmao
&gt; Wiseman is legitimately the worst starter in the league by a huge margin  Never watched Anthony Edwards I guess. It's sad but they're at about the same level in terms of impact.  Or is this sub still going to tell me that the sky isn't blue about that kid because he can run fast and jump high and score 20 points when you give him 16-18 shots?
Anthony edwards
"For a franchise that is so often horrible, they've managed to have a lot of VERY talented players.   Garnett. Kevin Love. KAT, Jimmy Buckets. Spreewell. Anthony Edwards. LaVine. Mayo.  And for a franchise that has done so well in the draft,, they have also done REALLY bad.   They drafted KG and Allen, who would go onto win a title together... for another team!  Sure... they got KAT, Edwards, LaVine, Garnett, Allen, Mayo, Pekovic.  &amp;#x200B;  But they pass up on Steph (in favour of Johnny Flynn), draft Lauri but trade him and picked him over Mitchell, missed out on Herro. Got Wiggins in the Love trade instead of Embiid (though that was Cleveland's fault).   &amp;#x200B;  I don't know what to make of that franchise's lack of luck."
"Seriously, he watches games, but definitely not as many or as intensively as someone like Zach Lowe. Like how many Twolves does any really think he's caught from start to finish and actually focused in on Anthony Edwards?"
"Anthony ""compound eyes"" Edwards"
Anthony Edwards is a bust?
"Wiseman, despite being a net negative right now, is still a top 5 value rookie lol  Don’t mix up his inability to help a winning team, with not having value. Even Anthony Edwards is a negative impact player right now, and to suggest he has no value would be ludicrous."
"Perhaps he didn’t intend to throw shade, but that’s not what he “just said”.  “Gladly RJ caught it and if he made the shot, we would’ve lived with it,” Timberwolves rookie Anthony Edwards said. “Because that’s who we wanted taking the shot. We didn’t want anyone else taking it.”   Seems pretty apparent what he meant by it; don’t think it’s a big deal but why paint it as something it isn’t?"
Poku &gt; Wiseman &gt; Anthony Edwards don't @ me
&gt;Minnesota Timberwolves-helps their defense and really would benefit with the spacing and playmaking KAT offers   Beasley and Anthony Edwards are starting over him any day of the week lol
"back when Anthony Edwards baptized Watanabe I said his dunk looked like [what T-Mac did to Shawn Bradley in the playoffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOcdOF04-wk).  Some Pistons flair replied to me saying that he could've pulled the T-mac dunk off when he was in college.  Without a doubt, the most asinine thing I have ever heard on r/nba.   Edited to find a better quality video (sorry, it happened in 2005, lived sports were filmed via potato back then)"
"Anthony Edwards has improved since the start of the season, so throw those stats out."
"Anthony Edwards has improved since the start of the year. He is not the same player anymore.   Rj Barrett is improved from last year, but current Edwards &gt; current RJ"
"1st team is probably Edwards, LaMelo, Haliburton, Tate, and Bey. 2nd team probably Quickley, Wiseman, Anthony, Williams, and Bane."
Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards would absolutely thrive
"Better question would be what metrics do you use to evaluate defenses? None of them are both relatively consistent year to year and predictive, which means it's pretty tough to use them in analysis. What I can tell you is that Okoro has played more minutes than every rookie not named Anthony Edwards, and has spent most of those minutes guarding the opponent's best perimeter player. Only other recent rookie I can think of with that responsibility is Lu Dort. I can also tell you that his defensive metrics aren't dog shit despite having almost no good defenders on our team. We were solid defensively early in the year, and there were 5 reasons for that. One of them was coaching. Then there was the surprise factor, as nobody expected us to be good so they didn't really prep for us. Then there was Javale McGee protecting the rim. Then there was Larry Nance Jr. being a disruptor. And finally, there was Okoro actually doing a pretty good job of limting the production of the oppoent's superstar. We already went through this business with Sexton and Garland. Advanced stats don't do a good job of measuring young leaders of bad teams. They can't differentiate the legit from the bullshit. But watch some of our games and then tell me Okoro isn't legit."
"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
"Anthony Edwards, he has the ceiling of being one of the most elite scorers in the league."
Anthony Edwards
I thought mudiay would come out playing like what we're seeing from anthony edwards now .
"Then call it both ways. You can’t call that a blocking foul, and then push Anthony Edwards in mid air while he’s shooting and just say “well learn how to play the game”"
Anthony Edwards is da truth y'all. Love his game. GG
"For reference Tatum was at 55 true shooting his second year on far fewer ppg. Tatum is also currently at 56 true shooting on the same ppg as Anthony edwards post all star break, a very manageable improvement for him over next year and the year after imo if he can keep this level of ppg."
"Dame, Anthony Edwards, Lonzo, and Miles Bridges off the top of my head"
"&gt; How have your takes on the other rookies gone?  Lamelo/Haliburton-- bang on. Absolutely right.  Wiseman. Wrong, thought he would be better.  Anthony Edwards. Depends how you look at it-- I thought he was overrated, and he was, but he has exceeded my expectations.  Bey. I thought he'd be good, he's better than I thought.  Patrick Williams/Deni Avidja/Poku/Isiaih Stewart pretty much as I predicted or better and worse.  RJ Hampton. Maybe wrong, I thought he would contribute, he should see more time with the Magic so we'll see.  Okongwu/Hayes I thought they'd be bad, I didn't think they would be that bad."
Love Anthony edwards so much honestly
It’s not really that good of a dunk it’s just the players have beef so it’s exciting. If you want to see some legit dunks from this season check out [this dunk by Anthony Edwards](https://youtu.be/iODDxjp936A) or [this dunk by Jaxson Hayes](https://youtu.be/OjrClzgv2Ls)
Future Utah Jazz Superstar Anthony Edwards
How is this relevant to Anthony Edwards?
"Anthony Edwards guarding Simmons like he's Steph Curry, rookie mistake of forgetting personnel"
"Anthony Edwards literally ended a man's soul. That dunk isn't just the best dunk of the season, it's probably the best dunk since the 2000 Olympics."
Anthony Edwards is nice with it god damn bro
Nah Anthony Edwards still dunk of the year for me.
23 points for Anthony Edwards on 21 shots
"That wouldn’t change the narrative at all, he’d look even worse. He’s been castigated as “soft” for so long that he either drags Minnesota out of the dirt or he’ll never be respected.   I personally think Anthony Edwards is the one who’s actually capable of doing that. The real Azor Ahai, if you will."
"Well, Anthony Edwards wasn’t available at 2..."
"""Take time to develop"" is such a vague statement though.  When youre the number 2 pick thats supposed to mean ""at times he looks like the best player on the court, but in general he's still a negative impact player and has a ways to go before he consistently contributes to winning"" (like what we see from anthony edwards basically)   With Wiseman he is so far away from even that point.  Hes playing like a late lottery project type pick"
"Was Wiseman the best choice? Why not LaMelo or Anthony Edwards, Haliburton.."

&gt; The Memphis Grizzlies (24 - 23)  We are 23 - 23   Great team win by our boys. Everyone that got good minutes contributed. KAT and Anthony Edwards were beasts tonight. Onto Philly.
Anthony Edwards but I like Ball too
Anthony Edwards and it's barely debateable.
Anthony Edwards is one of the funniest player in the NBA because he's a rookie and just says whatever he's thinking. sucks if he becomes a star he'll probably go through intense media training and stop being funny
Lmao Anthony Edwards was like 3 words away from a PR disaster
"Saying that Anthony Edwards is the leading scorer among rookies isn't twisted or cherry picked lol if anything that's a major deal for the ROY award, which seems to be largely influenced by basic stuff like that, in the same way that the 6MOY award is almost always just the guy who scored the most points while coming off the bench regardless of anything else."
Just about every statline is historic in some way these days. Anthony Edwards is probably the only rookie to make 8 threes in a 40-5-5 game on 90% TS .
"Anthony Edwards has shot 50% from the field or better 17 times this season in 70 games played.   LaMelo Ball has shot 50% from the field or better 19 times in 49 games played.   Am I doing the arbitrary, cherrypicked stats thing right?"
Anthony Edwards is good but not a sure fire superstar.

"Anthony Edwards is gonna be everything the Wolves thought Wiggins was gonna be and more. But on a different note, please for the love of god stop putting KAT up there with Jokic and Embiid."
Anthony Edwards is a big reason for that. He leaves shooters open all day.
Anthony Edwards is gonna be Lebron with a three point shot early in his career. Someone hit me with a remindme for five years from now
"Respectfully there is a world of difference between the Wolves situation vs the Pistons. Minn arguably has 4 different players who could go to Detroit and lead your team in scoring (KAT, DLo, Edwards Beasley) and all of them are aged 25 or younger. They also have one of the largest trade assets in the league , a 25yo All-NBA player Karl Anthony Towns, IF they chose to go that route he's worth more than some teams entire rosters.   They certainly need a few more guys who can play D, but they aren't starving for a franchise player with this pick the way Detroit, Houston, Orlando, Cleveland are. Imo the biggest need for them is a full offseason to get healthy and gel with their new coach."
James Harden was Anthony Edwards before Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards is scary af
Anthony Edwards is a problem.
"Anthony edwards is not gonna be really good, he is really good"
Anthony Edwards is single handedly willing the Timberwolves back into this game
"Cade averaging more turnovers than assists is a big red flag for me.   His overall offensive rating in college was slightly lower than Anthony Edwards' was, and that's despite a big knock against Edwards being that he had bad shot selection."
Michael Jordan is Anthony Edwards' real Jimmy Butler? I gotta say I liked it better the first way
I prefer the “Michael Jordan is Anthony Edwards’ real father” train
"KAT is going to request a trade, but it's not gonna be because the Wolves are bad.  He's gonna request a trade because the pressure of playing next to Anthony Edwards, a bonafide superstar and the new face of the NBA once Lebron retires, will be too much for him to handle.  He's gonna look at Edwards and say ""My god, this kid is Zion with a jumper. If I don't help deliver multiple championships for this kid, the national media is gonna excoriate me."""
"Here before the ""Anthony Edwards caused this"" typa comments"
I'm still going to go with Anthony Edwards for playing the whole season.  Ball's stats don't even show up in the leaders because he hasn't played enough games.
"If lamelo played 60+ games I’d give it to him. His counting stats are great, had team success and is one of the most exciting players in the league. I would tune in to hornets games to watch him and my man miles.   I think Anthony edwards should win, and would easily if he came out of the gate putting up his averages of the past couple months.. but he didn’t. I wouldn’t be mad if lamelo got it from him.   Really excited to see how it all plays out!"
One of the dudes on his podcast put Anthony edwards second rookie team LOL
"I think your underselling how bad Anthony Edwards was pre ASB. he might have been the worst player in the NBA. He's been better post ASB then LaMelo was before it by a healthy margin, but if his first half turns people off of his RoTY chances its completely understandable, to me at least."
Anthony “The Moment” Edwards
"I mean I’m not gonna lie and say I watch every game but I at least try to tune into other teams games and not just mavs, Celtics, nets, Nuggets. You got hoards of Lakers fans calling rj a bad shooter because of that game he had last night. Then you got people saying maybe Anthony Edwards was right even though rj literally hit the game tying shot on Ja morant a few games after. They say these generalizations and then this sub eats it up like it’s facts"
Anthony Edwards has the most potential out of anyone in this league. It’s up to him to live up to it tho.
"OP a few days ago: the ROTY debate is so toxic, I'm done talking about it   Also OP: posts the Rookie Ladder every week and has 10+ posts per week involving Anthony Edwards"
If you're arguing full season then how is Lamelo not clearly #1? He's been way more efficient than Edwards overall this season. Also Anthony has been pretty bad on defense overall whereas LaMelo has been average to slightly above average.
"For the people downvoting me:  Click the full list and look at a couple things. DeMar's ratio may be the highest but he's not in the top 50 players for passes made. He is right above Anthony Edwards for passes made this season.  Combine his low number of passes with this league leading ratio and you see a pretty clear picture of a selfish passer.  To contrast, Nikola Jokic has thrown the most passes in the league BY FAR and his ratio is only 11%. Jokic is #5 in potential assists too meaning that his passes are not all potential assists.   If you look at the ratio of passes to potential assists, Jokic is: 18%, DeRozan is: 37.2%.  Very clearly selfish passing."
"You know there is actually a problem when you score under 40 pts, no triple double, and this sub makes an entire post about the game you had.    Great game for him but if this was Anthony Edwards does it even get it’s own post?"
"It definitely wouldn't for most draft picks, but for guys like Wiseman who are drafted so high, I think there's a potential it could. It did for guys like Anthony Bennet, and several other high picks that were busts.   I'm not saying Wiseman is a bust, I think he has the potential to be a very good player. I just don't think sending him to the G League is the right move.   Rookies like Anthony Edwards were allowed to make a ton of mistakes early on in the season and eventually they adjusted to the rotation. Warriors being a playoff team, Wiseman wasn't able to have that freedom. It's easy to say that sending him to the G-League will give that for him, I don't think it will.   Another major aspect is just the team's relationship with Wiseman and his agent. Sending such a highly-touted draft pick to the G-League (when he could easily be averaging 20 and 10 on a lottery team, similar to the big numbers Edwards is able to put up on the Wolves) is sending a bad message. We want to be able to develop Wiseman and eventually extend/re-sign him, and we can't offend him and his agent in the process."
That final possession is why Anthony Edwards said what he said
I agree with Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards nods
Anthony Edwards was right about RJ
Anthony Edwards is laughing right now
Anthony edwards driving down the lane reminds me of bron sometimes
Any team with anthony edwards has a bright future
"I live in Ohio, my first time ever sitting down and really getting invested in a basketball game was watching LeBron and the Cavs get bounced out of the playoffs by the Magic. Decide I'm going to start giving a shit about basketball because I never cared that much about watching any sports before that. LeBron makes his ***Decision*** and heads to South Beach. Young child version of me now views LeBron as a traitor and hates him. Randomly stumble upon the Thunder, fall in love with KD. Also really enjoy Harden, and to a lesser degree Russ and Serge. Harden gets traded, Serge gets traded, KD ends up leaving so I decide I'm done with the Thunder since none of the guys I actually loved are on the team anymore, decide I'm going to be a fan of whatever team KD joins........ except for **THAT** team. Can't be the biggest bandwagon fan of all time, despite having a decent excuse for following KD to GSW. Decide I'm going to find another group of promising young studs that I can hitch my wagon to before they blow up and I can watch them grow throughout their careers and hopefully we can all flourish together. Those promising young studs? KAT and Wiggins..... at least one of them is panning out.   Now I'm just here, living in Ohio, rooting for Minnesota and banking on Anthony Edwards to turn this franchise around forreal and lead us to the promised lands.... or at least the playoffs. Still not a LeBron guy but I don't hate him like I did when I was a kid. Still a big KD guy tho. Also, love Luka Doncic."
Lamelo misses 19 games everyone says he is gonna win. Embiid missed 19 games everyone says he doesn’t deserve it lmao Anthony edwards is by far has had the best season
Anthony Edwards so we can get a Bomb acceptance speech.
"Who is he replacing on this list: Ball, Edwards, Haliburton, Patrick Williams, JaeSean Tate, Saddiq Bey, Quickley, Okoro, Bane, Cole Anthony, Campazzo, Stewart, Jaden McDaniels, Wiseman. He’s gotta be better than 4 people to make it"
Sources say A-Rod was offended Anthony Edwards didn't know who he was
"Let me give another example that would be similar to what Bazemore said.  ""Damn what a performance by Anthony Edwards. ROTY for sure. Other guys fracturing wrists, trying to keep up.""   Pretty disrespectful if you ask me."
Anthony Edwards stats since D'Angelo Russell returned 18 games ago:  Points: 22.7 Rebounds: 6.1 Assists: 3.7 Steals: 1.4 3P: 35.6% 2P: 56.0% TS: 58.0% (above league-average) USG: 26.3%  So that's 23-6-4 on above-average efficiency and high usage. Wolves are 9-9 over that stretch  https://twitter.com/DaneMooreNBA/status/1391827752144211976
They aren’t wrong either lol it’s just been terrible decisions after terrible decisions. Just this last decade they had a bright future then flip died and they gave thibs the job and he traded half their future for a rental in Jimmy and then Jimmy tanks his value and trashes the franchise on his way out and they don’t get proper value for what he was worth. In the end it kind of worked out because they were able to turn Jimmy into Roco who turned into Beasley Juancho and Jaden mcdaniels who’s looking very promising and they ended up getting Anthony Edwards. This might be the beginning of something new for the Timberwolves
Anthony Edwards is gonna be 29 in 2030. He's gonna be good for a long time
"Give Anthony Edwards the athleticism boost, go full cartoon mode."
"Athleticism boost: KAT, making him faster and stronger would make him the best C in the league, giving him tools to be a paint bully which he ain't, with 40% 3pt shooting he already has.  Skill Boost: Rubio, if he could shoot 40% 3s and score from midrange reliably, he would be a REAL problem, because he has the passing/defense already.  3"" boost: Anthony Edwards, then he would become Lebron in physical dominance and we could play him as 2, 3 or 4 depending on the lineup."
1: Anthony Edwards 2: Naz Reid 3: Jaden McDaniels   ...then burn the list

They do but most promotion is done by the team and other media. Just look at how Anthony Edwards made his name this season
Which is a bit silly considering modern positionless basketball. Anthony Edwards comes to mind.
Anthony Edwards seems to have ROTY locked up but Facu is probably finishing top 3 or at least top 5. No other rookie has had the kind of impact he has had on a team with as high of a winning percentage.
Kyrie was like 2-3 years in with the bummy cavs. That’s like saying Anthony edwards record is trash before having someone like Lebron would join
"Lol the fact that you’re downvoted just because Tatum played terrible last game, but someone saying Anthony Edwards is upvoted, shows how much clowns there are in this sub.   While Zion may have more potential, Luka is the only young player better than Tatum atm."
Anthony Edwards didn’t scream or flex at all whatsoever so idk what the fuck point you think you’re making lmaoooo
I think he is easily the best athlete of the top prospects and already has a nice jumper as well. His explosiveness reminds me of Anthony Edwards altho he's not quite as physically strong as Edwards is/was so that's a bit of a concern.
"After having looked through r/nba more than I had before, I noticed a trend of a disproportionate amount of attention going to Jokic and Doncic. However, I also noticed crazy amounts of attention going to guys like Anthony Edwards. Overall, I think that the sub has a bunch of players it really likes to focus on, but I’m now more inclined to agree that skin color plays a role in determining those players. It’s my fault I got overly defensive. I just wasn’t expecting this sort of thing in this sub. I’ve seen people make a big deal over players being white, like Steven A. Smith making a big deal about “those two white dudes” on the Heat, or an article I saw somewhere that ranked the best white players in basketball while claiming it wasn’t just Republican, white nationalist propaganda, but I didn’t think that there were fans like that. I try to determine a player’s merit only based on their stats and quality of play, unless they’re a Heat player. If Bam Adebayo was a top 10 NBA player, I would constantly be calling him MVP. I still think he needs more DPOY consideration."
There have been so many Anthony Edwards threads the last week lol.
That’s this years #1 overall pick Anthony Edwards
For actual garbage time the [guy with the most points scored in it is Anthony Edwards](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/player?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;Leverage=Low). And it's not a high enough % that I really care.
And then get swept in the finals by Anthony Edwards Twolves
"But you just said screaming and flexing alone is not acting tough. Those were your own words. Therefore the only thing that changes it is staring down your opponent, like Anthony Edwards did.   Screaming and flexing is not acting tough. Staring down your opponents is. That's your own logic, not mine. You are agreeing with me."
it feels like theres an overwhelming amount of young talent thats come into the league the past couple years. like theyre all so good right away. nobody’s even talking about anthony edwards tearing it up recently cause lamelo is back and hes balling.
Add Anthony Edwards to the mix
Anthony Edwards definitely funniest man in the league
Chris Finch and Anthony Edwards :D
&gt;It absolutely is acting tough when you’re looking directly at the guy you just dunked on   You mean like Anthony Edwards did to Watanabe?? LMAO you just agreed with me  That's checkmate homie. I got you with your own logic. GG
"KD-lite? Lmao.   1. He didn’t choose the wolves. He was traded. 2. He didn’t choose the Sixers he was traded. 3. He went from a team that lost a game 7 to a team that was 10th in the East and made it to the finals the next season.  Just go enjoy your super team of Anthony Edwards, KAT, and D’Lo and hope that you don’t get a pick out of the Top 3."
"I think Anthony Edwards is great but if you’re saying “they should double team him,” (which implies he isn’t being doubled) and then go onto say “no other rookie has earned that respect,” then clearly he hasn’t earnt that respect because he’s not being doubled..."
"Honestly pretty much every reddit nba fanbase probably has hella weirdos but yeah the wolves fans definitely seem to be the saltiest bunch Ive seen by far lmao. It's whatever though, I don't even dislike their team or anything lol I've been kinda a fan of KAT for a while and Anthony Edwards is really likable too."
"Wiseman has a higher TS% than both Lamelo and Anthony Edwards, and played the entirety of his rookie season as a 19-year old. He fell into that while clearly struggling in the mental game.   It would be wise to give things time to play out. There’s a decent chance all three end up really good."
Says the man who is religiously in every Anthony Edwards thread? I could make an off-season compilation of every thread you've been in where you hated on Ant or Wolves for no good reason other than that he threatens to dethrone LaMelo lol
"We've been bad for a year, the Timberwolves haven't been relevant since Anthony Edwards was a toddler"
anthony edwards reminds me of jimmy butler lmao

"Lol, I guarantee you Jimmy Butler is not afraid of Anthony Edwards."
"With Anthony Edwards taking over in Minnesota, KAT can finally leave the timberwolves and play for a better  team without looking like a bad guy"
It's not a difference of opinion what happened on the court. That is something that you can see with your eyes. I didn't exaggerate. I explained exactly what happened. There is video evidence of it.   Did Anthony Edwards not turn to stare down the guy on the floor he just dunked on? Where was I mistaken.  Go ahead I'll wait.
"I know everyone is probably sick of Anthony Edwards threads, but he has a pretty good shot to reach 5000 points before he turns 22. He wont turn 22 untill the summer between his 3rd and 4th season, so he has 2 full more seasons to reach it. He'll need to average about 22.3 points per game and not get hurt over the next 2 years to reach 5000 in April of 2022, so super possible. Really puts into perspective how young he is."
"Martin just yelled from the hype. Anthony Edwards actually turned around after he got up to stare down Watanabe while he was on the ground. How is that not acting tough? That's probably the most ""fake tough"" thing you can do lmao. Staring down a guy while hes on the floor and cant do anything screams fake tough guy."
You’re trippin. in no way shape or form was Anthony edwards acting like a tough guy. not even close to what Martin did lmao
Anthony Edwards on Watanabe? Edwards turn to stare him down while Watanbe is still on the ground. Probably said something to him too. Guess that dunk is lame now huh?
"The fact that Lamelo got nearly 80 first place votes and Anthony Edwards only got 15 tells the whole story. Whoever voted didn’t watch any basketball other than highlights of the first 20 games.   These awards and voters are trash. Please get rid of it all and start over from scratch and make consistent, quantifiable criteria for these awards"
"A 6ers fan talked shit to me today about how LaMelo was light years better than Anthony Edwards. Blame that dude, Philly."
So we all admit Anthony edwards is thoughtless? Or is he dumb. He needs to be one.
Lamelo and Anthony Edwards playing basketball
"Charlotte is the 10th largest market in the NBA. Minny is in the bottom 25%. Lavar Ball has been a household name within NBA circles for the last 5 years. LaMelo had the most hype, played well, got hurt. Anthony Edwards played the whole year and got better as it went. LaMelo is going to be a good NBA player, Anthony Edwards is going to be a perennial All Star in the league. Keep the trophy, Ant has his eyes on a different one."
LaMelo deserved it. Anthony Edwards can become the better player for sure though
Laughs in Anthony Edwards  Melo deserved it. But I still think Anthony is going to have the better career
Okay riddle me this: Does the post have anything to do with Anthony Edwards?
"""Context to what? A post that has nothing to do with Anthony Edwards?""   Someone couldn't make the connection. Looks like you need a brain, pal."
"Anthony Edwards averaged 15.0 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists in December 2020, on 52% TS    Anthony Edwards averaged 13.3 points, 3.2 rebounds and 1.9 assists in January on 46% TS    Anthony Edwards averaged 16.1 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.3 assists in 16 games in February 2021, on 46.5% TS   Should be noted he was around 25 minutes per game under ryan saunders, who was the coach during this period"
"Yes, dimwit, I can see the superficial connection. He posted a projected stat-line from a post that had nothing to do with Anthony Edwards."
Context to what? A post that has nothing to do with Anthony Edwards?
"i just don’t see what point you’re making. you can’t say it’s all media hype when anthony edwards was the consensus number 1 and dunking on people most of the year. both guys had a ton of highlights. you still can’t rationalize why zion didn’t get more votes either when lamelo and him both missed huge chunks of time. the mental gymnastics you’re doing trying to be right when i’m not even advocating lamelo was better, i’m just saying how the voters vote. you having a bad day my man?  i have no dog in the race and yet you’re still just twisting scenarios when media hype comes into play and when it doesn’t? is that something you solely decide for everyone? lol"
LaMelo didn't even play 20 games. Was I better than Anthony Edwards at the beginning of the season?
The Timberwolves could put together a package with Anthony Edwards and picks.  Something like Russell/Edwards/picks for Giannis.
"As a hornets fan, I'd first like to thank my mom...  Seriously though, Anthony Edwards is a beast and is deserving of this award as well. But I'm glad my boy melon got it, and I've never been more excited as a hornets fan.  Be warned NBA, you will get bonked and you will go to horny jail next season."
"Anthony Edwards had a better season, and yes - health matters. But LaMelo had the early hype and it was always going to be tough to overcome that. Votes are won in the social media atmosphere, not on the court necessarily"
"First Justin Jefferson, now Anthony  Edwards"
"I find 538 RAPTOR and Bball Index's LEBRON to be the two best advanced stats publicly available. Definitely far better than RPM, VORP, PER, etc.  -  [**538 RAPTOR**](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)      LaMelo Ball:      +1.2 OFF | –0.9 DEF | +0.3 TOTAL (+2.3 WAR)     Anthony Edwards:  –0.5 OFF | –2.8 DEF | -3.3 TOTAL (–0.7 WAR)  -  [**Bball Index LEBRON**](https://www.bball-index.com/lebron-database/)      LaMelo Ball:      +0.17 OFF | –0.68 DEF | –0.50 TOTAL     Anthony Edwards:  +0.91 OFF | –1.81 DEF | –0.90 TOTAL"
&gt;  Hopefully this motivates Ant and he takes off next year.  *monkey’s paw clutches  Headline: Anthony Edwards to sit out 21/22 NBA season to focus on rap career
"That might be your point, which is a valid one, but that was not what the person I was responding to was saying.  This is the sentence:   ""Edwards valleys this rookie season where his shooting percentages were utterly horrific are something LaMelo didn't really suffer through.""  That is not a true statement.  What you said is true, but you are giving WAY too much credit to the dude I was responding to.  What you said and what he said are totally different.  You actually had reasoning and context, just blanket saying ""Lamelo didn't suffer through poor shooting stretches but Anthony Edwards did"" is not a true statement"
"Ant gon use this as that Tom Brady motivation and fuel. I’m for it. Tape the headline in his lunch pail. Always next year Mr. ANTHONY Edwards. They can’t keep the RoY from you forever.   Loki he gon work his butt off till it’s Thor  and hire an Asguardian.   Win a RoY, and a Chip,   then show the Vikings’ who’s partyin."
If you think national writers have their thumb on the Wolves then I have a beach-side condo to sell you in North Dakota. Hmmmm loudmouth Lavars kid who gets ESPN press 24/7 or Anthony Edwards.   Like I said enjoy it now.
I thought melo missed too many games? And Anthony edwards was beasting!  I guess lemelo making the play-in game and the Timberwolves being out of playoff contention since January played a role
&gt;Anthony Edwards ~~got fucking robbed~~ played shitty for half a season.  FTFY.
Anthony Edwards got fucking robbed.
Or maybe Anthony Edwards was terrible pre all star break and it matters if you were a massive liability half the year. Definitely no way there’s a logical explanation here...
Lamelo may have won but i think Anthony Edwards will quickly become a fan favorite in Seattle
"Anthony Edwards deserved it more, LaMelo played significantly less games and Ant was better in the second half of the season."
Anthony Edwards in shambles
Anthony Edwards in shambles
"He was never even close to that level or on that trajectory. Luka Doncic and Anthony Edwards are the guys most likely to dominate the league like Lebron imo.   Guys like Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, Andrew Wiggins, and Giannis are not that."
Hold the spot a few years for Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards
we need Jaylen Brown and Anthony Edwards and Steven Adams or something.
"Nah, the Anthony Edwards dunk was better. Recency bias definitely a thing here.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iODDxjp936A"
That’s the best poster I’ve seen since Anthony Edwards over Watanabe
"For what it's worth I voted Anthony Edwards, but they refused it since I'm not one of the voters."
I still remember people overhyping Cam Reddish because of that one interview with Anthony Edwards and a bunch of other players about Cam in AAU ball. Has he even played this series?
"I personally think Anthony Edwards had the better season, regardless of injury but I guess narrative is Lamelo"
Anthony Edwards is the road going forward. If the team doesn’t make steps next season then we’ll probably see a chance at blowing it up. If we keep the pick this year we’ve got a very interesting situation.
"can we stop with applying the same nickname to multiple players, ant is anthony edwards on the timberwolves, if you’re referring to anfernee simons there isn’t even a T in his first name lol"
"Royce O'Neale, Anthony Edwards, Jaren Jackson Jr"
"Dude has the same amount of experience as Anthony Edwards since high school, relax"
It wouldve been the craziest play in a while. Maybe since anthony edwards murdering watanabe
"Karl-Anthony Towns- 1st Overall   Anthony Edwards- 1st Overall  D’Angelo Russell- 2nd Overall   Ricky Rubio- 5th overall   I wonder which team had the most 1st overall picks, probably Showtime Lakers or a LeBron team"
ANTHONY EDWARDS
Anthony Edwards will turn out to be a glorified Wiggins. Even the rookie numbers are similar
"Anthony Edwards, in general"
Anthony edwards is already top 10
*Insert Anthony Edwards interview*
Anthony Edwards (Ego) Joe Ingles (Aussie Dad) Stephen Adams (NZ/Teddy Bear) Giannis Antetokounmpo (Sincerity) Donovan Mitchell (Smile)
"MPJ isn't dumb he's just extremely inexperienced but presented as an experienced player. He didn't play at all in college then missed like 2 years, played only part of the season last year then part of this shortened season (missed 10 games), when Anthony Edwards makes these mistakes nobody says it's because he's dumb despite him having about the same amount of game experience since high school as porter"
"&gt;What does Anthony Edwards have to do with this? Or AAU? Your ignorance is truly stupefying.   Because I said that most NBA players who make it to the NBA make it due to their athleticism. AAU is the organization that develops young players and doesn't put an emphasis on teaching them the tactical side of basketball or them working on their fundementals.  I mentioned Anthony Edwards as an example of that. But you also have Zion who was seen as an athletic freak and was drafted mostly because of that.  Look at the past 10 drafts, look at why most players were drafted and why most players flamed out. you'll see that most were athletic freaks who failed to develop any skill and were deemed replacable by the NBA. Those types of players don't make for good coaches.   But again keep on insulting me and assuming I'm a moron."
What does Anthony Edwards have to do with this?  Or AAU? Your ignorance is truly stupefying.
Anthony Edwards was literally drafted because he was an athletic freak not because of his BIQ and fundementals.  But keep on being offended by everything and calling everybody a racist.
Anthony Edwards. Hella adorable
"Might be a homer take, but I don’t see any hate toward Anthony Edwards. Kid’s just lovable."
Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards
"Anthony Edwards. He is an elite ping pong, lacrosse, tennis, rhythmic gymnastics, ultimate frisbee, golf player. He also would’ve been pro in baseball at pitcher, 3rd base, shortstop, center field. Also hit 4th or 5th in the order, clean up aisle 3. Trash can ball. Cook food.  [here’s my proof](https://youtu.be/SuWgunZng9Y)"
Anthony Edwards and LaMelo are back in their markets. So maybe soon?
So I've said a bunch this year that Anthony Edwards real comp is Mitchell and I've never hoped that is true more than this moment
Anthony Edwards has entered the chat.
"Almost no rookies would have gotten big playing time on this good of a team. Even Anthony Edwards wouldn’t have played a ton because of his defensive lapses. Also there was no offseason, there were very few practices this season, and he got covid"
"A ) i think youre overstating the development that happens in college.  Anthony edwards played 32 college games just chucking up shots on a shit team.  Its not like that did much of anything to set him up for NBA success  B ) by your logic that would make him a borderline college player, which might be more accurate.  But playing half an nba season is pretty significant in terms of a developmental opportunity  Also Wiseman had like a year of dedicated pro level  training before coming to the nba.  Its not really the same as graduating HS then coming to the league right after"
"1 - Luka  2 - Donovan (Biased, I know)  3 - Tatum  4 - Ja  5 - Trae  6 - Zion  7 - Ayton  8 - SGA  9 - Fox  10 - Bam  11 - MPJ  12 - Anthony Edwards  13 - Lamelo Ball  14 - Mikal Bridges  15 - Sexton"
Anthony Edwards has played one season lol Zion is better for now
Gimme playoff Anthony Edwards soundbites
"We keep:  * KAT * Anthony Edwards * DLo * Jaden McDaniels * Malik Beasley * Naz Reid * Rubio * Juancho  Honestly, any 2 of Rubio, Juancho, Vando, and Okogie can be kept, I just chose these 2 out of price."
"Honestly considering Kats a top 15-20 player, DLo when healthy is a boarder line all star, especially in the east, and Anthony Edwards looks like he could be a legit 22+ ppg scoring threat in the future and a future all star. That’s not a bad core and in the East I think thats in the 5-7 best team after the top 3 teams and then Atlanta."
"Nothing.   If you think that Ben Simmons is worth Anthony edwards and 2 firsts, you might be on something though."
[27/5.5/4.8 on 65.4% TS in May](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=anthony+edwards+ts%25+in+may)  [21.6/5.1/3.3 on 55.4% TS in April](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=anthony+edwards+ts%25+in+april)  he was creeping up month by month to that all star level.
"Depends on how good klay comes back as, he might not be 100% of the player he was pre-injury and also the warriors just weren't that great this season  Twolves are hungry for playoff appearances and anthony edwards looked really good  And with the pelicans, zion can probably carry them close if not all the way"
"Anthony Edwards is most deserving IMO because of his development throughout the year into all-star level production. Lamelo is excellent and a superstar passer, but Ant played all year and was solid as hell.   I think Lamelo will probably get it though because of media attention"
Huh? Yea Anthony Edwards
Anybody and Anthony Edwards
or maybe because basketball players arnt known for intelligence didt you see the vid of that girl exposed anthony edwards for cheating on his alg 2 hw? alg2 as a college freshman and he’s cheating
Anthony Edwards 😍
Wrong. Anthony Edwards deserved it and your dumbass knows it.
Anthony Edwards has never heard of this bet.
"While Kenny “the jet” Smith is a great analyst, I don’t think many consider him in the goat conversation.   Reggie Jackson was pretty solid with the pistons and while he would be the goat high school player in many states, he isn’t sniffing this conversation.   Jason Williams is the goat for nasty street all stuff and I’m glad you included him.   Anthony Davis is the goat of street clothes, not basketball.   Anthony Edwards, while being a top pick, hasn’t shown enough yet to be considered a goat.   And lastly, Benjamin Franklin? You actually may be right about that one. Dude deserves to be on Mount Rushmore."
Id trade anthony edwards for this kid.  My goodness he is good
I'd expect it to be at least somewhat entertaining if the dude had a fun personality. Like imagine it was Anthony Edwards on the date no way in hell it would be that boring.
"&gt; Why's everyone calling last year's bubble playoffs a fraud  Because the Lakers/Lebron won.  Folks will lie to themselves but if the Clippers had beaten the Lakers and won the title last year folks would be putting it as a stain on Lebron's legacy.  As Anthony Edwards said, I've never seen more people happy to see a guy fail."
"I agree with him being more valuable, he's actually close to the top on my lists of players I'd want playing for my team. I just think that when it comes to situations like this, you should ask yourself whats more likely. The timberwolves fixing their roster issues within the next two years, or them accepting that it's not their time now.  Because in two years edwards will have grown into his own, and if you make some extra trades on the not so nice commodities you'd be getting from the lakers you would've added two additional first round talents every years for the next three years. So you could have anthony edwards nearing his prime, a 29 year old jusuf nurkíc, and 6 additional 1sts round talents or another star if your team chooses to trade the picks.  So no, I wouldn't want my franchise to trade him either, but at the same time if later on they decide to do it, THIS is the deal they'll wish they would've taken."
Anthony Edwards would be a bust. I’m actually pretty glad I was wrong about that dude is a beast and a fun player to watch play
i've seen it a lot. but i'm older than Anthony Edwards
The last 3 NBA drafts has given so much fun players to the league. I 100% agree on the Anthony Edwards take. The guy is a tank. I'm also excited to see how Lamelo's scoring and defensive abilities blossom over the years.  edit - Love your take #2
"It’s weird to think I started watching almost 15 years ago now lol   1. Lebron or Kobe  2. Wade, Chris Paul, Carmelo (banana boat crew), Dwight Howard, Dirk  3. Underappreciated in hindsight is probably Dwight howard and overlooked is probably Chris bosh, especially after he joined the big 3. Bosh was kind of born too early as he would be the perfect big in today’s NBA.  4. Giannis, Luka, Embiid (if he can stay healthy)  5. Luka, Zion. My hottest take is probably that Anthony edwards has the potential to be in this group with his otherworldly athleticism"
Try to get anthony edwards from the wolves
I think KAT stays put because anthony edwards started to buy in later in the season so there are things to look forward too. I think the mavericks try to move KP for Beal since the heat just got oladipo.
"Anthony Edwards has the star power and his game has the potential , he will have to mature though."
Anthony Edwards?  That’s the dude with the unibrow who came from New Orleans right?
Maybe Anthony Edwards seen some shit on r/NBA and decided to post that.
I’ll admit I was hating and predicting a bust from his pre draft comments but man he turned that around quick and now I’m all in on the Anthony edwards hype
Anthony edwards is too young to even know why we hate bron. Young fella needs to quiet down and let the OGs enjoy this
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)  The actor, Anthony Edwards? /s"
"[Charania] Anthony Edwards has been fined $50,000 for tampering due to his Instagram comments regarding LeBron James."
Who the fuck is Anthony Edwards?
Anthony edwards averaged 24ppg after the all star break as a 19 year old rookie. This is dumb as hell.
"Lebron, KD, Curry, Giannis, Booker, Jokic, Anthony Edwards, Embiid, Lillard, Harden or anyone u find coolio"
"Anthony Edwards.    You’ll have as much fun watching his interviews as you will his highlights.  I don’t think I’ve ever laughed more watching a player give interviews.  And he’s super athletic and still figuring it all out, it’s fun to watch."
Anthony Edwards because those post-game pressers are only gonna get better.
The Name Anthony Edwards is worse then Jimmy Butler.
"it says  &gt;Might be weirdly worded, but I would rather my team have the 2021 second overall pick than to have the 2020 first overall pick, **even with the knowledge we have on the players having played a year in the NBA.** If I were a GM and i was offered any 2020 rookie or a chance to draft Green/Mobley, I would take the latter. Maybe i’m dumb, but Jalen Green is more enticing than Lamelo or Anthony Edwards in my eyes. What do you guys think ?"
What does Wiseman have anything to do with Anthony Edwards?
Anthony Edwards was better post all star. Much better.
"I don't think that's a fair assessment- he was pretty solid in Phoenix as I had described sans shooting and in this hypothetical Heat scenario, they wouldn't need him to produce as much offensively as they tried to get from him in Phx. The reason I like him over Lowry in Miami is just that he's got more years ahead of him and can become a core guy. Yes, his numbers weren't great this past year, but he was also on a garbage wolves squad and his one real job was teaching Anthony Edwards how to play basketball in crunchtime. Especially if UD and/or Iggy are gone next year, his presence would be a super positive externality on the Heats young guys"
"Offense: D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Anthony Edwards, Juancho Hernangomez, KAT.  Defense: Ricky Rubio, Jarrett Culver, Josh Okogie, Jaden McDaniels, Jarred Vanderbilt."
"Aside from the obvious 23…  0 gives you Lillard/DiVincenzo/Miles Bridges/Tatum/Love. D’lo is also there but that defence is already pretty rough so I’d have him off the bench to slaughter worse lineups with DiVincenzo starting.  00 could give you Lonnie Walker/Devin Booker/Anthony Edwards/Zion. Centre sucks, it’d be Mike Scott by default but Zion might actually be the best option there, but you’ve got guys like Malik Monk and TJ Warren and Bruce Brown to fill in the gaps."
"It's not just Laimbeer.  John Salley or James Edwards and those types.  Also trash like Anthony Mason on the Knicks and similar type of players on the Heat on Pat Riley and Van Gundy's teams.  Good riddance to that ""style"" of basketball."
Anthony edwards
Isn this the dude that was murdered by Anthony edwards?
Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards is in that tier of athlete IMO
&gt; A modern day comparison that’ll get me a lot of hate but Anthony Edwards  Edwards is literally one of the most athletic people in NBA history wtf
"Kobe is in that tier of “omg an amazing athlete” but not at the freak level of people like Shaq, Giannis, Lebron, Jordan, Lavine etc  A modern day comparison that’ll get me a lot of hate but Anthony Edwards"
"Pistons are championship contenders  Thunder trade picks for an All-Star   Jaylen Brown somehow leaves Boston  Anthony Edwards becomes a top 10 player   AD retired earlier than expected to injuries   Vegas has their own basketball club, and is one of the most successful franchises in the NBA  Chris Paul is a coach   James Wiseman is one of the best centers in the league   Matisse Thybulle is the best defender we've seen in years   Wizards have a core with Avdija, Hachimura, and Gafford   LeBron has a front office position   Cade Cunningham doesn't live up to his potential  THT is an All-Star"
Anthony Edwards MVP!!!!
Was planning on being nice and linking it. Got lazy. Just look up “Anthony Edwards Multi Athlete”
Anthony edwards dame straight uр? disregarding salaries of course.
—Me after Yuta got dunked on by Anthony Edwards
"Everything klay says on ig live gets posted  Everything lebron says is dissected  All of Giannis’ quotes are getting posted  Anthony edwards was a big one too, quotable guy  All i got"
Anthony Edwards ROTY for quotes.
Anthony Edwards is wayyyyy too high right now  Actually I got a lotta issues with this list lmao
"Philly gives up a billion picks, Simmons, Thybulle, and Maxey. Portland gives up Dame. Minnesota gives up some more picks and gets Simmons. Then some random stuff to make salary work. Minnesota is apparently very interested in Simmons. Depending on interest, maybe Portland can get back Anthony Edwards. Edwards, Thybulle, Maxey, CJ, and a billion picks."
"I'm quite confident that Giannis, Luka, and Jokic will be int he top 5. Because they're all mvp candidates right now, and have not hit their prime.  There is no one else I'm really confident about. Tatum was my first thought, but I can't say for certain, as making the leap from a top 10 player to a top 5 player is huge. Like I don't think Paul George was ever really considered a top 5 player. Bu he is defintely on eo f the guys I'm thinking of.  Zion definitely considering him.  Trae and Morant definitely them.  I don't think Cade would make it to the top 5 that quick.  Embiid could still be there if his health holds up.  I think despite their age, Curry, Harden, and KD could all still be in the top 5.  I don't think Anthony Davis will be a top 5 player.  I'm curious to see how Lamelo and Anthony Edwards do, but I don't think they'll quite make it there.  So if I had to pick the last 2 spots for the top 5, I would go with Zion and Trae, with Tatum being the runner up."
1. Luka Doncic 2. Anthony Edwards 3. Jayson Tatum 4. Zion Williamson 5. Paolo Banchero
Not seeing enough Anthony Edwards on these lists :)
"Keep sleeping on Anthony Edwards, the 19 year old who averaged 24 ppg on above average efficiency post ASB after no training camp. This was also a stretch where the Wolves played .500 ball, beating the Jazz in consecutive games and beating the Suns without D'Lo in a game where Ant dropped 42."

"Realistic options: Christian Wood or Myles Turner  Unrealistic: Anthony Edwards, DeAndre Ayton, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"
Anthony Edwards isn't all star level player yet
Anthony Edwards is so overrated he is worse than Lamelo and Haliburton. He is an empty calories chucker.
"If we’re doing current NBA players, Hawks would look something like:  - PG: Malcolm Brogdon/Sexton/Lou Will (if you count Sexton as a PG) - SG: Jaylen Brown/Anthony Edwards/Malik Beasley - SF: Devin Vassell/Okoro/Okeke - PF: Jae Crowder/Derrick Favors/Aminu? (We’re lacking at PF) - C: Wendell Carter Jr/Dwight Howard  I can’t think of a third center but honestly not bad at all.  Edit: I’m leaving r/Dwight in there, formatting be damned"
And that must make Anthony edwards Jesus fucking Christ cause he’s about to save our souls from eternal damnation
"If the right opportunity presented itself they would. Simmons for Dlo straight up? They pull the trigger on that all day. Also Anthony Edwards was an unknown asset when we got Dlo.           Also, I love KAT, he’s my favorite player. But if you’re making your teams decisions based off the opinion of a player who has only taken your team to the playoffs once you’re not making the right decisions. There’s only like 5 players in the league that I could handle making that impactful of a decision"
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"

No disrespect but I think randle falls off a little. His efficiency was a little too high this season and I cant see the knicks getting the 4th seed again unless the other teams have injury problems again. Wouldnt be surprised if he misses all nba.   Breakout I think is Anthony edwards. Wolves started winning some games once they got kat back and the team was a little healthy. During that time (post all star) ant was avg 24/5/4 and had the 3rd highest pull up 3% in the league along side steph and dame. I really think they could be in the playoff hunt and hes gonna be a huge reason for it.
"&gt; Where are the better deals for him this offseason? Serious question.  You're not going to find much better than a Wiseman/Ben Simmons type this season. Nobody is going to give up a prospect like SGA or Anthony Edwards, most of those teams would trade their key young guy for Dame and be in the same position: unable to contend. Everyone in this thread just hasn't thought long enough about who could realistically trade for Dame and what would make sense.  Like Jamal Murray, Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown etc. are your BEST case scenario players. Guy on their second contract making near Max or max money, on a team that has a realistic chance to compete if they trade for Dame."
"Is he in the tier with Dame and Luka like you had mentioned, no obviously not. Is he in the tier with Tatum and Mitchell, he might be, if he’s not he’s definitely closer than you make him out to be.  This wasn’t even the original point. The original point made was that Booker right now is not top 20 and he’s not good at defense, therefor he has no chance of ever being an MVP.  Anthony Edwards and Lamelo Ball are 19 years old. Both are not top 20 and are defensive liabilities, yet how can we rule them out from being MVP candidates one day?   I agree in saying we need to wait until they hit their prime to see if they can be MVP’s, but saying they have the *Potential* to get their one day isn’t illegal"
Anthony Edwards has a vet vibe at a young age.
That's a really fucking dumb justification. Most draft boards had Anthony Edwards first overall and were proven right. But we need to give credit to some idiot who had Hayes first and was proven to be incredibly wrong?
Trading Anthony Edwards for Chris Paul is one of the dumbest trade ideas I've seen on this sub lol
"I like both of them , For those who think second one can be better,   You are choosing Anthony Edwards over Kevin Durant.  Hope Ant makes the same leap in 2nd and 3rd seasons like Durantula"
Anthony Edwards is gonna break into a Top 25 player by the end of the year.
Anthony Edwards and Cam Reddish
"i'd personally take Bam above like 20 guys on this list. And there's 0 shot im taking Anthony Edwards, Lamelo, John Collins, D'angelo Russell, CJ McCollum over Bam."
yeah but the only young asset the Wolves have is Anthony Edwards
Lmao no they're not.  D Lo maybe.  But definitely 100% not Anthony Edwards. That kid is just too special on and off the court.
"&gt;I don’t think the Sixers would be interested in Ant, he doesn’t fit their timeline.  Bullshit. Ant is already almost the real deal. He can grow to be a force as early as the end of the coming season. The 6ers already have more than enough vets. Trading Simmons for Ant would be a move for now and for the future.  In 36 Post ASB games, he literally averaged 24ppg on 45/35/76 shooting. Anthony Edwards has a lot of room to improve, but the kid has arrived."
1 I love me some kat But I also love me some Anthony Edwards
Might be the most talented/skilled prospect != might be the number one pick. You can be a potential #1 pick without necessarily being a historically great draft prospect. An example of this is Anthony Edwards last year. He's good but was never Zion-level great/hyped.
"SGA is like 21 with a high ceiling. OKC isn’t trading him for Cade Cunningham, let alone Anthony Edwards."
Anthony Edwards did seem to develop well as the season went along
Listening to Lil Baby 🤢😬 Anthony Edwards confirmed not wavy.
"&gt;What do you think they're depth chart is right now? For me it would be: Towns/Reid Vanderbilt/Juancho/McDaniels Beasley/McDaniels/Culver Edwards/Russell/Beasley Rubio/Russell  * C: KAT/Naz/Vanderbilt  * PF: Vanderbilt/Jaden McDaniels  * SF: Jaden McDaniels/ Okogie / Culver  * SG: Anthony Edwards / Beasley / Nowell  * PG: D'Lo / Rubio / Bolmaro  As the roster is now probably this.   &gt;I'd be pretty keen to either get off Russell (more than Beasley or Rubio), but I'm not sure he's destined to be a starter in Minnesota  Won't happen because of KAT and the optics of trading him now."
"I understand your point and agree to an extent but I'm trying to say injuries happen at different levels of activity and you can't just say if you do a low level of intensity on your physical activity you won't get injured. Anthony Edwards played in a practice session, which I would compare to an off-season workout, and he tweaked his ankle."
"Having Lillard, Harden, Embiid and Jokic in the same tier as Anthony Edwards is a joke"
"UGA alum and football fan that used to go to basketball games:  We haven’t won a tournament game in 20 years. The most successful season I can remember since going to school there was a close loss in the opening round to fucking Washington when Travis Leslie and Trey Thompkins were on the team and both ended up on the Clippers and out of the league in two years.   Give us something to cheer about and we’ll be there. Anthony Edwards was nice last year, but a 14-12 record just isn’t enough for sustained enthusiasm from a fan base. I’d love to have a basketball team worth cheering for, but we’ve been absolute trash for decades relative to the talent we should be able to sign out of Georgia."
"In the last 13 years, since 2007, five guards - Anthony Edwards, Markelle Fultz (yikes), Kyrie Irving, John Wall, and Derrick Rose - have been taken #1.      Only Fultz was a mistake IMO."
"Anthony Edwards is (hopefully) a long way away from retiring, but he’s already given some iconic quotes and has a great personality. I think he’d do well."
Anthony edwards hands down just need to wait 15 years
"This is likely due to the fact that Anthony Edwards credits Rubio as the biggest positive impact on the progress he made during his rookie year. That has to mean something for a team that frankly doesn't have much experience with winning on their roster and has seen multiple prospects not work out, likely because of their inability to develop young players. Plus they have a first-time head coach. I know Rubio's really only been on one playoff team but who else on that roster would you want to teach Edwards about how much work it takes to get better in the NBA?"
Anthony Edwards. Dude has the game and personality to be the face of the league if he can deliver on the court.
"Anthony Edwards. Dude is gonna be an all star next year, and a superstar in 3-4"
What ANT are you referring to? I’m referring to twolves rookie Anthony Edwards.
Zion Williamson - 28/10 on 62/30/72 shooting  DeAndre Hunter - 15/4 on 45/35/85  RJ Barrett - 18/6/4 on 45/37/77  Ja Morant - 21/4/8 on 43/32/74  Mikal Bridges - 13/5 on 50/40/85  Cam Reddish - 10/5 on 38/31/80  Kevin Porter Jr. - 18/3/7 on 41/30/76  Anthony Edwards - 22/4/4 on 43/35/80  LaMelo Ball - 16/7/8 on 44/37/78  James Wiseman - 14/9 on 55/33/70  Patrick Williams - 11/6 on 46/37/72  Onyeka Okongwu - 7/7 on 60/-/60  Tyrese Halliburton - 14/4/6 on 45/40/85  Killian Hayes - 11/3/6 on 37/34/80
Two words: Anthony Edwards
"Anthony Edwards has all the tools to be one of the absolute best players in the league.  I know that doesn't necessarily represent a ""Curry-Like"" leap, but I'm excited to watch his career pan out."
"Definitely the Timberwolves in my opinion. Not only did they forfeit their top 10 pick this year, I see a likely scenario where KAT wants out and the Timberwolves (who are already one of the worst teams in the league) lose their best player and are stuck with D'Angelo Russell. They always have the bright spot of Anthony Edwards though."
Anthony Edwards will be a legit superstar soon. He has the whole package. He’s that guy pal.
I mean positive record in 25 games when the team was (mostly) healthy and a 19 year old Anthony Edwards on any team makes the future alright
"They're really dependent on Anthony Edwards being THAT guy, because we've seen what a team led by KAT can do and it's not competitive in the West.  Edwards had a great rookie season, but the playoff race is just so stacked."
Anthony Edwards would have been amazing on the Hawks personality wise
"Timberwolves, they're going to need to inevitably face the music and trade KAT and build around Anthony Edwards"
Anthony Edwards
"&gt; Towns has Russel, Wiggens, Anthony Edwards. An actual All Star on his team, multiple top picks.  Rudy Gay and Wiggins were comparable players basically but you really just named wiggins like he was great help  You ignore the Timberwolves played a lot of games without KAT and D'lo on the roster this year too so bringing up ""he has D'lo and Edwards"" is a wash  Also some of these ""top picks"" were either not good or got traded away from the team but this argument could be said for boogie (its a stupid argument either way)"
"the ones I'm seeing (ant, wiseman, lamelo) actually are club options in years 3 and 4, then RFA year 5.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/minnesota-timberwolves/anthony-edwards-70643/"
Nice to see players replicate their game after Anthony Edwards.
Yes man lol scouts even said he might (we all know Zion is Zion) but some say he had the higher potential of the 3. There’s even the video of Anthony Edwards saying “he gave you 40?” Back in high school lol reddish was ranked like top 5 His shot just wouldn’t drop in college   My bad for the essay
"Zach Lavine, LBJ and Anthony Edwards, just how high they jump. It is unbelievable. I would have put Ja too but most of the time he misses of them."
"100% bias here, Anthony Edwards"
Dame  Anthony Edwards  Vucevic
anthony edwards will go down as one of the best [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jpxdQ0cWYg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jpxdQ0cWYg)  shannon brown is one of the best https://youtu.be/sjFfwrOdZV0
All-time: VC.   Recent History: Lebron  Currently: either Miles Bridges or Anthony Edwards
"I don't know what plotline it would work for, but Anthony Edwards is hilarious in any context."
lol Anthony Edwards took over.
Anthony Edwards with a valiant effort but Fultz was too much
"So you’re saying they could’ve had Luka, Zion and Anthony Edwards eh"
"i think those guys, except zion (assuming he stays healthy) are a clear tier below the others lol. Anthony edwards had a good second half of the season. Lamello won ROTY but that is so far from putting somone in “top 10 ever“ conversations lol. Its an award that often doesnt even go to the best rookie from that year (when you look back on who won it i mean, not in the individual season)"
"Anthony Edwards, Lamelo ball, Zion. these guys have a chance at it."
"IT on the Kings was a lot different than IT on the Celtics. And you are trying to say Rudy Gay was a great player on the Kings?  Towns has Russel, Wiggens, Anthony Edwards. An actual All Star on his team, multiple top picks."
literally went up and told them to get the fuck away from his property while hitting the windows of their car with a loaded assault rifle. it was a random couple with their child in the back seat of the car who happened to be looking at houses in the neighborhood. he stood in the middle of the street and continued to aim the gun at the car with his eye in the scope until they drove off and fully disappeared from sight. but no one gives a shit bc anthony edwards made the wolves sp0oky again lol
Anthony Edwards is the best player on the planet
"Yeah for sure. For what it’s worth, I think the Wolves could be a sleeper playoff team in the West if Anthony Edwards builds on his performance in the second half of the year."
Anthony Edwards sounds like the name of an actor that was on a popular NBC medical drama from the ‘90s.
Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards can get up there
"I watch the Hawks when I get the chance as well as some other primetime games that come up on the major networks.  And I was saying that there is a probability that Sacramento is equal than or greater than the Wolves, which is very true.  I am well aware of the Minnesota injury report throughout the year. It sucks. But they aren't the only team that had their season derailed by injuries and the condensed season. That said, per [mangameslost.com](https://mangameslost.com), Minnesota was the 6th healthiest team and was the worst performing team in the league in correlation with health to wins earned. They were simply put, the worst team in the league in this regard. And with Anthony Edwards improving his game and Minnesota also having the worse coach at the start of the year, I have no argument with that. Those are facts.  But Sacramento of course has Luke Walton. One of the worst in the organization. The Kings were also the 9th most injured team in the league. A healthier Kings squad would have won 6 more games and finished 37-35, good for a play-in spot. Minnesota on the other hand, was projected to finish with 5 more wins if they were healthy and finished the year 28-44. All of this you can find on [mangameslost.com](https://mangameslost.com) if you are subscribed.  I for one believe to have low expectations for teams that are always stuck in mediocrity unless something drastic happens within the organization, like the acquisition of an All-NBA calibre player, or a head coaching change. Then everything in regards to predictions is up in the air. Those things didn't happen for Minnesota.  Anyways, I stand by my prediction. Sacramento will be just as good if not better than Minnesota."
I honestly think if he had a less boring name he’d be way more hyped. Anthony Edwards sounds like a personal injury attorney who puts ads on the sides of buses.
If you genuinely think Sacramento is as good as the Twolves roster you’re delusional and don’t watch any basketball. Our team played 9 games together last season. We started with the worst coach in the NBA. Anthony Edwards drastically improved his game in the second half of the season. I see the Wolves as right around the 8/9 seed with a strong possibility of making the play in at least.
Anthony Edwards or Naz Reid only right answers.
Played AAU/high school ball with Devin Vassell and Anthony Edwards. Met Chris Paul when i was 10. Teammates with Josh Okogie in high school. Played against Marvin Bagley in the 8th grade and plenty of other future NBA players.  Here I am Chegging my way to a bachelors degree
Anthony Edwards will break rose's mvp record.  A1 Since day 1.
Anthony Edwards is about to average 27-28 this season.
"Honestly once KG was traded and I went off to college and didn’t come back to watching basketball and the Wolves until this past year when they drafted Anthony Edwards. So I’m not an expert on what happened afterwards. But seems like mainly they had bad luck / whiffed on their lottery selections way too much, and being in the smaller market in MN they never sign any big free agents. So when your draft picks don’t elevate the team, there isn’t much else happening. Seems like there was a lot of varying methodologies being employed too, and different coaches. The past 6 years getting KAT and Anthony Edwards give them a chance. Anthony Edwards could very well decide the fate of the team and how far they can go in the coming years. Their current situation is better now than ever since KG was traded imo."
I feel like Anthony Edwards will be on that top 10 list soon
Anthony Edwards will be a Top 5 Player and arguable face of the league at some point in his career
Pretty sure Anthony Edwards is 6'4 and he's got some crazy dunks.
Legit the only user on r/NBA that I can remember is the dude with the Anthony Edwards profile pic cuz I always see him hating on butler whenever he comes up. Shits weird af lmao
he has dlo and malik beasly and even to some extent anthony edwards.  you see other bigman lead their teams to better seasons with worse rosters. J randle and the knicks for example that roster has to be less talented than the Twolves the second best player is rj barett lol.
"Its weird you're getting downvoted this much.  Don't people always derisively say the regular season doesn't matter, and wished it mattered more?  Giving a wider breadth of teams a spotlight is how you get more people to care about the regular season and care more about the other teams.  Extreme short term scheduling like this harms the league as a whole.  Any business would do better to plan out further than the next year, or the next quarter.  Guys like Lebron, Steph, KD already have massive fanbases that will follow them and watch them and buy their stuff no matter what city they are at.  They're set.  Its the guys like Cade who needs to prove he's the #1 seed, or Jalen Green to show other teams made a mistake in thinking he's #2, Anthony Edwards who needs to be given a chance to play for a national audience, Lamelo who should be allowed to capitalize on his social media fanbase, Siakam who was touted as one of the next crop of superstars when they won the championship.    The league is looking at a massive hole in interest like the years right after MJ left when each of the top guys start retiring in the next 5 or so years.  Building up younger players now is a way to prevent that drop from being so steep.  Fuck the casuals, they are casuals who are interested in watching only Lebron and Steph *because* the NBA treats them like casuals.  Give them a dose of Lamelo and his passing, show them Ja Morant flying through the air, have them watch Lavine dunk on guys all night.  It may not take immediately, but that's how you turn casuals into fans, because there's a lot of people living in the midwest or in cities like Cinncinati or Topeka or Vegas who may only be able to watch the national games, and we've had a decade of Lebron ruling the airwaves.  If they're not fans already, then feeding them more of the same isn't going to get them interested."
Fr man. I'm high on Anthony Edwards. He good.
"Jesus what a horrible list.   1.lebron James  2. Dwight Howard   3. Yao Ming  4. Derrick rose  5. Anthony Davis  6. Kyrie Irving  7. John wall  8. Blake Griffin  9. Deandre Ayton   10. KAT or Zion   I suspect both edwards, Zion and Austin to be much higher on this list in a few years."
A low usage guard who plays defense and shoots threes is more valuable when you have Ben Simmons and Anthony Edwards handling things on offense.
Not marketing Anthony Edwards feels dumb
"My revised group is Anthony Edwards speed, handles, strength, and vertical. Combined with KATs frame, shooting, passing, and post moves.  It’s not like superstars but it’s pretty much KAT with way more strength, ability to attack the rim, and athleticism. I think this kind of player would put up like 33, 14, 6 on splits of 53/42/85."
"L.A.'s unprotected first-round picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026, along with 2021 (unprotected) and 2023 (protected).   LA traded 5 picks all the way out to 2026 and only 2023 had ANY protections.   Blazers would be getting picks later then 2024 and with NO protections from Philly. May be the picks from Minnesota as sweetener can have light protections.     But also the your trade isn't even possible. The Blazers can't take back 5 players...honestly none of which are even worth taking in the first place. Only player in a 3 team deal I'd be interested in is Anthony Edwards and then you can take out any picks from Minnesota."
Anthony Edwards dunking resembles MJ. Dru Holidays defense might be a low budget MJ.
"That doesn’t make any sense lol. Lots of really good players play in college and can’t elevate bad teams. Tons of guys come into the NBA and are immediately top 100 players from their rookie year, yet just 6 months ago they were struggling to make the tourney in college. Anthony Edwards is a CURRENT example."
"Kawhi isn’t the athlete that young Jordan was but he plays like second three peat Jordan just slower, first three peat maybe Anthony Edwards  Devin Booker kinda plays like Kobe and Kobe was an MJ reskin just a little worse so maybe him as well"
"Structure is probably something where they hope Washington/Portland want to rebuild, then offer any young player from Minnesota not named Anthony Edwards and picks from Philly + Minnesota for Beal/Lillard.   If Minnesota has a Russell/Edwards/Simmons/KAT core, they probably don't care about picks too much, and both teams can combine to offer more picks than any non-OKC team could, if Portland/Washington want to rebuild."
"Feel like it would take Anthony Edwards + 1 FRP. Simmons/Dlo/KAT is still really strong.   If you’re really high on Edwards it may have to be DLo. Basically it will have to be one of them because there’s no way Bev and trash gets it done, you have to sacrifice something of worth lol"
Terrible comp. It's like comparing Anthony Edwards to Lebron because they're both athletic.

Anthony Edwards: Interviewing  KD: Twitter  Klay: Boating  Simmons: Social Gatherings
"Idk Lavine, Ja Morant, Bam, LaMelo, Anthony Edwards, Brandon Ingram, Jaylen Brown, Mitchell, Jamal Murray, SGA, KAT,"
lol  Anthony Davis  Anthony Edwards  Tony Allen
You know Anthony Edwards and Rubio were best buds on our team.  Why settle for Big Honey when you can get double trouble?
The only thing in this world that can stop Anthony Edwards is the Timberwolves organisation lmao
only person that can stop anthony edwards is anthony edwards
Except for Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels.
"Yeah and he’s been comically wrong far more often than he’s been right. The worst part is that he’s so hard headed and uses stats in such a clearly biased manor. People remember him for hyping up Jokic and think he’s some prophet, but this is the same guy who also said that Jeremy Lin would be an MVP contender under Mike D’Antoni, Lamelo Bell and Anthony Edwards were clear busts while Wiseman and Poku will be stars, and so on."
This just isnt true. Lamelo returned from injury and played his worst stretch which was 10 games and he averaged. 15.1pts 6.2rebs 6.2ast 1.6stl 0.4blks and 3to's on .384 from the field and .244 from 3.  Anthony edwards worst 10 game stretch was 11.3pts 3.3rebs 1.6ast 0.7stls 0blks and 1.9to's on .310 from the field and .340 from 3.  He was way less productive in his worst stretch b/c he didn't rebound or playmake while he was shooting terribly from the field.
"Up for debate, but it is still NBA basketball. If we choose to collectively ignore garbage time that would change a lot of stats too. It's something I've thought about after seeing [Anthony Edwards](https://stats.inpredictable.com/nba/ssnPlayerClutch.php?pid=1630162) shooting stats. You can see he was significantly better at shooting in garbage time versus other situations.   His eFG for the season was 48.8%  Ignoring garbage time it becomes 47.4%  Which is more accurate? I'm not taking a position, just saying we regularly report numbers with garbage time included."
"Obviously you have those kinds of aspirations for KAT and DLo but the real X factor on the team is Anthony Edwards. His ceiling is the team’s ceiling, and if he maximizes his potential it’s crazy to think about how wild that offense could be."
"Anthony Edwards is the truth. He’s the deciding factor, and I think he’s gonna surprise a lot of people next year by playing at an all star level (at least on offense...defense I hope he just becomes passable)"
"Porzingis, THJ, Josh Richardson is better than Dlo, Beasley, Anthony Edwards? Damn, gimme a turn of whatever you're smoking."
Going to repost a dive into the numbers I took last season.   Anthony Edwards had a historically good scoring season for a 19 year old. The folks he compared to mostly turned out to be great so he’s hopefully on his way.   Post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nfliv8/anthony_edwards_and_his_historic_scoring_season/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
"I'm Dominican  I want Kat to win, I know DLO is nice, and I know Anthony Edwards is a monster ...  But you have to win more than like 25 games before u say anything abt being as good or Booker or Nikola"
2021 Finals would have been  Lakers:  PG: Ja Morant  SG: Anthony Edwards  SF: LeBron James  PF: Anthony Davis  C: DeAndre Ayton  vs  Knicks:  PG: Trae Young  SG: Luka Doncic  SF: Ben Simmons  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Karl Anthony Towns
"I could have phrased that better. My main point is that neither of them are all that special as scorers relative to the league. FVV is a better scorer than Smart but he isn’t a good scorer. By saying it’s not so large a gap, I mean that FVV isn’t far enough ahead of Smart as a scorer for his scoring to move the needle much.  If FVV had slightly below average efficiency, it would be one thing. But it’s bad enough, and has historically been bad enough except for brief periods of time, that his value as a volume scorer is pretty low because there are tons of players on at least as high volume who are actually efficient. When a player has such low efficiency, you want other players to be taking those shots and the player in question to bring value in other ways.  FVV’s never had a season with above league average ts%, not even the years he averaged 2.9, 8.6, and 11 ppg. He averaged 19.6 ppg this year. Of 53 players who averaged at least 19 ppg last year, only Westbrook, Anthony Edwards, John Wall, and Caris LeVert were as inefficient. So if a team is looking for a scorer, there’s at least 49 players out there who would be a better fit for the role and way more than that if you lower the ppg requirement just a point or 2."
Looks more effortless. Anthony Edwards looks like he’s catapulting it out there.
"KAT, DLo, and Anthony Edwards:  We're just 3 cool guys looking for another cool guy to hang at our party mansion... nothing sexual"
Curry  Anthony edwards  Bird  Duncan  Hakeem
"Anthony edwards with the youngest mvp (only player i am okay with taking rose record).   Aftrr drafting mamu, giannis is moved to bench and wins 6MOTY becoming first player with every individual award"
"Sixers get: Anthony Edwards, Kat, DLo, 1st round pick, Michael Porter JR.         Nuggets get: Danny Green.         Twolves get: Ben Simmons.            All teams say yes."
"The only way I could see a trade working out is:  ####Minnesota:  Ben Simmons  Quality depth from young team  Depth from PHI   ####76ers:  High-level starter from young team  High-level starter from young team  2x Minnesota 1st round pick  Young team 2nd round pick  ####Young Team:  Anthony Edwards  Filler  Filler  ---------  I know everyone's gonna say Minnesota would never trade Edwards, and that's fine, I just mean that's the only feasible way I could see this trade coming together.   Minnesota isn't going to want to gut their team to add Simmons, and Edwards is the only piece valuable enough for them to get a trade going without gutting it. Philly isn't going to want Edwards because the timelines between him and Embiid are too rough. Embiid might be cooked by time Edwards hits his prime.   Find a young team willing to gut themselves to take on Edwards, and that's the best chance of getting the trade done."
"The argument about the franchise being shitty and it affecting development of young players usually comes from people who know nothing about Timberwolves. Yes, we are perennial suckers and yes, we frequently draft busts in the lottery. However, with the new management (since 2019) we have drafted (or signed as undrafted FA) and played Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, and Jarrett Culver. [We also drafted Bolmaro but we are yet to see his development in the team]. ALL of them have shown a development to some extend and all of them are way better players/assets than Culver.   Culver was given all the chances in the world. We even started him at PG during the rookie season. He was below average in his first season, however with some promise. He worked hard over the summer and came to the training camp in a decent shape, impressed the fans during the preseason games. He started last season as 6-7 man in the rotation. The team started to suck right away after KAT got injured, and Culver even started for some games. He has shown NOTHING. He cannot shoot, cannot be a playmaker, cannot finish with contact. His defense is mediocre at best, Okogie is a way better defender than him.   Culver reminds me of a poor man version of Josh Hart who has a similar skillset but does everything worse. I feel like Josh Hart is his ceiling if he really works hard and figures it out. At this point, Im very glad Timberwolves dont have to make a decision about picking up his option for the next year - paying 14+ mil to Culver in the next 2 years could have been a problem. I hopes he at least can play in the summer league, but he got injured at the end of the last season and did not recover. Wish him all the best, but not in Timberwolves uniform."
You can't win with logic here. You're the bad man for coming at a franchise for pacifying their weak azz stars. (Yeah KAT is as good as Andre Drummond fluff stats on poor teams). I would've traded Kat to the Knicks for both of the firsts this year and they keep Jonathan Kuminga (hope I spell it right) plus them picks u got a deep young team. But now they got two former all stars mentoring Anthony Edwards on how to fall off.
Anthony Edwards is taking the mantle from Lebron as the next face of the NBA
Anthony Edwards easy
"Looking like Lamelo Ball or Anthony Edwards at the moment but if I’m have to pick one then it’s Lamelo as he looks like he has the whole package: handle, passing, playmaking, size, improving shot. control of the offense."
"Anthony Edwards, he has superstar written all over him, I’m also biased too but I really he has the it all, just needs to put it together"
"MPJ, Ayton, Ja Morant, Anthony Edwards, SGA"
"Actually an interesting question, I would say Ingram but he is 23, so I guess he doesn't count. Then I would've picked Fox, but he's also 23, so doesn't count. Then I would've picked SGA, but he's 23.  So I'll say Ja, then probably LaMelo, then Anthony Edwards."
Anthony Edwards and Jalen Green.
Anthony Edwards will be the next best player in the NBA. Just give the kid 5 years.
Who cares? Anthony edwards is fuckin awesome time to move on
"A few factors, really.   He had some concerns (mainly weight, athleticism, and attitude) that pushed him down boards a bit (plenty of skilled by poorly conditioned bigs have washed out of the league). On top of that, he’s a center, which means he’s already at a positional disadvantage when it comes to draft position. And finally, once he did start slipping, I believe his agent specifically angled to have him go undrafted rather than be picked late so he could pick his team: he had an agreement in place with the Wolves essentially the second the draft ended.   Too, he’s done an awesome job of putting in the work to improve. He’s apparently lost 30 pounds and went from a pretty plodding big to one who’s super nimble and throwing down more dunks than Anthony Edwards. His success today wasn’t guaranteed when he was drafted."
Anthony Edwards says stay in school
Idk anthony edwards seems pretty edwards to me
He’s going to teach Anthony Edwards how to be a dawg
If you mean Anthony Edwards not a chance in hell we’d even do it straight up for Simmons. If you mean Edward Anthony then a deal can be arranged for that.
"&gt;Philadelphia gets:  &gt;Anthony Edwards &gt;Malik Beasley &gt;Jaden McDaniels  This has to be trolling, right? Nobody is this dumb."
"Listen, teams have to show star players they care about what they want and the Timberwolves have given KAT two years with his best bud when they could have gone a different direction.  If anyone gets traded though it would be D’Lo, he only has 1 more year under contract after this season anyway. Imagine if the Rockets traded Jalen Green or the Cavs Evan Mobley for *Ben Simmons*, that’s what losing Anthony Edwards amounts to."
"Simmons + KAT is actually a pretty good combo, but they can’t get him without giving away Anthony Edwards, which would suck massively"
An Anthony Edwards interview if Ant was dropped on his head seconds before the interview
It’s like a less funny Anthony Edwards interview
I agree I think KAT is the perfect #2 and I think Anthony Edwards is fit to be a #1 with his athletic ability and outrageous confidence.
"Who’s Ants? Like Anthony Edwards? The 20 year old? There’s separate cultures as well. There’s locker room culture, which KAT and Ant excel at, and there is culture on the court, which Ant is good at and Pat Bev is good at.   The Suns brought in Chris Paul to change the culture and I don’t see D Book catching flack."
"Jalen, isn't Black like that...He is Black but grew up on a city thats 8% Black.  His mom is Filipino.  Did he go to a Black church? Black Barbershop?  Jalen isn't a 'city kid'.  Nothing is wrong with that.  But most guys who are city guys dont mind Detroit.  But if you are use to certain things. Its not for you.  Honestly, a 19 year old rookie worried about anything other than basketball is problematic. Anthony Edwards left ATL to go MSP and is happy to be there.  Two places that couldn't be more different, lol."
"assuming we're using last season rosters since our rookies haven't played yet, would I give up Jerami Grant and Josh Jackson for KAT and Anthony Edwards? Hell yeah I would."

Anthony Edwards and Morant are my picks
"That’s tough, I’m a big fan of KAT and ant but I’m just not sure I would take them over Anthony Edwards and Karl Anthony towns"
Jalen Green is the evil Anthony Edwards.
This is giving me the Anthony Edwards hate vibes precisely a year ago hahaaa the circle of reddit
"Most players do, you think Anthony edwards really wanted to play in Minnesota? Or did he want to be the first overall pick?"
"Okay Imma explain it to you Karl-Anthony Towns the all nba player in his prime is better than Roty runner up Anthony Edwards after his rookie season.  Now to the latter part, I am personally confused as to what you meant by ""works hard enough to be elite"". If its about his skills no worries cuz hes up there already and doesn't need to work very much anymore. If its about his will to win all I can give you is a lets agree to disagree."
Kyrie Irving / Ja Morant   Anthony Edwards  Brandon Ingram  Ben Simmons / Zion Williamson  Anthony Davis / Deandre Ayton    tbh seems like it's mostly big men and point guards ... not a lot of wings to choose from
Giannis Antetokoumpo - Lebron James  Anthony Edwards - Dwayne Wade   Jaren Jackson Jr - Chris Bosh  &amp;#x200B;  This is my ultra realistic comparison.
Anthony Edwards is gonna average 26 next season
Anthony edwards patrick williams jaden mcdaniels zion cade luka trae tatum  shai
Anthony Edwards
"luka doncic, jrue holiday, jaylen brown, brandon ingram, anthony edwards, deandre ayton, SGA"
if Anthony Edwards is better next year and they don't make the playoffs its honestly just KAT being part of the problem. hes not as bad defensively as people say he is but for his position and how good he is hes gotta be like really good at defense or really good at passing like Jokic lol.  if I'm the Wolves I'm highly considering trading him if next year its more of the same old.  just get a boat load for him before he loses all his value tbh
Michael Jordan is a hobo’s Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards is a better rapper so if he becomes a superstar I don’t think damn would even have that
Isiah Stewart &lt; Anthony Edwards
I don’t know what you’re talking about. Isaiah Stewert is easily 5x better than Anthony Edwards
I might get downvoted for this but I think Anthony Edwards is the best player in his class over Isaiah Stewart
All time:  1. KG 2. Steve Nash  Current: 1. Anthony Edwards 2. Steph Curry 3. Giannis
"By far my fav sports quote in the last couple years, besides the Edwards one: “I put in the work. I work in the dark, it should come to the light."" - Anthony Edwards"
"Karl Anthony Towns missed 22 games  Russel missed 30, and Beasley missed 35 games.  They are an underrated team, also edwards probably gets better"
"As a Mavs fan mine is obviously Luka, but outside of him it's Kawhi. Simple, effective, ultra efficient scoring while looking completely unfazed and elite defense.  His series against the Mavs this year is some of the most ridiculous basketball I've ever seen. Plus, watching him palm the ball and move it around like it's an orange is just hilarious to watch. Also an underrated posterizer, especially since he got the Clippers for some reason  For non superstars it's Anthony Edwards. Dude is hilarious and very fun to watch. His dunk on Watanabe was just fucking ridiculous"
"1. Jazz 2. Lakers 3. Nuggets 4. Suns  5. Warriors 6. Mavericks 7. Grizzlies 8. Spurs  9. Trailblazers  10. Clippers/Timberwolves  I'd love to be surprised and see the Kings or Timberwolves actually get into the play-in picture. But it seems like whenever I put trust in them to be decent they find a way to disappoint. When it comes to the Timberwolves though, having a healthy KAT and D-Lo along with a defensively improved Anthony Edwards that should be enough to make a difference this time around. When it comes to the Kings the talent is certainly there I feel...however Luke Walton is still around. My hope is that Walton finally gets the boot during this season and Alvin Gentry takes over."
"De'Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, Anthony Edwards, Ja Morant come to my mind."
"Any idea why Wolves fans were so high on Rosas?   His notable contributions in my mind are:  2019 - Drafts Jarrett Culver with #6 pick.  Culver is no longer on the roster.  2020 - Drafts Anthony Edwards with #1 pick.  Edwards is a good prospect and it's hard to criticize this that much, but I think most NBA people would put Lamelo #1 in a redraft.    2021 - Trades a lottery pick in the Russel/Wiggins trade, which to me is a trade the wolves badly lost.  Fires Saunders and replaces him with Chris Finch.  Wolves get a ton of criticism in the media from players and analysts for their shady hiring process.  I guess they were trending upward? but it's not like this dude has been dunking on the league."
Im not a wolves fan but I would absolutely not give up Anthony Edwards for Ben Simmons
"t'wolves fans, are you willing to trade anthony edwards for simmons? It seems like, this a edwards/picks/salary filler for simmons is your best route to form a mini banana boat with dlo/simmons/kat."
"do not forget the wolves prevented sachin gupta from taking the gm job in houston, which is only proper if they intended to eventually promote him from within.  this is the eagles going with jalen hurts over carson wentz.  rosas (wentz) may be good but flawed in the leadership category.  whereas hurts (sanchin gupta) is highly regarded in the locker room and has talent that is respected by many front office executives around the league.  also consider, four years ago, the timberwolves ownership stepped in to trade jimmy butler away when their general manager was not making headway.  it was said mulltiple times this offseason, the minnesota timberwolves were going to improve at the powerforward position via trade, and they got nobody.  had they gotten larry nance, they would'nt be in a standoff with philadelphia over ben simmons.  may we also recall that not only did anthony edwards fall into minnesota's lap, because they surprisingly got the #1 pick, but also that edwards was not considered a great fit in minnesota because they already had d'angelo russell and malik beasley scoring off the dribble.  meanwhile, the fact that the wolves already have in d'angelo russell what the sixers wanted from markelle fultz in terms of a 4th qtr closer makes them the very best fit for ben simmons in the league.    the wolves desperately need what simmons does well (defense, rebounding, collapsing defenses in transition and facilitating), and they already have people who excel at what simmons does poorly (4th qtr shooting and scoring).   Simmons-Russell-Beasley-McDaniels-KarlAnthonyTowns"
I’d love to hear Anthony Edwards’ take on this.
philly fans erect as fuck rn edit: imagine they ship out Anthony edwards
Anthony Edwards will save kat
"Firing Gersson Rosas was a good move by the Timberwolves but executed incorrectly.  In his brief stint with the team he has traded away future picks to give the timberwolves the possibility of being an 8 seed if everything turns out perfectly in a stacked western conference.   Honestly, unless Anthony Edwards becomes an MVP level talent, the Timberwolves roster is constructed too poorly to be successful. They are doomed to be a bottom 5 Defensive team as long as DLo and KAT are both playing 30+ minutes a game. Offensively they have no excuse to be as bad on offensive as they are with the players that they have. Hopefully the full offseason with their new coach will fix some of these issues but some personnel changes are needed if this team truly whats to go anywhere."
"If Morey manages to fleece Anthony Edwards out of Minnesota, I want a hand written apology from every fucking idiot that said he ""over-played his hand"" and ""waited to long""."
Timberwolves about to trade Anthony Edwards and 4 firsts for Ben Simmons lmao
Anthony Edwards would play WR for real
Anthony Edwards will promptly swap the basketball for a helmet and training pads when KAT is traded      I could see ANT in a Cowboys or Packers uniform
Timberwolves hiring Elton Brand and then he immediately trades Anthony Edwards for Ben Simmons would be the ultimate Timberwolves move
Or Anthony Edwards + add ons. I don't think they'd trade one of KAT's friend group for another and there are ways to make the math work without DLo. It would be really stupid of the Timberwolves but they just fired Rosas so they might be about to get stupid.
"Gonna be crazy seeing Zion, Anthony Edwards, and Mark Vital from Baylor be pro bowl defensive linemen in the NFL in 2026."

Anthony edwards and Charles
"I get that but really look where they are at.  First of all I like their new GM. Gersson Rosas seems to understand the business well and has done a good job in his tenure with the Wolves. He managed to unload a bad contract in Andrew Wiggins while bringing in a player that is not worse and is very close friends with his face of the franchise, KAT. They drafted probably the most exciting prospect out of the 2020 NBA draft, Anthony Edwards, made the trade for Malik Beasely, and I think we were finally starting to see the results of that.  I know they sucked last season but they finally brought in a real coach last season, Chris Finch, got healthy, and played their best basketball late in the season. Their biggest issue was the defense and Simmons is one of those guys who instantly raises your team's defense.   The spacing issues he had won't really exist with KAT and the way he plays. KAT's kind of the perfect center to pair with Simmons. Simmons is long and athletic, everything D'lo isn't, which is why he's so good in transition. I could see it working well for the team to have Simmons initiate in transition and then have D'lo do so in the half court, perfectly playing to the strengths of both offensively.   Also I think Anyhony Edwards is the real deal, we may reach a point where KAT isn't the best player on the Wolves. You add Simmons to that and all of a sudden you are talking about a roster with a *lot* of talent.   If I'm Rosas and I have to include all my future firsts and swaps if I can bring back Simmons sending out no player better than Malik Beasely I'm making that trade every time."
If Nando De Colo can go over to Europe and dominate and become a fringe NBA player. That’s telling Anthony Edwards could over to Euroleague and completely dominate over there. The Rockets would destroy whoever won the Euro title
lmao they'd need to do a 1 for 1 with Anthony Edwards at minimum. Probably add a first too with a role player.
"This is going to really backfire on a player someday. De'Aaron Fox or Anthony Edwards will resign with their team, ask for a trade after two horrible years, and either lose two years of salary or suffer through two years of playing for a horrible team"
You just created an injury for Anthony Edwards wtf bro
Anthony Edwards and health.
Anthony Edwards is good for a few quality sound bites per interview.
Get Anthony Edwards out of Minnesota.  If he goes to Philly this could be a young Shaq and Kobe situation.
"&gt; Minnesota shopping ant for a star, since he’s extremely raw right now and they desperately want to win and keep kat around.  anthony edwards has much higher upside than either haliburn or mitchell. that you even make this comparison shows you're arguing in bad faith.  minn is trying to trade for ben XDDDDD"
"Avoid watching Anthony Edwards  He’s too athletic for 99.99% of people to replicate his game not just in the world, but he tested in the 99th percentile for vertical, acceleration, and decelerating in the NBA.  I’d tell them to watch Ricky Rubio, but learn to shoot."

"Joining the league in 1990 the Minnesota Timberwolves drafted all time great Kevin Garnett in 1996 and proceeded to have this legend of the sport for his best years until 2007 at which they were able to draft Kevin Love in the 2008 NBA draft who proceeded to give his best All NBA years to the Timberwolves up until 2014 at which point they traded him for the #1 pick in the 2014 draft, Andrew Wiggins as well as selecting future All Star Zach LaVine in the same draft. In the next year Minnesota would proceed to solidify their young core taking the greatest shooting big man of all time Karl Anthony Towns at #1 in the 2015 draft to add to their young core. To provide leadership to this team Minnesota brought on former coach of the year Tom Thibodeau and then traded Zach LaVine for perennial 2 way All Star Jimmy Butler. As the Butler situation soured in early 2019 Minnesota still had their young superstar center and had traded Andrew Wiggins for the young Brooklyn All Star DAngelo Russell. Immediately that 2020 draft Minnesota had the option to draft LaMelo Ball but opted for the young stud Anthony Edwards to create a new star studded young core.   Minnesota Timberwolves all time record: .394 win rate and 9 playoff appearances in 31 seasons."
This team is much better than the 7-59 Bobcats... Edwards would carry this team to quite a few wins. I don't understand any of these comparisons.  rookie Kemba -&gt; Cole Anthony   Hendo -&gt; Dillon Brooks   Maggette -&gt; Markieff Morris   Diaw -&gt; Nic Batum (sorry too easy)   Biz -&gt; Biz (again... too easy)  DJ -&gt; Trey Burke   Higgins -&gt; whoever the worst SG in the NBA is right now   Reggie (holy shit I forgot he existed) -&gt; Denzel Valentine?

"This post was built for me.   1. Robin Lopez has the looks to replace BJ but he’s way better than him.  2. Edwards as Tyrus Thomas size wise makes sense, but give me MKG for game fit.  3.

I wouldn’t trade anyone else they were all perfect because they were the Bobcats. May they Rest In Peace"
Anthony Edwards is the next Klay.  The dude is awesome.
Anthony edwards
"1) There is an absolute 0% chance the Wolves have any interest in a Simmons/Edwards swap. The same goes for the Bulls and Lavine.   2) The 6ers lineup with Ben just sitting on the bench and getting nothing in return is likely, at best, a 2nd round exit team.   3) Since when do James Harden and Anthony Edwards have the same skill set? Do you watch basketball?"
"Sixers are well poised for Ben to stay home.  They have Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton competing for minutes already, and then drafted Jaden Springer.  Milton is a legit nba player, and Maxey looks to be even better.    This is a Khawi Leonard-San Antonio holdout/injury situation.  Both sided need to call it a mental health break, like Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka did.    Considering Philly's bench also includes prospects they are high on and want to showcase for potential trades, like Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Bball Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, seems to me the Sixers can win on the court and develop at the same time Ben sits out.    If any of Chicago, Portland or Minnesota gets off to a poor start while the Sixers and Embiid chug along, philly's chances of getting Lillard, Lavine, or Edwards increases.    Edwards most likely, because KAT, Malik Beasley and Dangelo Russell and Jaden McDaniels all fit around Ben Simmons  better than Edwards if the Wolves were to trade for him.  Plus, Morey built a team lat year suited for James Harden, stands to reason the next best thing would be a prospect with Harden's skillset like Anthony Edwards.  ."
Wait I got this. Simmons bad. Westbrook bad. Anthony Edwards good.  And now we wait for the updoots
"Why would a unprotected pick from a team that has KAT, Ben Simmons, Anthony Edwards, and D'Lo carry a lot more weight than one from a team led by whoever is leading the Spurs?"
I’ll take 3 Lebrons with a side of Ben Simmons and Anthony Edwards
"Disclaimer, I'm fairly new to basketball:  Luka, Lebron, Giannis, Myles Turner, Anthony Edwards"
So the reason I keep hearing about potential Sexton trades is more because of the emergence of Garland more than Sexton's deficiencies?  Also Rubio was a great mentor for Anthony Edwards and I think he will be the same for Garland. He also seems to perform better when he's playing for any team besides the Wolves.
Anthony Edwards idc
You know who's better than Lame-lol?  ANTHONY EDWARDS BAYBEEEEEEE
"If you don't think Anthony Edwards on a rookie contract is one of the best assets in the league, you're an idiot. No two ways about it."
Calling Anthony Edwards one of the best assets in the league is delusional. He's not even the best asset in his draft class.
Anthony Edwards.
Harden&gt;Curry  Harden&gt;Giannis  Harden&gt;Kawhi  Jaesean Tate&gt;Anthony edwards  Brook Lopez &gt; Gobert
"&gt; Even 1st overall picks aren’t guaranteed tbh.  They aren't *guaranteed* to succeed, but there is such a huge difference between #1 and #2. #1 picks average almost as many win shares as the #2 and #3 combined. Occasionally you get an Anthony Bennett but #1 has a very high likelihood of success.  Since 2000, the #1 pick has been an all star every time except 9 (so 57% all stars) and that's including Ayton who probably *will* be an all star and Anthony Edwards who it's a little too early to tell, but I still included all of them except Cunningham (ie, all of them who have actually played).  Of those 9 who didn't make an all-star game, I would argue there are only 3 true busts.  Kwame Brown: Bust  Anthony Bennett: Bust  Andrea Bargniani: Bust  Andrew Bogut: Still had a good career  Greg Oden: Injuries. If you want to call him a bust you can, but to me it's a little different if the guy's career is derailed by something like that versus just not being a good player.  Markelle Fultz: Injuries  Andrew Wiggins: Still a decent-ish player  DeAndre Ayton: Too early to say but *probably* not a bust. Seems really good actually.  Anthony Edwards: Too early to say"
"As a blazer fan from 2004- June 2021 I would love cj on the team. He fits great with Joel due to his lack of need of pnr, has a decent half court off ball passing game, and his huge amount of gravity anywhere on the court relative to his nba value. The whole summer I was an advocate of CJ + Roco for tobi + Thybulle + Paul Reed as I think it would push the blazers to being easily one of the top 5 in the west and the sixers into championship contention.  That all being said, I don't think CJ + Tobi + Joel is a championship contender. What ever somewhat possible trade happens in the next couple of months, up to and including Anthony Edwards, the sixers will be in a worse possition. CJ + Roco + Simmons + Nasir does not replace the value of a 24 year old all nba player on a 4 year contract. What the sixers need are trade assets and players that are easy to build around. CJ is great, but D'Lo is a better facilitator. The blazers assets exist, but are not as good as the Timberwolves."
"Honest question: Why WOULDN'T younger stars like LaMelo , Jalen Green, Anthony Edwards etc try to ball out in this tournament? Especially if it gives them more national TV airtime and helps build their brand??   I think people aren't seeing the vision of this... bc it can actually help young teams trying to build comradery , and also showcases up-and-coming stars in the league. Everything doesn't have to revolve around whether Lebron will participate or not.."
"I'm in the process of watching all the Kings games from last season, and Kings fans on their sub gave me loads of detail about aspects of the team I found interesting and confusing (the link is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/pmve6u/ive_begun_watching_the_kings_202021_season_not/) and to emphasise the real value is in the responses).  Optimistic because Haliburton is so, so, undersold and it shouldn't be hard for the team to realise what they have in him. I think people don't notice him as much because the areas where he lacks a little (neither the flashiness of LaMelo or Anthony Edwards, no pull-up midrange or much self-creation) tend to be the areas that get highlights. This is a player who within maybe five, ten games was running a great offense when he had the chance. His passing is spectacular, his ability to guard his man is spectacular, he's 41% from 3 on 5+ attempts per game, he has amazing IQ, and he's come into the league already an established good all-around player. In the games he started the Kings had a .500 record, and I *think* most of the time he was starting was due to injuries to Fox/Hield, so that record was achieved even with a partial roster.  Buddy Hield is still a positive player, and his weaknesses will hopefully be covered a little better by a) eliminating entirely the few instances when he's asked to come up the court with the ball, and b) a smarter team defensive identity (he really is very, very bad on that end). But the defense *and* rebounding are the biggest issues. So much can unlock for the team if they can manage even a 20th ranked defense and/or 20th ranked ability to defensively rebound (instead of dead last in both categories). They run the fast break really well (mostly because Fox thrives with those chances), so anything that gives them more of those opportunities is going to impact the offense in a massive way.  I'm beginning to think Walton isn't actually as bad as people say, but that's different from being good. The roster isn't well constructed so it's a difficult challenge for any coach, *but* the improvements needed are smaller than the benefits they'd bring so I'm still optimistic."
"From Hoops Hype:  &gt;Darren Wolfson: My understanding is Gersson (Rosas) communicated with Daryl (Morey), maybe some others in the Philadelphia front office... 'OK, KAT off the table. Anthony Edwards off the table, everybody else on the table.' But then like in the same breath, my understanding is D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons... They have a relationship. They played together in high school, that Gersson would love to have D'Angelo combined with Ben here."
I couldve sworn Anthony Edwards got 40+ twice at age 19
Anthony Edwards almost did the same thing last season but there was like 8 seconds left in the game. He realized he fucked up halfway to the rim and tried to pass it back but he was just blindly throwing the ball behind him. Rookie mistake.
“Here are a few of the notable names that missed out: Anthony Edwards.”
For Anthony Edwards wasn't it?
"If it ain’t Anthony Edwards at the top, it’s not a good list"
"Anthony Edwards dunk is legit a top dunk of all time. Maybe not the best, but it has every aspect of a nasty dunk. Also because he was a rookie I felt like people were afraid to crown it. If that was Lebron, people would be talking about that more."
This could be fun if it’s unproven/flashes potential:   RJ Barrett/Cam Reddish/Anthony Edwards/Lamelo/Cade
C: Nikola Jokic  F: Tobias Harris  F: Klay Thompson   G: Anthony Edwards   G: Luka Doncic
On that timberwolves note. Anthony edwards is special. That is all
"Anthony edwards, Jaden mcdaniels.  Timberwolves circa 2020."
Anthony Edwards pretty funny from what I heard
Anthony Edwards and Lamelo were both coming off the bench at the beginning of last season. So clearly you're just making shit up lol
All NBA with Jimmy’s help. Then KAT rebelled at the tough leadership style of Jimmy and hasn’t been that since. KAT could have at least led a team to an 8th seed. Let’s see if he can get them to a play in this year. Seems that he’s not a number one option. They didn’t have one once Butler left. Anthony Edwards may be that though.
"KAT is soft as wet tissue paper.  For all his prodigious offensive talent, he might be the softest player in the league.  He makes Ben Simmons look like Jimmy Butler.   He also plays like he doesn't give a shit on defense.  Put Anthony Edwards heart in KAT's body and he'd carry the Wolves to a high seed and be a threat in the playoffs."
Jaden McDaniels and Anthony Edwards
Gotta get in all the shots we can before Anthony Edwards comes into his own and becomes the next Wiggins!
"youre very clearly not over this, if you were you wouldnt still be getting upset about the things im telling you  jaylen brown has been the most consistent improver on a year to year basis i think the league has ever seen. the strides hes been taking are historic. unless anthony edwards (a guy who has yet to make any tangible improvements to his game in 3 years) can improve in similar ways to jaylen brown i have very serious doubts that he ever even sniffs an all-nba team  scoring is a facet of basketball, but unless you can do other things (which anthony edwards cant) youre not going to be a great player like youre affirming him to be"
"I’m embarrassed reading our fans replies. 1 we weren’t good 2 Lowry left 3 that makes us worse it’s as simple as that. I wouldn’t be so adamant about a rebuild if literally every other team got better in the east and have lapped us in offensive talent. Making our defence pretty irrelevant at higher competitive levels. It makes the most sense to ship out vanvleet and siakam for young talent that have higher scoring potential and build around og Barnes Gary Trent Flynn and a star level offensive option like a haliburton to try and compete in the future. A pipe dream that I have is shipping them both out with Boucher for Anthony Edwards and contracts, debate this with me in the comments because I feel like this trade is beneficial for both teams."
"Lmao dude you’re so full of shit. Talkin bout “people pretend they know so much when they don’t” and in the same comment saying “I know that jaylen brown works 10x harder than Anthony Edwards”. Get the fuck outta here with that shit, why would you think that you know that? Like I said, good luck with whatever package you end up getting back. I’m very much over this"
KAT is 25. He's on a max deal for three more seasons. The team brought one of his best buddies in the league (there is video of KAT saying D'lo isn't just a friend he's more like family) and Anthony Edwards looks like a real talent.   Anything could happen of course but I think it's more likely that the Wolves make the playoffs in the next three years than KAT asking out.
Except Anthony Edwards apparently.    We had to add 2 inches in the off-season so he could be listed appropriately at an NBA height.
"I am seeing anthony edwards and KAT being thrown around. Either would be stupid for the TWolves (which is not to say they wouldn’t do the dumb thing, they are very capable of that)  What other packages are there? I could see D’Lo going for Simmons, but I’m not sure about the financials of that. Maybe a package of Pat Bev and Malik?"
"&gt;Thanks for making my point dude. And we say no to any deal where it’s a straight CJ for Ben swap, or a straight RoCo for Seth swap. 2 FRPs and 3 SRPs are not enough to make the difference. Remove Seth from this deal and it’s a little fairer - but we still don’t do it.  Alright, so, what do you do if Ben sits? Just let Embiid get injured trying to carry and have no help coming in AT ALL? Let 36m just sit there?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I am not being a homer, but if your only argument is “why let 36m sit on the bench because Buddy and Bagley is the only other offer”, then your thinking is flawed. We’ll trade him to Minny for DLo, McDaniels and picks at that point and keep Seth.     1) Sixers already declined a D'Lo deal according to [this source.](https://section215.com/2021/08/30/philadelphia-76ers-minnesota-simmons/)   2) Wolves want to keep D'Lo according to [this source.](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/09/01/report-timberwolves-talking-about-karl-anthony-towns-anthony-edwards-dangelo-russell-ben-simmons-core/)  Either way, the Sixers are in the bad situation."
"you were just complaining about how ben simmons wasnt committed to getting better. so the fact that you are completely willing to ignore anthony edwards being completely unchanged during the time that hes supposed to be undergoing the most amount of mental development is pretty telling to how much youre committed to understanding the situation  and youre acting like ants decision making isnt a *weakness* when it really is. most all-nba players, even when they are 19, are not as bad as ant is. and the only reason it looked like he was a better decision maker down the stretch of the season is because of how god damn easy it is for him to capitalize on his gravity (which is why its so frustrating that he isnt better). he can make the simplest of reads and make things happen, similar to zach lavine, but the value these have is limited and until he can prove that he can do more than just swing the ball when defenses start to commit (which he hasnt really)   i know that its popular to hate on ben simmons, which is why you do, but it kills me inside whenever people try to pretend like they know so much when they absolutely do not. i know that you guys lack some pretty fundamental knowledge, but just come on, use your brains, ben simmons has made 3 consecutive all star teams and the only reason he wouldnt make another is because of the public perception of him, not that his impact is lacking. you know this and still maintain that a guy whos realisitc ceiling is as a all-star completely eclipses his value  honestly, give me an example of a person going from being an absolutely awful to good decision maker? the only one i can think of is jaylen brown, and i *know* that jaylen brown works 10x harder than anthont edwards does"
"Team USA could be a powerhouse in soccer if the top guards in the league opted to play soccer over basketball as their main sport as a kid.  Imagine Derrick Rose, Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox or Anthony Edwards playing soccer."
Derrick Coleman and Andrew Bynum with league average caring about basketball. (Soon to be joined by Anthony Edwards.)
"with the magnitude that were talking about? its so much fucking polish lmao. hes really underdeveloped and if you honestly think that him being as good of a player as simmons is right now is a sure thing youve got another thing coming  anthony edwards, even if he starts to actually start making his shots on anywhere even close to a consistent basis, is still so undeveloped as a decision maker that his impact is capped super low on any team looking to compete in exactly the same way as in zach lavine is, but more so  anthony edwards is still struggling with the same issues he has been for years, and considering how vocally disinterested he is in basketball, i dont really understand why you guys are so certain that hes going to be better than ben simmons"
Anthony Edwards. Book it
Anthony Edwards or no deal
"I think it really comes down to whether the Wolves think they can win now with Simmons or not.  I can see a Anthony Edwards, Beasley and Beverly for Simmons work. I  wouldn't throw any picks if I'm including Edwards, but again I would only do that if I thought adding Ben makes me an immediate title contender.    In my opinion, it doesn't, they are still very far from that, so I wouldn't touch Edwards as I think he has a higher ceiling than Simmons.   I would do Russell and some picks, but how would Kat feel about that since that's his best bud?"
"&gt; The 76ers would accept Anthony Edwards    I, too, want one of the funniest dudes in the NBA."
"I’m sorry but you’re wrong, embiid and simmons took the 76ers last year to the 1 seed.. add Anthony Edwards to that you get a definite title contender. You guys had the 7th overall pick with your squad last year, a pick that you didn’t even get to make. Only a bunch of 12 year olds would be genuinely unwelcoming of a player because of beef, honestly could be possible that the twolves sub is mostly 12 year olds so you could be right. But people would forget pretty easily once all of the media and their uncle starts talking about it the twolves can beat the Lakers"
"being a good scorer &lt;&gt; being a great player, anthony edwards is not a sure bet to even be the first one and is even farther away from being the latter"
&gt;	Would accept Anthony Edwards or KAT straight up     ^Of ^course ^they ^would
"""The 76ers would accept Anthony Edwards or KAT straight up for Simmons"" lol shocking"
the wolves wont even trade anthony edwards *straight up*   youre not getting a package of equal value for ben
&gt;The 76ers would accept Anthony Edwards or KAT straight up for Simmons   No shit.
&gt;The 76ers would accept Anthony Edwards or KAT straight up for Simmons    This just keeps getting more and more ridiculous lol. I’m sure the wolves would accept embiid for Beasley straight up too.
Why is the Timberwolves FO incompetent? because they don't want to trade away Anthony Edwards for Ben Simmons or because Gersson Rosas doesn't share /u/NandoDeColonoscopy opinion on Simmons's trade value? It's incompetent to try and lowball the 76ers?  Besides Jon Krawczynski is credible journalist who doesn't just report what the FO tells him.
"Jon K's athletic article includes this:  &gt;As of right now, the Timberwolves do not have a trade package that offers Morey the win-now assets a team in championship mode wants. They are not going to put Karl-Anthony Towns into any type of multi-team deal to try to get the wheels moving and Anthony Edwards remains untouchable as well. Even if the Wolves did include D’Angelo Russell in an offer — and they have talked all summer about building a team with Towns, Edwards *and* Russell around Simmons — it would not appear to be the magic bullet move that Morey needs to part ways with one of the best defensive players in the league … yet.  He acknowledges that the FO indicates it's keeping DLo, but his article makes it feel less firm than KAT/Ant. Hard to tell if that's speculation or the vibe he's getting from the FO. In a round table, he keeps that tune:  &gt;By my estimation, the Wolves are the team that has the greatest desire to add Simmons right now. Just one problem: They are not parting with Towns or Edwards and very much do not want to move Russell, which means they don’t have a great package of win-now players to offer a team that doesn’t want to rebuild, but wants to contend for a title.  in all, I'm not getting a reading of ""untouchable"" for DLo like our fanbase is saying"
"Actually not true, it depends. LaMelo, Anthony Edwards, Wiseman, and Pat Williams all had 2001 birthdays and they were a grade older than Cade, Suggs, Barnes, and Mobley who also all had 2001 birthdays. In fact Williams is younger than Barnes. I guess it’s up to the parent when they start school."
"If Paul George said the same thing the whole Reddit gonna be calling him soft, but everything Anthony Edwards said is good for some reason, I guess that’s Reddit (aka regular people chat room)"
"Anthony Edwards on playing against Rudy Gobert:  ""With a guy like that, you can't stress about him rebounding. That's what he's gonna do. Motherfucker's 9'7"", 475 pounds. Ain't nothing you can do. We could box four people on him and he's still gonna grab the board."""
Anthony Edwards of his energy and interviews alone might be my favorite young player in the league
"If this was Anthony Edwards, sure"
&gt;We could put four people on him and he's still gonna score the ball.  I see Anthony Edwards was watching game 6.
Anthony Edwards might deserve the MVP for making KAT and DLO give a shit.
"I just love Giannis and Caruso. They're probably my two favorite players right now. In the group are Anthony Edwards, Ja Morant, Luka, Lamelo, and maybe your mom"
"Remember when Timberwolves started Anthony Edwards and he has huge usage? And people started calling him shit and bust the first half of the season without even giving him a chance. All the rookies need is a chance, not everyone comes in and become Luka, Magic or LeBron straight away. It’s like trying to employ fresh grads engineers but expecting them to have 10 years experience."
Anthony edwards for real one of my favourite players right now
He’s closer to Anthony Edwards maybe
Anthony Edwards didn’t know who AROD was
"Despite having much more talent than us since 2000 y’all only have 7 more wins in that timeframe, and that’ll probably disappear after this season. Your franchise is known for wasting the careers of star bigs. Hopefully Edwards can lead y’all to relevancy since Charmin-Anthony Towns isn’t a leader.  Can you imagine Towns on a contender? Hope there’s a way to manifest that since it obviously won’t be in Minnesota."
Anthony Edwards is built like an NFL Running Back with the moves of James Harden

Jalen Green is like if Ja Morant and Anthony Edwards had a love child.
Anthony edwards is going to say the wrong thing one day and people are going to turn on him so fast
"KAT might have finally got it. and when i say 'it', i mean Anthony Edwards."
If you don’t love me at my Andrew Wiggins you can’t love me when I’m Anthony edwards
ANTHONY EDWARDS IS AN ALL STAR
Anthony Edwards is turning into something special right before our eyes. Attitude is there. Potential is there. He’s putting it together now.
ANTHONY EDWARDS
What abt Anthony Edwards?
Anthony Edwards.
I'm all aboard the Anthony Edwards train
"I fully expect Anthony Edwards to take that spot. He's got unlimited ""Chuck"" potential."
Anthony Edwards in the distant distant future would be amazing
What if you had the athleticism of Anthony Edwards with the passing of LaMelo Ball.   You'd have Ja Morant.
"Can call me biased but I think it’s Anthony Edwards, certainly for most explosive. Idk about fastest with guys like Ja and Fox though.      [When he was measured,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kb8z28/anthony_edwards_body_tested_accel_force_99th/) they found him to be in the 99th percentile in terms of acceleration, 98th percentile in deceleration, 98th percentile in lateral acceleration. At 6’4 and 225 pounds.      He’s probably the greatest athletic “freak” in the league behind Giannis and Zion right now ([and for what it’s worth, the 2021-22 NBA GM Poll identified him as such](https://www.nba.com/news/2021-22-gmsurvey))."
"Anthony Edwards was asked a few days ago about his willingness to shoot so many threes so far this season and he made a pretty good point about how when he shoots threes the driving lanes open up, so he’s going to keep shooting them."
"I don’t think they’re unlikable but I do think a lot of them are really boring and bland.   Anthony Edwards, Ja Morant, Trae Young are injecting a lot of life into the league. I like Scottie Barnes’ energy. We need some juice"
I fucking love Anthony Edwards
Professional actor like ER/Top Gun star Anthony Edwards.
Anthony Edwards will become a top 3 or better player in the league
"-The NBA contracts need to change in some way that doesn’t allow players to secure a bag and then force themselves out. James Harden or Ben Simmons wanting out is fine by me but there has to be some sort of disadvantage to leaving your team like that. It just seems too lopsided in the players favor.  -Grayson Allen to the bucks was one of the best off-season acquisitions. As a SEC basketball fan I don’t like him but damn, he can play D shoot 3s and doesn’t commit costly turnovers. I would say he might be the 3rd most important acquisition behind DeMar and Lowry.  -speaking of DeMar, no one talks about how he just got a career high in assists last season because he was in SA. He is an all star.   -Brandon Ingram and Zion don’t work well together.  -the second half Anthony Edwards rookie season showed he’s most likely all-star bound sooner rather than later  -Russ was right about P Bev. He’s just running around fooling everyone. He doesn’t really bring anything to a team.  -Dwight Howard was elite in Charlotte"
"DLO is definitely not a scrub who snuck into the league, which is precisely why I believe he knows how to pass a basketball.  And doesn’t need Anthony Edwards to tell him.   It’s just a few games."
“There’s no ‘I’ in ‘team’”  - Anthony Edwards.
"We haven't seen too much of Suggs as the primary playmaker in the regular season because he's been starting at the 2 next to Cole. We haven't put him in a ton of PNRs as a result. When we have he's been with Lopez at the 5 due to having half our roster injured and Lopez has been really terrible as a roll man (he's soooo slow).  I've noticed he tends to get in the air and then try to pass out, which he needs to cut out.  As a scorer, he's gotten visibly better each game. Hit 4 3s last game (4/8) and 2 were pretty deep. He's struggled in the paint but he's really been getting beat up when he drives and he can't buy a call. It reminds me of the first half of Anthony Edwards' rookie season. Just constantly getting mauled - I think the combo of being big and strong and a rookie worked against them both because refs let defenders get away with damn near anything. 2nd half of the season when Ant started getting calls he was suddenly averaging 24ppg.  I think in both aspects the game hasn't really slowed down for him yet, which is hardly surprising for a rookie PG 4 games in. He has struggled with balancing the two, and right now you can pretty clearly tell when he's in playmaker mode and when he's in score mode."
Hopefully Anthony Edwards continues to blossom as a scoring option and D’lo can play more of a playmaking role while reducing his scoring load.
well Anthony Edwards has played for more than a year I think TWolves are in good hands 😂
"""If I retire and play baseball it ain't finna be in the minor leagues""  - Anthony Edwards"
"Other than my team, I'm rooting hardest for Anthony Edwards."
"You’re not wrong it’s just if suddenly the wolves aren’t as good, everyone will say “I thought Anthony Edwards was going to hold these guys accountable and now the team sucks again and he’s not shooting as well.” and they’ll just use it against him"
"I think a big difference is personality, Anthony Edwards doesn’t seem like he’ll get as irritable as Jimmy is. Anthony also is in his 2nd year so I would like to imagine he’d be more respectful"
Anthony Edwards is such a leader for only being in his 2nd year
"He directly benefited from the covid draft.   It was the worst year for being able to scout prospects, and the worst year for information, pairing that with the draft not really having any sure things and all the top prospects being considering risks with Anthony Edwards having a ton of athletic upside and Lamelo being a flashy exciting prospect but major concerns with his efficiency."
"From an article for the Pioneer Press Twolves beat writer: “There would be no sugarcoating on this evening. It was time to identify the problem, the culprits and the solution. It was time for the 20-year-old Edwards to lead. Minnesota has three lethal offensive weapons in Edwards, D’Angelo Russell and Karl-Anthony Towns. Those three, Edwards noted, are to blame. ‘We think we the only ones on the team. We got to be willing to pass the ball,’ Edwards said. ‘There’s no ‘I’ in team. We can’t beat five people with three people. We beat five people with five people. We got to be willing to play with our teammates.’”"
"[Anthony Edwards (seeming to reference him, Kat and D-Lo):  ""We think we the only ones on the team. We got to be willing to pass the ball. There’s no “I” in team. We can’t beat five people with three people. We beat five people with five people."" Edwards (cont.): ""We got to be willing to play with our teammates. Trust our teammates and like I said share the ball."" ](https://twitter.com/ChristopherHine/status/1452847625963819017?t=wRbPqnwbIzpf2nIjg8WgZg&amp;s=19)  &gt;""Preseason everybody is sharing the ball. Everybody happy. So when the season starts everything changed. I. I. I. I want to shoot this. I want to shoot that,” Edwards said. “Like coach said in practice the other day, JO playing his balls off on defense, don’t get no shots on offense. Jaden plays his balls off, don’t get no shots. Beas runs the floor hard, don’t get no shots.”   He also said this. So it seems like he understands the situation very well."
anthony edwards
Protect Anthony Edwards!
anthony edwards was stomping my team but he is just electric to watch. i'm glad he's doing so well especially after people seemed ready to shit on him after the beginning of last year
Anthony Edwards: Finals MVP
Tyrese Haliburton and Anthony Edwards
I'm ready for the Anthony Edwards vs. Jalen Green dunk contest
"Nah not hating lol. It's just that anthony edwards is now 6'6, and one of the most athletic players in the league who is buckets. He's going to need the ball in his hand more.   Might cash in with dlo and get a 3 off ball decent defensive capable player like Harrison Barnes,   the hawks having alot of forwards,   Orlando having Cole Anthony, and mo bamba. (Kat not good paint defender)   Feel like the pelicans would be the type to trade ingram for dLo if the Timberwolves put a pic in there.   cam Johnson on the suns since cp3 is not getting any younger and dLo and Booker are BFF."
"Hawks vs Timberwolves to be exact.  Timberwolves win 4-2 behind Finals MVP Anthony Edwards’ 34/11/4/.6/1.5 on 60% TS.  They go on to 5-peat, landing Ant and KAT squarely in most people’s top ten all-time lists and get raised in discussion with Kobe/Shaq and Bron/Wade as the best duos in history."
OP suggest you change title to...  Anthony Edwards and the Timberwolves try to show that a new identity is forming  Edwards is clearly the alpha dog on that team.  Kat had 6 years to be that... It will be Ant .
"I really really like this Wolves team. After the ""spooky"" era ended, it was looking pretty rough for their future. KAT spent a good part of the last 2 years hurt, but now he's back in the best shape of his life and could be set for a career year.  Anthony Edwards is really damn good and I can see him averaging close to 25ppg this year.  There just feels like there is a completely different energy and vibe surrounding this team. I can absolutely see them making the playoffs."

"I was referring to Anfernee Simons as Ant, not Anthony Edwards. But yeah Edwards is incredible too"
Time for Anthony Edwards to put the team on his back.
Loool It’s been only two games and Silas is not really running plays for him or anything  I do think his rookie season is gonna be a lot similar to Anthony Edwards
He reminds me of Anthony edwards the first half of the year last year. He will be fine.
Anthony Edwards is pretty nice. First time seeing him play.
I suggest they trade him to Minnesota for Anthony Edwards. Then he has to be teammates with a guy who lost 6 family members and his mother to covid.
Zion fat or not. Anthony Edwards is another one where his body weight + athleticism makes him a scary mismatch. Dude is 10lbs away from a NFL LB at 6'5
"&gt;Which player is the most athletic?   1. Zion Williamson, New Orleans – 27%   2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee – 20%   3. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota – 17%   4. Zach LaVine, Chicago – 13%   5.

"Giannas and Zach lavine are the obvious choices.   Low key sleepers is anthony edwards, mikal bridges, Andrew Wiggins"
"Anthony edwards, jalen green, and me"
"Tj Warren at his best in Phoenix was better than last years Anthony Edwards. Aside from them it’s just dlo, who’s a great player but he’s not a big enough difference maker to purely outweigh that defence and make them a legit playoff team.  Minnesota’s defence will more than likely make them worse than Memphis, and if they make the playoffs it’ll be due to kat or ant getting red hot in the play-in and them slipping in"
Anthony Edwards would have had 60 on his own lmao
Anthony Edwards. Zion.
"It has a bit to do with inflation but mostly with the NBA vastly expanding.    A lot has changed with salary cap and salary negotiating over the past 30 years, but to keep it simple, I'll just compare his contracts with similar recent contracts and how it would change with inflation.  In 96, the salary cap was 24.3M. Adjusted for inflation, it would be 42.13M. The salary cap for this season is set at 112.414M.   AI was the first pick in 1996 and signed a 3 years/8.9M contract. Adjusted for inflation, it would be 15.4M. Anthony Edwards was the first pick last year and signed a 4 years/44M contract.   He signed his rookie extension for 6 years/70.88M in 1999 set to kick in in 2001. Adjusted for inflation, it would be 116M. Luka just signed his super max 5 years/207M set to kick in in 2022  He then signed a 4 years/73.5M extention in 2004. Adjusted for inflation, it would be 105M. Last year, Giannis just signed his 5 years/228M super max.  After being bought out by the Grizzlies,AI finished his career with a 1year/1.03M vet min in 09. Adjusted for inflation, it would be 1.3M. Carmelo just signed a vet min for 2.5M."

"I wanted him to be good so bad. I’m not out on him yet, but it seems that KOC and I will may have been wrong about how he should’ve been picked ahead of Anthony Edwards"
Schrodingers' Ben Simmons; can be considered both an overpaid liability who can't play and an all star with 4 years of team control worth Anthony Edwards + picks
Anthony Edwards is just better and that makes their Canadian brains collapse at the thought that anything in their franchise isn't phenomenal
"Anthony Edwards has the most boring name, how are we supposed to remember him?"
"Lol I saw raptors fans freak cause Anthony Edwards was ranked over OG on the top 100. OG's a role player nothing more, he is not a first option."
It happens when one Anthony Edwards plays for your team
"Anthony Edwards so far looks like a more special player to me than KAT, but I really appreciate the KAT respect."
Anthony Edwards is going to be a stud

I'm so glad Anthony Edwards was the 2nd jersey I bought
Anthony Edwards is the Black Michael Jordan
"Anthony ""Kirill Kaprizov"" Edwards"
Anthony Edwards is going to be All-time
Anthony Edwards with 24 points in 19 minutes. Holy fucking shit.
"yeah, turns out ANthony Edwards is actually pretty good at basketball"
"Anthony ""Johnny Sins"" Edwards"
So close too. I wish it went in. That highlight would be better than Anthony Edwards posterizing Yuta.
Anthony Edwards all star season

Anthony Edwards is gonna be a superstar soon and that's just a fact

"Dejounte Murray's gotta be. IMO he's just back to where he was pre-injury, these are the stats he was putting up at the beginning of that season.  Anthony Edwards was good enough last year (well, he flashed bright enough) that he'd have to be an MVP candidate to be viewed as improving that much."
How good do you guys think Anthony Edwards will be? He’s my favorite under 21 player.
I bought League pass just to watch Anthony Edwards play. Dude is a freak of nature and electric.

Lol Anthony edwards has got to be one of the weirdest guys in the league
ESPN tomorrow: Is Anthony Edwards running an undercover drug empire after work?
Anthony “Trap God” Edwards
Man y’all kill me with the exaggeration sometimes. It was a nice dunk with some contact but this isnt an absolute poster. You need more body contact for it to be an “absolute poster”. Sengun mostly dunked around the the defender  Sorry for the rant but titles like this have me expecting Anthony Edwards/John Collins kind of posters.
"Nah just Vando, Pat Bev, Okogie, Anthony Edwards, DLo and McDaniels"
Anthony Edwards is the best of all time.
I’m going to keep saying this about Anthony Edwards until everybody knows………..  This man is that dude.
I’m going to keep saying this about Anthony Edwards until everybody knows………..  This man is that dude.
Klay for Anthony Edwards and a couple unprotected 1st round picks
"Anthony Edwards plays every game which I love, lotta minutes some games too"
This dude is so much more likable as a non-Laker. Imagine if Anthony Edwards was a Laker.
Is Anthony Edwards' shoe deal with Adidas expired? It seems that he is wearing Nike now.
"&gt;	Anthony Edwards killed Gabe, and today he rose like a Phoenix.  He didn’t have the decency to wait 3 days!"
Anthony Edwards unlocked Gabe Vincent’s Ultra Instinct
Gave Vincent has awoken his powers since Anthony Edwards put his nuts in Vincent’s face
"Anthony Edwards killed Gabe, and today he rose like a Phoenix.  We are in a new era, Heat fans.  GG bulls, you gave us absolute hell.  I’d say let’s meet in the playoffs but actually I don’t want a heart attack."
You ~~Warriors~~ Anthony Edwards are good.
Anthony Edwards is an inefficient chucker
Definitely. Another one that comes to mind is he's totally gushed over Anthony Edwards the last couple times we've played the Wolves.
"It's not a true poster if the guy doesn't jump or make a play on the ball. Unless it's a nuts in the face type of dunk like VC or Anthony Edwards...that's a poster regardless. But the defender won't even jump or be in the way of the hoop and they'll call it a poster lol you can't ""poster"" someone if they're behind you trying to chase you down from behind."
Anthony Edwards has the potential to become one of the  best scorers in this league while Lamelo's ceiling is properly a 18/8/8 guy. Dont use one game to justify you Hornets thinking somone like Melo is better than Ant😂😂😂
"Anthony ""(Titan) After Earth"" Edwards"
The most surprising thing about this game is that Miles Bridges and Anthony Edwards combined for zero dunks.
"I enjoy watching Anthony Edwards play basketball. He is my favorite NBA player.  When he ends Gabe Vincent's life, I think to myself ""yes"".  When the ref calls it a charge for no reason, I think to myself ""no""."
So we shouldn’t show replays of Anthony edwards dunk cause  it was a charging call ?   It didn’t count so technically he didn’t “ finish “
Anthony Edwards is my favorite player in the league so TWolves
"Well give some Context Ant has way more talent then Kat did.  It’s also much harder to lead a team as the only Big on your team.   Kat literally had role playing Wiggins to work with, Anthony Edwards has an entire team.  Beasley would arguably be the 2-3rd best player on those Kat teams and he’s coming off the bench for us.   This is just widely unfair of a comparison to make.  The year Kat had jimmy we were a 3rd seed for awhile."
"Anthony Edwards is doing something that KAT wasn't able to do since getting drafted. Just shows that Anthony Edwards has the right winning attitude necessary to help a team win.   Meanwhile, KAT is always acting like a positive dude but he's always sulking around and doesn't know how to play winning basketball and doesn't have a winning mentality.   Anthony Edwards is a winner. KAT is a loser. I remember KAT trying to teach Thibs how to run the defense because he was lazy AF to follow Thibs' defensive schemes. Imagine, a young center trying to teach a veteran defensive coach how to play defense. LOL. I will never forget that."
"According to NBA defensive ratings #2 is Patrick Beverley, D'Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, Jarred Vanderbilt and KAT"
this man knows everything about basketball and me apparently maybe if you were out there anthony edwards wouldn't have made it on sportscenters top 10
"&gt;For Minnesota, having floor-spacers so guys like Anthony Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell have room to operate is important.  That trade makes no sense. Beasley is already a floor spacer. The trade doesn't even save the Wolves any money. Kennard is getting paid a similar amount for an extra year."
"Anthony ""Always Entertaining"" Edwards"
Nah he just a hater idc what he says  I’d rather see a CRAZY almost poster than a less impressive finish   Did you not see that Anthony edwards dunk called offensive foul?
Bias from a guy that can’t dribble just spot up n shoot. Was everyone not suppose to go crazy and replay Anthony Edwards dunk cuz it don’t count. JJ shifting into broadcaster mode now.
"Anthony ""American Eagle"" Edwards"
From now on I will only refer to Anthony Edwards as “Shit Ant”.
"What this should read is “after Anthony Edwards travelled, Jimmy Butler grabbed the ball, then got half-heartedly pushed by Anthony Edwards. The players very briefly squared up then left each other alone.”  The whole “this guy is tough” “this guy doesn’t want to fight” bullshit is just that, bullshit.  You lot just love to overreact to the slightest things.  “Stared him down” means more than a cursory two second look ffs 😂"
Anytime Anthony Edwards dunks 😂😂😂
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
He's been better than Anthony Edwards at the same time last year and will get better. Still better than Cade but I'm sure we're still make excuses for him.
1. Luka Doncic 2. Ja Morant 3. Trae Young 4. Zion Williamson 5. Jayson Tatum 6. Anthony Edwards 7. Lamelo Ball 8. DeAaron Fox 9. Tyler Herro 10. SGA
1) Karl-Anthony “Big Purr” Towns 2) Jarred “First Team” Vanderbilt  3) Anthony “Da One Jack 🚶🏿‍♂️🚶🏿‍♂️🚶🏿‍♂️” Edwards  4) D’Angelo “DPOY” Russell 5) Patrick “GRIT AND GRIND LETS GO 🏀🏀” Beverley  In no particular order
"Anthony Edwards is the real deal folks. As good as lamelo has been, Edwards was there right choice st 1."
Anthony Edwards exposed as a head pusher
"Tbh Jimmy did the right thing for him and the T-Wolves, they wound up realising that they needed to split up Wiggins and KAT as soon as possible, and wound up getting Anthony Edwards who is a much better pairing personality wise (Wiggins + KAT = 2 dudes who dgaf). The T-Wolves should be thanking Jimmy."
"&gt;The lack of whistles or bad calls that go against Anthony Edwards is absolutely ridiculous. The Timberwolves are not officiated like other teams and I've watched enough basketball in my life to be able to come to that conclusion  I'm a homer, so take this with a grain of salt, but I 100% agree. Both Ant and KAT should have 4-5 more FTA per game than they do, if not more."
"lol LaMelo is literally 3-4 tiers above Anthony Edwards as a basketball player, going by stats, advanced metrics, or eye test. like its not even worth putting Edwards in a conversation with him at this point."
"Every time Blake Griffin dunked 10,000 Kia Fortes were released into the wild. I don’t see Anthony Edwards doing the same just yet"
"To be fair to Ant, I would have answered this question a little differently. Vincent was still moving after Ant had already left the ground. 100% not an offensive foul and then when you factor in how crazy of a highlight it is, the fact a whistle was blown is a flat out joke. I've been watching the NBA for 20+ years now. The lack of whistles or bad calls that go against Anthony Edwards is absolutely ridiculous. The Timberwolves are not officiated like other teams and I've watched enough basketball in my life to be able to come to that conclusion"
Anthony Edwards was the best player on the floor
"It’s true he jumps all the time and I absolutely admire it, Anthony Edwards killed him in a poster last year but he is still jumping ☝🏽"
You haven’t seen Anthony Edwards much I’m guessing.   He is everything Wolves fans hoped Wiggins would be.   Wolves would do the Wiggins trade 10 out of 10 times
"Career?  The guy just died.  And poor Mrs. Vincent, she hates herself for it, but only Anthony Edwards can please her now, and a woman has needs."
Can you imagine a world in which Kat had that Anthony Edwards mentalit
"I get the NBA wanting to showcase zion and giving the pels all these marquee games, they had no idea he was gonna be hurt so long  But anthony edwards is a force of nature.  NBA should put him everywhere.  Dude is like prime russell westbrook except with a 3 point shot."
"its criminal how few nationally televised games the twolves have this season.  they should flex a few in  let the people have anthony edwards dammit, he's unbelievable"

It’s a travesty to skip “I keep it so fresh on the microphone” when Anthony Edwards raps.
You love to see it. young Wolves were gunning for Jimmy Butler and his squad all night long.. Anthony Edwards is all heart!
"ANTHONY EDWARDS IS SHOWING THAT ANTS, CAN, KILL!!"
If that 22 guy on the heat keeps working he could be like a mini Anthony Edwards
ANTHONY EDWARDS WAS OUT OF BOUNDS
Anthony “Baby Jimmy” Edwards
"Is Anthony Edwards not off the ground in the pic you just linked? It looks to me that his back foot is off the ground and the left sneaker's reflection in the paint makes it look a few inches off the ground, while if I try to go frame-by-frame it looks like Vincent's feet are still sliding into position while Edwards is springing into his dunk. Still, super close either way."
"Could have been a combination of the crowd plus having to score against Vando, McDaniels, and Anthony Edwards. You saw he was quick to try to score on Beasley and Dlo."
Anthony Edwards: “It should count”
If he was this player for you guys then you wouldn’t have Anthony Edwards rn so that should make it a lot sweeter! Kid is a stud
"The last thing I would want Jimmy to do is take a shot with fragile sophomore Anthony Edwards on the court, wouldn’t want to hurt the poor baby."
Anthony Edwards:  - Showed up  - Dunked Gabe Vincent into he shadow realm  - Refused to elaborate further  - ~~Left~~ Ejected  Woulda been some GOAT shit
call anthony edwards a priest.  He just baptized Gabe Vincent.
anthony edwards is the key to all this
"Nope. Arrest mr. Anthony Edwards *---for not being lightskin, on that play!*"
ANTHONY EDWARDS
"Butler will end up making around $400-500 million in salary in his career, plus more from endorsements, and has a decent number of investments.  With the league gaining value, Anthony Edwards might come close to making a billion in salary throughout his career. We're already seeing rookie extensions in excess of $200 million.   Edwards is only 20 right now. There's a decent chance he signs a $220 million contract at 22. Starts a $300 million contract at age 27. Signs a $350 million contract at age 32, and then signs a $120 million contract at age 37 to close out his career."
"FUCK JIMMY ""ANTHONY EDWARDS WANNABE"" BUTLER  FUCK THE HEAT  LET'S GO BABY"
The T-Wolves are fun as hell to watch. They’re constantly looking to get out in transition and Anthony Edwards is an absolute superstar in the making. He’s the first guy I’ve seen approach the level of athlete prime Westbrook was.
i can't even be mad Anthony Edwards is legit  ggs
ANTHONY EDWARDS IS 20 YEARS OLD
Anthony Edwards.
Anthony Edwards &gt; Rachel Nichols boy toy
"Imma say it. For a team that talks about how tough they are, calling themselves the kennel and other dumb ass shit, they sure do fucking crumble under any type of adversity. Letting Kat and Anthony fucking Edwards of all people get in your heads is textbook definition of soft. Getting blown out in the second half of all these losses is textbook soft.  I know that's blasphemous to say, Heat culture etc, but to me they are not at that level."
Anthony Edwards is gonna be everything Jimmy thinks he is
Anthony Fucking Edwards.
I don't give AF  Holy shit Anthony Edwards is a fucking monster WTF
Anthony Edwards has redeemed the soul of the Timberwolves.
I suspect the wiseman pick will haunt warriors fans for decades. Right now it looks more likely that wiseman busts as hard as anthony edwards as he is actively regressing from being a bad player to worst player on the court every night.
I agree it's too early to call but man this is about as bad as it could be going. You'll usually see flashes of greatness even if a rookie is terrible and inconsistent (anthony edwards this year is a good example) but what flashes has Wiseman shown? what is he even good at right now other than just being big
Anthony “no more bullshittin” Edwards
tonight is a regular tuesday evening for anthony edwards you clown lmfao
"How do you know they will have at least 2 top 3-5 picks? Can you tell me if I’m going to win the lottery? Seems like you’re assuming there’s 100% that the Nets will have a terrible record, and the pick will hit 1-5 with the new lottery odds.   And probably the most laughable thing you assume is a 50% chance that a single top 5 pick will be better than Ben Simmons? That would essentially mean that you think Simmons is the average top 5 pick, which is just hilarious. The top 5 picks from the last 2 drafts were Zion, Jah Morant, RJ Barrett, DeAndre Hunter, Darius Garland, Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, LaMelo, Patrick Williams, and Isaac Okoro. The only guys that have even shown the potential to be better than Simmons are Zion, Jah, and LaMelo (3/10)"
yeah not to mention the fact rookie rj was still more efficient than anthony edwards to this point
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/  because you're obsessed with shooting splits as if they tell the whole story here's another stat to compare them with  RJ's Raptor Metrics:   Box Score Raptor: Offense:-0.4 Defense:-0.7 Total:-1.1  On/Off Raptor: Offense:+0.9 Defense:+1.9 Total: +2.8  Overall Raptor: Offense: -0.1 Defense:-0.2 Total:-0.4  WAR:2.0  Anthony Edwards Raptor Metrics:  Box Score Raptor: Offense:-2.7 Defense:-2.7 Total:-5.4  On/Off Raptor: Offense:+0.9 Defense:-3.9 Total: -3.0  Overall Raptor: Offense: -2.0 Defense:-3.1 Total:-5.1  WAR:-1.8
At least 15 of those shots should've been fouls. Watching him get mauled by opposing players with zero foul calls gets annoying. I remember the game against the Twolves when Anthony Edwards was getting soft calls all game and Book was getting fouled arguebly worse with no call.
"His 3 point shooting was a bit underwhelming but 20 PPG on 52 TS% as a 19 year old as the number 1 option with either Chris Wilcox or Jeff Green as your team’s second best player is pretty impressive.   Look at the shooting % of Anthony Edwards this year for example, and Edwards has better players surrounding him."

Rui calls Anthony Edwards Oto-san which means father.
"I mean rookies are very rarely considered even average players in comparison to the whole NBA. Especially not Anthony Edwards. I don't see the surprise that Wolves are bad when they made him the first option for a big part of the season.   Edwards has the lowest true shooting percentage in the league among guys with such high usage; lower even the infamous chuckers like Russell Westbrook or Andre Drummond. The fun fact is that he doesn't even stand out that much in a team with Rubio, Okogi, McDaniels, Nowell or McLaughlin.  They're a bad team, although they are closer to average when they have Karl-Anthony Towns fit. Either way they will be among worst defences, but with KAT they are closer to average offensively.   Yeah they're tanking, I guess it was not the plan when they'd got Rubio or D'Angelo, but these guys didn't change nothing and it turned out like always."
CONFIRMED: anthony edwards is an astro boy style robot created to get buckets and posterize defenders
I think both. Anthony Edwards is really really good and taking a swing on the lottery isn't a bad thing long term.
Anthony Edwards supports this message.
"I didn't say anything about Haliburton.  Anthony ""48% TS"" Edwards is certainly below Lamelo lol"
On what planet is Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton on a level well below Patrick Williams
Don't sleep on Anthony Edwards! Also he was kinda mean to RJ
Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels exist.
6’5 Anthony Edwards just had 3 actual blocks in a game tn
"Anthony Edwards sliced us the fuck up at the end, holy shit"
Anthony Edwards was not the Impostor tonight apparently!
"That is only 21 minutes less than KAT, Anthony Edwards, and D-Lo, not bad"
"You should go look at KD's rookie season stats.  People are high on Anthony Edwards because he oozes talent and potential, but is also raw as hell. Maybe it doesn't work out, as is the case with Tyreke Evans. But there's also a chance he puts it all together and becomes a bonafide perennial All Star."
"Lol a small role, he plays the same amount of minutes as edwards. It’s clear you still have a very elementary level of understanding given you’re citing edwards ppg in this context. No, efficiency is not the only thing that matters but a 12% ts gap is 1.5x the difference between being the worst and best offense in the league.  You also need to at least have a baseline level of efficiency for your points to actually be helping your team. Anthony edwards has a horrific 48.3ts%. His “scoring” is not helpful. Anyone can score 20 ppg if they take enough shots.  The Worst offense in the league has a 53ts%. Edwards’s efficiency is far worse than even the worst offense in the league. The Wolves as a team has a 54ts%, and it’s not like hes making a ton of plays creating for his teammates. All of his scoring is useless, and the team would convert those possessions at a higher rate without him.  Edwards is objectively a terrible NBA player, which is fine, as he’s a rookie and can develop and was drafted for his potential. But he’s currently a far worse player than Haliburton and a net negative player"
"Yeah he reminds me some of last years version of SGA. I think SGA now has gotten alot better but in terms of floaters, scoop shots, not being able to quite get enough separation to get to the rim, not being super athletic finishing at the rim, willing shooter at all 3 levels etc. SGA has a slow release which affects his catch and shoot 3 point attempts, in Haliburton's case he has more a line drive 3 point shot which can affect how often he can get it off vs taller defenders. As a passer he reminds me some of Derrick White, Haliburton's main passing value is on drives + manipulating and looking off defenders till the last second  Anthony Edwards I think the hope kind of has to be he's Donovan Mitchell with more strength when it comes to finishing at the rim while probably not being as good a catch and shoot 3 point shooter."
"He definitely knows how to suck up to the media. Every game he follows the same script. Look up their best/most popular young player and heap praise on them in the pre game interview. But to make sure to basically write their headline for them with a quote.   Tomorrow it will be ""Collin Sexton is very underrated. He is one of the top young players in this league"". And all the local media and fans will love him.    Then two days later...  ""Anthony Edwards has a little bit of DWade. He's going to dominate this league for a long time."""
"Right. We all know how the award gets voted on, but the dude basically said Haliburton is trash which, especially compared to Anthony Edwards is just lol"
"Curry, Anthony Edwards, Hunter, JC, Embiid?  Could go to the finals but idk if they win"
Anthony Edwards is just literally bad at everything  He's young and he's far from finished but he is really just bad at every single thing right now
"Kyle Lowry, John Collins, Robert Williams III, Anthony Edwards, Demar Derozan.  Defence blows so we're probably a first round exit."
"&gt;1. Tyrese Haliburton, Sacramento Kings  &gt;2. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves  &gt;3. Immanuel Quickley, New York Knicks  &gt;4. Jae’Sean Tate, Houston Rockets  &gt;5. Saddiq Bey, Detroit Pistons"
Anthony Edwards is 4 years younger than him
Anthony Edwards draymond and KD
Lmao they can easily flip Ben Simmons for more assets. Minnesota fan mentioned flipping Ben for Anthony Edwards + filler + picks.
"Lol at prediciting Kareem to the Lakers.  If KAT is on the move i'd pounce on that, I think he's just miscast as a #1.  KAT is the best floor spacing big man ever, Anthony Edwards and the rest of the not ready for prime time players aren't ready to do something with that space.  He's still elite and i'd have him in my top ten most valuable trade pieces."
"He doesn't because he doesn't open up the paint like KAT does. Anthony Edwards started his ascent this season as soon as he started playing with KAT, coincidence?"
Minnesota plays really hard. Younger longer teams can get to this Nets team. KAT is a beast which is nothing new. Anthony Edwards plays like he loves the game so the pre draft concerns were BS.   Good game. On to the next
"Timberwolves did a good job of fighting back but they gave Anthony Edwards an isolation against Green when it was a 1 possession game with something like ~30-40s left.    Green isn't some lockdown defender but I feel like that's not a great play to run out of a timeout.   Also, love Harden's self awareness in the post game interviews, he's always willing to hold himself accountable first and foremost."
"Not a big fan of an Anthony Edwards isolation on Jeff Green as the play they drew up after a timeout.  Green isn't some lockdown defender, but that's not some big mismatch either."
Anthony Edwards is the real fucking deal.
He must have practiced with Anthony Edwards over break.
Anthony Edwards has been bad to the point of farce defensively. Bad even for a rookie.
"I want to address this as that's what the big headline post in this sub is about. NBA fans love to WILL superstars to glamor teams and get pissed when they go ""nope, I'm good!"" Dame is a prime modern example since Westbrook finally left his throne. Every year that Dame doesn't win will be a year the media will go ""...Dame should team up with X in Y"" and will start nagging about CJ needing to do the same.   These narratives wear on these athletes - nobody can tell me otherwise. I await when SGA is up for RFA and the media goes ""WELL HE'D FIT IN PERFECTLY IN X!"" as if he can't be his own man in OKC as proven. Shit, KAT got an explosive Anthony Edwards and I still see stray pokes of ""should KAT force a trade outta Minny???"""
"I think Anthony Edwards will, more likely than not, be a very good player. He has all sorts of unbelievably favorable attributes, especially his burst in getting to the rim.  I also think that Edwards is, over the course of the 2021 season, a very bad NBA player who should not win ROTY.  Is that too much to take in?"
Yeah Anthony Edwards isn’t really good because some 40 year olds on Reddit told me he’s 2nd last in “RAPTOR” 🤓 yall sound dumb
anthony edwards have a shot though
that was Anthony Edwards
There are other things to consider when drafting like team needs and ceiling. There's a reason why Anthony Edwards and Lamelo Ball went ahead even though they aren't as fundamentally sound.
"I feel like the Younger Millenials or Gen-Z guys would do it. The current generation of players already pretty much dropped the whole ""I will hate you if you're not on my team"" stuff.   Boomers get all mad at that, complain about the league being too ""buddy buddy"". Even though even back in the day it was all mostly for show.   Magic and Larry were friends, as was Barkley and MJ.   So the next gen going a step further and kinda breaking the entire concept of ""franchises"" by just aligning their 3rd UFA in their 30's and doing whatever to form a super super team also kind of ironically seems fitting.  The other thing is... the kids coming in are going to getting PAID PAID.   Devin Booker for example:   * Rookie money = $9M * Rookie Max = $158 * Vet Max= $200M (and this will end when he's 30/31.   He could potentially sign another $200-250M deal and still be valuable at 34/35  Anthony Edwards is starting off with his first four years getting $42M. The rookies that get drafted with the new TV deals could be making A LOT more."
Anthony Edwards up there
Yeah the comments are racist but he’s trolling here. He gave himself away when he had the Yuta Watanabe/Anthony Edwards post.
"Fox has been unbelievable since the break. They just need to fire their coach and they’ll get better.   They have a good squad and now that Melo is gone, Haliburton should win ROY as he’s exponentially more effective than Anthony Edwards.   Just gotta ditch the coach. Walton is Boylen/Brown/Saunders level bad."
Thankfully Anthony Edwards' TS in March is a gaudy .515!
"&gt;Anthony Edwards has been improving consistently as the season is progressing.  Why do people just lie about this prospect? He's still absolutely terrible on defense and is now arguably shooting his team out of games *worse* than he was before because of the insane green light he has right now.   I call it insane because they keep letting him hoist up 20 shots so he can make 5-9 of them and they expect to win or have him improve when he's not held accountable for this tunnel vision, hero ball, chucking shit. Did it at Georgia and now he's doing it in the NBA. Again, just don't get it."

"Die hard. Die hard Lakers.   Then I follow KD, Harden, Anthony Edwards, and Zach Lavine."
KAT  Anthony Edwards  John Wall  Christian Wood  Kelly Olynyk   I could see them winning a game
"I went through a ton of Anthony Edwards film earlier in the season. I'm probably lower on him than like 90% of people right now, but one of my main takeaways was that he really is getting boned on calls at the rim.  Edwards has a lot of drives where he flies at the rim out of control, the defender contests vertically, and he misses and looks goofy. However, because of that tendency, it feels like referees are way too hesitant to give him calls when he actually does get fouled."
"Damn, I must been watching only highlights too much because the way Anthony Edwards been dunkin’ on cats, I swear TWolves been decent but I didn’t know they were that bad. Damn."
anyone can take allot of shots on a bad team  anthony edwards should not be starting
"Anthony Edwards is probably the sweet spot. Tall, but not freakishly and you get that crazy athleticism."
"https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/sports/basketball/6850411-Analytics-say-Wolves-rookie-Anthony-Edwards-isn%E2%80%99t-getting-foul-calls  This is one of them, there’s more"
Anthony Edwards is a dud and Damian Jones or Trezz can't stop KAT. I'll take the W.
The wolves have picked Kat who is a star and Anthony Edwards who is a rookie at 1 lol
I just wanna say that Anthony Edwards is cute
but that has nothing to do with Anthony edwards or this thread .. comment is acting like they shoulda got edwards instead or something like it was possible
Damn is Anthony Edwards really just improving every single game he plays ?
do you guys have a moment to talk about our lord and savior Anthony edwards?
Anthony edwards is oozing with talent
Bro Anthony Edwards plays with no conscience lol.   I wonder how already having the opportunity to take this many shots as a rookie will affect his development
anthony edwards looks like he's faster than everyone in the nba without even trying
"Oh 100% and I'm so happy another team gets to see what he's really like. He's not perfect but he's a human who loves the game, and uses the ""aNaLyTiCs"" to have more info when he's making big time decisions.   At the end of the day trading for the OKC version of Harden was a bet on Harden being really good as a #1, and not some algorithm saying to do it. Turns out his gut feeling was beyond correct, and the analytics along with eye test, film, scouting, etc. helped support his intuition.   Speaking of people being unfairly criticized for being ""detached"" from the game, Nate Duncan's very similar to Morey imo. I listen to his pod a lot and he geeks out on highlights like a regular fan, but he also utilizes stats to have more info. I mean the dude does a top 10 dunks of the month and he's like a little kid describing them lol. Very few people watch more games than him.   Fwiw the Anthony Edwards dunk tweet was poorly timed/worded and I didn't condone it, but he explained how it wasn't meant to be hot takey, just Edwards' stats in a vacuum. But the Twitter mob projected their anti-analytics/nerd biases, ignorance, and primal feelings on him and it was a big deal for a day lol."
You mean like calling Anthony Edwards a bust bust because they were you hopped on basketball reference and checked their fg and 3 percentages
I like this take.  Anthony Edwards is fun af to watch.
"Obligatory ""fuck Trae young"".  Lamelo ball or Anthony Edwards 👌"
"Thank you, ig this is why Anthony Edwards did the same? He wouldn’t have gone number 1 if he went with Cade n em right?"
"What are random advanced stats you don’t like?   My theory is people don’t like them because they expose players they like as ineffective. So they do the whole wAtCh tHe GaMeS bit as if fans who pay attention to advanced stats aren’t already doing that. I don’t get why NBA fans are so resistant to advanced stats when the MLB has already shown us it’s the future. The NBA is the most predictable sport of all the majors because these advanced stats are so useful and accurate.   Let’s take a look at Anthony Edwards. Dude has been objectively terrible this season. His points per usage is heinous, his TS is abysmal, and he’s third worst in the league in wins added. That’s all really, really bad. He’s just absolutely chucking and playing a ton of minutes. And he’s barely getting to the line.   Good volume numbers doesn’t mean a player is actually effective.   That’s not to say he doesn’t possess the skill to turn it around, but he’s been pretty trash this year and not a lot of people would know that if all they do is look at box scores."
Steph curry for Anthony Edwards? Might be a steal since AE can never be steph.
Anthony Edwards takes over 15 shots a game and shoots 9 TS% below league average
Any metric with Anthony Edwards as second to last has its shortcomings
Anthony Edwards and Giannis? LaMelo and Luka?
Anthony Edwards will be big deal and more talked about than LaMelo in 3 years
"The most explosive player rn has to be Anthony Edwards, he has to atleast be up there."
"Zion rivals prime Westbrook in terms of sheer explosiveness and the ability to jump with little to no, headway.  Anthony Edwards is very close as well. He's very quick to get up.  I feel that the Spurs young guys, Keldon and Devin are sneaky explosive as well. They get up better than you think they would   Giannis isn't explosive as the others. He's got great strides and reach so that accentuates the impact of his dunks."
Anthony Edwards hasnt been a bright spot?
"For those who don't know who he is. He is the brother of Jalen from the Hornets. He was a top 5 high school prospect who had a rough year at Washington before falling to 28.  He's a skinny 3/4 hybrid that was seen as a project that would take about 3 years.  Due to poor performances from all of the PF's on our roster as well as dudes filling in at the 4 (Okogie, Layman, Juancho) both Vanderbilt and McDaniels ended up being forced into rotation.  Jaden has been an absolute revelation for us. He's a fearless defender that loves to get a block and is a decent scorer putting up a career high against New Orleans.  He has been the brightest of bright sparks this season alongside Malik Beasley. Some of our beat reporters like Britt Robson even believe that he will be better than Anthony Edwards, whilst that is unlikely, the sky is the limit for Jaden"
"He’s a rookie without a summer league to get ready. Players take time to develop. Not everyone is going to come in and look like an all star right away. You may be right! But it’s way way too soon to be making these statements. It honestly just goes to show how impressive Lamelo, Haliburton and even Anthony Edwards have been. Most young players are just that young and need time to grow"
Anthony Edwards: Steph Curry is better than me
"This dude won me over, I remember when pundits were making their draft boards people had Anthony Edwards falling off  the lottery because of his 'lack of love' for the game or some BS like that  Glad he's showing the fuck out and with a great attitude to temper it all"
"Yeah I guess I’ve just been frustrated because he’s not only neglected to note that there is any issue whatsoever with the referees, he’s also not issued any punishments whatsoever for some of the comically bad refereeing this season (the Draymond tech for yelling at Wiseman). Meanwhile players still get fined for ejections or complaining about refs.   Additionally, the product has suffered. The ends of these games are awful. Reviewing a call they missed on Anthony edwards and then giving the ball to the other team!!! Why are you reviewing if you’re getting the call wrong!??? It’s a giant mess and Silver has given zero indication that its even an issue."
Ok I'm buying Anthony Edwards stock at any price. Just like GME this guy is going to the moon.
Reporter: Anthony I'm trying to compliment you.  Edwards: I don't give a shit  Reporter: I know
"""no"" - Anthony Edwards"
"Anthony Edwards was ok on ER but he's sucked at almost everything he's done since, including basketball."
"If tanking brought success, we would be successful.   What matters is creating a competitive culture. People think it is easy to do once you have the players but it is not.   Take wolves. We already have KAT, we have Anthony Edwards. I mean we should be able to start building around them. We have D'lo who can perform if he is utilized. We have Beasly, we have a couple of really good young talents. What is the point of getting another piece at this point? Another high draft piece can be used to acquire another player, true. But right at this point no good player will want to stick around. Just start winning ASAP. Tanking on purpose is the most stupid thing to do for us. Another youngling won't change our fate."
**2020:** Anthony Edwards with the 1st pick.   **2019:** Jarrett Culver with the 6th pick.   **2017:** Lauri Markkanen with the 7th pick (traded to the Bulls).   **2016:** Kris Dunn with the 5th pick.   **2015:** Karl-Anthony Towns with the 1st pick.   **2014:** Zach LaVine with the 13th pick.   **2013:** Trey Burke with the 9th pick (traded to the Jazz).   **2011:** Derrick Williams with the 2nd pick.   **2010:** Wesley Johnson with the 4th pick.  **2009:** Ricky Rubio with the 5th pick *and* Jonny Flynn with the 6th pick.   **2008:** OJ Mayo with the 3rd pick (traded to the Grizzlies).  **2007:** Corey Brewer with the 7th pick.   **2006:** Brandon Roy with the 6th pick (traded to the Blazers).
Is this about the Anthony Edwards dunk?
is this just because of the anthony edwards dunk?
Anthony edwards seemed to miss the memo
I can't believe he wasn't fired for drawing up a play with Anthony Edwards taking the last shot of regulation vs the Pacers.
"It's almost like Taylor saw Anthony  Edwards play and was like "" oh fuck I should probably not waste this talent."""
Who ? This franchise needs help. Timberwolf faithful better pray Anthony Edwards turns into a star.
Bro I got a fucking NBA notification from the ESPN app about a tiktoker making a terrible rendition of the Anthony Edwards dunk... How the fuck is that actual NBA news?!?
"They have one great player and he's been hurt/out a ton since last year.  Beasley has been great, but when KAT was out they weren't gonna win anything with Malik Beasley, Anthony Edwards and Naz Reid as the 3 best players of a team."
Anthony Edwards is wanted for the murder of 1 (one) man.  That's the only thing I could think of. we suck. I hope the Knicks make the playoffs. You fans deserve better.
"Andre Drummonds rebounding numbers are an obvious example. Blake Griffin this season is putting up empty stats this season as well (sorry blake), just look at someone like tyrese haliburton who’s putting up basically the exact same numbers but watching the game his stats are clearly more impactful. Anthony Edwards is another example, as much as I love his game the timberwolves are a team desperate for scoring and as a rookie he’s been tasked to help with a lot of that load. The flashes are there but his scoring numbers are not to the point where they are representing a positive impact on the team yet, but he’ll get there soon.   If we want to talk about inflated stats that’s a separate conversation but there is some overlap in some cases."
"Miles bridges, Anthony Edwards, Obi Toppin, Ja is who I want to see"
"I mean, Yuta got clowned on for the Anthony Edwards dunk...that’s not unique to Giannis."
"Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Miles Bridges for sure.  Others I'd love to see: Ja Morant, Jaylen Brown, Zach Lavine (Again)"
Draymond idk.  Dame said must be the shoes cause Anthony Edwards was wearing his Dames.
"Most NBA players can dunk; hell if Anthony Edwards couldn't do that he wouldn't be in the league, since athleticism's all he's got. It's much more highlight-worthy to go for the contest knowing you're going to get clowned."
"Obviously this stems from Anthony Edwards posterizing Yuta. Holy shit, that is one of the most spectacular poster dunks I have seen in my life.   That being said, why do fans clown a player so much for getting posterized? Shouldn't it be more disgraceful for being too scared to contest a dunk?  For you nephews and idiots who like to just repeat the same catchphrases like ""rIp, cArEER eNDed, etc"". I know it's hard but just try to think about it rationally.   When you get postered, at least you are showing enough courage to defend the play. Yeah you might get put on a highlight reel but at least you actually made an effort.   It should be even more embarrassing when a player ostensibly opts out of defending a dunk because they are afraid to get dunked on. They are literally too scared to even make a play. How is that not more embarassing?  Being dunked on is part of the game if you are actually trying to stop the other player. There shouldn't be any shame in that.   For the record, I do not mind the banter or trash talk but the hate has gone way too far on Yuta's social media. If you are one of those idiots spamming hate towards him or an NBA player because they are on the wrong end of a play, you should take a long look in the mirror and re-evaluate your life. How pathetic of a loser do you have to be to spam hate at another person."
"For what's worth, Yuta is a better NBA player than Anthony Edwards today. Anthony Edwards is showing his potential but as of now is just an inefficient chucker who can't defend to save his life"
Personally as hometown Raptors fan I can say that I gained more respect for Yuta for absolutely taking that. While on the other hand you see Baynes stepping out of the way and not getting into the thick of it. It’s really annoying the mentality because each person should be respected but Anthony Edwards should have more respect cause damn that was the nicest dunk I’ve ever seen!
"I do have a question to ask ""did Anthony Edwards suck the gravity right out of the building when he dunk on Yuta Watanabe?"""
"Anthony Edwards: Bad, but with flashes of brilliance. Shows a variety of offensive skills that just need refinement. Super lost and unfocused on defense, specifically off ball and screens. Has been playing more consistent since starting, up until these last two games.  Jaden McDaniels: Defense has been great. Man to man and shot blocking. Can hit the corner 3 well. Potentially a high end 3&amp;D guy."
"Jaden McDaniels hasn't done anything outstanding, but what he is doing he's doing well with shotblocking and corner 3's  Anthony Edwards is inconsistent, but you can tell he will be a fantastic 2 way player for years to come"
This cracks me up. Anthony Edwards out here hooping and was sending shots at the sport I love before being drafted and yet here is is ending lives on the court. I'm conflicted
"LaMelo Ball good, Anthony ""Wiggins"" Edwards trash"
Do you care how many points Deandre Jordan had when he dunked on Brandon Knight? Do you care if the Clippers won?  Absolutely not. Who cares about Anthony Edwards stat line when he had an all time dunk
Nate just wants to gloat about being right that Lamelo would have been a better pick. It's annoying for sure. I don't think he's wrong but he doesn't have to shit on Edwards either. This isn't an Anthony Bennett level pick for instance.
"Anthony Edwards about to blow a candle out, on top of the rim."
"Holy fuck, I think I’m an Anthony Edwards fan now."
Or they have simply watched the 10 games with out AD. Don’t be mad your team was baptized by Anthony Edwards.
Anthony Edwards has really done well for himself following the end of his acting career on ER
yeah and now for the rest if his career he's gonna be the guy that got postered by anthony edwards. same thing happened to brandon knight and his career never recovered

Aww Anthony Edwards. I’ve been wondering what he was up to since ER

Anthony Edwards is only a rookie. Only 19! And he just became a father tonight.
"He completelyyy dunked on somebody, which is a big deal.  The defender is 6'8, taller than Edwards, and also defended it well and jumped to block the shot.    Anthony Edwards literally jumped SO high that he almost jumped over a giant person who was trying to jump and block him.  And also he put so much power into the dunk -- usually when you get a ""poster"" dunk (which is when a player dunks on a defender), it's a little less powerful than this, but Edwards jumped so high and cocked the ball back that he was able to *power* it through the rim.  And extra points that he dunked so hard that it completely knocked the defender over.  Basically dunks where people are trying to block you are always way more impressive than wide open dunks, and this is about as impressive as you will ever see in terms of a ""poster dunk.""    And also, you just have to admit it looks really freaking cool.  Like, how many people have you ever seen with the capability to do that??  It's wild.  I fucking *love* dunks."

I know the giannis over Hardaway dunk is objectively cool and impressive but ive never thought it *looked* that cool. I think it's telling that you couldnt even really tell what happened live. I'll take the Anthony Edwards dunk
Since Towns has came back the dude is in those is nearly 55fg / 45 from 3 / 90 FT.  And he averages 14 FGA.  He draws up game-winner couple days ago for Anthony Edwards who was like 3/15 again.  At this point just go the Net's/Nash route and throw a bag at KG or something to beat some shit into the players.

Guess Anthony Edwards and 2021 /2022 etc 1st pick will be happy to be considered as same generation with Lebron.
"Probably once a hyper athletic player fully weaponises the 3 ball. Say Anthony Edwards becomes a 40% 3pt shooter off the dribble and ends up with a similar range to Dame or steph then he'd be consensus best player. The answer is probably going to be somone like Suggs, Cade or Bates though."
"Anthony Edwards - OJ Mayo 2.0  James Wiseman - poor mans Toronto Chris Bosh  LaMelo Ball - prime Penny Hardaway without the injuries, MVP"
"Kevin O Connor said Killian Hayes was a better prospect than Anthony Edwards, James Wiseman, and Lamelo Ball lmao. Listen to this guy speak and you know he's never picked up a ball in his life."
lmfao to anyone who thinks Anthony Edwards is anything like Andrew Wiggins. Completely different attitude and mindset and Ant has shown to be a much better finisher and passer. Please watch some games and press conferences before making rash comparisons.
"Sub may be too young, but Anthony Edwards reminds me a lot of Anthony Peeler. Peeler is a couple of inches shorter, but their play styles are eerily similar to me."
"LaMelo Ball - The real Steph Curry w 40 inch vertical James Wiseman - Slow and less athletic left handed Giannis, can shoot way better though  Anthony Edwards - gonna be 80-90% of prime Dwyane Wade"
There are very few players in the NBA I would be more comfortable seeing take the last shot than Anthony Edwards as a defender.
Why does Anfernee Simons have the nickname Ant? Anthony Edwards being called Ant atleast makes sense

"This post should be labeled ""Anthony Edwards almost gets his career stuffed out"""
Safe to say Anthony edwards is back to being a bust
Why the fuck is Anthony Edwards taking the game winning shot. Ryan Saunders gotta go.
"I'm trying to reconcile my thoughts on Saunders as a coach.  There are some obvious flaws in timeout usage, lineup combinations, etc. that have undoubtedly lost us a few games this season.  But we also have *so many* young players that are outperforming expectations this season.    Everybody thought Anthony Edwards was extremely raw and would need time to develop (which he didn't get because of the covid changes), but he has gotten so much better so quickly.  Jaden McDaniels was picked at 28 and was recently listed as the 10th best rookie so far.  Naz Reid has taken his offensive game to the next level in year 2, so now he's a threat to pickup 20 off the bench in any game and has upped his rebounding.  I'm sure it's possible that happens despite him, but it doesn't seem fair to give him all the blame and none of the credit."
Is the Anthony Edwards dunk in the raptors game and the Rozier dunk over Durant in this set of photos? Scrolled through them but I might have missed them in my scroll.
"absolutely not.  Earlier this season when Anthony Edwards dunked on Watanabe, I posted a clip of T-Mac baptizing Shawn Bradley because the plays were pretty similar.  Someone replied to me saying the T-Mac dunk ""wasn't that impressive"" and that they ""could've done that in their college days"""

Anthony Edwards: I didnt want Basketball I wanted Football
"Wrong on:  * Anthony Edwards. I thought he was a really good prospect, but the shot making he showed in the second half of the season was really impressive and ahead of schedule IMO. * Sekou Doumbouya. He's still a very young prospect, but after two years he hasn't improved as much as I would have hoped. I thought he had super high potential coming out of the draft but so far he hasn't shown much.  * Grant Williams. I wasn't as high on him as some other draft people were, but I didn't expect to just be flat out terrible.  Right on:  * Jarrett Culver. Great college player but I never understood why he was such a high pick. He's an inefficient jump shooter and he's not athletic/explosive enough to be a great finisher. His offensive strengths (passing/ball handling) aren't very valuable unless his scoring is good enough to be an on-ball threat. By all accounts, he sounds like a great dude and hard worker so I do hope he proves me wrong in year three though. * James Wiseman. He looked really raw which I expected. I still think he has high potential moving forward, but I was not surprised that he was a net negative as a rookie. This one is a major TBD though because he could make huge leaps moving forward. * Desmond Bane. I'm a biased Grizzlies fan, but Bane has been really damn good this season. He's older so his potential is lower than most picks, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's someone who averages like 19/4/4 in his prime."

"Drawing fouls is part of scoring. Not only directly, but also because it changes how people defend you. Just look at someone like Anthony Edwards to see what it looks like when you have a hyper-athlete with a bevy of scoring moves that has no idea how to draw fouls. Massive weakness."
"There’s a lot of nuance involved at that level. If you’re a play-off team chasing a championship then it makes sense to trade the late first round pick for a player who can instantly contribute. The Nets traded the pick for Shamet because they knew he could stick in the league and was on his rookie contract. If the Nets win this year they should keep this years first because you need to add players who can earn playing time but are on a rookie deal so you go with a guy who only needs to contribute in a limited way like be a 3&amp;D player. Or you draft a player and develop him on your G-League team and sign ring chasing vets to fill out the roster.  The Warriors would probably like a do-over on the Wiseman pick. They like him a lot as a person, high character type of person with huge potential and the type of bridge player who can link the current GSW dynasty to the next dynasty. Maybe he will be that player but big men take longer to develop.  The pandemic screwed the Warriors at the last draft but they still made their decision. Anthony Edwards has definitely surpassed expectations this season but would he have excelled as much with Step and Wiggins next to him and with Klay coming back? I imagine Lavarr Ball put the Warriors off wanting to be associated with that family and Lonzo really only improved this season. But LaMelo or Ant Edwards would look great right now on the Warriors.  The Warriors should have also tried to send the number 2 pick and the upcoming Minnesota pick to a rebuilding team for a guy who could play for them this season."
devin booker. anthony edwards. steph curry. and lebron because he can score whenever he wants lol
Throwback to when kuzma said if tht was on the wolves he would put up Anthony Edwards numbers
"If they don't ? Then someone else will.. if they put all the games on national TV there are plenty of up-and-coming players in the NBA who would love that spotlight. This is one thing the NBA has never done, other than the ASG there's no stage that showcases great players who aren't household names.  Will dudes like Kyrie and Kawhi sit out, yeah probably. But I would love to see a Zion vs Ja Morant or LaMelo vs Anthony Edwards going balls to the wall in a competitive setting. Put something on the line and a lot of these guys will go hoop"
He doesn't owe us shit but that doesn't mean he's not a bitch.  Wait til Anthony Edwards or KAT demands a trade to the Lakers and get back to me.
Nah he just has the same amount of post high school game experience as Anthony Edwards. Also he’s insanely efficient on those shots

1. AC Green is everywhere 2. Anthony Edwards and Bill Russell is 6 degrees!  Cool stuff
This is sooooo cool. Six degrees between Bill Russell and Anthony Edwards.
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
Earl Lloyd and Anthony edwards was the only one I got 7 on so far
LaMelo Ball and Anthony Edwards will each finish with 4. Two will be together on the 2032 and 2033 Lakers.
Anthony Edwards and Doncic have no mutual teammate connection. That's a first huh
"In the end LaMelo had a 20 okay games,20 good games and 10 shit games.  Ant had 20 awful games - 15 okay games and 36 good games. It's just that LaMelo was good earlier in the year so everyone remembers him for that.   I'd try to watch Anthony Edwards play a bit before coming at anyone with ""you have bad takes"". Especially if its you."
bc people who think anthony edwards deserves roty over lamelo are mouth breathers
Willis Reed ... Anthony Edwards  six degrees
5 players between Anthony Edwards and Wilt Chamberlain 🤷‍♂️
Anthony Edwards should be Roy
I tried anthony edwards to George Mikan and it only took 7 degrees. damn.
Two teammates separate Michael Jordan and Lamelo Ball.  Three teammates separate Anthony Edwards and Lamelo Ball. LOL
5 between Bob Pettit and Anthony Edwards
that's some anthony edwards typa answer
"If anthony edwards was on a winning team, youd say the same shit about him."
"Anthony Edwards is actually self aware and funny though, Lebron wants to be cool so bad"
If Anthony edwards said this it would hit r/all
"If you removed Joe Ingles from the Jazz, how would that change the numbers?  He was drafted ""75th"" in 2009, and then signed by the Jazz as a free agent in 2014. What does this even tell us? The Jazz didn't draft him. They didn't even really develop him, he was already a pro for 5 years. He wasn't ever ""untalented"".  Anthony Edwards and LeBron get the same score, both drafted #1. How does making these two players equal in ""this is how much talent this team have"" even make sense?  Same goes for multiple #1s that are no longer elite players (Rose, Griffin) are both ""better"" than Durant.  This is some pretty flawed data analysis if you ask me."

I would totally vote for Anthony Edwards if I had a vote  A fun way to lose that voting privilege for life
Jaden McDaniels is playing but I wonder if Anthony Edwards will? I don't think he's going to get much benefit from playing against rookies and G league guys.
I remember being downvoted for saying Anthony Edwards has shown a lot of promise and was on an upward trends a little over a month ago. Shows how much r/nba knows.
Anthony edwards is the first nba player
how many fucking anthony edwards posts are we gonna have a day
I understand that and Ant was legitimately the worst player in the NBA for like his first 20-25 games.  But look at Ant's stats for the last 36 games and look at his %'s each month etc. It's better than anything that LaMelo has put up in his rookie season.  You definitely should watch Anthony Edwards more if you don't think he's the best rookie.
"True, and in all honesty ROTY is an award who’s criteria should not involve winning, or at least weight it so heavily. MVP requires winning as an essential evaluative factor of course, but ROTY should stand separately since the best players go to the worst teams.  For much of the season Anthony Edwards was in the worst situation out of any rookie, as the injured Wolves rolled out G league starting lineups under the incompetent Ryan Saunders. I personally don’t think this misfortune on the Ant Man’s part should impede his campaign for ROTY.  Plus Hornets without Lamelo and a healthy roster (Hayward) would make the 7 or 8 seed any day imo."
&gt;Anthony Edwards’ astronomical growth throughout the season     What an overdramatic way to say a player played better after the ASB...
&gt;Anthony Edwards’ astronomical growth throughout the season  What an overdramatic way to say a player played better after the ASB...
Sexton is just too inefficient but hes improved in getting peripheral stats. But def not worth that contract. I’d say trade him for a taller guard:better scorer. Someone like Anthony Edwards (I know he a rookie) would be perfect
"Jamal Murray's Instagram handle is jmglitxh27   The point I'm making is just because his Twitter handle is  ""KAI"" doesn't mean anyone refers to him as that. It is unnecessary to just start calling someone by a name no one refers to him as. If that were the case, I could just start making up names for players that no one has used to try and start a fad. I suppose we could start with calling Anthony Edwards ""T-ward"" and hope that catches on"
"NBA is definitely on a crusade against Anthony Edwards to lift up the perennially contending, massive market Charlotte Hornets."
"&gt; I don't think I agree with that  Edwards improved a lot throughout the season, and by the end of it he looked fantastic.  However, in those first ~30 games, Anthony Edwards was one of the worst players in the NBA"
Anthony Edwards
Was Anthony Edwards in the league last season? No? Then he had nothing to improve from.
"See Anthony Edwards name in post. Check user flair. Realize this wall of text is not worth reading.   Lamelo is the ROTY, barely even a debate. Go cry about your guy on the twolves sub."
This is pretty easy to disprove if you just search ant/anthony edwards in the search bar for the past two weeks-month and look at the comments in the threads.
how many anthony edwards posts are we planning on making
"Very much agreed about the cherry picked stats. I would have called it out myself if you hadn’t.   That said, this is what Ant fans have been seeing in reverse all year. There was an article from the Ringer a few weeks ago that used rookie stats to compare the top rookies from this class against historic rookies to “project” their ceiling. For Anthony, they chose his usage rate combined with his FG% and compared him to Dion Waiters, Coby White, and JR Smith. And then for Melo, they did some magic with his stats of like 15-5-5 to compare him to Luka, Trae, and Ja. It’s just infuriating to see the misrepresentation.   https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/4/20/22393182/rookie-comps-lamelo-ball-anthony-edwards-tyrese-haliburton  *edited to correct typo"
Anthony Edwards is the real ROTY
"? Who's ""y'all"" i think they're both good players lol   LaMelo: 15.7 PTS, 5.9 REB, 6.1 AST  Anthony Edwards: 19.3 PTS, 4.7 REB, 2.9 AST   I'd give slight edge to LaMelo but it's a tossup"
"&gt;The truth is Anthony is a lot more inefficient in comparison to the rest of the league in comparison to the rookies that OP is trying to compare him to  The idea is that the league as a whole is a lot more efficient now then it was when LeBron or KD were rookies, so their efficiency is more impressive relative to their peers.  As an example, basketball reference has a stat called TS+ which is your true shooting percentage adjusted by league average. As a rookie LeBron was at 95, while this year Edwards was a 91. So even though his TS% was better than LeBron's, it was worse when compared to the rest of the league at the time when it happened."
"Genuinely not trying to be combative here, but this is such a gross misapplication of stats that I gotta say something. Before I get started, I want to preface this by saying I have absolutely no dog in the fight either way, and that I legitimately don't particularly care either way who ends up winning.  First, you can't just use total points and then apply that over the season for PPG differential. No shit the dude who played more games is going to put up drastically more points when you divide total points by 72. By that logic, you can say that Anthony Edwards finished with a 3.6 PPG average over LeBron James, which clearly is absolute nonsense.  Next, when you go to compare Lamelo and Ant, you're intentionally excluding Lamelo's best games while excluding Ant's worst games, then using that as evidence that Ant's better. Again, I gotta say no shit - turns out if you focus on the best games for some players and the worst games for others, the players in the former category look good by comparison. If you excluded April and May for Ant and then focused on the last 3 months of the season for Lamelo, you'd get the exact opposite. You could literally do that to make someone like Levine or Beal look better than Harden, or something equally untrue."
I personally think Anthony Edwards is a better player - flat out. He might be less of a play maker but hes a killer...
"LaMelo only has 20 games of good play. Ant has around 50ish.   This is such a great post exposing the bias.  Anthony Edwards also finished his rookie season leading with 535 more total points (7.4 PPG average in a 72 game season for context) than the next rookie while also finishing top 5 in total assists, rebounds and steals among rookies.  Talk about finishing strong.  And best of all he actually played like this majority of the season while LaMelo only played well in 20 out of 50 games of the season.  **Outside of LaMelo Ball’s 21 game stretch (51 total played), he’s averaged 12.7 PPG, 5.8 APG, 5.9 RPG with 2.6 TO on 40/26/66 (48% TS) shooting splits in 30 games (58% of the season) and -9.6 +/-. So for a majority of the season he wasn’t great while Ant actually maintained his high level of play for longer.**  In conclusions Ant was much better for the majority of his season than LaMelo was.  Majority of LaMelo’s season was bad while majority of Edwards was not."
No its not lmfao. Its taking a super slanted sample and comparing it to a full sample. Lamelo was getting better every month until he got hurt. The idea that him missing twenty games means you dont count Anthony Edwards 20 games where he was objectively terrible against him is insane.
Anthony Edwards would never
"&gt;Anthony Edwards also finished his rookie season leading with 535 more total points (7.4 PPG average in a 72 game season for context) than the next rookie while also finishing top 5 in total assists, rebounds and steals among rookies.  give it a rest men. I've literally never seen anyone try to convert additional games played into a inflated PPG advantage. Its just absurd galaxy brain logic."
Anthony Edwards ROTY
Anthony edwards and lamelo ball would be a nasty backcourt
If Anthony Edwards doesn't win ROY it's a crying shame
"It seems like it’s really easy for people to say “Anthony Edwards was terrible for first half of the season” yet he was still putting up points that being the efficiency wasn’t great but it was still about the same as LaMelo’s TS.  He also was much better for a longer period of time, ever since Ant was promoted as a starter he started averaging 21.3 PPG (55 games) on decent efficiency and he was even better as soon as finch took over as he finished the season averaging 23.5 PPG in his final 40 games on solid efficiency.   It seems like the argument used against Edwards actually favours him more. Clearly LaMelo ball was pretty bad for most of the season besides a 20 game stretch where as Ant was only bad during earlier in the season which onto consisted of 30 games or so and even if you want to say more it’s still less than how bad LaMelo was in his season.  **Anthony Edwards also finished his rookie season leading with 535 more total points (7.4 PPG average in a 72 game season for context) than the next rookie while also finishing top 5 in total assists, rebounds and steals among rookies.**"
Here's my top 5 protected when taking contracts into consideration.  1. Karl Anthony Towns  2. Anthony Edwards  3. D'Angelo Russell  4. Jaden McDaniels  5. Malik Beasley
"It's actually crazy how Lamelo is still better than Ant even with his inconsistency and injuries as you just pointed out. He grades out as a superior player than Edwards in literally every advanced metric, his team is better, and he is a better player in every facet except for volume scoring (which Edwards is very inefficient at). How do you shoot 48% TS for 31 games and still shoot more efficiently than Anthony Edwards?   Also lmao at taking out a 21 game stretch thinking that you debunked something."
Lmao the fact that people are/were saying he is better than Anthony Edwards is beyond me.
please tell me why lamelo should win rookie of the year over anthony edwards?
Anthony Edwards has never lost an NBA post-season play-in game in this entire career.
Anthony Edwards ROTY

LOL I'm in a bad mood. So I won't be mean. You're right. Anthony Edwards would never get blown out in the play in tournament.
Anthony Edwards would NEVER
Okay... maybe Anthony Edwards is better than LaMelo.
Anthony Edwards don’t even got the chance to allow it
anthony edwards wouldnt allow this my roty lollol
He isn’t that kind of player yet. We aren’t saying free Anthony Edwards yet either.
/u/tdub85  on /r/timberwolves [did the math](https://np.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/nfjmyw/anthony_edwards_just_completed_a_historically/gylyvrm/):  &gt;You could make an argument that he has had the best second half of any of these guys under arguably the worst circumstances (although shooting guard KD - ugh)  &gt;Post all star rookie year:  &gt;Melo: 24.3/5.8/2.8 on 43/32/82  &gt;Durant: 21.9/4.8/2.7 on 47/31/88  &gt;LeBron: 21.8/5.1/6.1 on 44/30/75  &gt;Luka: 22.7/9.9/7.2 on 42/26/69  &gt;Anthony Edwards: 23.8/5.3/3.4 on 45/35/76

Me too. Anthony Edwards and Anthony Towns.
Any dunk is not special in the sense that it warrants a Neanderthal scream directed at another man. That particular Anthony edwards dunk was extremely impressive and he didn’t try to act like a tough guy afterwards. That’s why it was legendary.
"theres an anthony edwards highlight here everyday, and theyre all highlight worthy"
"I don’t think any center ever will be, the game has evolved. But Anthony Edwards tho……"

I need an Anthony Edwards diss track on the refs or some shit like that.  That shit gonna be comedy and it'll start his career in rapping
Anthony Edwards has the wit of poet.
Anthony “DK Metcalf” Edwards
Anthony Edwards is a very good basketball player.
"Ya he definitely didn't ""detonate all over"" him. Dunked on him for sure, but I was super underwhelmed after reading that title. I was expecting an Anthony Edwards level jam."
Just wait until 2 years from now when Anthony Edwards leads the Wolves back into the playoffs and Wolves fans use that to say KAT is better than Butler.
"Anthony ""DK Metcalf"" Edwards"
"Dude. He was in the Finals last season. Gonna be in the playoffs for the second time in a row. I don’t even know if the T’wolves have gone to the playoffs twice in the last 15 yrs. But hey, you’ve got Anthony fucking Edwards and he will def. take a team to the finals. Just not the Wolves cause the FO will eventually trade him to Sam Presti for hella picks. Which then they will choose other soft players with."
Anthony Edwards would win
Anthony Edwards  A1  Antman
At least now that we have Anthony Edwards in the league Westbrook won’t be the only player with the superpower of making everyone ignore the majority of his seasons.
Anthony Edwards in the Golf bucket hat was two of my favorite things combining to form the perfect human being.
Turner has some of the GOAT quotes. Anthony Edwards is going for that crown at this pace though.
Anthony Edwards
"&gt;30 game sample sizes are doing a player wrong when they've been good for more than 30 games. Just because Anthony Edwards has only been good for half the season doesn't mean RJ has to be held to that same sample size as well, acknowledge players who have been consistent all season  Okay but this is his current level of play. You only don't agree with it because it shows Ant as being better. If the situations were reversed you'd agree with it."
"30 game sample sizes are doing a player wrong when they've been good for more than 30 games. Just because Anthony Edwards has only been good for half the season doesn't mean RJ has to be held to that same sample size as well, acknowledge players who have been consistent all season  Saying something false for a player that they've started the season slow, when that's not true at all is disrespectful"
I was really skeptical about this pick (I was expecting Anthony Bennett 2.0). But Edwards is proving me wrong and absolutely tearing it up as a 19 year old.   He could be a top-5 player in the league in a few years
lmao right  Dude has 8 Anthony Edwards posts on r/NBA in the past 6 days. I wonder why he feels so exposed to ROTY debates?
KD is more than 2 ppg better than jrue holiday lol answer your own question   Idk what I expected from someone with a picture of Anthony edwards as their avatar  Edit: KD also averages like 3 more rebounds so you’re just spewing garbage at this point
Spoiler: Anthony Edwards will not be fluent in Spanish after this summer.
"In the last 24 hours, sorting by new, there have been 14 individual threads about Anthony Edwards.  Can this sub please stop riding LaMelo's meat???????????? like it's ridiculous, give Ant his fair due!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Anthony Edwards is a cool guy and he doesn't afraid of anything
Considering he hasn't played in the NFL I'm gonna say cap. Anthony Edwards will be he first one to win both so I'll wait for his quotable statement one dya.
"1st team  Edwards,Ball, Haliburton, Bey, Quickley  2nd team  Tate, Stewart, Campazzo, Anthony, Bane"
We thank you for your contribution towards the Anthony Edwards ROTY campaign
The whole twolves roster except for Anthony Edwards and Naz Reid
I hope Anthony Edwards can get more media time because he is really funny and he doesn't even try to be.

No offense to Anthony Edwards but he is one of the dumbest basketball players I know. If he thinks that he can learn spanish in one summer idk what to say
Anthony Edwards was a little kid during all of that lol
"You either call him Ant or Anthony Edwards. It's like Shaq, no one will ever call him Shaq O'Neal"
"Sure he’s flashy and he’s going to be a star. But Anthony Edwards being just a average to good distributor (which he has been lately) is much better than ball. Edwards collapses the paint and will constantly demand a 2nd help defender. I’ve watched about every game now, and I have not seen one perimeter defender that can actually guard Ant. You *need* an elite paint presence occupying the paint; which, in Utah’s case, often led to open looks for KAT on the perimeter before they had to adjust and let Gobert float around guarding Okogie (nonshooter). But even then wolves smartly adjusted with a lot of back door cuts to the paint with ant and okogie.   Edwards can take over offensively AND make others better by getting them open looks. He’s smart enough to make the right decisions too unlike early Wiggins. His ability to finish with contact is also unreal for a rookie. Lamelo makes the right plays, and winning plays. He sees plays that are already there and available to him (and identifies that better than most people already as a rookie)."
“Ant Edwards” sounds weird too imo . I hope he sticks with the full Anthony

You're telling me someone who has played better, on a better team isn't the best rookie? Anthony Edwards is a worse player than LaMelo, and even during this amazing stretch Ant has had, he hasn't been as good as LaMelo in February."
"The casual NBA fan looks at Anthony Edwards points and thinks he is phenomenal. The fact is RJ Barrett missed the all rookie 1st, 2nd, and 3rd team with better efficiencies last year and was killed by the voters for his efficiency. Anthony Edwards is the worst rated rookie for defense. Looking into LEBRON metrics you can see he has less wins added than other top rookies, his efficiency kills his offensive metrics and you have to filter to the worst D-LEBRON stat to find him. It really isn't as close as people think it is. The ""highlight"" factor of Edwards is the only  thing keeping him in the race.  Thats why it is -1000.

"Anthony ""Johnny Tightlips"" Edwards"
I think people need to accept that being good at basketball doesn’t make you interesting. Most of these dudes are boring as fuck and never had to develop a personality because other people flocked to them because they were good at basketball.  An NBA player never had to be funny or interesting to make friends or get ahead in life. That’s why people act like Anthony Edwards saying something mildly amusing makes him the funniest dude in the world.
"Every time anthony edwards gives an interview, you see a good deal of people talking about how funny the dude is. It's some hyper cringe stuff."
"by ""Ant"" he is referring to Anthony Edwards I think.  It's not a misspelling of ""and."""
Haha I think that might’ve been me.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n4epsx/who_becomes_the_face_of_the_nba_when_lebron/gwv5uce/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3  &gt; Anthony Edwards is probably the most marketable young player in the league. The NBA could make a ton off him.  &gt;He just has the IT factor.  Totally agree with you though. He reminds me a lot of AI with the type of swagger he has.
I'm 22 and the only sport I follow is basketball 🤷🏾‍♂️   Am I supposed to be ashamed for not knowing your favorite hot take machines? I bet you were one of the people offended that Anthony Edwards didn't know who A-Rod was either huh lmaoo
Anthony Edwards
they said anthony edwards' main comp is coby white
"Anderson was a borderline all star type - like a really good 3rd or 4th option on a team, probably not a great thing if he was the 2nd option, which he often was.  Stoudemire, aka mighty mouse, was pretty impressive - think isiaiah thomas if he never hurt his hip, but also playing in a much less offense-biased era.  One of the all time greats at hesitation and change of speed moves.    Jiri Welsh, was mostly forgettable.  I remember the name, can't remember the face  Doug Christie was a shit on the court and also had a really weird homelife too if I recall.  Dirty mofo, excellent defender type, like marcus smart, or a way more offensively skilled Bruce Bowen.  He was more point guard than shooting guard too, which helped free up bibby to be their go to clutch shot maker.  Guy you'd defend to the death if he was on your team, but holy shit, he was annoying.  Rick Fox once punched him - it was even better than Rondo punching CP3.  Olowakandi is the worst 1st overall pick ever, worse than bargnani, even worse than Anthony Edwards.  And before anybody chimes in with some random stats nonsense, they never actually saw how toxic and pointless his stats were on the clippers.  Hilarious that you have him down as the C from Minny."
"Anthony Edwards is probably the most marketable young player in the league. The NBA could make a ton off him.   He just has the IT factor.  On the other hand, the NBA keeps trying to push Zion down everyone’s throat."
"Brave move, recency bias is real around here  Anthony Edwards went from literal bust to GOAT for a month of play despite like 50 games of chucking with terrible shooting percentages"
Anthony Edwards - Ant Man
"LaMelo or Anthony Edwards, rookies are the easy answer"
"Anthony Edwards hasn't scored 100 points in a game and dunked on Gobert while he's sitting on Embiid's shoulders, absolute bust"
"At least those T-Wolves team had KAT and DLo and Anthony Edwards playing.  Mavs lost to Kings twice without Fox, and in one of those games, lost Barnes, too."
"My only deal is I’d be adding him to a team that already has Anthony Edwards, Caris LeVert, Andrew Wiggins, Chuma Okeke and Devin Vassell at wing 😅"
"&gt; Trae Young wasn't defined by his first half of the season  Literally no one is ""defining"" Anthony Edwards by the first half of his season lol you're still making this argument even though I have not advocated for throwing out his awesome second half even a little bit  kick that strawman's ass bud"
Anthony edwards looks like a baller for sure. But comparing his total amounts of points to guys that have missed tons of games is some OANN shit.
Anthony Edwards with KAT’s shooting lol. Edwards is a physical freak and KAT has a killer 3 pointer.
"bulls - love watching lavine and they have made some super interesting moves.   lakers - whether they mesh well and dominate, don't mesh at all and it's a disaster, or something in between... no matter the outcome it's going to be interesting to watch  wolves - i'm still waiting on seeing some healthy kat/dlo action, and anthony edwards is awesome"
I think Ant is referring to Anfernee Simons. Not Anthony Edwards. They share the nickname.
"Recency bias, but Anthony Edwards on Yuta Watanabe is probably the grossest mid-dunk photo of all time.  This one looks better in real-time though I think."
"I think Jamal and MPJ are wayyy too low,  DeAaron fox is not in a different tire than Jamal who averaged 21,5 and 4 this year on 48/41/87 splits while sharing the ball with jokic and sharing shots with MPJ, Barton and Gordon,  He averaged 25,5,4 on 51/46/94 splits his in his last 25 games before getting hurt   MPJ averaged 19 and 7 on 55% from the field and 45% from 3  When Jamal went out he averaged 23 and 7 on 55/44/85 splits  Y’all don’t watch any nuggets games and it shows You really have Anthony edwards over those two?"
PLAYERS:     A) Devin Booker   B) Anthony Edwards (2nd half of the year)   C) Donovan Mitchell    B) Collin Sexton
B is Anthony Edwards post-ASG?  C seems like Mitchell  A is Booker  D…Sexton?  Edit: he’s making you guys pick Edwards on a small 25 game sample size over all star shooting guards lol
"Wolves are the only team of the three I think is clearly better this year than last, and that's mostly because I think Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are good and getting better rapidly.  If Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell and Patrick Beverley play 65 games or more apiece, the Wolves will be saying something.  And let me also say Malik Beasley's shooting fits around Ben Simmons better than Anthony Edwards.  If the Wolves put four above average 3pt shooters like KAT, Russell, Beverly and Beasley around Ben Simmons, its bombs away!    Sacramento, meh.  I like Davion Mitchell, but dont understand how four guards (mitchell, fox, haliburton, hield) are going to make that much of a difference on defense when you're still relying on Barnes, Bagley and Holmes in the front court.    David Griffen should be arrested for what he's doing to the Pelicans.  What the hell do they have to show for trading away Jrue Holiday and the Lonzo Ball?  Totally unexcited about Kira Lewis, Alexander Walker.   Zion Williamson needs to play with a big who can stretch the floor, and the Pelicans got Steven Adams last year, and Jonas Valenciunas this year?  Trey Murphy was a good pick.  That's about it.  Got lucky there, because the Wizards were smoking crack when they let him slide past."
"Anthony Edwards is a decent analog for him right now in that you watch him and you think ""Man when this dude learns how to play basketball the league is in *trouble*!"" because right now he's basically just relying on being insanely athletic.  John Wall was very similar when he first came in the league where he looked like a race horse out there blowing by people but he just had not figure out the game yet, he just knew that he was way faster than everyone else."
"&gt;Jeff Teague/Andrew Wiggins/Jimmy Butler/Taj Gibson/KAT held the 3rd seed for most of the season   They went from the 3 seed to the 8 seed because Jimmy Butler got injured. They were 37-22 when Butler played and 10-13 when he didn't play. So they had a 63% win percentage when he played, which would have been the 3rd best in the west.  &gt;I don't see how D'lo/Anthony Edwards/?/Ben Simmons/KAT can do any worse  1: because the game is not played on paper. If you think D'lo/Edwards/?/Simmons/KAT can compete for a 3 seed, then why couldn't D'lo/Edwards/Beasley/McDaniels/KAT compete for anything last year?  2: because Jimmy butler is a better floor raiser than any of KAT, Simmons, etc. Already showed the wolves record with/without him &amp; the heat in his 2 seasons are 71-39 when he plays 13-22 when he's out."
Jeff Teague/Andrew Wiggins/Jimmy Butler/Taj Gibson/KAT   held the 3rd seed for most of the season so I don't see how  D'lo/Anthony Edwards/?/Ben Simmons/KAT can do any worse lol.
"Timberwolves easily, if they stay healthy they have a Top 3 Center and a Rising Superstar in Anthony Edwards"
"I’m betting on San Antonio.   I think it’ll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I’m going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D’Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I’ll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I’d probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it’s not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they’d be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I’ll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don’t see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn’t take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
"The problem is that not all 1st overall picks are created equal. If Anthony Edwards is Wiggins 2.0 I don't think he'll be considered as disappointing as Wiggins, because he was a much less hyped prospect."
Wait Anfernee Simons is Ant too? I was like where did Anthony Edwards come into this lol
Anthony Edwards
"eye test by definition requires being seen.  The Timberwolves have exactly 3 national games this year.  If Anthony Edwards has a less than stellar first showing, people will write him off.  No a defense argument, but an obvious one to compare.  You gotta be SEEN to pass the eye test."
"Anthony Edwards, Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and it's a done deal. No additional picks.  Big 3 of KAT, DLo and Ben looks $p00ky"
Anthony EDWARDS
Anthony Edwards
"Yuta Watanabe, I’m prepared for all the Anthony Edwards comments"
"What deal could have twolves offered? D'Angelo Russell and picks? Anthony edwards and Kat are untouchable, so...."
Anthony Edwards
"A year ago, it would have been Simmons, but people have wizened up by now.    These days, it's hard to tell.  People seem cautious/critical of young guys.    I guess maybe Tyler Herro? But things have cooled off since their finals win.    One might say Talen Horton-Tucker, but I think everybody outside of LA knows that he's just getting the typical LA-hype.    People might say Anthony Edwards, but people haven't been overhyped about him.    Ja has proven he isn't just hype.    Booker to.    Ayton as well.    It's hard to find a young guy that gets hyped these days that doesn't get an equal amount of criticism.    If anything, people seem to be extremely harsh of young guys these days. If 19 year olds don't play like All-Stars by their second season, people act like they are a bust.    So this is a hard question."
"Lakers THT.  Nuggets MPJ.  TWolves Anthony Edwards.  Hornets Lamelo Ball.  In that order. Didn’t include Ben Simmons, because dude ain’t as young as these folks. 23 and under."
"Well, where the hell is Anthony Edwards, then?"
Anthony Edwards for Mo Bamba straight up fuckin do it pussy
I like Anthony edwards and I’m high on his potential but I’ve seen people talk about it like it’s a forgone conclusion he ends up a superstar.
I've been through a lot of shit fuck things as a decades long Timberwolves fan and I'm still here but trading Anthony Edwards would make me set my pants on fire and jump out a window.
Anthony Edwards and filler for ben Simmons.  Forget dlo and go for something worth while. That should be the trade sixers go threw. Take whatever salaries wolves want to dump.  Edward's will be good now and big potential in the future.
[Anthony Edwards did it](https://youtu.be/ivtKuUs2TH0)
"Anthony Edwards and its not close, hes 6'6 built like mini Zion and could end up being one of the best scorers of the next generation"
Anthony Edwards will be playing outside linebacker for the Packers in 3 years
"Wiggins lifting weights, buxton putting on muscle, the Vikings being the Vikings, I’m so jaded by the offseason improvement shit.  Except for Anthony Edwards. Truly believe he gets what he wants, and also that he looks skinny. He either lost weight or got taller."
"This is Anthony Edwards we're talking about. If he wants to be prime Shaq, he'll be prime Shaq"
Anthony edwards was actually really good the second half of the season putting up allstar numbers against actual nba teams too. He definitely can still help embiid. Besides outside of dame and Beal there aren’t that many other options that help embiid. Ants upside and youth is also beneficial for the sizers long term goals considering embiids health as well. Also if dame was to request a trade a rebuilding Portland would gladly take on ant as their franchise cornerstone if they want to flip dame down the line. There’s so many options
"*Unless they are okay with splitting with Anthony Edwards, this trade doesn't happen and I'm still not sure if it happens with Edwards as the centerpiece.*  LOL if Morey doesn’t take this and run away with it then he might just be the worst GM in the league today. Ant alone has sky high potential not to mention he’s on a rookie deal so you’re getting ant + fillers which would end up being bev or Beasley + other stuff to match the salaries."
I think Minnesota will have to part ways with Anthony Edwards to get Ben Simmons
5-7 seed next year with a higher ceiling after that as Anthony Edwards continues his development.  I also think it could help unlock something in Simmons too
"In 2060 it will be Anthony Edwards, Giannas and Luka on Inside the NBA"
"Anthony Edwards hands down, hes gonna be top 10."
Ya but bro SGAs stroke game  And I know you know the fadeaway step back I’m talking about. Edwards stepped back then hit a fadeaway on Carmelo Anthony from wayyyyyy outta town.
"&gt;i srsly wonder, is he actually opposed to playing with his buddy in minnesota because of the location? do you think that would affect how much kat would want him there or no? or is ben worried about what playing together might do to that friendship?   [Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic confirms on Dan Barrerio that Ben Simmons is open to being traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves to play with his friends Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell. Along with fellow Klutch Sports client Anthony Edwards.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pfgmm9/jon_krawczynski_of_the_athletic_confirms_on_dan/)"
&gt;to play with his friends Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell. Along with fellow Klutch agent Anthony Edwards.    Ok so Simmons assumes Minnesota will trade no assets to Philly for him?
Anthony Edwards?
"Play with KAT, DLo AND Anthony Edwards? Lol then who going to philly then"
Part of this is mental for Simmons. It seems like it has just become increasingly tough for him to get to the right mental state to go out and improve his game and play freely in Philly. As just about everyone involved has handled the situation poorly. A new situation could help. Especially if he could have 1-2 years to play in a place with less immediate pressure to succeed. Maybe Minnesota would fit that as they would likely need a couple years of Anthony Edwards development to really make a run in the west and most of the team has very little playoff experience so they’d likely not make it to far into the playoffs there first couple years.
"One could split the difference and say it's scary they're this bad despite having KAT, D-Lo and Anthony Edwards."
"However it happens or doesn’t happen, Anthony Edwards is going nowhere."
Anthony Edwards is a Klutch guy as well I believe and that honestly disturbs me
"&gt; You’re discounting the fact that Edwards can become a superstar.  No I'm not since I didn't say shit about Edwards. Because I already said the idea of keeping all 3 members of Edwards/DLO/Anthony Towns and acquiring Simmons is very silly and even if you can pull it off congrats on 4 years of second round playoff exits and various arguments about what a 'fully healthy' or 'optimized' team looks like.  Dude I'm not shitting on you. I'm telling you the way it is. You either get a Giannis or Kawhi level talent in the draft and build around them well foundationally enough and at the same pace as their talent leaps to win a championship as a small market team, or you don't. For all 76 NBA champions or whatever, there are 10-30 other teams that didn't do it well enough. This is their story. Wolves, I'm telling you Simmons isn't your path to success, and if he is he is a stepping stone."
"I would imagine for anything to ensure, some assets would need to be provided. If Edwards, Russell, and Anthony Towns named as matching pieces ,wtf do the Wolves think they're giving up?"
&gt;Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic confirms on Dan Barrerio that Ben Simmons is open to being traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves to play with his friends Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell. Along with fellow Klutch Sports client Anthony Edwards.
"Wouldn't it at least take Anthony Edwards to get Simmons though?  Who else does Minnesota have? Plus I doubt thats enough for Morey to be content. Embiid's timeline is tickin, he needs a star in his prime, ready to win now  This is def getting interesting though"
For Ben Simmons?!? You would have to give up one of Anthony Edwards or DLo.   Phillies are too greedy to bite on what you offered.
"What is wrong with these wolves fans on this subreddit lmfao. Like you are just throwing up horrific trade packages. Would you accept Shake milton, Danny green, and jaden springer for Anthony Edwards?"
"Okay, then RJ would have to be pushed to 11 because Anthony Edwards is better by far."
"Anthony Edwards, his development could be the difference between fighting for homecourt advantage in the playoffs or being a play in out."
"Anthony Edwards, no cap"
Anthony edwards
"Anthony Edwards absolutely deserves a spot, remove Levert and put Edwards right at that spot."
Anthony Edwards should be on this list
"Anthony Edwards is better than Sexton, Barrett, and Levert right now"
"Fail. No . Anthony Edwards is very happy in Minnesota, you leave him be. Thank you very much"
Anthony Edwards for Ben is not a good deal for Minnesota
"harden got traded for 4 firsts and 4 swaps + a young player in LaVert and he's a better player than Dame. If Dame demands out the Blazers are obviously going to blow it up, they want draft capital and one centerpiece young player.  A lot of 1sts + young players is not the most ridiculous trade ever. They're going to trade CJ/Roco after anyways too so they're gonna end up with a fuckton of draft capital. Best case scenario is that the TWolves give up Anthony Edwards or Dlo, which probably won't happen, but crazier things have"
"Yes and Anthony Edwards is also crazy strong and bullies players from 1-3 regularly, maybe you should watch more of ant play if you don’t think he’s a comparable if not better physical freak at the guard spot homie.   RJ is a lot better than a lot of people who compare the two act but you talk like you don’t even know what ants strengths are. Argue about defense and consistency if you think RJ is better to argue about slashing and strength is just showing your ass."
I would say Anthony edwards pretty easily
Anthony Edwards by light years
"Anthony Edwards is better despite being a rookie.   Nothing against RJ, but Anthony Edwards looks like he could be a superstar where RJ Barrett looks like his ceiling is a few all star appearances"
RJ Barret is closer to Miles McBride or Quentin Grimes than he is to Anthony Edwards
"Anthony Edwards is better, imo. He played really great during the second half of the season and has star written all over him."
Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards would have saved the Twins from being ass in 2021.
anthony edwards lowkey
Im surprised no one has said Anthony Edwards in this thread…I believe he’ll be a top 20 player in 2 more seasons
As a two sport guy Anthony Edwards reminds me a lot of Allen Iverson. You may not think it's because of his bill but AI was legitimately one of the best high school prospects in the country at quarterback and has an argument for being the best prospect ever in Virginia. Definitely made the right choice in his career imo but it would have been interesting to see AI in the league.
There’s no doubt in my mind that Anthony Edwards is going to be a star in this league.
"Anthony Edwards, idk if its darkhorse though."
"Anthony edwards, and just for fun, Juan Toscano Anderson."
Bruh how is Anthony edwards small?? Isn’t man’s 6’4”?
How is Anthony edwards ant man besides the name???
Anthony Edwards will finish as Top 15 in 3PM and Top 15 in Pts  &amp;#x200B;  Jaren Jackson Jr will develop to a player better than Morant.
"Depending on how big of a leap they take, I could absolutely see players like LaMelo, Anthony Edwards, and Ja Morant becomes cultural influences for the league, actively seeking the spotlight. Even superstars right now like AD, Embiid, and Jayson Tatum are showing me that."
Anthony Edwards
"idk about ceiling, but i think the closest player comp would be anthony edwards. except edwards is bigger. their style and game look like carbon copies"
"Anthony Edwards and D Lo for Benjamin, probably what the sixers are asking for, plus a few picks"
"&gt;Who else are the Blazers getting as a centrepiece and it's something the other team is actually going to offer? You say the Harden trade is an outlier but teams are pretty much the same asset wise as they were when that trade went down.  Some potential trades I think could happen:  Pelicans could decide to speed up their rebuild and offer Ingram  Nuggets could offer either Murray or MPJ  Miami could offer something like Bam/Herro/Robinson for Dame and Nurkic  Minnesota could offer Anthony Edwards (this one’s unlikely imo)   Jazz could offer Mitchell. Great player but they could be tired of early exits and want to go for a homerun with a Dame/Gobert duo.   This is all on top of other players and picks obviously, I’m just listing the centrepieces. I left out teams like the Grizzlies/Kings/Thunder/Pistons where the timelines just don’t make sense to trade for Dame and have no supporting cast left. But off the top of my head I think they’d take all of those packages and I don’t think it’s unreasonable that they be offered either.  &gt;Embiid absolutely has more value to us because he doesn't want to leave lol. The situations are nothing alike, if Embiid was saying the things Dame has been saying I'd probably think differently.  Well I kinda assumed you knew the only way Philly would trade Embiid is if he requested a trade. I didn’t think I had to specifically say that because it’s common knowledge. What I’m saying is that even in a scenario where Embiid requested a trade you still 100% wouldn’t be happy with the package you’re offering for Dame. You can’t tell me with a straight face you’d accept something like that, even if it came after a trade request."
Anthony Edwards has enough mamba mentality alone to carry this squad when he's in his prime
"[Your trade](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ydq36oh9) has the Kings giving up the best player and getting the scraps from a team even worse than them and Tyrese Maxey in return. The Kings are trying to make the playoffs (whether that is smart or not is a different question) but if they were giving up, they wouldn't make this trade without getting Anthony Edwards in return."
"Anthony Edwards, MPJ, DeAaron Fox"
Anthony edwards
Anthony edwards or oladipo
"A point guard who can't shoot in 2021 will need a very specific situation to provide positive value when you need to trade the world for him. The Wolves are one such situation, but they aren't giving up any of their already developed players while Embiid is an extremely injury prone guy reaching 28 soon. Now a third team can facilitate the trade but the third team needs to have a star that the Sixers value more than Simmons. Among potentially available players, it's just Lillard and Beal. And I strongly doubt they will settle for any deal involving Minnesota that doesn't include Anthony Edwards. Particularly Portland, seeing that they're giving up 3 to 4 years of Lillard in the trade."
Anthony Edwards
"Anthony Edwards was ranked 99% in acceleration and 98% in deceleration, all while being a tank at 6’5 and 230 pounds."
"Jimmy Butler took the Wolves to the playoffs. Russell Westbrook took a rather dismal team to the 6th seed a few years back. Pretty sure Giannis, Harden, and KD could do it. Wouldn't be surprised to see Embiid and Jokic manage that.  KAT is a star, but he's never really been top 10 in the league. If this Wolves roster has any hope of the playoffs, it'll be Anthony Edwards as much as KAT."
"Anthony ""A1 from Day 1"" Edwards"
"I'm a Bucks fan and honestly I don't even know about that statement.  In terms of raw athleticism, guys like Zion and Anthony Edwards come to mind.   I think Giannis is lightyears ahead of knowing how to apply his athleticism to his game, but athletically both of those guys could be ahead of Giannis.  Zion is arguably stronger than him and has more bounce too. He doesn't have the end to end speed yet he's still very fast for someone built like a defensive lineman.   Edwards is definitely speedier and has more bounce.  I think Giannis' long limbs, which help him make crazy blocks and dunks, make it seem like he's more athletic than he is. Let's also not forget how gassed he was towards the end of the postseason (not that it seemed to effect his performance, but still worth noting). Don't get me wrong, he's still top 3 athletically in the league, but I don't think it's as cut and dry as him being number one without a doubt."
"Assuming they sign the deal today for the next 5 years:  **100% worth it**:  * Lebron (idc how old he is he's still the best player when he plays)  * Jokic  * Giannis (I honestly am not as big on Giannis as most but I would be raked over the coals if I left him off)  * Luka  * Harden  * KD  * Tatum (people might disagree but he's a durable two-way player with a very high floor, so even if he doesn't develop anymore I think it's worth it or almost worth it)  These are guys who are not big injury risks and can be the best player on a championship team.  KD is the biggest injury risk but he is good enough and just durable enough to definitely be worth it.  And none of them are big defensive liabilities.  **99% worth it**:  * Kawhi  * Curry  Great players that can lead their team but may have age/injury risks tied to them.    **I basically think that all of the players below this are unlikely to win a championship if they are on a supermax.**  **Worth it but it's a risk**:  * Embiid (he's the second best big in the league but is a pretty big injury risk)  * Zion  * Jimmy Butler (he's a great all-around player and a winner, but he's not quite as good as everyone above him on this list)  * Paul George (before this postseason run he probably wouldn't have been in this tier)  * Donovan Mitchell (he's a good player, I think the risk is that he never quite reaches superstar potential, but it would likely be a slight overpay rather than a complete waste)  * KAT (young player who's a beast on offense, bad defensively, no success whatsoever)  * Trae Young (he's small and a terrible defender so he will need to become a player almost as good as Curry to be worth it)  * Ja Morant  **Not worth it, but would get it**:  * Lillard (bad defensively, no playoff success)  * Anthony Day-to-Davis (can't stay healthy, has proven he cannot be THE guy)  * Bradley Beal (i don't think this would handicap a team, but i don't think he's quite a superstar)  * Russell Westbrook (no idea if he would get it at this point in his career, but i bet some team would give it to him)  I don't think Devin Booker would get it, but he would probably fall into this list.  Although he's another guy that prob wouldn't handicap a team on a supermax, he just probably wouldn't ever fully live up to it.  And I don't think CP3 would get it today at his age.  ***Might* be worth it, but prob wouldn't get it**:  * Anthony Edwards  * LaMelo Ball  * SGA  * Jamal Murray  * De'Aaron Fox  Did I miss anyone?"

Anthony Edwards for MVP and MIP. Jaden McDaniels for DPOY.  No bias
"I think they'll be a fun team to watch on most nights. They'll have no issue scoring,I think their young guys are going to have many highlights throughout the year. There are going to be some losses that are going to come down to late game execution from a young team. Look for KAT to have an All NBA season possibly but the team likely misses the playoffs but is close to the play in. Anthony Edwards is going to have great games, interviews, and will get better in year 2. The health of D'Lo will dictate the record. Post all star break I see them going on a run to just miss out on the playoffs"
Anthony Edwards likely will be above Wiggins. But he’s still unproven in comparisons to Wiggins sheerly due to the fact that he’s young. Other than that I like this list.
"Another one: Anthony Edwards averages 25/5/5 on 45/45/80, is anointed the next James Harden of the league and savior of the Timberwolves franchise"
* Anthony Edwards - Dion Waiters/Oladipo  * Jalen Suggs - Rose/Rod Strickland  * Cade - 00’s Paul Pierce/Duke’s Grant Hill  * De’Aaron - Evil Brandon Knight  * Ja - Whatever Mudiay should have been?
"Anthony Edwards is leading the TImberwolves to the WCF next year, finishes top 3 in MVP historic sophmore season"
Jalen Green - Bradley Beal/Zach Lavine  Anthony Edwards - Bigger Donovan Mitchell  Cade Cunningham - Khris Middleton/SGA  Ja Morant - John Wall  Jonathon Kuminga - Raw Paul George  Tyrese Haliburton - Malcolm Brogdan
I mean I don't follow prospects at all cuz idc but before the draft for about like 6-7 months maybe even during the last draft I've been seeing posts here and everyone's been dick riding Cade super hard lol. Like Anthony Edwards gets drafted first last year and I saw a lot of people talking about cade

"1. The Atlanta Hawks will be the 1st seed in the NBA.  2. Cam Reddish will have a breakout year and PT is the only thing that will show if he's MIP.  3. Miami will not meet Vegas expectations but Boston will.  4. Their is a Laker who no one is chatting about outside of LA fans who will breakout and help LA become the #1 seed in the West. 5. Utah will be back, watch out LA. Same for PHX, watch out LA. 6. There is a Laker who no one is chatting about outside of LA fans who will breakout and help LA become the #1 seed in the West. 7. One of these teams will do better than expected: (Orl, Det, Hou, Okc, Cle) 8. Okc and Hou will stink in 2021-22 but in 22-23, one of them will be play in teams and vastly improve.  9. Don't sleep on the Knicks. They might not be an eye candy team but they gel well and they get more out of their players than most will get out of their players. Kemba/Rose mix will really help the two PGs as well as McBride playing a key role as well.  10. My top 10 breakout kids are in no order: O. Toppin, C. Reddish, A. Edwards, L. Ball, Tre Jones, T. Maxey, I. Quickley, Rui, and K. Johnson. 11. The Spurs surprise people and be a play-in team.  12. Players people are expecting to breakout but likely won't is: K. Kuzma, R.J. Barrett, D. Hunter, M. Robinson, J. Allen, C. Sexton, C. Anthony, B. Ingram, D. Graham, and P. Achuiwa.  13. I have no clue who will win it all, it will come down to luck and health.

Anthony edwards 🤷‍♂️
Anthony edwards has some D-Wade to him when he drives. has the same sort of lightning quick first step and gets very low to the ground as well.
"Anthony Edwards is gonna be a Generational Scorer with his combination of rare athleticism and control mixed with his ability to shot create, will go down as one of the best scorers ever."
Jalen Green is either gonna be loved like Anthony Edwards or hated like Russell Westbrook. No inbetween.
Watch the Wolves for Anthony Edwards break out season
Anthony Edwards over MPJ
"Anthony Edwards has every physical tool to be an elite defender, but he makes way too many mistakes by losing his man off-ball or being too aggressive going for steals. Hopefully will get better with age."
"The Lakers roster' make no sense as a single unit and they are not ""clear favorites"" in the West.   Giannis is on the same career trajectory as MJ and LeBron.  Anthony Edwards: I love the person, but think the basketball player is on a path towards never being an actually-effective main/co-main option. Kind of like Andrew Wiggins, ironically."
"I think if luka had anthony edwards hops, hed be alot more widely regarded as that next dude. Having a highlight reel of posters while also being the playmaker/scorer that he is would give him a boost in america. The public here loves that shit"
I had to check to make sure this wasn’t by the guy who posted about Anthony Edwards bringing gumbo to Benihana
"He’s already on a top 5 nba strength level. He’s right there with the Anthony Edwards, Zion, Lowry level wrecking balls of players."
"Tyrese Maxey is going to be a really good player. Maybe he needs one more year but I think he'll play a much bigger role on the team this year.  Anthony Edwards will be substantially better, I think he is a future all-star.  Timelord is another candidate here."
IDC if I'm biased. I say Anthony Edwards is about to go ham
same can be said of anthony edwards...actually think they can have similar trajectories
Give us Anthony Edwards and we have a deal lmao
Anthony Edwards for sure
Ask Anthony Edwards the same question and the seeding will be lower. Kids are too real.
Yup - and it's not like Terry Porter (who the Wolves had) or Sam Cassell were bad by any stretch for the Timberwolves.  Our best 5:  PG: Cassell  SG: Butler  SF: Garnett (because he could defend 3's otherwise he's at the 4)  PF: Love  C:  Towns  We're hoping Anthony Edwards develops enough so our best all-time lineup moves Garnett back to his rightful position at the 4.
"By second big I mean that he’s gotta go behind Mobley. Mobley was the third prospect. Then add Anthony Edwards so he can’t be higher than the 5th best prospect.  So it’s Wiseman/Suggs/Barnes/Kuminga/Giddey. I take him over Giddey and Barnes, I’d actually bet because Wiseman only played 3 games he doesn’t have the decline of Kuminga who got worse as the season went on. So it’s him vs Suggs. I choose Suggs. Sixth best prospect."
top 50 players (sorted by team):  Lakers:  1). LeBron James  2). Anthony Davis  3). Russell Westbrook  Suns:   4). Devin Booker  5). Chris Paul  Nuggets:  6). Nikola Jokic  7). Jamal Murray  8). Michael Porter Jr.  Trail Blazers:  9). Damian Lillard  10). CJ McCollum  Mavericks:  11). Luka Doncic  Clippers:  12). Kawhi Leonard  13). Paul George  Jazz:  14). Donovan Mitchell  15).

"They need to hurry and trade simmons to the TWolves while they can. Anthony Edwards and a 2nd round pick seems fair  Ben would fit in well, too. His buddies DLo and KAT are there already. They can have sleepovers and play fortnite all night, it’s perfect"
What type of prospects....don't think Portland is particularly interested in anyone not named Anthony Towns or at the very least Anthony Edwards plus a fuck ton of picks.
The only thing he doesn't do well is score.  He defends at an all NBA level rebounds extremely well.  Works well with the positionless defense that we have been tryin to go too.  We have shooters around him he isn't going to be carrying an offensive load.  He slots in real well with what we have.  He is a top 30 player with 4 more years on his deal frankly we aren't getting anyone through free agency.  So its either go in with him or blow the team up and go through Anthony Edwards because KAT isn't sticking around.
Fun fact: Anthony Edwards (born august 2021) was 1 year old when Carmelo was drafted in 2003.
Ppl are incapable of waiting to form informed opinions lol. Hot take city. I remember dumbfucks in the Wolves sub actually saying Anthony Edwards was the next Anthony Bennett when he struggled out the gates last year. Cade's gonna be just fine.
lmao D'Angelo Russell and Anthony Edwards died? Also I would claw my eyes out if I saw a KAT/Lauri starting frontcourt.  I want Lauri as a bench stretch 4 lol which is his talent level.
"Kyrie, Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Anthony Edwards, and Jalen Suggs would be fun to watch. All Athletic, Strong, and Dynamic!"
Hard to answer this in a vacuum. Like I'd want to watch Anthony Edwards see how he's coming along but I'd also be watching to see how the Wolves are playing in general now that they have a couple of pieces.
"Anthony Edwards, he can do whatever you need him to do if there's money on the line."
Anthony Edwards enters the chat and says yes thank you
I get that but it’s easy to get bunnies to Joel Embiid. Anthony Edwards figured out last year that passing to KAT = spacing for him and assists.
"this sub is outright batty over Anthony Edwards, are there just a lot of Twolves fans?"
"Anthony Edwards, Giannis, Jokic, Luka(if he stops whining to the refs), Donovan Mitchell all deserve more pushing from the NBA imo   Ant for sure though, too bad he won't because Minnesota"
"Alright, yay. I didn’t dig into her life like that to judge her. I see my dude Anthony Edwards is happy and I’m happy for him. That’s it. I don’t care about her history or her flaws. I’m seeing 2 people happy together and that’s what matters to me."
"Well Suggs is a hometown Minneapolis boy so I’m rooting my ass off for him. Love his game and Orlando is my east team this year. Also a big J Isaac guy, was hoping the wolves picked him.  And Anthony Edwards went from being one of the worst statistical players to a top 10-15 shooting guard over night, so don’t be to scared."
Anthony Edwards struggled for the first 31 games at the rim then followed the next 41 by shooting like 70 percent within three feet.
"I'm trying to think of some reasons why this guy shouldn't be my favourite player, and I can't come up with any. Guess I'm an Anthony Edwards stan now"
"We won’t know for another 5 years if the young core is any good. Could go either way, Wiseman/Kuminga are both so raw, I could see them developing into stars or Whitside and Stanley Johnson. Warriors didn’t draft LaMelo or Anthony Edwards."
when is anthony edwards' podcast coming out again?
Anthony Edwards is r/nba’s favourite player. I have no objections.
If you don't like Anthony Edwards I don't like you
"It's like 3 years in a row I'm thinking KAT will take that leap into top 10 player status and with Anthony Edwards coming on strong, Malik Beasley playing more, D'Angelo Russell scoring the ball, and hopefully some development from other young players I think they'll be in the playoffs/play-in.  I will probably be wrong again, but I just love KAT and really do think he's a top 10 player surrounded by trash."
Anthony Edwards arrival to superstardom is coming
These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.
"Missing Anthony Edwards, Cade and Green on that list of uber talented players on bad teams. Honestly unless Zion improves massively in some areas, he isn't the best choice to pick for starting a franchise because his offense is somewhat limited and he is a traffic cone on defense.   I agree that what they need to do is a hard cap. Lakers are over the cap with Bron+Westbrook+AD alone, yet that didn't stop them in FA at all. Cut that shit from happening and you can spread the talent over more of the league.   The salary cap in the NBA is 112M, GSW has a current payroll of over 170M. It is no wonder that nice markets and big teams stay big, they don't have to figure out the math at all, just open the wallet."
"We, the Wolves, certainly haven't. It's more a product of our minimal cap space but we made a lateral move healthy for depth across the roster and hope to resign our &lt;7$$ per year role guys (who can be legitimately impactful at times). Not a lot of upside in terms of creative roster building, as our assets seem kinda mismatched in regards to the guys it would make sense to bring in to our roster.   The upside is even our fringe rotational guys have a fair amount of upside going into the season. Jaylen Nowell, Jordan McLaughlin, Jarred  Vanderbilt, (Nathan Knight?), Juancho Hernangomez are all guys that could credibly play better next year than last. How much better is unknown. I personally believe Malik Beasley's play will make GMs reassess his value more highly. Also we're still just riding the high of Anthony Edwards, so life could be worse."
"how good is his prime ? He literally lost the 76ers a series they should have won with his stupid movies, i would rather guy like D’Angelo or Anthony Edwards over him assuming Miny lets him go"
&gt;Because Anthony Edwards usage  And what of the near-decade that Rubio played before Edwards graduated from high school?
The only other dunk I’ve seen go as hard as those two is Anthony Edwards’ from this year. Im sure uk the one lol
Drafting Anthony Edwards
Because Anthony Edwards usage
"Downvote me all you want, but for me the goat regular season dunk is already Anthony Edwards on Watanabe"
"Anthony Edwards. Back half of the year he compares against some of the best rookies ever and with his personality, losing the ROY (although it was a closed race before ANT really got cooking) put a huge chip on his shoulder. Add to this a team starting from a clean slate (injures we’re really bad last year) - you get a hella competitive young D wade type player with something to prove on a more talented than last years record team, meaning better efficiency opportunity."
Speaking of weight differences. It amazes me that Anthony Edwards is just as explosive as someone like Jalen Green while being 45 pounds heavier.
"He’s not, he might be in the future once he develops his game and gets more experience but he’s just not a good player right now.  Anthony Edwards is massively over rated and over hyped. People just look at points when evaluating players and don’t look at efficiency and he’s extremely inefficient.  Why do you think he’s good? He can’t shoot the 3 well, he has no mid range, he can drive the ball in but chooses not to (hence the low efficiency)"
Anthony Edwards? Lmao no he’s not a better player… he’s not even a good player. Dude just got fed the ball this season so he could develop but he played super poorly
"AD could be healthy (probably not) which would be huge.  Then a few of Zion, Trae, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo, Anthony Edwards, Ja Morant, or De'Aaron Fox could be all-NBA level players by 2024 and that is probably all it would take."
* PG - Stephen Curry * SG - Anthony Edwards * SF - Kevin Durant * PF - Jayson Tatum * C - Anthony Davis * Zach Lavine * Donovan Mitchell * Bam Adebayo * Zion Williamson * Cade Cunningham * Moses Moody * Trae Young
"Anthony Edwards will average 26/5/4 next season and take MIP, hes gonna get more calls to the FT line."
"Some of these just seem odd to me   Like I think Anthony Edwards has much more room to grow than Lavine.   Lavine just put up 27-5-5 on 50/40/85. Not to say he can't get better but ""MIP"" better? IDK"
You mean anthony edwards?
That’s Anthony Edwards
"The Wolves are one of the few teams that can make Simmons shine. The problem with Simmons is that you need to surround him with 4 shooters, but he can’t really play Center. That means you need a shooting Center if you want Simmons to thrive.   KAT is the greatest shooting center of all time, but not a great defender. That should make him and Simmons a great fit. Anthony Edwards is also really good at iso scoring, so he could get buckets in the clutch.   If they can keep McDaniels and/or Beasley, then the Wolves can run a starting lineup of:  Anthony Edwards (33% 3pt as a rookie), Malik Beasley (40% 3pt), Jalen McDaniels (36% 3pt as a rookie), Simmons and KAT (40% 3pt).   That’s pretty deadly."
One Anthony Edwards please
Thats probably fair value on our end for simmons but i just don't think Minnesota can trade both as we would have so little spacing for either simmons or Ant to do their work.  Minnesotas path to getting simmons has always been with a third team getting a bunch of picks and swaps and players like Jaden Mcdaniels and Naz Reid and other young non anthony edwards players going to the third team who are trading you guys the vets you want and Beasley probably also going to Philly which just isn't happening at the current moment.
"If this sub was graceful about not picking on players because of their age, this sub wouldn’t lose their minds at an 18 year old Anthony Edwards saying he wanted to be a rapper and football player."
Anthony Edwards has declared for the NFL draft.
Anthony Edwards retires to pursue lifelong dream of playing in NFL.
Anthony Edwards
"Well, as someone who likes the Wolves and always wants them to succeed, I hope Anthony Edwards can develop more than KAT has and Russell can stay healthy, but every year I look at the Wolves’ roster and think, “they’ll make it to the playoffs for sure!” and they always somehow disappoint. I mean, you can’t win a championship with one guy, but I’d hope that next year they can at least contend for a playoff spot with three pretty darn good guys who seem like they complement each other well."
"It's always gonna be part of his game, think bigger Anthony Edwards with less shooting. He'll need a lot of reps to make mistakes and learn from."
"not to hate on the bucks or anything, but they're getting a lot of love in this thread for having just won, but they lost pj tucker and bryn forbes and they added semi ojeleye and rodney hood...  meanwhile miami added tucker, lowry, and one of the psycho twins, as well as a bunch of people i don't know  the bulls added caruso, lonzo, and demar to lavine and vucevich.   the sixers added dru- never mind.  the wizards have got dinwiddie, kuzma, kcp, and harrell and they still have beal and rui.   the knicks added kemba to their hospital guard rotation too.  the celtics added back horford, shed their weakness in kemba, added kanter, and are still in the market for a few moves.   now i don't know that all of these teams will click, but these aren't weak teams, and that makes the east just that little bit harder to roll through in the playoffs, and brooklyn is still around with their big 4 or 6 or whatever they're up to now.  and since there's only 3 contenders to list, i think brooklyn has to be the one in the east, because they're the only team that is capable of beating every other team in a best of 7, even when unhealthy (see: bucks series).  but then someone will ask why i only give 1 to the east - i don't think the lakers will come out of the west guaranteed. the clippers still exist, the jazz and suns are largely unchanged with some small additions, the warriors have klay coming back mid-season hopefully, and portland's going to have a lot to prove to keep dame around.   there's also some of those smaller markets to consider who could trip up the big teams at vital moments and influence the seeding by stealing wins, even if they're not contenders. NOLA is making moves, though we're yet to see what comes of that now they've missed lowry and paul. minnesota has KAT, dlo, and anthony edwards, and i don't rate them, but people seem to have some hope they might all be healthy and ball out. i'm interested in memphis and what they'll do with ja running around adams, and there's always some fun to be had watching OKC do their thing.   lastly there's the kings, but i don't think we have to worry about them bothering anyone, so i didn't even really need to include them did i.  tldr: east - nets; west - pick two of lakers, warriors, clippers, suns, jazz.   ps. people will also say the suns had lucky injury influenced runs. i say don't count out a team full of young guys who ran to the finals on their first every playoff run. they'll believe they can do it again and i fully expect them to be a top 4 seed"
Anthony Edwards
Anthony edwards will prob get 30 ppg soon. But on 45 shots a game 🥲🥲🥲
As long u fuck with Anthony Edwards MVP season 30ppg we ride.   I can only dream hahaah
Gonna be Anthony Edwards of this year. Hope he can catch some bodies like that Watanbe dunk
Anthony Edwards football comment.
anthony edwards is  ja morant and dillon brooks got to the 8 seed last year and you're telling me KAT and Ant and D'lo cant do it?
I don’t disagree- just don’t think you can call Anthony Edwards “incredible” and “tremendous.”
"super low, they just brought in d'lo because they were best buddies in AAU.  he also had an extremely rough year losing his mom to covid and dealing with a severe case himself  I think timberwolves are poised to make a big jump this year with everyone healthy and a new coach and anthony edwards taking a step forward, sleeper 7 seed"
Anthony Edwards was one of the most inefficient players in basketball for half the season.
Why not? Anthony Edwards was incredible and the wolves were not.
it definitely is because kat is bad and not because his teammates the last two years outside of maybe Dlo and Anthony Edwards would struggle to find any minutes on a half decent team /s
"I disagree. I think that Melo has a unique ability to create offense out of nothing and change the momentum of a game. Even if he’s not hugely efficient over long stretches, he makes timely shots and always demands defensive attention. It’s really a failure of analytics that stats don’t measure the full impact of high-volume, low-efficiency scorers like Melo, Lou Williams, Russ, and even younger guys like Donovan Mitchell and Anthony Edwards.  Also I guarantee Melo was not a net negative either for attendance or for the locker room."
"I was making an point that you should just say anthony edwards, every nba players gets an nick name, most don’t make any sense. So yes this was sarcasm."
"Shit, I didn’t know I hated Anthony Edwards too."
Anthony edwards is on this sub isn’t he
"I know hes gonna fuck up at some point, but Anthony Edwards seems completely incapable of taking an L rn. Everything he says is charming, funny or thoughful."
"Good on Anthony Edwards.   Never mind the haters. If MJ played in this era, he would be crucified the same way LeBron does. How MJ gets superstar calls. I heard that a lot while watching MJ btw. People will also clown MJ if he failed to beat the Warriors + KD. The only difference between then and now is people never had the means to voice their hate. The age of social media."

"KD, Harden, Lebron, Dame Dolla, Anthony Edwards.  Turns out having multiple hobbies besides your career doesn’t mean you’re bad at basketball. r/NBA clown narrative whenever any player has other interests is clearly valid"
Harden clearly just cares more about music than basketball. Just like Anthony Edwards
Starting at guard for your SEATTLE TIMBERWOLVES Anthony Edwards!!!!!    j/k     but i've read things
Homer Pick: Keldon Johnson  Other: Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards because he’s from Atlanta like me. And he’s going to be nice
Anthony Edwards if he doesnt count as a star yet
I’ve been quite partial to Anthony Edwards’ interviews this year as well. It’s so tiring to just hear players run through the motions up on the podium.
Anthony Edwards and Cam Reddish
Anthony Edwards
"But Dame is like...5 levels higher as a scorer lol. He's like the same volume, but with a 8% high TS%, which is an absolutely massive difference. 8% is the difference between Steph Curry and Reggie Jackson or Terry Rozier, for example. Or hell it's the same as between Lebron and Anthony Edwards, Lou Dort, and Stanley Johnson lmao  Plus, while Russ is a better playmaker, but Dame gets 8 assists a night and is **extremely** low TO, whereas Russ obviously gets a ton of them. And we can see in this series that he's more than capable of upping that passing volume (10+ assists in 4/5 games so far)"
Anthony Edwards.
"I understand that. Teams usually become popular proportionally to how successful the team is. All I’m saying is it silly to complain about small market marketing when Giannis is one of the most popular players in the league. The wolves, pacers and Grizzlies don’t have anywhere near the kind of popularity that the Bucks do, and I understand that is because they are not as good as the bucks, but I find it hard to say that teams like the Jazz and the Bucks are poorly marketed from a wolves fans standpoint. I constantly hear about Giannis being the MVP and how the Jazz are the best team in the league, I’ve never heard anything from the media about the wolves except Anthony Edwards quotes, not that I expect anything (especially in the offseason), I’m just saying I find it hard to say the bucks are poorly marketed"
"You started very close to the point and then veer off in the wrong direction. The media wants to cover big markets, but most of all, they want to cover exciting, fun to watch superstars. Giannis get plenty of coverage because he's got a fun personality and he would get even more if he did more flashy plays like his euro step. Many casual fans were genuinely disappointed to see KD as the ASG captain because Giannis drafting against LeBron was way more entertaining. In the same vein, Embiid is a massively popular mfer, and Jokic is starting to get lotta attention as well. But it's really hard to draw in casual fans when your top player isn't far and out the best player when he's on the court, or when he's just a pretty bland dude. Kawhi only gets away with it because he's a top 5 player, on top of being so bland that it starts to get entertaining in and of itself. Anthony Edwards is a name I expect to be bigger than KAT by the next ASB even if KAT is the most talented player on that team. Trae and Luka also have the showmanship and game to carry any team to front billing. Young made me a fan during the playoffs and I'll b extremely surprised if he doesn't quite a few nationally televised games next year. Utah and Phoenix want more casual fans? They need showstoppers, out and out top players. Is it unfair that they can't get their names out while being contenders out of constructing their roster carefully from top to bottom? Not really because the NBA is basically a show biz."
Anthony Edwards says no
"Giannis ""Anthony Edwards"" Antetokounmpo"
Anthony Edwards gets murked repeatedly but he’s a rookie so it just doesn’t exist
"You make it sound like we picked Anthony Bennett and shit. We have had very low lottery picks except for Tatum, who is the best player from that draft.  Romeo had been injured but he looked great last night, with more consistency he could become a very low end starter or great 6th/7th man. Nesmith is also looking  like a pretty good pick. We didn’t have a lottery pick 2018 but we selected Rob Williams pretty deep and he’s been pretty good for us, except for injuries. PP also a deep pick that has panned out.  We scored on Smart in 2014, we scored on Terry on 2015, we scored on Jaylen in 2016 but most of those picks around then sucked besides those three. Since then, I’d say the only pick I’ve been super disappointed in is Carsen Edwards. Semi was great for a second round pick and I think Grant Williams has a little more to show, I think we’ll change our tune about him in the future."
Are you really going to say that Anthony Edwards wasn’t a top 3 rookie?
Kawhi Kd curry harden jokic embiid anthony edwards
"My pick is Anthony Edwards, if he keeps on improving that dude is gonna be scary in his prime"
"I hope so, my father and KD share a barber, and he asked if KD has ever mentioned the NBA subreddit because my dad goes to great lengths to try and show interest in the things that I enjoy. Their barber smiled and said Kevin talks about how much he loves the ""shitposts and comment sections"" and how we are the only group that really understands how to have fun on the internet. He even told a story about Kevin pulling up a post about Anthony Edwards going to Benihana, and he was laughing so hard, he misplaced the sharpie colored spiderwebs on top of Kevin's head."

Anthony Edwards just called me and said he's putting on the pads for the Vikes
"Well put. Damn, making me wonder how real Jimmy is, since there seems to a split between folk thinking he's a dick, and others who think he's a sweetheart.   Also I hope Anthony Edwards stays himself as he continues to rise in popularity. He's naturally charismatic."
Anthony Edwards by a mile
Disrespecting future MVP and Scoring Champion Anthony Edwards
Would’ve been cool to see Anthony Edwards on there one of these nights and get a younger player’s perspective. Plus he’s already from Georgia so it’d probably be easier to get him on
i think anthony edwards is a better comparison
39%TS? lmaoo at this rate Anthony Edwards will be a better playoff performer than Jimmy
"Embiid, Anthony Edwards and Kevin Durant"
Anthony Edwards
You need legends so JJ and Steve as entertaining as they are wouldn’t get on.   I think Curry has a shout tbf    Personally   Draymond Anthony edwards Boban as the host CJ McCollum
Anthony Edwards
"Kawhi, Giannis and Jokic are probably the main three examples of guys who achieved their potential in just about every conceivable way. They lack skills that there never part of their bag (playmaking, shooting and defense respectively), but they basically maxed out on their strengths.  Still, to say Wiggins' floor is PG is still a hot take. It'd be like saying Anthony Edwards' floor is Donovan Mitchell. You can see the similarities, but there's never a guarantee that they'll get to that level"
"Luka has always been and is the truth. He has been nice and had the attention since his NBA debut, and he is good enough to talk the talk and he has beef with the Clippers. Trae has been a star too, but he's just having fun, while playing the Knicks. Unless he makes it to an NBA finals, this is probably going to be one of the most intense environments he's ever played in. Ja has that Westbrook mentality, he plays like that every game regardless of the opponent and LaMelo and Anthony Edwards just celebrate after plays like normal players."
Anthony Edwards
I'm gonna put some investments in Anthony Edwards
So take Bryn Forbes over Anthony Edwards?
"Anthony Edwards has a lot of promise, plus they led the league by a Longshot in per 36 scoring stats. I'm absolutely not going to say they have the hall of fame type players that San Antonio had, but I think with some direction and if they can establish some kind of defensive identity, they will be okay"
"Zion, Ja and Anthony Edwards is the one we need to see"
I really wanna see Dame and Anthony Edwards have a soundcloud diss track back and forth
Much rather have Anthony edwards
What has he won?  Nothing.  He has gone from team to team and save for Miami (and any team can get lucky) did nothing noteworthy.  He is like a poor man's Carmelo Anthony.  Who cares if you can score points?  Like Herm Edwards says - YOU PLAY TO WIN THE GAME.
Meanwhile Anthony Edwards is chuckling in the front row seats.
"Age is irrelevant to how good he is *right now*. If you're taking age into account, Anthony Edwards should be way above Lonzo, and Luka should be in the first tier."
Look at Anthony edwards highlights
"Anthony Edwards has a little under 1400, is currently 19 and was scoring more by seasons end, so he’s the most likely at the moment."
Anthony Edwards.
"Genuinely too early to say. Guys like Ja, LaMelo, Anthony Edwards, and even dudes who haven't been drafted yet could end up on that list pretty easily."
Mic up and interview Anthony Edwards every game
Anthony Edwards. Buckets and funny quotes
"Anthony Edwards has a chance, surely"
"Ja ''if he made this one'' Morant, seriously dude has more failed attempts at something crazy than any other player ive ever seen.. Anthony Edwards got the dunk of the Years/decade in his first try in his rookie season"
1. Trae Young (MVP potential) 2. Ja Morant  (MVP potential) 3. De’Arron Fox 4. Lamelo Ball (MVP potential) 5. Anthony Edwards  6. SGA  7. Rj

Beal or Anthony Edwards.  SG is a somewhat rare position these days.   Everyone is a wing or PG.
This some Anthony Edwards tier level comment hahahaha
Anthony Edwards vibes
"Giannis ""Anthony Edwards"" Attemptafreethrow"
"Weakness, he’s still pretty Raw, Strength, he’s mf Anthony Edwards."
"[""Perfectly level flying is the supreme challenge of the drone pilot,""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L49ioi5PXqY&amp;t=10s) Anthony Edwards."
"Same with the lakers players too. We don’t know how players like ellington and ariza will fit in with the lakers, they could be a negative like Westbrook was. Also, I’m still taking injured Klay over ellington, nunn, THT, and Ariza lmao. Also, how was Kuminga horrible in the G league? He was inefficient sure but that’s to be expected from young players who are already planning to be one and done and quickly get to the league. Look at Anthony Edwards in college, shot 40% from the field and 29% from 3. Look at Lamelo in the NBL, shot 37.5% from the field and 25% from 3. This always happens for top prospects bc their main goal is to show their potential and skill, not really to win so they chuck. With a limited role, they usually look much better. The problem with Wiseman was that the warriors were asking too much of him. Trying to fit him in the starting lineup in a motion offense killed him. However, when he came off the bench with Poole, he looked good. Wiseman/Poole PnR was actually really effective. These are depth pieces. So to act like the lakers only lost bc their injured while the warriors are fully healthy is very stupid."
I think Anthony Edwards can do anything so sure
Anthony Edwards is looking a bit like the opposite - tons of red flags before his draft.
"Can confirm I’ve never heard a single black person in Atlanta ever say this. To understand our slang, see: Young Thug, 21 Savage, Anthony Edwards, etc."
"That's the worst 1st round pick since Anthony Edwards, they're not sweating losing him. At least be was a defensive guru  And Ben sucks"
Why does voter fatigue matter? I thought these awards weren’t supposed to be affected by narrative and were to be decided by stats? If the stats show Gobert is the best Defensive player this year then why would him winning it the past 2 seasons have any impact on that? Shouldn’t they be looking at this season and not allow their past choices to cloud their judgement?  Anyways here’s what I think.  MVP: Luka  DPOY: Gobert again  6MOY: D Rose  MIP: Anthony Edwards  ROY: Scottie Barnes based on the fact that the Raptors are better than the Pistons and I think they are better than the Rockets. Maybe them finishing higher and Barnes putting up decent stats swings the judges.  COTY: Steve Nash because the Nets with KD and Harden are really good and if they try in the regular season they could get a lot of Ws. If they load manage them then I think Spoelstra could lead the Heat to a really good record.
Anthony Edwards could have went pro in Gorilla Death Fighting if he wanted to
MVP: KAT  DPOY: D'lo  MIP: Anthony Edwards  ROY: Leonardo Bolmaro  6MOY: Malik Beasley  COTY: Chris Finch  Don't @ me.

Anthony Edwards dunks and sound bites.
Anthony Edwards is the preseason leader
Simmons for a NFT of an Anthony Edwards meme
"You're making a pretty bold claim. It's more like a lot of successful people *got lucky* and it didn't matter that they dropped out of school. Very, very few have the ability to guarantee success. Even if you're a can't miss prospect based off ability you can still always get injured or sick. For every Anthony Edwards (if we're going with him, even though for all we know he might've loved doing homework) there are 10000000000000 promising NBA prospects who never make it and end up with no education and no basketball money. For every drop-out billionaire there's a billion dropout bums.   We don't ""admit this"" to teenagers because chances are, if they blow off school, they will *not* have any good fallback. Naming a few 0.00001% lucky success stories is not proof of anything. It's cool that they're successful now, doesnt make every decision they ever made a smart one just because it led to this point."
Anthony Edwards. All you’d have to do is ask “can you give me the best piggy back ride of my life?” And he’d be like “fuck yea I’m the best at piggy back rides” and it would be delightful
Anthony Edwards have it all
"Anthony ""Johnny Sins"" Edwards  At some point in his career, he bout to fuck your team so hard it becomes iconic."
Anthony Edwards.
Anthony Edwards
Anfernee has been called Ant since he was a kid. It's his actual nickname.   And he's been in the league 2 years before Anthony Edwards. FOH with your weird ass energy
"bruh his name is anfernee, with an F  the only widely accepted ant in the nba is anthony edwards  call him fernesto or some shit idc but this trend of applying nicknames of popular/older players to rotational/younger players is confusing af and completely unnecessary"
Timberwolves Atleast got a pick in return for Wiggins. The GSW basically got the better end of the deal but the Timberwolves got Anthony Edwards out of if. As for Simmons...his contract actually gives the Sixers more control over his future than he has.  Only certain teams will be able to afford that contract and they all would benefit from Simmons. It might take longer but if Simmons wasn’t under contract he would just walk to another team and Sixers get nothing.
You forgot about Anthony Edwards
Chicago will be less than the sum of their pieces.   Colin Sexton may get moved.   Terry Rozier's last season was really underrated.   De'Aaron Fox should ask out of Sacramento.   Anthony Edwards is the first time KAT has had a legit co-star for more than a season.   Cole Anthony is really fucking good.
Anthony Edwards will go on to finish Top 5 All-Time in Points.
Anthony Edwards makes an All-NBA Team
All these kids with bad takes.. remember when anthony edwards called kd the Goat.. all of these millenials are same. They are block heads
Anthony Edwards becomes a top 15 player
"Anthony Edwards 🤷‍♂️   To answer the question though, I pick Ja. He has the intangibles and I see him becoming the better leader."
"Not really.  People think he can’t shoot because of his NBL stats but we should really disregard that now that we have a solid NBA sample size.  LaMelo made more threes his rookie season (92) than he took his entire season in the NBL (80). He shot 48% on 2s last season, putting him in the company of Trey Young, Kamba Walker, and Ja Morant. He shot better from 2 than Donovan Mitchell, Anthony Edwards, Russell Westbrook, Dennis Schroeder, Julius Randle, and D’Angelo Russell.  I’m too lazy to look up his stats before the injury, but if memory serves me correct he was shooting something like a 50/38/80 split. Post injury all his numbers really got dragged down and he couldn’t hit a three to save his life. Besides him constantly grabbing it every stoppage in play, it was obvious he needed more rehab time on that wrist to get his shooting form back.  But just from watching him, kid has a shooters touch. People hold his janky form against him but the ball goes in and his touch on 20 foot floaters is insane. Not to mention once he slowed down on his free throw routine he started shooting 85%.  Guy is a shooter, I think this next year really shows it."
So if there’s an image with Anthony Edwards and Kevin Garnett that means you’re comparing the two? No. The image is simply past and future.
"Patrick Beverley has been a godsend for the Wolves. Dude holds guys accountable on defense and everyone seems to be responding well to it, especially Anthony Edwards."
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"

Just came from the Nets game. Am I the only person that sees the resemblance between KD and Anthony Edwards? In the facial region specifically. Def look like they could be related.
Not looking forward to another year of people posting Anthony Edwards quotes and circlejerking about them
"Curry, Harden, Luka, Dame, Kyrie  Luka, Anthony Edwards, Trae, Morant, Fox"
1. Luka 2. Trae 3. Booker 4. Spida 5. Anthony edwards
"I'm not saying he is or isn't, but people shit on anything basketball player related pre 2000s (don't know why basketball is the only sport to really do that).  Mj played against scrubs so that's why LeBron is better...in twenty years it'll be the league has advanced so much since LeBron  so Anthony Edwards has to be the goat.  Bill Russell is the babe Ruth of basketball...and still a great ambassador of the game to this day.  Dude is top 5 no matter what era he played in."
Anthony Edwards
"He’s good for PR in the sense that he’s usually low-key and kinda boring in responses. On the other hand he’s not super exciting or generating attention the way Anthony Edwards does with the press for example.   There’s always gonna be something to point to with anybody though probably by accident, Kemba wore that tea party flag same time Harden wore a blue mask and everyone freaked out lol"
I’m sleeping with Anthony Edwards
No one gets to call you a bandwagon fan if they ever get good.    Plus they have young talent in Anthony Edwards and KAT (kinda).
"**High:** Anthony Edwards, not saying hes already reached his potential but I always believed in his Superstar upside despite the massive critics.  **Wrong:** Zach Lavine, always thought he had star potential on the Wolves but I never thought hed reach it due to the huge injury risk and him tearing his ACL made me lose faith."
Bro gets extended the day after Anthony Edwards schools him for the highlights. He’s a good player I just find that funny
curry is lame as fuck though.  Man golfs and is basically a churchgoing responsible old man that still looks like a kid with all the swagger of a pair of steph curry shoes.  Anthony Edwards on the other hand is just pure youthful confidence and bravado
Have you heard of Anthony Edwards?? Lol
Anthony Edwards
"Ja made rookie of the year as pick #2, Anthony Edwards didnt get ROTY at pick #1. So i'm just curious what potential your talking about? I just think yall saying Ant because he is a safe bet. This is basically apples and oranges here."
Jalen green should be 18-20 where anthony edwards was last season
Yeah preseason/summer league mean nothing   Anthony Edwards last year averaged 11/2/4 while shooting 29% from the field and 25% from 3.  Lamelo had 9/5/4 on 26/27/75 shooting.  Both of them had amazing regular seasons

"1.) Anthony Edwards - better team around him, all the tools, better coach  2.) Darius Garland - super slept on and Miami may have a better record but another year of Garland developing and he’s gonna put his name out there   3.) this is tough because I don’t see OKC doing much this season and would tank towards the end, I’m leaning Ingram because of the expected improvements   4.) Mo bamba just cause   5.) Mikal we’ve seen what he can do and I’m expecting improvements from him   6.) MPJ, he’s going to thrive as the second option without Murray there I hope JJJ has a great season and I was originally really high on him but idk anymore"
What do you get if you cloned Anthony Edwards? Morant.
JA is nice but I think I'll take my chances with Anthony Edwards because his ceiling is higher. That man is going to be a bucket.
"Nah, Anthony Edwards"
"how is this being upvoted at all? Anthony Edwards was/is in no way a ""non-shooter,"" and Cade was drafted in large part because of his elite shooting ability."
How so?   He has a standing vertical of 36 inches and is incredibly good agility/lateral quickness.   He isn’t a insane off-the charts athlete (like Anthony Edwards for example) but he is 100% an above average athlete with a big vertical jump.
"It's the difference between a Jerry West and your regular scout. Like when he was on the Lakers draft team, the team knew they were going to do whatever they could to get Kobe and then build around him because they saw a budding superstar. (At least according to the 1996 draft doc.) And that was all Jerry.  The guard position is more saturated than 'the special mobile 7-footer' position, so those guys tend to go later but spark later on a team: Jamal, Donovan, Booker, SGA, you name it.  Most of the time people grade off of freak athletic ceilings like Andrew Wiggins or De'Andre Ayton, Anthony Edwards because they like the possibility of what they can become.  West seems like one of those rare good eyes who is like ""why wouldn't I take the prodigy?"" and sees the mental/skill ceiling."
Kevin Garnett  Shaq (Orlando time period was the best)  Allen Iverson  Tim Duncan  Anthony Edwards
Thai dude is a gift. Love his interviews. Love his game. Love his attitude. @dmorey please trade for Anthony Edwards so these guys can all vibe together.
Anthony edwards
"Speaking solely from the Wolves perspective. Naz Reid has looked good, Jaylen Nowell looked solid last night and Anthony Edwards took a huge leap defensively"
Anthony Edwards playing defense
No ? Anthony edwards looks lost this preseason and Poole is shooting like crazy.  I will take the shooter
Id take him over anthony edwards at this point.  Jesus what a leap this kid has made
Id trade anthony edwards for Poole and kuminga.  Not sure if GS would agree
Anthony Edwards is getting to be my favorite player
"Nobody has to believe me on this cause I have no proof but I met a guy at a bar in Philly where Adam Sandler is filming his next movie, who was one of the body doubles for the movie  It’s about an NBA agent and among the players involved is Anthony Edwards. He specifically said that Ant is an extremely cool and funny dude. Also the main player in the movie is played by Juancho Hernangomez who apparently has acting chops"
"DK Metcalf: Height 6-3, weight 228, arms 34 7/8"", Standing vertical 40.5  Anthony Edwards Height 6-5. Weight 225, arms 40 1/2"", Standing vertical 41.5  Ya, the measurements listed from combines and players reporting are wrong. DK Metcalf is for sure bigger and faster and more athletic."
Or Anthony Edwards becomes an all-star and they are the 4th seed.   Not outside the realm of possibility.
"In what way is Ant bigger than Metcalf other than height.  Metcalf runs a 4.33 40 yard. Which is the 3rd fastest among all receivers (Usain Bolt ran a 4.22 btw). The fastest NFL player, Tyreek Hill runs a 4.29. Not only that but DK weighs more and is virtually the same height. At most he’s an inch shorter. He also has a 40.5 inch vertical. Ant jumps 1 inch higher. Highest NFL vertical is 46 inches. Highest all time in the NBA is obviously Jordan at 48 inches. Considering how much muscle DK has and how much more physically intense the NFL is, it’s safe to say he’s way more athletic than Ant.  And you can’t tell me [Ant](https://www.google.com/search?q=anthony+edwards&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-us&amp;prmd=nivx&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPrvr4wrvzAhWPHM0KHYd5CVYQ_AUoAnoECAIQAg&amp;biw=414&amp;bih=719&amp;dpr=3#imgrc=aDA3Dcs2nGYJbM) is bigger than [DK Metcalf (on the right)](https://www.google.com/search?q=dk+metcalf&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-us&amp;prmd=nivx&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiRkYCPw7vzAhWXVs0KHaNCD2AQ_AUoAnoECAIQAg&amp;biw=414&amp;bih=719&amp;dpr=3#imgrc=WQSQyoXDNvl79M&amp;imgdii=8IoaTZQ1lcTqNM)  And I hope you’re not talking about [Aaron Donald](https://www.google.com/search?q=aaron+donald&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-us&amp;prmd=nivx&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjm2J_ew7vzAhUGac0KHVlHD_AQ_AUoAnoECAEQAg&amp;biw=414&amp;bih=719&amp;dpr=3#imgrc=1z6L6YdiXXyHyM&amp;imgdii=15UXmEl7xgtOfM) lol"
"Embiid and Anthony Edwards would be must see TV, on and off the court"
Anthony Edwards bc he’ll be covering every sport year round bc he is prolific in all of them
I plan to stay up late this season for Anthony Edwards
"And you guys have softened on Russell:  &gt;“In any trade for Simmons, the Wolves would also consider Anthony Edwards to be completely untouchable. The Wolves would prefer to keep D’Angelo Russell but are believed to be willing to trade him if necessary.” The Real GM report explains, as it alludes to the precarious situation the Philadelphia 76ers find themselves in [Source](https://dunkingwithwolves.com/2021/10/07/minnesota-timberwolves-more-ben-simmons-reports-continue-to-make-noise/)  Just like everyone said they would.  Until something gets done we won't know, but the reports seem to be moving in the Sixers direction rather than the other way around."
"Put me on the list cuz I saw an interview with Dominique Wilkins and thought huh, he looks a lot like Anthony Edwards. Then I remembered Tony’s from ATL…but I know it’s just very wrong and reckless speculation."
Looks like Anthony Edwards in a suit
"Each of my comments has referenced a very specific paragraph in said article which begs the question: did you read the article?  *The conventional wisdom around the league has been that Simmons would be a natural fit with Karl-Anthony Towns. In any trade for Simmons, the Wolves would also consider Anthony Edwards to be completely untouchable.*"
Anthony Edwards is the next face of the NBA after Lebron
"I mean if Jaden mcdaniels and Anthony edwards don't live up to their defensive potential then I agree.  But the idea when you draft guys though is that they will, and then you go from there"
Who the fuck would trade Simmons for anyone on the TWolves non playoff making roster not named Anthony Edwards? Not the Sixers. 🤷‍♂️  Edit to fix the name of the Minnesota basketball team
I love Anthony Edwards. The guy is hilarious lmao. I was just saying that other people were voicing concerns about his commitment to basketball.
Bullish but Anthony Edwards is untouchable 😂   Yea ok 🙄
"So you're gonna run out a lineup of :  Patrick Beverly, Anthony edwards ,??? , Ben Simmons, KAT.  That will be what seed exactly?  And then we have no picks... what good does that do"
People were questioning Anthony Edwards' passion for the game and now he's looking like he'll be a future star.
Anthony Edwards is a part time NBA player since he’s also an NFL/MLB/Swimmer/Bowler/Rapper
"I know it's a really small sample size, but last night, defense looked like the stronger end of the court. Anthony Edwards has been prioritized on that side of the game, and now they can throw out lineups with Pat Bev / Okogie / Edwards / Vanderbilt (or McDaniels) / and KAT or Naz Reid. Those lineups are gonna be pests defensively"
They looked very good with Chris Finch especially Anthony Edwards. There’s no reason (besides injuries of course) that they shouldn’t be competing for a Play-In spot at the very least.
Do they have Anthony Edwards or no?
Anthony Edwards would do great as Moses Shuttleworth. Just seems like a guy who puts 100% into everything.
Anthony Edwards is a mini Zion who can shoot. Scary stuff
Anthony edwards= mj propaganda  Jalen Green= kobe/mj hybrid propaganda
"Anthony ""L Lawliet"" Edwards"
I'm pretty confident Anthony Edwards will be everyone's favorite player when he balls out this year. He's such a quote machine.
Kiss me right on the lips Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards is younger than Jalen Suggs
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."

"And what makes ppl think they will win with Edwards?  If anything KAT looked just as promising during his second year.  The truth is, Anthony Edwards may or may not be better than KAT, its too early to tell, but in KAT, you already know you’re getting a top 20 talent at worst.  In fact, there are no more than 2 bigs that i would surely take over KAT."
&gt;I want to see what he can do next to a legit every night star. I think he'd surprise some people.  Like Anthony Edwards is on his way to being a star and the dude is still saying he wants KAT gone to see him next to a star lol
"For real. I'll admit that when Fitz gets salty, he's unbearable as hell. But to say that he never gives opposing teams credit is just completely untrue. If you even just watched tonights game, he was practically gushing over Anthony Edwards for much of the game, and was very complimentary of Naz Reid too."
someone get Anthony Edwards some HELP
Anthony Edwards is the fucking man. He answers only to God. They need to build around him now. Fuck KAT.
"After watching this game, it’s clear Anthony Edwards is Minnesota’s best player and leader.   Kat will never have the edge to him to build a franchise around. And I love Kat."
Anthony Edwards wants to be Steph so bad but he’s only capable of 7 threes and 48 points instead of 9 and 50 😌 /s
"big ups to anthony edwards, no quit in him. i think its safe to say he's put to rest all the pre draft concerns about his motor and passion for the game"
We’re witnessing the birth of a superstar in this league.   Anthony Edwards is that man.
We’re witnessing the birth of a superstar in this league.   Anthony Edwards is that man.
"Anthony ""despite the loss"" Edwards."
"wiggins is so good for us man. i will never under appreciate what he provides for us. on a side note, anthony edwards is fucking elite, Jesus"
Anthony Edwards was just unstoppable
Anthony Edwards was just unstoppable
Anthony Edwards scary
I've been watching them big up Anthony Edwards this entire game.
"Props to Anthony Edwards though, damn dude hell of a game"
Anthony Edwards is a future MVP and possible future champ if he leaves the Wolves
Anthony Edwards is insane
Anthony Edwards ain’t no first overall pick for nothing. My goodness.
Anthony MOTHERFUCKING Edwards. You gotta capitalize that shit every time from now on. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
 You got the Warriors bench vs Anthony Edwards… lol
Anthony Edwards is a monster.
"He’s not that kind of guy, it’s obvious that’s he’s very reserved and keep to himself. Anthony Edwards might be the kind of guy that can change their culture though."
"Yeah I agree, he definitely can get annoying and also goes on rants about stupid stuff not about the game he’s calling. I think he’s been much better recently and just seems to be enjoying the game more and just having fun calling games. During the second quarter of tonight’s game vs Twolves, he hyped up Pat Bev and Anthony Edwards for a solid minute or two."
Lost in the Warriors greatness is Anthony Edwards’ stellar first half.
Anthony edwards playing that Dame defense lmao
Anthony Edwards looking great especially when that three is dropping. it opens up his game so much
"anthony edwards is gonna be an MVP, so good scoring"
"Right, they had three #1 overall picks at one point (KAT, Bennett, Wiggins) and now they have another #1 overall pick with Anthony Edwards.  They don't need more #1 overall picks.  What they need is good players, and a good coach to make those players play well together.  That's the key to this game.  Points, rebounds, assists... it's a simple game."
"Listen, Warrior commentators aren’t the best but y’all exaggerate so much lol  Look at this Anthony Edwards dunk, they’re hyped asf: https://youtu.be/yyDers9mw4s   Yeah when they’re bad, they’re terrible, but at least they always commentate with energy. I agree with what someone said that when the play-by-play guy tries to do some analysis is when the commentary gets sour.  You want to talk about bad commentating though. Watch any highlights from any Raptors games with their announcers. Mfers act like every shot the Raptors make is a game winner, but when the other team is playing offense they commentate like they’re calling a game of bingo"
"I was wondering the same thing. There are so many other great matchups today that could have been slotted for that time. Jalen and Cade are not box office like Zion and Ja Morant, even Lamelo and Anthony Edwards."
They're not saying to get rid of Anthony Edwards.
"I have no idea what Anthony Edwards plays like, except that he’s really athletic and likes shooting threes"
Anthony Edwards will be a 40% 3PT shooter one day.
Anthony Edwards maybe
"Right now I'd say LaMelo, Edwards, Cole Anthony, Haliburton, and Saddiq Bey are better. I'm also buying all the Wiseman stock still, he wasn't up to expectations but wasn't as bad as people think he was. We haven't seen him yet this year and Maxey has taken a leap so Maxey ahead of him but long term I think I'd take Wiseman"
"I mean outside of LaMelo (who is clearly the best) and Edwards (who is clearly the 2nd best), he could reasonably end up in 3rd.   Currently, he's competing for that 3rd place spot with Cole Anthony, Tyrese Haliburton, and Desmond Bane (Patrick Williams would be up there too but he's hurt)"
"No. I've long said he's far more polished than draft pundits and Sixers fans believed. Before this season it was ""he can't take care of the ball. He doesn't have good handles. He's not that fast (this one is from the draft pundits). He's not really a point guard. He can't shoot."" I watched him at Kentucky and back then, I believed he was right up there with the top players of his draft, Anthony Edwards, LaMelo Ball, and James Wiseman."
"Anthony Edwards, last year, first 16 games:   .344/.274 with atrocious defense.   Lots of rookies start very poorly. It's *hard* to play in the NBA when you're 19 or 20 years old."
Your idea is correct but I think Anthony Edwards is shooting worse now than the beginning of last year.
Trae young and Anthony Edwards.   Obviously players can turn around their shooting from their first 11 games.
I'm going to get downvoted because he's the darling of this sub but anthony edwards really needs to learn how to play winning basketball. The wolves will never win anything with him shooting that many shots this inefficiently
"Ooh boy where do I begin with this?   * He never knew when to call timeouts. Coaches generally call timeouts when the opponent starts to get some momentum, but Ryan would wait until it was too late.   * Never really figured out how to get Anthony Edwards involved in the offense. This is the big reason why Ant had a great second half last year, Finch was able to figure this out.   * Power forward Josh Okogie   * Insistence on jacking up threes despite the lack of personnel to attempt threes at a high rate. We were top 3 in attempts and bottom 3 in conversion. If the threes weren't falling, there really wasn't any other gameplan. In postgame interviews, his solution seemed to be that eventually they would fall.   * Speaking of postgame interviews, it often seemed like he was struggling for words when asked questions by reporters. Things just seemed to be moving too fast for him."
Anthony Edwards is the best ever
Jaden Mcdaniels and Anthony Edwards in their primes together will be monstrous
"Anthony Edwards is, 6'5, 230, one of the fastest players in the league, but still insists on taking 9 3s a game despite being a horrible shooter since high school."
1.	Lamelo  2.	Anthony Edwards 3.	Cole Anthony     ——  1.	Luka Doncic 2.	Ja Morant 3.	Zion Williamson 4.	Trae Young
1)Lamelo Anthony Edwards   2) Luka Ja Trae Zion
Zion Morant  Cole Young  Lamelo Anthony  Trae Edwards  Anthony Doncic
"1) Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, Cole Anthony.  2) Luka Donnakick, trae young, Zion Williamson( assuming he’s the 27 ppg 60% fg beast he was last season) and ja morant."
anthony edwards*
Didn’t Anthony Edwards grow like 2 inches over the offseason?
"Lol, you can tell who’s a casual when they say Edwards is funnier because he has more chuckles per interview. If you look at chuckles/36, Cole Anthony is way more productive."
"It’s the 10th game of the regular season bro, relax. I could see your concern if we were half war through the season or if Green hadn’t shown any flashes yet, but he’s had games where he’s dropped 30 and 26 within these 10 games. Just give him time, LaMelo Ball and Anthony Edwards we’re looking bad early last season and look at them now"
Funnier than Anthony Edwards??? No way lol.
This feels like an Anthony Edwards quote.
"Klay, Embiid, Butler, Giannis, JTA, Iguodala, and Anthony Edwards."
"Embiid, Anthony Edwards, PatBev, Giannis"
Anthony Edwards
behind curry and derozan and anthony edwards.  you can make a case for his defense without using the dumbest ass stat.
"Lmao thank you, I was lost entering this thread. Like how tf did anthony edwards get traded to the blazers and it wasn’t a front page post"
It took me forever to figure out who “ant” was on the Blazers. Because “Ant” is Anthony Edwards’ nickname. I had to look at the Blazers’ roster ages to figure out who was 22. And apparently I’ve been pronouncing Anfernee’s first name wrong for four years. I always thought it was Afernee.
This is actually NBA content so it should stay up. Anthony Edwards talking about peanut butter seemed fine so surely this won't get removed.
"There are 8 people with more fgm so far. He and 2 other people are tied 9th/10th/11th. Who calls that being tied at 11th? I always hear either tied for 9th (like the nba website has) or tied 9th to 11th.  He’s also played 334 total minutes. Per 36, he’s put up 21.6 fga. Of everyone who’s played at least 75 minutes, his per 36 fga is tied with Booker’s and ranks 7th and 8th behind Mitchell, Beal, a tie between Luka and Clarkson, PG, and Anthony Edwards in that order.  Lots of other people have ranked way higher in total fga than total fgm. That includes guys in the above list like Beal  (8th in fga and tied for 24th/25th in fgm) and ones who aren’t like Dame (tied 11th to 13th in fga but from 42nd to 46th for fgm).  Tatum’s struggling bad enough that added context and a less misleading title wouldn’t take away from your overall point."
How many players in the league are in better shape than Zion?   A lot  How many players in the league are more athletic than Zion?   Basically none (maybe Anthony edwards)   If you think being in shape is different than conditioning but is the same as athleticism than you don’t understand the words your using.   Glad your leaving me alone though
"Anthony Edwards is a super fun player, worth watching for him at the very least. Could be a great team. All the midwestern teams right now have potential to be greatly competitive in a couple years."
"Anthony Edwards, Draymond, Embiid and Brian Scalabrine in Ernie's role"
Anthony Edwards
"Karl Anthony Towns – 16/40 FG (40%) – 1/1 from 3 (100%)   Ben Simmons – 18/41 FG (44%) – 0/2 from 3 (0%)   Markelle Fultz – 8/23 FG (35%) – 0/0 from 3   Deandre Ayton – 16/29 FG (55%) – 0/0 from 3   Zion Williamson – 24/36 FG (67%) – 4/6 from 3 (67%)   Anthony Edwards – 19/45 FG (42%) – 4/17 from 3 (24%)   Cade Cunningham – 7/39 FG (18%) – 1/21 from 3 (5%)"
"No need to overreact so early on. Cade's got a high floor and he'll eventually get there but the early numbers are what they are. And since everyone is bitching about his stats being comped to Anthony Bennett, here's his numbers next to the last 6 number 1 picks.  Karl Anthony Towns – 16/40 FG (40%) – 1/1 from 3 (100%)  Ben Simmons – 18/41 FG (44%) – 0/2 from 3 (0%)  Markelle Fultz – 8/23 FG (35%) – 0/0 from 3  Deandre Ayton – 16/29 FG (55%) – 0/0 from 3  Zion Williamson – 24/36 FG (67%) – 4/6 from 3 (67%)  Anthony Edwards – 19/45 FG (42%) – 4/17 from 3 (24%)  Cade Cunningham – 7/39 FG (18%) – 1/21 from 3 (5%)"
"pretty much what i expected. explosive scorer and athlete that is extremely inconsistent so far. his highlights will probably look a lot better than his numbers until his game settles down a bit and he finds that consistency, but i think it will happen. reminds me of where anthony edwards was at early last year."
Anthony edwards had a rough first half last year (shooting %) and look at him now
Anthony edwards is making his whole career off of that
Anthony Edwards is definitely the type of dude to ask for a trout sandwich.
Anthony edwards
"Anthony Edwards and I are done professionally, bro."
"I mean, you have the right to share your opinion no matter what lol the ""right"" to shit on a player is pretty subjective.  Maybe KAT is tired of watching Edwards chuck 22 shots a game on horrible efficiency.  Can you explain why anthony edwards should be taking 5 more shots than a top 5 offensive player in the NBA?  KAT has been playing great 2way ball and shooting lights out, tough to imagine him being happy watching a 20 year old come in like he's kobe bryant and owns the team."
"I really thought getting rid of Wiggins and Rubio would change a lot, but I guess we have to get rid of KAT also. All three of those guys are mopers than play crappy. Anthony Edwards is the best thing to happen and KAT is ruining him already"
"Seriously? This is such a dumbass thing for KAT to do, he’s been talking himself up all season, Anthony Edwards has stepped up, they finally have a good coach, and then the first losing streak of the season he’s liking tweets about bailing?  Lol nah that franchise has bent over backwards for him time for KAT to actually deliver."
This is a perfect example of how stats don't show context.   Anthony Edwards is high motor player with limited basketball/shooting skills. Andrew Wiggins is a skilled player with poor motivation and work ethic. It's a lot more frustrating to watch a skilled player settle for 19 foot jump shots or go periods of the game without even touching the ball than a player who is going 100% all the time but not capitalizing on open shots or making basketball mistakes.  So AE will ideally improve as he puts more time into his basketball skills. Similar to a guy like Giannis in his rookie/early years.  But Wiggins was NBA ready since high school and was expected to hit the league at a top level. There's not much you can coach or work on with someone who doesn't want to put the effort in.
"So you're high on Anthony Edwards largely cause of his athleticism, think he could improve if he learned to shoot? But if he developed like Lavine (phenomenal athlete and elite shooter now), that'd be bad?"
Fucking man of culture right there.  Jalen Green. Anthony Edwards. These two dudes have me questioning my sexuality with every interview they take.
"Anthony Edwards just lost a fan.  Once you go crunchy you'll never go back....and once you go peanuts only crunchy, then you'll despise those sugar filled peanut like spreads Jif be selling."
"A lot of people thought Anthony Edwards wasn't ""great"" yet. He was very inefficient last year until the end of the season. He is only in his second year and there is still a lot of potential since he has shown he is dedicated to improving himself."
"Every time I think about Anthony Edwards I think about how differently ballhandlers and bigs operate. Edwards isn't the best player on his team, I think most people would say KAT is, and yet he takes the most shots by a wide margin and has the highest usage rate. Hell, even Dlo has a higher usage rate than KAT. KAT's not a great defensive player, but offensively he can really do it all and then some, yet he's in this weird 2nd/3rd banana role that he's probably not happy with.  Bigs ultimately need to be literally set up for success in ways that ballhandlers just don't. It's a tough life for them."
Congratulations to Anthony Edwards for being the first black man
Anthony Edwards is a stud. Man plays with no fear and has the talent to back it up.   KAT seems to not get it. It’s your team.
"I mean the problems in Minny are partially of KAT's own making given how he wanted to play with D-Lo. D-Lo is clearly in the bottom third of starting PGs in the league. Considering he was supposed to be the Robin to KAT's Batman, that's a pretty horrible result. Anthony Edwards is improving but he still is below average TS% with bad defense and a negative BPM. I do think Edwards could be a star soon though."
Trade his ass out of Minny. Anthony Edwards wants win and not mope and bitch about losing. KAT is a FRAUD
Good scoring on league average shooting when he was literally 19 years old. You have no idea what you’re talking about. Anthony edwards looked like shit 30 games into his career too. Fans like you are the worst.

"Lol. Same height as Westbrook, one inch shorter than Wade and Anthony Edwards, taller than Rose. It’s a pretty normal height for athletic NBA guards, and very few people ever bring up those other guys heights as impressive. Idk what that dude is smoking."
Anthony edwards is a very good defender
"Homer take but Trae has stepped up as an emotional leader. He’s not as good as someone like Anthony Edwards because he’s kinda more awkward and reserved but he seems to hype his teammates up and focus on getting the team to work together.    Also speaking of Anthony edwards, I’d say he’s one of the best young natural leaders in the league right now. I think he’s gonna lead Minnesota to great things."
I wouldn’t be surprised if he had an Anthony Edwards type of improvement in the second half of the season
1. Anthony Edwards  2. Lamelo Ball  3. Cole Anthony   4. Tyrese Haliburton  5. Saddiq Bey / Desmond Bane / Jaden McDaniels / Tyrese Maxey
Edwards  Lamelo  Haliburton  Saddiq   Bane / Anthony
"Anthony Edwards, KAT, D Lo, and their next ten firsts should get it done /s"
"As expected, Anthony Edwards pushing Jimmy Butler for no reason is good according to r/nba"
I am in love With Anthony Edwards and I don't care who knows it
"&gt;Karl-Anthony Towns was asked postgame about his exchange with Jimmy Butler, and Anthony Edwards stepped in to take the answer   &gt;   &gt;""Man, they grown men, dog. They just be talkin, havin a regular conversation, if you ask me... It's no competition if we not talkin shit to each other.""  [https://twitter.com/DaneMooreNBA/status/1390871279314554883](https://twitter.com/DaneMooreNBA/status/1390871279314554883)"
Remember when Anthony Edwards was supposed to be someone who did not care about basketball and the next Wiggins?
Honestly anthony edwards dunk on yuta was nastier
"exactly. for reference, he has less NBA games played than Anthony Edwards, and only a few more than Lamelo. Obviously he doesn't have the potential of those two players, but THT hasn't even had a full season of play to develop and is still working on that consistency."
Anthony Edwards’ dunk last year was pretty crazy: https://youtu.be/iODDxjp936A  Zach Lavine had a 360 dunk last week: https://youtu.be/l_EwrGCvtwc
I’m waiting for Anthony Edwards to join this list this year
"Between the two,  Lamelo:  •Higher PER (17.5 vs 13.9) and TS% (.539 vs .523) •Higher ORG (1.2 vs .8), DRG (4.7 vs 3.8) RPG (5.9 vs 4.7) As well as higher rebound percentages •Higher APG (6.1 vs 2.9) and AST% (33.9 vs 14.6) •Higher SPG (1.6 vs 1.1) and STL% (2.7 vs 1.7) •Lower usage percentage (26.1 vs 27) •Higher win shares (2.8 vs .8), box score +/- (1.9 vs -2.6) and VORP (1.4 vs -.3)  Edwards:  •Higher PPG (on more FGA per game [16.8 vs 13.2] more 3PA per game [7.2 vs 5.1] on a higher 3PAr [.429 vs .388] and more FTA per game [3.8 vs 3.2], also less efficient scorer than Ball when using TS% and FG%, while also having a lower efficient field goal percentage.) •Higher BPG (.5 vs .4) and BLK% (1.3 vs 1.2) •Less turnovers per game (2.2 vs 2.8) •Less personal fouls per game (1.8 vs 2.7)  The only argument that can be made for Edwards is totals, due to Ball missing 21 games due to injury. Lamelo led or nearly tied Anthony in virtually every statistical metric with the exception of PPG (which Edwards won handily, but this point is easily refutable due to Ball’s higher efficiency and shooting percentages.)  Statistically, Ball was the better player."
"People tend to forget this   The guard position is currently stacked and will be stacked in the future  haliburton currently has to compete with dudes like Steph, Dame, Luka, CP3, Book etc for all star votes for the next couple years and when they retire he has to go through guys like Luka still, Book and guys that show much more promise than he does like Morant, SGA and Anthony Edwards and he isn't even the best guard on his team rn"
You probably called Anthony Edwards a bust too last year
cade  floor middleton ceiling current tatum  Jalen green floor jamal crawford ceiling anthony edwards(prime)  Scottie barnes floor draymond  ceiling jimmy butler  mobley (very high on) floor bam ceiling Anthony davis
anthony edwards too
"Borders more on assholery than me being petty, but I lowkey get excited every time Anthony Edwards has a bad game. The ROY race last year really soured my opinion of him as a result of Timberwolve fans relentlessly shitting on LaMelo. One of the most egregious takes I saw was one of them claiming his peak was Ricky Rubio."
"I despise Anthony edwards and watch a ton of twolves games just to cheer against him, he will never be as good as lamelo"
Anthony Edwards up there too
Anthony Edwards will be shooting so well he'll change his name to Kyle Rittenhouse
Anthony Davis  Giannis Jokic  Jayson Tatum Zion if healthy (not lookin likely but still) Ja Morant  Joel Embiid  Lamelo Ball Anthony Edwards Deandre Ayton  Evan Mobley  Emoni Bates  Bronny Jr Victor Wembayana  These are just the standout talents of you told me they are going to be the best player in the world I can clearly see why   What is Luka’s why?
"Regression is coming, sure. But this isn’t your old Wolves defense. They are really flying around and connected.   Pat Bev from Rubio is about as big of a defensive upgrade as u can get. Anthony Edwards, to me, looks like he can become an all-nba defender. They were sticking him on an island vs PG at times and he was doing ok, and outstanding considering he’s a raw 20 year old.  He can improve off ball, but imo the effort is there, he isn’t just biding his time on D until he can play O.  I do expect some regression. But this isn’t the bottom feeding defense Wolves fans are used to.  Vando Bev Ant &amp; JMac are all legit defenders.  I feel like Naz holds his own as well.  The defense last night versus NOP was probably the best defensive effort I have ever seen out of this team as a whole, including the KG years."
"We get new formulas every year now too they just obfuscate rather than illuminate. This push to make the subjective into the objective takes away the artistry and creativity of athletics to me. It’s not why I watch the games. I just feel like people are getting into the weeds and missing the joys of sport now.   Stats are useful and they illuminate what you’re seeing but they’re not the story. They’re subtext. But nowadays they’re the dominant context for when we’re talking about these leagues. I’m really over it.   The constant rankings of players, or those stat posts about how a player is the 2nd ever to have a 28/12/13 game or some other inane stat line is just boring. It’s boring! Those aren’t the cool parts about this!!   It’s like that Anthony Edwards dunk last year that was amazing against Toronto. And then you had people who supposedly like basketball talking about how his efficiency wasn’t good so the dunk isn’t cool. Like what?? I don’t get it"
I truly believe Anthony Edwards can be that guy . Just not in Minnesota ( sorry wolves fans )
anthony edwards if we're going for 'compete in every sport' imo
Anthony Edwards. Top ten in minutes per night but excelled more or less in another sport (football) in grade school.
Anthony Edwards is up there
Anthony Edwards is basically Ja plus 40 pounds
Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards hot streaks are a thing of beauty.
You probably wouldn’t have been cheated on if you spent more time with your partner instead of on Reddit hating on Anthony Edwards
Anthony edwards is Coool but yea at a point you can be a little too tall for football.
"Crazy how insane some of these dudes would be if they played Football. Especially with the height and quickness combined with the athleticism? Kawhi, Anthony Edwards, Lebron, etc"
"Some that come to mind.  If you're a bigger scoring guard that can run PnR and shoot 3s you're Harden/Ginobili (especially if you're lefty). Examples: Jaden Hardy, DLo, Luka, Cade.  If you're a skilled off ball guard that can shoot you're Ray Allen/Klay/Beal and recently Lavine. Examples: Jalen Green, Buddy Hield, Malik Monk, Booker, Mclemore.  If you're an undersized but strong and long two guard who can't shoot well you're Wade. Examples: Jaden Ivey, Marcus Smart, Donovan Mitchell, Oladipo, Anthony Edwards.  If you're an explosive and fast PG, you're Rose. Examples: Wall, Fox, Morant. Maybe Westbrook, Baron Davis, and Steve Francis are other common comps.  If you're a PnR playmaking PG that can't shoot, you're Rondo. Examples: Schroeder, Kris Dunn, Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina."
I like Anthony Edwards. He's fun to watch on and off the court.
Cole Anthony Edwards
"Targeting like that only works when Denver’s POA defenders can’t fight through screens at all, which killed them all series against PHX because Facu and rivers blow. When it’s Murray and Barton all of that looks quite different, also Porter was way stiffer and less mobile than normal in that series. Dude had played as many games as Anthony Edwards since high school to the inexperience shouldn’t be shocking"
"Ant Brogdon and Capela would just be Star Players  Superstar - Lebron KD AllStar - Booker, KAT etc. Star - Ayton, Anthony Edwards, Brogdon Role Players - Wiggins, Anunoby, Iggy, Caruso"
"I personally have a couple distinctions  Superstar, all star   and then the elite category between those two and role players   I wouldn’t call guys like Anthony Edwards Malcolm Brogdon or Clint Capela all stars but they are above role players. CJ is in that category"
Yeah man it’s a conspiracy against Anthony fucking Edwards
"Rebounding has been a significant issue for them throughout the season, and is a legitimate complaint about their defense. And ""that's going to change"" is irrelevant because we're talking about the current team and Anthony Edwards. Yes I have no doubt he'll become an inefficient scoring threat as good as almost anyone in the league, but right now in his second season thus far he's remained a bit of a chucker who should still be a secondary scorer to KAT."
"[Another fun fact about this group, courtesy of Dane Moore:](https://twitter.com/danemoorenba/status/1462308369591672832?s=21)  “The Timberwolves have a defensive rating of 99.1 in the 281 minutes that Karl-Anthony Towns, D'Angelo Russell and Anthony Edwards have shared the floor this season.  Of the 98 3-man units in the NBA who have shared the floor for 250+ minutes, that Wolves trio ranks 8th.”"
If prime Michael Jordan played today he'd look like Anthony Edwards
"It's crazy how defensive and emotional this entire sub gets over any criticism of RJ. This dude was supposed to be a generational player, debated to be taken over Zion, who's greatest strength was scoring the basketball. And he's only putting up 15ppg in his third year, on bad efficiency.  It's not like it's unheard of for 20 year old players to be able to produce at a high level. Zion when he was healthy was putting up better numbers. Look at what Anthony Edwards is doing this year.  Even guys like Sexton who play a similar role to RJ have outperformed him at the same age."
"The problem they have isn't scoring, nor could it ever be scoring with these guys. It's WHO they give scoring opportunities to, and defense. Sure Anthony Edwards can drop 40, but the dude is generally inefficient. Which isn't a big deal if he's getting 10-15 shots, but it's a huge deal when KAT, one of the most efficient big men in NBA history, is given that many and Anthony is allowed to do whatever he wants all game. Luckily it seems like that's been dialed back a little bit lately, but Anthony Edwards and D'lo shouldn't be the focal points of the offense down the stretch when KAT is an option."
Wiggins 35/7/5 at 50-40-90 in a four game sweep. Anthony Edwards primarily guarded by Wiggins and shoots 30-20-60.
Last year's #1 draft pick Anthony Edwards
I am shocked I don't see more people talking about Anthony Edwards and Scottie Barnes.
"fuckin anthony edwards shot 100% through a good portion of the game, pretty ridiculous"
Stop trying to call Anthony Edwards the next Anthony Edwards. Anthony Edwards just needs to be the FIRST Anthony Edwards.
"Blog bois won't ever give Ant his credit. Doesn't matter that he's Anthony Edwards, because he's not Lamelo Ball."
Anthony Edwards is on the rise.
What does that have to do with Anthony Edwards?   You’re full of it
"As of right now the Wolves don't have an allstar. LeBron and AD will both make the allstar game, even if the Lakers are barely above .500, which will take away the possible frontcourt spot KAT could get. Guard is way too freaking deep for Edwards to make it, and as you can see from this breakdown, there will be an overflow of guards into the wildcard spots, making it so the bare mininum of 6 frontcourt players make it.   **Starters**  * Stephen Curry * Luka Doncic * LeBron James * Anthony Davis * Nikola Jokic  **Reserves**  * G - Donovan Mitchell * G - Chris Paul * F - Paul George * F - Draymond Green * F - Rudy Gobert * W - Devin Booker * W - Ja Morant"
Who knew Anthony Edwards was the next Anthony Edwards
"Anthony ""Michael Jordan"" Edwards is at it again"
"Lol the Stein article came out a few months ago that said ""The Timberwolves could get there with Karl-Anthony Towns, but Philadelphia doesn’t need a center and Minnesota has made Towns and promising second-year swingman Anthony Edwards unavailable in trade talks anyway.""  Like Philly not needing a center would hold them back from making that trade lmao"
anthony edwards thinks KD is the GOAT  MWP thinks kyrie is a top 5 player of all-time  iggy thinks kyrie is a top 20 player of all-time  i honestly dont give a fuck bout what players think lol. they overrate iso scoring heavily
"Anthony Edwards, so far the Guard competition in the west isnt that crazy as other years"
Anthony Edwards
Also thought the same about Anthony Edwards.
Anthony edwards gets his posts too whenever he has a good game.
Anthony edwards has a competent coach and is not engulfed with the losers for his whole career.  Patrick williams starts being aggresive
"I dont think DeMar is at that level of an in game dunker anymore.   DJJ, Lavine, Giannis, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Ja Morant, Paul George, Anthony Edwards, Larry Nance Jr, Zion, and maybe Kawhi I'd take over him."
"people listing some all time greats here who should be mentioned, but anthony edwards first step has to be up there with the best. he blows by people and makes it look effortless, like he's going at 75%."
TYRESE MAXEY IS BETTER THAN ANTHONY EDWARDS. HE AVERAGES A BETTER 3P% THAN EDWARDS DOES FG%
Remember when young Anthony Edwards said that he would have prefered to play in the NFL because he felt you can have more fun on the field than in the NBA?  https://brobible.com/sports/article/top-nba-draft-prospect-anthony-edwards-nfl/
Tyrese Maxey is better than Anthony Edwards
"I guess Paul George, Donavon Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Bradly Beal, and  Anthony Edwards aren't very good this year either since they all shoot 20 or more shots a game and all but Paul George have a worse shooting percentage than Luka even though Luka averages more points than all of them except Paul George by two points. That dang one bucket keeps stopping Luka from not being good."
Minnesota Timberwolves - Anthony Edwards  🐜   Edit: KAT is low key an underrated dunker.
"&gt;\[Highlight\] Westbrook turns the ball over 5 times and picks up a technical foul in the final 6:30 of the 4th quarter  Yup, stupid post.

Long shot anthony edwards
"I'm so happy we're witnessing greatness, the level he's hit these past few years has been absurd. Hearing Anthony Edwards describe having to play against him was hilarious. ""Our goal was to contain him... I mean you can't really contain him, he still got 40. He's 7' 280lb! Put four guys on him, maybe he misses, gets the board, BOW. He's amazing"""
"christ, another 'quirky' line from anthony edwards. yall really ride this dick eh?"
Not gonna defend his other takes but calling Anthony Edwards a bad shooter at this point isn't too crazy. He takes a *ton* of threes for someone who only makes 33% of them.
"Scottie, but I could see Jalen having an Anthony Edwards type season and making a run for it at the end"
&gt; .@JaceFrederick gave Anthony Edwards a jar of crunchy peanut butter. He said he’ll try it  What is it about this kid that everything he says and does is goddamn hilarious to me lol

Bro why does Anthony Edwards think he's kobe. Dude took double the shots of Kat who shot 75%
He's gonna be like Anthony Edwards last season where he starts out slow but puts it together and finishes blazing hot
Anthony Edwards won this game
Anthony Edwards is good at basketball.
"Now imagine anthony edwards for Simmons. Yeah, wolves don't do that either"
"I got the kings just cause they're the kings.   The timber pups are a funny organization. They had Zach lavine Wiggins and Kat.   Let go of Zach to get a Jimmy butler rental.   To then draft anthony edwards to hope he becomes Zach lavine lmao.  Gave up a high draft pick to get d Angelo Russell with their gm not knowing this draft class was loaded. The warriors get a freeby with kuminga, and Wiggins.   Somehow decided to extend the contract of a player smashing scottie pippens wife ."
"Well then he’s gonna have the same problems elsewhere because everyone does that. Marcus Smart just called out Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown like last week. Anthony Edwards called out Kat and Dlo. That’s what Teammates do when asked a specific question. None of them sulked and ghosted the team like Ben though, instead they listened and got better."
"Anthony Edwards efficiency issues have existed his entire career back to college and AAU and can't just be handwaved away by saying ""he's 20 and barely played a full season"" and he genuinely needs someone to coach that out, and I haven't seen it yet.  Handwaving away his efficiency issues on a lack of gametime, is like handwaving away James Wiseman not having Evan Mobley's ability to pick up guards on defense due to a lack of gametime - it's a genuine flaw in their game, not just ""a lack of experience"" issue.   While there have been players who have had inefficient first few years and developed, there has never been someone with as big of a BBIQ red flag ***pre-NBA*** as Edwards who has developed into an efficient star primary option on a team. And he's shooting like he's the primary option on a team.   Maybe he'll be the first who knows, but the laws of thermodynamics tell you you can't make matter of nothing, so i dont see how Edwards is going to develop this out of nothing when he can barely let genuinely the greating shooting big man ever take more shots than him.  My 2c but this opinion gets jumped everytime people bring it up - even the thread that showed a highlight of Edwards refusing to pass to a wide open KAT had more people shitting on KAT than blaming Edwards lmao."
Anthony Edwards is an overrated chucker   The Bucks would’ve gotten smashed in the second round last year if not for Brooklyn’s injury   The Lakers’ 2020 run was very easy. Only the Suns’ run last year was more pathetic
I don't find Anthony Edwards charming or funny when he says random shit.
Minnesota and Anthony Edwards
I was clearly dicking around.   There's not much that can be done on that team.    His running mates right now are Anthony Edwards and D'Lo. Two low efficiency guards taking almost 40 shots a game. One of those also being a kid learning the NBA game still
He should break down the play where he started walking back to half court as Anthony Edwards iso on the other side of the wing
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
Anthony Edwards tier
Jokes aside it would be funny if in a few years Giannis decided to just intentionally go to a bad team or historically unsuccessful franchise and tried to win a ring with them. Imagining him teaming up with Anthony Edwards on the Wolves or whoever on the Kings. I’d love to see it (not that I specifically want him off the Bucks).
Dawg Anthony Edwards is GOATed 🤣🤣 how can you not love this man?
"Uhhh yes tf it does?? Lmao what?! Dudes iso ball ALL THE TIME, star players do not walk off mid play. Lmao Anthony Edwards is at fault for *checks notes* playing the game of basketball. Like what the hell is going on where the guy actively hooping gets blamed for his teammate being a bitch"

Anthony Edwards is like that girl that won't let you give her a compliment 😭
"It takes maturity to crab dribble outta the clickbait ""NUMBER ONE PICK ANTHONY EDWARDS SAYS HE SHOT BETTER THAN SETH CURRY""   Stay humble, young man. You'll be eating steak and shrimp while an all star soon."
This title is super confusing if you only know Anthony Edwards from ER and Top Gun
"For sure, I feel that's the big thing is that us Armchair GM's only see little bits and pieces. I really had no idea who Anthony Edwards was as a person (nor do I know now either), but the snippets I got were terrifying lol. Turns out that I didn't know enough about him to know that he was probably just fucking around.  It's sort of a similar note to Book's remarks a couple weeks ago that everyone felt he was being a complete dick to the Greek reporter. Honestly, I feel that Book was pissed with himself based on the interviews I've seen of him and it came across wrong. That said, it's still just an insinuation, but seeing more of ANT in interviews tells me that he doesn't take life too seriously, but he always challenges himself to be great."
"For sure, I made a false equivalency with very little knowledge of the personality of Josh Jackson for example and equated that to Anthony Edwards. There was very little information there, but the little information that I had correlated them...  But turns out that I was wrong. Anthony Edwards despite having those similarities with Josh Jackson is actually willing to put in the work. I wish only the best for him and am glad he has Ricky to mentor him (but #FreeRicky anyways lol)"
Carmelo Anthony Edwards
Shitting on a 19-20 year old when he struggles and completely ignoring when he does good is a lame thing to do. If he’s gonna focus on one random Anthony Edwards game to try and diminish his moment then he should keep that same energy when he has great games but he wont. That’s why he’s lame to me
flight : Anthony Edwards to GsW confirmed
"There's only been 2 70+ win teams in NBA history so I fail to see the relevance of that, especially considering it's a known fact LeBron coasts in the regular season to avoid injuries as well as limit wear and tear. The 2013 Heat easily could've been a 70+ win team, samething with the 2017 Cavs   Towns has been limited due to COVID this season. But how is that related to seeing how Anthony Edwards future plays out?No one disputes Minnesota has under achieved with him but Edwards is a rookie and has every chance to do things with KAT. Give him a chance instead of saying its dead before it happens, you're remarkably pessimistic"
Is Anthony Edwards irish?
"The Utah Jazz were a 60+ win team both times Jordan played them, in 93 both the Knicks and Suns were 60+ win teams, in 96 the Sonics and Magic were 60+ win teams. I would advise doing a little research before making a claim like that again.   Again, my dispute with you is entirely over your claim on Anthony Edwards. The Wolves have a star in the making, they need to build around him yes but just proclaiming they're doomed to waste him is pointless. He's an exciting player and a really hilarious guy on the mic. Give them the chance to do something before calling it a failure"
Anthony Edwards throws down a ferocious dunk. The Internet: “Yeah but he is -7”  Ja Morant misses a ferocious dunk over Kevin Love   The Internet: “OHMYGODMVPMVPMVPMVP”  It wild how Twitter and Reddit chooses to love and hate.
"This interview : https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/18/potential-no-1-pick-anthony-edwards-on-watching-basketball-im-still-not-really-into-it/  I think the reporter just didn't convey Ant's tone, he was probably smirking and just playing around like he always does it seems. What he said was bad there's no denying that, he just wasn't serious. Problem is you don't get that just reading it"

"If Wiggins is Harrison Barnes 0.8, what does that make Anthony Edwards?"
"When Anthony Edwards went down last night, I was like “ah no.... no no no,” even as a Blazers fan. He came back and made some crucial shots and we lost because, well, that happens.   Hope to see this guy play in his rookie year in a stadium if covid winds down. He’d contend for RotY if Lamelo wasn’t balling out so damn hard."
"Man, what an Anthony Edwards hater that “Anthony Edwards” guy is."
&gt;Josh Okogie shouldn't be playing and Jake Layman isn't starting caliber.  I mean we have Culver also for the 3 spot and Anthony Edwards was actually our SF for a good part of the season. And Josh Okogie is fine in lineups with KAT and D'lo since he brings good defence and with offensively potent lineups his non existent offensive game isn't that deal breaking.
"Anthony Edwards, pre game: Man I hope I can have a really good game, we're gonna need points to match this high scoring Blazers team. Wonder who's guarding m-  _Guarded by Melo late_"

"I feel like he's the Athletic, forward that can get under the basket and make jumpshots that we all wanted Wiggins to be. Anthony Edwards at least seems to know the difference between a deep 2 and a 3"
Most disgusting dunk I've seen since Yuta got absolutely fucked on by Anthony Edwards tbh  The DJ BKnight dunk was... Goddamn that was insanely filthy. Up there with best ever

"Nah fam, Anthony Edwards committed straight homicide on Yuta. Went balls deep on him. This is a solid second place by far."
"Nah fam, Anthony Edwards committed straight homicide on Yuta. Went balls deep on him. This is a solid second place by far."
Anthony Edwards would literally have to average like 25 ppg on insane efficiency to make it “clear” he’s the better rookie. The best he can do by the end of the season is make it a real debate.
Carmelo Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards coming out party. Dude took over the game - even had excellent defense on Lillard late. He was a star tonight.
"Yes, but hey, remember Wiseman is almost a HS to NBA prospect. Guys like Lamelo or Edwards have had time to be ""the man"" the past year (Ball in the NBL Illawarra Hawks and Anthony Edwards in Georgia). Wiseman barely played in the college level. Also, the Warriors scheme is brilliant but complicated. Give the kid some time and I'm pretty sure he'll be good. He looks fluid for a 7 foot tall guy."
Turns out Anthony Edwards just dribbling straight is really hard to guard

[Anthony Edwards](https://imgur.com/a/IocYjm3) makes me feel good...
"Anthony edwards had an unbelievable game. First he scored 24, then ran into Kanter and went down for 45 seconds. Then he comes back into the game, and hits a three on Melo and does melos celebration. Then he has another mind melding dunk and finished with 34."
That Anthony Edwards dude can ball
Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards is what Mikey Williams hopes to be someday.
anthony edwards goes BOING!
Carmelo Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards having a good game but a rookie averaging 15.4 points a game on 37 % shooting should probably relax the talk on the floor.  He’s making fun of Melo’s 3 point celebration.
"Kat, Anthony Edwards and ————— were number one picks. Who am i forgetting?"
Yeah its just about development. Same with Anthony Edwards. If we develop them well they both have all star potential
I do not approve breaking up the Anthony Edwards / Rubio bromance
Yes it’s obviously all a big conspiracy by the nba to sabotage Anthony Edwards and not that Edwards has no idea how to drive and take contact which was a main criticism of him pre draft...
It's probably too early to say Anthony Edwards over Lamelo right?
Hey bud James Wiseman was not picked #1. That was Anthony Edwards.
Can someone post the Anthony Edwards foul replay?
love the way the commentator says Anthony Edwards  it’s spicy
"Then you should know that Rosas has consistently said that he has the Houston Rockets philosophy. Acquire assets (picks,role players,etc) and trade them for stars.  We didn't even want to draft Anthony Edwards we wanted to either trade down or star the pick for a star but no one was biting last summer."
Anthony Edwards looks like his pizza order just showed up
I feel like I’ve seen about 100 guys who look exactly like fat Anthony Edwards lol
Looney also isn’t a 19 year old stud that was picked second in the draft. Maybe Minny should sit Anthony Edwards too and not bother developing him. Great idea!
"https://www.google.ca/amp/s/ca.nba.com/amp/news/2020-nba-mock-draft-scouting-report-anthony-edwards-deni-avdija-lamelo-ball/qzgpi83ijpta1e74c5ryf3tsl  Literal NBA.com mock draft lol, didn’t take long"
Anthony Edwards.
"It's 2063, Ricky Rubio is feeling down. But suddenly, he remembers way back when, to the time Anthony Edwards praised him so highly. He smiles..."
Anthony edwards looked good tonight. He’s Been playing well and can put anyone on a poster. Or finish at the rim.  He’s crazy athletic if he can find a jumpshot he’s dangerous.
"From everything I've read about Anthony Edwards, it seems like he's got a lot of personality, a good heart and he's on the right path"
Anthony Edwards
"Anthony Edwards for entertainment purposes. Embiid actually gives pretty honest answers with breakdowns and a lot of insight, he also sometimes talks shit lol"
"Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards and Jaylen Nowell are the next NBA big 3"
You love to see it. Anthony edwards is a great player
"Non catch and shoot shots including cuts...   And those are LOW frequency for any young scorer. Compare that to even lower tier scoring young player in our league today. That frequency literally rivals that of fucking Deandre Hunter, a guy who Hawks fans would STILL say has less superstar potential than even Cam Reddish.   He’s averaging 17.2. 33.5 catch and shoot frequency. 45.3 0 dribbles frequency. Those are nearly identical to Kawhis. Like do you not realize how low those are for some of the young scorers in the league? Do you not see why those aren’t enough flashes for him to be firmly put above someone like Wiggins ?  Hunters numbers rival 2015 Kawhis. Anthony Edwards numbers are MUCH worse than rookie year Wiggins. Yet most people would still say Antman has more SUPERSTAR potential than Hunter.   Doesn’t even matter here, Zion clearly is a different breed."
"If I look at the 70 players who have played at least 1000 minutes this season, the top 15 in Def RAPTOR are:  Rudy Gobert, myles turner, Robert covington, Luguentz Dort, Fred Vanvleet, Nic Batum,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, Julius Randle, Bam adebayo , royce O'Neal, Justin holiday, Ben Simmons, Kelly oubre, DeAndre ayton  This is littered with players who are either great individual defenders, or at least do a great job playing a defensive role in a solid system (FVV, Julius Randle, for example)   Wiggins ranks 25th out of those 70 players for the record - so hes fine enough but I can't buy all this talk that hes elite on that end   Also fair to note that he is ranked 67th out of those 70 players in offensive RAPTOR , right behind Anthony Edwards. So there's that"
"At some point you need good veteran players though.  Otherwise you end up like the Wolves who have no chance at giving anthony edwards a good environment to grow in because Rubio is the only vet in the rotation , and then a bunch of 22 year olds"
I thought you were spelling UTAH weirdly because I didn’t know who the fuck that was. You should’ve just said the kid Anthony edwards killed earlier this earlier. Rip him. Sorry to that man.
"He’s not well known for most people, had a decent summer league like 2 or 3 years ago but has never really cracked a real rotation, he’s now most known for that disgusting poster Anthony Edwards gave him a last month"
Anthony Edwards could never 😤
"3s are great because they open up spacing and make the game more free flowing. But I get it, we can do better. My 3 bad ideas that I love: No more corner there’s, a lot of guys live off those short corner 3s. Screw that. I also had dudes trying to take charges instead of blocking shots. Let’s change the restricted area to the permissive area were any contact is allowed in the air. I want more blocked shots and more dudes can destroyed in the paint by miles bridges and Anthony Edwards. Can we also get a four point line about 10’ beyond the 3 point line?  Oh, and let’s keep the Elam ending."
"And vanterpool, I seriously think with this addition this could take the Timberwolves to the next level. With the synergy of Kat and D’lo, the potential of Anthony Edwards, finally a good coach. The only thing stopping this team is injuries. WOLVES FANS ARE YOU READY FOR A PLAY IN GAME IN 2023‼️‼️‼️"
&gt;Killian Haynes who hasn't looked as anything special in the games he has played also.  And Anthony Edwards....?
Anthony Edwards should be on here but he just settles for jumpers instead
"So he is a bad player because he is inefficient? TS% isn't the end-all of arguments. Most rookies are very inefficient, they need to learn their team's offensive systems, shot selection, and adjust to the nba's pace/defense. Anthony Edwards also has shit efficiency and he isn't a bust or a necessarily bad player."
"Damn, I want Anthony Edwards arms tho"
"I remember seeing the video of Lamelo with two fingers up before the warriors made their pick.  There was a thread on it on the /r/warriors.  We'd just gotten the news about Klay.  I was dejected, because I honestly thought, for about a good hour, that Ball was going to be the pick at #2.  I remember being sick to my stomach.  I made a comment in that thread, at the time, saying as much.    I couldn't be happier that the warriors passed on Ball.  Nothing against the guy, but thank goodness the team passed.  I don't know if they told Lamelo they were going to pick him, or whatever they told him.  Doesn't matter to me, they made the right pick, and that's all I really care about, at the end of the day.    I felt like, out of everyone in the draft, Lamelo had one of the top odds of winning ROY.  My top 3 list of ROY contenders before the draft were:  1) Obi Toppin - I legit thought his rookie year would be fantastic.    2) Lamelo Ball - I was sure he would be good right away.  3) Tyrese Haliburton - he was always going to get off to a fast NBA start.  The things I felt about the 3 guys I had on the ROY leader board was they all shared a common trait: very advanced skill level for their age, which should facilitate immediate contribution, and a lack of the rawness that could hold them back early in their career.    However, as we move out of the rookie year, and onto season 2, season 3, and onwards in their careers, talent has a way of always dominating the equation as time goes on.    Now that I've seen Anthony Edwards play a lot in the NBA, the best comparison I can make for him is a young Russell Westbrook.  Edwards has 98 percentile NBA athletic traits, and his peak years, once he figures out what he's doing, will be Westbrook-eque.    Now that I've seen more of Patrick Williams, I see his NBA comp as Paul George.  Despite being 1 year younger than George was as a rookie, Williams' stats are better across the board than George's were.  I think he's going to grow into a really great 2-way wing in the NBA, and I'm bullish on his career, and was before the draft (Williams was my #3 overall prospect).  If the choice was Williams or Ball, I'd have drafted Williams.    I've seen every NBA minute James Wiseman has played, as a warriors fan, and he's exactly what I thought he would be: all the talent in the world, advanced as far as skill level goes (shooting, dribbling, the kind of things you can work on by yourself in a gym), but very raw as far as concepts go (the kind of stuff you learn playing high-level organized basketball).  He still doesn't know where to be on offense, he still gets in the way of his teammates sometimes, and he still shows lack of awareness on defense.  It's not that he's not hard working, it's that he just doesn't know.    Right before the all-star break, there was a play (forget the opponent) when Wiseman was camped out in the paint, and big had the ball right in front of him, the big whipped the ball out to the perimeter, and the perimeter guy whipped the ball to a backdoor cut to the basket.  Wiseman didn't turn and contest the shot, because he didn't know what the rotation was, what his responsibility was, and what he was supposed to do.  If he turns to contest the shot, the cutter passes to the big who is Wiseman's man and it's an easy dunk, if he stays with his man, the cutter gets an easy layup.  He doesn't know where his help is, and he doesn't know what the right play is.    That's not lack of defensive awareness, it's lack of not playing NBA basketball very much.  It will get better in time.  That's why Wiseman's ceiling is so high.    Lamelo doesn't have those issues.  He already knows the NBA game, already knows where to be, and already knows what to do.  That makes him better right now, but he has a lower ceiling."
lol you have no idea what you are talking about. Russ may have averaged a few assist but that was just because he had KfreakingD.  Coming out of UCLA and even throughout his rookie season Russ played a lot of shooting guard because he was not a good playmaker and was a guy that only put the ball in the bucket. Similar to Collin Sexton or...get this.... *Anthony Edwards*.
i think ur just projecting since Anthony Edwards almost single handedly beat you guys yesterday lmao
No you're not I have a better chance of becoming a doctor than Anthony Edwards ever becoming a top 5 player. You're delusional if you think otherwise.
"No  ANTHONY EDWARDS, ANTHONY BENNET 2.0"
Halliburton has a nice all around game but I trust Edwards on the perimeter more. Yesterday head to head against Lebron James is everything you need to know about Anthony Edwards. Wait untill he thins out and starts taking his craft serious. Kid is stupid athletic he could be modern day Bo Jackson or Deion Sanders
I’ve never said that these guys would be studs al I said was that they could play professional sports. Anthony Edwards started playing basketball as a sophomore in high school and he’s a 99% percentile athlete. IQ and skill set have a lot to do with it but even then guys like Curry are freaks of nature. Curry can get his heartbeat under 80 bpm in 2 minutes and leads his team on lifting. Calvin Johnson was going to play baseball at Georgia tech but his mom denied him. Kyler Murray is a 99th percentile athlete being drafted in the first round of the MLB and NFL.
that’s future lion owner Anthony Edwards to you
Anthony Edwards is better than Lamelo Ball.
"Year 2 Wade was 23, and his team mate finished runner up for MVP.   Considering Anthony Edwards is 19, you should give him more time before you say what he can’t do."
"Yeah, he's an elite-level role player or 3rd/4th star, but not the kind of guy that can single-handedly change the trajectory of a franchise.  On the other hand, Anthony Edwards shows some early signs of being a guy like that.  He's pretty impressive so far."
ANTHONY EDWARDS WITH A THREE IN LEBRONS MOUTH  srsly wtf is wrong with this sub's hate boner for LeBron
"Listen, I don't want much in life. But if Anthony Edwards becomes a superstar on the Wolves, I die happy."
All i see are posts praising anthony edwards. The only overreaction i see is yours
ANTHONY EDWARDS DRAINS A 3 IN LEBRON'S *FACE* (thousands of upvotes)  LEBRON BREAKS *HIS OWN ANKLES* (thousands of upvotes)  Lakers win the game/LeBron drops 30/LeBron triple double (300 upvotes)
Dlo. I guess Anthony Edwards too but he's a rookie so its expected.
Anthony Edwards seems to be having fun.
He's that Zach Lavine/Donovan Mitchell/Anthony Edwards type of SG. Probably a top 5 pick in this draft.   Athletic high volume scorer who can shoot and slash.  Biggest questions will be defense and efficiency in the NBA.
"Anthony Edwards is really good too, he's just stuck on a pretty bad team.   Super athletic and quick, has potential to become a good shooter, really fun to watch"
Anthony edwards another solid game! He's quietly been very good
"Anthony Edwards has potential to an elite two way player. Perhaps won't be as flashy or creative as Lamelo, but I believe he has just as high a ceiling. It's rare to see teenage SGs that are already so physically developed. Dude is already like 225, he is built like a wide receiver. Strong, quick and explosive. He is so smooth too and has a calmness to the way he plays. You can see the raw talent, just needs to polish his technique and gain experience."
what about the rookie literally averaging the most points? this sub severely underrates Anthony Edwards.
"I think Anthony Edwards is a hell of a talent, just with a shit coach. Wiseman is raw, but LaMelo alone is making this draft hella special.   Throw in the gems of Halliburton, Pritchard and Quickley and this draft class is still super special."
"KAT, DLo, Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, Jarred Vanderbilt and Jordan McLaughlin  That would leave out: Rubio, Culver, Okogie, Hernangomez, Nowell, Layman, Davis  I would hope then that Rubio and Hernangomez get picked up"
"Anthony Edwards started playing basketball late.   Lamelo has been playing basketball all his life.   Athletically, Anthony Edwards is like slightly below D Wade.    If he puts it together, he will be way better than current Bradley Beal"
Anthony edwards reminds me of wiggins with a bit of mitchell.
"They have Anthony Edwards, that is a really good pick. Lamelo is close to his ceiling when compared to Edwards.   Rosas is only given excuses, because he came from the Morey tree.   He doesn't know what he is doing.  look at the grizzlies, that new management came in, hired a new coach, drafted right, BROUGHT IN VETS, and they have a true culture. They have a lot of competitive players and their front office LOVES it.   Look at the Suns,James Jones chose a new coach/coaching staff, chose players that complement what the coach wants, BROUGHT IN VETS (baynes/dario/rubio) with trust. And established a culture. Competitive  You gotta let the vets feel at home, if they are passing through, then they can't do much for the culture."
"I think those top three picks were interchangeable at the time and it depended on what the team thought it needed.  There is no way anyone could have predicted how insanely good Lamelo would be, and it isn't like Wiseman or Edwards is Anthony Bennett.  Both of those guys are playing well."
"Anthony Edwards seems pretty good.  As good as LaMelo has been, people might want to calm down a little bit on saying the Wolves fucked up by taking Edwards."
"&gt; Yes, it's still early, but it's still safe to say that Ball should've been drafted No. 1 overall, and it shouldn't have been particularly close. That's not a knock on Anthony Edwards or James Wiseman who are having solid rookie campaigns, but what Ball has been doing this season is ridiculous. What's even more ridiculous is he's been doing most of his damage off the bench, as it wasn't until the past two weeks that he got pushed into the starting lineup due to injuries. In the six games he's started, he's averaging over 21 points a game, six assists and five boards.   I haven’t caught too many Hornets games but he seems to be doing really well."
If Anthony Edwards had those metrics though it wouldn't be as annoying ;)
Edwards combine statistics were off the charts and he looks bigger than some 30 years old in the NBA so athletically you can't compare Lamelo and Anthony.
A ton of analysts viewed Wiseman or Anthony Edwards as the #1 also.  https://ca.nba.com/news/nba-draft-2020-mock-draft--who-will-be-the-no-1-overall-pick-anthony-edwards-lamelo-ball-james-wiseman/fzjr07j7twd5190ibt14yhz4g
Pretty much any rookie is. For the first 15 games or so any time Anthony Edwards checked in the opposing team went on a run.
Anthony Edwards over LaMelo Ball will eventually be part of that to some extent
and Anthony Edwards is sitting a couple spots below him a -1.2
"Edwards projects to be an athletic 6'4 slasher and scorer which is great but give me the 6'7 point guard that projects to be a scorer, rebounder and playmaker for the entire team. LaMelo Ball's potential is higher then Anthony Edwards and it's not hard to see why, Edwards will never have LaMelo's ability to pass and run the offense."
1  Haliburton  Ball  Quickley  Wiseman  PWilliams  &amp;#x200B;  2  Maledon  Pritchard  Edwards  Anthony  Bane

Lamelo/Haliburton/Edwards/Williams/Wiseman   Anthony/Quickley/Tate/Okoro/Tillman
I need someone to explain to me how anthony Edwards right now is better then deandre ayton
"Boy, are you wrong. You pray that Anthony Edwards ends up at some point getting close to 37 year old LeBron. Think of it as drafting a 2 year championship window."
No? I’m not taking a 37 year old over someone like Anthony Edwards
Anthony edwards
"Depending on our level of play once kat returns and if we keep our pick we traded to gs (only a 40% chance if we finish bottom 3) trading kat is an interesting thought exercise. Its starting to become inevitable at this point and seeing some of the recent hauls for superstars (imo) you gotta wonder what a rebuild around anthony edwards, malik beasley and say cade cunningham and assets from kat and probably dlo would look like"
"His shot motion is janky af but it’s always looked really smooth coming off his hand. Good rotation, effortless power, great feel.  I compare it in my head to Anthony Edwards early in the season, who has a textbook jumper form but who’s J looked stiff and without much feel, especially early in the season. Edwards’ shot is looking better now, but just something I was noticing."
"is it just me or would i rather have rookie anthony edwards than rookie zion  idk maybe its because mavs always play zion well but i feel like anthony edwards is better as a well-rounded player...and also not as round  obviously hes not as strong or quite as explosive but he's not that far from zion. when do wolves and pelicans play next, i really want to see them head to head"
"Anthony Edwards thoughts after watching for one game.  Defense and Rebounding wise, I can't say I was super dialed in to see how he boxed out or gave help or anything. Most I can say in both of these categories is that there was more a lack of horrible mistakes than there was a presence of positive plays. He doesn't really move the needle in either of those areas one way or the other.   Offensively he got 4 assists but I couldn't tell you that he was a great passer after watching this game. For comparison, Porzingis had 4 assists but I thought his playmaking left a lot to be desired. As a scorer he has a pretty good shot distribution. A whole lot from the paint and the 3 point line.   Unfortunately his actual shot selection is pretty bad. He routinely chose to drive straight at help defenders, particularly in the first half. Getting to the paint is good, but just challenging the 7'3"" guy over and over again is a bad idea. He was getting a bit of rookie treatment from the refs and doesn't really have a foul-drawing craftiness to him so he ended up just getting repeatedly stuffed at the rim."
It was basically Anthony Edwards and Beasley vs Mavericks.
Anthony Bennett played like 10 minutes a game and had a bunch of DNPs .  Im not saying Edwards would be there but 15 min a night on most teams is what you'd see .
"which time?? In the last 12 years they've had the up and coming spooky teams of:   * 2007-2009: Al Jefferson, Sebastian Telfair, Corey Brewer * 2010-2014: Kevin Love, Derrick Williams and Ricky Rubio * 2015-2019: Andrew Wiggins, KAT, Zach Lavine * 2020-Present: KAT, D'lo Russell, Anthony Edwards"
I bet Charlotte would’ve loved get Anthony edwards!
Anthony Edwards and Andrew Wiggins are the best iso scorers of all time right now per NBA’s tracking data right now.
"What happened to Anthony ""99%er"" Edwards?"
"Can't believe I have to do this, but I'll draw it out. Here are 99 o's, and 1 i  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooi  If Anthony Edwards is part of the 99th percentile, he is grouped amongst the same level that 99 of the o's are in. The singular i is the 1% that is outside that range, whether it be bad or good. In this case it's a good thing, with his iso scoring. I did a statistics course in college, I don't understand how no one agrees with me"
"I think Patrick White (bias bulls fan) however he seems to have his head on right and the physical body to get there. The rest is on him. James Wisemen is also in the perfect system. I think they will be the great ones but you also have Anthony Edwards, precious, quickley and Maxey who have all shown flashes. The year is still young and the guys are still young but I think a lot of them have kicked into great positions to start there career. Now we wait and see."
Not one. Anthony Edwards is as talented as anyone who came into the NBA at his position and he's probably the worst player in the NBA getting bigger minutes. The NBA is HARD!
Anthony Edwards on their bench rn
"This idea is really, really, really dumb.  &gt;  I believe this should be a scenario where the Warriors should look to trade multiple draft picks for a more proven young player  &gt; RJ Barrett (4/4), Lamelo Ball (4/4), Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Halliburton  We should trade four first round draft picks, including a potential top 5 pick, for RJ Barrett or Lamelo Ball? Why? So the idea is to mortgage our future for players who don't really help us in the short term..?"
Was referring to Anthony Edwards and his 37% fg
I can totally understand LaMelo winning ROY and personally I have a hard time saying who has been better. What I don't understand or like is people deciding they have to shit on Anthony Edwards at every opportunity because they picked LaMelo. It just results in some terrible takes that make people sound like they haven't watched basketball
"it's a damm crime against nature that Anthony Edwards isn't hooping in the ATL smh, that'd for sure make your views go up"
Karl-Anthony Towns and D’Angelo Russell played exactly 21 minutes together in the first half of the season. Of course we were terrible.   In the 24 games they actually played together (with Edwards) we were 13-11.
"I was talking about the season as a whole, but when both are healthy, Lamelo &gt; Anthony Edwards"
"Yep, the Cade Cunningham / Anthony Edwards Eastern Conference powerhouse Minnesota Timberwolf dynasty is shaping up quite well.   ...in my wildest dreams."
We wish we were Anthony Edwards but we’re really Jimmer
"All of your players were also playing losing basketball without AD and LeBron. Funny how that works.  Also yeah you certainly wouldn't want KAT,Anthony Edwards or D'lo on the Lakers not you whatsoever lmao"
"The cult of Anthony Edwards came from him absolutely flipping a switch and looking like a future superstar post-ASB. Also he's just a fun dude. LaMelo is great too. I thinking ppl are just getting a little too swept up in ROY politics. Regardless of who ends up winning the award, we have two potential superstars to watch grow over the coming years so we're the real winners in all of this."
Lol these aren’t cherry picked though.   Outside of 21 straight games LaMelo was not that great and that’s the same thing people say about Anthony Edwards.   This is LaMelo’s first third of the season with his end stat averages.   I’m using the same logic.  So how are you gonna tell me we can discredit Edwards like that but not LaMelo? That’s cherry picking.
Yeah no shit they're veterans with 30+mil contracts the fact that Lamelo brought so much to the table as a rookie is why it's so impressive. Anthony Edwards was also extremely impressive in the second half of the season though dont get me wrong
Anthony Edwards
"My argument for this is look at their quality of team mates.   LaMelo is on a team that made it to the playing games. He largely played most of his time in the NBA with Rozier, Graham, Hayward, Washington, Bridges. He then got injured and a bunch when he came back some guys were gone and he wasn’t as good.   Anthony Edwards in the other hand played every game this year, and KAT, Beasley, and Russell combined missed 87 games. The next best players on the Wolves are Rubio, McDaniels, Okogie, Reid.   The level of talent around them doesn’t compare. And Ant was the #1 guy on the scouting report for multiple games."
Anthony Edwards better not get snubbed for ROTY
"Anthony Edwards is ROTY, this is a joke. You can argue all you want but I dont think its particularly a debate anymore."
"lol if Zion couldn't win ROTY due to extended injury absence, there's no way Lamelo, who played worse than Anthony Edwards to begin with, will."
"Anthony Edwards has had way huger flashes, and lamelos per game numbers aren't *that* much better than Edwards' so I'll take Edwards because I like that he's had more huge games"
"Zach arguement for LaMelo:   I've heard from partisans of both Ball and Edwards suggesting the race is a blowout. Nope. Advanced numbers suggest a blowout -- for Ball. Edwards is 12th among 34 rotation rookies in PER, 26th in value over replacement player, and 29th in win shares. Ball is first, second, and ninth, respectively.  Those numbers penalize Edwards for taking tons of shots on a losing team, and hitting them at a poor rate (41% overall, 32.7% on 3s, 48% on 2s) -- and playing the bad defense we expect from rookies. They say Edwards' impressive traditional numbers are empty calories. There is a sound argument that Haliburton should finish No. 2.  But what would happen to basically any rookie working as a pseudo-No. 1 option for the Minnesota freaking Timberwolves without both Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell? That was Edwards' lot early -- when he missed and missed and missed, and his advanced numbers sunk into the abyss.  But alongside real talent, Edwards has exceeded expectations. In 35 games since March 1, he's averaging 23 points on 45% shooting: a semi-respectable (considering how many pull-ups he takes) 34% on 3s, and 53.3% on 2s. The Wolves are 15-19 in that stretch, and 9-7 in their past 16 games. They are a real team, and Edwards is part of that. You can tell he has earned the respect of opponents, because they often assign their best perimeter defenders to him.  Edwards leads all rookies in minutes, with about 800 more than Ball. He may unseat Ball, the presumptive favorite all season, and that would not be some sort of travesty. But Ball has made positive contributions to a team with real stakes since day one. He has been the better shooter, playmaker, and rebounder. His statistical edge in everything but raw points and minutes is overwhelming. Given some baseline threshold of availability, I don't prioritize minutes quite as much in the ""of year"" awards as in MVP. Ball wins here, but it's close. Haliburton is an easy choice at No. 3."
Anthony Edwards drops an efficient game high 30 and gets left off the list. 🤔
Highest pull-up 3P% since the All-Star break (min &gt;50 3PM):  40.6 — Steph Curry  38.8 — Damian Lillard  38.7 — Anthony Edwards
"It's just salt. OP posts obsessively about Anthony Edwards and the T-Wolves, and the writer of this article voted for LaMelo over Edwards in ROTY."
Anthony Edwards gets an easy ROTY
"But has LaMelo been really good all season? In the last 10 games Ball has a +/- of -44, shot 38.4% from the field, 24.4% from three and 66.7% from the charity stripe.  That being said (even as a Timberwolves fan) I think LaMelo had the better season overall. Edwards was particularly bad at the beginning of the season, and that's okay. As advertised, Edwards was a really raw rookie with an incredible amount of room for improvement.    Importantly, Edwards \*did\* improve every single month this season. That's something you love to see in a rookie.  Everyone likes to compare his numbers pre and post all-star break, but even before the break you can see Edwards consistently get better over time.   Ask yourself this, if we did the 2020 draft over today, who would you want to take at No.1 for the future of your franchise? With 0 reservations I'm picking Anthony Edwards."
"ROTY is Anthony Edwards not Lamelo Ball lol, and you can fight me however you want."
"I disagree, you have to think about how good a rookie was doing over the course of the season, Anthony Edwards struggled in the beginning while lamelo flourished even with a lesser role and he still is despite missing time with a wrist injury Melo for roty"
You're right if LaMelo wins ROTY over Anthony Edwards then that is the wrong choice
"That’s valid but if we rank the halves of the year. In first place is Anthony Edwards second half, in second place is lamelos first half. Both of those halves were amazing where they both played at a close to all star level. Third place is ANTs inefficient first half and in last place is lamelos half where he played ten games lost seven of them and missed the rest. Plus it’s not how you start it’s how you finish"

But that's not an excuse for chemistry being ruined for ""multiple seasons"" your top paid star is supposed to set the tone as far as team chemistry. attitude reflects leadership. Right now I think Anthony Edwards has more qualities to lead a locker than KAT. and he's young and immature as hell. And that speaks volumes about Kat"
Anthony Edwards is really doing it
"Somehow him coming back and shitting the bed has helped strengthen his rookie of the year case. Meanwhile, Anthony Edwards is averaging 26.6 points on on 65.5 TS% this month."

Anthony edwards
"Shai and MPJ are far from the worst lol  Probably Anthony Edwards or Lamelo Ball if we can just use rookies, but that’s kind of unfair lol.  Maybe like KPJ?"
"You know what, I have a another suggestion for you.    Anthony Edwards and LaMelo Ball are 2 rookies that are sure thing future all stars.   Watch their highlights and then watch how they grow next year.   I think that’s actually going to help you learn the game, seeing them make big improvements.  Maybe one of them regresses as the league adjusts to how they defend them.  That kind of thing happens to young players and teaches you a lot."
"Points of interest from my perspective for a new fan:  Steph Curry’s 3 point craziness.  Jokic’s passing/facilitating.  Anthony Edwards crazy dunks and hilarious interviews.  Utah and Phoenix as newly ascended top 2 teams.  Playoff LeBron James.  The big 3 in the East (Milwaukee, Philly, and Brooklyn).    Those have been a lot of fun to watch."
"It doesn't make Minny look good, but the element of luck for you to land him.  He was supposedly not interested in Minnesota, and he didn't try out with us.  Jonny Flynn had a great Tournament run (also remember we had an insanely incompetent GM in David Kahn, who was someone who wanted to make a splash, and thought Rubio was that splash).    We also had our GM/Coach DIE on us shortly after drafting KAT.  Who knows what Flip could have done with Wiggins/LaVine/Towns  Absolutely agree with you on the last part.  How can we as a fan base trust anything any management does after something like that, though!  We've been pretty lucky with Rosas gnabbing Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels, and Leandro Bolmaro in this years draft.  I truly think we as a roster currently constructed without those players would have been doomed.  Now we got to make sure we build with these 3 at the forefront.  I am a Minny fan that doesn't think KAT is a first option yet, and probably will never be."
He has Anthony Edwards and Dlo and he used to have Jimmy Butler. The Timberwolves have had a good roster for the past few years
Unbiased opinion  MVP - KAT  DPOY - Josh Okogie  ROTY - Anthony Edwards  6MOY - D’Angelo Russell (He’s been coming off the bench for the past few weeks)  MIP - Jaylen Nowell  COTY - Chris Finch  EOTY - Gersson Rosas   What do you guys think?
Anthony Edwards has some of my favorite interviews ever and he is a rookie.
"In terms of quality, Dame  In terms of entertainment, Anthony Edwards"
Anthony Edwards
"&gt;VIII) The easy fixes for Anthony Edwards  I continue to be bullish on Edwards. His growing chemistry with Karl-Anthony Towns has been one of the joys of the past two months -- how they bob and weave in concert, faking a handoff one way before flipping it the other direction. The return of D'Angelo Russell has interrupted that development a tad, but talent is talent, and the Wolves need all they can get.  Minnesota is 6-6 with Russell and Towns available. Josh Okogie rediscovered his confidence from deep, though we know how that movie usually ends. Jaden McDaniels is legit; the Okogie/McDaniels pairing is the type of defensive bulwark the Russell/Edwards/Towns nucleus needs, though I'm skeptical it brings enough shooting.  Meanwhile, Malik Beasley and his 20 points per game are missing; the Russell/Beasley/Towns/Edwards quartet has logged just 13 minutes. Such bad luck could only befall the Wolves.  Minus his nightly steal, Edwards has been bad on defense -- as expected for a teenager. It takes time for score-first guys to learn the complexities of NBA schemes. Barring some lack of will, Edwards should become at least an average defender.  He can start with the low-hanging fruit of transition defense. Minnesota is as bad there as the Kings, and way worse with Edwards on the floor -- in both volume of transition chances and opponent efficiency, per Cleaning The Glass data.  Edwards can be slow to realize when he should ditch his matchup and take the closest opposing player:  He sometimes meanders toward the offensive glass -- too halfhearted to count as ""crashing"" -- when he has little chance at a rebound. Edwards has 47 offensive rebounds in 60 games, so the risk-reward is not working.  Ambling cuts to nowhere can undo Minnesota's floor balance:  Edwards has good intentions: making himself available for the corner-to-corner pass. But Naz Reid -- having a very nice season! -- is already there, with two other Wolves under the basket.  This is fixable with experience and care. If we are having this same discussion in two years, it's a problem."
Anthony edwards is looking good though!
"Obviously biased, but Anthony Edwards smile always makes me grin."
Our wolves play by play guy spews random facts about ants every time Anthony Edwards does something exciting.  Probably not what you’re looking for but it’s collectively been the best bit in the NBA this year.
"They need to find a coach to turn this around. Anthony Edwards needs to not develop bad habits because he has minimum allstar potential, maybe superstar potential."
Does Anthony Edwards count?
I'd like to add... checks games played... Anthony Edwards to the ballot.
&gt; why is Anthony Edwards the ROTY favorite?   Because LaMelo's not playing right now
"Wiseman has 836 minutes total for his season most of them bad. Anthony Edwards has 800+ minutes since the all star break on a ts% of 53%, over that same time frame he's also 3rd in total points in the 4th quarter behind only Fox and Westbrook. Pretty good for a 19 year old. Look I know it's probably too much to ask to have you sit down and actually watch basketball before spouting off because Ant is kinda nice right now and anyone who is willing to sit down and watch basketball as opposed to refreshing bball reference and talking about advanced stats that they barely understand, can see Ant is playing really good right now."
Anthony Edwards
"James Wiseman has played at most a total of thirty games because of injury and suspension the last two years. He had a wrist fracture and meniscus injuries in a shortened season. He has played basketball for maybe four or five years. He had a hard time catching the 🏀. Golden State knew he was a long-term project, and drafted him anyway.   With all these things, if the number one pick isn't the Rookie of the Year, I would be disappointed if I was Minnesota. Anthony Edwards is a fully developed man with some basketball skills. The difference between playing forty and eighty games with the most skilled players in the world, there will be a learning curve for all rookies. Not everyone can dominate the first year like Micheal Jordan did.  If Wiseman hasn't developed a zero +-  player rating by the third year, I would be disappointed if I were the Warriors."
"I thought you were comparing Wiseman and Edwards, what does Haliburton have to do with that? Oh, I just saw your user name, it's you- You're still shit posting about Anthony Edwards everywhere"
LaMelo is the ROTY so this really doesn’t matter  And this is coming for a honest Anthony Edwards and James Weisman fan
If you gave me that quote out of context I’d 100% think Anthony Edwards said it lol
I do like the Kings with Fox    Anthony Edwards is a promising rookie
Anthony Edwards furious
Anthony Edwards is good
"Yeah, i just look it up and Anthony Edwards has a higher TS, just for 0.2 but still higher lol"
At this point the only reason I watch is because whenever Anthony Edwards does something cool one of our announcers gives an obscure fact about ants.
"I think if he isn’t even close to the same level he was at the start and Anthony Edwards - who is the only other rookie in the running - plays well for the remainder of the season, I can see LaMelo no longer being the favorite."
Anthony “I don’t know who A-Rod is” Edwards has been killing it his athleticism is off the charts he’s so fun to watch.
"Anthony Edwards, together with KAT, will become dangerous in 3-4 years if they surround themselves with great pieces. This kid is a future star in the making. I think he might bring home the rookie of the year."

"Lamelo was obviously leading in roy im not debating that, but why do people always use winning in the argument when it doesnt work for a roy race and definitely doesnt work in this case as the hornets kept winning without him and only started to lose when hayward also went out and their still not bad so lamelo wasnt making his team win. Also it doesnt work in the roy race because the best rookies are supposed to be on the worst teams. Anthony edwards season is also way better than people make it out to be. And lamelo was worse than people make it out to be. Lamelo was leading by a landslide when he was playing but anthony edwards started to play way better when lamelo got injured. And lamelo wasnt so much better when he was healthy than anthony edwards now to just completely disregard the amount of games played."

"Mine is:             Lamelo, edwards, haliburton, bey, Tate first team  Quickley, cole Anthony, Patrick Williams, bane, Stewart second team"
Anthony Edwards and Speedhawk: Separated at Birth
"I'd say it's because the Rookie race wasn't nearly as close as the MVP race, nor does it really carry the same weight in terms of prestige.  Anthony Edwards didn't start looking good until the second half of the season, Haliburton has kind of cooled off from the hot start he had, and I can't see an argument for anyone else in the class. Lamelo has clearly been a step above the other rookies this season.  Meanwhile, Embiid and Jokic were both neck and neck for MVP, and LeBron being LeBron and doing LeBron things will always be included in some way."
"Legit thought it was Anthony Edwards as Goose at first. Like, who cares if Goose knows A-Rod."
Anthony Edwards is now one of my favourite players
"Anthony ""basketball, football, &amp; baseball player"" Edwards"
I dunno Anthony Edwards looks pretty good so far
Anthony Edwards is already the funniest dude in the NBA.
A-Rod let alone the rest of us do not deserve Anthony Edwards
"In a world of pre-canned approved answers, just showing up and saying what comes to mind, will make him a radical, chosen to bring truth to the masses, by simply being himself, showing the people how to be themselves instead of the person they think the world wants them to be, he will free their minds, the true third eye opener of the NBA, the slayer of fake vibes-- Anthony Edwards"
"As a Blazers fan I didn't realize Anthony Edwards true greatness until watching him play the Blazers. He balled out but I knew he was destined for greatness when he hit a step back three on Melo and gave him the three to the dome celebration right in Melo's face, just smirking the entire time  Shit was incredible and hilarious. Even Melo couldn't help but laugh"
Anthony Edwards would move the 2K storyline to all new heights.   I feel he would be psyched to do it and still deliver a good bad performance.
Anthony Edwards (thinks A-Rod would be happier with J-Lo) expects to play against kings.
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Anthony Edwards. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Ant's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Anthony Edwards truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in A1's existential catchphrase ""I like your accent. I want to learn how to talk like that"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the rookie's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂  And yes, by the way, i DO have an Anthony Edwards tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"
I want the actor Anthony Edwards to play the basketball player Anthony Edwards in a reading of these conversations.
Anthony “Aroldis Chapman” Edwards
"Who says things matters a lot. Everyone knows Anthony Edwards is a goofy kid, Ben Simmons not so much"
I find it funny that I don't know who Anthony Edwards is and was thinking this was the actor from ER lol and Top Gun this whole time
"[PBP Stats lets you look at Low Leverage possessions, aka garbage time](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/player?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;Leverage=Low)   **Top 5 players with the most points scored during garbage time**   Anthony Edwards - 180   Donovan Mitchell - 134   Nikola Vucevic - 132   Stephen Curry - 129   Zach Lavine - 128"
"Anthony Edwards is the guy from Top Gun, right?"
"Garbage defenses have been carried by insane offenses lead by superstars into decent playoff runs over the years  What's KAT done so far, seeing as he's somehow such a legendary offensive center because he's a great shooter? A big more skilled than Jokic has achieved getting Anthony Edwards"
"I meant that Anthony Edwards’ responses and general attitude in interviews are going to become memes on this sub, just like Evan turners were"
Anthony Edwards in a few years. Only diff is he says everything out loud which makes it even better
"Pretty great interview of nothing but Anthony Edwards talking about his alleged upcoming EP with Lil Baby, A-Rod’s love life, his belief that he can throw a fastball 100 MPH, and why he looks up to Jimmy Butler and Allen Iverson"
Anthony Edwards has more potential to be a #1 for a team so he can talk himself up more then 12 PPG Simmons
"Yeah he's definitely capitalising. Even now, it's still a hard sell trying to convince me Anthony Edwards or Tyrese Haliburton deserves it over LaMelo.  Secure your shit Melo!"
"Paul's rhetoric will change after Anthony Edwards scores a ""bad dunk"" on him"
First year player Anthony Edwards of the last place Minnesota Timberwolves has the same arrogance yet this sub thinks it's endearing
"Yuta shows great hustle on the court whenever he's on the floor he never ever gives up he's honestly a future dpoy winner I hate that the dunk by anthony Edwards who is an inefficient shot chucker who hates basketball was posted around the internet what was missed on that play by these casuals and nephews was the hustle and heart by yuta, it's stupid how Edwards was celebrated but yuta didn't get praised for his contest this dirty basketball culture should change we should celebrate the defenders even if he's scored on matter of fact we should throw wins or losses out the window and give everyone an applause."
"His baptism, courtesy of Anthony Edwards, is now worth it."
Yuta should buy Anthony Edwards dunk NFT and sell it to him as revenge
"""ANTHONY EDWARDS!!!"""
"I wouldn't be too upset if I were a Wolves fan. I mean, they might get Cade Cunningham or Jalen Suggs after this season. Idk who they move to make the roster work but Cunningham/Suggs with Anthony Edwards, KAT, D'Lo and Beasley is a solid crop of talent and decent assets to assemble a squad.   If this don't work out though, yeah, I'd be fucking pissed."
"       Nets = Bad Guys. Harden tanking his value to go to the Nets. Nets big 3; Kyrie, KD, Harden. Can the Lakers run it back? When are Lebron and AD coming back? Embiid and Jokic for MVP. Two Centers being front runners for MVP. Utah Jazz first seed, are they contenders? Does Chris Paul make the Suns contenders? PG redemption season? Clippers redemption season? Batum greatest player of all time (yes).         The Celtics? The Heat? Giannis remain long term with Bucks. Pressure on Giannis to perform in the playoffs. Bud on the hot seat. The future of Simmons and Embiid? Curry man, so inspirational. Luka magic! Zion! Knicks not a complete dumpster fire! Timberwolves still a complete dumpster fire! Westbrook is washed? Westbrook is not washed?        Is a shortened season causing more injuries to players. The West is loaded; Lakers, Clippers, Jazz, Suns, Nuggets. The East being top heavy; Bucks, Nets, Sixers.         Big trades at the deadline for playoffs teams Rondo to Clips, AG to Nugs, Powell to Trailblazers, Oladipo to Heat. Drummond signed by the Lakers. Raptors keep Lowry at the deadline?!?        Thyrese Haliburton, Anthony Edwards, Lamelo Ball great rookies to watch out for."
"Think of it like a baseball card. The photo on the card isn’t exclusive to the card but the card itself is a collector’s item.  If Anthony Edwards becomes an NBA legend, someone might want this moment for even more.... lots of ifs on the last part, who knows if anyone will care in 20 years."
Anthony Edwards is what Andrew Wiggins was supposed to be.

"My point still stands, and I would say the same about KAT and Anthony Edwards. With at least two supposedly really good players, Minny can won’t more games?!? Why is it my Pistons and the Wizards can?"
*Anthony Edwards nervously looks around...*
Anthony Edwards is the best I’ve seen.
Unbiased take:  1. Malik Beasley 2. Anthony Edwards 3. Jaylen Nowell 4. Zach LaVine 5. Malik Beasley again
"Even with improvements, Anthony Edwards is a high-volume inefficient brick layer. Same argument.  Point is, progress is being made. Thibs isn’t a perfect coach, he has his flaws. This team, despite their shooting percentage, has limited three-point shooting. They shoot the right shots rather than more shots, which is fine for year 1. Once we sign more shooters and playmakers, expect the attempts to increase. I honestly think you’re being a hater. Every Knicks thread, you’re here to bash the Knicks and whatever they are doing. Maybe you’re just jealous that you’re dumpster fire franchise can’t seem to ever get it done. Tough luck man."
&gt;You’re also the guy who used a 20 game sample size to try to prove Anthony Edwards is better than RJ Barrett. Now all of a sudden it’s too low? Be consistent man.   How does your argument make sense? Even with improvements you are still below average in 3 point attempts and that's the entire point. And yeah he's better and it will be clear by the end of the season lol
You’re also the guy who used a 20 game sample size to try to prove Anthony Edwards is better than RJ Barrett. Now all of a sudden it’s too low? Be consistent man.
Anthony Edwards awoke something in us
he moves like Anthony Edwards but 285.. beast.
Anthony Edwards. He was always talked about someone who has the tools to be a good defender and needs to improve on his shot selection. And all of those predictions were true.  If he was playing like this since December we'd be looking at a different team.
Are we talking about anthony edwards or deni avdija?
"I see his VORP as 0.7 which actually ranks him in the top 113 out of 524 total players.  Anthony Edwards ranks 519 out of 524 which is interesting. The only players below him are Sekou Doumbouya, Isaac Okoro, Dwayne Bacon, Rodney Hood, and Theo Maledon."
I’m pretty sure Anthony Edwards is Goose
Oh okay I see what you mean. I think there are times when some players struggle mentally with what their responsibilities are and that can come off as lazy when its actually that there is too much being asked of them by their coaches and whatever system they are running. Anthony Edwards might be a good example- when he is lost on defense it isnt as much as an effort issue as it is his undeveloped understanding of the game. So I am inclined to agree.
Yeah my man is thinking he's Anthony Edwards.
Anthony Edwards will remain on the Timberwolves next year
"Anthony edwards is goku, towns is vegeta"
KAT and Anthony Edwards need to quit taking so many shots and stunting Jarrett Culver’s development smh
Anthony Edwards is already a walking quote.
"James Harden, Anthony Edwards, Tobias Harris"
He looks like Miles Bridges and Anthony Edwards
"&gt;Why?   MINNEAPOLIS -- — Karl-Anthony Towns scored 24 points, including eight in the fourth quarter before fouling out, to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 119-111 win against the Miami Heat on Friday night.  Ricky Rubio added 17 points and Naz Reid scored 16 off the bench as Minnesota had seven players score in double-figures to overcome 21 turnovers. Towns keyed a 22-6 run midway through the fourth as the Timberwolves pulled away.  Towns missed the past two games due to personal reasons on the one-year anniversary of his mother’s death. Minnesota lost both games by at least 25 points to Brooklyn and Milwaukee. Against another Eastern Conference playoff contender, the Timberwolves finished strong to win for just the second time in six games, a stretch against all East teams.  “This win meant a lot to me, just being able to do what I love and be able to be on the court with these guys,” Towns said.  Jimmy Butler had 30 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, but Miami lost its third straight game, all coming on the road. Trevor Ariza scored a season-high 21 points for the Heat, who started the night seventh in the East and a half-game ahead of Charlotte.  “We don’t deserve to win,” Butler said. “Whenever we take these teams lightly, we don’t do what we’re supposed to do on the defensive end, we just look bad as a whole, as a group, as a unit. It’s not good basketball.”  Miami appeared ready to put away the Wolves, the West’s worst team at the start of the day. The Heat finished the third quarter on a 15-5 and led by five points with Goran Dragic hitting a buzzer-beating 3-pointer.  Towns didn’t let Minnesota fade away. He finished the pivotal fourth-quarter run with a deep 3 and walked back up the court holding out three fingers to the hometown crowd.  “Tough couple games this week for us, but we responded tonight,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “Total team effort; what I love about it is it was probably our best team effort of the season.”  TIP-INS  Heat: G Victor Oladipo missed his fourth straight game with right knee soreness. ... Butler, the former Timberwolves star who forced his way out with a trade, was booed loudly the first time he touched the ball by the limited fans in attendance. ... Butler recorded multiple steals for the ninth straight game, setting a franchise record and extending the longest streak of his career. Sherman Douglas had eight consecutive such games in 1990.  Timberwolves: G Jaylen Nowell missed the game with a right tibia contusion. ... Towns extended his streak of games with a 3 to 70 games, the longest stretch by a player in franchise history. ... Edwards had a steal for the 25th straight game, the longest active streak in the NBA, and longest by a rookie in team history. The NBA record for a rookie is 31 straight games by Chris Paul in 2005-06.  KEY STAT  Heat coach Erik Spoelstra highlighted an important factor in the win: second-chance points. Minnesota had 10 offensive rebounds leading to 23 second-chance points. Miami only had five second-chance points.  “That’s tough to overcome,” Spoelstra said. “That’s a problem right now, us being able to finish our defense. At least the last three games, that has not been good enough.”  JOINT FUNDRAISER  The Timberwolves and Heat agreed to auction their pregame “With Liberty and Justice FOR ALL” warmup shirts to raise money for The Daunte Wright Memorial Fund. Wright was the Black man fatally shot by a police officer on April 11 in a nearby suburb.  The Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks – the previous two teams to play in Minnesota – along with the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx joined the cause. Each shirt will be autographed by players. The auction ran concurrently on the Timberwolves’ website during Friday’s game.  UP NEXT  Heat: Host the Nets on Sunday.  Timberwolves: Travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Sunday.  ------"
Anthony Edwards was like 9 years old when A Rod had his last above average season. If he doesn’t watch E! or read People magazine i fail to see how its so inconceivable for a 19 year old not to have heard of Alex Rodriguez. The last years of his career weren’t that interesting.
"And at the end of the game, Watanabe showed what kind of player he really is when he took the turnover instead of passing it to Malachi to run the clock down. Man will do anything for the team, whether it’s getting rammed by Anthony Edwards or nailing buzzer beating 3s.   He just doesn’t care about anything else other than playing his role. Truly embodies the Raptors team culture."
proud to say anthony edwards doesn't give a fuck about his stats and heaves them every chance he gets
This team's best player is out and their 2nd best player (Dlo) is always being forced to play with a 2nd PG by their dumbass coach. Their third best player is Malik Beasley and they basically don't have a PF. Anthony Edwards is just a rookie so he still has a lot to learn. The rest of team wouldn't play any significant minutes on any other team.
"At this point I'm looking at the coach. We have a sub-decent team but I don't know why Anthony Edwards isn't getting minute. We're 3-10, might as well throw the kitchen sink."
"Sure, as a POC myself, I get where you're coming from, but I think you're trying to make that decision for everyone.  When I was reading the comment, all I saw was someone saying a rookie seems really mature for his age. You sound like you've never been around young people in forever.   Young people can say dumb things, e.g Anthony Edwards and Kyrie. Old people can say dumb things, there's plenty of examples on that one.   Forcing a race angle when none was implied is dumb."
He is not going to live up to that first overall pick. You can tell me it’s too early all you want but sometimes you can just tell right away a player is not it and Anthony Edwards definitely ain’t it
Anthony edwards and Juancho for KD and Harden   Who says no?
I think Anthony Edwards is going to be a beast eventually.
They took Anthony Edwards #1 and let Wiseman fall to the Warriors
Anthony Edwards looks bad
Anthony Edwards sent him to the ER
Can’t wait for the age new timberwolves saying I can’t believe we drafted Anthony Edwards over Wiseman.
I get why Anthony Edwards said he wanted to play football now
Above average in every category.   Reminds me of Anthony “A1 from day 1” Edwards.
"I liked that 3 teamer someone posted where the wizards get Anthony Edwards, Culver,  and some picks, the sixers get Beal, and the Wolves get Simmons."
"This is what I'd do:  **Minnesota Receive**: Ben Simmons  **76ers Receive**: Bradley Beal  **Wizards Receive**: Minnesota FRP (unprotected?) 2022/2024/2026 + pick swaps 2023/2025/2027, Anthony Edwards, Jarret Culver  Matisse Thybulle (PHI), Philly 2022 FRP (Top 15 protected, if not conveyed then 2 SRP)  Hawks FRP (Protected Top 20, 2022-2025, if not conveyed then SRP 2025/2026 conveyed), Tony Snell  **Hawks Receive**: Ricky Rubio  You could sub out the Hawks for a different team that you think could use Rubio more (maybe Blazers/Heat/Pacers/Bucks)."
"Lol, basketball isn't anime.  Taj gibson grunting at Anthony edwards won't make him become a respectable shooter.  It won't make D'Angelo Russell not the slowest guard in the league, it won't make Jarrett Culver show any sort of offensive skillset"
Anthony Edwards is Erin lol
"Wiseman sonning Anthony Edwards, the No1 Draft pick, would be a pretty nice narrative.  I want to see him poster Ant and I want to see Wiggins lock down DLo as a screw you to all the haters of that trade."
what is anthony edwards? cause he’s been worse than both
"&gt; WAS receives: Anthony Edwards, Jarrett Culver, Ricky Rubio, Mathisse Thybulle, ‘21 PHI 1st   Look at what Pelicans got for Jrue. Washington can get a similar package if they're patient enough"
Anthony edwards is terrible all year and then drops a random 45 point game in March
"Dude is trash, trade him to the Timberwolves for stars Anthony Edwards and Ricky Rubio and a cool 2028 first round pick. Got to get overpaid Booker on a shitty franchise like Minnesota to also free Anthony Edwards and Rubio"
Don't worry Anthony Edwards is the best scorer but sadly not efficient
Honestly I have no problem with Trae getting foul calls. I just wish the NBA was more consistent. I had to watch Anthony Edwards drive to the basket and get hammered 6 times with zero calls and then see Trae Young get fouled on pretty weak calls. I just want consistency.
Because Anthony Edwards was the #1 pick in case you didn’t know
"Anthony Edwards needs to start. The sooner he gets star calls on drives to the hoop the better. This team isnt winning anything, just go super small and live with the results"
"Watching the Wolves play, you got Russell, Jarrett Culver, Anthony Edwards, Malik Beasley, and then literally WHO? for the other guys. Because of COVID, they should have Chuck play ""Who He Play For"" every week, but they'll use 5 guys who started at least one game in the past week."
"I think you can get these young pieces and some picks from their teams for Simmons today  Fox, LaMelo, Wiseman, Anthony Edwards, JJJ (maybe), Ayton. I dont think any of their teams is giving them up for 2 years of James Harden"
"&gt;Last year his costar was Wiggins...  &gt;Again we got Beasley and D’lo this season alongside Anthony Edwards.   So you agree with what I originally said? He needs better talent for him to see team success. He’s like AD, he’s not one of these guys who can lead a team of average to below average players. He’s probably like AD where’s he’s not meant to be the best player on a team."
"&gt;What’d they do in 2019 after they traded Jimmy? Miss the playoffs  We were in the playoff hunt until RoCo and DRose got injured.  &gt;Last year even if KAT hadn’t missed a bunch of games, the Wolves still weren’t good enough to make the playoffs.  Last year his costar was Wiggins...  &gt;I watched some of their games last year, outside of KAT, they were fucking trash.  Again we got Beasley and D'lo this season alongside Anthony Edwards."
How do you guys feel about your new Star Anthony Edwards? He seems to have so much talent and potential you guys must be very happy to have drafted him
They already have their star in Anthony Edwards
"&gt;Wolves think D’angelo Russell is the greatest player of all time. That’s **literally** the reason  and no, anthony edwards was the \#1 pick for many draft boards, so I think you're full of shit"
"Anthony Edwards is not ready to contribute to winning basketball team, and Jarrett Culver just isn't that good to overcome his weaknesses. Kat got injured and COVID which gave DLo time to shine. Wolves fans finding out what DLo value is to the team."
Honestly Anthony Edwards seemed to be a great first overall
"Terrible, guy is trash. Dude needs to be traded to Minnesota for Rubio and Anthony Edwards who does cool dunks."
Can I interest you in an Anthony Edwards?
Anthony Edwards
I hope my takes that Anthony Edwards is the next Dion Waiters age very poorly in a similar manner.

"I mean if you get a top 2 pick this year, let's just say 1 again, then you're pairing DLO, Cade, Anthony Edwards, and KAT. That team has to at least compete for an 8th seed right?"
"Who He Play For? is just general ignorance of the league, not aimed at any particular race or ethnic group.   Also, the best way to keep track of player movement is to play fantasy. Even if a Garrett Temple isn't good enough to be directly relevant in fantasy, he's indirectly relevant by being just good enough to steal minutes from guys who are. Examples: Jarrett Culver taking minutes from Anthony Edwards, Troy Brown taking minutes from Deni."
"Anthony Edwards is raw, but the dude is a FREAK"
"I mean you could do this for every team right. Here I'll do it for the T-Wolves:  Malik Beasley has been good for them averaging over 20 points a game, Anthony Edwards looks like he's going to be a star, Ricky Rubio is good enough to contribute for a contender, and their own pick could fall top-3 this year and they could get Cade Cunningham. D'Angelo Russell has had a rough start but once he gets going he's gonna be scary. KAT's mom passed away through COVID and he's going through a lot rn as well, and he's missed a few games through a hand injury, but there's a great chance he could get to all-NBA level play soon enough and Wolves could go on a winning streak.  But nobody gives Wolves or any other team extra context for no reason. So I'm not sure why you feel Warriors need so much extra context."
Isn’t it Anthony Edwards? He’s the only football player in the NBA
Yeah but Anthony Edwards is avg 1.0 PPG over his last two on 1-14 shooting so...    Yeah...
"I know it's seen as a joke, but there really shouldn't be a draft. It's one of the most anti American functions of our society. The draft should be replaced by Rookie Free Agency. Teams should be allowed to offer rookie contacts that scale according to the record from the previous season.   For example, if Anthony Edwards decided to take a 1yr $5m deal with the Lakers as opposed to 4yr $40m with the TWolves he should have the right to choose that."
"Anthony Edwards is gonna be Andrew Wiggins 2.0 lmfao. He'll average 20 PPG for a couple of seasons and trick y'all into thinking he's a good scorer but the guy couldn't shoot for dick in college, can't shoot now, and probably won't be able to in the future."
It depends on the players. If I’m someone like Minnesota would I trade Anthony Edwards for Simmons? Absolutely. Would I trade Anthony edwards for the nets 24-27 picks? Absolutely not.
"No, but if I’m Anthony Edwards, I’m taking a hypothetical $17m over 2 to go with the Warriors rather than the wolves, because like you said, the rookie cap is based on the standings.  If I’m Zion, I’m gonna take a slightly lower NBA pay to join the Knicks because I could make it back in endorsements. Big market gets the best prospect and the pelicans can get the scraps.  2016, is Simmons going to the Sixers? Fuck no, it’s Laker town. They have the 2nd pick so for a couple mill less a year I get to live in LA, work with a historically great franchise and probably make back the money I lost in the draft with endorsements.  In almost every draft there’s one more desirable location, and over years this is gonna shift to big market teams.   I don’t think a rookie is gonna leave $30 mil on the table, but I sure as hell believe one would leave $2 mil to get to a bigger location."
"How so? Again, I'm saying rookie cap is based on standings. You don't think the fact that say the Timberwolves can offer their guy $20 million over 2 with the option to make it $44 million over 4 years might be enticing to someone over the 2 years, $4 million (with possibly being 4 years, $10 million) a team like the Lakers could offer? Especially when the qualifying offers would likewise have a huge disaparity. Anthony Edwards will make as much money in just his rookie year with the Wolves as he would across an entire 4 year contract with a team that would be the equivalent of picking late in the first? You think an 18 or 19 year old kid that's never really had money is leaving $30 million on the table? Because I sure as hell don't"
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
"Ben Simmons with less picks would have been a great package, he’s a proven star and #1 pick  A trade for CJ, who Imo is better than oladipo to pair James Harden with Lillard  A trade for Anthony Edwards, to team James Harden with KAT and DLO. Minnesota is desperate to win something, and there’s no guarantee any of those draft picks are a #1 pick and Anthony Edwards has looked good  James Wiseman maybe, with Wiggins or Oubre or Draymond. Gives Curry help and Harden might fit well in the Warriors offense  Clippers for Paul George  Nuggets maybe for Harris, Michael Porter JR, some other players  Bucks for Middleton and some picks  They’re other trades they could have pursued Celtics Jaylen Brown, Raptors Siakam,   It’s not 2K and I’m not a GM and I don’t know of any of these salaries match but they’re ideas. Oladipo is a great player but I think the players I listed above are better and Oladipo has been dealing with a lot of injury issues the past few seasons"
I'd agree with that. Only reason I watch them is to see Anthony Edwards
holy shit i’d love to get anthony edwards i love that kid
Just Anthony Edwards
"Anthony Edwards, Kyrie, Caruso, Kawhi.  If there is a bench unit, Harden and Josh Hart have good onscreen chemistry."
Anthony Edwards
"For an actual game that can run well: Tim Duncan, Channing Frye, Richard Jefferson, Andrei Kirilenko (as they all played WoW together)  Otherwise: CP3 (he would get into it), Steven Adams, Anthony Edwards, and Joel Embiid"
Anthony edwards as of today
"Cade Cunningham isn't even a guaranteed #1 tbh. There are some guys who might push him. Thing is those few guys are still considered better options than, say, Anthony Edwards."
he's legit.  If Anthony Edwards put up this state line people would go nuts.
"I don't even know why I checked, but this comment at the end of the Wolves recap is stupid and I am tired of seeing it.  &gt;with that in mind, a timeout was probably in order before Anthony Edwards threw the ball away on the final possession of OT.  People are only saying it because of the outcome. No one calls that time out in the flow of the game there. It is dumb to point to this as a shortcoming from Saunders, he has enough actual problems he needs to address.  It was a rookie mistake by the player and I am willing to bet Edwards doesn't make that mistake again."
Anthony Edwards was nowhere near as hyped as Wiggins. It just feels that way because of how long the process was this year.
"Looking at you, Anthony Edwards."
"Not to mention that the DLo trade forced you guys to pick Anthony Edwards over LaMelo. Give me Wiggins, LaMelo and a likely top 8 pick over DLo and Edwards any day, no offense to Edwards who seems solid."
"True, but part-time actress Anthony ""Where's the camera?"" Edwards missed 8 consecutive shots to score 0 points."
Anthony Edwards
"Yeah congrats to Lonzo on barely avoiding the triple single and setting that record on dogshit efficiency that was broken literally 4 months later.   Totally the same type of triple double. 9/10 shooting for Melo and 12 rebounds with 11 assists? Garbage.   Can we trade for that beautiful stroke Anthony Edwards has? I'd love to see some ill-advised 30+ footers with 17 seconds left in the clock to end 2-9 from three. Totally doesn't scream ""AAU baby bust"" because he doesn't actually know how to play basketball, just shoot threes and dunk.   Have fun being miserable when Melo is an AS in 3 years and we're picking up his options and as a fanbase you're debating if Edwards is worth it anymore."
"they could be fun. KAT is a star, just watch him develop and know that if the team can build around him they will eventually be successful. anthony edwards has stupid potential and it will be fun to see how he puts things together. basically where the suns were at two years ago, just have to hope the front office makes smart decisions to take advantage of that."
I’d pick the twolves then cause KAT is amazing and I think Anthony edwards will be a star in future simply cause he’s hilarious
I’m still not sold on Anthony edwards
"How about if you ask KAT, a young, healthy, athletic basketball, who makes even more than Anthony Edwards, what would he say? Would he say yes, despite all of the loss and suffering he has faced? What about Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, who has a newborn son. Oh wait the both of them sat. Postponing the game still gets the NBA players their game checks. Just at a later date. Which is fine, they are making plenty to hold themselves over. You’re being ridiculous, frankly. And your perception of money is clearly different than mine."
"I still beleive that anthony edwards is the best prospect, the guy is built like a tank."
"Anthony Edwards has, in fact, NOT been playing *professional* basketball for years."
"Because Anthony Edwards is good too, I'm confused as to how that blows your mind. We're 10 games into their careers and their numbers aren't even significantly different coming into tonight."
Anthony Edwards isn't looking too shabby. Too early to tell
Anthony edwards went first not wiseman
Wiseman is still developing and looks decent. He's got a good shooting base. Needs more nba experience for defense. Does Anthony Edwards look that bad?
"Anthony Edwards (born August 2001) is a Minnesota Forest Wolf National Basketball Association (NBA) and American Basketball Player. He plays basketball with the Georgian Buludo team. Six feet (1.96 meters) and 102 kilograms safe.    In preparation for the Holy Spirit, Edwards graduated from his home school in Atlanta and received a five-star accent to beat one of the 2019 celebrities who led the camp. As an adult, McDonald's won an All-American first team title in the United States All-America Today. He volunteered to play basketball in Georgia, was known for his work, and was named SEC freshman of the year after his first stint at the club. He was selected to the Minnesota Forest Wolves in the first round of the 2020 NBA Draft."
Rookie mistake there at the end by Anthony Edwards
How about Anthony Edwards? I think he's made an impact as well.
No doubt but compared to other rookies like Patrick Williams or Anthony Edwards it's unlikely he'll have the stats
Anthony Edwards who?
"I honestly can’t believe how Minnesota can look at Melo and Anthony Edwards and conclude that Edwards was the better pick at 1. Someone needs to explain that to me because my mind is blown.  GSW passing on Melo and taking Wiseman at 2 I get, but Minnesota baffles me"
Anthony Edwards &gt; Dame  Not even joking Dame is trash imo
I hope so but Anthony Edwards and Wiseman will make it a good competition.
"You can also tell that the best rookies every year are those with supreme confidence in themselves. Anthony Edwards may not be the most talented prospect, but he sure is the most confident out of that draft class."
Bradley Beals look makes me think of Bball Jack Sparrow  Anthony Edwards hair looks very comfortable  Sabonis reminds me of Francis from Malcolm in the Middle  Kawaiis is always perfect
"Does this go for every rookie including anthony edwards, haliburton, wiseman. or does this only go for Lamelo?"
"ridiculous no one said Anthony Edwards! The #1 pick, who puts on a scoring clinic every night. Granted some nights are more inefficient than others, he looks like a star in the making"
"Deni has exceeded my expectations and Pritchard looks just like he did at Oregon. Maxey could be really good in a few years and Patrick Williams doesn't look as ""bust-y"" as he was touted to be. Wiseman and Anthony look completely NBA-ready as well. Edwards seems to be a better shooter than was thought. Quickley and Precious are contributing. Excited to see more of Nnaji, Bey, Terry, Elijah Huhes, and Tre Jones."
"Anthony edwards will average the most points , so him.  ROY is not about the best player"
"Lonzo has more followers on IG than KAT + dlo + edwards + rubio + beasley + 1,000,000   Lamelo has 15x anthony edwards' followers on IG.  Not to mention Zion, either"
Probably hyping up d lo and Anthony edwards as we speak.  A true Minnesota homer never throws in the towel
"Great dunk by aspiring rapper, Anthony Edwards."
"100%. If you love what you do, you’re passionate and want to get better at it. If you view it as your “job” then you’re going to go through the motions every single day. I’m Bulls fan and I think that’s why PWill flew up draft boards. He loves basketball and will grind to get better. I also think it’s why Anthony Edwards was not the consensus #1 when he’s clearly the most talented."
So weird not seeing Anthony Edwards in this list
"Anthony Edwards, obviously"
"James Wiseman has freakish athleticism, length, and Size.  Anthony Edwards has size and explode with great athleticism to get buckets  Lamelo Ball has the height with good lead ball handling, and his passing is elite level  Tyrese Haliburton is just good at everything, and she showed drastic improvement from freshman to sophomore year. He is older than James Wiseman, Anthony Edwards, and Lamelo Ball with extra time to improve his skills against good competition.  Tyrese Haliburton talented but those 3 have potential to be top 10 player in the league be the main guy on the team, but they have a lot of work to do to get there. I am not sure if they are going to reach that level. Whatever happen from his freshman to sophomore year Tyrese Haliburton gets it, and know what to do on the court with his abilities with almost any situation. To me his potential is Malcolm Brogden."
I think this team is a good deal worse than the Jimmy Butler-Tom Thibodeau one.   I think you have to buy into a pretty extremely optimistic career projection for Anthony Edwards to buy into this team doing anything other than being an 8 seed 1st round exit.
"I think he was not being properly utilized (especially by Saunders) on top of being the primary vet on the youngest (2nd youngest?) team in the league. Dude was clearly being stretched thin and was trying to teach half the starters defense in-game. To really sum it up I think he was being asked to do way more than he ever should have been instead of just being told to just play his game. Not to mention the DLo/Rubio rotations were just never quite figured out (again, especially under saunders. We’ll see more of Finch’s vision after the offseason). As far as I understand it Rosas brought Rubio back to provide Anthony Edwards with the mentoring that Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker benefitted from. It totally worked too as the Ant/Rubio bromance is very real. Rubio got a ton of slander from other Timberwolves fans but I feel like it was pretty obvious he was being asked to do way too much (you would literally see him basically coaching players in between plays). If our coaches just asked him to play his game I think he’s the same player he always was, but they didn’t, so he wasn’t.  Edit: to be clear these are all just my takes on the situation and to answer your last question: I don’t think they trade him unless they get a solid offer. Definitely not looking to unload him. His relationship with Ant and the fact that Ant has a crazy amount of potential means they’re kind of a package deal in my eyes. Plus I would personally love to see Rubio retire in a Wolves jersey."
Anthony Edwards just wants to rap and play football.
Anthony Edwards and Darius garland would be a sweet back court
That belongs to Anthony edwards
"Jokic’s existence is basically a meme and people love that. From watching Pokémon to chilling in a horse wagon to working out to Serbian polka music. People also love making jokes about his weight whether he’s bigger or slimmer.  Anthony Edwards is beloved. Dame is beloved. Zion, DRose, Jimmy Buckets (maybe not after that series lol), etc. all get love"
Anthony Edwards by a decent margin imo
No Anthony Edwards?
"Either this is Nate Duncan's account, or some superfan. Weird.  Regardless: I can assure you almost no one knows or gives a shit about Nate Duncan's opinion on Anthony Edwards"
"Nate Duncan HATES Anthony Edwards  ... or so the internet wants you to believe. The guy made one innocuous tweet about the guy, and it blew up into this huge storm of everyone trying to dunk on how ""unfun"" Nate is.  I enjoy Nate, and if his stuff isn't up your alley, just stay away from it. Everyone going out of their way to shit on him actually just increased Nate's platform/visibility, so who's winning there? But the funny thing is Nate doesn't intentionally throw out bad takes to go viral, it just happened by accident."
You'd 100% trade Anthony Edwards for #3 and #6? OR is KAT viewed as the 2nd best?
Anthony Edwards
Remember when Anthony Edwards was more into rapping than basketball?
"Maybe, but I wouldn't count on it. The NBA is a little weird with draft picks and unless you get a top pick in a good draft class, their value is very small. Compare that to the NFL, who value top 15 picks like gold and you can many times find a franchise changing player. The NBA is just strange that way, and many times, you need 2-3 firsts as well as a decent player or two to trade for a all star.   Look at the Harden trade, for example. The Nets gave up Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Taurean Prince, Rodions Kurucs as well as three unprotected 1st rounders (2022,  2024, 2026) and four first-round pick swaps (2021, 2023, 2025, 2027). With two young promising players they still had to just throw in 4 firsts and 4 swaps to get Harden. If the Nets team goes bust any time soon (which, can happen with Kyrie.. just sayin), they are fucked. Even if they tank down to the bottom of the league, they either gave their pick away, or another team will swap their pick away.  I'd imagine the same kind of firepower in a trade for Dame will be needed, likely with a 4 team trade as well, so even with a young a promising Anthony Edwards, I would expect a TON of picks to be going Portland's way as well as at least another decent starter."
"I guess yes technically. But the only way is if were saying his ceiling is Kobe/MJ. Realistically, he’s gonna be more of a Zach Lavine, Anthony Edwards type player if he pans out, which I think he will. I think Cade’s realistic ceiling is higher than those guys just cuz he’s of the 6’8 playmaker/scorer type. So yes technically, no realistically, imo"
"I don’t think there’s any scenario in which Anthony Edwards is traded. And I feel as though the gap in value between Simmons and Dame is probably 3 first rounders, so maybe you’re right that this package is slightly too much for Portland and 76ers maybe keep Thybulle"
I’ll take one Anthony Edwards please.
Maybe Portland would be ok with some lower value picks if they got Anthony Edwards?
"I think the implosion was in large part situational, as in I think both pressure on Ben Simmons from the Philly side and the Hawks being an unusually bad match-up for Simmons made him look worse than he is. The Sixers were a shot away from winning game 1, an injury (albeit to Embiid) away from winning game 5, and a few free throws away (albeit from Ben Simmons) from winning game 3 (I think I got the number right), and if we imagine them coming up against the Bucks, but particularly the Nets, who despite injuries to Kyrie Irving and James Harden were an inch of KD's toes away from winning game 7, Simmons would have been absolutely indispensable to the Sixers' chances in the Conference Finals. His value would be very clear in a series against either KD or Giannis.  Also, in Philly, he was often the second scoring option, basically unless Seth Curry was hot. Minnesota has what he lacks (KAT for shooting from a big, DLo for a playmaker who has the threat of just pulling up) and he has what Minnesota lacks, a good secondary ball-handler, good defense to cover for KAT or DLo depending on opposition, and good passing out of the interior. If you could get him for Ricky Rubio and some young guards/wings that already sit behind Anthony Edwards and Dlo and would sit behind Simmons too if they stayed, doesn't seem like the worst thing in the world.  But I'm a Knicks fan. I'm the kind of person who thought it was realistic that KD, Kawhi, and Demarcus Cousins were coming in 2019. So what do I know lol."
"I don't think that Portland has any leverage to get Maxey *and* Thybulle out of the Sixers when they're also losing Simmons. Maybe Philly sends both teams some picks, enough for Portland and Minnesota to be ok with Anthony Edwards to Portland?"
"In a trade scenario, I had the T'Wolves giving up Anthony Edwards to Portland in a 3-team trade (Lillard to replace Simmons in Philly). The salary can be made up with some of the young wings crowding the bench like Okogie and Culver instead, but I thought Portland would want someone exciting back to replace Lillard. If it also means losing Rubio's contract in addition to getting Simmons which it seems we agree is a great fit for Minnesota's stars, would you still want Anthony Edwards to be untouchable?"
"&gt; with a lottery talent  Good rookies are rare. Trae Young and Anthony Edwards both developed way faster than anyone thought they would and were not exactly setting the world on fire in their rookie years. Lottery talent might make the raps a beast 4-5 years from now, but I wouldn't count on it happening overnight.   Also with the nets still being the nets next year this might be the right time for a quick retooling."
"He’s allegedly lost 30 pounds and it shows. He might have had the most dunks of anyone on the team after the all-star break, and this is on a team with Anthony Edwards."
The timberwolves would be dumb enough to go trade Anthony edwards for Ben Simmons too lmao
"You can't believe this wholeheartedly. No disrespect to Anthony Edwards who looks to be something in the future, Simmons is still REALLY good. His talents are just the wrong ones for this Philly team. An elite wing defender and good distributor is great next to KAT and Dlo who are both heavily offensive leaning guys. I think he would fit in Denver too just because of all the shooting that team has and lack of size at the guard spot."
Anthony Edwards and DLo exist
Wolves get Ben Simmons  Knicks get Anthony Edwards.. Malik Beasley.. picks  Sixers get Julius Randle  Who says no?
You can take Anthony edwards from my cold dead hands
Playing 4 on 5 on offense doesn’t work in the playoffs. Also stop acting like KAT and Anthony edwards would be this incredibly overwhelming offensive force if they even were good enough to be in the playoff mix (doubtful)
Beasley is earning around 15m annually and the 4th year is a team option.  &gt;He is also arguably the worst defender in the NBA by every single metric.  That was probably Anthony Edwards but feel free to link me the metrics for Beasley.
"Wolves Receive: Ben Simmons, Philadelphia FRP  Trailblazers Receive: Anthony Edwards Tyrese Maxsey, Philadelphia FRP, Philadephia FRP  76ers Receive: Damien Lillard  Just spit balling here"
"Yeah I mean to a certain point, defensive stats are noisy especially with such a small sample size. Lou’s numbers are pretty clear outliers based on his career and, as you said, don’t match the eye test. So it’s one of the times where you can reasonably say, there’s context we’re missing because this guy is almost certainly a negative.   But Trae’s regular season numbers make it way harder to argue the postseason ones are mistaken. He’s tied with Bryn Forbes for 2nd to last in d-raptor of 395 who played at least 350 minutes (R.J. Hampton is 395th). He’s tied with Beal, Anthony Edwards, and Lonnie Walker for 165th out of 179 qualifying guys in dbpm. And he’s 4th worst in the league in Bball index’s d-Lebron behind  D’Angelo Russell, Anfernee Simons, and Lonnie.  And listen Trae’s so fucking talented anyway that being a negative defensively doesn’t mean he isn’t still a clear net positive overall. You can see that in the advanced stats with offensive and defensive parts because the combination of them is a net positive due to just how high Trae’s numbers are on offense."
Anthony edwards was at the hawks sixers game when embiid and JC got into it
Anthony Edwards and Dwight have been to hawks playoff games this year.  Anthony was sitting close when the Joel and John scuffle happened.  Dwight was there tonight.
Some stupid reactionary wolves fans were really comparing Anthony Edwards to this dude when he struggled to start the season. I wonder what it’s like to be that much of a fucking idiot 🧐
"I mean yeah fans are mostly pieces of shit, me included. I was calling Anthony Edwards Wiggins 2.0 and hoped we took Lamelo instead"
"We have the same problem with Anthony Edwards here in Minnesota. Dude went from High School to a Covid shortened college season, in which he was there a year early.  Right in to an NBA regular season.  People were trashing him in the first half of the season. NBA fans and the media are way to quick to judge players."
"Idk how people can see quotes like this and still think it's crazy that the Suns (or some other team) will pay Chris Paul a lot of money in the offseason. Part of that contract is for his play and part of it is to make sure you get the most out of your young players. I have a feeling CP3 makes it much more likely that Ayton lives up to/outplays his own contract.          Also between this quote and Anthony Edwards saying the other day that Rubio was the most important person for his success this past season, it should be clear to every rebuilding GM that the *very first* move they make should be to bring in a veteran PG and floor general. We've seen over and over again that they have a disproportionate impact on the rest of the team and it's the best way to make sure the young players you spend high draft picks and max extensions on reach their full potential. Just in the last two years we've seen CP3 help OKC, Rubio help Phoenix last year, CP3 with Phoenix this year, Rubio helping Anthony Edwards, Rose turning around Barrett and the Knicks (and maybe others I'm forgetting). Idk how many times teams will keep bringing in MCW, Elfrid Payton, whoever the Bulls have had recently, etc before they realize that it sets back a whole rebuild and limits the potential of young players (who are the ones who you really need to get back to playoff/championship contention)."
he still put up his numbers... they may have dipped slightly but that has probably more too do with the emergence of Anthony Edwards towards the 2nd half of the season
Yuta Watanabe on Anthony Edwards.  Blame the pandemic all you want but really that's what ended our season.
Anthony Edwards
Those two guys and Anthony Edwards are going to become the brand new Migos
*Anthony Edwards has entered the chat*
With John Collins in the playoffs still you taking him over Zion? Taking Cam Reddish over Anthony Edwards?
Anthony Edwards FMVP at 20 years old
"I don't think so, Simmons fills in for KAT's weaknesses much better, is a more natural passer. Anthony Edwards becoming a star would allow you to compete but that's not happening when the two other best players can't play defense."
KD Kawhi and Anthony Edwards the funniest players in the league
"r/nba by far, you should’ve seen the pre nba Lamelo takes you would’ve thought he was a war criminal, same with Anthony Edwards. Everyone was calling him “nFL rAppER”"
"Jordan Clarkson won 6MOY, Miles Bridges had a breakout year, Lonzo had a career year, Anthony Edwards proved to be pretty good, THT is likely to get paid by somebody, Garland had an impressive second year, Draymond at least had a bounce back year.  And don't forget about MAXEY!"
"But for real, though.  Has there been a more landmark season in league history?  First Anthony Edwards becomes the first player of color selected number one, and now this."
Anthony Edwards had negative advanced stats as a rookie too. is he trash?
They would have never sucked on the tit that is playoff basketball and would have missed out on Anthony Edwards too.
Cade is more of a all around player than a pure scorer. Not to say he wont be a good scorer.   Jalen Green is similar to a Anthony Edwards or Zach Lavine. He will be an elite scorer.
I dont think there's any FO in the NBA outside of the one in Minnesota who would take Anthony Edwards over Cade Cunningham. But yes generally agree with your premise.
I need Anthony Edwards on there as well
Him and Anthony edwards are so fucking loveable
"Last few drafts, best player...  2020: Edwards(#1) or Ball (#3)  2019: Zion(#1) or Morant (#2)  2018: Luka (#3) or Young (#5). Ayton was #1  2017: Tatum (#3). Fulz at #1 was a bust  2016: Simmons at #1 is probably the best.   2015: KAT at #1 is probably best  2014: Jokic at #41 or Embiid at #3. Wiggins was #1  2013: Giannis at #15. Anthony Bennett’s was #1 BUST.  2012: Anthony Davis #1  2011: Kawhi #15. Kylie was #1.   Out of 10 drafts, the #1 pick was the best player definitely three times. Maybe two more times. Twice they were a major bust."
"I’m honestly not sure about that, Anthony Edwards is a great athlete with size. Cade definitely goes first, though."
What an incredible dunk… but Anthony Edwards definitely had the dunk of the year.

"Jalen green seems like a more hype, less chill Anthony Edwards"
the Anthony Edwards and Ricky Rubio relationship is something I greatly enjoy
Is Anthony Edwards the only guy in that entire arena   It looks lonely.
Anthony Edwards needs a podcast
How do they show Anthony edwards over Ben wallace
Scoring 20+ isn't nearly as common in college as it is in the NBA. Here are some recent Freshmen #1 picks and the number of times they scored 20+  Greg Oden: 5  Derrick Rose: 9  John Wall: 8  Kyrie Irving: 3 (only played 11 games)  Anthony Davis: 6  Anthony Bennett: 13  Andrew Wiggins: 11  KAT: 2  Ben Simmons: 18  Markelle Fultz: 18  Deandre Ayton: 17  Zion Williamson: 23  Anthony Edwards: 13
Anthony Edwards last game with UGA was the 1st round of the SEC tournament
"Has to be the Timberwolves, they’ve had at least 5 different number 1 picks on their roster the last 5 years and have consistently stayed at the bottom of their conference.   Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, KAT, DRose, Anthony Edwards… and that’s not including their other top picks that have resulted in nothing. They definitely do not deserve Cade Cunningham."
Imagine if it’s Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards
Maybe they shouldn’t have waited half a decade to get KAT some help. Had your chance. Fucked up. You even got Anthony Edwards last year. Franchises like that always do less with more.
Anthony Edwards please idk how but get him in there
"You have to be careful with this though- I remember thinking the same thing about Lonzo, and he's made significant improvements since coming to the NBA. Anthony Edwards faced similar criticisms last year, and that seems to have been overblown as well."
You don’t know your stuff. There isn’t a team in the league who would trade Anthony Edwards for Ben Simmons even if the SIXERS were sending back picks.
Anything to get Anthony edwards to the playoffs is fine by me
"I'm always skeptical of top picks who couldn't win in college or were mediocre but had ""potential"". Wiggins won at KU, but that was largely due to Embiid. Fultz played for a trash U Dub team. Bennett was mediocre at UNLV. Time will tell on Anthony Edwards at UGA. Simmons played well on a mediocre LSU team that declined an NIT invite after missing the tournament.   Rose? Carried Memphis to title game. Davis? Won title at UK. Wall? Went to Elite 8 and won 30 games as best player. Irving? Went to Sweet 16 and won 30 games as best player at Duke. Griffin? Went to Elite 8 and won 30 games at OU. KAT? Won 38 games and made the Final Four at UK. Zion? Ayton? Won PAC conf and tourney title at Zona only to get upset in first round. Cultural revolution at Duke, easily dominant every minute on the floor.   Worth noting that Zion shot .680 from the floor compared to .560 from Simmons. When you are bigger and stronger than everyone else, you should be shooting better than 56% in college."
Kat has like a 70+ percent ts in the clutch and dlo (sometimes ) and anthony edwards. Lol
I’d love to see Jalen Suggs go to Minnesota and team up with Anthony Edwards! Potentially the most athletic backcourt in the league
&gt;neither was Anthony Edwards  Over the  course of the season yes due to his terrible start but since ASB he has been.
&gt; wasn't statistically a positive on offence  neither was Anthony Edwards
Same issue he had with Minnesota and look how well they're doing without him too. At least for Wolves they got Anthony Edwards now. 76ers definitely need a change.
"Jaylen brown, taTum, Middleton, lavine, butler, hayward,klay, demar, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal murray, cj mcollum Are all better than him easily. Powell, Anthony Edwards, hield, mikal bridges, etc are arguably better."
"Oh yes there are many teams that want him. Ben just doesn't fit with Imbeed, both players clog the lanes and can only excel in the post  Ben for Anthony Edwards. He can run a two man PNR with KAT the spacing would be deadly"
"&gt;Minnesota needs defense and playmaking. Either they can structure a deal around D'lo or make it more roleplayer centric with Rubio/Beasley   Huh? We currently have D'lo,KAT and Rubio as good playmakers and Anthony Edwards who is an okay one. The only reason we'd be trading for Ben is for his defence lol and D'lo ain't getting traded 1000%"
"wut 76ers were never in a position to draft Luka, Zion, or Anthony Edwards"
Ben Simmons for Anthony Edwards
How is Lamelo on this list?     Also where tf is Anthony Edwards
*Anthony Edwards laughing in the corner*
I think anthony edwards will win a scoring title in his career. I will make that conservative estimate.
"I’m just saying I think any perimeter lockdown defender is far more important in the playoffs.   Switchable wings are far far far more valuable than interior guys in today’s game. They’re too easy to scheme around in the playoffs when the best threats aren’t Ricky Rubio and Anthony Edwards (sorry Twolves bros).   His defensive capabilities are able to be schemed around unlike Kawhi, Giannis, Draymond, and other wings."
Anthony Edwards maybe he likes to have fun
Anthony Edwards revenge season coming
"As Anthony Edwards just sits there in his chair, right in the middle of it all. Lol (White shirt and Mask)"
[Anthony Edwards?](https://youtu.be/SyNodFiofS8)
"I’d rather have Anthony Edwards, Zion, Derrick Jones, Gordon. Because you know Lavines not going back, he’s too set on winning a 3 point contest he doesn’t stand a chance in"
Anthony Edwards has something to say about that
Mitchell for the Jazz hands down… and I’m tempted to say Anthony Edwards for Minnesota
The fact the TWolves were in the running for the #1 pick this year is a joke. How? You guys have KAT Anthony Edwards and D-Lo  Blows my mind that they were still this horrible
Anthony Edwards /thread
"Wiggins jumps really high but he can't effectively build mass and muscle.  Anthony Edwards has the ideal guard body imo. If you have time watch him play in the post against other guards in the NBA, he straight up just moves them."
Current #1 pick Anthony Edwards was two years old when LeBron was drafted.
"I don't know what 4 out of 5 of these are, but wouldn't Anthony Edwards WS be affected by the Timbs being terrible?"
Literally should’ve just used the Anthony Edwards clip and called it a day
"People are hard sleeping on Anthony Edwards.  Since the All-Star break (29 games, a decent sample size) this 19 year old kid has been averaging 23/5/3 on much better efficiency than earlier in the season, and playing better defense overall which is a big reason why we've been winning games as of late."
depending on what team he goes to Cade might get to chuck 8 a game as a rookie. hell anthony edwards who isn't even a good three point shooter gets 7 a game
He’s shooting 44.3% from 3 on 6 attempts/game already which is insane bc he has basically the same amount of post high school experience as Anthony Edwards lol

Zion has 7 turnovers in this game and you get mad at Bledsoe just cause one of his two turnovers looked more embarrassing. And what do you want him do to at the other end? No nba player in a regular season game is going to get in front of 225 lb Anthony Edwards when he’s dunking on a fast break.   This Bledsoe hate is so personal lol. How would you know what he thinks about the team? Everyone in the locker room has only good things to say about him. Who else do you want playing right now either? You can’t honestly argue that Kira is better than Bledsoe at either end. The Pelicans are trying to win games at this point in the season.
Yo this guy and Anthony Edwards are great
Anthony edwards is unbelievablely good
"Don't forget [the part](https://youtu.be/gY1Ru72l3wg) with him thanking Denver for the trade that shook up the team.  This guy is a riot.  I want to see a buddy comedy with Cole, Anthony Edwards, and Ja Morant."
"Am I crazy or did Anthony Edwards just do a similar drive, get similar contact and just get called for a travel here?  Odd."
Anthony Edwards shoots 8/22 every other game and is the worst defender in the NBA and you're ignoring it but somebody else is delusional.
"For me personally.  Anthony Edwards - Fun to watch and great in interviews   Paul George - One of the smoothest looking games   Embiid - The way he dominates is just so funny, he gets calls at will and it just pisses off his opponents. I love it."
"I admittedly don't watch a lot of Grizzlies games other than highlights so I can't really weigh in on that example.  I think your enjoyment of him ultimately comes down to how much stock you put into advanced stats. But again, those stats are typically accurate indicators if a young player will impact the league long term more often than not.  I think a lot of people are down on him because he wasn't as high on Anthony Edwards early on, even though the criticisms being made were spot on imho. At the start of the season, Edwards was incredibly inefficient and not a winning player, even though he's looked far better under a competent coach.   r/nba (and all of reddit tbf) loves a good circejerk and calling him an idiot and comparing him to blowhards like Skip just sounded ridiculous to me. But, to each their own. I'm happy to agree to disagree 🤷‍♀️"
"I said nothing bad about lamelo, while on the other hand you were talking alot of trash about ant. How are anthony edwards pre all star games the deciding factor but you dont seem to care about lamelo missing games. No point in responding to you cuz your just delusional"
"Anthony edwards has the 7th worst TS% in the nba this year. Horribly inefficient. All impact stats have him way below Lamelo and even below hali. He is showing some great flashes, but right now he is a losing player."
43% fg and 33% from 3. Still horribly inefficient. He’s one of the most inefficient rookies in the past few years. That’s not to say he will be bad because I think he will be a perineal allstar. Lamelo ball was shooting 45% fg and 38% from 3. Anthony edwards is supposed to be the shooter too. Lamelo is supposed to be the magic/chris Paul type guy but he is shooting way better than edwards.
"I mean it is a nice finish, but poster lol.  It is a one hand dunk where a guy jumped to contest.     On a poster scale if anthony edwards dunk on the raptors guy is a 10 this is about a 1.5."
"Anyone that doubts Booker's next deal being a Mega contract....needs to get their head checked! I'm not even a Suns fan, but a Soccer fan that enjoys basketball.  Add to the list:  Anthony Edwards  Ja Morant  Trey"

I remember him clowning Anthony Edwards after that awesome dunk.
Seems like the Timberwolves have always shown late season flashes over the past few years that gets everyone excited for the following year and it ends up the same. I hope they're good next year because KAT is a boss and I love Anthony Edwards.
Anthony Edwards
"If you don't like Anthony Edwards, don't ever go to Atlanta. Dude has the most ATL personality in the league lmao I love it."
"If that picks stays with the Wolves and they get someone productive year one they get into play-in tournament next season. Even if it doesn't I just feel like they're going to be good, Anthony Edwards is a baller."
I want to hang out with Anthony Edwards every day
"The odds of the Wolves keeping their pick:  Finish with worst record: 40.1%  2nd-worst record: 40.1%   3rd-worst record: 40.1%   4th-worst record: 36.6%   5th-worst record: 31.6%   6th-worst record: 27.6%  So the difference between finishing with the worst record in the league and 6th worst only drops the wolves odds at keeping their pick from 40% to 27.6%. From the Wolves perspective, is it really worth tanking to increase your odds at keeping your pick 12.4%? Is it worth teaching Anthony Edwards that it's okay to lose? Is it worth letting KAT go into another offseason in a bad mood with a team that's showing no hope or signs of improvement? What happens to morale if you tank and lose the pick anyway?   Everyone is generally pretty happy that they've decided to just go for it. It's a nice change as a Wolves fan. Enjoy the pick!"
Has there ever been a player as universally liked just by virtue of their personality as Anthony Edwards? Particularly after everyone figured he must be a jerk with the football comment.
This is easily my favorite (non-basketball) clip of Anthony Edwards *ever*
"&gt;  But I don't think this award is based on a particular playstyle.   I don't really think we can just chalk it up to a play-style or ""taking bad shots"". The team leaned on him to take these kinds of shots because they could not create his shots for him. Unlike players like Haliburton, who could rely on getting a clean look from 3, Edwards was considered one of the best players on the court for the Wolves, and defenses treated him that way. The team gave him those opportunities because they didn't have other good ways to score. Spacing was a huge issue for the Wolves, especially under Saunders, and Ant just didn't have the room to operate like a player like Haliburton. Saunders also valued pace over everything, so he encouraged Edwards's worst skill (pull-up jumper). I can't emphasize how much damage Saunders was doing to Edwards early on.   &gt; It's just that Anthony Edwards was legitimately bad results wise at doing the things he is being praised for now at the beginning of the season.   Ant has changed his play significantly from the first half because he is being coached better, and because he has players like Towns and DLo alongside him. Under Saunders, Ant took a lot of pull-up jumpers. He looked great driving the ball, but his pull-up game was pretty rough, and he relied way too much on it. Under Finch, he is driving a lot more to the hoop, drawing more fouls, and not relying on his pull-up jumper. He has improved significantly because he's changed his approach. I don't think its fair to say that he's just being praised now for doing the exact same thing.   &gt; Beasley? He was excellent up to his first injury.  Beasley and Ant didn't actually play together much early on; Ant usually came on for Beasely. And Ant is more of a dominant ball-handler than Beasley; Beasley was the team's only reliable spot-up shooter and was used that way."
Anthony Edwards is one of the funniest guys in the NBA
We're rooting for you! You got this!  Also Anthony Edwards is hilarious and I love his interviews.
"The question is, is D-Lo your second best player? or Anthony Edwards?  I think there's an argument to be made that Edwards is already better."
Words cannot express how much I love Anthony Edwards
"If you don't like Anthony Edwards at this point, I don't understand you and I don't like you"
"I just read Anthony Edwards (44) passed, and thought he dieded"
"Nah man, don’t give her the satisfaction. what would Anthony Edwards do?"
"Anthony Edwards (44) passed Landry Shamet (43 in March, 2019) for most 3s made in a month by a rookie."
I splurged on a box of cards to get over a girl and pulled an Anthony Edwards auto. I guess I should thank her lol
WARRIORS NEED OUR PICK MORE THAN WE DO  ANTHONY EDWARDS IS ROTY  WOLVES ARE 10-6 WHEN KAT AND DLO PLAY  CHRIS FINCH COTY
"My understanding/memory of it, and something like this: the  player with the most hype going for the high school class  was  supposed to be James wiseman who didn’t play a lot with the ncaa.   Lamelo wasn’t taken seriously pre-growth spurt, and we still didn’t know how much of a serious prospect he was, especially considering the possible supposed  media circus.  Haliburton was kinda an advanced stats/coach’s favorite player  type, but he was also polarizing.   Anthony edwards was basically the safest dice roll at the end of the day.  I was a huge fan of Vassell personally."
"You are really ignoring how much more pressure it is to win now.  Yes he took 3 less shots a game, but he had to completely change his shot profile and play style to accommodate for another player. While on top of that also make sure that they won games instead of focusing on progressing/getting used to the league.  Think of how much pressure is on Anthony Edwards right now compared to a guy like Jrue Holiday."
"MPJ has the same amount of post high school experience as Anthony Edwards, he’s gonna be fine. Ingram on the other hand can’t even make the play in as the 2nd best player on a team with a superstar lol, he’s not a winning player"
"2016-17: Lavine, Wiggins, and Towns are all 21 with a 26 year old Rubio, ""Wolves look spooky"".    2017-18: Butler with a young Wiggins and Towns, ""Wolves look spooky"".    2018-19: Still have the same core from the previous year to start the season. Before the locker room issues became headline news, nephews said ""Wolves look spooky"".    2019-20: 23 year-old Malik Beasley and DeAngelo Russel, with 24 year-old Towns, ""Wolves look spooky"".     2020-21: Beasley, Russel, and Towns with first round pick Anthony Edwards, ""Wolves look spooky"".    Sure, the phrase has normally been used sarcastically, but the only reason it's continued to have relevance is because nephews continually believe it to be true. Timberwolves are perpetually 2-3 years from contending, and their fans let us know about it every year."
"You’re assuming she doesn’t love basketball and doesn’t see being “professional” as an asset that’ll help her move towards her dream. I wonder why that might be.   The same people that shit on players (like Anthony Edwards) for saying the wrong thing, also shit on the parents of potential players for getting their (extremely talented) kids media training before an interview on national TV. Do you think that starts when you get drafted at 19? The point is to have poise and professionalism before you get to the big stage and instead of celebrating a young girl whose chasing her dream, you turn what’s likely one of the best moments of her life, into a soap box to preach your own moral superiority from. You’ve made multiple negative assumptions, from a perspective of complete ignorance, just to stroke your own dick on this internet. It’s pathetic."

"Given a vote today, I’d pick Anthony edwards, but Tate 100% deserves to be in the conversation, and it’s hard to put everything he does into a box score. It’s closer than you think"
"i swear i'm not just saying this because i like jae'sean tate but it's anthony edwards for me  before i get pushback let me make it clear that he's very good for a rookie! he is! but i still think people are actively overrating him based on stuff like The Dunk and his other highlight dunks etc. when honestly every time i watch him (which is more frequent than you might expect, cause i love the t-wolves announcers) i just don't understand how people so heavily overrate the player he is *right now* (not who he might become, which is a very scary player and all-time freak athlete) with his horrific efficiency. As he is rn it's the definition of empty stats. :/"
If Anthony Edwards did that dunk you would have gotten him to enthusiastically tell you an Ant (the animal not the player)fact

Reminds me of the days Wally Szczberiak used to be the Jazz killer and find a way to beat us year after year. Anthony Edwards may be the new Jazz killer 😬
The minnesota timberwolves. We have anthony edwards and you will never be called a fair weather fan. Who doesn't like to root for an underdog?
Some dude put exactly what I wrote in another Anthony Edwards post a couple weeks ago
"Drafting for fit is a mistake if you take a poorly rated player instead of who's on the board. But drafting BPA when it's a bad fit can set guys up for failure, too. I don't really see the point in drafting an athletic, raw forward with high upside when he doesn't fit at all. Kuminga needs the ball to play his game and develop. His effort on defense is super inconsistent. Adding him to a team with two young budding offensive stars makes no sense for him or the team we already have. There are wing players that offer defense and complimentary offense and I would want any of them over Kuminga. I also just don't like Kuminga tbh. Had we been in the draft last year a couple spots higher I wouldn't have wanted anthony edwards either. It would mean blowing up the team and their talent doesn't warrant that."
"Man I don't know how else to say this or put it nicely but anyone thinking wasting Steph's best years to develop Wiseman is just a fucking moron. Every single minute of this guy counts. He is a generational talent. Your team is not Wolves, moreover Wiseman is not even Anthony Edwards. Let's say at best his potential is to be someone at Steph's level player which you already have! I just don't understand this."
Anthony Edwards “ah-hyuck”
You do realize I was specifically pointing out that he was not ranked as the top rank talent right? That was Anthony Edwards. Your direct quote:   “LaMelo Ball had been the #1 talent guy in the draft for months”

7 footers take vastly more time to develop into productive players. Anthony Edwards is on a team that’s on a way different situation than the warriors. Anthony Edwards doesn’t play with Steph Curry and so he can be the sole focus of scoring besides from DLo. Also the twolves are last in the west. So idk what your point is here.
How's Anthony Edwards doing
"It’s true, Anthony Edwards personally pays me to downvote his haters on reddit"
"Yep! He was the runaway favorite before the injury that was thought to be season needing which just adds to his story since he’ll prolly pass the min % of games played for Roy, and even tho ant has been great since post all star but he hasn’t done enough to steal it considering his first half, and Halliburton just hasn’t taken off enough to take it either    Source for betting odds: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10001790-lamelo-ball-betting-favorite-to-win-2021-nba-roy-over-anthony-edwards-despite-injury"
Or Anthony edwards
They did what?? C'mon man Trae has literally made fewer 3s than Anthony Edwards this year. He's made less than half as many as Steph
"Ok, harden in 2015 was the second highest scorer in the league. Donovan mitchell is 11th this year. You’re committing the same error people make when they compare true shooting percentages across eras. A lot has changed in basketball since warriors mania.   I never said Donovan mitchell will not improve, but there are a lot of players that are also young that are more likely to be the next generation of “super stars.” Luka and giannis are already superstars. Zion already seems more likely to be a super star than mitchell. To name a few others, we got Devin booker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Ja Morant, and then a few more that I really think will be better even though there’s not a lot to go on I.e. lamelo ball and Michael Porter jr. Not to mention there will be more and more players pouring into the league, other guys that improve as well like maybe Anthony Edwards, and some current super stars that are still decently young like Anthony Davis and will be taking up those spots for the next while in Mitchell’s career.   Basically, I don’t really believe mitchell will ever be a borderline top 5 player and I actually believe he’ll probably stay at around 15-20 for most of his career  Edit: ad is actually 28, but there’s others like jokic that are 26 and will be considered better than mitchell for like the next 6 to 8 years probably"
Does Anthony Edwards not exist all of the sudden? He's also having a good rookie year and they have their PG in D-Lo.
"“The earth (ain’t) round. Or flat. It’s a doughnut.  Look it up.   ...deada$$”  -Anthony Edwards, November 27th, 2024"
Outside of LaMelo and Anthony Edwards the draft was kind of a bust. Wiseman has under performed and usually there’s a couple later 1st round breakout stars but there really aren’t any from this draft. Overall a bit disappointing
Anthony edwards is gonna be superstar  Devon Mitchell will finish his career being in the goat conversation
"It'll be interesting to see what your organization does with that team.  I feel like it may be time to trade KAT and start a rebuild around Anthony Edwards.  Hopefully you guys keep this years draft pick.  I don't think anyone wants to see the warriors with another top pick.    Yeah Randle has been incredible.  I'm not used to expecting to win games, it's been so long since we've been good.  Feels completely different that the Carmelo years too, we can keep building.  Amazing how quick things can change."
Because they don’t realize efficiency isn’t the best way to judge young guards entering the league. Especially when they’re on shitty teams with horrible spacing. I watched one full lamello ball nbl game and could tell he was gonna he good.yeah he shot like 5-13 from three but you could see he was talented and that he just needed slightly better form and better shot selection. Same goes for guys like Anthony Edwards and rj Barrett.

But he has about the same amount of post high school game experience as Anthony Edwards. He’s still extremely inexperienced and the fact he’s this good already is nuts
"Yeah just talking about offense. But MPJ certainly has the physical tools to be an incredibly good defensively and has certainly showed the ability to learn quickly. I mean, the dude has barely played more basketball games since high school than Anthony Edwards has, and has already improved this much. Plus, he has shown all the signs of becoming the ideal type of weakside PF shot blocker that we could use to supplement Jokic’s rim protection. Having a PF with the ability to get 2+ blocks a game down the road is the difference between having jokic and a legit good rim protector at the 5 defensively."
"We'll think about it for KAT, Anthony Edwards, and Kirill Kaprisov."
"MPJ’s on ball defense is somewhat decent now, and his weak side help/shotblocking D has gotten quite good. He still gets burn on backcuts and stuff but the improvement is insane and he’s better pretty much every night, if you haven’t watched him recently you might not realize how much better he is than he was in eg the playoffs last year.    Remember that this guy has played almost the same number of basketball games since high school as Anthony Edwards."
"Why do people shit on Anthony Edwards so much, he seems like a fine prospect?"
Anthony edwards with the 23 9 4 and 5
That Anthony Edwards steal was the game winner
"A ton of teams want Wiseman lmao, this sub really doesn’t understand nuance.  There are a TON of rookies that are net negatives every year, including leading RoTY candidate Anthony Edwards.  Wiseman is a 7 footer with guard speed, the makings of a jump shot, and top 5 among rookies in scoring. Yet he has 0 value because he’s a net negative on a playoff team (which 90% of rookies are)."
that supporting cast is really that bad. maybe anthony edwards improves tho
yeah anthony edwards will just force out next. at some point you gotta stop tanking and try.
"I am a simple man. When I see Anthony Edwards, I upvote.  Edit: bonus bold prediction:   Wolves trade for Ben Simmons during training camp and earn a top 6 playoff seed in the west with a far more balanced roster."
"I don't believe WS/Year is the best metric, and it shows at both ends of the spectrum, with Anthony Edwards, and Dwight Howard.  Who at the ends of their carrer weren't powerhouses.  You don't draft 1st  picks for them to be ""decent career long contributors"" You draft them to put you over the top.  We judge stars and busts largely based on how they were at their peak.  Your ranking drags down guys like Howard a lot simply because they are playing past their peak.  And it overvalues guys like Bogut for average play for a long time.  A guy like Ben Simmons shouldn't be ranked above Blake Griffin.  Simmons' best year would be Blake's 5th best. Simmons' 3rd best year would be Blake's 8th best year.  We still debate if Simmons is a bust.  Nobody does that with Blake.   Yeah, Simmons hasn't played as long, but his peak isn't close to Blake's.     IMO, the better measure is something like Baseball's [JAWS](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/miscellaneous/jaws) (for evaluating HOF)  Thus a simple metric might be    - Average WS of best 6 seasons   Or    - (Average WS of best 6 seasons  + TOTAL Carrer WS) / 2  Depending on how much weight *longevity* has in your mind for determining a bust."
I agree. It was too small a sample size to really determine anything with Anthony Edwards
Guards and wings aren’t mutually exclusive.   Zach Lavine is a guard and a wing.   Cam Reddish is a guard and a wing  Anthony Edwards is a guard and a wing

Anthony Edwards highlights (z highlights only)
Anthony Edwards just turned 20 3 weeks ago and averaged 24 on 57TS in his last 36 games of the season and the wolves actually won more games in that span and he also has 3 more years on a rookie scale contract. Why would the Wolves trade him and additional assets for Ben Simmons and some role players? The only player on the sixers roster who i would give up Edwards for is Embiid
Anthony Edwards not getting traded.
"Anthony Edwards has superstar potential and just turned 20 3 weeks ago, there are no additional assets the Sixers have that would make the Wolves trade Edwards especially since they would have to include Beverley and Beasley on top of edwards to match salary"
Luka. Anthony Edwards is really fun to watch.
"Half of the comments are Luka lol. I like my point guards, so I'll go with Kyrie and Trae. Anthony Edwards is someone I want to watch this year. Fun personality and reminds me of old Wade."
Anthony Edwards is a treasure.  People got their panties in a bunch with that pre-draft quote must feel like they understand him a lot better by now.
"Probably curry for a few years, I really like Ja too, and Anthony edwards"

"The timberwolves need to trade D Lo for Ben Simmons, I don’t think D  Lo and KAT will ever bring out the best in each other because they’re best friends and they’re too comfortable around each other. Anthony Edwards has no business playing small forward and a core of A1, Ben Simmons and has a lot more defensive potential than D Lo, A1 and KAT."
Both are still 24 and 25. Still young.   Anthony Edwards is coming of a ROY type season.   Malik Beasley is only 24 coming off of averaging 19 a game.   I think they trade one of D-Lo and Beasley tho.
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
"Other big clients are AD, ben simmons, draymond green, Anthony edwards, and John wall for those wondering"
"Trae is a Klutch guy, but represented by [Omar Wilkes](https://basketball.realgm.com/info/agent_clients/Omar-Wilkes/731).

"crazy that getting injured affected Mutombo's chances, but Lamelo ball getting injured and also having worse stats than Anthony Edwards didn't stop him from winning ROTY"

Anthony Edwards
Just look up Anthony Edwards. The Timberwolves welcome your support. 🐺
Will give John Collins and deandre Hunter for Anthony edwards and KAT and 32 first round picks
"&gt;Why did you trade for him in the first place exactly?   To mentor Anthony Edwards and have a high quality backup PG, he was also part of the Jaden McDaniels trade which was very valuable.   Rosas also wanted to keep his money on the books for one more year since James Johnson was an expiring."
Anthony Edwards
Superstar is a nebulous term but typically reserved for the best of the best. Anthony Edwards is a nice player and I think he's shown enough to believe he'll have a successful career. But he'll need to show much more before we use a word like superstar.   What is their cap situation like? Didn't they give Malik a big contract last year?
"Brogdan alone is better than Ben for most teams. I realize Ben should be worth more, but he really isn't in most cases. Literally the only teams he has that type of value for are teams with centers who are good to elite shooters. That basically limits it to Indiana and Minnesota for now (the Bucks would also fit the bill if Giannis didn't exist to be fair).   With Indiana, they'd also be burdened with moving Sabonis, which lowers his value in their eyes. That's a really big ask.   With Minnesota, they can't really move D'Lo due to the risk of upsetting KAT, and Anthony Edwards is on the fast track into being a star, so it'd be dumb to move him for someone with a lower ceiling.   I hate to say it, but Brogdan and a pick might be the best offer for a long time."
"Hey you drafted KAT and Anthony Edwards right? They are both *number 1* picks.   You have D'Lo, who is a number 2 pick, that you got from trading a number 1 pick.  Kings have not gotten a number 1 pick since early 90's despite ""being bad"" all this time. Yes we got the number 2 in 2018 and blew it, but that is about all we got.  My point is it is just kinda amazing how teams like the Timberwolves and Cleveland and Phoenix for awhile can always be in the 1-5 range year after year."
"&gt; 2020: #1 Anthony Edwards (got an issue with that? I didn't think so)  &gt; Get your facts straight.  This is a new breed of the timberwolf, aggressive, snarky, little annoying -- i think i've only seen sad, self-deprecating wolves around here"
Incorrect.  2021: #7 traded for D'Lo  2020: #1 Anthony Edwards (got an issue with that? I didn't think so)  2019: #6 Jarrett Culver  2018: #20 Josh Okogie  2017: #7 traded for traded for Jimmy Butler)  So we have had a top ten pick four times in five years. One was used on Anthony Edwards and another two were traded for D'Lo and Jimmy Butler.   Get your facts straight.
at least the wolves have thicc anthony edwards
"&gt; Paul Rudd is 52 and plays Ant-Man.  Yes, but he's 32 years older than Anthony ""Ant-Man"" Edwards."
Anthony Edwards lol
"I think Memphis would be a great choice, they have a lot of players that play hard and are fun to watch.      Here's my pitch for the Timberwolves:      The Timberwolves have the youngest team in the league with a new coach that seems good, so they have a lot of potential to improve. They historically haven't been good so they are underdogs and it could be fun to watch them prove people wrong. They have several exciting offensive players and a few good high effort defenders. The young players have fun playing with each other, which makes watching more enjoyable. Anthony Edwards is only 19 and is a rising star that is super charismatic on and off the court.      Here are some videos you could watch to learn more:      [This is a funny fan made video about some of the players](https://np.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/ofn0u1/the_dk_rap_but_its_the_minnesota_timberwolves/)      [The team posts videos that give a behind-the-scenes look at the team, here is the most recent one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EcchaWtqR4)      [Here are some Anthony Edwards interview moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LhMUEOoTeM)"
Anthony Edwards vibes too 😂
Can we ask Anthony Edwards these questions as well? I'm really interested lol.
Their defence will definitely suck if they try starting Anthony Edwards twice
"You also have the hindsight of seeing Ant in the NBA while we haven't seen Green yet, but Post ASB, over 50% of his 20+ ft shots were assisted, he wasn't an offensive initiator outside of his rim drives - that's what im saying.   1/3rd of every shot was a Corner 3 (28% of all FG% was a corner 3)  He only shot 26% from the mid range on low volume (disclaimer: sample size issue)  He actually shot 38.7% from 3 on pullups Post-ASB which is actually better than what I saw on the tape (again I'm going off my own eye test here which is definitely fallible, which is why i qualifed it that it s just my 2c, I didn't pull up a bball ref page before this), but if you break it down further, over 50% of those shots came with the closest defender being 4+ feet away, so yeah a lot of those pullups were wide open.  We can actually break it down even further when Dlo was on vs off - when Dlo was on 73% of his shots were assists (which makes sense, Dlo is the one bringing the ball up the court) and shot 36% from 3. When Dlo came off, Anthony Edwards' 3p shot 31.9% from 3, and obviously the ast% dropped to 59%. So even when Dlo wasn't on, he wasn't initiating halfcourt offense the majority of his time on the court.  I actually agree with you digging into this that his pullup % has actually improved a lot since getting into the NBA (and I'm sorry about that), but I think its clear from the data  and from what I watched that he was a great scorer when facilitated, but he wasnt the intiator that I expect Green to be. Again, just my 2c"
"They're here for everyone's entertainment. That'd be a fun team to watch score 150 and still lose by 10 until at least three of those players get hurt four games into the season.  Also, I just now saw that you've got Anthony Edwards playing two positions. Talented kid."
"&gt;I'd be curious for some unbiased comparisons between Ant Edwards and Jalen Green?   Full disclosure: I was pretty low on Ant last year and pretty high on Jalen Green this year and it primarily has to do with feel for the game. I think Jalen Green is a tier higher as a prospect than Anthony Edwards ever was.  Both are 90+ percentile on athletes in the NBA. Anthony Edwards is about 25 pounds heavier than where Jalen Green is coming from which matters when the game gets physical. In terms of posters or /r/nba highlight plays, I'm not sure we're going to get as many of them from Jalen Green as we did Edwards.  However, as prospects, I dont think the mental side of the game is that close. I think right out of the game, Jalen Green is going to be the type to be able take the ball up to halfcourt and be that much more deadlier in ISO or initiating a play. I think his first step is stronger and he will not be forced into settling for as many mid-range jumpers. He has a more advanced handle and is just in general going to be better at creating advantages and opening up lanes in the defense in a 5v5 game. I think his stepback off the dribble when a defender sticks to him is just significantly better. I dont think we're going to see a 49% eFG rookie season from Green.  This really isn't me shitting on Edwards, I just think Green is a really special player. If we didn't know what we knew about Edwards' rookie seasons, there are still a lot of red flags from his college season at Georgia that he still hasn't ironed out that Green simply doesnt have in his game. Just my 2c."
"RJ Barrett. Jaden McDaniels.   Anthony Edwards will be a legitimate all star and the Wolves will fight for a play-in where nobody wants to play them.   Also not star, but as a role player Aaron Nesmith is going to surprise a lot of people. Think Danny Green esque role player."
Anthony Edwards jumping to all star status 🐺
Anthony Edwards
"Haliburton definitely has the potential to be an all star player, but I just don’t see the Kings ever having a record that allows him to get accolades like that. I hope I’m proven wrong, because I have nothing but love for the Sac fan base and they deserve some relief.   Cole Anthony and Killian Hayes are pretty volatile in my opinion, have potential to be pretty good, but could also just as easily bust. I’m super interested this season to see how they perform. Especially with Cade and Killian on the same court. Same goes with Immanuel Quickley, love that dude, I hope he continues to improve and just balls out.   Wiseman is being written off as a bust already and it’s so unbelievably premature. I think he has a ton of potential and a fantastic opportunity to improve and achieve. Of course, he could end up as a Bagley-esque player, but it’s too early, imho, to say he’s a bust.   In my opinion, I just think it’s a little early to call it for anyone, except for LaMelo, Edwards, and Haliburton. But even those three, I have a feeling, will have a sophomore slump, and any dip statistically is going to bring out the critics who haven’t been as vocal this season."
"What future? They didn’t draft LaMelo Ball or Anthony Edwards. Wiseman was historically bad his rookie season, the chances of him developing into a top 10 player are slim to none.  If you have a top 5 player you always go all in. It’s possible to trade for useful vets instead of surrounding Curry with 18 year olds, it doesn’t have to be a superstar."
I did it with current players    Russ 6’3  Kyrie Irving 6’2  Anthony Edwards 6’4  Harden 6’5  Draymond 6’6   Not the best but probably fun to watch
Anthony Edwards is gonna make the league remember.
The Anthony Edwards special! If ESPN didn't correctly predict the pick then create a stupid narrative so they look like they're still big brains. (i.e. Edwards doesn't love basketball because he doesn't devote all his free time to it).
"Dope: Steph Curry, Luka, Dame, Giannis, Tre Young, Joel Embiid and Jokic  Nope: Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, and Kristaps Porzingis   Hope: Zion, Cade Cunningham, Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, and Bruno Caboclo (forever).   Heroes: Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Giannis x2, and Boban Marjanovic  Villains: Patrick Beverly, James Harden x2, Kevin Durant sometimes, and Jaxson Hayes  Current Old Guard: Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul  These are probably the most mentioned names on this sub and the most talked about players. I'm missing a bunch of stars, but these are the people that seem to garner the most attention. The forewords of each list isn't all encompassing, just a meme. The nope category is filled with all stars and a first ballot hall of famer for example."
"You really said Siakam was worth Anthony Edwards &amp; filler… like bro just turn in your basketball card. Who’s biased? 🤦🏻‍♂️ anyways it’s Friday, not gonna waste it talking to a brick wall. Say goodbye to Siakam and enjoy Kuzma + Rui"

"PG - Trae, Ja, Fox, LaMelo, Lonzo, Sexton, DeJounte Murray, Haliburton SG - Booker, Mitchell, Brown, Anthony Edwards SF - Ingram, Mikal Bridges PF - Zion, Tatum, John Collins, MPJ C - Bam, JJJ, Jarrett Allen, Mitchell Robinson  Bro, you need shooting you have Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry, Joe Harris... I know these guys aren't young, but you telling me you can't sell a single one of these dudes on the idea of an Olympic experience and gold medal? What, Duncan Robinson would rather do podcasts from his bedroom?  All under 25 years old... I'm sure i left off quite a few good young role players too... if you can't win with these cats against teams led bt 42-year old Scola and Pau then you deserved to get fired and never near a basketball court again in your life...  These excuses are getting ridiculous."
"I agree partially, this is best suited to evaluate the sum of a players career.   It messes up slightly with rookies like Anthony Edwards because he could hypothetically take a huge jump next season while Yao Ming can’t."
I feel like Jalen Green vs Anthony Edwards is a much better question to ask
"Woof, that's a hard thing to come up with off the top of my head. I will say I think Zion and Luka are the only prospects of the last few year I think would find their way up here. Anthony Edwards wasn't as hyped as these guys this year, but I personally was then, and still am, super bullish on Edwards being a future Hall of Famer."
"Problem for the Wolves is that their big asset is Anthony Edwards, who is good but absolutely does not fit the Sixers’ timeline. However, if they’re willing to give up Edwards in a Simmons deal, you can definitely involve a third team but reports just make this all sound unlikely.   The framework I posted here the other day that just needs filler to work is something like:  Sixers get: SGA and Rubio  OKC gets: Edwards  Minn gets: Simmons  Then add picks and pieces until it works (you can add Maxey or Thybulle and the salaries still work).   I think this works for everyone. Sixers get a PG and backup PG and have a starting lineup of Embiid/Harris/Kork(?tbd)/Curry/SGA with Danny Green, Shake, Dwight, and Maxey/Thybulle off the bench. Edwards fits OKC’s timeline way better than SGA at this point and they can get some additional assets. Minnesota gets Simmons who would work well with KAT and Dlo and is reported to be close with them."

Watanabe been practicing for a revenge dunk on Anthony Edwards
ive only seen him get emasculated by anthony edwards so idk
"Minnesota won the trade. They got a playoff appearance out of it (Bulls have yet to even make a play-in tournament without Butler) and with him leaving, they were able to bottom out and get Anthony Edwards who is a much better prospect than Lavine."
"A few better players than PG here taken first, but a “vast majority” aren’t better than him.  2020: Anthony Edwards 2019: Zion Williamson 2018: Deandre Ayton 2017: Markelle Fultz 2016: Ben Simmons 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns 2014: Andrew Wiggins 2013: Anthony Bennett 2012: Anthony Davis 2011: Kyrie Irving 2010: John Wall 2009: Blake Griffin 2008: Derrick Rose 2007: Greg Oden 2006: Andrea Bargnani 2005: Andrew Bogut 2004: Dwight Howard 2003: LeBron James  Yes you’re obviously shooting for the best player, but look at how many misses are there at the first pick. If you have a guaranteed Paul George there at #1, you take him in a typical draft."
Anthony edwards🌚
Or Anthony Edwards for that matter. Though it's looking like Anthony Edwards will be a pretty good pro
Wiseman and Lamelo were thought of as top prospects for a year before the draft. Anthony Edwards stock climbed a lot later in the process and he played for kind of an irrelevant Georgia team as opposed to Duke/Kentucky
Here's a complete list of pieces philly would be willing to accept:  Anthony Edwards.   Who would then be rerouted elsewhere.   Russell is negative value. Putting picks in only offsets his contract. Then it screws up philly's cap sheet. They're not going deep into the tax for DLo.
"This was Anthony Edwards last year, according to half of r/nba"
I want to see how Anthony Edwards and wiseman develope
"&gt; Cunningham also has ""best player on a title team potential""  Last ten number one overall picks:  * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Deandre Ayton * Markelle Fultz * Ben Simmons * Karl-Anthony Towns * Andrew Wiggins * Anthony Bennett * Anthony Davis * Kyrie Irving  The only players on that list who have won a title are Kyrie and Davis, and that's because they played with LeBron James. Who in that group looks like they actually have ""best player on a title team"" potential? Davis, *maybe* Zion, and that's probably it. How many of those players were better than SGA in their third year? Towns, Davis, and Irving?"
"I was going to push back on this, but I looked at the last 10 #1 picks and, you're pretty much right. Wiggins is probably the third worst behind Bennett and Fultz. Ayton and Edwards haven't made all-star teams, but it's pretty reasonable to believe they will, and it's unlikely Wiggins will.  Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Anthony Bennett, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Deandre Ayton, Zion Williamson, Anthony Edwards"
I tried telling people in that overhyped young star thread that SGA isn't some generational superstar you build around but OKC and Canadian fans really want to prop their boy up. Cade and heck even Anthony Edwards has already surpassed him in value and GMs see it. Don't do it Pistons.
Anthony Edwards
"RJ Barrett and to a lesser extent Anthony Edwards. I don’t think either guy is bad, but I just don’t see either guy being a top-2 guy on a championship roster.   Barrett is a pretty awful finisher, doesn’t take many 3s and his defense isn’t much to write home about. I see a high end outcome as DeMar DeRozan for him.   As for Edwards, it’s a similar thing, although I see his athleticism helping him a lot more.  Basically, if a guy’s only premiere attribute is scoring, they better be damn amazing at it if they want to be a superstar."
Well Anthony Edwards is goated so
"Anthony Edwards is going to become a TMZ, movie, and rap star."
I was hearing about Cade before Anthony Edwards declared for the draft
Anthony Edwards scored 28 a game but didn't make all nba?
"Anthony Edwards, Larry bird, Lebron James, jerry west, shaquille o Neale, John wall, Pete Maravich . Just some off the top of my head who have a lot of wow moments, especially bird"
"In between anthony edwards two 40+ point games this year.     The first was a 42 point performance on worse efficiency, but resulted in a win over the Western Conference champion suns    The second was a 42 point game on amazing efficiency (17 for 22 FG, 8 for 9 from 3, 6 rebounds, a steal and a block), but resulted in a 4 point loss to the grizzlies due to the entire bench unit shitting it up.    So i guess the first is my favorite and the second is his best"
"Clown on me all you want, but Anthony Edwards, Zion, Fultz, Simmons, KAT, and AD didn’t do anything close to those things."
"I think he's probably the most athletic person born on  planet earth in the last 100 years after Bo and Jim Thorpe. I also think beyond Wilt he's the most talented player in NBA history. There's a lot of guys with Jordan's profile as an athlete (ie Kobe, Anthony edwards, Wiggins) and I think although KD and Kareem are much more talented offensively they dont have the complete game of lbj"
"Look at anthony edwards.. he was like 4th option when team was healthy and was usually just standing in corner most of the time but he just used it to get better.. that boy has incredible mindset to back up his unlimited talent, unlike wiggs"
"Going bold  **Jayson Tatum** \- Best 2-way player in the NBA  **Luka Doncic** \- In the middle of his prime, probably doing historical things  **Zion Williamson** \- One of the most dominant drivers to the rim ever, hes gonna be a monster scorer in his prime  **Giannis Antetokounmpo** \- In the Latter half of his prime, but still doing Giannis things  **Trae Young** \- Arguably the best Scorer in the NBA  **Anthony Edwards** \- He will be having crazy scoring seasons and his frame makes him a scary slasher at the rim  **Paolo Banchero** \- Bold take, I think its the #1 pick in 2022 Draft, he will be a dominant 2-way player like AD  **Cade Cunningham** \- 2-Way Superstar, best playmaker in the league   **Donovan Mitchell** \- In the midst of his prime, I think he shifts into taking less drives and shooting more.  **Jalen Green** \- Explosive Young PG like athlete, he develops into a 2-Way Superstar as well  &amp;#x200B;  HM: Ja Morant, Devin Booker, Emoni Bates, Jaden Hardy, Lamelo Ball"
"I think our best case scenario is that a star demands a trade and we make a three team deal.    An example of what I mean (you can swap out different teams and players, just showing a structure):  Minnesota:  Ben Simmons  Sixers:  Dame Lillard  Blazers:  Anthony Edwards, Malik Beasley, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey and whole bunch of Minnesota and Philadelphia draft picks  This of course assumes that the blazers/Wizards/other team are going to blow up their roster and are in asset acquisition mode."
PG Luka  SG Anthony Edwards  SF Klay  PF Giannis  C Jokic
i’d say anthony edwards but i see it in Philly Cheese
"What I did was watch Nba highlights on youtube, and just followed players I found entertaining. From there I just supported my favorite players team, which was Westbrook and the thunder.   But if you dont wanna do that, here are some good teams you could support:  Bucks: just won the finals, Giannis is pretty entertaining and they’ll be good for many years  Mavs: Luka Doncic is one of the best already at a very young age, has potential to be an alltime great  Nets: KD, Kyrie, Harden, all very entertaining. You would be supporting a superteam though, and they wont be around for many years  Pistons: #1 pick in this years draft, probably gonna draft Cade Cunningham  Thunder: Thousands of draft picks, and have an amazing young talent in Shai Gilgeous Alexander  Lakers: Lebron  Timberwolves: Have been bad for a while, but with Anthony Edwards entering his second year and KAT at center, they are starting to show some promise.  Obviously there are tons of other fun teams in the league, but these are some that I personally think would be fun to support. Enjoy!"
Anthony edwards Patrick williams Tatum Yup thats pretty much it..
I think you meant KAT and Anthony Edwards
"the man won himself a fuckin championship.  This is the most impressive performance ive seen in a long time, and i love the shit out of this man.  He worked hard, played far harder than anyone else, and always speaks of such wisdom and patience.  I consider him on par with Anthony Edwards (i love his personality) to me in who i want to support and cheer for in this league going forward"
"I can hear Anthony Edwards' screams right now.  I can't tell if they're screams of joy or pain, but he's definitely screaming."
"I don’t think it’s so clear-cut. Anthony Edwards, for example, was -8.3 points per game last season. The wolves overall were -5.6. So they were worse with him on the floor. You sure you wouldn’t prefer a guaranteed +3 player?"
It would be to temper wolves to trade Anthony edwards for ben Simmons.
So you’re telling me Philly would be sending Simmons and Maxey for who exactly? Simmons is not less valuable than Anthony Edwards…
1. Zion  2. Anthony Edwards  3. Cade Cunningham  4. Ja Morant  5. Jalen Green  6. LaMelo Ball
Anthony Edwards. 🐺
Anthony Edwards his first 64 games of the season.  18/4.5/3  on 40/32/71   I can do it too lol.
"Anthony edwards sucked for a lot of the year , so yeah"
The same reason why people mentioning Anthony Edwards.
"Anthony Edwards, Isaiah Stewart, Tyrese Haliburton, Killian Hayes, Tyrese Maxey, Xavier Tillman, Isaac Okoro  I’m not sure if what to expect from Poku this season, but I’m really rooting for him and hoping he makes a jump this season"
Anthony Edwards I think easily.  24-27 PPG in the second half of the season once he got a better coach and the team was sort of healthy. He was going nuts.
1. Zion   2. Cade Cunningham   3. Jalen Green (A lot of teams would of taken him #1 instead of Cade)   4. Ja Morant  ( Wasn't a great prospect was clearly ahead of Barrett though. It was a perceived weak draft class at the time which might have been correct.)   5. Anthony Edwards (At the time he wasn't unanimous)   6. Lamelo Ball (Dropped because of Lamar and Lonzo Ball nothing would of changed)
"Anthony Edwards, he can do anything."
Anthony Edwards actually wins but the media give the prize to Lamelo Ball
Anthony Edwards
"It is really a tough situation for Philly now. No one is going to offer more. Without Simmons, you are still a top team. Why let this be a distraction? Every game will have someone ask the players about Ben. Just get it over with. Get anthony edwards or sexland for Simmons and you are good to go."
"This comment is basically exactly what I was thinking when reading OP's post. The fact that 5 rings, 2 MVPs, and 3 finals MVPs (Duncan) is DEBATABLY not top-10  makes it hard as hell for me to sit here and claim that even someone who has the word ""freak"" in their nickname is likely to make the list.   If the top 10 was purely based on the ""eye test"", then Giannis would be a pretty good bet. But given that it's a designation that relies on sustained greatness as well as team success, then it's almost impossibly hard to say at this point for most people in the league.     Others have commented that Anthony Edwards is that guy. But for me, if you line him up with Kobe (who is arguably not in the top-10), I have to ask myself, ""Is it very likely that he will have as good of a career as Kobe?"" Very doubtful, given that that requires not just talent, but a lot of luck. And if that's the case, then how much harder is it to suggest he's going to have a \*better\* career than Kobe? The probability of that seems far less than 51%, which is the minimum it would take to say it's likelier than not."
"Anthony Edwards. Obviously he has a long way to go, but I think there's a non-zero chance he winds up in GOAT discussions"
Antman AND Naz Reid confirmed top 10 all time.  1) Naz Reid  2) Anthony Edwards  3) Naz Reid  4) Anthony Edwards  5) Naz Reid  6) Anthony Edwards  7) Naz Reid  8) Anthony Edwards  9) Naz Reid  10) Anthony Edwards  They're not in the top 10. They are the top 10.
Anthony Edwards got compared to Oladipo and Eric Gordon
Anthony Edwards tbh.  People here talk about him as a shoe-in to be a star but I dont see it yet
"&gt; This includes MANY #1 picks.   I'd go beyond that. It includes almost all #1 picks in recent history:  * 2013 - Anthony Bennett was never the priority over Kyrie, traded soon after * 2014 - Andrew Wiggins was immediately traded, and after Wiggins' first year, KAT was the priority * 2015 - KAT, an exception * 2016 - Ben Simmons, whose team has at least clearly tried to make him guy 1B and has consistently campaigned for him to win awards and tried to get him to step up and do more so he CAN be the priority * 2017 - Markelle Fultz, everyone knows this one * 2018 - Deandre Ayton, obviously behind Booker always * 2019 - Zion, duh * 2020 - Anthony Edwards, behind KAT  So, 8 #1 picks, only 2 of whom were the priority on their teams"
"Giannis and Jokic are the perfect front court duo honestly. They play off each other so well. However, they're both worth 5$ so im only left with 5$.   Looking at the list I have my bigs so I only need guards. I want a good scoring wing who can also defend so I settled on Edwards. He also has great potential to develop into an elite 2 way player  I only have 2$ now for my backcourt so Ill chose Lonzo Ball and Gary Trent Jr. Lonzo is an elite shooter and defender while Gary Trent even has some creating ability though I will mainly use him as a shooter. He's not the greatest defender but I have Lonzo and Edwards to cover for him  All this floor spacing should maximize Giannis and Edwards slashing ability and Jokic's playmaking will be deadly with these guys, especially since all of them are great off ball. KAT already plays a similar role in Minnesota with Edwards and Jokic is just an upgrade  So my team is  PG: Lonzo  SG: Gary Trent  SF: Anthony Edwards  PF: Giannis  C: Jokic"
Lamelo Ball  Gary Trent Jr.  Anthony Edwards  Jayson Tatum  Nikola Jokic
"There is generally a league consensus when someone like LeBron or Tim Duncan is available, and those teams would never trade their #1 pick. Some players are close, like Zion, but not there. In a normal year though, there is plenty of debate about Fultz vs. Ball vs. Tatum or Anthony Edwards vs. Ball or whatever.   Basically Hinkie’s rule would be to not trade multiple lottery picks for one higher pick, since like you said it’s pretty random.   Saying that his rule is dumb because he would obviously break it to trade for a LeBron level prospect is irrelevant because a LeBron level prospect (ie. Basically guaranteed to be a star) would never be available for that price"
"It's probably a myth but one could argue it holds some ground as well. I think the poster used the wrong term or context, but I do agree with his point on Anthony Edwards and Lamelo ball. MVP and rookie of the year aren't comparable though so my input may hold no merit. The league is always looking for the next big thing, it's subjective and every fan/fan base is going to  feel a certain type of way"
"Anthony Edwards is already very good at finishing around the basket. He is going to be one of the best at the league at driving and finishing.   Anthony Edwards within 4 feet of the rim in 2020-21, by month:  - December/January: 43.5% (30/69) - February: 54.4% (43/79) - March: 61.4% (51/83) - April: 61.8% (63/102) - May: 69.8% (37/53)"
Idk if I would describe his tweets as content necessarily but Tyler Tynes is a cool follow. He's at GQ now. His interviews with players are pretty great as well. There's a great Anthony Edwards quote I can't remember at present from one though.
Under no circumstances should they even consider giving up Anthony Edwards for anybody that's available
"Don't forget our resident football/rap enthusiast Anthony ""doesn't care about basketball"" Edwards"
"As far as im concerned Anthony Edwards is a better dunker than this dude, already has top 3 dunk of the past 10 years on that Japanese dude I forget his name"
Anthony Edwards charm
I'd rather have Anthony Edwards in this group and drop KAT. Don't need KAT if you have Joker. Jingles over Mitchell. Don't need Mitchell if you have Dame/Ant backcourt.
"Honestly, that's why I'm taking Anthony Edwards over KAT. Joe Ingles over Donovan Mitchell. It's not ultimately who's the BEST player. Gotta look at the group on the floor.   Run Dame at PG, Ant at SG, SGA at F, Jingles at F and Joker at C."
"Battle between Pacific and Northwest. For the Northwest division I'd do:   Damian Lillard, Anthony Edwards, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Joe Ingles, and Nikola Jokic."
"Strangely think the samething that happened when Dwayne Wade flying elbowed Stephenson. Absoulute nothing besides a fine. If Lebron punched Anthony Edwards in the mouth then said he was trying to do X which is why he accidentally hit Edwards, all the media would buy it."
"So I went and looked at current MVP odds to see who was furthest down the list that I could actually see winning. My answer is Karl Anthony-Towns at 100-1.  My thinking:  1) He’s already established that he can put up the requisite numbers.  2) Because of his heartbreaking real-life tragedies, there’s an easy narrative for him.  3) There’s a non-zero chance the Wolves aren’t terrible. I don’t THINK they’ll be good but the West is in flux at the moment, they’ve got young talent and if they get better injury luck than they’ve had recently, Edwards makes a second year leap and they step up a little on defense, I could see them being surprisingly good.  I’m not predicting this, but if you’re looking for a real Dark Horse who isn’t one of the same 3 guys that are always mentioned whenever this question is asked, that’s my answer."
Fr 6ers are getting back D-Lo and Anthony Edwards for Simmons in 2k
2016: Kris Dunn to Buddy Hield  2017: Lauri Maurkennen to Frank Ntilikina   2018: None  2019: Jarrett Culver to Coby White  2020: Anthony Edwards to James Wiseman
"Young Shaq on the Orlando Magic originally, and then Kevin Garnett once the Wolves drafted him. I took about a decade off from caring about the game and then Anthony Edwards got me back into things again. And oddly enough, getting back into basketball cards this past year helped my enthusiasm greatly."
Anthony Edwards vs Kevin Porter Jr. 6'6 standoff in the conference finals this season
"The report seems pretty clear that if the Sixers ask for an unreasonable price (e.g., Anthony Edwards) the FO is comfortable running it back with our current roster. I'm not sure why you're talking about DeAngelo Russell and speculating about irrelevant shit. We are talking about Anthony Edwards, who is more valuable of an asset (read: not a better player) than Ben Simmons right now"
That doesn't seem like a better deal for Philadelphia than what they could get now. Those Minnesota picks are not a good bet to be very high if they have KAT/DLo/Anthony Edwards/Simmons.
Tatum  Monk  Maxey  Huerter   Bridges  KPJ  Herro  RJ  Anthony Edwards
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."
Notable forwards who are likely All-NBA candidates during MPJ's contract:  * Julius Randle  * Jayson Tatum * Brandon Ingram * Lebron James * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Kevin Durant * Jimmy Butler * Paul George * Domantas Sabonis  He's obviously an offensive juggernaut (his monthly splits in the last 2 months of the season speaks for itself) although is he going to put up those same numbers when Murray is back. The ability isn't being questioned but more so the amount of opportunities to put up All-NBA numbers.
"Anthony Edwards was second in ROTY voting, put up 24/5.3/3.4 on a 45/35 split post-all star break. He *just* turned 20 and also grew about 2 inches. He better be that untouchable."
"“Kevin Durant, cause he’s 7 feet, and can do everything a point guard can do.”  -Anthony Edwards"
"Hmmmm, Anthony Edwards?"
Anthony Edwards is no longer 6’4.
"Ceiling is what makes this answer pretty clear imo.  Anthony Edwards could honestly be very close to Dwyane Wade, there are some difference, Edwards has higher shooting upside because he can shoot 3’s, but Wade was one of the smartest and most cerebral players ever with a an old school KG-Kobe will to win.  Jalen Green has very high upside but it isn’t comparable to any top 30 players of all time.  He could be a top 10 players in the league for sure though."
"Very shortly after LaMelo (frontunner for Rookie of the Year at that point) went down with his wrist injury last season, DLo tweeted “ROY 🥱” about Anthony Edwards"
This just like the ROTY situation when we just found out about Lamelo getting injured and he tweeted “Anthony Edwards ROY 🥱”
"Kris Dunn -&gt; Buddy Hield   Justin Patton -&gt; D.J. Wilson   Josh Okogie -&gt; Grayson Allen   Jarrett Culver -&gt; Coby White   Anthony Edwards -&gt; James Wisemen   Our draft lineup looks real rough… seems like 4 out of the 5 picked one after us were upgrades.  Though, I’d say Ant over Wiseman offsets the difference since he’s already shown flashes of being a franchise player, especially during the second half of his rookie season."
"As the gentleman above me has stated, let’s not put any disrespect on Anthony Edwards"
Not really Anthony Edwards has the same goofy energy and he is from the US
Love Anthony Edwards just all around good guy comes in does his job doesn't complain about his role and tries to help KAT as much as he can
Anthony Edwards is a bust because he prefers MegaBlocks to Legos -r/nba
Anthony Edwards is a bust because he likes football -r/nba
"Anthony Edwards, the football player’s basketball player"
"Yeah, Lillard is one of those potentially disgruntled stars. As you stated, star trades are typically disappointing hauls, so a star swap was within reason if he asked out and the Blazers wanted to remain competitive.      Also, Anthony Edwards is not a mega-star and won’t ever likely turn into one. He’s not even close to the category of Murray, Lillard, Beal in terms of value so I don’t know why you consider that so far-fetched."
"Everytime i see the name Anthony Edwards, I'm thinking Dr Green from ER."
"Allen wasn’t traded for a lotto pick, he was traded for second rounders. My point was to show that Memphis basically gave him away, so trades are clearly possible.  Ofc trades are possible, I can trade you my house for your sandwich! But are they worthwhile? Not with what was available.   &gt; Scottie was rated higher all around the league than Kuminga. The Warriors themselves were going to take him instead of Kuminga if Barnes was available. He’s projected much higher. Please do not act like you actually keep up with the league, this is evident considering you called Scottie a big. He’s a point forward/point guard actually. Kuminga went so low specifically because he is raw and I’m not even talking about summer league.  I didn’t call Barnes a wing I was talking about Wiseman and staring if you were impatient for him I feel for Barnes. Kuminga went 7 and Barnes went 4. That’s not so low. Prospect ranking wise Barnes was 5 and Kuminga is 6. Kuminga actually played in a much better league than Barnes and as we saw with Lamelo Ball, that helps your maturity a ton. But for now Barnes is NBA ready defensively and his passing is good but has no shooting as of now, Kuminga is more raw yes but has shown great flashes. He is not bone raw. Kinda like Anthony Edwards level raw.  Wiggins may have been better offensively but he wasn’t as efficient and the greatest shooter doesn’t make you a lockdown on-ball defender.  &gt; Warriors FO are wasting the tail end of Curry’s prime.  No. Trading your best assets for the next 3 years for a salary dump or a guy like Simmons who makes spacing much  worse on Curry instead of waiting for an actually good fit is wasting the end of his prime."
anthony edwards is worse tyreke evans
"The last twenty (before Cade):  Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Yao Ming, Kwame Brown.   **HOF:** Yao, LeBron, Dwight, Rose are all sure things. I fully expect AD, Kyrie and Zion to get there.   **Franchise Star:** Griffin, Wall, KAT, Simmons, Ant.   **Really Good:** Bogut, Ayton.   **Meh to Complete Bust:** Brown, Bargnani, Oden, Bennett, Fultz.   Looking at it like that you're spot on - someone in that franchise star level is around the median (as opposed to mean)."
1. Cade Cunningham  2. Anthony Edwards 3. LaMelo Ball  4. Jalen Green  5. Evan Mobley  6. Jalen Suggs
How is this even remotely a red flag? Anthony Edwards did the same thing by choosing UGA and he’s turned out well thus far. It’s not like the SEC is void of talent.
Anthony Edwards will be a consensus top 5 player within the first 5 years of his career.
Thats Anthony “Funniest Guy in the League” Edwards
Anthony Edwards will be the best SG in the league one day  There's been such a backlash to Luka being overrated that we're ignoring the fact of how historically great he's been early in his career.  LeBron type shit.  Ja Morant will level off as a 3rd Team All-NBA player at best and will never be the best PG in the league
Anthony Edwards if he doesnt already qualify
Anthony Edwards is already pulling his weight on the team. We don't need to wait for him. And the fact that he's playing well already speaks to how good he is going to be when fully developed. Rather keep him around than throw away a good thing for a temporary low playoff seed like the Timberwolves already did with Zach Lavine.
Anthony Edwards would probably be A1 from Day 1
"If this means Anthony Edwards will be a part of the trade, I'm done with the wolves."
Nice. We will have one Anthony Edwards then
Anthony Edwards is about to take a huge jump.
Simmons is NOT worth Anthony Edwards lmao his future is wayyyy too bright
Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards.  This team causes me so much pain.
"Will come down to Kuminga. Neither D’Lo or Wiggins are great players, so it will come down to whether the Warriors got a good core piece with Kuminga or not.  It’s still a win for the Timberwolves too though. Anthony Edwards will be a Top 10 player in the league, so if D’Lo bought them time to keep KAT happy and not asking out to give time for Edwards to develop, then that in itself is a massive win for the Wolves."
&gt;he's been the 2nd best player of his draft class.  1. LaMelo Ball 2. Anthony Edwards  You think he's better than one of them?

Wait wasn’t everyone was slobbing Anthony Edwards knob when he said the same thing about his teammates a couple weeks ago?
"Should include the number 1 pick, Anthony Edwards is averaging 23.2/8.0/3.0"
"Ja is almost certainly going to take a vacated spot in the West and then you have Brandon Ingram's minutes and rates ticking up a decent bit due to Zion's absence (although the Pelicans poor record may keep him out).   Also, you're most likely going to get at least one of Anthony Edwards or KAT, if not both, if the Timberwolves keep a relatively decent record through the first 2/5 of the season."
"Having Ball's uncanny ability to create for himself and his teammates at his size and frame is a more valuable trait than extreme athleticism.  &gt; it’s the athleticism, coach ability and instinct  All of which Lamelo has, and Lamelo is also ahead of Anthony Edwards in terms of instinct."
I already have last year's Anthony Edwards City jersey and I'm extremely tempted to double up
I told my fellow Bucks Fans the Timberwolves are a good team this year and they thought that I was being ridiculous. Anthony Edwards is leading a talented young team that beat the breaks off us. We're playing with most our top guys hurt but they still had to beat us. Edward averaging 23 PPG this year He's a future Allstar.

He's worse in nigh on every stat bar a marginal lead in FT% and being 0.039 better at a shot which no one shot in large values in LeBron's rookie year.  So no, Anthony Edwards is not better than Rookie LeBron"
Anthony Edwards almost shot a half courter with 4 seconds left because of the shot-clock buzzer lol
I think the better question would’ve been RJ or Anthony Edwards 👀
"For those curious, here's the debut game from the last ten #1 overall picks:  Name | PTS | AST | REB | STL | BLK | FG | FGA | 3P | 3PA | FT | FTA | MP ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- Kyrie Irving | 6 | 7 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 12 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 26:01 Anthony Davis | 21 | 0 | 7 | 1 | 1 | 6 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 9 | 9 | 29:04 Anthony Bennett | 2 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 14:59 Andrew Wiggins | 6 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 9 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 18:33 Karl-Anthony Towns | 14 | 1 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 10 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 31:53 Ben Simmons | 18 | 5 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 7 | 14 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 6 | 34:40 Markelle Fultz | 10 | 1 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 17:54 Deandre Ayton | 18 | 6 | 10 | 1 | 1 | 8 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 36:29 Zion Williamson | 22 | 3 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 11 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 18:18 Anthony Edwards | 15 | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 12 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 25:09  Nothing too crazy. Simmons and Ayton both had great games. I feel like Zions was the most memorable though, 22 points in 18 minutes, 4/4 on threes, even though the Pelicans lost that was still a fun game. Oh and on that note: Edwards, Ayton, Towns, and Bennett all won their debut. Fultz, Simmons, Wiggins, Davis, Irving, and like I said Zion all lost their debut.  ^^^hopefully ^^^there ^^^aren't ^^^any ^^^mistakes ^^^in ^^^there"
If Anthony edwards said this about a teammate y’all would have fucking pissed yourselves laughing
"he's in his prime  how long he stays there is predicated on health  but given he's a big man with a history of health issues.........i doubt he stays in his prime long  and once he declines , it'll be like falling off a cliff   my guess is Lakers brass probably thinking about the future - maybe get Anthony Edwards and Lamelo Ball years down the road"
"I love the player Anthony Edwards is right now and he's on my fantasy team. However, until March, Ant was incredibly inefficient and the stats were only based on volume. He was dead last in all rookies in advanced metrics like VORP and Win Shares while rookies on ""bad"" teams like Tate and Haliburton were still in the rare positives of win shares. Quickley had good metrics and minutes on a good team. Ant's only argument until the end of the season when the Timberwolves finally turned a corner was stats based on volume. If it was an 82 game season, Ant may have won, but he looked to much like he was just putting up a bunch of stats on a bad team for most of the season."
"Yeah, it got particularly bad when the little verbal spat happened with Anthony Edwards. People think RJ sucks because he's not a walking highlight reel or a high volume guy. If you are only looking at highlights and game recaps he doesn't translate well."
"PPP is not necessarily better.   His frequency is more than 3x as much as Anthony Edwards.  That fact that he towers over the rest in frequency while being that high up in PPP is incredible   Also, does your list not fit the link or am I missing something? Was it updated after you posted?"

"Jimmy becomes a league top five 2-way player. In his final Bulls year, they sign Rondo. Rondo would outlet to Jimmy at least once a game.

Bulls go up 2-0 against Celtics, then Rondo injured.  Jimmy heads to Wolves = sp00ky. Western conference 2 seed before all star break. Jimmy opts out of all star game to rest. Jimmy gets injured and Wolves become fringe playoff team. 3rd stringers. Bounced in 1st round while Rondo helps lead NOP to sweep the Blazers.  Jimmy to 6ers. Ninja headband Bros. Kendall Jenner.

Let's not jinx anything  But speaking of Wolves, Anthony Edwards"
Anthony Edwards and Harden
Anthony Edwards has surprised me with his explosiveness.
"First the F word, not the S word in an interview? My newborn son just looked at me and said “Holy shit dad, lock the fuck in” and he said he learned it watching his favorite athlete, Anthony Edwards” we need to grow up already. This is destroying the youth of America already!!!"
Not sure who's better-- Giannis at basketball or Anthony Edwards at interviews.
I love him! I remember being skeptical of him from this:   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30321844/the-pain-promise-top-nba-draft-prospect-anthony-edwards  But I feel like once you know his personality he doesn't take himself so seriously like this article is making it seem.
Don't forget honorable mention Anthony Edwards for giving us back the ball at the end
“Anthony Edwards.”- Karl Anthony-Towns probably
Plot twist: The reporter was Anthony Edwards who finally mastered the Irish accent
he’s better than anthony edwards don’t @ me
Anthony Edwards would have complimented the man on his accent
Anthony edwards is no where near close to being a superstar
anthony edwards
"If you're Anthony Edwards, 10"
Anthony Edwards only mishandled that ball because it’s a Minnesota sports team
LMAO ANTHONY EDWARDS
Imagine Anthony Edwards on a different team.
No lol who the hell would really remember November 15 as the date it shifted “hey guys remember when Evan and Cade were rookies and how November 15 was the day ROTY convo pivoted towards Cade?” I mean do you remember the day when LaMelo’s claim was solidified? Or when Anthony Edwards joined the ROTY conversation?
He's putting up very similar stats to what Anthony Edwards put up in the first 13 games of his career.  Edwards: 12/3/2 on 36/27/74  Green: 14/3/3 on 35/27/80
"Yeah, didn’t you see how fast KAT got back on defense last night? You don’t just naturally have those instincts, you gotta go through an Anthony Edwards iso hundreds of times to learn them"
"He and Anthony Edwards are basically the first Gen Z NBA stars, right?"
"Lamelo , cole anthony, and Anthony Edwards bring so much fun to the game with their personalities"

"Isn't that the Kobe mentality - he had a quote on this. He was praised for this but it's not the best for winning basketball if a Deron Williams, Anthony Edwards is following it TBH."
Anthony Wiggins   I cant believe Wolved fans are turning on their best player since KG and want to build around Wiggins 2.0.   If I were the GM of the Wolves I would have traded Edwards a while ago while his stock is still high. Should have never taken him over Lamelo.
"&gt; 1: Anthony Edwards, Anthony Davis, Karl-Anthony Towns  It's all coming up Anthony"
"no, but you can look at other examples like anthony edwards de’aaron fox etc. they all started off in effecient, turning the ball over a lot etc and they have turned it around greatly."

Anthony Edwards and Draymond Green
Anthony Edwards
Will you let go of Anthony Edwards though? Lmao
"Just ask Ayton or Anthony Edwards. Rooks thrive with Ricky, especially big ones."
Anthony Edwards is going to singlehandedly turn this team around in 2 years time. Just give him time. He's the one.
"You throw a Hail Mary and move every piece you can to acquire Ben Simmons. It's the only move left that could push them to some form of contention again. Convince KAT that DLo is not a winning basketball player so that he approves of the trade.   From there you have through the 2023-24 season to prove to KAT that you can make it work. If it doesn't work, then KAT forces out that season and you blow it all up save for Anthony Edwards and just try building around him."
"So....I haven't watched the game, i just see Edwards with 22 shots to KAT's 11....are we sure that Anthony Edwards isnt just a worse Monta Ellis?"
[However there's also stories like this](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/anthony-edwards-stats-first-32-games)
"They get a DPOY calibre player in return, and just bank on Anthony Edwards"
"His listed hight hasn't changed iirc, but all the beat reporters have said he looks bigger from last year. The writer probably just googled ""how tall Anthony Edwards"". Or somthing like that."
Anthony edwards bandwagon fans? We'll fuckin take em!
"Over the years we’ve seen many, many takes on all-time discussions from NBA players  And my biggest takeaway from these is that players value 1-on-1 ability way more than anything.   That’s how guys like KD, Kobe, Kyrie get overrated IMO (relatively speaking ofc. Kobe is clearly top 15, KD is clearly top 20 while Kyrie isn’t top 100. rough numbers here).   And I think it’s even something that elevates MJ from being a GOAT level player to almost being worshipped  Best examples include MWP calling Kyrie a top 5 player ever and Anthony Edwards calling Durant the GOAT. There is clearly a certain skill these guys favor.   To be clear everyone is allowed to have their own criteria. But I think this is a clear explanation of why so many players have takes that are way off on our’s.   (I’d also add that fans fall into the same trap often)"
"At first I thought this was a comment from Anthony Edwards, I was laughing my ass off. I still laughed my ass off, but more sadistically."
Imagine if they got the #1 pick and got Anthony Edwards…
Honestly i'm still watching cause Anthony Edwards is on the other team.
Looks like Anthony Edwards is feeling the effects of last night in Hollywood
First game im gonna watch of Anthony Edwards. Judging from his stats this guy might be the MVP in a few years.
"Anthony Edwards is 20 too and just scored 48 against us. I hope I'm wrong, but Wiseman seems a little too raw for our timeline"
Jordan Poole for Anthony Edwards?… lol
"wiggins, then KAT 2 years later?  in another 2 years will they trade anthony edwards to GSW too?"
Anthony Edwards also entered the NBA during the most discombobulated preseason in recent history due to COVID. I feel like this was detrimental in his subpar start to his rookie season.
Anthony Edwards is better and in year 2. Jalen Green is more potential than results (like most rookies are early)

Anthony Edwards is stupid explosive.... I'd say he's in the conversation.  Just watched him drop 48 on the Warriors just casually getting by Wiggins Payton who are rediculous athletes themselves.  Iguodala was making business decisions literally wanted no part in making a full effort attempt at dealing w that dude.  Power + Speed I'm going with Ant-Man.
"lol, he's actually kind of not.  i guess tonight's games aren't factored in yet, but he's only 7th in 3PA.  1st and 2nd are steph and buddy hield and their 3P% are _ok_ (38.5% which is only bad because it's steph, and 39.1% for buddy) but everyone from 3rd to 7th in attempts is shooting from 23.4% (jordan clarkson) to 34.3% (anthony edwards).  i think duncan will still be above clarkson in 3P% after tonight since he was 2/10 in the pacers game.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=FG3A&amp;dir=-1"
"Nah its Anthony Edwards, you just saw that man drop 50 without looking like he was trying too hard"
Anthony Edwards is the most athletic
Feel like it worked out for the Wolves in the end. Getting D-Lo who got injured helped with the shit record that got them Anthony Edwards.
Anthony Edwards.  No actual way to prove this though
I really like Zach but Anthony Edwards exists
Anthony Edwards...more like Anthony Fraudwords amirite?  Jk the kid is a beast. Love watching him grow into a star
And that’s why we are in love with Anthony Edwards!
"&gt; He seals  Anthony ""Pinnip"" Edwards"
"This sub is completely stupid, now they're somehow trying to convince themselves Anthony Edwards is a better player than Towns. The funny thing is that they pick the lows for Towns and the highs for Edwards to estabilish this, despite the former having more highs than lows and the latter having more lows than highs."
I think the torch for Best Guy for a Quote in the NBA has been officially passed from Evan Turner to Anthony Edwards
ANthony edwards second year has been nothing but amazing. He's playing like a superstar. Only reason why I pay attention to the wolves is because of him. lol.
"And some terrible blown calls. Bjelica had a clean strip during a non-shooting motion and somehow Wolves got free throws out of it. Then Jordan Poole drove the lane and got clobbered in the head, easily a flagrant foul, maybe even a flagrant two. And he there was no blocking foul, no whistle at all, play on. I think they also scored off that “defensive stop.” Poole was complaining to the ref through the next possession and Kerr was pissed.  Those two calls absolutely killed our momentum and gave the Wolves every opportunity to stay in a game the Dubs otherwise had in hand.  Anthony Edwards is just insane, though. A second year guy that aggressive and athletic, he’s probably the type of player the Wolves were hoping Wiggins would be back in the day."
This. It's Minnesota. There's a good chance Anthony Edwards never plays with another guy as good as KAT...
PG: De'Aaron Fox  SG: Anthony Edwards  SF: Miles Bridges  PF: John Collins  C: Bam Adebayo
Even at that point it was only our 4th game and afterwards Anthony Edwards was talking like losing to us was a trap game 😭😭 When the Timberwolves view you as a trap game it’s a real problem #FireGriff
I think this one will be broken. Steph spent his first three seasons taking less than 5 3pt shots per game and making 2. Anthony Edwards in his second season is already taking nearly 10 per game and making 3.4 of them. And he's a mediocre shooter.  All it takes is one dude coming in ready to make these shots consistently and with the green light to shoot. He'll pass up Curry just by playing his whole career in a post-steph era where shooting like that is encouraged.
"I remember seeing a video posted a while ago that was Anthony Edwards hanging out with a bunch of other top recruits around his age and the interviewer asked who was the toughest guy he faced in high school, Ant said Cam Reddish and all the guys in the room agreed immediately. The guy’s got all the tools in the world to be great but I have no idea why he isn’t yet and why he wasn’t at Duke"
"I dig your other opinions, but Anthony Edwards already started off easily the most efficient high volume scorer from his draft class, and he should’ve gotten ROTY. I don’t think that’s wild.  But here’s my opinion: Edwards will be the premier scorer of the NBA within 5 years"
"&gt; Anthony Edwards will become the most efficient high-volume scorer out of any player of his 2020 Draft class.   This isn't controversial at all. I mean, who else would it be?  &gt;The contract Kristaps Porzingis is on right now is a lot better than what people make it out to be.  How so? Because it legitimately seems pretty shit  &gt;Andrew Wiggins will be a 20,000 point scorer at the end of his career.  Again, not controversial. He's only 26 has already cracked 10,000"
"yeah, exactly? so we count his stats from what he did play this year.  just like we count anthony edwards' stats from what he did play this year.  what we don't do is count stats from one part of the year and then try to revise the narrative"
I disagree. Like the knack on Anthony Edwards was that he preferred to play football than basketball. But clearly you can see he has the skill set to be an all-star. You don’t have to absolutely love the game to be great. Sometimes players are just blessed with physical talent and can put it all together
Top Headline of The Week: Is Anthony Edwards a sore loser for not enjoying losing by 60 every game?
"Starting 5: D'Angelo Russell / Anthony Edwards / Jerami Grant / Christian Wood / Karl-Anthony Towns. That's pretty clear-cut unless you're not sold on Edwards yet, then maybe you go Beasley/Ross/Harris?  Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...?  Man this list got ugly quick."
Whole world learned his name for that nasty dunk by anthony edwards. I really hope this can get the rounds so this guy can have his defensive talents showcased.
"&gt; I just checked your comment history, so much of it is you calling Anthony Edwards inefficient and showing his shooting stats. Hater.  What? Do you want me to say the sky is green and that he isn't shooting sub 40% on the season and mostly been bad? Once again, should I just not be allowed to watch TWolves games and have an opinion, your highness? Lemme know, commish.  &gt;Hater.  I would love to see you face adversity or criticism in real life. If bringing up the realities of his play makes me a ""hater"" and not thinking a player should be rewarded for being the worst defender in the league and being near the bottom of every impact metric that this sub worships; then sure, yeah, I am a huge ***hater.***"
"I didn’t say you couldn’t criticize him at all but I did say I understand why you criticized him so much. I just checked your comment history, so much of it is you calling Anthony Edwards inefficient and showing his shooting stats. Hater. And this is from a neutral fan idc about lamelo or Edwards,"
"Idk why Anthony Edwards, Lamelo Ball and Patrick Williams all being born in the same month is kinda interesting to me but it is"
"I love how the automatic go-to is ""you can't criticize Ant you're a Hornets fan!""  You wanna delve deeper on your own reasoning? Why would I give a fuck if this kid is good or not? A superficial award that has no bearing on my team's rookie or another rookie's careers? Or is there a chance that Anthony Edwards attended a large, regional college near my flair?   No chance I could have any connection to UGA. No shot I would want to follow the career of the best basketball recruit to ever attend the university. Simply no fucking way."
Unless you are Anthony Edwards.

"Wiseman was one of the top picks in the draft. He was teh worst center in the league. Anthony Edwards was one of the best college basketball players. He was arguably the worst player in the league. There are so few impact rookies it's insane, and the best NCAA team has maybe 1 of them."
"That’s not necessarily true. Guys that are drafted high need to have the build to develop into NBA players, they aren’t necessarily the best players in that moment against college competition. Like, Markus Howard and Bol Bol aren’t NBA bodies right now and their draft position reflects that, but they’d be more dominant against a team of NCAA players than Anthony Edwards and James Wiseman were before they came to the NBA, IMO. It’s just that wiseman and Edwards have higher ceilings than a guy like Markus Howard or skinny Bol"
"I think he will. He’s already made shocking progress since last years playoffs, and remember, this dude has played about the same number of games as Anthony Edwards since high school"
Anthony Edwards son
Anthony “4th quarter ” Edwards
"Anthony ""A1 since the All Star break"" Edwards"
"No, the team needs him to start eventually.  Small sample size, but when KAT, Dlo, and Anthony Edwards play together, they lead the league in offensive rating."
Don’t know if it’s the same one you are talking about but Kemba on Anthony Edwards happened a few days ago
"I don’t get it like what’s so hard for them to understand about this idea? Everything you said was facts.  They think you’re an Edwards hater like lol, for what reason would I hate Anthony Edwards? 😂"
Anthony Edwards is 4th lowest and has a decent shot at ROY

Anthony edwards commits a violation on every free throw. He steps over the line before the ball hits the hoop every single time. Why doesn’t anyone (ie the refs) notice?
"Top 10 rookies this season in no particular order: Edwards, Ball, Haliburton, Stewart, Tate, Patrick Williams, Saddiq Bey, Immanuel Quickley, Isaac Okoro, and Cole Anthony. I'd also potentially put Okeke, Campazzo, Wiseman, Bane, and Maledon above Flynn for their body of work so far.  Flynn's been great for a couple weeks, if he keeps it up until the end of the season maybe he cracks the All Rookie team ahead of someone like Quickley who doesn't have as much opportunity down the stretch."
Anthony Edwards is American tho.
Any one else see flashes of D Wade when Anthony Edwards splits 2 defenders on the perimeter and drives hard to the rack? I swear I’ve seen him do that a couple times already
"Is it? Anthony Edwards knows ARod was a baseball player, that's why he said ""But I don't know anything about baseball""."
This guy is hilarious. Add A-Rod to the list of people Anthony Edwards doesn’t know of along with the spice girls and the Jonas brothers.

Probably Anthony Edwards
Anthony Edwards for Deshaun Watson who says no
BREAKING: Anthony Edwards has been traded to the Minnesota Vikings.
"It'll be D'Angelo Russell , Anthony Edwards and whatever we can get in a trade for KAT"
I wouldn’t mind a Cade Cunningham / Anthony Edwards trio with KAT as the seasoned vet.
"I mean they have KAT, D'Lo and Anthony ""future NFL MVP"" Edwards  But yeah, after those 3 my mind kinda blanks out too"
"Has Edwards impressed though? 14 ppg on really poor shooting for a terrible team, not contributing anywhere else on the court, has the same bad habits as he did in college.  I'm not writing him off of course, but I'm certainly not ""impressed"" either compared to other #1 picks. Look at the early games of the past ten #1 picks -- obviously Edwards has been better than the early games of Anthony Bennett and Markelle Fultz, but that's it. Every other pick (including Wiggins) started off significantly better. Time will tell but as of now I don't feel like I'm watching a star in the making."
"Maybe below average, but still better than guys like D-Rose, Dame, Duncan Robinson, CP3, the Ball brothers, Anthony Edwards, Westbrook, Fultz, LeVert, Bagley, Barrett, D-Mitchell, Hield, and Oubre.  I think his efficiency will continue to rise. Some of this is due to a new system, which the team is settling into now. Plus, he does have consistent help in LaVine and things will only get better once Markkanen returns."
"Yep, it’s way too early to tell, Haliburton, LaMelo, and Wiseman are all front runners. But Anthony Edwards is averaging the most points out of all of them at the moment. Voters are pretty biased towards scoring when it comes to ROTY"
We were so close to a possibility of Andrew Wiggins and Anthony Edwards playing together. They could bond over not liking basketball and perhaps Edwards could teach Wiggins some (football) skills. Shame. Maybe in another life
Anthony Edwards
"You're right that usage rate doesn't include assists and that's why it makes sense that Jokic's is lower than expected. My argument is more so that its strange that he has been so incredibly efficient in all aspects of his game, including his scoring, and still has a usage rate lower than Drummond and similar to that of an Anthony Edwards. Keep in mind usage rate does include turnovers, and he's had quite a few of those, so I still think it's an interesting stat"
TIL Anthony Edwards acquired Cam Reddish
Edwards- dwyane wade/anthony masons  Wiseman- anthony randolph/marvin bagley  Lamelo ball- jason williams  Payton pritchard- muggsy bogues  Immanuel quickly- lou williams  Tyrese haliburton- george hill
If this is what y’all think after watching this dude have to play with D’Lo ballhogging ass I’m just gonna jump on the free Anthony Edwards train already.
"ESPN-Anthony Edwards considers himself a genius, other humans beneath him."
It absolutely does not. Anthony Edwards has that reputation because he’s said questionable stuff in his interviews. Literally no other black player has that reputation in the draft.   Debunked. Fuck outta here.
How is Anthony Edwards so far? Any buyer's remorse? James Wiseman has been a revelation.
"Think about all the storylines coming into the season.   Will Giannis be able to lead the Bucks one more and stay in Milwaukee if significant improvement isn't made?  Will James Harden stay in Houston after wanting a trade?   Will Lebron and co. repeat in the hard, hard West?  How will Lamelo do with Charlotte?  Anthony Edwards in Minnesota?  Kyrie and KD with the Nets?   Can Toronto come back in the East?  How about the Celtics?  Are the Warriors still to be feared?  Are the Clips a team that's for real?  And yet all these questions, *all of them* will pale in comparison to the Knicks now becoming a contender.   The flood of Starks, Ewing and Stoudamire jerseys flooding the streets. Hide your wives, hide your kids - things are about to change and they might get ugly."
"Yeah this title is dumb, but Anthony Edwards is hilarious"

Nah Cardi B should teach Anthony Edwards to rap if anything
"He's surrounded by people who have lost a parent (Ryan his dad,Rubio and Anthony Edwards lost their mothers) so the people around him who understand how he feels and it seems his GF has moved to Minnesota with him and has one of his good friends on the team so it should get better for him."
We don't know considering KAT and D'lo have literally only played **3 games together**.  The team looked competent with the two of them together on the floor and contention is largely based on Culver and Anthony Edwards progressing and being the supporting pieces to the 2 stars on the team. The other and more likely option that Rosas has been aggressively exploring is a trade for a third star so expect that maybe near the trade deadline.  But your claim that our culture is fucked is so wrong because since Rosas has came here he's been developing a family type culture and players have commented on it (He made a collage of all the articles about Malik Beasley and his play with the Timberwolves to convince him to sign the contract quickly or how he made a whole presentation for J.J Reddick) and even Paul Millsap considered a move to the Timberwolves but was reluctant to pull out his kids from their schools in Denver and re-signed with the Nuggets once they whiffed on Grant.
"KAT is hurt, our best defender (Okogie) is hurt, and our options at the 4 (Hernangomez and Layman) have been abysmal so far this season.  We are getting smoked in the paint and haven't looked competent on offense since KAT went down after starting 2-0.  Basically, we don't have a reliable 4 and we are left starting Naz Reid or Ed Davis at the 5 which is not ideal.  The team looks lost offensively with KAT being out and I attribute that to poor coaching. Saunders is the son of a franchise icon coach and people are starting to realize he wouldn't be in this position without nepotism.  Dlo has looked bad, but he is at his best in the PnR game, and Reid/Davis are obviously much, much worse at that than KAT.  Dlo had some success with Davis last game, Malik Beasley is a flamethrower, and Anthony Edwards looks extremely promising in the limited opportunities he is getting.  We can turn it around (hopefully) but KAT being out shows just how dependent our roster is on him to succeed."
But he's not Anthony Edwards good
(pre-injury) Jonathan Isaac   Tyrese Haliburton   Lamelo Ball   Ja Morant   Dame   Draymond   Coby White   Aleksej Pokuševski    Zion   Anthony Edwards   Jarrett Allen   Seth Curry
Anthony Edwards raps way better. Dame’s music is for old heads
Anthony Edwards
"Anthony Edwards: ""He's A1 From Day 1""..this a joke btw"
did Anthony Edwards just say he looked up to Donovan Mitchell?
"MVP: James Harden (assuming he stays and Rockets nab top seed)  DPOY: Deandre Ayton  MIP: Christian Wood OR Markelle Fultz   6MOY: Terrence Ross   ROY: Anthony Edwards  COTY: Rivers, maybe Monty tho"
Anthony Edwards already has Ant-Man and A1. Legend in the making.
"Honestly if the Raptors want to tank I could see Rubio,Anthony Edwards and something else for him. He'd bring the defence we want at the 4 alongside shooting and in return he wouldn't need to be the guy on the team but that's all if Raps want to move him."
A1 for Anthony Edwards will work out nicely if he keeps playing well.
ESPN is always useful to test. Especially when it comes to their Ball obsession:  Boban Marjanovic: About 2.490 results  Shai Gilgeous Alexander: About 3.040 results Alex Caruso: About 7.880 results Ja Morant: About 35.000 results   Lamelo Ball: About 80.900 results  Tyrese Haliburton: About 2.820 results Anthony Edwards: About 43.100 results James Wiseman: About 34.800 results Theo Maledon: About 422 results Killian Hayes: About 1.150 results
Calling Anthony edwards a bust after 5 games definitely makes you fake.
Anthony Edwards has been great wym
"Derrick Williams,  wes Johnson, Anthony edwards .  Jesus  At least KAT panned out"
"Shiiit. Between you and Anthony edwards being charismatic AF, I’m gonna have to start rooting for the wolves"
"I wanted to argue because Ayton or Holiday as the best 3rd option seems crazy but then I looked and it's probably true. I think I'd personally go with Holiday as the best 3rd option or Brown in Boston behind Tatum and Kemba or even Gallinari in Atlanta behind Young/Collins, with Klay injured there are very few teams with an all star caliber 3rd option. If Wall returns to 80% of his 2018 form, then him or Christian Wood could be the best 3rd option out there.   Other candidates are:   * Mike Conley/Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah) * Jusuf Nurkic/RoCo (Portland) * Josh Richardson (Dallas) * Tobias Harris (Philly) * Eric Bledsoe (New Orleans) * Anthony Edwards/Ricky Rubio (Minny) * Jonas Valanciunas (Memphis) * Myles Turner/Warren/Brogdan (Indiana) * Millsap/MPJ (Denver)"
I mean who doesn’t want to play with Anthony Edwards that kid is dope
I thought Anthony Edwards was the one that wanted to be in the NFL
"Anthony ""A1"" Edwards is being added to the official Reddit nicknames list."
Is this before or after Anthony Edwards has won his second superbowl?
Anthony A1 Edwards can't win without these KATs
Better not let Anthony Edwards hear you
I’ll take Anthony “brings his own food to Benihana” Edwards
"1. Brandon (I'm biased,) 2. Trae, 3. Wiseman, 4. Anthony Edwards, 5. Jaylen, 6. Simmons, 7. Lamelo.  Ant man probably should be above Wiseman, but idk I really like Wiseman. He'd be really interesting to build around too.  Haliburton/JA/Luka would change some of this up though..."
Oh no I said shit that a circle jerk disagrees wit? I MUST BE WRONG. Just like when a million Laker fans were demanding I apologized for saying the Heat wouldnt get swept in the finals.   I mean a common conception can’t be wrong right? Like when every pundit agreed Anthony Edwards was destined to be an inefficient player or when every pundit agreed that Steven Adams would ruin the Pelicans because of spacing. I mean people are never fucking wrong right.
anthony edwards??? jaylen brown is probably one of the best case scenarios for edwards
