DEVIN VASSELL
"well it depends. for example, using this past game, i think Pop killed us against the grizzlies., because he didn't sub out LMA when he was getting DESTROYED by Morant, not even putting his arms up to contest. knowing that, he could have subbed him out for Jakob. he also kept in trey Lyles early in the game to put rudy gay at the 3. rudy's been good but that's not awesome for either of them. when you're having problems defensively, going with Devin Vassell would have probably helped more than Trey was gonna help on the boards.  so I say all that to say coaches have a huge impact on the game, whether it's the timing of timeouts, subs and rotations, or actually bring a playcalling genius. even the GOAT has days where he's like ""you know, fuck it, I'm willing to lose this game to see how this lineup holds up"" and some days where he makes nothing but good decisions and it still doesn't matter because the other team gets hot. so basically, it matters, but players are still the ones on the court."
Buy on Devin Vassell
first: IQ Tyrese Hali Wiseman(ROY) Lamelo Pat Will  Second:  Devin Vassell Desmond Bane Tyrese Maxey Cole Anthony Xavier Tillman  Just missed: Payton Pritchard(would be in it if he wasn’t hurt) Precious Achiuwa Ant Edwards Saddiq Bey Isaiah Stewart Mason Jones
Counter point: Devin Vassell
Devin Vassell should be second team. Decent scorer on good efficiency. The best defender of the rookie class
Are the Spurs going to rue taking Devin Vassell over Halliburton at #11?
"I dont think they'd *need* to trade Johnson, but something like around Derrick White/Devin Vassell/Tre Jones. As long as they include enough picks they cover any trash. I mean the main selling point of Harden's deal was all the picks, the same could be here."
"Keldon Johnson and Devin Vassell are amazing. if not my team, I expected to hate reddish but honestly he's gonna be that dude in a few years."
"Devin Vassell, his impact on the court is crazy even if he isn't scoring, best defender of the draft for sure so far."
Really hope Devin vassell can develop in his mold a little bit. Slept on fun player to watch in the game right now.
These are bad. How has Anthony Edwards been better than Devin Vassell?       [Just look at this shit.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Esl0rlsVkAkcaPJ?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096)
"Devin Vassell is going to be REALLY good, I think they’re fine."
patty mills and devin vassell   the spurs are dominating this list lol. spots 2-5 are all spurs combos
Devin Vassell has been awesome to watch defensively. He looks like a monster and his instincts are on point. He’s shown flashes of being a capable 3 point shooter(which we need as shown tonight) but it’s his defence that stands out every game.  Pop almost never plays rookies this early and this many minutes unless they’ve impressed him
"They have 4 intriguing young players + White and Poeltl who look like solid role players.   Dejounte Murray - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Lonnie Walker - Secondary Ball Handler, Helper  Devin Vassell - Stationary Shooter, Wing Stopper  Keldon Johnson - Athletic Finisher, Helper  Jakob Poeltl - Roll + Cut Big, Anchor Big  Derrick White - Primary Ball Handler, Point of Attack  Murray, Vassell, Johnson, and Poeltl look like surefire starters. The question then becomes between Lonnie Walker or Derrick White as a starter and whether you want to use Walker off the bench as a bucket gettor like Tim Hardaway has been at times or Will Barton is for the Nuggets, or you want to use Derrick White off the bench to run your offense like Marcus Smart does for the Celtics.   Johnson is intriguing from the standpoint that he might be able to play some small-ball 5 in the future with how strong he is ala a PJ Tucker. Poeltl is really good for a center, but drop coverage becomes untenable in the playoffs, and you have to be able to switch 1-5. That's why it's not crazy that in the future they could close with Murray-White-Walker-Vassell-Johnson."
"Future looks promising for the Spurs with a solid youth core of KJ, Dejounte, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Devin Vassell and maybe even Samanic.   Even in the coaching department, Pop is setting them up well with Becky Hammon and Will Hardy."
"I just wanted to say that Devin Vassell is actually the player with the best defensive RAPTOR out of all the lottery picks, and really the entire class, at a +3.9."
"Devin Vassell is special. The stats won’t do him justice obviously, but take some time to watch this kid play. Haven’t had a rookie with this much potential since Kawhi. He’s already one of our best defenders, and offensively he’s more polished than Kawhi was as a rookie."
"how in the fuck is the Spurs future screwed up at all?  The Spurs are currently the 5th seed in the western conference with the easiest remaining schedule in the league while having been without their #2 option, have 7 players currently averaging double digits, and have $70+ million in cap space this offseason.  I'm not an idiot to think that the Raptors had the better offer. I'm on the same side as a HISTORICALLY GREAT FRONT OFFICE and completely trust their decision making. DeMar has been a fantastic player (contrary to what these bum ass casuals think about him), Jakob is a really fucking good defensive big, and Keldon is going to be a star.  they also just drafted Devin Vassell who was their highest draft pick since Tim Duncan and been their most NBA ready rookie since Kawhi Leonard.  also, Pop is the reason the Lakers only have LeBron and AD and not Kawhi as well, and the team they traded him to is currently sitting in the lottery.  but nah, keep trying to act like you know shit."
Devin Vassell = good at basketball.
"Devin Vassell is gonna end up being the best player from his draft class, do @ me."
*Devin Vassell has left the chat*
"I'm not disagreeing, but it's funny because Devin Vassell is also a poor man's Kawhi."
"May I introduce you to: Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, and Lonnie Walker."
"What's there to doubt? We've had 4 lottery picks since 1987:  David Robinson  Sean Elliott (2 x all star)  Tim Duncan   Devin Vassell  &amp;#x200B;  It's obviously still too early for Devin, but he's really passing the eye test. Then there was Kawhi right outside the lottery and I think that one speaks for itself."
"I think either Keldon Johnson or DeJounte Murray (so far).  Keldon seems like a for sure 10+ year player. His on-ball defense, his rebounding, his driving, his motor, it’s all already reeeally good. His 3pt flashes also seem like he can be a consistent 3pt threat too down the line. This is also essentially still his rookie year, as he only started playing in those 8 Bubble games the Spurs had. If he can learn how to create his own shot and draw more fouls, he will be a PROBLEM.  DeJounte Murray seems close but not over the hill of being a fringe All-Star. He’s good at drives, midrange shooting, on AND off ball defense, rebounding, and assisting. His problem is more his consistency. Some nights he’s brought it all and looks good, some nights he looks shook and awkward and lost. His motor and instincts need some work, and while he is a capable shooter and driver, it’s not reliable day in and day out. I believe he’ll get there soon, maybe even later this season.  Lonnie has major potential, but I’m not the most optimistic of Spurs fans about him. His speed and athleticism are amazing, and the tools to be an elite shooter and scorer in the paint ARE THERE, however, I’m feeling less confident it’ll all come to fruition. His BBIQ is low and his instincts are bad. So many times he second guesses himself, tries to do too much, and loses confidence in games. Pop always needs a ballhandler on the court with him because he (rightfully) doesn’t trust Lonnie to do things on his own. And while he’s still young and can improve on these, there doesn’t seem to have been any, so I’m not betting on it.  Devin Vassell looks great so far. He’s a prototypical long defensive wing with good instincts that can shoot from three. He reminds me a lot of Jerami Grant. He seems like a guarantee future starter in this league. Not much else to say about his ceiling yet since he hasn’t had that many minutes on the court, but almost all Spurs fans like him so far.  TLDR; Keldon or DeJounte."
Here are the players Lebron has primarily guarded this season:  DeMar DeRozan  Derrick Jones Jr.  Kyle Anderson  Keldon Johnson  Brandon Clarke  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Lonnie Walker IV  Rudy Gay  Eric Gordon  Devin Vassell  Coby White  Wendell Carter Jr.
This is almost certainly due to types of players LeBron guards and the types of shots they take: 48% of the shots against him have been 3PA.  Here are all the players who have taken 3+ shots against LeBron this year:  * DeMar DeRozan * Derrick Jones Jr. * Kyle Anderson * Keldon Johnson * Brandon Clarke * Tim Hardaway Jr. * Lonnie Walker IV * Rudy Gay * Eric Gordon * Devin Vassell * Coby White * Wendell Carter Jr.
"Really hyped on Devin Vassell and Haliburton as they were my guys throughout the long draft process. Isaac Okoro looks like he’ll be a contributor for a long time, and soon"
I would put Lamelo Ball and devin Vassell there instead of Wiseman and Pritchard
"Side note, how do you rank the younger guys on the Spurs in terms of future potential? Devin Vassell was my boy in the draft so I’m super hyped on him"
"Devin Vassell is sneakily really fucking solid, his defense is too good for a rookie.      The fact that Pop trusts him is very encouraging too, he just had great back to back games against both LA teams playing meaningful minutes, kid is gonna be great."
"When I saw him available at 10 I was 100% the Suns were about to draft but they selected Jalen Smith randomly. We, the Spurs, honestly needed a PF/C but also a SF wasn't that bad and also there the choice was between Devin and Tyrese so we went Vassell because he are loaded at PG/SG"
"He played zero minutes in game 2 against the Lakers (the exciting one where White made his return for a game), but then Vassell was back at it once White went down. He has an opportunity, more than ever. I'm excited about Vassell's opportunity. He looked good against the Clippers in the last one. I agree. Devin is legit. That shot of his is nice."
Dejounte Murray   Derrick white   Keldon Johnson   Devin Vassell  Lonnie Walker   Jakob Poetl   Derozan and Aldridge
"Mills has been great, but the run to start the 4th was Gay and Devin Vassell."
Is Devin Vassell the greatest shooter of all time?
Devin Vassell is already one of our best players take that for what you will
Devin Vassell I trusted you. And you hurt me like this how hopeful should I be about Atlanta senate going blue btw?
Devin fucking vassell he's gonna be good
"Lonnie Walker IV, Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, DeMar DeRozan (on expiring not sure if we’re bring him back next season), Luka Samanic (could take a risk on not protecting him not like he’s on teams’ radars), maybe mills?"
"Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker, DeMar DeRozan, Luka Samanic"
Fuck Devin Vassell
https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/nba-rumors-warriors-high-deni-avdija-devin-vassell-draft  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/nba-rumors-warriors-would-likely-draft-anthony-edwards-if-available  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2897309-warriors-rumors-gsw-high-on-tyrese-haliburton-ahead-of-2020-nba-draft  Just a quick google search
"I think Devin Vassell is gonna end up as one of the top rookies from this draft class, he’s looked solid so far and he’s on the best team in the league for player development."
It's probably going to have to require giving up at least 2 of the following:  Devin Vassell  Keldon Johnson   Derrick White  DeJounte Murray   This years pick. Whether it would require more draft capital would depend on which of these players   The fit is pristine though.
"We recently been without Keldon Johnson (recently came back last game), Derrick White, Rudy Gay and Devin Vassell. All were getting decent to big mins. Luka Samanic has stepped up and contribute as of late which is nice to see. Can't wait to get the whole squad back and healthy."
"I think Vassell will be a good NBA player and one of the most likely to reach his ceiling but I don't think his is as high as Luka or Lonnie.   Luka could be a game changer but he has a long way to go, recent success aside. Lonnie has off the charts athleticism and a smooth stroke but I worry about him not quite getting there (somewhere between a non-crazy JR Smith and Terrence Ross -- guys you glance at and think this guys is amazing, why isn't he a star?)  I would be happy to be wrong and see Devin become and allstar/all NBA performer but."
"Don't forget Devin Vassell!   He's still learning, but he gives you a very heady 3 and D player off the bench."
"That's fair, a half dozen is an exaggeration. But we do see players just as freakishly athletic come in every year. Anthony Edwards, Obi Toppin, Devin Vassell just to name a few rookies off the top of my head from just this year with other world athleticism.  Regardless though. I don't even know how this is somehow a knock on Dwight. He's a phenomenal athlete. So is just about every great NBA player. That's how pro sports are"
"We're missing Keldon Johnson, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell. We've been having to play Trey Lyles, Luka Samanic, and Keita Bates-Diop significant minutes and they normally don't play."
We drafted Obi over Deni Avdija and Devin Vassell. You drafted Marvin Bayley over Luka Doncic and Trae young. Nice try tho
"I just don't see how you could ever say he would *clearly* be the best player on the team when there's not much special about his game.   Especially when we have DeMar DeRozan that's still a walking bucket and should've been an All Star, Dejounte Murray whose still lockup on defense and finally a consistent offensive option, Keldon Johnson who is just an absolute monster, Derrick White, another extremely solid player on both ends and our best passer. Devin Vassell is a rookie and I think he has a bigger impact on both ends than Poetl.   Like yeah these advanced stats make him seem like he's top tier defensively but the eye test of watching him for the past 3 seasons doesn't really impress me."
You’d see Devin Vassell above Melo.
"The spurs have played 3 less games than the pelicans. No idea why people are acting like the spurs haven't played this whole month.   Keldon and Lonnie are both negative defenders right now. Derrick White has played 8 games all year and missed training camp because of injuries. I would say he's the spurs best perimeter defender. Dejounte has been better this year on defense than last year but still gambles too much imo, he's definitely a plus defender though. Patty Mills works hard to stay in front of guys but if his man gets the ball it's bad. Rudy Gay mostly plays 4 now and struggles to keep up with wings. Devin Vassell has been great for a rookie, definitely an above average defender already. The main reason our defense isn't bottom 10 is because of Jakob Poeltl, Devin, and Dejounte.  The pelicans do not have a bad roster at all, especially defensively. Eric Bledsoe was all defense last year and has been a good driving threat most of his career. Sure his defense probably didn't warrant that selection but he's a good defender. Lonzo Ball is a good spot up shooter and defender. Josh Hart is a great defender. Steven Adams is a reliable center. I'd say in terms of wing defense, the pels and spurs have been pretty similar.  Conley could definitely see a spot. He's been very impactful to the jazz and it shows in their lineup stats. His basic stats are basically worse across the board compared to DeMar's though so I think either of them deserve it over Zion."
Devin Vassell
My guess is they would only move him for an overpay that franchise loves him too much. I legitimately think like if Boston were to call they would be asking for Jaylen brown and obviously Boston would hang up. I don’t even know if like Devin Vassell Lonnie Walker and next years pick would get it done. So yeah I don’t expect a deal anytime soon
Any Spurs fans here and what do you feel about taking Devin Vassell one pick before Halliburton?  Who do y'all feel will be better in the long run?
"We drafted Devin Vassell at 11 this year. Rudy Gay was drafted 8th, Jakob Poeltl was drafted 9th and Trey Lyles was drafted 12th"
"Devin Vassell is playing great defense already. He has struggled against some of the stronger players but very rarely makes a mistake. He's already a much better defender than Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, and Patty Mills. Offensively he has hit his catch and shoot shots well and made the occasional athletic play. He has some moves to create shots of his own off the dribble but he's not great at it and isn't a good passer. He's doing pretty great I'd say. I imagine he'll get a much bigger offensive role in a few years and will improve his defense has gets stronger.  Tre Jones has been playing well in the G league and has barely played in the NBA. It's clear he knows how to play but if his shooting doesn't improve, I don't know how useful he will be."
"Right now? Batum is playing really good defense and hitting 45% of his threes. (Frankly, I cannot believe how much better he looks this year)  Middleton has always been one of those guys.   Royce O'Neale is one of those guys.   KCP  Justin Holiday.   Mikal Bridges  Slowmo Anderson.   Devin Vassell is going to be that guy.  There's plenty of guys who are both a significant plus on defense that can also hit threes at a pretty solid clip.   Gary Trent's defense is not on that level yet."
"Yes, Devin is really good, best defender from his class imo and serviceable offensively with good IQ and decent 3 point shooting. The only reason why he hasn't stolen all of Lonnie's minutes is because Pop doesn't want to kill Lonnie's confidence yet.        Also, Lonnie is a SG, not PG. He's not good but he has potential to become a very good player, it's just that all our other young guys have progressed faster than him and he's about to be left behind. And no, I wouldn't give up Vassell for Collins, I like JC but I'm just really high on Devin, he's already an elite defender with a decent 3 point shot and lots to build upon so there's no reason for us to move on from him."
Because they passed up Vassell and Tyrese as a complaint by some in this thread and elsewhere and took Smith instead. I said I see no issue with who Suns took and I am also glad they didn't take Devin. If I was a Kings fan I'd be stoked and say I am glad they passed up on Halliburton.
I really thought they were gonna steal Devin Vassell from us dude would be perfect for them off the bench wings would have fits having to deal with Mikal Bridges then see him checking in to clamp em up too.
"DJM is the biggest improvement this year - DJM was a genuine negative player last year but he's one of the Spurs best this year. Keldon Johnson as a starter has been a huge improvement on last year as well, as well as Devin Vassell being a positive piece off the bench instead of Forbes/Belinelli who were negative players.  Spurs have the best bench in the league right now imo."
"Yeah I you hit the nail on the head, their defence has been much better. They're up to 9th this season for DRTG after being 25th last season.      |||||+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|OnCourt|On-OffV| |1|Jakob Poeltl|26|564|+10.9|+21.1| |2|Rudy Gay|25|552|+9.7|+18.8| |3|Patty Mills|26|661|+7.9|+18.3| |4|Derrick White|7|162|+9.1|+11.2| |5|Devin Vassell|25|444|+4.9|+8.7| |6|Dejounte Murray|26|789|+1.2|+5.0| |7|DeMar DeRozan|24|800|-1.8|-3.1| |9|LaMarcus Aldridge|18|480|-8.2|-12.0| |10|Trey Lyles|14|165|-14.2|-15.5| |11|Keldon Johnson|26|781|-6.8|-16.0| |12|Lonnie Walker|24|647|-8.5|-16.0| |13|Drew Eubanks|10|132|-20.5|-22.2|    Based on these On-Off per 100 possession numbers it seems that the Spurs' success has also been driven more so from their deep bench and role players compared to their veteran starts."
"Im typing this at July 2021, here's what happens to the Spurs this year:  6th ring  We sweep the Kawhi on the 2nd round and we sweep the Lakers at WCF  Derozan is MVP  LaMarcus remembers how to play good again and turns into prime Duncan, becomes FMVP  Dejounte DPOY  Derrick, Keldon, Poetl all defensive 1st team  Lonnie MIP  Devin Vassell RTOY  Patty 6MOY and becomes the prime minister of Australia  Pop is revealed to be the actual basketball god himself"
"Essentially the same roster?!?! Bruh we started BRYNN FORBES almost every game last season, and Marco Belinelli got major min. We replaced them with Keldon BIG BODY Johnson and Devin 3&amp;D Vassell. This is a very different team. We’re fucking good defensively. Had and can get in stride on offense and be very tough to beat. Go spurs."
Tbh I’m just really high on Devin Vassell
"There are  a few rookies who are positive contributors this season according to RAPTOR: LaMelo, Haliburton, Quickley, Immanuel Stewart and Devin Vassell."
"First Team: Lamelo Ball, Tyrese Haliburton, Immanuel Quickley, Patrick Williams, James Wiseman   Second Team: Cole Anthony, Desmond Bane, Anthony Edwards, Devin Vassell, Jae'Sean Tate"
They just about blew out their mics when Devin Vassell made a baseline 15 footer with 9 minutes to go in the 4th. Wish someone had the vid.
"Mainly because Devin Vassell has looked great in limited minutes and fits the Spurs' perfectly. That's not to say that Haliburton wouldn't have been a better pick, but so far Vassell looks like he could be really good a few years from now."
Devin Vassell will be the next Scottie Pippen
"He hasn't gotten the playing time as some of the other rookies, but Devin Vassell has been solid. Xavier Tillman has also been ok, particularly on defense."
"I agree with you to an extent but I also think it depends. Like Point guards have the steepest learning curve but Center's still have to call out coverages and learn defense and stuff. I think the rankings of positional NBA transition difficulty go    1. Point guards and Primary creators (Killian Hayes, Leandro Bolmaro)   2. Centers and defensive bigs (Wiseman, Mobley, Isaiah Jackson)   3. Off the bounce scorers (Cam Thomas, Tyler Herro)   4. Plug n' play wings ( Devin Vassell, Moses Moody)"
"Tre Lyles, Drew Eubanks, Devin Vassell"
"&gt; As it is, you have an aging team who’s tried to compete for the last four years, and the best they could manage was the 7 seed  This is the youngest roster Pop has ever coached.  We've been rebuilding in place since our franchise player forced his way out, and are plenty happy with how we've drafted and developed players while actually trying to win games.  It's also misleading to ignore how much more difficult it is to advance up the board in the West.  &gt; We drafted an all-star, two very good players, and a number of role players and got to watch them grow.  A little reductive to called Luka Dončić an All Star, honestly.  But seriously, I really do enjoy watching Young play and think he's got clear comparisons to Steve Nash.  It's just bizarre to me that Hawks fans insist on pointing out that the guy they essentially drafted 3rd overall is better than the 29th pick we found at a culinary school.  It's not like Pels fans need to remind everyone that Zion is, in fact, better than Luka Samanić.  &gt; So I’d say Hawks fans are happy w/ the result of the last four years. Can you say the same thing about the Spurs? You enjoy losing those 7 seeds that much?  I can't speak for them, but I somehow doubt the average Hawks fan has enjoyed watching Hawks basketball the past four seasons, if they bother tuning in at all.  Kudos to those who do, but I don't blame anyone for choosing to skip watching a bad team play meaningless games.  As for us, it's great watching our guys develop together and gain real experience in the playoffs.  Watching the steady trajectory of genuinely likable blue-collar guys like Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson, Luka Samanić, Lonnie Walker IV, Drew Eubanks, and Devin Vassell is a treat.  While I don't think anyone on our current roster can be the centerpiece of a championship roster, they absolutely have the chops to compliment that kind of player."
"I feel like it's a win-win season. Make the playoffs and are over achieving. Lose and get a nice lottery pick. This last one got Spurs Devin Vassell, so I like their odds of pulling another from the lottery."
The Spurs might be about to do it again.  Dejounte Murray - 29th in 2016  Derrick White - 29th in 2017  Lonnie Walker - 18th in 2018  Luka Samanic - 19th in 2019  Keldon Johnson - 29th in 2019  Devin Vassell - 11th in 2020  All of which are really solid pieces. We're just lacking that franchise cornerstone at the moment so I hope one of these guys completely breaks out.
"He's not a bust yet, he's like 19 and needs time to develop.  But was a really dumb pick by Sheppard ... you're building around 2 high usage all star level guards in Beal and Westbrook... why are you drafting a project player who's strength is supposed to play making ... and his weakeness is shooting..  Devin Vassell was available ... and if you could trade down you could have considered Aaron Nesmith (although he's struggling) or Sadiq Bey .."
"The thing that Spurs fans need to recognize (along with the org) is that you don't do anything meaningful with role players. You need a lead dog. DeRozan will be 32 at the start of next season...he ain't it. We can't build around a declining player who isn't even a surefire allstar.   So then what? Jakob Poeltl is a one-way five who will be 26 at the start of next sesason. He is who he is.   Patty Mills will be 33 at the start of next season, and is honestly a 3rd/4th guard. He's also not under contract.  DeJounte, while a nice player, is a 1-guard who can't shoot. You're not winning a playoff series if he's the engine of your offense.   Derrick White can't stay healthy and will be 27 at the start of next year. He is who he is, and that's not a lead dog.   So now we're talking ourselves into Devin Vassell and his 5.3 PPG, or Lonnie Walker (one of the worst players in the NBA according to the advanced analytics), or Luka Samanic who has been pretty bad for two years now, or Keldon Johnson, who...maybe? He can't really defend or shoot, though.  I like plenty of those guys, but they're a supporting cast."
"They are making good progress. If they make the playoffs they are exceeding expectations. Otherwise, they get a lottery pick in a solid draft. They got Devin Vassell in this last one. They also have cap space so they can make key moves to pick up guys to help shore up weaknesses."
"between terrence mann, jonathan isaac, patrick williams, and devin vassell, FSU has had some great nba draft picks lately."
My defensive lineup:  PG: DJ Murray  SG: Derrick White  SF: Devin Vassell  PF: Tim Duncan  C: Jakob Pöltl
Devin Vassell is a straight up pro dude should be in the first sub group but just chills and stays ready to shoot 3s and play amazing team defense as a rookie.
no disrespect and i havent seen him that much but why was he picked over devin vassell?
"and I know everyone forgot about him  because he was supposed to be the low ceiling guy, but Devin Vassell is fucking awesome. he's legit a defensive savant and shuts down off ball actions and he seemingly never gambles and loses. he's shooting 40% on 3s and he's shown more dribble and pull-up potential than Danny Green ever did, who is most scouts' comp for him. fights for rebounds, gets putbacks, passes better than I expected.  a Spurs rookie hasn't gotten minutes like him since Kawhi, and I'd be happy seeing him get even more. I am honestly really high on him. this class is really good, you didn't even mention Pat Williams on the Bulls."
Devin Vassell this years pick and matching salary
"Devin Vassell on the Spurs. Dude has a great 3 point stroke with a high release and some on point defense. He's getting play on the Spurs this season, and Pop isn't exactly renown for giving rookies play time."
"All the Spurs young guys I feel like are this. Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell etc, I don’t know if they’ll reach their star potential, but I’m confident in saying these guys will have long careers in the league"
He's fine. A lot of their players haven't played for 2 weeks like White and Rudy Gay. Devin Vassell still isn't back from COVID protocols/conditioning.
"Throw in Devin Vassell and now we're talking. (FDU grad, obviously I'm biased)"
Hard to see the magic going for a package of salary filler Aldridge + a late first pick for their all star under contract for two more years.   That base plus Keldon Johnson + Lonnie walker or Devin vassell would probably need to be the start of conversations.
"So, i'm confused because to me, you guys did a beautiful rebuild. Devin Vassell looks to be a very promising player that has a lot of potential, same with Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, Murray looks pretty good (i'd even say he's gonna look very good next year) and Poeltl is finally starting to grow into what a lot of fans thought he could be. I wouldn't be surprised if most of these players become solid starter or even fringe allstar tier players given how they look at under 25. Maybe one of them will take the leap into all star tier. In 1-3 years or so depending on how FA works out, you guys are also primed to make the next package for a superstar.  You have probably the best FO to scout and help develop players given your record, the ""shot doctor"" in Chip Engelland to start these players off with a good shot, and the goat coach at the helm. Remember the 2014 Spurs?  Pop has taken a team with Demar as their best player, a couple of aging veterans from the glory days who have taken the bench role to ease the transition, the promising young players I named, and others, to a record thats better than teams with cores of:   Ingram+Zion+Lonzo, Fox+Hield+Barnes+Haliburton, SexLand+LNJ+Allen-KLove, LaVine+injuries, Raptors/Nurse magic, WB+Beal, Pacers-coaching staff.   IN ADDITION, they're within striking range of the Warriors and the Hornets.  Sure DeMar is probably better than some/most of those players, but I would argue he also has far less help. Like, you guys are doing *great*. As a Warriors fan, I think we have a pretty solid FO given our track record, but man I really wonder what Engelland could have done for Green's shot or something. I really wonder if the Spurs FO in our position would have picked Patrick Williams or something."
"Forr the UFA maybe go for some or one of          Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Harry Giles, Cody Zeller, James Johnson, Otto Porter Jr          For the RFA which imo they are unlikely to sign         Lauri Markkanen, John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Duncan Robinson         Everytime I've watched the Spurs this year im always thinking man they need some more Interior Defense, Rebounding, and scoring from the big. Another path I think they can take is getting a shooter that is around 6'6 where imo Devin Vassell or even Keldon can mold into the PF spot as the never really played a traditional big at PF, it was usually Rudy/Demar and sometimes Lyles/Keldon. Outside of Jakob's defense his offensive game is abysmal and his backups are weak both defensively and offensively."
Devin Vassell becomes a superstar and carries us for the next 15+ years like Timmy did with DJ and Keldon as his sidekicks
"My only deal is I’d be adding him to a team that already has Anthony Edwards, Caris LeVert, Andrew Wiggins, Chuma Okeke and Devin Vassell at wing 😅"
Think Buford and Pop are still thinking twice picking Devin Vassell over Tyrese Halliburton?
"Here are the Spurs 1st round picks in the past 5 years:  2016 - Dejounte Murray (29th)  2017 - Derrick White (29th)   2018 - Lonnie Walker (18th)   2019 - Luka Samanic (19th)  2019 - Keldon Johnson (29th)   2020 - Devin Vassell (11th)   All these guys listed above look like they can be legit rotation pieces at the minimum. Also, considering they’ve only had one pick in the lottery, they’ve drafted incredibly well relative to their position. I’d probably go Raptors, Spurs, Heat, Nuggets, &amp; Hornets in that order."
Wiseman's really missing out on G-League. He's a guy who can really use it. Sucks for young guys coming in right during COVID.   I know the Spurs likely would have sent Devin Vassell down to get more minutes if it was a regular season.
"Like I've been saying, if the Warriors traded down and drafted a Saddiq Bey or Devin Vassell or some guy who projected as a role player, and then signed a veteran center in free agency, they'd be a top 4 seed. Part of this is the schedule being easier but a lot of it is undeniable. One of those two losses was that close game to Boston, who knows how it goes if JTA doesn't have to leave, since he's a member of their closing lineup.  And as far as Curry's ability to ""carry a team"", none of the people he gets compared with ever had to deal with a high school center like Wiseman on their roster getting big minutes. Closest was LeBron in 2018-2019 with the young Laker guys like Ingram and Ball and he went 1 game over .500 in the games he played. Curry is now like 30-23 in the games he's played this season (although some of them are indeed without Wiseman). Not to mention he already proved the ""carry a team"" shit earlier in his career back when people weren't paying attention to the Warriors."
"You guys really whiffed that Deni Avdija pick. He’s an excellent ball handler &amp; passer, but that’s the opposite of what you guys need at the wing. A guy like Saddiq Bey or Devin Vassell would have made this team so much better."
People don't even know. Devin Vassell has an absolutely unguardable wet shot and the only reason he's not putting up a RotY level campaign is that he can't dribble. When he develops the ball handling (and maybe a little muscle) to make opportunities for himself he's gonna be legit.
"Devin Vassell is a beast. Efficient, good shooter, and good defense/defensive upside. He’s quietly been one of the best rookies this year and I’m convinced that he can be one of the best players in this draft class. He’s gonna be a part of the next great Spurs core."
I'm not mad that we lost. The Spurs are the Spurs. We should be OK.  I'm more mad that we really passed on Devin Vassell after I vouched for him so many times pre-draft. Please tell me Jalen Smith is gonna be worth it.
Devin Vassell: A better Danny Green who can actually dribble
"Someone would take drew Eubanks. He looked decent last year. Spurs would protect Murray; white, Keldon Johnson, walker, Poeltl, Samanic, Tre Jones, and Devin Vassell"
Hopefully Devin Vassell
"Bro, I picked Devin Vassell as my guy. Like, I am invested in his success now"
Devin Vassell still my boy
Do you think Devin Vassell can become like Tgybulle?
Spurs fans: Do you guys still believe Devin Vassell will as good or have a better career than Tyrese Halliburton?
"Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, Jakob Poeltl, Lonnie Walker, Luka Samanic, Tre Jones. I feel like Eubanks would certainly be taken from us. He is a decent backup 5 on a minimum for two more years."
"It’s not about the scoreboard, it’s about how they looked in that loss. They had zero answer for Anthony Davis, inside or outside.  It’s pretty different than Keldon Johnson, Drew Eubanks, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Rudy Gay, and Devin Vassell all going off at the same ."
A better version of this list  1 Timberwolves select Anthony Edwards  2 Warriors select Lamelo Ball  3 Hornets select Tyrese Haliburton  4 Bulls select Patrick Williams  5 Cavs select Isaac Okoro  6 Hawks select Killian Hayes  7 Pistons select Devin Vassell  8 Knicks select James Wiseman  9 Wizards select Onyeka Okongwu (honestly Wiseman and Okongwu could go either way)  10 Suns select Deni Avdija  11 Spurs select Aaron Nesmith  12 Kings select Kira Lewis Jr  13 Pelicans select Obi Toppin  14 Celtics select Jalen Smith
Don't sleep on Devin Vassell either
"If we’re doing current NBA players, Hawks would look something like:  - PG: Malcolm Brogdon/Sexton/Lou Will (if you count Sexton as a PG) - SG: Jaylen Brown/Anthony Edwards/Malik Beasley - SF: Devin Vassell/Okoro/Okeke - PF: Jae Crowder/Derrick Favors/Aminu? (We’re lacking at PF) - C: Wendell Carter Jr/Dwight Howard  I can’t think of a third center but honestly not bad at all.  Edit: I’m leaving r/Dwight in there, formatting be damned"
"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
"this is not true. first of all derrick and dejounte can share the floor, they really complement each other in the best way possible, really, what one do not do, the other do it well. off the bench the bench we have lonnie walker who yes has defensive issues but he played alongside demar and often as a wing which he absolutely is not so he wasn't in a really good situation to defend, plus in general he's not that great. patty mills might leave and go to a contender while he fully go youth movement, win-win situation for both us and him. so we would have tre jones in development who showed really positive flashes, and we could sign a pg just in case too. we do not have five point guards, we are in a right situation in terms of guards, just no need to add more espeically considering how weak our frontcourt is.  i'll also add some other things from a post i did like more than a month ago about our situation, you can read it all if you want [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  Let's begin by stating the versatily of the players. DJ is a pure PG, same goes with Tre. Derrick White is gonna start at SG, but he would have zero issues to play the PG  alongside Lonnie who on the other hand could slide at 1 for a small amount of time, but he is definitely a Pure 2 and not a 3 AT ALL, this season showed us this. Keldon is a full-time 3 but he can easily slide at 4 in a small-ball situation. About Devin I would say that he definitely need to play the 3 as his preferred position, he has all the tools to do so, and a solid summer in the gym would define it; he can slide at 2 regardless. DJ-DW Backcourt is really deadly. DJ proved this season that he is arguable the best player on the court without DeMar. And guess who is the other dude that is arguable the best player after DeMar? Derrick White. So yeah, a starting backcourt of this two is obvious and worked amazing when they were both fully healthy. I would play DJ and DW around 30+mins, maybe Derrick a couple of minutes more since he's more versatile. Off the bench Lonnie should definitely be our go-to-guy, our 6-Man. uly him more around 20-25m, limayeb slide him at 1 if necessary. Tre ones is also a really good fit with him, he needs a true PG like him that repares the play for him, they complement each other. The point is that Tre is not that ready, but he has to play, for sure, I would play him around 10-15m, but he can easily see his minutes go up if he keeps doing well! Devin at 3, maybe at 2 if needed, would be really good, a 3&amp;D guy like him is really amazing, I would play around just below 20mins. On defense our true liability is Lonnie, but he would find Tre and Devin, both elite defender, on the perimeter helping him so he can focus on his man and Lonnie showed he can be even above average if he focus on 1v1, imagine with an offseason of work.  also a ""small"" review on their season:  DEJOUNTE MURRAY  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  DERRICK WHITE  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  LONNIE WALKER IV  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him? I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  DEVIN VASSELL  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season"
"You're asking the wrong guy.   I'm on the tank train.   We have actually only had 1 lottery dude since Tim and that's Devin Vassell. He didn't play much this season.  We have Great development, but at some point you need genuine top-tier talent.   Our team refuses to tank, our team refuses to trade to move up in the draft, they're just trying to make the playoffs I guess."
I followed Haliburton and know more about him than Fox because I wanted GSW to draft him. Same as Devin Vassell. I really like his approach to the game.
Devin Vassell
"I would just say they're doing OK. I'm probably more pessimistic than some other fans but Derrick and Lonnie may just be who they are. More so Derrick at 27yo but  after this year I think we'll know a bit more about both of their longer term projections. I've personally been putting more stock into Dejounte (obviously), Keldon Johnson, &amp; our rookie Devin Vassell."
Devin Vassell looks like he’s going to be the next Khris Middleton of the league. I’m biased obviously but his game is so nice and smooth on offense and his defensive IQ is off the charts as well. I definitely think he’s taking a big step this year
"It’s very premature. But as a Spurs fan who watched at least 75 percent of the games this season, Vassell has something about him that seems tamed, but ready to envelope him at a moments notice. We see it when he gets out on the break and does something extremely athletic, or when he surprises you with a pull up jumper. You start to realize this guy has more than just a knack for defense. Then you start to get mild Kawhi vibes. Doubtful he’ll become as great a 2 way player, but I believe in Devin."
"glad to see some positive takes on the comment section here!  i'll answer op tho. no, we definitely not. i gotta say that we really went undercover this season, i really doubt ppl saw spurs games outside of when their favourite team played us, maybe even not. we are currently seen as a trash team, it's easy to see everyone calling us out to ""click the rebuilding button"" but the situation here is way different from the common understading of us. i even made a extremely long [**post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if you wanna give it a try! ^(i don't wanna  pass for a spammer lmoa, but that's my complete point of view, just if you want) . Anyway, what ppl mainly do not realize IMO is our core. It seems crazy to me how much even spurs fans undervalue the potential of our young guns, and also that we have ton of them. My main counterpoint is this: OP falls into the same trap kinda everyone fall into: not give them enough time. (it's not a dissing, chill out, sorry if i ever offend you in any way, not my intention) There have ton of bad coincidences in our development route and if you don't follow the Spurs with attention it's easy to miss them. We don't do the same things other teams do, rookies do not get playing time, vets eat young players' playing time. I'll go player by player: Keldon Johnson just finished his sophomore season, but in his rookie year he only played in the bubble for us, he did'nt even played three digits games in the NBA! And he was played out of his position too, guarding crazy opponets like Zion, AD, LBJ, literally always the best forward on the opposing team. DJ spent his rookie season in the G-League, then got a solid amount of minutes in the second season, he torn his ACL in preaseaon headed to his 3rd season, he came back after this devastating injury and already Spurs fans wanted to give up on him because he did not perform that well, and last season he was clearly our briightest young player. Oh, he was in the 2nd Defensive Team according to bball-index. Derrick White again spent his rookie season in the G-League, then got solid minutes because of DJ's injury, in the third season then played ok, but in the Bubble showed a crazy improvement (check out his stats there) and was clearly our best player, even arguably better than DeMar; this season tho he injured his foot twice, his toe twice, got COVID, injured his ankle, could stay healthy; he did need time to get back to his bubble form and when he did man he was amazing, just again clearly our best player. Assuming he stays healthy, dude is a baller, cannot wait till he get recognized. Devin Vassell, our rookie, our 4th lottery pick ever, seems like everyoen forgot about him, which is crazy. Dude is arugably one of the best defender in the team and even his rookie class, jsut amazing. He got COVID and then he couldn't buy a shot. Also, he didn't get those many minutes, again, for the reason I explained before, we tend to overplay the vets. Definitely a bright future. Lonnie Walker is a polarizing player in the sub, but probalby got asked to do too much, but he absolutely he didn't play that well, but now let's not act like he was complete garbage. Obviously he needs to work a lot this offseason, especially on defense and BBIQ plays, but he really stepped up in terms of offense, he polished his jumpshot and his ability to finish at the rim. He came to the league as a raw talent, spent his first year in Austin, second one barely got minutes because of Forbes, Belinelli, COVID. Last season he finally got minutes and he did ok, maybe not as much as everyone expected, himself included. Next season I gonna be really important for Lonnie! I think that he could be able to have good defensive player with him on the court that can help him and cover his weaknesses. Also, he will come off the bench and won't start. So playing against weaker opponents, being probably the go-to-guy oon offense off the bench, without DeRozan who is not a good defender and instead have Tre and Devin, extremely valid defender, will help him. If he still struggle a lot, decisions have to be taken, definitely. I'm still a huge believer. Then Jakob Poeltl stepped up this season and has been a really good player for us, an underrated defender, i think the best one in terms of contesting the shots under the rim in the whole league, he got into the 3rd defensive team for bbal-index too! Consider also dudes like Tre Jones and Luka Samanic who have a solid chance to be good role players for us too.  I also gotta admit the we didn't rightly used our resources yeah. DeMar clearly do not fit us and we should have traded him before and the deadline was our last chance, unless we pull an extension-and-trade, we will lose him for nothing, we could have gotten at least a Pick around 20s. Also we misplayed many players that damaged our young guys fit in the team. for example by playing bad defenders like forbes and demar, dj had had a tough time that season, and this was mad clear, white should have played alongside dj like we do now. in the bubble jakob showed how aldridge wasn't good for us anymore and we should have traded him immediately, we did not and lost him for nothing. also this season, lonnie and demar were bad defensibily, it was clear also that keldon was playing outside of his natural position. i do not wanna sound like an homer lmao, even thoon my inside i know i am at least a little bit, but this is my point of view.  TLDR: so yeah, it comes down to ajust these things and finally move on and leave the keys to the young guys even if it means lose more. i think tho he ready to at least compete for the 8th seed, these guys are really mad hungry and have the right mentality to get to the next level one day, we just need to give them time and the right playing time! cannot wait for next season! also, we have ton of cap space. oh, i urge you again to watch my full post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)"
"Devin Vassell can be a franchise player and is that special prospect, bet on it."
"Trade away Demar not Dejounte. Keep the young coreof Dejounte, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell and Luka Samanic.  Then have Chip Engelland work with Ben on that shot."
I’m glad we were both on the Devin Vassell hype train.
&gt;devin vassell    based clipper fan
"It’s low key kinda fun. Not even kidding, I’m attached to dudes for their careers at this point because I chose them as “my boy” in the nba draft that year.   Still think Devin Vassell is a future mvp"
Spurs entire team is basically late first rounders/2nd rounds steals. Devin Vassell was their first lottery selection since Tim Duncan. The team that embodies the culture of winning and not losing purposefully. They deserve it.
Thoughts on Devin Vassell? He looks somewhat promising
"&gt;Spurs...would have to include a Derozan SnT  I don't think so, I think the Spurs could put together a package centered in their young guys that would be pretty compelling. Dejounte Murray does a lot of what Simmons does (obviously not as well but still pretty well), but is a lot cheaper and has some semblance of a half court offense for example, then there's wings like Keldon Johnson, Lonnie Walker, or Devin Vassell who would all fit with Embiid really well. Plus the Spurs have the cap space to make salary matching pretty easy.  The only question is if the Spurs are willing to make the trade, they're obviously historically very stingy."
"There's some very good pieces on the Spurs, I'd get excited for Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, or Derrick White. Even a Demar sign/trade could be intriguing."
"Idk I’ve never really payed a lot of attention to docs teams but Pop is basically the same, most of our picks even the high ones rarely play their first year. Devin Vassell got more minutes than I can remember any other rookie getting recently  Edit: talking more recently like end of the big 3 era"
"I don't think so. Prior to the all-star break and covid destroying our season we were as high as 4th in the West and had a top 10 defense. On top of that Dallas is a mess right now, Houston is bad for the next 2 to 3 years, and OKC has potential but no guarantees.  Going forward:  Dejounte at 24 is an all-defense level guard who can give you 15/8/6. Keldon Johnson is 21 and going to average 15/10 next year. Jak is 25 and is a top 5 defensive center at the worst. Derrick White is 27 and is a very good two-way guard who gives you 15/5/5.  We also have a 22 year old Lonnie Walker 6th man, a 21 year old Devin Vassell who is already a good 3&amp;D wing, and a 21 year old Luka Samanic.  That by itself is a good foundation of youth that has one or two all-star level talents (DJ and Keldon) and 3 or 4 very good role players. We also have 50 million in cap space (assuming Derozan and Gay walk), the GOAT coach, and a lottery pick in a deep draft.  If even one top 25 player came in a trade or FA we'd be looking at a guaranteed playoff seed (above the play-in cut off)."
"Defenses don't really respect any Spurs 3 point shooting. It's how they stop all the slashing from DeMar, Keldon, Murray. Spurs 3 point shooting to end the season went really rough. Look at Party Mills and Devin Vassell splits if you want to see scary.   The DeMar example is far off from what you see with Simmons. DeMar takes a lot of those shots but he has a bad habit of also touching the line too (make or miss). He still shoots his shots relatively confident."
Poku had multiple games with over 20 points. Vassell didn’t reach that mark once. Poku at his best is so much better than Devin at his best. Not particularly close imo.
Somebody close to the Spurs who still believe Devin Vassell is the real deal.
Played AAU/high school ball with Devin Vassell and Anthony Edwards. Met Chris Paul when i was 10. Teammates with Josh Okogie in high school. Played against Marvin Bagley in the 8th grade and plenty of other future NBA players.  Here I am Chegging my way to a bachelors degree
"Some paragraphs I wrote about as season recap. I hope they are helpful.  * **DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Here HE is. What an amazing dude DJ is man. From being passed up in the Draft because of his background and tearing his ACL in his third year to be the true leader of the youngins in his 4th season. I'm might be a homer about DJ lmao, but I really think he's that dude, the one that ok may not be your go-to-guy on offense, but definitely the one you always want in your team, pushing everyone to their best. He made major improvement, he can finish at the rim with ease, his mid-range is so beautiful and kinda already almost automatic, his defense got back to the level when know and we gotta consider that he still had to play with DeMar and also, for the vast majority of the season, with Lonnie, both not great perimeter defender, with possibly DW and Keldon it would go even better than he already is. He's mentally at the next level, so I can see him develop more and more, sky's the limit. What I would focus on this offseason is trying to optimize the three pointer with more confidence and maybe some other small stuff like building up more muscles and bring playmaking to another level, handles too. Gotta love DJ tho!  * **DERRICK WHITE**  Sadly Derrick missed ton of games this season, he just could stay healthy. First he injured his foot in the Bubble, he came back at the beginning of 2021, he immediately injured his toe, before coming back he re-injured it, he came back, few games and he got COVID, he came back, played well for few games and again injured himself, this time his ankle. Man, it was tough to see our boy down. It showed that we really need him, he's so essential for our team. He's the most complete player in the team, he really can do it all. Next to DJ he's just perfect, they complement each other so well. I just hope DW, I mean everyone, stays healthy so we can watch him play all season long with DJ!  * **KELDON JOHNSON**  **BIG BODY.**  Man, I love this dude lmao. He has played so well this season and didn't even play triple digits games in the NBA, he gained all Pop's trust so quickly, it's crazy to me, it's hella difficult to do so! Our roster honestly wasn't prepared for such a breakout player like Keldon so we had to adapt and we played him at the 4, defintely not his ideal position. He had to guard the opponent's best player kinda each night, he's that versatile on defense, from Zion to JJJ to Doncic, and somehow he manages to do nice enough. The point is that yeah he coudl slide sometimes, but he's a 3 and like this he would play much better in every single way. His main strenght on offense is driving to the basket so having a smaller and thinner player on him would help him a lot than having AD or Zion, defintely. On defense too, I still remember that ""viral"" clip of him locking Doncic up in the last game before COVID in 2020, against smaller opponents he manages to stay with his man both in the arc and inside. Another aspect to not forget it's rebounding, at SF he would actually be able to help even more and box out smaller players. In terms of working out I would defintely work on the shooting, especially the three pointer, he made 1 a game, I would like to see him hitting at least 2 a game next season. He already showed improvement with the season going on, especially from the mid-range with him acutally creating his own shot, it was beautiful to watch. The way he developed since entering the NBA is crazy to many, I really do not know what to expect from this dude, he's has been amazing!  * **JAKOB POELTL**  Jak started teh season really poorly. With LMA still being around, he just could find the right fit, but once LMA went away, he finally stepped up BIG. After that awful FT slump, he somehow fixed it and went crazy, really couldn't miss anymore lmao, but he still needs to be consistent and especially confident with his shooting mechanics from the FT. His defense is statistically one of the best among big men in the entire league, dude is realyl good at it. On offense he does the small things well. Now tho he knows his role and what he needs to do, he just needs to master these things, not add much more. For example, his main problem is aggressiviness, man he needs to freaking dunk that ball, acutally get up and put it back in with ferocity, here he should imitate Drew effort! On defense kinda the same, sometimes he randomly get lazy and the opponent scores on him with ease. Also, on offense I would work more and those small hook/floaters from near the rim, mastering them would be amazing! I think that now that he knows his role Jak can have a solid offseason of work!  * **LONNIE WALKER IV**  My boy Lonnie, prolly one of the most controversial, according to this sub, player in this roster. Let's start with this season. All the times Derrick was out he started. He did not played amazing, but let's analyze. He was the last guy considered on offense, but let's be honest, it's all his fault. He's too passive, he needs to be more aggressive an take resposabilites and ask for the ball more, definitely. On defense? He was below average, but he wasn't that bad as advanced stats tell. I mean, he defintely lacks some fundamentals especially as team defense, but at least you can see he tries and on 1v1 he's acutally nice and sometimes he even makes nice defensive plays, but defense it's definitely his main weakness (along with passiviness I would say). Anyway, I personally love Lonnie both as a player and a person. He seems to be such a genuine guy, emotional one, care about everything, players and himself, hard-worker, we wanna prove he has value and that he can hide his weaknesses by working out on them. He (at least for me) has shown he truly has ton of potential but still needs A LOT work, that's a fact. He did an amazing offseason of work last summer, He's polished his finishing and his jumpshot became pure, while also building up muscles. I expect him to work on other things this summer, maybe keep working with Jrue Holiday might help him in terms of defense and positioning, Jrue excels at these things, Lonnie doesn't. TO defend Lonnie from criticism I would also add that he's 22yrs player in his 3rd season in the league, he spent his first season in the G-League, the second one half on the bench because of Marco-Bryn, half for just 10mins, i his 3rd one he finally got solid minutes and averaged 11ppg in 25mins. Does Lonnie need to work like hell this summer in things that are related with defense? ABSOLUTELY, he needs to do so. He also has to work on much more other stuff, like know where to be, be less passive, work on hands and dribbling, do not take bad shots just because he feels hot.. he definetely need to workout. Now, he has a really solid work ethic, just look at his shot and finishing, he improved a lot, really. Also, his muscles, him being spending a whole summer with Jrue Holiday, a proven baller and a defensive master who could teach him stuff this summer. He will improve. But do not get me wrong, he really showed flashes of the POTENTIAL of being an amazing player. Will he become James Harden? Oh, hell no. Has Lonnie the potential to become an All-Star or at least a fring one? Definitely. Does this mean he will absolutely will? NO. What if instead we get a Jordan Clarkson type of guy? Y'all would really give up on him?  I mean, do whatever you want, y'all are rightly free to think whatever you want, but I'm just saying, I saw these type of criticism, maybe even worse one, against a Spur last season, his name is Dejounte, you know the end of the story.  * **DEVIN VASSELL**  Our rookie! Under various circumstances, Devin was able to get minutes from Pop by Day One. Also, what he brings to the table is so imporant and key in today's NBA that he could sit tbh. He's a 3&amp;D guy and he already showed really interesting flashes like that driven and small step back from like the free throw line, I love that, it shows he can develop his own shot creation too! Yeah, he still needs ton of work but for a rookie it was fine. He needs to work on not missing open looks and be more focused in order to drain them easy looks and most important thing he needs to spend most of his time this offseason in the gym. Boy is too skinny to play the 3, position I think suits him better since he's tall enough and at 2 it's not that flashy to play it, so he needs to put up muscles to play it, I think this is why he still played most of his minutes at the 2 this season. Most of our youngins that came in the Spurs environment grew in terms of muscles so I think it won't be that difficult for Devin to do so if he follows our development staff. Let's see how he behaves next season  * **DREW EUBANKS**  Drew started to play solid minutes once LMA was gone and when he was hurt. He was not amazing, yeah, but I gotta be honest that he always brings that energy that is needed. He plays good and does the things he need to to at an average level, really good for a minimun guy. I love Drew and he's such a cool dude to have around the guys here!"

"Yeah I mean the nature of these threads is despite what we will say the odds of any of these guys becoming actual stars nonetheless superstars are quite low. So your just looking for what possible path is there to reaching such a level and is it completely implausible. I would say probably so for being like a top 12ish player for DeJounte Murray but if I had to nominate someone for this he's a better candidate than a number of names Ive seen here like Cam Reddish or whatever. And by ""better"" candidate its like a 3% chance vs 1% or whatever.   Someone else nominated Devin Vassell on here which if you made San Antonio pick which guy would you keep the next 5-10 yrs Vassell or DeJounte that's an interesting question. I bet they might say Vassell"
"Pretty comical to see guys like Darius Garland, Markelle Fultz, Devin Vassell and Okeke with more upvotes than Tyrese. I guess as a Kings fan I’ve seen so much of him and know how much better he is than those guys that it didn’t occur to me the league really doesn’t know how good he will be yet."
Devin Vassell  I dont give a damn. I believe in that kid.
"* I could see Malik Beasley hit 25ppg with everyone on the Wolves healthy.  * Derrick White could have had a breakout season last year but couldn't get healthy.   * Jalen Brunson is really good, but maybe we won't see him flourish until he leaves the Mavs.  * Maybe not MIP, but TJ Warren will have another excellent and totally ignored season. 20ppg on 60 TS%.  * Nickeil Alexander Walker will have some massive games, but struggle with consistency.  * If we are allowed sophmores, I think Haliburton and Patrick Williams will have big leaps. Maybe Aaron Nesmith and Devin Vassell."
"I would be very suprised tbh, Lonnie got a lot of burn last year and he kinda sucks. He would have to take a quantum leap to be better than any of Dejounte, Derrick and Keldon.  I think Derrick White is the guy to look out for as a breakout on the Spurs, and maaybe Devin Vassell."
Kelly Olynyk IF they start him Kevin Porter and KJ Martin Oshae Brissett Jaden McDaniels Nic Claxton Tyrese Haliburton and Chimezu Metu Devin Vassell  Nickeil Walker Alexander Robert Williams
"Couple things I’d love to address here.   1) the rumors are that Halliburton was telling teams not to pick him so he could go to Sacramento  2) Killian Hayes, Deni Avdija, *Jalen Smith*, and Devin Vassell were also picked in front of him, I’m not sure why obi and the Knicks are being singled out"
"Spurs need to believe one of their young players, whether it’s Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, needs to become better than their current role or else they’re gonna be a pretty bad team next season. My bet is certainly on Keldon Johnson"
Devin Vassell. I’m hoping he pulls a Summer League sophomore Kawhi and gets pulled from the roster for being too good. He was far and away the best looking player in our first SL game. Excited to see if he can add a wrinkle or two to his offensive game. His defense is crazy already.
"""San Antonio is sending Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, and the 2022+2024 1st round picks to Philadelphia for Ben Simmons"""
"Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, Doug McDermott, Keldon Johnson, Jakob Poeltl.   Derrick White, Josh Primo, Lonnie Walker, Thad Young, Zach Collins.  Tre Jones, Da'Quan Jeffries, Keita Bates-Diop, Luka Samanic, Jock Landale"
"11-19 range. The typical player picked in that range is a role player. We’ve picked Lonnie Walker, Devin Vassell, Luka Samanic, and now Josh Primo. We have no idea what the latter four will be. Lonnie is a pretty typical player for someone drafted 18."
Devin Vassell is the only lottery pick we had since Duncan and he already has a really well rounded game for a rookie. Primo is 18 and pretty raw as a prospect so it’s unlikely for him to see any playing time other than garbage time
"He was a bench shooter in Indy, 13.5 pts on career 40% from 3 wouldn't be a bad look for a Spurs team who's best shooter from last season that's definitely back was probably who? Devin Vassell? Lonnie Walker?"
"I think so. It’s a different take on rebuilding. No implosion, just developing and maximizing the talent we have. We did what we could with Lonnie Walker, and I think this coming season is his last season to show he can at least be a strong role player. Last season he showed flashes, but is bad defensively. He has all the physical tools, but so did JR Smith. Murray and White proved to be good players. White looked ready to burst out but injuries set him back. Murray is on a team friendly deal, and there’s a big chance he has his breakout season next season. Right now, I think the focus shifts to seeing what Keldon Johnson can be, then Devin Vassell who showed so much promise. I actually believe we have accepted that we could be a bottom 5 team next season, and have a real chance to draft Holmgren, Banchero, Jovic or Hardy."
"sure. but he leaned about as heavily into his killian hayes take as i've ever seen any analyst on any platform, ever.  combine that with the rest of his board... he was very high on devin vassell, very low on patrick williams, wildly high on tyrell terry... all of his bold takes look like total misses so far. you're right that it's too early to judge, though.  and again, i actually think he's worth paying attention to regardless. everyone misses. not everyone is bold enough to have an independent take."
"It doesn't mean that, especially with the Spurs who also have other shooting guards  Devin Vassell got like 17mpg for the Spurs and shot way better than Primo in college"
Lmao I really hope these are just troll comments. One of the reasons that pop is the goat is bc his eye for talent and the ability to develop said talent. Devin vassell was the first lottery pick that pop has had since Duncan. What he's been able to achieve in San Antonio is nothing short of incredible
"even though we are not tanking,we are still rebuilding. murray, lonnie, and keldon all took leaps this year. devin vassell is a really exciting prospect and he looked great last year and with more PT he'll be better."
"no they need to trade Demar lol  Being in no mans land is a bad place to be. Maybe if Devin Vassell wasn't your first lottery pick since Tim Duncan, you would have a good young core"
"Man... you're being *reallllly* easy on your own club.  Not saying Warriors made a bad strategic decision-- you just can't really give them kudos for young guy development post 2012 draft (where they got Harrison Barnes and Draymond).   Paschall was drafted 41st and recently traded straight-up for a protected 2nd round pick-- not really a ""success"", that's breaking even.    So that leaves you with 8 years worth of opportunity, and all you've got is Jordan Poole to show for it. &lt;Sad face&gt;   Since 2013, Spurs have drafted:   2014 Kyle Anderson (30th)   2016 Dejounte Murray (29)   2017 Derrick White (29)   2018 Lonnie Walker (18)   2019 Keldon Johnson (29)   2020 Devin Vassell (11)    Too bad the Spurs didn't have an opportunity to draft at number 2.  I'm jealous."
He's got the body/length to be a successful player. Looks like a Devin Vassell clone.
"Lonnie Walker, Devin Vassell, Josh Primo, and Bryn Forbes are not players you put around ben Simmons in a half court offense. We literally have 4 years of game-play to show that this man is not some LeBron/Luka esque offensive initiator, he needs another creator next to him and us trading away DJ AND Derrick does not help that whatsoever.    The only thing this trade does is put Ben Simmons in an even worse situation than the one he was in before, and give the Spurs a lineup construction that makes no sense whatsoever. Once again there is no logic in this. What do you expect a lineup of; Simmons/Walker/ Johnson/ Young/ Poeltl to do in the western conference???"
"I’m betting on San Antonio.   I think it’ll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I’m going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D’Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I’ll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I’d probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it’s not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they’d be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I’ll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don’t see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn’t take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
I more want to see Derrick White unleashed  Also I want to see more Devin Vassell
&gt; You all are sleeping on Devin Vassell though...  Ok now you're making these names up
"I was seriously debating including Devin Vassell, but he's not as far along as Keldon Johnson. Maybe next year he enters the conversation but right now he's trailing behind the other 4.  I'm very torn on Derrick White, he is 27 but he's had a few stretches where he showed that he has the potential to be a fringe All Star, but hasn't put it together yet. But to be fair he's been injured a decent chunk of the time and with DeRozan gone he's probably going to get more play. I'm waiting to see how he does next season before writing him off yet."
"Derrick White's already 27, he likely won't improve much more, at least to an all-star level. You all are sleeping on Devin Vassell though..."
"What I'm saying, mind you, is based on the play patterns of a group of players with a few hundred, at most, NBA games under their belts. It also relies on Derrick White staying healthy for the majority of the season which is certainly not a safe bet.   Projecting the playing time and rate distribution for a team over the course of an entire season is difficult and the difficultly level grows exponentially with each piece in the rotation that is adjusted.   For example, if you asked me to give you the likelihood of a player leading the Dallas Mavericks in possessions used next season I would break it down something like this:   Luka Doncic - 95%  THJ - 2.5%  Kristaps Porzingis - 1.5%   Other - 1%  If I was answering the question for the Spurs it would look, roughly, like this:   Derrick White - 35%  Dejounte Murray - 30%  Keldon Johnson - 19%   Lonnie Walker - 7%   Tre Jones - 3%  Josh Primo - 2%   Devin Vassell - 1.5%   Other - 2.5%"
"DeJounte Murray, and my hopeful wildcard is one or all of Lonnie Walker/Devin Vassell/Kelson Johnson."
"“Dudes like Devin Vassell”… Yeah, you know basically our highest pick since TD other than Primo. Watch more games; Thad not sniffing top 8 on this team."
Let's go Devin Vassell!   Looks like he's finally playing his way into extended minutes. He's going to be a two way star.
Devin Vassell was my boy in the 2020 draft. Top steal. Think he has the chance to lead this Spurs team.
Devin vassell is the greatest player to wear the number 24 all time
"So a couple things:   1. Time is lost by waiting.  Obviously not a day or a week, but if the season goes by without a trade, that is a lost year and Embiid, while enormously talented, is not a star player I would be patient building a team around.  He has very serious injury considerations that could limit the Sixers window.     2, The other thing that is lost is Simmons' potential fitness.  There have been guys who if they've been away from the game a certain period of time, they show back up out of shape and may not be the same player.  After the 98 lockout, Shawn Kemp gained a ton of weight and was never really the same.  Dennis Scott too, fwiw.     3. The alternative is not peanuts.  If Lillard doesn't want to be moved, its not like the alternative is just to trade Ben for some second round picks.  Other teams have younger players with some upside who could fit well with Embiid. If the Spurs for example offered Derrick White, Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson for Simmons and Curry, that seems like a good match.  Sure none of them are all stars but they could fit very well with the Sixers as it stands. And that dovetails into my last point:     4. The Bucks just proved you don't need a 'superteam' to win the championship.  They won it with an MVP player and other rotational players that fit very well with Giannis, and then they went out and got Jrue Holiday without giving up a whole lot in terms of talented players.  They got him with mostly draft picks.  So getting rotation players that fit with Embiid doesn't foreclose on the Sixers chip hopes."
"We're going 82-0, Primo is going to be Jordan without the crippling gambling addiction &amp; male pattern baldness and Devin Vassell is getting MIP, 6MOY, MVP, DPOY &amp; FMVP this year. A little optimistic but nothing too crazy."

Devin Vassell will be our superstar
Future all star Devin Vassell
"Weird way of spelling ""Devin Vassell""."
&gt; Vassell is a better 3point shooter at this point  Vassell shot 35% from 3 last year. Forbes is a career 41% 3 pt shooter. No Devin is not a better 3 pt shooter than Forbes lol
Is Devin vassell the greatest player of all time
Eyyy Devin Vassell has been my boy. Still think he could be the best player on a playoff team one day
"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."
"We don’t play rookies we usually let them play and develop through the g league their first season and let them get rotational minutes after that.   Pretty much the only outliers to that is Kawhi becoming a starter halfway through his rookie year, Devin Vassell getting backup minutes his rookie year, and Luka Samanic not cracking the rotation after his rookie year. Other than that since like 2015 it’s been the same thing G league year one, rotation year 2"
Both Scottie and Raiquan Gray!  I'm expecting a breakout year from Devin Vassell as well. There's so many NBA Noles all the sudden!
"Wanted to point out, I don’t think Devin Vassell and Kabengele were highly recruited coming out of high school. Further proving your point that FSU basketball lately has been developing ALL of their players, not just the super star Jonathan Isaac/Scottie Barnes type players. Leonard Hamilton has been doing a great job getting the absolute most out of that program. During my time at FSU, the basketball team was much more fun to watch than the football team, which had likely never been the case previously."
"What other colleges can stack up with FSU right now in the NBA? I know there are a few, but for being a football school it’s shocking that FSU has to be in the top-5ish?  PG - Scottie Barnes SG - Malik Beasley SF - Terrence Mann PF - Patrick Williams C - Jonathan Isaac  Devin Vassell off the bench"
"Players go to FSU to develop. Scottie could’ve went out and dropped 20/10/4 every game if that was the plan. Instead he worked on playmaking and neutralizing the opponents best defender since he could beat almost anyone 1v1.  Jonathan Issac, Devin Vassell, all these guys commit to FSU on the premise that they might not have the flashiest college years, but if you wanna get paid real money in the league, come and learn to be the best all around player you can be. It really is incredible how well the chemistry is always top tier on these recent FSU teams and how well everyone always works together"
"What Spurs fan isnt happy with Devin Vassell so far? He was great last year for a rookie, especially on defense"
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise. He will become what people hoped Zhaire Smith would be, before he nearly died. - PHO: Mikal Bridges does not take that next step. - POR: Nassir Little top 5 MIP. Larry Nance 6MOY. - SAC: Haliburton and Davion Mitchell will make at least 5 starting backcourts cry this season. - SAS: Devin Vassell still will be disappointing.  - TOR: Khem Birch will average a double double. - UTA: Bojan will be traded before the AS game. - WAS: Gafford will post a pts/blk/reb triple double."
You’d rather have Devin Vassell than Haliburton? Lol..
"I’m optimistic about Kevin Porter Jr., Jaren Jackson Jr., Devin Vassell, Brandon Clarke, Justise Winslow, Dejounte Murray and Lonzo Ball.  Im pessimistic about Marvin Bagley III, James Wiseman and Bol Bol."
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
"A consistent scorer. DJ has been our most consistent this year and Devin Vassell is a legit two way player but still, they aren't all star level scorers. We can compete with alot of teams but if it's a close game in the 4th we don't have that go to guy yet so we can't close out games"
Dejounte Murray Devin Vassell Keldon Johnson Jakob Poeltl Derek White Joshua Primo Lonnie Walker Either Doug McDermott or Drew Eubanks
Yeah Murray. 2nd option is probably Derrick white or Keldon but it slowly but surely is becoming Devin vassell
Thanks! And we do have the idea of consistent shooters like Doug McDermott who didn't play tonight but other than him no one is really consistent. Maybe Devin Vassell if I have to name names
Devin Vassell will be a star. Have a good day
Dejounte Murray  Devin Vassell Josh primo Keldon Johnson  Derrick white  Jakob poeltl Tre Jones  Lonnie Walker
"They’re both interesting because they’re not freakishly good at anything in particular, but through a ton of hard work have turned themselves in all-NBA players. You can’t really say someone is going to be the next LeBron, that’s an unrealistically high bar that requires all time great athleticism + BBIQ. But shit, why can’t DeAndre Hunter (or the Bridges, Reddish, RJ Barrett, Devin Vassell, etc, etc) be Paul George? We’ll probably start seeing a few more Middleton comps for these guys now that he’s got a ring and is a little more high profile."
Devin Vassell
Ziaire Williams and Devin Vassell come to mind from the last 2 drafts.
"Devin Vassell. Elite defender with a solid 3pt shot, reminds me a bit of Kawhi"
Devin Vassell
I’ve got a crazy answer. Devin Vassell
My guys Devin Vassell and Joshua Primo
I think it's pretty clear Pop doesn't care about winning games at all. We're playing ridiculous lineups like Tre Jones - Bryn Forbes - Lonnie Walker - Devin Vassell - Drew Eubanks in the middle of close games and Thad Young played 4 minutes last night while Drew Eubanks got more than 20 minutes.

I mean at worst he gets dunked on by an NBA player. I always wanted to get dunked on by an NBA Player.. Devin Vassell wouldn’t be in my top 30 for this matter but hey I’d take it
cole anthony is better than maxey  immanuel quickley might be better than him but he doesn't get the kind of minutes that maxey has been getting.  he might look worse with more minutes and an increased role  also devin vassell is underrated cause the spurs are kind of bad right now.  vassell is legit tho.  I don't think he's better than maxey right now but he's close enough to be in the conversation
Devin Vassell is gonna be the Star of this Spurs team.
"Our bench was awful this game. I don't think Lonnie will be on the spurs next year.  Wish we kept it closer but it's not really the fault of anyone that matters other than Vassell, we got destroyed when Pop played that Tre Jones - Bryn Forbes - Lonnie Walker - Devin Vassell - Drew Eubanks lineup which isn't surprising at all really."
"Obviously Mobley or Cade would've been huge, Scottie Barnes, etc. but until we know what we have in Primo I'd rather Devin Vassell, Lonnie and Keldon get as many minutes as they can handle.  Not to mention that Dejounte has taken a step this year. He's still not efficient enough and is still frustratingly allergic to the FT line, but he hasn't lowered his efficiency with the larger offensive load and his defense is the best it's been since he made all-defense in 17-18. He can be a starter on a contending team depending on the other pieces."
I love the salt with the W but Devin Vassell looks good. When are you guys playing Primo? Saving him until you guys are the worst team in the league or what lol
I mean. I don't know about that.   Devin Vassell is looking good. Then there's Halliburton and Cole Anthony.   Bane is making a case for most improved.   Then got guys like Sadiq Bey and Quickly who are growing  and contributing and putting up solid numbers.   I think the draft is looking pretty average.  But I wouldn't call it rough just yet.
"I think it's a 3 guard, small ball unit with;  Jalen Brunson Tyler Herro Alex Caruso Cam Reddish Precious Achiuwa (now that he's coming off the bench)   Most of these guys could start on many teams and have shown that. They also play as closers frequently.   As a Spurs fan I had to stop myself from putting Devin Vassell in there for either Brunson or Caruso (although he might play his way in soon at this rate)."
We continue to sleep on Devin Vassell🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️

"Devin "" Kawho"" Vassell"
Don’t disrespect devin like that. It’s Devin “MJ’s daddy” Vassell.
"Devin ""Steph"" Vassell"
"If Thad keeps playing like this we might get decent return for him at the trade deadline, also Devin Vassell is the fucking truth"
"Jalen Brunson: on a team where he isn't forced to play off the ball/come off the bench he could put up some great numbers - I think he is so much better than his stats indicate and is being held back in Dallas.  Moses Moody: one of my favourites from this draft class, can't really get on the court because Warriors.  Malik Beasley: Really talented shooter/scorer, has had a very slow start but they've cut his role/minutes/usage. Kinda sucks because he was in a bad situation (in terms of available minutes) in Denver, and has now been kind of pushed to the side in Minnesota after playing so well for them last year.  Devin Vassell: He's gonna be a star, but in traditional Pop fashion he's being brought along very slowly. He's gonna get minutes eventually there and I know they love him but still wish he was given a bit more leash like he would on another team.  Aaron Nesmith: Talented kid, confidence I think has been an issue for him and don't think Boston for numerous reasons is the best place for him to flourish.  Cam Reddish: Begging to break out, but Atlanta has so many wings that his minutes are capped and inconsistent.  Patrick Williams: He's hurt right now, but I feel like they went into win-now so fast that he's kind of been left behind. He looked amazing in summer league and then barely got shots on the actual team - granted he didn't deserve shots over their other guys but still he has so much potential and I think he would reach it much faster on another team on a better suited timeline for him.  Jordan Nwora: Really talented scorer and showed out a bit with a lot of people hurt, and probably earned a rotation spot - but when everyone is healthy that role gets smaller and smaller. I wonder how he'd do on another team.  Marcus Garrett: Less of a 'free him' and more of a name to watch, he's a crazy defender and I think will be one of those Heat rotation players that comes out of nowhere in a year or two.  Paul Reed: I want to see what he can do as a starting center with big minutes, dude can really play but he's behind Embiid and Drummond (and probably their PFs too)"
"I just think Devin Vassell is pretty clearly the better player and, likely, the higher upside player for the future.   In my opinion, the minutes split should, and will, shift more towards Vassell as time goes on and Pop is less able to justify Lonnie playing more minutes due to seniority."
"Man I remember back in 2015-2016 when kawhi was coming out of his shell and becoming our go to player, there would be moments where he'd score 2-3 times in a row and instead of giving him the ball to take over, we'd completely ignore him, and the same shit is happening with Devin vassell. I don't get why pop just doesn't continue running the offense thru the hot hand"
Devin Vassell is a stud.
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT DEVIN VASSELL?  We were thinking of drafting him before Obi fell to us and I was always curious how he’d pan. Seems to be doing dandy. Spurs fans what’s he been doing to rise so dramatically from his first season?
"DeJounte is great, Devin Vassell is great, Pops rotations suck the last few years, Keldon has been ass this season, and whenever anyone gets hot, they get frozen out for the rest of the game. that about sums up every game for us so far."
and Devin Vassell
I love Devin Vassell  The tank rolls on
"devin vassell is the next spur great, i've seen enough"
"Win-win trade for the Bulls and Spurs..  Spurs were stuck in mediocrity land, landing picks in the teens, unless Devin Vassell or Joshua Primo turn into the second coming of Kawhi. Better to bleed the young'uns and hope for a top 5 lottery pick.  Grab yourselfs some Holgrem, Banchero, Emono Bates or Victor Wembanyama."
This Devin Vassell guy is pretty good.
Devin Vassell is pretty promising.
They had Devin Vassell right there too
"I don't mean to toot our own horn too much, but this makes what the Spurs have done even more exceptional.   Obviously you have huge success stories like Tony Parker or Manu Ginobili....but even in the last 10-ish years we've pulled guys like George Hill, Cory Joseph, Aron Baynes, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, Tre Jones, etc...out of the late first to second rounds, or even undrafted.  Our last three lottery picks were Kawhi (15th), Devin Vassell (14th), and Josh Primo (12th).   Kawhi is obviously Kawhi, Vassell is looking great in his 2nd year, and Primo shows all the signs of a young star in the making.   Sure, we've had some whiffs like Luka Samanic, but that is a lot of success stories coming that late in the draft."
Devin Vassell will be a star
"We have had really good scouting and player development lately. Devin Vassell wasn’t ranked anywhere when we offered him, and two years later he’s a lotto pick to you all.   If you’re curious, the names to watch on the current FSU team for the 2022 draft are SF Matt Cleveland and SG Caleb Mills. Both are NBA guys, just a matter of when they make that jump."
