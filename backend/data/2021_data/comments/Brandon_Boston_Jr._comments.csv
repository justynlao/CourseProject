Lob from Brandon Boston Jr
They did not watch Brandon Boston JR and it shows
"&gt; They spent Adams, Bledsoe, Ziare Williams, Jared Butler, Lonzo, the Lakers 2022 FRP, and their 2022 FRP (lottery protected), for Graham, Valunciunas, Trey Murphy III, Brandon Boston Jr, Temple, Satoransky, and a second round pick  I'm going to try to recontextualize because I really think you're overstating ""3 first round picks"" here  That also means they sent ~$60.5 million on the books next year for  Lonzo for ~$41.25 million incoming, which leaves them about $97.22 million on roster currently. They've got a qualifying offer in to Josh Hart, and it'll be interesting to see what happens there, but they can spend almost $40 million extra next year before hitting the luxury tax. They don't have the big moves they need this year, but they could fill that space with some young, high upside guys for now like THT, Bruce Brown, maybe even Ntilikina if they want to gamble, or if they wanna pull the trigger on a larger contract and miss Hart they could go after Kendrick Nunn, Dennis Shroeder, Malik Monk, or potentially even Lauri Markkanen.  **TL;DR they pick swapped two picks, gave a Lakers pick, gave a lotto protected first, and lost Lonzo to make $20,000,000 of cap space, ditch 2 of their worst fits, add Graham and Valunciunas, and flesh out the bench a tiny bit. I don't think that's an awful situation, especially given that Lonzo could have just walked sans sign-and-trade**"
We‚Äôre sending Brandon Boston Jr. WHO WAS ON CRACK (judging from his college career) to rehab and he‚Äôll come back better than Kawhi and PG combined
Brandon Boston Jr was a steal for the Clippers.  Josh Giddy was the right choice for OKC.  Charlotte won the draft and the Knicks made a bad trade for future picks.
I guarantee when brandon boston jr gets drafted ESPN is gonna go for the sob story of him witnessing Terence Clarke‚Äôs death
brandon boston jr is my wild pick
"the funniest part is that this isn't even the craziest episode  they once had Bill Belichick, Lizzo, Brandon Boston Jr, and Kim Jong Un on an episode. Absolutely nuts..."
Brandon Boston Jr.  Was highly touted coming of HS--[This is using post-HS rankings](https://twitter.com/espn/status/1331292376841809923). Dropped all the way to the late second round after a disastrous college season.
Brandon Boston Jr
Brandon Boston Jr.
Brandon Boston jr looks like ten years younger than anyone else out there. That dude needs a beard ASAP
All three rookies are suppose to bring something different and fill needs down the line. Jason Preston=Ceiling is a floor general decent size guard that loves the pick and roll. Injured his foot and may miss half the season but Lue mentioned he‚Äôs picking up schemes and asking lots of questions   Keon Johnson= the super athlete and energetic defender. Guy is very raw on offense and his overall game will need work but only 19 and should show signs of being a lockdown defender in a few years.  Brandon Boston Jr= the scorer! There is no shot he‚Äôs afraid to take and he will take it while having a nice handle with great range.  Extreme confidence
"I‚Äôm happy we kept Mann, he softened the blow on losing Shai. Honestly Brandon Boston Jr is getting up there too. He has so much confidence he just needs to polish his game."
brandon boston jr is a motherfucking bucket
BRANDON BOSTON JR IS THE NEXT KEVIN DURANT
Brandon Boston Jr is going to be pretty good. He's going average 12 mpg and 4.8/1.8/0.4 splits this season.  I got high hopes.
Clips are finding a bunch of quality players in the late round..  Terance Mann now Brandon Boston Jr. is looking really nice too!

I really wished that Boston drafted Brandon Boston Jr. in this year‚Äôs draft lol.  Now I‚Äôm rooting for Houston to draft Caleb Houstan in 2022.
"for homer reasons  Terance Mann, Luke Kennard, Brandon Boston Jr, Morris, Batum"
Brandon Boston Jr dropped 46 tonight in the G league üëç  Same thing as playing vs the Blazers defense
"The discrepancy between Ziaire Williams and Brandon Boston Jr didn't really make sense, both were highly touted recruits with really disappointing freshman seasons but one guy got taken 10th and one guy got taken 51st.  I'm assuming Jerry West did it again."
"Yea Brandon Boston Jr was out there playing wild lol, hopefully he learns from this."
BRANDON BOSTON JR!
Brandon Boston jr is gonna be something y‚Äôall.
AWAKEN BRANDON BOSTON JR. THE RITUAL IS COMPLETE.
Brandon Boston Jr is going to be a solid rotation player by '23-'24.
Brandon Boston jr.
Brandon Boston Jr.
I hope Brandon Boston Jr gets some minutes when the Clips and Lakers play so we can hear again about how weird it is for Lebron to be playing his son's former teammates.
