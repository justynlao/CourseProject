That’s Corey Kispert Senior
I saw a mock draft today where we were projected to get the 13th and 16th pick in the draft and we landed Corey Kispert and Jaden Springer. I mean that'd be a fantastic first round for us. I'm more than happy with how the trade has turned out for us even though we didn't sign KD and another max FA

"so you're saying 6 years from now we are going to get the 8 seed twice in a row after a long drought, take some 1-0 leads, and WCJ gonna be a 2 time all star before we trade him at 30 to the Celtics or some shit while also offloading Corey Kispert and some random euro sg?"
"I never said the #1 pick couldn’t play on a great college team. Yes Suggs is playing well, but he also has the 2nd best post player in college and the best shooter in the nation along side him. he did not have a better year than Cade. Stay wise or production wise. And when talking about NBA PROSPECTS. A 6’8 lead ball handler that’s an elite PnR player, elite iso player, switchable defensively, a 40% volume shooter 3pt shooter, and high level playmaker isn’t getting passed up on again.   Give Cade Cunningham JUST Drew Timmie and Corey Kispert and he would look like the best PG prospect we’ve ever seen."

Corey Kispert is 6’7” and is the third guy since ‘97 to shoot 50/40/90 in college (55/46/90 this year). His game is basically perfect for translating to the NBA. Could end up being somewhere between Joe Harris and Klay Thompson
Corey Kispert
"I mean Gonzaga has 3 players on the tankathon big board this year. Jalen Suggs (2), Corey kispert (8), and Joel ayayi (31). They’ll probably make NBA rosters. And I’d be willing to bet money on at least one other player currently on that team going in the first round either next year or the year after."

Didn't even know that was his brother. Rather have him than Corey Kispert.
Wiseman sucks trade him for corey kispert or Giddey on draft night
Corey Kispert is who I'm hoping for. He's a perfect fit tbh.
"Barring a direction change based on the new ownership, the team seems to be barreling forward with KAT + Russell as their foundation of the future. That is in part why they took Ant Man #1 over LaMelo--too much overlap between LaMelo and Russell.   With that in mind, the top picks in this draft mostly seem to present the same issue once you add Ant Man to the mix.   With all that said, wouldn't it behoove the Wolves to look at trading back to add some more immediate punch to their team? There's going to be a rebuilding team or two that desperately needs some foundational talent and is going to get unlucky in the lottery, if the Wolves could trade back to 5th-8th they could nab someone like Jonathan Kuminga, Jalen Johnson, Scottie Barnes, or Corey Kispert that would pair great with the core they already have.  Here's three potential deals I could see  A package involving Al Horford + #5  Larry Nance Jr. + #6  Marvin Bagley  + #7  These all help the Wolves get more veteran help to be more competitive in the next year (when they'll owe their pick unprotected) while still drafting a high level talent that better compliments the core they already have invested in."

"If any team is wanting Joe Harris on their team for next year, draft Corey Kispert from Gonzaga in the next upcoming draft.  Should be anywhere in the 9-14 range, plays exactly like Harris and best spot up shooter in the draft"
"So yeah, this is based on who i think will go higher, not who I think is better. I don’t think Mitchell is a lottery talent, but so many mocks I’ve seen have him as high as 6, I think he goes in the lottery, for better or for worse.  Another one is Isaiah Jackson vs Sengun.  I like Sengun better, but knowing Charlotte’s affinity for going for high profile college guys (plus the Kentucky pedigree) that I think they go Jackson.  Jalen Johnson vs Franz Wagner vs Corey Kispert also has me unsure where they are going to go.  Jalen clearly has the most upside but I really don’t know how much his “diva” antics at Duke will push him down. The opposite for Kispert - I think his defense is really sus, but his box score numbers might be super attractive to a higher lottery team to grab him"

Also Corey Kispert
Corey Kispert for sure going round 1. Very Klay Thompson like.
"We're not gonna win a ring with Russ/Beal, but it's not like fucking Corey Kispert would've been the missing piece for a Wall/Beal ring either.  We've had a pretty fun season once we got rolling and next season will probably be fun too."
Corey Kispert is a draft pick that in 3 years no one will understand why he was even drafted.

Corey Kispert lmao can't wait to see which team is suckered into drafting him
"Other people have mentioned this, but I think Kuminga falls. I think his reputation from preps play kept him high in mock drafts, but we are getting no buzz about some team being super into him and I just am not convinced he is actually that good or that high upside.   Assuming Barnes goes top 5, I think the Thunder take Giddey at 6, highest upside player they could find there.  If he falls past them, I actually think the Warriors take him.  And Magic take Moody if the Warriors don't.  Wagner goes to Kings at 9 and is actually a good pick.  Knicks draft Sharife, Thibs loves quick guards and they could use someone that can get to the rim and make plays even without spacing.  Their other pick could be a shooter, like Chris Duarte, a good fit in a Thibs offense, Corey Kispert, or Trey Murphy.  Bucks draft Joel Ayayi.  Might be wrong, but that is the vibe I get based on what I know of the sorts of players Bucks typically value.  All around player from a good NCAA team who can play off the ball well.  I could see them taking Neemias Queta too.  I think Keon Johnson might be a draft slider, while I think Springer actually goes to Pacers at 13.  Tough for non-shooting guards in the league, have to have special characteristics."
"Why not get the win-now pick at 14th though? They worked out Chris Duarte, Corey Kispert, and Trey Murphy III yesterday who all could easily go 14th (hard to see Kispert last til 14th though.) They could use the 7th on a higher ceiling player like Bouknight, Moody, or Giddey."

"They definitely won’t make it within the next season or two, but they can (obviously) make some decisions to help themselves in the long term.   - Fire Luke Walton and look into a young assistant that will let Fox and Hali play faster   - Keep that backcourt together by any means possible  - Get an athletic rim-running center (In the Capela mold) if Holmes doesn’t come back  - Look into trading Barnes, Hield, and Bagley. Barnes, although a very solid player, doesn’t really fit the timeline. Hield is already 28 and might stunt Halliburton’s growth. And Bagley is toxic and should be traded just for the locker-room’s sake.   - Take Corey Kispert at 9. Might be looked at as a reach, but he’s a Joe Harris type of player that will provide elite spacing for those guards to operate.   - Take fliers on young players similar to Detroit with Josh Jackson and DSJ last year. There’s nothing to lose, and they might find a diamond in the rough."
TJ McConnell passing to Corey Kispert...who says no
No if so Corey Kispert would be top 3 pick
"If I'm late lottery (picks 10+), I'd be pretty happy drafting Corey Kispert. He's great at probably the most valuable thing in basketball. It's a shame the Kings image is so bad that no matter who they pick, it almost taints the player's image too."

What do you think of Corey Kispert at 14th or maybe even 7? A solid three point shooting wing that can take a load off Klay and help ease him back into playoff minutes.
"Maybe, but it seems like there are some older guys like Davion Mitchell or Corey Kispert going around 14 that could probably start for us.  Both of them might go higher than that but maybe we'll get lucky who knows."
"This is banking on Klay coming back in good form, and would leave you all with the 14th pick which you could use to draft an immediate shooter/contributor like corey kispert. Pascal straight feasts as a 2nd/3rd option and next to draymond could likely play as deadly two-way 4/5 small ball combo."

Corey Kispert here we go
"Malcom ""I know better than the coaches"" Brogdon is officially on a short leash now. He was a big proponent of running McMillan off &amp; also heavily consulted to ensure that Bjorkren was the kind of coach he would listen to. We all like him as a player but those days are over for him in Indy now. Shape up or ship out like with Vic.   Good news is what he will be able to to with a guy like TJ Warren. He's got a similar game that Rip had in Detroit and Carlisle definitely elevated Hamilton. Sumner should be in line for continued opportunities to prove he's now fully rotation ready as well. Sumner's attitude and willingness to work hard on his game will go a long way with Carlisle as well.   Now all Carlise needs to do is steer the team in the direction of landing Corey Kispert in the draft so McDermott eventual departure this summer for a bigger payday is barely felt and we should see a fresh rested and healthy squad ready for the 2021/2022 season."
Corey Kispert come on down.
"Could get Corey kispert with that 10th pick. His outside shooting would be another asset for Detroit. Similar to what Atlanta puts around Trae young, put shooters around Cade and watch him flourish"
"Corey Kispert way better than Kuminga, should be going top 5 confirmed.  Source: ????"
Thank you. In my 7 minutes of research I can't believe how much people sleep on Corey Kispert
It could be smart to stay put honestly. I doubt teams would give up that good a veteran for those picks in the off-season. They are in prime position to maybe get Davion Mitchell and Corey Kispert who would fill needs and should contribute right away.
"Every draft pick is hit or miss, last year Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane, Tyrese Haliburton, and Payton Prichard these are the types I am talking about. Chris Duarte, Trey Murphy III, Corey Kispert, James Bouknight, and Davion Mitchell. These are more seasoned then your typical one and dones."
They should take Moses Moody and Corey Kispert
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"

"Scottie Barnes is such a Warriors brand of player tho, he’s a switchable defender, 6’9, can make play and read the floor well.  But I guess your Team want more offensive talent?  Corey Kispert and Chris Duarte would be good Fit with NBA ready to contribute"

"Naw I’m familiar with the class. It’s a great class but it’s top heavy. Realistically at 16, the guys in that range who we were gonna be looking at was Jalen Johnson, Isaiah Jackson, Tre Mann and Like Corey Kispert. Good prospects sure, but outside of like Mann I’m not upset about not being able to get any of those guys or more guys in that range if it meant getting off Kemba’s deal"
"Carlisle traditionally has not played rookies and Duarte is about the highest floor prospect in the draft. He'll be able to slide in and contribute immediately.  When you're as ""win-now"" as the Pacers are it doesn't really bode well for player development so getting a plug-and-play like Duarte makes a lot of sense for us.   I was high on either Franz Wagner or Josh Giddey but both of those guys were off the board by then. A couple of guys in a similar vein to Duarte that were available were Corey Kispert and Moses Moody.   Apparently GSW really wanted Duarte since they're trying to make the most of the rest of their core's prime."
Corey Kispert had one good game and was very inconsistent
"Trez/Kuz (or Rui - whichever comes off bench)/Deni Avdija/KCP/A. Holiday is a nice one, but it was just assembled so we're not sure how they'll gel.  On paper though, I'm a fan of that lineup as a bench 5. Then Neto &amp; Corey Kispert as the deep benchers."
Jaren Jackson Jr is younger than the following 2021 1st round draft picks:  * Davion Mitchell * Chris Duarte * Corey Kispert
Corey Kispert &gt;&gt;Sengun
"Corey Kispert played in a weak conference and is unathletic and was a worse college player than Sam and he went 15. Shooting is valuable   Im not saying Sam’s gonna be a star or anything but going off the utah state tape and the little he’s shown in the league, he’s definitely an NBA player. The Grizzlies have been the smartest team in the league lately when it comes to drafting and finding undervalued players, so I think they agree and it’s not just a trade for the picks. But we’ll see I guess"
I Remember a couple weeks ago someone saying Corey Kispert is already better than NAW lmao
"Assuming starters are Dinwiddie/Beal/KCP/Rui/Bryant, then the bench has Kuzma, Montrezl, Gafford, Avdija, Bertans, Aaron Holiday, Neto and the rookies (Corey Kispert, Isaiah Todd).  It’s a deep bench."
looks like we got the real Corey Kispert after all
"Corey Kispert looks like he's gonna answer his first set of questions with ""well getting the vaccine is a personal decision and you're violating my hippo rights"""
"&gt; Corey Kispert  (#15 overall pick) could have gone undrafted, to be honest. Shooting is easy to come by in the NBA.   Eh, 15 is not a particularly high pick and you’re realistically hoping for a serviceable starter with 15 . Elite shooting is not easy to come by, and if he can help space the floor and be a good but not great player in other ways, that’s good value for pick 15."
Like Corey Kispert is basically a Korver/Reddick type player.
"I swear, people on this sub don't actually watch college basketball. Suggs was not their best player. He had a great tournament run, but Drew Timme was pretty clearly the best player on Gonzaga's team, and Corey Kispert (who won their conference's player of the year award) was the second best. I'd slot Suggs in right after both of them.  Suggs is just the far better prospect overall three, and will be the best pro."
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
Weiskamp is gonna be the steal of the draft and I believe he will be better than Corey Kispert.
"He's a 3&amp;D guy, hes a shooter  a spot up shooter is still a shooter  That's like saying Corey Kispert is not a shooter because he profiles as as spot up guy rather than a pull up guy"

Guys like Moses Moody and Corey Kispert are projected to be NBA ready but they are pretty far away from being complete prospects.

"I feel like teams are getting WAY smarter. The top-20 is usually now littered with guys who you are pretty sure are going to have an impact (aside from stupid talented 18 year old freaks like Mo Bamba).  Examples of this - Huerter's jump in 2018 (long and elite shooter), Cam Johnson, Desmond Bane jumping to the 1st round, Herro's jump, Clarke's jump, etc. I feel like teams are really emphasizing skill and NBA-readiness more than ever before.  Guys like Bol Bol, Nassir Little, Darius Bazley, Kevin Knox, KPorter (he panned out), Hamidou Diallo, etc. all saw big drops in their draft stock from where they were projected by general media  I think we see some guys like Corey Kispert, Kessler Edwards, Joe Wieskamp, Trey Murphy, etc. go before super ""talented"" guys like Keon and Kai Jones. I see Kuminga taking a big slide as well."
"I agree with you there, but we’re talking about the Pelicans having a generation player right now in Zion where there were reports that came out less than a month ago that his family didn’t like him there. The organization has to show some kind of progress it seems for Zion and his team to remain happy. I think they would’ve kept SVG around if that weren’t the case.   Vet role players even if they are more expensive are more dependable. It’s unrealistic and unfair to expect rookie Corey Kispert to help the Pelicans get to the playoffs in the western conference as a quality role player."
"&gt; but If you’re drafting Kispert to be a role player shooter why not target a vet who knows his role and plays it well over an unproven guy?  Duncan Robinson will command 15 - 20 M for 3/4 years. Around $80M dollars.  Mikal Bridges makes around 4.5 M a year. His rookie contract is 4 year / $17,630,685 drafted at 10th overall. Corey Kispert's range is anywhere from Kings at 9, Pelicans at 10, Warriors 14, etc.   Cap space bro. This ain't Manchester City. You just saved yourself over $60 million."

"This season Marcus Smart is averaging 7 3PA a game and is making them at....(wait for it..) 23.5%  Why in gods name is Smart taking so many threes. Also if Tatum is awful the Celtics suck.   This game was a difference in depth. Tatum and Beal were both trash but the Wiz have too much depth. JB was also really bad this game.   The Celtics last guy on the rotation is a washed Jabari Parker, Grant Williams, Josh Richardson compared to the Wiz who are running the rookie Corey Kispert who actually looks really solid so far on both ends of the court, Deni Avdija who also plays solid D and can ball handle, Aaron Holiday who is looking like a steal of a pick-up for PG depth and Bertans who is still capable of being a good NBA player even though he's been pretty bad at doing what he's paid to do which is shoot the ball. Juancho needs to work his way into the rotation for Boston, he's a solid player."

"Their 12 would be:   Corey Kispert, Cole Anthony, Sekou Doumbouya, Troy Brown Jr, Justin Jackson, Juancho Hernangomez, Kelly Oubre Jr, Adreian Payne, Giannis Antetoukounmpo, Mo Harkless, Kawhi Leonard, Larry Sanders.   So something like Anthony, Oubre Jr, Kawhi, Giannis, Hernangomez - Brown Jr, Kispert, Harkless, Jackson, Sanders - Payne, Doumbouya."
Who was your preferred choice? The next 3 to be taken was Corey Kispert
in my heart yes. in reality it is Corey Kispert:  https://twitter.com/FredKatz/status/1464805601498783749  (please don't provide any stats to the contrary)
"I think that Corey Kispert will be better than Luke Harangody but definitely not better than Doug McDermott.   I'm sorry, I know I'm making lazy white-on-white comps. I try not to but I think it's about right in this case."
Ladies and gentlemen…. Corey F’n Kispert
Small sample size right now but Corey Kispert doesn’t seem as NBA ready as advertised.
I completely forgot Corey Kispert existed until I read this
"None of those players really change much.  Losing Bertans has probably been a net positive given how poorly he’s played.   Where does Bryant fit into the center rotation? Much of the team’s success can be attributed to great defensive center play from Gafford and a career year, so far, from Harrell. There’s no reason to disrupt the current Center rotation unless Harrell’s play falls off massively. At this point Bryant looks more like depth than an every night rotation player.   Rui coming back means that you can cut Aaron Holiday and Corey Kispert out of the rotation but that would mean a lot of Kuzma + Rui minutes which wouldn’t exactly be my favorite forward pairing.   The rest of the minutes for Rui have to come from Kuzma, KCP, and Beal which leaves me thinking that Rui may not be seeing as many minutes as we would have thought coming into the season."
I see you Corey Kispert.
I for one cannot believe Corey Kispert isn’t here
"Former Gonzaga teammate and current Wizards rookie Corey Kispert: “I’ve seen him a few times here in the practice facility, just kind of checking in, and he’s been in good spirits. So I’m happy for him, making the strides he needs to make, and I think he’ll be back sooner rather than later.”   Unseld said Kispert’s assessment wasn’t far off."
