"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"
Mike Conley
"Mike Conley  Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Junior, Kyle Anderson, Jimmy Buckets"
"Mike Conley. People forget this man was part of the Grizzlies roster alongside Marc Gasol that made the WCF. Plus he had to play against Steph, Dame, Russ, Harden (when he played PG), pre-Lakers Steve Nash, Chris Paul, and many more. Never had a shot of making the All-Star team, until this year. I would say his name and Donovan Mitchell's name (but I had to do only 1 Jazz player) at the top even if I wasn't a Jazz fan.  Honorable mentions: Dame, Giannis, Al Horford, and Paul Millsap."
"Jimmy Butler, Kemba Walker, Paul Millsap, Mike Conley, DeMar Derozen."
"uhhhh just off the top of my head, here are my picks:  Donovan Mitchell Rudy Gobert Royce O’neale Mike Conley Bojan Bogdanovic"
Mike Conley
#Mountain Mike Conley is an All-Star
That's 2021 NBA All-Star Mike Conley
Conley  Mike Bibby or Cj McCullum  Petrovic  Rudy Gay  Sabonis
And Mike Conley
"Prime Mike Bibby I think should be on that list, though he's not as good as Conley, and unfortunately his prime wasn't very long.      Camby and Odom are the two most decorated guys not to make All-Star.  It's pretty crazy how Camby won DPOY and a lot of defensive teams but never made an All-Star.  I guess Shaq was always going to make it, but looking back, it's kind of weird that Jermaine O'Neal kept making All-Star teams when he wasn't really a good offensive player, he was just a guy that got the ball a lot.  Camby probably had more impact on winning for at least a few years of their primes."
"At the end of the day, voters are going to vote Mike Conley because he’s at the top of the league in advanced impact metrics."
"There's not really any top-tier true point guards anymore though. Steph would definitely be a combo guard 20 years ago, but what pass-first guys are there to compare him to? CP3 is probably the last bastion for a true franchise PG, and after him you have guys like Mike Conley and Ricky Rubio, who are very good players, but more specific role guys. Almost all the top point guards today except for CP3 would be considered combo guards. He's more the exception than the rule now."
"Any chance that Ja Morant gets a nod as a wildcard? If there's an emphasis on winning teams then let me remind you that the Grizzlies are the fourth seed right now.  Ja Morant: 20.7/2.1/7.7 on .539/.300/.806 (2.9 3PA). The rebounding and 3-point percentage is suspect, but for a guard he's scoring very efficiently from the field.   If the guards are locked up between Dame, Steph, Luka and Donovan Mitchell then I could see someone trying to make an argument for Ja over someone like Devin Booker for a wildcard. Also for what it's worth, SGA and DeAaron Fox are playing pretty hot right now and are putting up statlines similar to Booker but they're both on losing teams.  For what it's worth, I just don't see either Mike Conley or CP3 making it this year. Not at 16 PPG."
Is it time for Mike Conley?
"Well alright then, MIKE CONLEY TO THE MOON"
"With Harden gone, a guard spot seems to finally open up in the West, but then Mike Conley is around.  There is the spot left open with Klay not playing though."
Mike Conley
"Mike and Kyle were both really raw during their time together. At the time, I was upset we traded Lowry and kept Conley. It wasn’t 100% clear which one was better than the other."
"I'd put Mike Conley as of today because he's been very impactful (leader in +/-), Luka is considered a Point Guard so maybe it's a tossup between Book and Fox whoever has the better record prior to the allstar"
I voted for Mike Conley
You don’t have to make adjustments when Mike Conley decides to re enter his prime out of nowhere
"Chris Paul/Mike Conley old man guards starting for the west, please."
"If he ends up being a better Mike Conley I will just be over the moon. Mike Conley was my comp for him when we drafted him (everyone was saying Wall, which I honestly don't think is accurate)"
"He’s like a faster, longer Mike Conley"
"Conley isn't the same player he was last year, he's much more adjusted to the offense and his role. He looks like the Mike Conley we wanted to trade for in the first place  Bogdanovic is back and finally rolling coming back from wrist surgery, which held him out in the playoffs. He was a 20 PPG scorer last year  Favors has returned and looks great, especially defensively. He's been a big reason as to why our bench unit is so much more successful than last year when we were throwing out Tony Bradley and the corpse of Ed Davis whenever Gobert was sitting or injured  Royce O'Neale keeps steadily improving  Jordan Clarkson looks even better than he did for us last season after we traded for him"
"All star games are supposed to be fun. I always vote for the players that are the most fun to watch. No offense to Mike Conley, but I'd rather see Ja in the all star game."
I'm not trusting a stat that has Mike Conley as the most impactful player in the NBA and Jakob Poetl as the 5th
"**Most Dominant Player:** Joel Embiid  **Most Impactful Free Agent Signing:** Gordon Hayward  **Most Dangerous Lineup That Doesn’t Actually Play:** Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Nicolas Batum, Serge Ibaka, Marcus Morris Sr.  **All-Around Strangest Development:** Andrew Wiggins becoming mini Mutombo  **Breakout Sidekick:** De’Andre Hunter  **Sunniest Bounce Back:** Mike Conley  **Most Concerning Start (That Actually Matters):** Josh Richardson"
What's wrong with this? Mike Conley is the only real outlier and he is having a fantastic season
&gt;no one wants to talk about curry coming back too soon   What a straw man... that’s literally all we hear about lol curry gets a million excuses yet bringing up mike Conley was playing with a fractured face and tony Allen had a serious ham string injury is too much?   &gt;if that was tony Allen at 60%   You literally just said it yourself he got played off the floor that point. He got played off the floor while he was hobbled lmao you can’t even see the own double standard in your comments  The “adjustment” the warriors made was possible because Allen couldn’t play defense like he did earlier in the series and couldn’t move off ball like he normally does so that made him a liability
"I hate that basketball talk has now evolved into people posting advanced impact metrics with no context. It’s even more hilarious to see +- stats and fucking WS used especially this early in the season.   With that same logic, Mike Conley, PG, and Luka are all better than KD as well."

You are mostly right. Mike Conley being 1 inch away on 1 shot in 1 game changed the narratives of 2 teams going forward.
I don't think Zion will make the team.  he is a sieve on defense and they need at least one big like Bam or Myles Turner to defend the likes of Jokic and Vucevic.  And they would probably give Trae's spot to one of the older guards that would want to go like Mike Conley or Chris Paul.  Trae and Zion's time would probably come in 2024.
"Shumpert D-Wade 2.0, Ntilikina Mike Conley 2.0.. List goes on and on. They just don't get that Barrett will never reach the level Zach has reached."
Haha Mike Conley washed  Bojan Bogdanovic? More like Bojan.. uh.. BetterStartHittingQuick lmao  Jordan Clarkson? Loser who is a loser with ugly tattoos  Joe Ingles has been jingled  Royce O'Neale wants to be Shaq so bad he changed his last name
"Did you forget that the playoff series was a down and out Mike Conley basket away from the Jazz winning, almost every game in that series was either a coin flip or a jazz blowout, and that we already beat the Nuggs this year to split 1-1?"
"I mean, OP didn't say a good coach.  OP stated an NBA coach.  I could see CP3 as a good x's and o's guy who ends up pissing off the team star/management eventually and getting fired.  The guy who becomes a good to great coach will probably be someone more low key like Mike Conley Jr. or some guy who is a bench player/13th man type person."
Damn imagine hating on Mike Conley.
"since +/- apparently matters to jazz fans, allstar Mike Conley was a game-worst -18"
"since +/- apparently matters to jazz fans, allstar Mike Conley was a game-worst -18"
If not for the mike Conley and Allen injury I really don’t think the warriors make the finals in 15  They had a 2-1 lead with mike Conley playing with a caved in eye socket and then Allen got injured too and that was just the final nail in the coffin
I could see Mike Conley being a coach.
Maybe we’ll finally stop getting mike Conley +/- posts after this game
Mike Conley is not that much bigger than Campazzo
Nah Mike Conley
"get ready for it to be posted again in like 5 hours, we play in 2 hours and that mike conley plus minus is only gonna increase baby"
really hope the coaches put Mike Conley in the All-star game over Gobert.
"This season is just a really strong season for big men.  538 rates Jokic, Embiid, AD and Gobert all as top-10 players in the league right now.  Not that RAPTOR score is the perfect rating system. I won’t try to argue that Mike Conley is the #1 player in the league, but all 4 have been playing great and one of them will be unfairly left off the All-NBA team this year if AD is considered a center."
"huh  \&gt;Kyle Lowry is a free agent but will likely get a bigger deal, Mike Conley is too old, Goran Dragic is too old and Spencer Dinwiddie will be coming off of an ACL injury. For the price that Lonzo would cost, it is clear that he would be the best option for the Los Angeles Lakers."
Is Mike Conley that far behind?
Cp3 avg 15 and 9 for the season has been killing it the last 5 games with Book out he does have a case over Mike Conley
dont love admitting it but mike conley has been clearly better than cp3 so far.  Tbf I also take him over mitchell right now too
Even someone like Kyle Lowry. Mike Conley.
"I love Mike Conley he’s definitely getting my vote, y’all should really go into each sub and try to create as much handshake agreements as possible"
"nah. for example, mike conley hasnt won any sort of accolade and hes trash"
Depends on your definition of great. If you think Mike Conley is great then yes. If you don't think he's great then no.
"If you are putting up numbers that would get you into ""this is a great player"" conversation you'd likely have an award of some sort, or at least you become a Mike Conley type of, ""How has this player never been an All Star"" which is kind of an award by proxy?  Without such accolades you shift into the ""This guy was a very good player with limitations"" like a Robert Horry/Steve Kerr type who were considered good players who had great moments, but aren't talked about as legends or considered ""greats"""
"It's simple, all we need to do is rig the vote enough to get Mike Conley in.  Jazz &amp; Grizz fans already voting for Mountain Mike, and we've already gotten a handshake deal w/ the Knicks sub to get their votes in exchange for our voting for Randle.    We got 6 more position votes to sell, baby!"
Hmmm Mike Conley as a starter in the West? Let’s do Win Shares
"Mike was playing with that new baby energy against the Nuggets. He looked great on offense when he came back into the bubble. However, there are still some noticeable differences between Conley this year and Conley in the bubble. I think his defense has been noticeably better for us this year, and his control of the offense is noticably better. Mike may have shot it better in the bubble, but he has been awesome this year at initiating Quin's blender offense. More specifically, his pick and roll game with Rudy is night and day improved, and is one of the deadlier PnR combos in the league this year"
"Mike Conley is STILL massively underrated.  Also, whoever is working witchcraft with the Spurs."
"&gt;  Lillard, Mitchell, Curry, Luka, and Booker have all been better this far. I wish more people voted on how well a player has been performing and less on whether they deserve it or not because of how cool they are.  Booker has not been better lol. Also, Mike Conley is leading the team with the best record in the NBA -- he's performing pretty damn well."
Mike Conley went from not an all star to mvp candidate at the age of 33

Mike Conley with ridiculously high +/- . I think its around +260 total
clearly improved chemistry and new guys understanding one of the most complex offenses in the league in year 2 cannot be understated. Just look at Mike Conley and the entire flow of the offense.  Also having D Fav backing up Rudy instead of a league average 12th man is a huge piece depth wise
"Mitchell found his stride after a few games of a slow start, going on a run of really stellar shooting/scoring along nice rebounding and assists numbers (the latter especially for Snyder's system), but Mike been great from the get-go this season, high efficience scoring, great defender and a proper floor general. With Rudy early struggles with his finishing (seems better these last games) and overall free throw shooting, even being as dominant as he can be on defense, and the screening and gravity piece he's on offense (which is a big part of how great we're shooting rn), there could be an argument that Conley been our best player so far."
"I vote based on how well a player is playing and how much i think they deserve it and how impactful their play is... I dont vote for box office players just because theyre box office players. my list this year west: mike conley, steph curry, bron, AD, Rudy gobert.   east:  jaylen brown, harden, KD, Embiid, randle"
"You vote for the 5 players you think are most deserving in the East, the 4 players you think are most deserving in tbe West, and Mike Conley."
Woj: Multiple sources report that thousands of Utah Jazz fans call for a recount of the All Star Vote stating missing ballots for Jazz Guard Mike Conley
"mike conley is, quite frankly, a god amongst men."
"Utah Jazz general manager Justin Zanik proudly waited outside the locker room after the final buzzer to give Rudy Gobert and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Friday evening. Injured guard Donovan Mitchell yelled out, “Aight. That's it.” Sharpshooter Bojan Bogdanović gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Mike Conley yelled out, “We got a [expletive] squad now.” And before Gobert hit the locker room door, former NBA great Carlos Boozer hugged him and said, “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.”"
MIKE CONLEY REDEMPTION ARC HAS PEAKED LETS GOOO
"I figure Memphis is gonna be voting for Mike anyways.   Assuming we're voting for Conley + Donovan &amp; Gobert, locking Randle in that leaves the following slots available:  West frontcourt - 2 slots     East guards - 2 slots     East frontcourt - 2 slots   We open for business, baby."
Mike Conley has never had a technical foul. After seeing Lowry thrown out today that still just blows my mind
Things that are inevitable:    1. Death     2. Taxes     3. Mike Conley getting 20+ in RPM

"I mean, Utah is on a 10-game win streak. They definitely leveled up this year (largely due to Conley playing like Memphis Mike)"
Mike Conley doubters need to watch this game. He’s been a fucking engine.
Mike Conley leads the league in +/- and has an on/off rating of +29  Also Caruso leading the league in 3P%
Jrue Holiday and Mike Conley for co-MUPs of the year
Must be a Mike Conley alt
"I don't think it's too flawed. I think fans have historically put too much weight into the All-Star game when discussing careers, which has caused athletes to care about it like Conley does.  In reality, it's meant to be a rest weekend for 90% of the league while a select few get brand exposure and help get more eyes on basketball.  Russell Westbrook or Chris Paul are just more exciting All-Star game players than Mike Conley would ever be. They draw in more eyes with their name value, too. So when one of them missed like 15 games in a 50-game stretch, people would complain ""he's missed X% of the season! Conley's Grizzlies are the 5 seed and the Clippers are the 6 seed right now!"", it was actually they who missed the point of the game."
"GameStop, Dogecoin, and Mike Conley.  SEND THEM TO THE MOON, GENTS."
"Sorry, not an all star. Mike Conley deserves to be in the hall of very good"
Mike conley #nbaallstar
"East forward depth:  Starters: KD, Giannis  Reserves: Tatum, ???  Positionless nominee: ???  Candidates: Hayward, Middleton, Harris  Hayward: 23.6/5.2/3.6 on .510/.427/.857 - 5.2 3PA  Middleton: 21.9/6.5/5.8 on .519/.441/.925 - 6.0 3PA  Harris: 20.1/6.7/2.8 on .525/.461/.821 - 4.8 3PA  I think Middleton gets in as a reserve so it becomes an argument of Harris vs Hayward.  I can't speak for either's defense. Hayward is averaging more points on weaker efficiency but Tobi is averaging less points on better efficiency on the better team.  There's an argument for either, but if Tobi gets snubbed then we can continue giving him the Mike Conley treatment and that's worth it for the memes alone."
Tbh I am more impressed on your research than mike conley jr. Lol
the point is judging players up to this point in the year  we are 18 games into the season and mike conley is clearly an all star  you can be upset but thats big time facts
"Mike Conley is the starting point guard of the best team in the West, I honestly believe that he should be selected to the team, or should be the first injury replacement in line"
Have you considered Mike Conley though?
"I think you're overlooking Mike Conley, you should probably take a look at his play this year."
Mike Conley  Mike Conley  Mike Conley  Mike Conley  Mike Conley
"As it stands, he's always going to be on that list of ""best players to never make an All-Star team.""  If he makes an All-Star Team, Mike Conley is a name that never comes up again outside of Memphis after he retires."
So we have a Mike Conley and Alex Caruso back court
Embiid and Booker getting replaced by Mike Conley made a huge difference in the disparity as well
"For those who, like me, wanted to see this also in comments, here's the point breakdown:   Mike Conley with 27 points in the final round.  Jayson Tatum with 17 points in the final round.  Steph Curry with 28 points in the final round"
"The Clippers are making moves to try to get someone who can stop Mike Conley. Dude is an absolute animal, and Kyle Lowry won’t be helping when it comes to playoff defense. Say your prayers LA because the True Kings of the North are coming 😈"
"The day after the draft in 2007, right after Mike Conley Jr.’s introductory press conference, I saw Mike at Hooters in downtown Memphis looking like a middle school kid with fake facial hair. And I thought then, “this kid makes me feel old.”   Then I see this tweet today."
that's what i'm saying. last year it was players like buddy hield and joe harris. everyone knows how good they are at shooting. but i personally had no idea that mike conley was like that.
Why did Mike Conley look so sad :(((
Mike Conley completely wasted a spot wow. 3 points. Worst all star of all time

"&gt;KD joined a premade championship team that only lost 9 games the previous season.  ""Warriors only won first team because Mike Conley, Kevin Love, and Kyrie got hurt.

Give it to Mike Conley

Damn mike Conley !
"If 't be true mike conley wins this i'll did shed drops of sorrow of joy  ***    ^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)  Commands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`"
If Mike Conley wins this I'll shed tears of joy
MIKE CONLEY
Fuck yeah mike conley
I keep forgetting Mike Conley isn't on the Grizzlies anymore
Mike Conley is so likeable
MIKE CONLEY!!!  Also was the scoreboard being weird for anyone else?
Mike fucking Conley let’s go baby!
MIKE CONLEY IS JUST NICE LIKE THAT
Mike Conley 🔥🔥
MIKE CONLEY IS REALLY GOOD
"Remember when Mike Conley Jr. was called Mike Conley Unior coming out of college, because he couldn’t shoot?"
WHAT THE FUCK MIKE CONLEY
PUT SOME GOD DAMN RESPECT ON MIKE CONLEY R/NBA. FUCK YALL
ALL STAR MIKE CONLEY
Oh god mike Conley does not have a pretty release
Mike Conley is the nba version of brucie from the longest yard for this weekend
I'm glad Mike Conley gets his all star appearance
Would Mike Conley make an All-NBA wholesome team?
Need Conley Szn to begin now. Come on Mike
Mike Conley big money let’s go 🤞
"Kenny's in that tier of good players who weren't All-Stars. For now, I'm gonna call them the Lamar Odom All-Stars. Mike Conley All-Stars might still work better though. Two guys needed to be injured before he got in. For the record, I've liked Conley since he was playing for Ohio State and I really thought the Jazz would make a leap when they got him. It just happened a year later."
Give both spots to Mike Conley
Mike Conley Jr.
I’m not taking it that seriously lol I like mike Conley but he’s nowhere near dirk or Kobe
"Mike conley getting elbowed in the face by McCollum in the first round of the playoffs. We still won that series in 5, although it probably would’ve been a sweep otherwise. However without Conley we lost game 1 of the second round to the warriors. Once he returned we won the next 2 straight before losing the series in 6.   So I’ve always wondered what would have happened in that game 1 if Conley were healthy, and presumably we swept the Blazers in the first round. Do we pull of the upset in game 1? If so do we still win games 2 and 3? If so then it starts to skew towards us knocking off the warriors before their dynasty even began.   Even outside of the grizzlies that could have changed the entire nba landscape over the next 5 years."
Mike Conley.   Still good enough to be a huge impact on a winning team + gimmiedaloot!
"Honestly my answer to this even if there weren't the star/superstar restriction would be Mike Conley. Normal height, not super recognizable in public, 200M+ in career earnings."
I guess I just think players hold on to the “star” label longer than y’all. He wasn’t Mike Conley bad from last year and was injured a lot. And he went to the all star game in 17 and 18 and the team had lebron and kyrie
"yes, in the playoffs give me chris paul over mike conley"
"Bro I hate people arguing this Gobert over Jokic nonsense when Gobert also has 3 great perimeter defenders in Royce O'Neal, Joe Ingles, and Mike Conley. Also has an insane primary scorer in Donovan Mitchell, the best 3 point shooting team in the league, a player on pace to set the TS% record, a 6MOTY candidate, and is the 4th scorer on his team.   I was hard rooting for the Jazz because I liked their team design and wanted to see the West shaken up, but their Reddit fans are becoming intolerable. Yesterday I'm arguing with someone who thinks Gobert is a top 10 player, now I'm seeing Gobert over Jokic as if he single handedly guarantees a top 3 defense"
"Yeah I got a KAT jersey since he’s my favorite in the league, got a Tatum jersey, kawhi my all time favorite player so I got his Clippers jersey, lebron Lakers jersey, Grizzlies Mike Conley, Tatum jersey, Brooklyn harden jersey, Giannis jersey, and a Curry jersey. I really went through a jersey collection phase this last year lol"
"I'd definitely pick Mike Conley, he's such an unlikable guy /s"
"In the case of the Jazz, the biggest difference is Mike Conley returning to form after a long adjustment to a new team.  He wasn't used to playing off the ball last year, and didn't start to find his rhythm until March, when the season suddenly ended.  This year he's back to playing like a star, and that's a huge improvement for the team."
"McKinley Wright IV, from Colorado. 22 year-old senior point guard, at 6’0” and 196 pounds, he should have the size for the NBA- that’s roughly a Kyle Lowry type build. Wright was a great free throw shooter (84%) on one of the best free-throw shooting teams in the country. He only shot 30% from three, but the good free throw percentage and previous good three point shooting seasons suggest he should be fine in the NBA- even if three point shooting isn’t his bread and butter. He also had an assist to turnover ratio of 6:2, and really cut down on his turnovers this year. For a guy who’s floor seems to be solid backup guard and whose ceiling (IMO) is Grizzlies Mike Conley but slightly worse on defense, he’s getting surprisingly little buzz."

Don't forget all-star Mike Conley with 11 points in 35 minutes.
It was me.  It was because Mike Conley bitch slapped me for no reason.
Mike Conley keeps underperforming in big games.
Mike Conley .... All-star?
Mike Conley has certainly not been living up to his all star appearance.
That was leaving your man by Mike Conley
Mike Conley is 2-11 and I don't even notice. Guy's a smooth player
"mike conley has the kindest eyes ive ever seen. idk what it is about them but it's captivating.   and for that reason, I've decided that *if* we were to lose in the 1st/2nd round, utah will be my bandwagon"
"I disagree with 5 too, but its disrespectful to paint the narrative of that series as Jazz being “reverse swept” versus it truly just being a dead even coin flip series with a mike Conley down and out 3/final shot being the real decider on who moves on (and nuggs had home court).  I think it’s a coin flip/ 7 game series once again if you switch home court to the jazz, and both teams getting better"
"No it wasn’t. We were awful in the bubble. We didn’t have Bogey, and Mike Conley still wasn’t Mike Conley. Ingles is also playing like a different player this year, Royce has continued to improve, and Rudy’s gotten better as well. Last year was a huge adjustment for him getting used to not having a PF, and this year he’s figured it out and both he and our team defense are much better. It’s really just not the same team"
"Flip a coin, much like last time we faced.  Lot of ppl forget that entire playoff series was a Mike Conley down and out 3 from Jazz advancing instead.   These are two VERY even teams who both seemed to get better from last year"
"Technically, the big 3 of Marc Gasol, mike Conley and Zach Randolph accomplished more considering that they played more than 7 games together. It’s a bit too early to be saying goat"
Most overseas players but to name a college player it would be Mike Conley.
"The NBA has way higher AAV contacts though.  Bryce Harper is making less than Al Horford this year.  Trout, Lindor, and Cole make about the same as Paul George, Mike Conley, Kawhi Leonard and Tobias Harris.  I was really shocked when Bauer got $102 million over the next three years but that deal has two opt-outs and other crazy stuff."
"No order:  Stephen Curry  Chris Paul  John Wall   Russell Westbrook  Derrick Rose  Tony Parker  Kyrie Irving  Rajon Rondo  Kyle Lowry  Damian Lillard  Mike Conley, Isaiah Thomas and Kemba Walker are very close"
"Well we aren't beating any of the top 4. Which is the nets sixers bucks and heat. So yes we will be first round exits if we make the playoffs.  We don't have a floor general. U should know more than anyone how important floor generals like ja and conley are lol. We are just bad.  The only 2 times the bulls have ever been competitive for a championship in our history was thanks to the draft. Specifically when we got very high draft picks.  When we got Mike and scotty both top 5 picks, and rose at 1. Thanks to lottery we have 6 rings lol.  And thanks to free agency the best we've ever done is Boozer and a 34 year old gasol lol.  But oh yea lets aim for that 4 game sweep experience that is so helpful somehow lmao. Magic and vuc have gotten that experience recently, what did it do for them? Nothing  I'll never understand bulls fans delusion for wanting to get smashed in the first round so badly. U think big free agents are coming here? Lmao. Never in our history even when we were good have big free agents came here.  Drafting high in the draft is the only reason we have ever been championship contenders. Sorry for thinking its such a bad idea for wanting to go through a proven route that has literally garnered our entire franchise's success lmao.  The only reason grizzlies are even solid is because of high draft picks lol. Ja and JJJ when he comes back. U know how important high picks are first hand. Sorry for wanting the bulls to be actual contenders rather than first round exits?  Geez"
Gotta say Mike Conley has gotta be up there. Super handsome man with *the* best smile/teeth in the league.
"The Jazz are really good, and Mike Conley knows us inside and out. Really tough matchup for us."
"The correct answer is Mike Conley.   Jalen Brunson is up there, too."
Jrue Holiday and Mike Conley the most underrated players of all time if you look at the definition of underrated you see their pics.  So underrated
"&gt;I don’t know how people are finding this funny, if this were Patrick Beverly people would be saying off with his head.  It's because both these players have completely different reputations, and these reputations can influence how people perceive their actions.  For example, if Mike Conley were the one flipping Schroeder, would you still be surprised if the reaction were different?"
I think the Lakers would’ve beat the Nuggets but might wanna remind yourself how they even got to the WCF last year in the first place. They were a Mike Conley rim out from being eliminated by a injured Jazz team. Individual series can be misleading.

Mike Conley
Mike Conley on the other hand looked like the goat out there.
"If Mike Conley is complaining, I'm complaining.  That was bullshit."
"Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert, and some guys they found on the street outside the arena, I think"
has anyone said Mike Conley yet
Mike Conley Jr.
Thank God for Mike Conley
Mike Conley
Utah was able to trade Grayson Allen for Mike conley.  I'm sure GSW can figure out how to get something good for that minnesota pick + wiseman
"I think you can't underestimate a player's knowledge of the sets, plays, and tendencies of his former team.  So much of the game is about the speed of the game and if you have a leg up on anticipating the next play you have an advantage.  I'd be really curious if players play better against their former team on their own court.  Like for example does Mike Conley as a Jazz player shoot better playing in Memphis compared to other teams, do you think familiarity with a former gym makes a difference?"
"Then why you gotta beat us three times in a week, man?  JK. It was crazy watching Mike be clutch AGAINST us for once, though! Rooting for my boy Conley to get a ring this year."
"Yessir... Him and KD came into the same Freshman class. I felt like if he stayed one more season he would’ve been a borderline seasonal all-star similar to Mike Conley. But he’s had a long career so, I’m proud for him"
Mike Conley is playing like Mike Conley again. Mitchell has raised his game yet again. Bojan is back from injury. Gobert is playing the best season of his career. Joe Ingles is leading the league in TS%. Jordan Clarkson has become an automatic bucket off the bench. Gobert’s backup minutes are going to Derrick Favors instead of Tony Bradley.  Plus we were already the best 3pt shooting team in the league last year and simply decided to turn that up to 11.  We’re really just firing on all cylinders at every position this season... except our 3rd stringers. They’ve turned many 30 points blowouts into 15 point wins this season.
When tf did people start hating on Mike Conley? He's like the nicest guy in the league haha
"He’s not over 30, first off.   Secondly, max contracts change year to year, so you can’t use the actual numbers as comparison. That’s not how it works.  Anyway...  Chris Paul got a max over 30. Dame Lillard got a **supermax** at 30. Klay Thompson got a max at 30. Kyle Lowry got a max at 30.  If we bump it down to just one year younger...  Westbrook got a **supermax** at 29. John Wall got a **supermax** at 29. Kemba got a max at 29. Steph Curry got a max at 29. Jimmy Butler got a max at 29. Mike Conley got a max at 29.  Should I keep going?"
Mike Conley is literally getting paid $34 million this year what are any of you talking about?  They're both massively overpaid.
What’s with the double standard of not calling Jrue good enough to be an all star but also calling Mike Conley an all star when Jrue is similar offensively and way better defensively?
This comment lead me to discover that Mike Conley and Mitchell Donavon both have a career .5493 TS percentage.
Mike Conley with the assist
"He's really like the perfect PG to pair with Luka.  He'd probably not be nearly as effective as the primary facilitator, but as the secondary ball handler behind Luka they really compliment each other.   I could see him having a Mike Conley type of steady career."
Mike Conley is so nice he made a ref rescind a tech and apologize.
As good and important as Mike Conley was in Memphis when he was at his peak.
"Yea we've been hearing this forever.  ""Mike Conley would absolutely be an all star if the competition for the spot weren’t steph/dame/CP3/Kobe/Tony Parker""  ^ That's actually the guards from the 2013-14 ASG. Seems wild that more than half were in the original example"
"We can debate whether SGA is better than Murray at this very moment, but I'd place bets on Shai passing him before Murray gets a real shot at an All-Star or All NBA team.  Murray, to me, looks like the 2020's version of Mike Conley or Andre Miller. Really solid/good player who just can't crack the upper-most echelon of his peers. Barring unforeseen injuries, the list of talent is only going to continue to grow. Besides CP3 and arguably Steph, none of these dudes is going to fall off before Murray's prime has come and gone."
Mike Conley is the 3rd best player but he's the 2nd option
He arguably deserved the all-star nod over CP3 and definitely over Mike Conley. Mike Conley probably should have gotten a nod earlier in his career but not this year.
Mike Conley
Mike Conley
Mike Conley
Wonder what the market will be like for Mike Conley and if the Jazz will be able to keep him
Mike Conley added that a human can go on living for 6 hours without a head.

"I'm not bashing korver let me clear that. I know he is good and a coveted specialist he deserves it that yr. My point is he saying Lillard doesn't have an Allstar team mate is nonsense cause not everyone can be an Allstar despite being a very good player. Let's say Mike Conley, he became an Allstar just now. Same for Jalen brown. McCollum is not an Allstar but we know he is a very good player."
"Battled with one of the best teams in the NBA. Can only blame ourselves for not converting layups and free throws down the stretch. Because in the last five minutes, Mike Conley will command the court with surgical precision.   GG Jazz."
I just like Mike Conley :-)
i would also like to pander upvotes  but i do love mike conley jr though
Memphis Fans 🤝 Utah Fans  &gt; Mike Conley Jr
"With Donovan out, hopefully Bogey and JC can find their rhythm and Conley can bring himself to play well against his beloved Grizzlies. Is Memphis allowing fans in the arena to cheer for Mike?"
"My likely projection for Haliburton is something along the lines of a better version of Malcolm Brogdon. They've similar players, but Tyrese is better at 20 years old than Brogdon was at 25.  Another comp I really like was Mike Conley combined with Doug Christie"
Their point is Mike Conley.
"My Grizz would be fun  PG Mike Conley, Ja Morant,  Jason Williams SG Tony Allen, Mike Miller, Bonzi Wells SF Rudy Gay, Shane Battier, James Posey PF Pau Gasol, Zbo, Shareef Abdur-Rahim C Marc Gasol, Jaren Jackson Jr, Big Country Reeves"
"I love Ja, but it’s definitely Mike, Allan/battier/Miller , Zbo, Marc, Gay.   If primes don’t matter Lowry/Conley, iverson , battier/Vince carter, Zbo, Marc/pau"
Grizzlies would be pretty solid too. It’s either Ja Morant/Mike Conley/Jason Williams SG Tony Allen SF Rudy Gay PF Pau Gasol/ZBO C Marc Gasol
"Mike Conley, CP3, Jrue Holiday, Goran Dragic. I'd rather have these guys than pay Dennis 20M+/year"
"Plenty of PGs potentially available if you want to overpay and if jrue or cp3 opt out. I’d expect jrue to opt in and cp3 to opt out if the suns have middling playoff success. You can grab Lonzo if you’re willing to overpay, mike Conley, shroeder or Kyle Lowry. If we see cp3 opt out pg is the only position imo where people have a couple options that aren’t shit. Couple shooting guards available to but the rest of it is pretty shit."
"Not at all - Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Lonzo Ball, we can throw 2 year/40 million deals and see what happens."
"If he does get bought out (which I doubt), he'd be a good 3rd center for the Jazz. He could end his career with Mike Conley, chasing a ring in the unlikeliest of locations."
"Jesus, between him and Lonzo the market this summer for a PGs is going to be fucked. CP3, mike Conley and Kyle Lowry all can be free agents too if cp3 opts out."
"Mike Conley with more touches(playing some of the best basketball of his season), Bojan more touches, Royce more touches, Ingles more touches. Yes, we would be around the 4-6 seed without Mitchell rn."
Mike Conley did this when he went to the Jazz. He started like his first few games shooting sub 30% lol
When's the last time Mike Conley has made a floater??
"Look, if you are just trying not to jinx it for your team I understand, but dude:  &amp;nbsp;  \+  **Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (17-29) | [](/UTA)Jazz (34-11) ---|---  D.

Mike Conley should get an honorable mention. Guy's impressive.
Why is that pathetic? It's entertainment.   I immediately became a Sun's fan when Chris Paul got there. I'm a Jazz fan because Mike Conley is there.
Maybe that 2007 season he shot 43.8 from 3? But it'd be close and probably only as an injury replacement.  That season he was roughly what Mike Conley is for Utah this year. Very similar stats. And Conley was a fringe All Star that got in mostly due to team record I think.
"They are not star-power-dependent. They have 6-7 players who can score. Bojan Gogdanovic can shine, Mike Conley."
Borderline all-star is Mike Conley. Mitchell is a legit star in this league even prior that said duel
"Borderline all star is what Mike Conley was labeled his entire career, because he was always a borderline all star."
"I feel like Fox, Shai or Demar should have been in the game prover Mike Conley and they only put him in there bc he has never been. and I said Kings PLAYERS get no love the team doesn't deserve love but Buddy, Fox and Haliburton definitely deserve their credit, bc if you think players don't deserve credit for doing really good but having a bad team Bradley Beal, Christian Wood, KAT, Lavine, Brandon Ingram and Zion should get no love either."
"You say this, but look what Memphis got for a younger Mike Conley"
"Yes it's mostly LeBron fans.  1) warriors suck they only won that first ring because Kyrie and Mike Conley got hurt. They are Soooo overrated.   2) warriors suck, they lost to the cavs in the finals and they should have lost to the Thunder, but KD choked. Warriors not really good. They shouldn't have made the finals, but KD choked hahaha   3) wait wait wait, KD joined the greatest team in nba history. I know I just said they suck, but they don't because now they will beat LeBron. And we know LeBron has nothing but scrubs on that cavs team. Grrrr  They contradict themselves all the time. The Nets thing is even more hilarious with all the stuff we previously mentioned."

"**Indiana Pacers**:      The Jazz fanbase gets along really with the Pacers fans, as both are small market franchises that have been near perennial playoff teams for the last 30 years. We don't really get media hype when we play well and generally both finish around the 4-5-6 seed range. Myles Turner and Rudy Gobert are also both two of the leagues outright best defenders and our team success is largely attributed to the impact those two have. We both consider each other to be Jazz East and Pacers West.      **Memphis Grizzlies**.        The Jazz fanbase gets along really with the Grizzlies fans too. The common link shared is that we have primarily been built around a great defensive identity, as well as a shared love for Mike Conley (who should make an All-Star team this year). The Conley trade was mutually beneficial for both teams and so they've always been chill with each other for that reason. Morant and Mitchell are also young high flying phenomenons and the future of our respective teams."
"&gt;This is factually incorrect as Kyrie Irving was not a max contract player in 2018, he had a salary of $18.8M (**half** of what Kemba is due to earn next year!).   Maybe you should read up on how the salary cap works. Kyrie's contract was a max extension at the time that he signed it. He was on a max contract. The value of a max contract changes year to year and based on experience. For example, Steph Curry makes $43M, so is Kemba not on a max deal?   &gt;And even if you think they ever had a chance of beating Lebron, if they made the finals they were going to lose to the Warriors in 5 games.  They were not at all legitimate contenders that year.   They definitely had a chance of beating Lebron. They were up 3-2 and were in the lead in the 4th quarter of game 7.   And being in the finals makes you a contender. People could have said that the raptors weren't really contenders. Then KD and Klay went down and look what happened.    &gt;I am telling you, it is completely unprecedented and a ridiculous concept for a team to be a **real** contender when you have a bad max contract.   Kevin Love - 9 pts, 7 rebs in the finals - 15 pts, 6 rebs in ECF with very bad defence = nba champion   Michael Finley - 2006 Mavs - 4th highest paid player in the NBA, didn't play   Keith Van Horn - 2006 Mavs - 14th highest paid player in the NBA, played 12mpg   David Lee - 2015 Warriors, highest paid player on 25% of salary cap, played 8mpg in the playoffs   Larry Hughes - 2007 Cavs averaged 11ppg in the playoffs, paid 25% of the cap   Patrick Ewing 1999 - highest paid player in the NBA, injured for the playoffs, knicks made the finals   I'm not going to keep going back but I've proven my point.   20, 4 &amp; 5 of decent efficiency is not bad relative to the examples above. Its not what you hope for from a max contract but its a nice player.   By this logic Mike Conley and Tobias Harris are bad max contracts, too. And they are on the two 1 seeds."
Get Mike Conley in there too.
"Kristaps Porzingis   OG Anunoby   Khris Middleton   Kyle Lowry  Mike Conley   Bench:   Joe Ingles, Thad Young, Rudy Gay, Danillo Gallinari, Maxi Kleber, Chris Boucher, Derrick Rose   Would this team win 60 games? Idk but it would win alot"
I'm here to say that Mike Conley has one of the dopest jackets I've ever seen
Kinda miss Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley
"Mike Conley figured out his role in their system, Bogey is healthy, Favors is a major upgrade over their old backup centers, Clarkson is having the best season of his year by a huge margin, Ingles looks more comfortable taking shots, Gobert is playing better than ever before and they've generally been healthier than most other teams.  They also just got an extra year of reps with the same core and practice makes perfect.  Snyder retooled their offensive scheme to get even more open threes during the break before the bubble and they've really got it going at this point."
Mike Conley dressed like a white dude from a hood movie that gets bullied by everyone
"For I, the early 2010's Memphis Grizzlies Grit and Grind era with Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, Mike Conley and Tony Allen was a throwback to the 1990's New York Knicks and Miami Heat era in the NBA's Eastern Conference. Play good, tough and aggressive defense, and not score more then ninety five was their ultimate goal."
Celtics superstar Mike Conley.
the mike conley memorial award.
The new Mike Conley?
"The non Gobert Jazz defense ratings are all confounded by the fact that we go from all-time defensively with gobert on the court, to below average without him. Like Mike Conley is a good defender, but a lot of impact stats have him near the top 10 because he plays so many minutes with Gobert.  The suns perimeter defenders are significantly better than the Jazz's. CP3 and Bridges with Gobert behind them would be one of the best defenses in NBA history."
Historically: Andre Miller  Current: Mike Conley
yea it's pretty unreliable. When you got Jamal Murray Joe Harris Mike Conley top 15 but Dort LeBron Anunoby Butler and Draymond are not even top 30 it's definitely a joke. Probably at least has half of the players wrong but at least it's right having Gobert the clear #1   And Jokic has a higher DRPM than AD lol
mike conley is a mickey mouse all star
"Ah yes, notable Lakers players, Mike Conley and Donovan Mitchell. what the fuck was mdgt\_pope getting at there?"
I love Mike Conley but Ricky will always be a Jazzman in my heart
Mike Conley will probably be forgotten.
Kevin Love   Bradley Beal   Domantas Sabonis   Nikola Vucevic   Al Horford   Paul Millsap   LaMarcus Aldridge   Mike Conley   Khris Middleton   DeMarcus Cousins   CJ McCollum
"Maybe outside Memphis, but Grizzlies fans aren’t forgetting about Mike Conley any time soon."
Mike Conley
i think this era is so packed with guards that can shoot i wouldnt be surprised if (and a pains me to say this bc i love this man) a Bradley Beal or Mike Conley or (insert above average guard that hasnt won here)  dont get me wrong i love Beal. i think hes easily top 2 or 3 at his position. injuries havent been kind to Bradley
"Going by this year’s All-Star game:   - Zach LaVine - Nikola Vucevic - Domantas Sabonis - Mike Conley Jr.  My hottest take is that **Paul George** is going to be forgotten in the future, at least how good he was."
"It's starting to look like the Jazz are either going to match up with the Lakers or the Warriors in round 1... and I can't imagine they feel too great about that. You gotta hope that Mike Conley can come back and go straight Memphis mode on defense and do *eeeeeeverything* he can to slow Steph down, because Steph, next to Draymond, is one of the only guys in the league that *will* beat you by himself if you let him.  Ultimately though, the Jazz have been the best team in basketball all year, so I can't draw too much away from them. All I'm saying is that I wouldn't want to be in that subreddit if they lose game 1.  If I owned the Jazz, I'd be putting on my tin foil hat and building a legal case against Adam Silver, who seems to be retaliating against Rudy for shutting down last season with some cruel and unusual punishment. ""Congrats on having the best record in the NBA -- here's Steph."" How cruel."
"I mean, no Mike Conley or Mitchell and it went down to the last possession despite a Steph 35-point game. Probably wouldn't be close once those two are back."
"Mike Conley, better."
"Yeah but this is a problem in basketball discourse, most talented player isn't necessarily best player.   KD was absolutely the most talented player on those Warriors teams, but that doesn't mean he was the best player.  The best player on a team is the most important player, the one that the team can't stomach their loss or they drastically suffer in terms of W/L record, the player that impacts winning the most. There was never a point in time where DeMar DeRozan was better than Kyle Lowry despite being more talented and putting up superior stats. There was never a point in time where Blake Griffin was better than Chris Paul despite being more talented and putting up superior stats, similar story with Devin Booker this year. Donovan Mitchell is not better than Mike Conley this season, despite being more talented and putting up superior stats.   KD has never impacted wins/losses as much as his reputation has suggested he has, the reason why nobody ever talks about it, is his most glaring weakness (playmaking and creating for others on offense) has been covered up by the fact that he's played with an MVP point guard for the entirety of his career who has fulfilled that role."
Mike Conley last season
"Raptor rates Mike Conley and Rudy Gobert as top 5 players in impact, and Clint Capela as better than LeBron and KD. Obviously, if all advanced metrics point to a player being really good then he probably is (Gobert) I just think they don't mean much beyond that"
Mike Conley is left out.
hope the clippers collapse and kwahi doesnt take his PO. Sign Kwahi. honestly this free agent class looks like shit. maybe mike conley?
Because people's histories effect how we perceive their actions.  If Mike Conley or Jrue Holiday did this nobody would be debating if it was dirty either.
"They can't win a championship because they don't have the starpower. They would not have the best player against the Lakers, Clippers, Nuggets, Sixers, Bucks, or Nets. They wouldn't even have one of the top two players against a lot of those teams. You aren't gonna Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley iso or pick and roll/hand off your way to the championship."
"You’re right, replacement level isn’t the right word, average is probably more accurate.  And I’ll point out that on/off stats are very tricky. Admittedly, I only used Russ’s from this year because they continued the general trend I was pointing out in my comment, but there are plenty of confounding factors that skew the results(see Mike Conley being the MVP). If say, somebody played alongside one of the best rebounders of recent history, that would affect things quite a bit(I don’t think even the most rabid Russ fans would suggest he’s actually worth +8 off reb %). There are two ways you could get around this problem.  -	You could look at games at which Russ missed and compare team rebounding then, which would completely eliminate the lineup problem, but you’d be working with small sample sizes -	Or, you could look at his ridge regressed rebound rate, which adjusts for contextual lineup data([explainer if you’re unfamiliar with it ](https://squared2020.com/2017/09/18/deep-dive-on-regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-i-introductory-example/)  From the first approach [when Russ hasn’t played this year, the team grabbed 48.79 rebounds per 100](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy/nba?0Exactly1DidNotPlayInGame=201566&amp;TeamId=1610612764&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;Type=Team), [and when he has played, they’ve grabbed 47.31](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy/nba?0Exactly1PlayedInGame=201566&amp;TeamId=1610612764&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;Type=Team). That’s not what you’d expect from a great rebounder. Again though, that’s only with a sample size of 7 games(I would try to get the same numbers from OKC and HOU but the query is so large pbp just fails to get results), so I’m guessing you don’t find it especially persuasive.   The better approach is to just use the ridge regressed rate, it combines all the plus minus numbers from the last 5 years and adjusts for contextual lineup data to get an estimate of his actual rebounding ability, without all the variance of on/off data. By this measure, he ranks [310th in the league](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm5?id=1417219936), a very slight positive(and I’ll admit, above replacement level). Amusingly, Steven Adams ranks #1. Crazy how that works.   I will cede though, using a single year of raw team on/off data as a knock against Russ was unfair of me. From [2011-2016](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm5?id=989835881), he was the 13th best offensive rebounder in the league(for a guard!), so I’m not trying to say he’s never been great. I do think though, that at this present moment, his stats are inflated quite a bit and he’s no longer the transcendent rebounder that many claim he is."
in that case they should give it to chris paul and mike conley or donovan mitchell instead of the guys on 5th and 6th seed. that'd be fine with me.
"You say that, but I might like him more than Suggs for the pistons. Suggs is a sure commodity but I don’t know that he’s a superstar. Feels like a Mike Conley kind a guy at best, good at everything, nice to have, but not the superstar that’s bringing you a championship. Mobley could be a Gobert like Defender who can handle the ball and make plays on offense, and shoot some. That’s tantalizing. It’s not always bad to take a home run swing when your rebuilding."
"The Clippers have never made the conference finals in their entire franchise history. PG has spent the last 4-5 years shitting his pants every playoffs with extreme consistency. They blew a 3-1 lead last year, to the same team the Jazz blew a 3-1 lead to one round earlier.  I don’t understand how anybody’s bar for “proven playoff success” or whatever today’s buzzword is could be high enough to exclude Chris Paul and Mike Conley and a guy who looked like Jesus Christ as a baller just last year, but low enough that Kawhi and I guess Ibaka alone can carry a poverty franchise with consistent individual failures to “proven” status."
"Its individual plus/minus and wins above replacement.  Its fine to use it as part of an argument (which tbf the op is doing) but not reliable by itself.  For example, that would lead one to believe that Mike Conley is a more valuable player than Steph, Giannis, and Lebron.   Its also not good at penalizing players that are only heavily involved on one end - for instance Gobert's overall rating is only slightly worse than his defensive rating.     Personally I think you can make an argument for any of Steph, Jokic, Giannis, and Embiid for MVP this year depending on what you value the most.     Obviously im biased but I like Giannis for it because of how impactful on both ends.   But I also agree that Jokic has a very strong argument and is almost a lock in to win it.  I absolutely won't view it as a bad choice or a robbing - he's earned it for sure."
"&gt; but this is the same dude who said don’t count another man’s bread, yet he’s in the bakery daily.  This doesn’t even make sense though. He said don’t count another man’s bread in response to someone on Twitter saying Mike Conley shouldn’t make more than him. He’s saying you shouldn’t be concerned over how much money someone else makes.   That has nothing to do with his comments about loyalty."
"Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley, Andre Iguadola, basically if you were a 2nd or 3rd option floor general and plus defender that wasn't a real rim protector that didn't rack up stats or accolades people are gonna look at you later like a bum."
RPM is utter garbage. Any stat that throws up as many nonsensical anomalies as that does isn't worth the paper it is written on. Can you honestly tell me Lonzo Ball is the 10th best player in the league? That Mike Conley is the 11th best and Devonte Graham rounds out the top 15? You need to reevaluate your methodology if that's what your metric is telling you...
"Mike Conley in fourth place, in 538’s custom measure.  He’s Chris Paul but without the media coverage."
Very nice list and concept.    I like Mike Bibby more for the never all star now that Conley became one
something to cinsider is that all star players are not all created equal  and some not all star players are extremely valuable  mo williams in 2009 was not what people think as all star for exanple  mike conley in the grizzlies was never one yet he was much more of a star
"&gt;Roster construction doesn't determine the effort they are willing to put into the game when it's being played. THAT falls onto the head coach.  A great coach will build his system around his players, not expect to fit his players into a system.   The Jazz got very lucky with Donovan Mitchell, and to a lesser extent Rudy Gobert, but outside of that Quin Snyder has turned the Jazz into a group 10x the sum of their parts. If you track it from George Hill, to Ricky Rubio, and then Mike Conley the Jazz essentially traded 5 first round picks to finally land a fit with Conley. That leaves us filling our roster with undrafted or unwanted players. Ingles, O'Neale, Niang, Ilyasova, Forrest, Oni, are all playing great basketball and it should all be to Snyder's credit. Clarkson is playing the best basketball of his career because Snyder built a system to take advantage of his talent.  Stevens is a good coach, but he's had this golden boy status for a few years and I never felt like he deserved it. I've always been a bit jealous and salty over Steven's rep because I've always felt Snyder is a better coach and underappreciated."
“Russel Westbrook is not having a good year lol.”  LOL  “Any NBA GM would take a player like Mike Conley 100% over Russ.”  LMFAO 🤣
Mike Conley
Mike Conley
"Mike Conley this year. Drafted in 2007, first all-star in 2021."
"Mike Conley? Drafted in 2007, first all star in 2021."
"I know you're already at a conversational disadvantage due to your condition, but let me try to help you with this math one more time.  4 games in a row is a sweep.  Utah won 3 out of the first 4 games.  You with me so far?  Now, the 1 game Utah lost, was a close game, and 1 in which Mike Conley didn't play.  You still with me?  Now, if Mike Conley had played, it's likely the Jazz would have won that game and now the 1 Denver win becomes a Jazz win.  That's 4 games in a row for the Jazz = Sweep."
"I think Conley is flying a little under the radar especially the last month or so due to injuries but the first half of the season, Mountain Mike was the reason for the impeccable Jazz win streaks. Donovan was mad inefficient and Conley was playing like the best guard in the west not named Chris Paul"
"I get you but I haven’t made any of those strawman arguments in my replies. Just simply refuting this notion that he is one dimensional. FYI I’m a curry hater and I don’t rank him top 1 or 2 in PG all time. I couldn’t stand the guy saying he’s one dimensional is all.  I rest my case lol what I can request is you reevaluate how you assess passing or rebounding in general. Melo isn’t an elite rebounder but he is not an “average rebounder”. Fans standards are usually skewed against star players or hall of famers. There are 280 plus other players in the league with way “worse” skill sets. But these guys that u call bums/below average are actually elite compared to an average joe. You don’t get to be elite with very glaring weaknesses. I would argue that in your assessment, your definition of above average passing comes from borderline top all stars or mvp candidates. Rubio is an elite passer he is not above average. He is able to orchestrate an offense even as a sub 40% non scorer/shooter. Above average passers are someone like Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton, Draymond (his bball iq and timing make him an elite playmaker but he’s still an above average passer, similar to Steph) and the like."
Mike conley
"Ya, but Mike Conley was out for the first 2 games also due to quarantine. Jazz very well could have swept the Nuggets last year even without Bogdanovic."
luckily nobody really cares what you believe about mike conley
That's NBA All-Star Mike Conley
"Forreal, there’s a huge difference between Mike Conley and Ricky Rubio"
"I think you hit the nail on the head with the talented vs more important point. Lots of commentators are really into the idea of talent, and enamored of players who can score at will, carry huge offensive loads, play good 1-on-1 defense, etc. And while that ""alpha male"" mentality is easy to get caught up in, at the end of the day the aim of the sport is to win games. And whatever you do to win games, no matter what it is, should make you a better basketball player.  That's why I wholeheartedly supported Mike Conley getting an All-Star nod. People said there were many more talented players, that his scoring numbers were unimpressive, that he relied on teammates' talent. Who gives a shit? If Mike Conley wins the Utah Jazz basketball games, Mike Conley is a good basketball player. Period."
"Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving vs Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley.  Brooklyn in 4."
"Yeah another thing I noticed was that he said, “We’re going to miss you,” and then went a step further and said, “*I* am going to miss you.” So genuine and heartfelt.  There are a handful of other NBA players I think are like this to an extent but probably none quite like Giannis. Steph Curry, Dwayne Wade, Kyle Korver, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Norm Powell"
And a small faction of us have our eyes on a man named Mike Conley *evil laughter*
the jazz arent playing donovan mitchell or mike conley jr until the playoffs  we're gobert and bojan men now
"&gt;borderline All-Star as league MVP.  You shut your mouth, Mike Conley still my MVP!"
"nah you dont wanna know how far id really go, I wouldn't trade Mike Conley for the man, not that hes a better player or anything  see you take a player like Steph curry and literally every team in the league would jump at the opportunity to have him on the squad even if they already had 10 point guards rostered and the same goes for a number of these other players but I feel like it doesn't apply to Westbrook  sure he might be considered a better player individually because of the big stats or the mvp and there was a time when he was a killer but nobody wants that dude leading their team."
"&gt;Jazz  I know I'm a homer, but who on the Jazz team is unlikeable? Don gotta be one of the more likeable guys in the league... Add Jingling Joe, the Minivan, Rudy 'The Weeb who loves ducks"" Gobert, Bucket's O'neal, and Oscar winner and 2 time Teammate of the Year ""Mountain"" Mike Conley, and you have a likability stew."
As a Lakers fan and NBA fan in general I don’t think anyone would disagree that this would be the best bracket.   Personally I would rather face Nuggets rather than Clippers in the 1st round  We get Steph in the playoffs who probably puts up great numbers on the Jazz (shoutout Mike Conley)  Clippers v Mavs part 2  Clippers V Suns  Possible ‘Battle of LA’ WCF  Nets (who might not have Harden by than) v Celtics (who’s looking much better).  Bucks v Heat part 2  Hornets in playoffs  76ers v the freaking Knicks  Bucks vs Nets  76ers vs Nets   All for a finals with 2 truly battle tests opponent as there are no easy routes. Would be amazing to witness.
"Tbf y'all have Mike Conley which just automatically makes y'all off limits. We're just like any fanbase, we have toxic people lol but after the bubble i think we're numb to the idea of the play-in knocking us out of our earned spot."
Grizz are tough because we currently have players with the possibility to be on here but aren’t currently.  Also relatively new fan so could be missing some older players   PG - Conley SG - Mike Miller SF - Shane battier PF - ZBo C - Pau/Marc
"If you're known for complaining all the time every single time no matter the play, they're not going to give you the benefit of the doubt when you do something that is clearly tech worthy like throwing the ball across the court instead of giving it to a ref.  Mike Conley isn't getting that tech, but that's because Mike Conley isn't being a baby for 2 hours a night every time somebody tugs a single loose string on his jersey."
"Also for the Jazz Mike Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Bojan Bogdanović. They're not the very top players on the Jazz but they are extremely important to their jump to the top of the West."
"Idk. They're in the same boat as the Jazz to me. Are they really the best team in the league if the Clippers, Lakers, and Nuggets are all healthy? Jazz were the best team before Donovan went down with the ankle injury because they were healthy besides Mike Conley. Suns best 4 players have missed a combined 5 games. Arguably their 5th in Crowder has only missed 8 games and thats all recently.   Compare that to Murray being out for the year, AD being hobbled by an Achilles all year, LeBron missing 20 with his ankle, Kawhi missing time because of his foot, same with PG. I mean 2 of the Clippers day 1 starting 5 have missed basically 75% of the season.   I don't know what to make of the Suns team."
"Want and able are two very different things. Which all star is going to get traded? The only possible two are both on Chicago and that seems unlikely considering Chicago made big trades to build their current team.   You can maybe get Mike Conley. Seriously go through the last few years of all stars and tell me who you’re getting. Or better yet tell who is someone teams want to give up on? Baring some sort of trade demand, I don’t see it happening organically. You will end up with Kevin Love in a buyout."
The understanding was that Luka bagley jjj and ayton would be the top 4 then dallas would select either WCJ or bamba and then orlando was targeting young which is why Atlanta felt comfortable trading back to 5 because young would still be on the board (Bc mike Conley was still on Memphis) and they still get another pick
what are you talking about. There a bunch of solid FA options. We dont need to address a star this year as long as we build upon our success and guys like RJ and Randle improve stars will come to us   **2021 Free Agency**  * Kyle Lowry  * Mike Conley * CP3 (PO) * Kawhi Leonard(PO)   **2022 Free Agency**  * Zach Lavine * James Harden (PO) * Jimmy Butler (PO) * Bradley Beal(PO)
mike conley had a nice full one
With both Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley out it provably won't be that hard for Pheonix.
I'll throw out some crazy ones to get this going.      * Mike Conley- 3/70 to NYK (Team option/partially guaranteed 3rd year) * Serge Ibaka- 2/20 to the Spurs  * Lauri Markannen- 3/50 to Miami (I did say crazy)
"Marc Gasol, Tony Allen, Mike Conley made the all defense teams together for 2012-13 and anchored Grit and Grind.  Pacers, Spurs, Bulls have had some good defensive teams, too, in the 2011-2015 era, but I dont know if it got to a big 3. Pacers had Hibbert/George/?. Bulls had Noah /Butler/?. Spurs had Duncan and Kawhi."
"what's the opinion on tony allen, marc gasol and mike conley?"
"If its someone on another team, Mike Conley.  Dude has been solid for a long time and half the NBA fanbase doesn't even know who he is."
"He’s 14th in the league in potential assists. That’s higher than Mike Conley, Ja, and Steph Curry."
"G&amp;G Grizzlies will forever be my favorite basketball, but yea if you upgrade Jeff Green, Tayshaun Prince, or even Rudy Gay to Kawhi Leonard, I think you’ve got the recipe for a ring.  PG - Mike Conley SG - Tony Allen SF - Kawhi Leonard PF - Zach Randolph C - Marc Gasol  Geez. Hard to imagine many teams scoring +100 against that defensive starting lineup."
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4. Jakob Poeltl 5. Joel Embiid 6. Myles Turner 7. Mike Conley 8. Derrick White 9. Alex Caruso 10. Rudy Gay 11. Nicolas Batum 12. Luguentz Dort 13. Andre Drummond 14. Jae Crowder 15. Larry Nance Jr. 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Isaiah Stewart 18. Khem Birch 19. Raul Neto 20. Nerlens Noel  A few oddities (Gay, Drummond, Neto) but overall not that bad.  -  ---  -  And then here are the 20 players with the highest **BBall Index D-LEBRON** (min. 1,000 minutes):   1. Rudy Gobert 2. Myles Turner 3. Clint Capela 4. Robert Covington 5. Nerlens Noel 6. Matisse Thybulle 7. Jakob Poeltl 8. Alex Caruso 9. Larry Nance Jr. 10. Giannis Antetokounmpo 11. Brook Lopez 12. Draymond Green 13. Joel Embiid 14. Ben Simmons 15. Tobias Harris 16. Jae Crowder 17. Andre Drummond 18. Kent Bazemore 19. Nicolas Batum 20. Jimmy Butler  Actually a very solid list IMO, Drummond is the only guy there where I'm like *eehhhhh.....*"
"To be fair, Donovan Mitchell was out for both of the last two games against them, and Mike Conley was out for another. Turns out teams struggle when 1-2 of their best players is missing. Weird."
"2015 Tyreke Evans injured in first round, Mike Conley injured then returned and then injured Tony Allen in round 2, missed half season Dwight Howard in round 3, Kyrie and Love in finals is literally why the history will be skeptic to Curry through the years. His only KD-less success is one big asterisk not to mention subpar finals and his 2015 MVp is one of the worst statlines in mvp history"
Mike Conley
Mike Conley just made his first all star. Should he be MIP?
Mike Conley is devilishly handsome.
Okay so its not about fame its about basketball so we can put that aside.   Obviously Russel is better than Draymond I chose an extreme example. So you think it should be some combination of where they rank as overall players and where they rank as offensive options. I'm still not sure I get what the point of treating it this way instead of saying Draymond was a bigger driver of the Warriors success than Klay that you so he is the 2nd best player and 2nd banana.   I think a lot of 2nd bananas have been great defensive players. If you thought Donavon Mitchell was the best player on the Jazz would Mike Conley be the 2nd banana? That just seems odd to me. Is Tobias Harris the 2nd banana on the 6ers?
"It's the lefty thing. He's just like Mike Conley, probably actually right-handed but learned to shoot left-handed (mike conley actually thinks about switching to right-hand every off season lol). So it's ugly if he thinks while shooting, but if he lets muscle memory do it, he's golden."
"Yo we just lost Mike Conley  on top of Donovan and are prob gonna lose the one seed, less r/nba pump up/“look at us”, more humbleness head down grit and grind"
"I remember when Kyle was drafted and a year later, I was at the Grizzlies draft party where Kyle Lowry was the player host and saw his facial expression when it was announced the Grizzlies had drafted Mike Conley.  So if Kyle feels old...."
You fundamentally don't understand basketball if you think Rondo poses anywhere near the same kind of threat to the Mavs as a guy like Mike Conley.  Do both use PnRs?  Sure.  Are both good players?  Sure.  Do they attack the PnR the same way?  Absolutely not.  Try going under against a Conley PnR.  He's going to drain 3s all day.  That's simply not in Rondo's arsenal.  The Mavs are much better suited to defend any of the players you mentioned than they are to defend the Jazz.  The Jazz can specifically exploit KP's weaknesses in ways that those teams can't.
"What part of this is incorrect?  We all know Dwight definitely has some distance between his world and reality. Also evidenced by telling everyone he was going to try and evangelize in the NBA and convert a bunch of people to Christianity, followed by trying to fuck pornstars and then having a bunch of kids out of wedlock.   I liked Dwight early in his career for being a goofy dude that was bringing back the Center position.   But even back then Stan was telling him, don't block shit into the stands. This isn't college, these games are super important. Nobody is getting demoralized seeing their shot go into the 3rd row. They're happy they get to reset and run a play side out of bounds.   Then the whole Dwightmare situation, followed by refusing to work with and listen to Steve Nash and Kobe.   Followed by trying to be Hakeem in Houston without the requisite skills.   His last year with the Lakers was the one time where he said he was going to keep his head down, listen to the coach, listen to the vets, listen to LeBron and just fit in. And guess what? He played impactful minutes on a championship team.   He wasn't perfect and still had episodes of trying to do too much, but he got benched right away lol.   I feel for Dwight in the sense that I don't think Refs are being fair when it comes to bigs. You can push and shove and hack in the paint and nothing gets called OR worse, when someone like Dwight has Mike Conley behind him and tries to legally back him down Conley can flop and flail and then Dwight gets called for the offensive foul.   Meanwhile on the perimeter a fingernail grazes an arm hair and it's a foul.   Still, acting like he's been a shit-talking badass enforcer his whole career is lol. I really think he did something to the refs though. Because dude gets called for touch fouls on boxouts which nobody else does."
"&gt; There's nobody else even close.  Mike Conley literally got a shoutout in this article with this note:  &gt;His 0.182 defensive win shares, 99.7 DRtg better than teammate Gobert’s.  I agree with the rest, but I feel like Conley is a pretty good defender."
Could Mike Conley be a realistic future comp for Hali?
"Bogdanovic is not supposed to help on inbound pass he is help, that pass was too fast for him. Also it is not Mike's(he pointed at KAT for Gobert to stick with him) fault but Gobert's, Mike saw Gobert stuck so he hedged buying him time to recover Gobert didn't move so Conley instead of hedging out KAT and going back to DLo, then choose to stay with KAT and not leave open three, Gobert stopped inbound to Edwards(with slight dip in the key) then got stuck on screen and had brain fart, saw Mike ""switching"" Mike turned back slightly and Gobert was like ""oh shit that's my man"" so It is one of those situations where you miss timing to do something and you do it 1 sec later but it's even worse then."
"Conley didn't show switch he showed him to stay on KAT, but Gobert was stuck in the screen so he hedged KAT to force him out Gobert was on hedge supposed to recover and Mike to go back to his man/Russell, but Gobert got confused Mike saw he was not gonna recover and stayed on KAT, Rudy did worse thing hesitated and then went back to his man with Conley too far out to recover."

"""I remember him walking into our locker room and he walked right by me. And I’m like, what the hell is he coming in our locker room for? And he walked by me, walked by Rudy, and he tapped Donovan on the leg and he said, ‘Lace ‘em up, it’s gonna be a long fucking night."" - Mike Conley."
One dimensional offenses get exposed in the playoffs. Without Conley and a healthy Donovan the jazz are completely one dimensional. Joe Ingles can fill in certain spots here or there but he's gassed from the last month of carrying the load. Really relied on Bojan or Clarkson to be more than they can realistically expect to are. Hopefully Mike comes back next game otherwise this series is over.   Kinda funny this is almost the exact opposite the rockets series a couple years ago. Tons of shooters and no one to break down the defense and get them the ball in open spots
"I don't know what's going on with the Jazz but I never thought they'd get dominated in back to back games, then go on to lose a tight game without Kawhi and *at home*. Tonight was literally the Clips first win in Utah in 4 years, which is wild.   Makes you wonder how this series could have played out differently if Mike Conley was healthy."
"Man... I love Snyder, but when I saw Miye Oni get minutes I just, wow. His rotations seriously blow my mind sometimes. Oh well, was an entertaining series. I don't think a one-legged Mike Conley can save this one, if he even plays at all Game 6."
"I am beyond livid Mike Conley didn't play. Quite possibly this team's only realistic shot at a championship and we blow it trying to get someone a couple extra days rest.  Meanwhile the Nets put on their big boy pants, tell Harden ""we know you're not right, but you gotta play. We don't need you to dominate, but we need you out there"" and whilst he was kinda trash he still made some huge plays, and him just being out there opened things up for everyone else. Showed some balls and salvaged their season."
The Jazz really paid Mike Conley $70M over the last two years to help them win two playoff series. Tragic.
It’s appalling to me that Mike Conley couldn’t even give the Jazz 15 minutes in a must win game at $34M this year.
Fuck Mike conley!
"Mike Conley is another ""Street clothes."""
Alright Mike Conley. Time to come back. This is crunch time. There's no reason to miss game 6.
I like em tbh Gobert rubbed me the wrong way with his antics but he’s owned up to them and Don is a stud who seems like an awesome guy. Plus Mike Conley whos one of the nicest dudes in the league? Idk why you don’t like them
That was mike Conley.
Mike Conley is good
Donovan Mitchell didn't have a bum ankle and Mike Conley was on the floor.
Mike Conley simply has not shown up tonight
Damn Mike Conley really was a waste. Paid the man nearly $80M the last 2 seasons to win one playoff series.
This Jazz offense is so frazzled. I think this is where they really miss Mike Conley being a steady playmaker for the group.
Fuck it. Let's have Kawhi and Mike Conley 1v1 in wheelchair basketball
"If Mike Conley doesn't get healthy, you want us 100%. Donovan's got one good leg."
The jazz are so obviously in need of Mike Conley
They need Mike Conley back
"Man, the one big takeaway from this game:  The Jazz need Mike Conley back for game 6 regardless of the result tonight."
"Shit even if they had, say, someone like Mike Conley, I bet they’d be a top contender"
Not trying to be funny or anything but I honestly can't remember a time when Mike Conley wasn't injured.
"Mike Conley can play for the Monstars, and I will support that team."
"Mitchell, Bogey, and Gobert are sitting and these lineups with Ingles and Clarkson usually also have Mike Conley on the floor but since they don't we're playing Miye Oni who theoretically is a good shooter but doesn't space the floor and is not reliable from 3pt range at this point in his career, and Georges Niang who is an actual good 3pt shooter but has just been atrocious this series."
Did Mike Conley just change his hair?  Looking like Kyrie with a grown-out fro.
lol the Jazz really are frauds that are easy to scheme against in the postseason. (Don't give me that shit about Mike Conley. That dude is never healthy when it matters most.)
"imma play a bit of devils advocate here     \- Mike Conley is perpetually injured every year. reg. season, bubble season, i doesn't matter.   \-AD is perpetually injured. i.e. it would have been OUT of the ordinary if he was healthy IMO cause he never is.   \-Embiid is perpetually injured in the playoffs and actually had a supper long off season of rest   \-Kawhi had lots of load management during the season and was already injured during the reg despite that so while annoying his injury is far from outside the ordinary  \- kyrie's injury has zero to do with the nba schedule, my guy simply got hurt while getting undercut by another player.  \-similar to Kyrie, LBJ was hurt during to course of a game and very much was unrelated to exhaustion   &amp;#x200B;  while i think the NBA schedule and COVID messed with this season up (see CP3 COVID protocol), i see more correlation without causality, when looking at the majority of injuries."
i love mike conley
"LeBron, Anthony Davis, CP3, Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Joel Embiid all either missed playoff games or have played/are still playing injured.  Kawhi now joins the list.  OP: ""Are the Clippers cursed?""  Lol.  No.  There have been many key injuries during these playoffs."
Chris Paul out indefinitely for a positive Covid test SVG out as coach for the Pelicans Scott Brooks out as coach for the Wizards  Mike Conley out for tonight’s game with a hamstring sprain
"lol so dense, you've never seen injured players support their team? you see what mike conley is doing? but yea shows this is a business , not a real team"
When we all think of the true legendary stars of the NBA today the first few players that come to mind are Mike Conley and Jamal Murray.   Oh wait they don't? They are just extremely good players that play a vital role to their playoff team?   Huh...
&gt;it’s come to my attention Mike Conley won the NBA horse challenge in 2020  We really lost all sense of good TV entertainment back then.  We were just watching anything.
no mike Conley is the main one lol
Anthony Davis - Groin - LIMITED    LeBron James - Ankle - LIMITED    Chris Paul - Shoulder/COVID-19 -LIMITED    Joel Embiid - Meniscus tear - LIMITED    Luka Doncic - Neck - LIMITED    Donovan Mitchell - Ankle - LIMITED    Donte DiVencenzo - Foot - OUT    Jaylen Brown - Torn ligament - OUT    Jamal Murray - ACL - OUT    Kawhi Leonard - Knee - LIMITED    Mike Conley - Hamstring - OUT         Did I miss anyone?
Why do people keep saying this? Mike Conley has been out and Mitchell is playing inured
"Just to add a couple for the Jazz.   Mike Conley - Hammy  Donovan Mitchell - Ankle (Playing through, but hurt a bit)"
"The most worrisome thing about Harden's play yesterday isn't just his limited mobility, it's the fact that he's playing on a clearly un-healed hamstring injury, which means it's probably just a matter of time before he re-injures it (look at how he already re-injured it in Game 1 after a prior injury, or how Mike Conley re-injured his as well). A hamstring injury just takes time and rest to heal, and Harden instead is valiantly gutting it out and putting his body on the line. But as we saw in Game 1, it doesn't take much to re-injure it and it's unfortunately probably just a matter of time before he does.   I've said it before but these playoffs fucking suck with all of these injuries. Usually in the postseason we're trying to figure out who the best team is, but now we're just trying to figure out who's going to be healthiest. Maybe Embiid is too limited and Atlanta wins even though at full strength I think Philly is clearly better. Maybe Harden can't go and Milwaukee advances even though full strength Brooklyn is clearly better. Maybe because Kawhi is out the Jazz win, or because Conley is out the Clippers win. Maybe the Suns are in trouble without Chris Paul. And this is to say nothing of the teams that were already eliminated because of injuries.   The playoffs are not supposed to be like this. The NBA (owners and players) really fucked up with that shortened off-season last year and we're seeing the effects right now. And unfortunately this year's off-season is only going to be 2-3 weeks longer than last year's was."
And Mike Conley is still out
"Mike ""5th in MVP voting"" Conley, they call him"
"i mean i like divincenzo a lot, but mike conley is for sure a much better player"
"Given today’s news, I was expecting to read something about Mitchell or just “Jazz guard Mike Conley Jr., (dead) will be out indefinitely”"
"Those are the two that came to the top of my head. They’re pretty famous. Also your leaving out many American athletes who handle themselves with class and humbleness. Players like Stockton, Mike Conley, and Grant Hill. Like we have these debates all the time about which style of leadership is better between Bron and MJ."
You listed two non all-stars on your list (Murray and jaylen brown) and didn’t list Conley—an all-star who would be a perennial all-star if WC guards weren’t so stacked.  And if you think he’s the 4th or 5th most important person on the Jazz’s team you’re cracked. Through the regular season depending on the night the dude was never less than the third most important player on the team and was very often more consistent and more valuable defensively and in his ability to run the offense than Mitchell.  People not including the Jazz in conversations about teams dealing with injuries are casuals. Jazz are 2-2 against a healthy Clippers without an all-star PG. Sucks for Kawhi and the Clips but this injury balanced an imbalanced series more than anything. Put some respect on Mike Conley’s name.
8 all stars should be enough to compete: - Kawhi - Mike Conley - Donovan Mitchell - Joel Embiid - James Harden - Kyrie Irving - Anthony Davis - Chris Paul
"Mike conley’s a very good player but he’s not on the level of a Lebron, Davis, or Harden. C’mon man lol. At that point you can say the Nuggets missed Barton, the hawks missed Hunter, the hornets missed Hayward, the Grizzlies missed Jaren Jackson for most of the year, and so on.   Conley is a good player. But is he the fourth most important guy on your team? Possibly fifth? Mitchell and Gobert are unquestioned one and two. Royce O’Neale is a hell of a defender. Ingles and Clarkson are great off the bench - I’m not sure anyone has that kind of fire power coming off the bench like y’all do. And Bogdanovic is also a very good player. On a given night, conleys either the third most important, or the 5th or 6th.   So I wouldn’t hold him in the same group as the guys above."
We still don't have Mike Conley tho :/
Mike Conley
"Between Kyrie, CP3, Kawhi, Embiid, and Mike Conley this might be the biggest “What if” Conference finals in history cause of injury"
Do the names Donovan Mitchell or Mike Conley mean anything to you?
Because you’re comparing Kawahi to mike fucking Conley
Obviously Kawhi is better than Mike Conley but Conley is a great player too and an incredibly important part of the Jazz. Ingles doesn’t do well playing starter minutes and it throws off the Jazz’s rotations a lot having only one point guard. Having Conley massively levels up the Jazz’s offense.
"Mike Conley is an all star and led the league in +/- at one point this season, what are you talking about?"
I seriously doubt that. But let’s say everyone is healthy. Ibaka would cause more problems for the Jazz then Mike Conley would for the Clippers.
"Obviously kawhi is a better individual player than Mike, but the ramifications of Mike being out are quite high and I think Utah takes one of those LA games with Mike in. It's not as simple as 1 to 1 or even just magnitude of impact but don't act like a team missing it's starting point guard and primary ball handler isn't important especially against veterans like Ty Lue / Kawhi / PG when the rest of the jazz are a few years younger.   You said ""this affects the rest of the playoffs"" and so does Conley being out. Zero chance the jazz beat the Suns without Conley."
Bruh no lol. Don’t compare losing Kawhi to not having Mike Conley. Don’t do that
Nets in 6 Sixers in 6 Clips in 6 regardless if mike conley is available. Youve seen harden play? Conley will not be 100%
"No chance. PG is a lot of tiers above Jrue. They're not close at all. Jrue is a good borderline all star, like mike Conley sorta"
"Kyle’s talking to you, Mike Conley."
Rooting for only Mike Conley had been weird so far.
"Well that too, yeah - hamstring weaknesses due to injury can have knock-on effects on the rest of the body.   But even if he doesn't injure something other than his hammy by overcompensating, the hamstring injury itself could become problematic long term. Look at Mike Conley, for instance."
"Agreed. And - stating the obvious - this gets a whole lot easier if we have Mike back who can also dribble penetrate the lane, is the primary pick and roller with gobert, can pass out or spot up shoot it as well  The offense is too predictable with only Mitchell as a 3 level scorer. I’m happy we won 2 without Conley but we won’t win the series unless he is back"
Mike Conley will carry the torch for another 4-5 seasons before he retires
*When Mike Conley is out
Watch the game even when they switch everything there are still moments where Gobert is wide open down low and nobody hits him. Mike Conley makes those passes
"""Help us Mike Conley, you're our only hope!"""
Jazz fans when you tell them having a washed up 33 y/o Mike Conley wouldn’t of made a difference and they would’ve lost the series anyway: https://youtu.be/m51DtFXKyr4
"embarrassed? the embarrassing thing is thinking that mike conley isn’t competent. i meant watch basketball as in not just this game, but the whole season. if you did you’d know about mike. you cannot plan for injuries, and saying “GET A GOOD PG” while we have a great one injured on the bench doesn’t make sense."
"i’m saying that if you watched basketball you would know that we already have an amazing all star point guard in mike conley, who is currently injured."
Another way to ask this is will Mike Conley play in game 5.
Mike Conley hasn't played a game in this series
Mike Conley on the sidelines watching this makes me really nervous as a Clipper fan.
Is it just me or does Mike Conley kinda look like Lewis Hamilton? Keep thinking they're cutting to him lol
Mitchell is still getting better and Conley will get cheaper.  I imagine even if Mike comes back we’ll be in the market for a PG this draft.
That’s what the Jazz generally do with Conley and Mitchell. Without Mike our offense just grinds to a halt when Don has to sit.
Never imagined I’d be wishing to watch Mike Conley play but here we are
People will never understand how underrated mike Conley is.
"I can see the narratives now.   Jazz fans will say that this series was fundamentally changed by the absence of Mike Conley.  Smug Laker/Clipper/random Jazz haters will say ""Do you REAAAAAAALLY think Mike Conley would have made 20+ points of difference in games 3 and 4 and 5 and 6? No he wouldn't. The Jazz are chokers and underachievers."""
"Mike Conley has missed plenty of time these past few years, was relying on him a mistake?"
turns out the Jazz in fact need Mike Conley
Return of Mike Conley looming
We Need Mike Conley for key penetration or this series is over.
they are that desperate to stop Mike Conley that they don't have space to even put Rondo on the bench?
"If clippers are playing like this, well oiled offense - lockdown defense. As good as mike conley is, he will be a non factor"
"Top 10 defensive win shares for 2020-21  Spencer Dinwiddie  Henry Ellenson  Mike Conley  Rudy Gobert  LeBron James  Julius Randle  Elijah Bryant  Dante Exum  Ben Simmons  RJ Barrett  This is your voting list for all-defensive teams, correct?"
Mike Conley has been getting injured every other month though. It's different with other players.
"Sure but James harden, Kyrie, embiid, mike Conley out of those guys for a pretty normal offseason after the bubble."
Without Mike Conley lmao
(Not in any order): 1.Dame 2.steph 3. Trae  4.Luka  5.kemba 6. Lowry 7. Ben Simmons  8. Brogdon 9. Jamal Murray 10. Kyrie 11. Paul 12. Ja morant 13. Mike Conley 14. Lamelo ball 15. Jrue holiday  16. Shai Alexander  16. Fox &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Westbrook
"Shit i'd put simmons, bam, towns, murray, lavine, and mike conley who is oddly missing here all over him  I do think he's better than randle though"
"Bullshit lol. If Grayson Allen did this the sub would be at his throat. If Mike Conley or Jrue Holiday did this, there’d likely be a similar reaction to Jokic, with the majority questioning if it was truly worthy of an ejection. It’s about reputation and the history of a particular player, but I guess that doesn’t sound as profound as writing it off as a symptom of grand societal racism. Maybe you could argue that subtle racism can influence a player’s reputation and you might have a point, but pretending this sub thinks white player commits an intentional foul=clean and black player commits an intentional foul=dirty is pretty laughable."
"Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley you mean"
"Jazz aren’t winning another game unless Mike Conley comes back without looking rusty at all,  being from the future I can say that he returns for game 5 in Utah but he doesn’t look very good. game 6 he plays well but PG takes over with a 50 point game."
"You say that buuuut chemistry could play a factor and the Jrue/Giannis connection could be even better while Middleton plays at a similar or slightly better level. Like look at a similar caliber player in Mike Conley, Utah wasn't great last year but they got a lot better without many personnel changes, in large part due to Conley being much more in sync with the Jazz and their system after a year."
"If Harden and Kyrie remain injured, and with Danny Green out, I say yes. Especially if Mike Conley has a setback too, which he very well may."
"Mike Conley. He's the nicest guy in the world so within 5 minutes, he'd get everyone to stop fighting and rather focus their collective energies on community outreach or some shit"
Imagine if Dray Dray did it to a broken-faced Mike Conley. That would be even worse.
"That was one series. The injuries this year, caused by the 13-day offseason and super compressed schedule, have been a constant throughout the season and postseason. Let’s just look at these playoffs: LeBron, AD, Chris Paul (who is obvisohyl looking better now), Harden, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Dontae Divencenzo, Embiid, Kyrie, Hunter+Reddish. Basically every team had a very significant injury or two.  Yeah, everyone is usually banged up by this time but this has been different. Half the stars in the playoffs were either out or not even close to their real selves."
Mike Conley. He didn’t deserve to be an All-Star this year at all
"They shot 44% against the Suns. They shot 49% before Murray’s injury in the regular season. Even assuming they managed to keep that regular season percentage up (which they wouldn’t have, because it’s the playoffs and the Suns are a very good defensive team) you’re talking AT MOST five fewer transition opportunities a game (assuming a) every extra missed basket was a transition opportunity and b) they could never push the pace off a made basket anyway, both of which are also obviously untrue).  I know it’s the thing to hate on the Suns right now but this is such clear and obvious grasping at straws. Their defence was bad because Jokic and MPJ were getting remorselessly targeted, which happened in the half court. The same thing happened to them in the playoffs last year, that’s why they also gave up 120 a game to the Jazz despite Murray being in some form you could never reasonably expect him to replicate again and came within a Mike Conley shot of being knocked out first round. They’re just a bad defensive team."
Yeah I’m sure that had nothing to do with Tony Allen and Mike Conley.
"Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Donavan Mitchell, Kwahi Leonard, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, Joel Embiid, Trae Young, Jaylon Brown, Kemba Walker, James Harden, Kyrie Irving"
"What? I haven't seen any Jazz slander and I follow the Jazz-related threads, because I've been rooting for them for the last few years. The only time I see the Utah Jazz being slandered, is because of the racist fans in the stands or calling Salt Lake City boring, but I haven't seen any animosity against the actual team. Criticism of Mike Conley for example, is not a slander against the team itself."
"&gt;It was more of a long term contract dump than a salary dump. They still took on salary to make the trade work, but it was in the form of expiring contracts.   Still a salary dump. The Grizzlies lost 3 more years of Pau for a total of $49.4 million. The only salary they added beyond that year was Crittenton's $2.9 million. Plus they saved the pro-rated difference between Pau's 2007-08 $13.7 million salary and the total $11.2 million in salaries for Brown, Crittenton, and the quickly signed Aaron McKie to make the numbers work.   They signed Marc to a 3 year approximately $9 million deal. They traded Milicic to get ZBo, but they worked it so they traded Milicic to the Knicks for Quentin Richardson who made about $2 million more, and then traded Richardson to the Clippers for ZBo. I don't know why they did it other than maybe the Knicks gave them money for saving them a little money on payroll, and the Clippers got a smaller trade exception for the deal. Adding ZBo added $33.7 million to the payroll, which is still less than Pau's remaining deal. Plus they saved Milicic's $7.5 million. So it was more like they added $26.2 million while saving $49.4 million.   Plus Heisley was making money churning that cap space into cash payments from teams trying to save money on the luxury tax. To the extent the NBA put a rule limiting how much money a team can receive cumulatively in cash payments for trades in a season.     Eventually ZBo was signed to a new big money deal, but there was no guarantee that would happen.   &gt;Was cardinal for ariza actually on the table, or is that wishful thinking?  Just an idea looking at the Lakers roster and salaries back in 2008. I was livid the Grizzlies didn't shed Cardinal's contract in getting rid of Pau, their number one asset.  &gt;I’m not saying that was the best deal the Grizzlies could have gotten, but, in the long run, it wasn’t as one sided as originally perceived. People at the time were judging the trade as if both teams were in “win now” mode. The lakers certainly were, but the griz were about to go through the tear down/ rebuild process. That’s how the trade should have been judged from the Grizzlies perspective and it takes a few years to fully evaluate that type of trade.  True and if the same deal had been done with the Kings or the Pistons instead of the Lakers, there wouldn't have been an outcry. The Grizzlies handed the Lakers two titles.   The Mike Conley trade was very similar to the Pau trade (Two veterans with expiring contracts, young player on rookie deal, two first round draft picks) and the national pundits loved it."
* Mike Conley * Iguodala * Danny Granger * Gerald Wallace * Tyson Chandler  Not much scoring but they'll hold teams to 50 ppg so it's okay
"Been a jrue fan since he was sadly shipped away from phili to NO. It’s so great people finally recognize bro is a dog and is an amazing player. You love to see it, I just still don’t get why the fuck he wasn’t an all star in 2018 but they give mike freaking Conley one over dense this year cuz he’s “never been”"
G - Mike Conley  G- Jrue Holiday  F- Andre Iguodala  F- Andre Kirilenlo  C -Tyson Chandler  Nobody's scoring on this team
I didn’t get to see Doc play really so I didn’t choose guys I never got to watch but yeah he in many ways is a better fit to complement all star level talent than Cassell. Realized doing this how hard it is to find a point guard who’s a strong playmaker 3 point shooter and defender. Which is a byproduct of eras also. I was basically looking for someone 10-15% better than Mike Conley  Van Exel was like Mashburn to me we probably overrate them now in hindsight a little. Cross era stuff is difficult there were a lot of great defensive centers and unique Kirilenko Iguodala type wings I wanted but i just don’t know how optimal that lack of spacing is in today’s era. And there were a lot of really talented players like Shareef Abdur Rahim where trying to fit them into a lineup wasn’t super easy
Imagine having Keldon Johnson and Love on the team instead of young stars like Zion and Brandon Ingram. DeRozan. Westbrook. Butler. Lonzo. Mike Conley. Randle. None of these people came out and said no?
I would much rather have people that actually pass the ball than any of those like Randle and Mike Conley if his hamstring is good.
Replace Mike Conley with Lillard and I think the Jazz have a very good shot at a chip
"We’ll give you Mike Conley, but the kicker is you never run the risk of getting jingled if you’re on our team."
Mike Conley is a UFA and isn't agreeing to go to Portland post Dame lol. Be realistic.

"Eric Gordon I believe, Mike Conley was hobbled and I forgot what was wrong with the Rockets. In the finals 2 of the top 3 players were gone. Not to diminish what the Warriors had to do to win those playoffs that year, it's not the dubs fault that the other teams weren't healthy."
Who is better Mike Conley or Jrue Holiday
"isnt the big killer to Utah rn the Mike Conley contract? If you can dump that, you would have a bit of cash to get a number 2 option behind Mitchell"
"If they're trying to go all in before Pop retires, trade Dejounte and Derrick to the Mavs for KP and a 2025 1st.   Then use your crazy cap space to try to sign one of CP3, Kyle Lowry, or Mike Conley. If you strike out on them, settle for someone who you know is just chasing the bag and a starting spot, like Dennis Schroeder or Spencer Dinwiddie.   Use your leftover money to add another quality starter, if possible, particularly a shooting guard. Maybe you can entice Oladipo with an overpay, or Kelly Oubre. If Josh Richardson opts out, maybe you get him.  Round out the bench with some vets.   Ideal lineup would be CP3/Oladipo/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Vassell, Justise Winslow, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller off the bench.   More likely scenario would be Schroeder/Vassell/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, James Johnson, Robin Lopez"
Fuck no lol Mike fucking Conley just got his first all star selection this season
"This was a really good write up. To add, the few times USA would try to find each other on cuts/backdoor passes, you could see the chemistry was just not there yet. KD dropped a few passes that would’ve led to easy buckets, but that’s something that will be corrected with time.   The defense is truly the big issue. The US is not nearly aggressive enough on that end, especially compared to Nigeria and Aus, who literally make basic passes hard to complete. You have to hope a line up involving Draymond and Jrue can cover a lot of holes.   Also, a lot of redundant players. Love Lavine, but not sure the point of having him, Beal, and Tatum. All similar styled players, all can shoot from 3, but you’d think one of those spots would’ve been better spent on a defensive minded PG like Mike Conley."
76ers should make a run for Mike Conley.
"So was Gasol. And yeah, Lowry is actually much closer to Gasol in this situation then fucking mike conley. But expecting philly fans to be able to evaluate talent properly has Ben a futile endeavor for a while now."
"Okay, so an unproven young player (Grayson Allen), a rotation wing (Jae Crowder), filler (Kyle Korver) and 2 first round picks (#23 in 2019 + the protected 2020 pick). From my understanding the ask for Lowry was Maxey and/or Thybulle (young player/s), Danny Green (rotation wing), Mike Scott (filler) and potentially 2 first round picks (both of which would most likely be in the late, late 20s). Okay, so the ask for Lowry included one extra asset, and I understand valuing Thybulle (not Maxey) very highly, but consider that it would have been a trade to a division rival and direct competitor (which is never discussed), Lowry has a way better resume than Conley, and both teams knew that the 76ers' guard play was their weakest link.  The Gasol trade didn't involve any first round picks but did involve JV, who was one of the team's main centers, and Delon Wright, who was also an important rotation player. The commonality is that it required parting with important rotation and depth pieces to shore up a glaring weakness in the roster.  Did it guarantee anything? Of course not. Gasol could've broken his pinky toe a week before the playoffs and it would've been a disaster. But when you have a guy like Embiid playing the best basketball of his life and you know his clock is ticking, you have to maximize your team's championship window and Morey failed to do that."
"Booker was *not* ""significantly"" more efficient. To reiterate: Booker's eFG% was just 1.3% better than Donovan's in the regular season, and was worse during the playoffs. Donovan even had a better overall FG% during the playoffs, despite the fact Donovan was shooting far, far more 3s.   If you can only point to data from last year to make your point - fine, but be aware that that's not a good sign for the strength of your argument.  I don't think you understand just how brilliant Donovan's playoff run was this year - and all of it on a bad ankle, no less.  &gt;Who besides CP3 and Booker are all stars? And then what about Gobert? He doesn't exist all of a sudden? lol  Gobert was an All-Star thanks to his defensive capabilities, not his offensive ones. But you know that.  I'll say this just one more time: Donovan was so good against the Clippers that in game 3, the entire Clippers defensive strategy became ""Shut down Don."" Seriously. Watch footage from that game and game 4. They keyed in entirely on Donovan, in a way that would have been able to be countered if Mike Conley had been available - but since it turns out no one on the Jazz can serve as a viable backup PG, the team suffered.  And yet despite the fact the Clippers strategy became keying in on Donovan, he *still* had huge games. The only game he underperformed in was game 5, when he was clearly not playing at 100% because of his ankle. And he *still* came back in game 6 and scored 39 in an elimination game.  Up until this year, I would have agreed and thought that Booker was very slightly better overall, at least taking the regular season in to account. But if you look at how each player has done in the playoffs this season, Donovan outperformed Booker by a substantial margin, and there's nothing you can point to that says otherwise."
"Yea the Timberwolves are most likely not getting Ben Simmons, and we really shouldn't even be a main focus point of discussion. There are better trade scenarios that could be had without the Timberwolves being involved such as:     \-Malcom Brogdan  \-Kemba Walker  \-Lowry S&amp;T  \-CJ McCollum/Damien Lillard (unlikely)  \-Mike Conley S&amp;T  \-Collin Sexton     The only thing the Timberwolves truly have to offer is DLo, but even then I have a hard time figuring out why the 76ers would make that trade, unless they value the scoring aspects of DLo and are willing to look past his defensive struggles."

"...while he himself was injured, and had no backcourt help in one game and 50% of Mike Conley in the other.  But sure, let's pretend a Chris Paul that's rolling is the same thing as a hobbling Mike Conley and combination of Joe Ingles and Miye Oni."
"Mike Conley, FVV, Pat Bev.  Size is definitely better but you can still be an extremely good defender as a small guy.  Mitchell is a solid defender, too, he just carries too heavy a load on offense to be a two-way player most of the time.  They put him on  Murray in the Nuggets series last year late in the series and he did an excellent job."
Mike Conley.
"That they have major flaws and weakness with their 200 million dollar man. Mike Conley was hurt for 5 games but still. That’s my whole point tho, the jazz were never that good in the first place while the entire NBA world acted like they were the best team ever when they were frauds the whole time."
Sign Mike Conley
"I remember Mike Conley wearing that mask because of a broken orbital bone, (co-?) leading that Grizzlies team to a six game series against the Warriors in the conference semis the year GSW won its first of several. That’s about as well as anyone did against them in that timeframe. (Cavs also won two in the Finals, otherwise Warriors swept round 1 and made a gentleman’s sweep of the Rockets in WCF.) And Conley’s team *was* #1 seed in the west this year. He doesn’t have a ring and doesn’t look to be HOF, but he’s had a damn impressive career, ahead of probably 90% of the guards he’s a contemporary of.  It’s worth noting that before Mike Conley (Jr - he dropped the Jr) got to the NBA he had played alongside Greg Oden at Ohio State and AAU for years. It must be weird for both of them how their careers shook out."
It’s hard to even listen to your points if you just seriously called Mike Conley trash.
Should have tried Kyle Lowry or maybe mike Conley if he was available.
"Wiggins was literally second (behind Mike Conley) in opponent FG% and played *stifling* defense all season. He's a significantly better shooter and a reliable iron man, while Pascal Siakam was a worse shooter *before* his shoulder injury and is generally quite injury-prone."
Mike Conley this year
Oden was always injured. He was injured half the year at osu and he was injured in high school a lot. I went to high school around the same time as him and my school played them twice a year. Crazy to think that team had Mike Conley and Greg oden.
Cause none of the perimeter defenders could stop PG or the guys around him either  Royce O Neale aint stopping him nor is Mike Conley on one leg
It's that Mike Conley 'he'd be an all-star five times if he played for a fashionable team in the East' logic
"It happened in 2015. Warriors played Pelicans without Jrue Holiday, Grizzlies without Mike Conley, and then in the Finals the Cavs without Kyrie and Love. Don't think anyone cares today."
"Nah just wait until the regular season and they have one good game. We gonna be hearing about team underrated as usual: Mike Conley, Ben Simmons, Rudy Gobert, Jrue Holiday, Patrick Beverly   r/NBA loves hyping up guys that get exposed badly during the playoffs every year because of ""potential"" or ""underrated"" or whatever."
I hate to say it but Mike Conley would be a perfect fit on the Bucks
Mike Conley is also a shout
It’s exactly as important as I think lol. You’re naming complete outliers and trying to pass it off as the norm. This season there was a total of one player (Zion) who made the all star team in the west that wasn’t on a playoff team. 24/27 total players were on playoff teams. Yes an outlier like Zion can make it in certain seasons but the vast majority of the time team record has a pretty big effect. There’s a reason Mike Conley was selected as an injury all star over the numerous guards that were better than him on lower teams. The voters like to “reward” winning.
Yeah that’s Mike Conley
"""Mike Conley hasn't shown anything in the playoffs""  ""That's not true""  ""smh hivemind"""
"The biggest downgrade of the Dallas roster to me, particularly in the playoffs was missing Seth Curry. That guy coulda really put the nail in the coffin of a lot of our games against each other. He *killed* us in 2020.   From what you’re describing, maybe Mike Conley would be a better target?"
Mike Conley
"Both answers would be Mike Conley.  He is the nicest person in the world, so he could very easily explain the stakes to the defender/shooter and they would comply in order to save my life.  Thank you Mountain Mike."
"Bro the clippers lost their best player and you still couldn’t beat them. You guys also lost a 3-1 lead to the Nuggets last year WITH Mike Conley who then got destroyed by the eventual champions. You guys aren’t contenders at this moment. You rely way too much on the 3 and Donovan Mitchell isn’t good enough to carry you (yet, maybe he will be down the line)."
Remember when Mike Conley missed 5 games in the Clippers series? Or when Luka played half the series with a neck strain/nerve issue?
"&gt; Lol dude they took 6 games to beat the Clippers who were missing their best player.  Suns missed CP3 for 2 games and Booker had a broken nose for 5 of them too... Clips have a good squad, why would the expectation be to sweep them?  &gt;They were down 2-1 before AD got hurt.   Once again, injured CP3. And they were up big in game 4 before AD got hurt.  &gt;The fact that the Jazz, who were the 1 seed, couldn’t beat the 4 seed who were missing their best player totally invalidates your point.  What does the Jazz without Mike Conley losing have anything to do with the Suns? The Suns had the 2nd best record in the league and the best record against playoff teams going into the postseason.  Sure they weren't the Finals favorites, and they caught some breaks, but if you thought they didn't have a chance to make the Finals you just simply didn't watch them all year.  Which you probably didn't because nobody pays attention to them."
"&gt; Drafting Hasheem Thabeet at #2 ahead of Harden, Curry, DeRozan.  It's been widely reported that the Grizzlies owner at the time demanded Thabeet to be the pick.   &gt; Trading away Kevin Love for OJ Mayo on draft night.  Would still do that trade 10/10 times. The PF starting spot went to Zach Randolph. Would not even want to think of the Grizzlies without Zach Randolph, plus Kevin Love would have demanded a trade eventually like he did in Minny.  &gt; Signing Chandler Parsons to a max contract.  It was either that or Evan Turner and Chandler Parsons was deemed the better prospect. If we didn't sign Chandler Parsons, Mike Conley was ready to sign with Dallas.   &gt; Trading the farm for 1 season of Jeff Green.  Trade a protected first for a player that we thought at the time could take the aging Grit N Grind team over the hump. Ended up being the #14 pick. Playoff teams take that risk all of the time.  &gt; Sitting but not trading Tyreke Evans while he was averaging 20/5/5 on a team that was tanking.  We had lowball offers, the Celtics wanted two seconds for him. I don't blame him for waiting until the last second to see if a playoff team flinches and offers a first. I am not losing sleep not having the two late 2nds."
"I said this below, but Wallace made three high profile moves back then which were *all* universally mocked at the time, but which all turned out to be right. The Gasols trade was one, the trade to get Zach Randolph was two, and the Mike Conley extension was three.   Z-Bo was seen at the time as a talented guy who had been trouble for years and who was [mainly a punchline](https://youtu.be/rh2fn01cngg) well before he even ended up on the Clippers. And Mike Conley was seen as this very disappointing young player that the Grizzlies had wasted a pick on, so his large contract extension was mocked by some (even Grizzlies fans like Matt Moore) as [""the worst contract handed out that year""](https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-kelly-dwyer/mike-conley-just-got-paid--nba.html) as soon as it was signed.   These moves had most people putting him in the same category as GMs like David Kahn and Billy King. And yet... they all turned out to be smart moves that built a Western conference powerhouse for years to come. I still don't know, was that just pure blind luck, or did he simply know something nobody else did? Surely he deserves *some* credit for building those Grit n Grind teams, right?"
"I remember back then he made three high profile moves which literary everyone thought were huge blunders at the time, but which all turned out to be great moves in retrospect. The Pau for Marc trade was one, the Zach Randolph trade was two, and the big Mike Conley contract was three. Nobody knew anything about Marc, [people thought Z-Bo was just a meme,](https://youtu.be/rh2fn01cngg) and people thought Conley had been underwhelming and [totally undeserving of a contract like that,](https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-kelly-dwyer/mike-conley-just-got-paid--nba.html) but Wallace really nailed all three moves and made everyone have to eat crow on their criticisms."
"The biggest overall is probably the Dominique Wilkins situation. If he didn’t immediately want out/our team wasn’t on the brink of financial collapse, then he, Stockton and Malone would’ve probably won multiple titles. The late 80s/early 90s jazz desperately needed another scorer, especially one at the SF spot. That team would’ve contended with the Bad Boys and the first bulls threepeat.   The Mike Conley injury is going to be another one for awhile. Could’ve very well cost us a championship."
What if MJ doesn’t make The Shot to beat the Jazz in 6  What if Bojan Bogdanovic didn’t get injured last year before the bubble  What if Mike Conley had made the three in Game 7 vs Nuggets   And what if he had been healthy vs Clippers
"I really don't know how this guy continues to get a job in scouting of all departments lol.  Here are a list of examples that made absolutely no sense:      The Grizzlies shipped out a first-rounder, Tayshaun Prince and Quincy Pondexter for Jeff Green, Russ Smith and a 2015 second-rounder.      Drafting Hasheem Thabeet at #2 ahead of Harden, Curry, DeRozan.      Trading away Kevin Love for OJ Mayo on draft night in a 8 player trade.      Signed Parsons to that god awful max contract.      Sitting a 20/5/5/ Tyreke Evans on a team that wasn't good, in which he also defended his stance on the team slowly picking it back up, even if they weren't tanking.      **Draft results:**      2007: Mike Conley      2008: Love for Mayo swap      2008: Donte Greene      2009: Hasheem Thabeet      2009: DeMarre Carroll      2010: Xavier Henry      2010: Dominique Jones      2010: Greivis Vasquez      2012: Tony Wroten      2014: Jordan Adams      2015: Jarrell Martin      2016: Wade Baldwin IV      2018: Jaren Jackson Jr.      Looking pretty pretty bad.... So he hit on like what, 2-3 picks?"
"He was responsible for some risky decisions that worked out amazingly well: the Pau Gasol trade, drafting Mike Conley, bringing in ZBo and Tony Allen.  He was also responsible for several backbreaking decisions.  Memphis folks generally dislike him, though I have heard people saying that the Love, Thabeet, and Parsons decisions weren't really on him, so who knows."
"He didn’t hit on a draft pick from 2008 until 2018. The most egregious miss was Thabeet over Harden and Curry, but check this out:  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MEM/draft.html  Pretty grim. Mike Conley was a good pick, OJ Mayo was fine, and then a bunch of shit until his last draft, where he picked JJJ."
6'1 Mike Conley Sr.  I think the link is higher in the thread now.
"Two entries I'd like to add: Gallinari and Mike Conley Jr. He has the vibe of Leon, who used to be in all those 90s movies like Above the Rim. Even kind of shoots like him."
"Reminder that Mike conleys 6'1 dad, Mike conley, an Olympian had the furthest back free throw line dunk"
Mike Conley is adored in Memphis.
Got to have Mike Conley in this
"Bro said mike conley😂. Cmon now. Mac got in with like6-7 all star appearances, never made it past 1st round and was an injury prone chucker once he got to houston, and he was first ballot. Lowry’s definitely a lock"
Yawwwwn   He’s not the only two way Pg. Mike Conley doesn’t exist all of a sudden?  6 isn’t enough. Plus All star is a mid season award at the end of the day. You gotta supplement those with all NBA and Lowry only has one.   He’s only the best player of this franchise because he’s the only one that stuck around. And plus its the raptors. They don’t really have legends like that so there’s no competition.  He’s just not a A or S tier player/career. He’s hall of very good
I like Mike Conley
"Mike ""The Dread Pirate"" Conley."
I think mike Conley also shoots with his opposite hand
He would have nagging shit going on towards the end of the year even when he played though.   &gt; There are enough examples of older players overcoming this to make me think it's worth it to sign a player like Mike Conley.  Other than CP3... who?
"He did a good job staying healthy in Memphis. He missed games in a tanking season because he elected to get surgery to correct something giving him pain, but other than that he was reliable. It's just since he got to the Jazz that he has tended to injure his hamstrings late into the season.  There are enough examples of older players overcoming this to make me think it's worth it to sign a player like Mike Conley."
"&gt; 55% TS, which is higher than guys like Jrue (53%) and Mike Conley (53.5%) and CJ (53%), none of which I see commonly thought of as playoff chokers, in fact CJ and Jrue are praised for their playoff performances  Plenty of people shit on CJ all the time, and everyone knows Jrue has been extremely inconsistent/bad with his jump shot in these playoffs.  It's just that he's been good at essentially everything else (except the turnovers in the last game)."
"Depth plays a big factor in this. The Grizzlies are agreed upon as a bottom 3 all time team, but they have Conley/Ja on the court for 48 minutes. That’s a lot better than having to play 8-10 minutes of Delly/old Mo Williams/Quinn Cook/even Shaun Livingston. They also have at least one Gasol out there at all times. Throw in 5-6 really good wings that can play in different scenarios: Battier/Eddie Jones/Mike Miller/Shareef Abdur-Rahim/Tony Allen/Gay. I don’t think it’s as cut and dry as everyone else does."
"Believe it or not, Mike Conley is right handed but shoots with his left"
"Seeing ""All-Star"" included in a sentence with Mike Conley that isn't about him getting snubbed is weird to see"
A team consisting of Mike Conley Mike Miller? Shane Battier Pau Gasol Marc Gasol+ amazing depht would be able to beat them
All-star Mike Conley. Has a nice ring to it.
"Yes max all-star mike conley, he does deserve it"
"Tbf, he also Tweets out congratulations to Mike Conley from time to time... So there's that..."
Give Derozan or Mike Conley a 1 year deal let the team play out. If they struggle trade Porzingis and get as much money for next years free agency class
"Wiggins had more defensive win shares this season and was second only to Mike Conley in opponent FG%. Siakam is not a better defender statistically.  Any player who needs the ball in his hands to be effective is a significant downgrade, since that would mean taking the ball *out* of the hands of vastly better players.  The ability to play off ball is enough to make Wiggins better than Pascal."
"I didn’t say just Irving and Love. Every team the Warriors faced that year PG was injured Jrue Holiday, Pat Bev, Mike Conley plus Chris Paul was injured and John Wall. I mean hell the Thunder didn’t even make playoffs due to KD and Russ injuries it was a weird year."
"Because it's laughable to compare the players he did to the ones that were hurt.  Jrue, Pat Bev, Motiejūnas, and Mike Conley to:  Kawhi, Giannis, AD, and Jamal Murray??  In 2015 those 4 players had **ONE** ASG appearance between the 4.  The others have **EIGHTEEN.**"
Mike Conley and Tony Allen were out and Dwight Howard had a torn MCL but still played
PG - Mike Conley or Lillard SG - Jrue Holiday or Jimmy Butler SF - Giannis PF - PJ Tucker C - Al Horford
"One hundred percent.  On the Warriors, Wiggins has been a statistically better defender, averaging 2.7 defensive win shares to Siakam's 2. Two-Way Wiggs has been a lockdown defender against wings, guards, AND bigs. This season he was second to only Mike Conley in opponent FG%.  He's a better shooter, and he only missed *one* game this season - and that was a decision by coaching staff to rest the starters in a game that didn't matter, he *could* have played.  Siakam, meanwhile, has injury problems - who knows how his shooting will be at all after having a significant shoulder injury - and doesn't have the advantage (which Wiggins does) of having over a season to learn to play within the flow of Golden State's quite complex offensive system.  Wiggins is *excellent* at that.  The Warriors have Draymond Green and the Splash Brothers. What they need is reliable depth. Sacrificing a very reliable player who's been solid and consistent *plus more depth* for Pascal Siakam makes the Warriors worse."
"Almost every star this playoff got injured though, especially on the teams they faced.  You saying almost every team built a team of injury prone players?  Anthony Davis,  Lebron James, Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Jaylen Brown  I mean even Chris Paul got hurt, and Booker broke his nose.  Those are just the guys who would be considered stars."
"It’s hard to respect because they’ve had arguably the easiest path to the finals in the last 20 years? Mike Conley missed 5 games that series, but yeah the Jazz were frauds regardless. The Blazers never really had any expectations to begin with."
"Lmao you do not hate to be that guy or you would have just moved on. Nothing compelled you to continue this conversation, and no one cares if you think you're better than an espn personality, when no one thinks espn is any good anyway.   And on top of that, your whole thing that started the conversation was stanning for lebron and I said he couldn't carry the team. He needed help from AD and he wouldn't get it. And I said that repeatedly lol    And lo and behold that's exactly what happened.   And stop your whining. Mitchell played the entire series on a bum ankle and Mike conley didn't play except one desperate game he wasn't actually healthy enough to play in.  The suns did without Chris paul most of the second round.  The clippers didn't have kawhi.  Embiid played hurt all postseason.  The nets all took turns getting hurt.  Giannis just fucked up his knee.  Trae young fucked his ankle on a ref.  And lebron went out in round 1 cuz he's too old to carry anyone. Which is why everyone is already saying ""who can the Lakers get to be their third star""  Everyone has an excuse.    Get a life dude."
The Cavs were the only injury riddled team they played in 2015. The injuries on other teams wouldn’t even make an ESPN headline in any other championship run. Jrue Holiday was injured in January and his team made the playoffs without him. Mike Conley missed one game. He played every other game and he was available when his team was up 2-1. The Warriors beat every member of the All NBA first team in that playoff run which has never been done before. I’ve never met anyone who actually believes any of the injuries to ancillary players in that championship run would have actually made the difference if they played.
"Ayton but we also didn’t get to see Mike Conley (especially healthy Mike Conley) with Gobert, which is who has been optimizing Gobert offensively all year. Due to this we got a severely diminished offensive Gobert and a severely diminished offense in general."
"Shoutout Mountain Mike going off that game too going shot for shot w Kawhi down the stretch hitting dagger floaters (Kawhi had 43/8/3/7 treys/6stl/4to, Conley had 35/9/8/1stl/3to)"
"So what would you have done? Kept Jrue and gotten to the 8th seed? Traded Jrue for Mike Conley, or Kemba, or someone else?"
&gt; I swear people have just forgot Mike Conley exists  Easy to do that when dude is always injured.
Kyle Lowry is a free agent as well as Mike Conley.
I swear people have just forgot Mike Conley exists
Mike Conley could never hold Lamar odoms crack pipe either
Mike Conley could never hold Lamar Odom or Monta Ellis’ jockstrap
"Conley had an awesome year last year, and was running the offense to perfection. Snyder’s system really drives down assist totals for point guards, but Conley was a top 5 floor general last year and shot 41% from 3 on almost 7 attempts per game. There’s a reason why a lot of advanced stats had him as a top 10 overall player in the regular season. I don’t think he’s that high and he’s stealing a bit of Rudy’s on/off thunder by sharing the floor with him so often, but Mike was playing at a very high level all of last year."
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
Marc Gasol and Mike Conley.
Mike Conley was the highest paid player for like 3 days.
Yeah definitely 1. Steph Curry 2. Chris Paul 3. James Harden 4. Luka Doncic 5. Damien Lillard 6. Mike Conley 7. Jrue Holiday 8. Trae Young  9. Malcom Brogdon 10.De’aaron Fox
"&gt;Teams are already calling 2022 free agency ""The Offseason of the Rotational Players.""  Was 2021 that much better?  Top (potential) free agents were:         Kawhi (doesn't count; wasn't leaving)   CP3 (old)   John Collins   Kyle Lowry (old)   Mike Conley   Demar DeRozan   Devonte Graham       Other names:   Duncan Robinson   Lonzo Ball   Danny Green"
He will be the highest until the very next supermax. The record will get broken over and over again   Mike Conley was at one point the highest paid player.
Put Mike Conley in over MCW for sure.
Mike Conley and Patty Mills
Mountain Mike Conley had some pretty formidable chops himself
You'll have to ask the people that claim the Warriors faced only injured teams in the 2015 playoffs.   Mike Conley had the best game of his career in game 2 that year so if the Grizzlies were hobbled as they say then so was Steph.   Same thing with Jrue and the Pels. Jrue scored 17 (averaged 15 that year) against the Rockets right before the playoffs so if Steph was fine then so was Jrue.   Who was supposedly injured on the Rockets? Dwight? Dude scored 28 in the first round so same thing.
"Meh, you're just looking at the lottery results and saying ""tank.""   The year they got Jaren Jackson, Mike Conley got hurt and only played 12 games.   The following season they still won 33 games, including 10-13 post all-star, which is nowhere near *good* enough to be a tank. They just jumped from 7th to 2nd in the lottery."
Mike Conley is still in the league
Of course.  Tony Parker didn’t play during the advanced stats centered era lol.    Besides if you look at playoff stats you’d see a different story.   Mike conley Donovan Mitchell and ingles aren’t horrible perimeter defenders lol. The jazz defensive scheme is to funnel perimeter players into gobert because that’s the only Way to really make him shine with his only real playoff caliber skill being rim protection. However he just got cooked so he didn’t really even give that either.
Mike Conley shouldn't have made it anyway. Fox was definitely more deserving.
This is just my skewed view on what I’d expect from each pick by using a player and their accolades/skill  1 - John Wall   2-5/6 - Al Horford/Mike Conley level  6-10 -Wiggins  11-14 - Terry Rozier before he left Boston  Past Lottery you should be happy with a starter/25mpg level guy imo
Did you just call MIKE CONLEY a top 15 player??
"Mike Conley makes sense/prolly shouldn't count.  I think most players in the league *need* an agent in order to navigate the business side of their sport.  But there are some are some who you know would succeed in life even without basketball- via demeanor, intellect, or both.  Chris Bosh signed up with Rob Pelinka but he's a guy who it wouldn't have surprised me if he'd represented himself.  Conley is similar, he's very intelligent/composed/pragmatic."
They arent going to trade Mike Conley
I only learned last month that Mike Conley was the son of *that* Mike Conley.  Senior was a pretty big celebrity in 1992 and 1996.
Seems like you are right. I just saw the name Mike Conley on the list of agents who made the most profit.  It's actually Mike Conley Sr
Mike Conley and Sebastian Vettel
Mike Conley was the highest paid at one point. These things happen.
Mike Bibby was the Mike Conley of the 00’s
The first basketball game I ever watched was Clipps v Jazz a couple of years ago and Mike Conley scored something like 20 points in the third quarter alone. I was like damn this guy can hoop but he also looks like one of the nicest people ever
Mike Conley
Kawhi vs mike Conley that last fateful year before the warriors series. Kawhi was truly on another level and Mike somehow kept up as best he could.
"Mike Conley? Klay? Donovan Mitchell? Y’all really desperately throwing names out there and hoping it sticks. The Suns as the 2 seed faced a Lakers team that earned it’s 7 seed because of injuries, yet still had to play 4 games of AD and Lebron. Then swept the MVP who beat the healthy version of the team the Lakers beat in the first round last year. Including Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley is fucking hilarious when we beat the team that beat Mike Conley and Donovan Mitchell (2-0 without Kawhi), it’s not our fault the Jazz weren’t good enough to make the wcf"
"Look at the top scorers on lottery winners the past few years:   2021 draft: Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Collin Sexton, Pascal Siakam  2020 draft: Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall (WTF?), Devonte Graham, Zach Lavine  2019 draft: Julius Randle, Mike Conley, Kevin Knox (also WTF), Lebron James  Well, if you go by that list being eligible players, then I guess it's Lebron... Well, this was a huge waste of time."
"Fawn May Her - Thon Maker  My Honor Lee - Mike Conley  Giannis T. Ma - Janis Timma  Steve Naismith - Stephen A. Smith  Jeff Petry - Idk, Petry sounds like Presti or Perry though"
"Mike Conley and Marc Gasol, relatively quiet dudes, not trash talkers.  ZBo and Tony Allen, absolute shit talkers and instigators and love them for it."
My guesses:  Marger Salt: Marc Gasol  My Honor Lee: Mike Conley  Brego Dean: Greg Ofen  Fawn May Her: Thon Maker  Meatloaf Taya Dickso: Milos Teodosic
1. No idea  2. Stephen A. Smith  3. No idea  4. Marc Gasol  5. Mike Conley  6. No idea  7. Jay Triano  8. Thon Maker  9. Milos Teodosic
He hurt Mike Conley.
Mike Conley
Rubio is a currently a better player than broke dick Mike Conley.
"With injuries to LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Klay, Donovan Mitchell..."
If Mike Conley makes it the hall of fame should be shut down. Same with Kemba Walker and John Wall.
"As someone that's a huge Juan Stockton fan, you are absolutely smoking crack if you think he's better than Mike Conley at any point in both their careers."
Ricky Rubio prime&gt; Lonzo Ball/ Mike Conley I might be biased since Rubio is my favorite NBA player of all time but I truly think he's good
"Mike Conley has been underrated for years, so he's already been forgotten"
"You have to be really good to be an all star these days. If Fultz turned out to be as good as Mike Conley level player I think people would view that as a success after his start, and Conley only just made the all star team as an injury replacement."
"Definitely, I haven’t seen too much of that but even as a OKC fan that’s a little overboard. I do think he should’ve been the all star replacement this year. But I understand why mike Conley got it. I think he COULD be a top 5-10 player in the league, however some players just never make that 2nd leap from all star to super star. Most players don’t make that jump actually."
Mike Conley actually tho. He was a huge part of Utah and they absolutely could’ve beaten Phoenix and miluakee. People are forgetting they were insane last year
You're right if Jaylen Brown and Mike Conley were healthy everything would have been different

"Steph Curry, 25  IT, 26  Kemba, 26  Oladipo, 25  Mike Conley, 33  Chauncey Billups, 29  I'm not saying Lonzo is exactly like any of these guys, but there are a lot of successful players whose ceiling isn't established at 23. If you come into the league at 22 we should know who you are by your third season. If you come in at 19, then we shouldn't be surprised if you're still finding your game in the first 3 years that would've been college in a different era. Guys like Luka and Trae who clearly show they have HOF potential at 20-21 are the outliers."
"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"SF's had the better talent at the top but PG was the deepest by far. Steph, Dame, Russ, Kyrie, CP3, Drose, John Wall, Mike Conley, Isiah Thomas, even Deron Williams was still good back then."
"Mike Conley, MJ, Michael Cooper, Michael Finley, Michael Porter Jr"
"They only played together for one game on February 24th, 2009 in which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers 94-79....  But imagine a Mike Conley and Adonal Foyle hybrid.   So much charity. The altruism would be off the charts. World hunger would be a thing of the past and universal goodwill towards all humans would be the norm."
Mike Conley
"Mike Conley, he has played the most career games without a tech."
Also mike Conley being injured played into the standard Donovan Mitchell hero ball mentality that has cost them in every playoffs
Kevin Durant lost to Mike Conley.
Mike Conley made his first All-Star appearance this year.  33 I think?  Maybe 32 during the All-Star break.

Also, you've got the next generation of superstars in Trae Young, Tatum, Zion, Donovan Mitchell; then there's the class of guys who used to be elite and might be especially tempted to juice to battle the effects of injury or general decline: Kemba, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, K-Love, John Wall, Mike Conley, Gordon Hayward, and Dwight Howard.

"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"Bruh everyone was calling Mitchell injured. It was obvious his very first game of the Memphis series that he wasn't himself and it just got worse as the Playoffs progressed. That's what made his playoff performances so impressive... he was dropping 37 on one leg. They also didn't have Mike Conley. Any team would struggle to beat the Clippers without two All-Stars and a completely beat up backcourt.   Also, it's comical how you knock the Jazz for relying on Conley when several teams above Utah also have old point guards. Conley is 33, Westbrook is 32, Chris Paul is 36, LeBron James is 36, Steph Curry is 33... the list could continue. To further the point, the Jazz really don't rely on Conley that much. He largely plays off the ball and doesn't have to play too many minutes. He's a great player, and very helpful to have, but the weight of reliance falls entirely on Gobert's and Mitchell's shoulders.   Regardless, put the Jazz at 9th and you'll look like a clown when the season ends. They just came off the league's best record, kept the main core and heavily upgraded their bench. Utah is a good team but keep sleeping"
KD isn’t as impressive as he was a clear number 2 but he could picked al Horford or mike Conley as well at 3 and 4.
Mike Conley isn’t a bench player
When was Mike Conley on the bench?
Chandler Parsons was up there. Maybe Mike Conley too
Healthy Mike Conley is a myth unfortunately
That Mike Conley defense though. Might as well not even be there
[Not actually the first time Mike's been threatened into re-signing with his team](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2016/04/29/tony-allen-warns-mike-conley-if-i-see-you-in-new-york-or-one-of-them-places-you-got-a-flagrant-foul-coming/)
Mike Conley
"ESPN: Mike Conley was ""fearful for his life"" during contract negotiations, fueling concerns about the Jazz."
"Mike Conley, good thing Utah got a steal in Jared Butler"
"Mike Conley, look at that injury history"
Kawhi  PG13  Dame  Donavon Mitchell  Russ  Ja Morant  Kyrie  Derozan  Bradley Beal  Dejounte Murray  Keldon Johnson   Giannis  Patty Mills  Blake Griffin   Reggie Jackson  Oladipo  Sabonis  Bojan Bogdonavich  Mike Conley   Jimmy Butler  Rudy Gay
Wilt was a track and field guy too. They train for long jumps and high jumps. Mike Conley sr. Had one of the cleanest FT line dunks
"[Mike Conley did it as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZz6qJvbrgY), Wilt was over 7ft tall with a 7'8 wingspan and freakish athleticism. I don't think it's impossible that he could do it."
"Mike Conley senior dunked from a few inches behind the free throw line and he was only 6'1"". A legit 7 footer with a monster wingspan with the same jumping ability could theoretically do it with less momentum."
"I wouldn’t compare him to Melo. As you said, totally different players for one. Second though, Kidd started almost every game that season and played like 33-34 minutes per game; Melo only started 3 last year on 24 minutes a game.   I’d feel more comfortable comparing him to maybe Mike Conley (though Conley definitely is a better scorer than a 37 year old Kidd). I’m not sure there really are a lot of great comparisons in the league right now. Ricky Rubio lines up a lot closer stat-wise."
Bruce makes Grayson Allen look like Mike Conley
"In a very, very roundabout way, Grayson Allen getting picked (because of course he did) was a trade piece for Mike Conley."
Mike Conley ain't gonna be worth that in 2 years oof
"It's always fun to have picked up a guy the season right before he really becomes a massive fantasy player.   I got lucky one year with late picks Roy Hibbert, Mike Conley and Wes Matthews, and then picked up Paul George from FA all on the same team when they were all mid round guys averaging like 12 ppg and my team just ran away with the league."
"Had a great year in Phx. Building to something really great in the bubble. Traded for Chris Paul.  The year before that he was finding his place with the Jazz. Started his Ricky Rubio Foundation there. Was replaced by Mike Conley.  Getting replaced by older vets while you're in your prime and looking to be a vital part of a team has to be doing things to your head. Ricky is all about mental health and head space. He obviously wasn't in the right place when he came back to Minny. By the time he settled in, it was clear that the Wolves weren't looking for a playoff spot and focused on building younger talent like Ant and Jaden McDaniels. So that's what Ricky's role came to be. He was shooting much better during the 2nd half of the season. Ant had been speaking highly of him as a vet."
"A big part of it is Mike Conley playing more than four games in a row without injury. If the Jazz can have another good regular season, they might develop some of their less crucial pieces into trade pieces worth more than their contracts.  For me I can't see them getting over the hump when every back up centre they sign is Rudy lite. They need a scoring backup that can punish the small ball line ups like the clippers used on you in the finals."
"&gt;I'm a bit confused by how low the # of all defensive teams is for iggy  Dave Berri showed, I believe in ""The Wages of Wins,"" how a players votes for defensive awards went up as their scoring did. Basically, the best way to get more defensive awards votes was to score more.   It also hurts Iguodala's case that two things seem to drive the public perception of defense:  1) On-ball perimeter defense, delivered with attitude.   2) Emphatic blocks, even if they go out of bounds.   Iguodala's great at on-ball perimeter defense, but what makes him a head-and-shoulders better defender than Tony Allen, Avery Bradley, John Wall, or Mike Conley (the guys who landed all-defense spots above him) was this preternatural ability to break up an offensive set off ball. He had a near-unique ability to anticipate a key pass, and simply move ahead of the play in a way that the pass was never even attempted, and the offense had to reset.  The value of something like that was something you had to watch him to see, especially because until 2015 or so awards voters tended to scoff at analytics.   Also, Kobe deserved many of his defensive accolades, but his all-defensive picks in '11 and '12 were absurd - entirely based on reputation and not what he was actually doing on the floor. There were some great posts on Silver Screen and Roll - a Lakers fan blog - breaking down just how awful his defense was in that period).   In my opinion, Iguodala is one of the most criminally underrated players of the past 30 years. We have four examples (Iguodala leaving Philly, arriving in Denver, leaving Denver, arriving in Golden State) which suggest that Iguodala's presence was worth 10-15 spots in the team defensive rankings. That's unheard of for a perimeter player."
"I am yoking  Jrue Holiday was the poster child answer for this for years, only Mike Conley is the bigger example of this, the most overrated underrated player in NBA history when he was in Memphis"
"Yes it was, people underestimate what Mike Conley can do for Rudy. As great as Joe and Donovan, they cant lob it to Rudy as well as Conley. His injury was why Utah lost."
Hmm what if Mike Conley joins team USA and wins gold. That would be father/son winning in 2 different sports.
This was far from the best team the USA could have fielded. The following are 2021 NBA All-Stars who weren't on the team.  Starters:  Bradley Beal  Kyrie Irving  Stephen Curry  LeBron James  Kawhi Leonard  Others:  Jaylen Brown  James Harden  Julius Randle  Mike Conley Jr.  Brandon Ingram  Donovan Mitchell  Chris Paul  Anthony Davis  Paul George  Zion Williamson
No? He was traded to get Mike Conley. He was in the trade because he is a good bench guy.
"One of my favorite players right there, Mike Conley"
Second time this offseason Shams gets shit on. Woj had to correct him on his Mike Conley numbers too.
"As the triplets left Arkansas, Mike Conley (Sr.) came to Arkansas to dominate track and field- but dude was a baller. He won a Footlocker celebrity dunk contest 3 different times in the 80s"
"I mean, I'm just giving my perspective as a neutral fan. The talent level of these finals was lower than years past. Each team got to the finals fair and square, however sometimes the NBA is a game of attrition. Injuries to AD, Jaylen Brown, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Kawhi, Kyrie, Harden, and to a lesser extent Trae, Giannis, and CP3 made these playoffs not as interesting.  That being said this is coming from a fan whose team didn't make the playoffs so I'm purely neutral"
"No worries, [Conley made the same mistake when we first traded for him] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.slcdunk.com/platform/amp/utah-jazz-social-media-take-note/2019/6/20/18692588/nba-trade-mike-conley-accidentally-says-city-of-utah-jazz-donovan-mitchell)"
Deserved All Star over Mike Conley and Devin Booker last year at the time of voting.
"Deron Williams, Mike Conley, and Ricky Green.   Can't think of any other good Jazz point guard.  J/k  Stockton, D-Will, Conley"
Bibby was Mike Conley before Mike Conley. He's sweet as hell
Monte is only starting because Murray is hurt. Smart will probably be the PG in Boston and he’s better than D’Lo. Dude you’re struggling for 9 guys it’s ok to admit D’Lo is in the back 1/3rd of starters.   Also no way is he better than Mike Conley the starting point guard for the 1 seed in the west last year.
"Mike Conley in a big market in the east could've been an All-Star a lot sooner. Also he's more ""the guy"" in terms of carrying a team thab Lonzo."
"It took multiple injury replacements, being on the best team record wise in the league, and still having good stats for Mike Conley to make it.  Unless you think a team will build around Lonzo to allow him to have better stats or he’ll play for a great team that he’s a vital piece of and has some injury luck, I doubt he makes it. Maybe if he goes to the east."
still time to improve honestly. i can see him being a fringe all-star or maybe a substitute all-star. let's say as mike conley in terms of all-star status
Mike Conley is the only all-star for the Jazz
"Mike Conley has played 886 career games and 28,561 total minutes and hasn’t recorded a single technical foul. He was issued one tech, in 2014 against the Kings, but it was rescinded by the league. It’s absurd someone with such a lengthy career with a crazy high usage percentage has never gotten a tech."
That Mike Conley Sr. dunk from just inside the FT line with BOTH HANDS and serious authority 👀
"NBA contracts are grossly inflated. If Mike Conley is making over 25 million a year, Ben Simmons will easily get 30+ million a year."
A) Chris Paul  B) Mike Conley  C) Kyle Lowry  D) Jrue Holiday
"Let me guess:  &gt;!Player A: Chris Paul!&lt;  &gt;!Player B: Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley!&lt;  &gt;!Player C: (I had to google for this one so no submission, got it wrong.)!&lt;  &gt;!Player D: Jrue Holiday!&lt;  &amp;#x200B;  My ranking before knowing who it is:  A, B, D, C  My ranking after knowing who it is:  A, D, C, B"
"But it would take way more than Donovan Mitchell is my point. They're a contender because they got Gobert at 27th overall. For good but not great teams that draft outside the lottery it's incredibly hard to find those difference makers. There might only be 1 all-star outside the lottery in a given year and there are lots of teams picking. Well run teams find and develop those players more often than poorly run teams for sure, as a Raps fan I see that firsthand almost every year but even with all that turning the team into a Brooklyn or LA level contender is really difficult because you end up having to find a big-time talent either in the 20s or the 2nd round and some years there might not even be one. Like people shit on Portland for not building a contender around Dame without really acknowledging that it's pretty hard, they weren't some incompetent front office, they picked CJ with the highest pick they had during Dame's tenure and then it's hard to see what the path to contention was beyond what they've already experienced. I would look at Portland as an example of a small market team that was pretty well run but never got that luck that they needed. You can't expect a front office to nail every single pick no matter how good they are so barring that it's hard to see how they could have gotten there. So many things have to go right that are out of that team's control. If the Raps traded for Kawhi these days they would be giving up Siakam, OG and then probably like 4 picks and swaps, not winning because they gave up pieces and then having no future after Kawhi leaves. I'm not saying rules need to change or something this is just the reality of team building without big name free agents but I just don't like players signing long term getting all their money and then just demanding a trade. And the Zion stuff is annoying because how can you expect a team to go from drafting 1st overall to a contender in like two years. I guess my point is that you can get the Donovan Mitchell type or the Siakam type that turn your team into a playoff team but getting from there to a championship is incredibly difficult. That all-star you drafted has to be like a top 10 player which are hard to find or you have to find a similar caliber player outside the lottery. Utah is a great example. They have basically done everything right, they drafted an all star in the lottery, they found an all NBA player outside the lottery, they found an elite role player in Joe Ingles and acquired a nice complimentary piece in Mike Conley and yet here they are just a 2nd round out. That's why it's hard because you can do everything right and still not really even come that close if you don't get the opportunity to sign or trade for top players."
"While I do think run and gun was always the future (GMs stating so, stat nerds pushing for it), there's no way Oden would've gone the way of Hibbert.  If Giannis can have a tremendous career playing like how he has, especially in this past Finals (with Ayton in the middle, mind you), Oden could easily replicate his own version.  Remove Embiid and Jokic's three point shooting and they're still very effective players who you can't stop down low.  Lebron without a jumper is still Lebron (not like he relies on that jumper).  Otherwise, Oden had pretty good FT% for a big man and was working on a jumper before his injury.  The guy was faster than KD at the combine, had handles on par with Mike Conley, had an incredibly high vertical for a big man, could pass out of doubles, and had natural strength on par with prime Dwight Howard.  Run and gun is great for role players and star guards but I think you've just forgotten how an elite big man actually looks that you're mistaking them for random centers."
"Quite a bit of a difference in that one. Mike Conley is a 1x all-star reserve with no defensive accolades and no all-nba. Ben Simmons is a 3x all-star, 2x all-defense, and 1x all-nba while also being a DPOY candidate.  C'mon son."
Mike Conley out here catching strays.
Mike Conley is max and all star too. Ben Simmons is def not a top 25 player.
"Yes, [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/HjP1YCU59Q3mZ1o97)is him and Mike Conley in high school. Mike looks like he’s 25 and Oden looks like he’s 40. This is also the youngest I’ve ever seen him look too, most other high school pics look way worse."
"Thats a really tough decision. I mean Mike is definitely a better 3 point shooter but Tobias is also better in the mid range and the post. Their defense is about the same level from what I’ve seen, so i’d prolly sign depending on fit.   If I was the Sixers, i’d definitely take Tobias since i already have Simmons at pg. If i were someone like the Knicks maybe, I’d take Conley so i wouldnt have to play DRose for 40+ mins."
"Recent all-stars I definitely prefer Ben Simmons to:  Kemba Walker, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Domantas Sabonis, Khris Middleton, Russell Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, Julius Randle, Nik Vucevic, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell"
"Avoiding Star players here—-  Watch: TJ McConnell, Harrison Barnes, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart  Don’t Watch: Malik Monk, Aron Baynes, Eric Bledsoe"
"Mike Conley  Patty Mills  Jrue Holiday  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Boban Marjanovic  Is your list a joke OP? Derrick Rose said some kind of messed up stuff at a trial, Steven Adams has been voted one of the dirtiest players in the league, Bobby Portis punched a teammate, and a lot of people don't like how much Luka Doncic complains about calls."
Didn't Mike Conley make the all star team off strong defensive performance? Or are you just talking about the playoffs for which Mike was injured?
"You're going to need a team of elite defenders and consistent scorers who can drill 3s and penetrate to the rim. You'd almost certainly need to pick an elite playmaker and a top tier defender.   I'd choose KD, Curry, Klay, Draymond, with DeAndre Ayton at center  For the bench I'd go with Mike Conley, Buddy Hield, Covington,  OG Anoubly, Capela, Joe Ingles, Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Fred VanVleet, Tobias Harris  Maybe throw in PJ Tucker instead of a big for a death lineup of Curry, Klay, KD, PJ, Draymond and just destroy teams offensively and defensively with intensity."
Marc Gasol   Mike Conley   Rudy Gay   Ja Morant   JJJ  Dillon Brooks   Desmond Bane   Kyle Anderson   Deanthony Melton   Brandon Clarke   Xavier Tillman   Ziaire Williams
"Ain’t no probably chief. They needed Mike Conley desperately, Reggie Jackson looked like an all NBA player against them."
"2 different players and different roles.  Marc was a legit lockdown in the paint (won the DPOY) and would absolutely bang on the glass. He could score on the inside and pop out later in his career. Never really viewed as a big time scorer but would get you 10+ a night regardless. His biggest value was defense in the paint, rebounding, and an above average passer which was helped by having solid team chemistry with players whom he played with for several year (notably Mike Conley)   Pau was a scorer with a ton of moves stemming from very strong footwork for a 7’. He had an incredible touch on his shots and knew to play with the backboard like Duncan. He could handle the ball a bit and was a very strong passer on the interior. It certainly helped playing alongside bigs in LA like Bynum and Odom who also knew what to do with the ball, lots of touch pass assists. Kobe drawing away any doubles from Pau made him even better.  Defensively Pau would put his arms up and hope for the best, not bad but not great."
"I think this has never occurred for us. The closest might be Mike Conley in his first year here, but the relationship was not contentious; Grizzlies fans are honestly some of the kindest people in this country."
LeBron is the obvious one but Mike Conley is probably the most ambidextrous player ever. He shoots left but swear he can do everything woth both
"Ah for sure, my memory is not as good so you may be right. Still counts though imo, just like Mike Conley"
So he’s like Mike Conley
The one true point guard the jazz have is Mike Conley who was out the entire clippers series if he’s healthy gobert can be much more involved offensively.
Mike Conley essentially was playing like one before he got hurt this year. You can say he’s not but he was balling out of his mind before the all star break.
Mike Conley  He always gets missed in the best PG conversations even though he was an AS in the West last season.   And his injury during the playoffs last season is basically forgotten about when discussing who was injured in the playoffs
"It's the ""advanced stats"" people who also think Mike Conley is a borderline All-NBA player"
"Yes. Now he is paid about the same money as ""guys worth that money"" like Buddy Hield, Mike Conley, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Goran Dragic, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Al Horford.   10 million less than Kristaps, Blake, Pascal, Wiggins, Kevin Love, McCollum, D'Lo, and Gordon Hayward.  Obviously some of these are overpays but market value for a 25 year old who is really good at one thing, and can be made better at the others? 22m a year is probably what standard looks like."
"As a Mike Conley stan, I've encountered some Mike Conley haters. Especially around the time he signed that extension with Memphis."
"You're telling me, gun to your head, you wouldn't pick Mike Conley over Kevin Durant? Madness."
Mike Conley is good enough to be liked by everyone but also not good enough to have any real haters.
Actually Mike Conley is a good answer.
"I dont know if he is universally beloved, but I cant imagine anyone disliking Mike Conley. Maybe serial killers."
Mike Conley or Jrue Holiday.

Mike Conley a bust after his second year.
I saw that god damn trade suggested for Mike Conley/Marc Gasol every god damn day in /r/MemphisGrizzlies
Mike Conley wasn’t bad
How about if the Nets were healthy? I am a lifer Jazz fan and straight up the Jazz got their asses HARD exploited on their over-reliance on Rudy. It happened last year too. It would have happened if Mike Conley was healthy the entire series.
"Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Chris Paul are all better than Kyrie now, and always have been.  Ky isn't good enough to be a number 1 option on a championship team and his game isn't suited to being a number 2 option (He isn't active off-ball, has negative impact defensively and doesn't shoot well off the catch.)"
"Man, Mitchell really thinks Mike Conley makes a bigger difference than Kawhi Leonard."
Donovan is an above average defender when healthy. Same for mike Conley but they were both injured in the playoffs
That was half of Mike Conley
How is it not valid? Mike Conley looked like he couldn't even move out there. Like he couldn't even properly catch the ball
his point is that they were injured too- his ankle was clearly getting worse through that series and mike conley was out except for game 6 where he was clearly hamstringed  would them being healthy be enough to beat the healthy clips suns and bucks?  no idea but he should have that confidence
iirc mike conley wanted to play with parsons and memphis had to offer that in order to retain conley
Mike Conley and ZBo &gt;
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De’Aaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I’d rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D’Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
Honestly I just wanna say how much I love Mike Conley being an honorable mention lmfao
"What? So if you’re in an especially rough conference you’re not all star level ? Whether you get an extra 100 votes for all star determines how good you are as a player ? By that logic Roy Hibbert, Mike Conley and goran Dragic are better co stars than CJ, Fox, Shai, Ja, etc   Ignoring that criteria, again CJ has outplayed or matched dames play in like half their shared series..."
Mike Conley no longer on this list 🥰
A defensive oriented team surrounding 2015-16 Steph with DPOY Marc Gasol and Mike Conley possibly moving to SG sounds filthy
You just said mike Conley did that in Memphis? Because last time I checked conleys grizzlies had no spacing so now I know you don’t know what your talking about.
Tony Allen and Mike conley both got hurt after leading 2-1 in that Memphis series. And they don’t compare in the slightest to the 04 pistons  Just saying this is the same team that beat kobe and shaq in the finals. They deserve a bit more respect
Mike Conley can to all of that. He did for years in Memphis and that team was more successful than the Jazz. The Jazz could easily go grit and grind and be semi successful without mitchell. They don't even make the playoffs without Gobert. The only reason they are an elite team is because of their defense.
"Kyle Lowry, see Mike Conley  And Monta have it all"
Mike Conley in literally anything. Man is a perennial snub for his career.
"I feel like the Bulls should be considered a rebuild because 3/5 of their starters were acquired in the last year? And they replaced their coach - this seems like a rebuild to me.   Grizzlies are the definition of a rebuild - got rid of their two franchise players Marc Gasol and Mike Conley in 2019, and have drafted a solid young core which was the 9th seed in 2020 and the 8th seed in 2021. If you get rid of your franchise players and start building around a young star that is the definition of a rebuild - and they’ve had more success than the Cavs in a harder conference.   Thanks for agreeing on the Wolves. Their core has only played like 10 games with the 3 of them.   I look forward to seeing what the Cavs can do, but feel like you have a lot of issues still? Coach got replaced, Love is still useless/looking to get bought out, Jarrett Allen is paid 100m over 5 but your high potential draft pick plays the same position? And Garland and Sexton also kind of do? I think you have nice pieces to trade, your team just needs to make some tough decisions. Ben Simmons would be good on your team tho."
"&gt; but not otherwordly  But they were otherworldly lol. He was literally the first player in NCAA history in scoring and assists and did it as a freshman, on top of having the highest-scoring freshman season ever at a Power 5 school, and he did it on great efficiency.   &gt;Again, you can look at Steph as a comparion. Steph is small but is actually taller and longer than Trae. And his efficiency and advanced stats in college were significantly better than Trae.  How about looking at De'Aaron Fox, D'Angelo Russell, Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley, etc.  Even if you want to die on the hill of comparing Trae to the college career of the GOAT shooter:  Steph's freshman year he put up 21.5/4.6/2.8 on 61.7% TS in the Southern Conference against a -2.26 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year he put up 27.4/3.9/8.7 on 58.5% TS in the Big 12 against a 10.56 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year was still more impressive when you contextualize it.   &gt;but taking a guy like Steph is still a gamble.  This is a moronic take."
If he played all 4 years which of course would not have happened he would’ve been on the Greg Oden-Mike Conley OSU team that made the finals.
He’s probably a little worse than mike Conley. Borderline all star that excelled at scoring but isn’t good enough to put a team over the edge.
We’d never trade them for this because Bojan and Mike are too valuable but  Bojan + Mike Conley and a first round pick   76ers give us  Ben Simmons and Maxey
"Mike Conley, Jordan Clarkson and 2 first rounders and a few 2nd rounders"
Broken face Mike Conley
main reason they lost is Mike Conley was hurt and couldn't stay in front of his man or contribute on offense.  the guy posted a -3.9 gamescore.  +10 is supposed to be average.
"father time remains undefeated  applies to the Lakers, and also to the Jazz (Mike Conley has dealt with injuries just about every year and isn't getting any younger)"
Mike Conley wasn’t available for game 1 and Tony Allen missed game 5 (correct me if I’m wrong on that). Healthy Memphis would have won that series.
"That’s pretty interesting. I love Conley at this point, but as a fan of those Grit and Grind teams in Memphis, it seemed they were always hoping that Conley could make a big jump to super stardom. It kind of reminds me of Ben Simmons now (although Mike Conley was never really disliked), but so far as it was an era whose success was dictated (at least as the media portrayed) by the improvement of one player. You knew what you were getting with Gasol, Randolph and Allen, but it always felt like they were one perimeter player away. If I’m being fair, Rudy Gay was even less consistent, but he was known to be inefficient even then.   I always think of that era as pretty fun to watch based on how different they were from good three point shooting teams like GSW and the Spurs. I know this is a total tangent, but unless the Sixers figure something out, I feel like I am going to look back at the Embiid dominant Sixers similarly. Just an inch away.   Going back to the original discussion. I forget how old Lowry is given the fact he did spend all those years with the Rockets."
It’s interesting. I’m much better at understanding the advanced stats of bigs as opposed to guards. I imagine Mike Conley is another guy for whom the analytics guys love.
"Joakim noah was a top 5 mvp convo, then fell off  also mike conley, think about the new gen 10 years from now  ""Who were the best western conference guards during the 2010s""   No one will be naming him, or even z-bo"
"Mike Conley, I already kinda forget he exists sometimes."
Are you kidding me! Mike Conley injuries and overall depth of point guard in the Association prevented one or two more additional All-Star appearances by him. Conley is a traditional NBA point guard.
"So many players get forgotten. Look at random all star rosters from the 90s and each one has a guy or two that makes you go ""oh yeah, that guy was pretty good, forgot about him"".    So like, Mike Conley will be forgotten by non-memphis fans. Jrue Holiday will probably be forgotten. Even someone as good as Beal, if he never moves teams, nobody outside the DMV will have any idea who he was in like 2046."
Prime Mike Conley tho
"  Wariors advance to first West finals since '76 after closing out Grizzlies  MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Stephen Curry practices tough shots every day. The MVP came up with a third-quarter buzzer-beater his coach calls the play of the game. For Golden State, rank it among the Warriors' best shots in decades, and it helped put them in their first Western Conference finals since 1976.  Curry scored 32 points with that 62-footer among eight 3-pointers, and the Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies a third straight game, 108-95, on Friday night.  ""In a closeout game like that, that's a big turning point and the moment's magnified,"" said Curry, the NBA's MVP. ""I made one in college like that. That's the last I made anywhere past half court and same kind of shot: loose ball, grab it, throw it up and knock it down."" First-year coach Steve Kerr called this a beautiful team win and a big moment for the Warriors. He said Curry was amazing, especially with that shot as the Grizzlies tried to make a run in the third quarter. ""It wasn't quite a closeout shot, but it was the play of the game,"" Kerr said. The Warriors advanced with some of the best shooting in the NBA postseason since 1985, becoming the first team since that year to hit 14 or more 3s in three consecutive playoff games. Curry was 8-of-13 from beyond the arc as the Warriors knocked down their playoff-best 15 3-pointers. Curry, who had 10 assists for his first double-double this postseason, hit the shot of the night after Andre Iguodala blocked Jeff Green's shot near midcourt. Curry grabbed the loose ball and beat the buzzer from the Grizzlies' 3-point line for a 76-68 lead. Klay Thompson had 20 points for Golden State, and Draymond Green added 16, Harrison Barnes 13 and Shaun Livingston 10. Memphis coach Dave Joerger said he hadn't seen the replay of Curry's shot. Grizzlies guard Mike Conley said he thought Green was fouled and that his teammates stopped playing, waiting for the call, and then Curry threw up the shot. ""It was tough to realize and kind of grasp it all in the same time,"" Conley said. The Warriors will play the winner of the Los Angeles Clippers-Houston Rockets series in the conference finals. That series will start Tuesday night at Golden State. Curry says the opponent does not matter. ""We'll obviously be watching on Sunday to figure it out,"" Curry said of the Clippers-Rockets Game 7. ""I feel like if we do what we're supposed to do in the next round, we'll be all right."" Marc Gasol led Memphis with 21 points and 15 rebounds. Vince Carter added 16 off the bench, Zach Randolph had 15, Courtney Lee 12 and Conley 11. Curry finished the series with 25 3-pointers, one more than the Grizzlies managed as a team. When he beat the buzzer with that long 3, he celebrated by bumping chests with Iguodala and David Lee. He then added 11 points in the fourth quarter to finish off the Grizzlies. ""It's just one of those special moments,"" Grizzlies guard Tony Allen said of Curry. ""He's a special kind of guy. They make those kind of shots."" That stellar shooting helped the Warriors win a second series in the same postseason for the first time since capturing the title in 1975, and they never trailed in this game. The Warriors outshot, outrebounded and simply did everything better than Memphis early, looking like the team that dominated the NBA regular season. Golden State led 32-19 by the end of the first quarter and Memphis had one more field goal (seven) than the Warriors had 3-pointers (six). The ""Splash Brothers"" outscored the Grizzlies by themselves, combining for 22 points. But Curry and Thompson got plenty of help with teammates taking turns knocking down shots. ""I think what you see with their team is I think that they really grew up,"" Joerger said. ""They really grew through the battle of this series and matured to the point where I think that will help them, unfortunately, in the future being able to take the hits that they took and the physicality that I think we are known for."" Memphis tried to rally, opening the third quarter with a 13-5 spurt with two free throws by Green pulling the Grizzlies within 63-62 with 3:59 left. Green hit a jumper to get them within 65-64 before the Warriors finished the quarter on an 11-4 run capped by Curry's amazing 3. Memphis got within eight with 6:03 left and got no closer as Curry knocked down consecutive 3s. --- TIP-INS  Warriors: Curry had been 0-for-32, 0-of-3 in the playoffs, on shots from the backcourt before his 62-footer. ... The Warriors are 13-7 all time in Game 6s and improved to 9-2 in their past 11. ... They are 54-5 this season and postseason combined when making at least 10 3-pointers, including 7-0 these playoffs. Grizzlies: Allen, who had 24 steals in his first nine playoff games, tried to play with the injured left hamstring that kept him out of Game 5. But he played only 5 minutes before going to the bench for the night, unable to move effectively. ... Memphis had only three turnovers, the fewest ever in a playoff game against Golden State. The Lakers had six on March 31, 1969, against Golden State. ... Memphis is 4-2 all time in Game 6s, losing its past two. REMEMBERING B.B. The Grizzlies played a video tribute and held a moment of silence before the national anthem in memory of musician B.B. King, who died late Thursday at the age of 89. King got his nickname early in his career playing live in Memphis as the ""Beale Street Blues Boy,"" which later was shortened to B.B."
"LOL DDR was 11th in overall assists last season &amp; 12th in APG.  He averaged &amp; tallied more assists than premier NBA PGs, such as Ben Simmons, Brogdon, &amp; Mike Conley....  do you not watch him play?  he's literally one of the best distributing forwards in basketball...  On a team where he's the 2nd or 3rd best player, he is going to thrive like no one will believe"
"The interesting thing about the Pelicans is we had a different owner when CP3 was there, but he didn't really want to invest and lose money and wanted out of the NBA. But even thought that was another owner, it becomes New Orleans just waste players.       And AD and Zion are under the Bensons and they own a lot for wasting AD.      It's too early to say much of OKC's rebuild.    San Antonio had no culture before they won in '99 during lockout year. Then they almost lost all that in 2001 when Duncan was ready to walk. Culture didn't stop Kawhi from leaving.    Memphis has had #2, #4 picks in last 4 years. Their picks have been garbage for years even when they had them.    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis\_Grizzlies\_draft\_history#:\~:text=Selections%20%20%20%20draft%20%20%20,%20Mississippi%20State%20%2032%20more%20rows%20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies_draft_history#:~:text=Selections%20%20%20%20draft%20%20%20,%20Mississippi%20State%20%2032%20more%20rows%20)     Memphis' biggest luck has been they got Marc Gasol and Mike Conley, two underhyped guys that didn't crave the spotlight or stardom and had low-key personalities. It's easier to keep and grind it out it in the second round of the playoffs with mid-tier players. Ask Toronto, Denver, Utah (in 1990s) Obviously absurd, but arguement could be made Pelicans should probably trade Zion and go for players under long-term contracts that are more suited for small market teams like Tim Duncan was for Spurs."
"If lots think he's underrated, it's the Mike Conley/Jrue effect"
"Mike Conley, Sr. was literally an Olympic level leaper, and I love this stunt. In defense of NBA players, though, never dribbling does make it easier. Also, I suspect that’s not a regulation sized NBA basketball he’s palming with one hand so easily."
none that include the mike conley dunk
"How have you watched the league the last 4 years and not understood by now that the cap is mostly imaginary. You can move any money for any money mostly at any time unless you're wildly over the salary cap.   How many of the ""worst deals around the league"" have moved just in the last 2 or 3 offseasons? Because off the top of my head i can count John Wall, Kemba Walker, Mike Conley, Al Horford, Russell Westbrook twice, Chris Paul twice, Andrew Wiggins, Marc Gasol, Kristaps Porzingis and I'm probably forgetting a good number.  And we can say anything we want about Ben Simmons in the playoffs or about his mental fortitude, whatever. He is at worst the 40th-50th best player in the league. At worst. His athleticism, build and skillset on defense make him uniquely valuable in raising the floor of a team in a way not many guys in the league can do, and said skillset fills a lot of holes for Minnesota. And the kicker is he's coming at the lowest cost he could possibly come at. Based on current valuation I'd say Ben Simmons is the highest upside bad contract in the league. By a country mile. Acquiring Ben Simmons does more for Minnesota at this juncture then any free agent they could hypothetically sign within the next couple offseasons because they're scheduled to be past the cap til '23 anyways. So this penny pinching really overall is so needless. The Wolves need talent. Go and get talent that's available at an all time low asset cost. This isn't rocket science.  Sincerely, Dumbass"
"We’re just gonna agree to disagree, you just don’t understand how famous those 4 are in this city.  The franchise is literally young as fuck so obviously first time success it’s super important.  I’m 25 and for my generation of Memphians those 4 guys are our heroes.  Personally Mike Conley is one my biggest hero’s, it’s more to it than accolades, hell what they did off the court was so impactful being comprehension to the Memphis community."
"A fourth option averaging that is insane kid. I’m sorry but if your fourth option is a mike Conley/jrue holiday level guard you’re stupidly stacked. Why not go through contenders for the past decade and see how many teams you can list where their fourth option is averaging two steals, 8 assist and double digit points. I promise you that list will be very small   No you’re a hater because you’re purposely trying to discredit lebrons competition so you can bash him."
Rondo was averaging 11/8/5 with 2 steals a game and great defense as the fourth best player on the team. That’s like having jrue holiday or mike Conley  as your fourth option lol  This is real rich coming from a hater lol
"Oh absolutely. Somehow we were making it work before TA went down, but Mike not having a busted face would have helped too. Steph and Klay just had an open season on us afterwards.  Conley playing in that face mask is still one of the gutsiest things I've ever seen in sports."
So you wouldn't call Mike Conley a star until last year when he made the all-star after a drop out?
"Lol so Mike Conley deserved to make the all star game over fox? He should’ve been an all star last year, it is what it is. Shit I wouldn’t have minded if SGA made it over Conley."
[Conley is also getting his retired](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/grizzlies-thank-mike-conley-for-contributions-to-franchise-announce-plan-to-retire-his-jersey/)

Yep.  Here's the Gasol announcement: https://www.nba.com/grizzlies/news/memphis-grizzlies-release-statement-on-marc-gasol-190208  Here's the Conley announcement: https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/sports/nba/grizzlies/2019/07/06/memphis-grizzlies-mike-conley-trade-retire-jersey-nba-utah-jazz/1664802001/
"It's inaccurate to say that all we know of rookies is their statlines. James Harden had significantly better signs of isolation scoring and three-point creation, was stronger and had much better athleticism, and showed signs of making tough execution passes both in transition and in the halfcourt. He also only played 22 minutes in 0 starts where Haliburton played 30, so tossing his statline out there without adjusting for minutes played is misleading.  Haliburton's stats mostly came off good secondary role execution. Lots of spot-up threes, some good passing to cutters and rollers, some but not a huge amount of playmaking in transition, very few isolation attempts, very little self-creation, and the creation for others was limited in its depth (e.g., does not have the speed to consistently create off a drive/kick). Not a great point of attack defender and sometimes finds himself out of position.  When you view the game film, it's not nonsensical. It's a whole years worth of footage showing what he's good at and what he has potential in. His skillset (i.e. skillset, not potential) is moreso Malcolm Brogdon than James Harden or Luka Doncic. Maybe someone like Mike Conley if he puts it together really well defensively. Again, easily a top 5 player in this class. But if it's not fair to say his upside is limited, it's not fair to assume - as everyone seems to be - that he's already an all-star/all-NBA lock. It's a just a little pre-emptive."
It's not black and white man. Defenders guard Steph tighter from behind the perimeter than they do for Mike Conley. That doesn't mean Conley is a bad shooter. Having a center who shoots that well from beyond the arc means the other teams big HAS to press up on him at the 3 pt line and give him no space.
"Curry faced every single 1st team All NBA player in 2015. AD, Gasol, LeBron and Harden. Just because he didn't face Jrue Holiday or Mike Conley doesn't mean he had an easy ring lol"
"none of those guys drive to the paint then kick it out like Russ and LeBron, also Mike Conley wasn’t leaving the Jazz he loves it there and they gave him a ton of money"
"yeah russ is a monster when he's on his game but other guys are maybe more complete guards who shoot better and play better defense  they could have gone after dinwiddie or mike conley, or lonzo, or brogdon.   those guys would have been pretty easy to get  a harder thing would be to try and swing a trade for a de'aaron fox kind of player."
"Mike Conley, Marc Gasol"
"Been here for a minute. Fuck sentiment, he shoulda been all-star over Mike Conley last season."
"It’s probably overused in Jazz circles, but screening (and especially screening well) is an important part of the game. A huge reason Conley had his career best year in both 3pt% and attempts was Rudy’s screens. Over and over Rudy would screen and re-screen Conley’s defender and get Mike absolutely wide open for an easy look without having to make a single pass. Nothing’s recorded on the box score for Rudy, but Gobert definitely has an unusually good ability to get his teammates quality looks.  Screen assists have a lot of subjectivity to them (as do regular assists) and shouldn’t be taken as gospel, but I think it’s a step in the right direction in understanding that there’s things a player can do besides get points/assists/rebounds/steals/blocks that can help their team win."
"There are limited AllStar spots, almost every season ever several players equally deserving of the spot get left off. If ypu have 30 players of that level and only 24 can get that label that particular year, that doesn't mean the other 6 are not as good (or better in some cases). Like Mike Conley for example, he didn't magically become AllStar level good last year, he was that good and even better all his career, he just never made it. Also, AllStar is a popularity contest as much as it's a recognition of skill, so always take selections with a grain of salt."
Mike Conley is the new GOAT.
Can we get some love for Mike “cool and steady” Conley? Dude is always a positive and cool as a cucumber
Love Mike Conley but it’s hard to consider him a superstar when he’s barely made one ASG
I disagree. Celtics were in the finals in ‘09 and Rondo was a magician that year. You’re also missing Mike Conley coming along and Memphis being a better team. CP3 was just never a clear cut favorite but he will be in revisionist history.
Mike Conley?
He's like Grizzlies Mike Conley underrated and yeah I do think he's better than MPJ but probably equal to Ayton
"Also Ja Morant for me.  Gordon Haywood, Mike Conley, and Shai come to mind as well."
Yeah we need to find a Mike Conley type eventually if KPJ can’t get it together. He’s been a turnover machine
Lmao we would’ve traded Lowry like 5 times if he listened to fans i I remember during the title season there was that 5-10 game stretch where he was terrible and people were calling on him to be traded for mike Conley if I remember correctly lol
Mike Conley game 7 in the bubble comes to mind
"Dwight had 8 great years Dame has had 8 great years.   Who was the second best center in the league when dwert was in his prime.... 3 years of andrew bynum? That would be like if the best PG in the league was mike conley.  Gobert has 3 dpoy, cool accolade but not changing my life. Dame has 6 all NBA's, and I'll bet you he picks up another 2 more in 22 &amp; 23.   Dwight even at his peak had serious flaws that were exposed in the finals against the lakers. The magic beat the lebron not because dwight put up some crazy performance but because the cavs could not defend the magic's big lineups.   Every year that passes Dame will build a lead because he didn't stop becoming a very good NBA player at age 28 like dwight.  I watched all of orlando dwight, it's funny how that stage of his career went from underrated from 2012-19 to overrated after he won a chip with the lakers. He was the best center in the worst era of centers ever. Embiid and Jokic win the matchup everytime against prime dwight."
"Ok I thought I was the only one. I was thinking of making a post. A lotta lottery picks really struggled too even for rookie debuts too.   Some non rookies and their fg numbers in their opening games:   Steph against the lakers: 5/21 FVV: 5/20 OG Anunoby: 3/17 Tatum: 7/30 Lauri: 4/14 JJJ: 3/12 Valanciunas: 3/19 (2/16 from 2, how does a huge 7 footer miss 14 shots from 2? Only 2fts too) Cole Anthony: 3/12 Mike Conley: 4/12 D Book: 3/15 Dame: 8/24 (0/9 from 3, missed the potentially game tying shot) K Midd: 4/14 Kristaps: 4/14 Finney-Smith: 2/12  Some rookie debuts: Jalen Suggs: 3/14, 1 assist, 3 TOs Jalen Green: 4/14 Scottie Barnes: 5/13, 1 assist, 6 TOs  Not so critical of the rooks cause they’re rooks but it did seem like a lotta people put up stinkers. Obviously some great performances like from Bron and Jaylen Brown but seems like more bad ones than is normal."
"We were missing Mike Conley for every game except for Game 6 while he played injured, and Mitchell was playing injured the entire time.  I'm tired of repeating myself.  Please learn basketball.  You've already been proven wrong about every claim you've made so far.  Gobert has plenty of flaws, but putting the ball in the fucking hoop isn't one of them.  Please find a new angle."

"MIAMI — For a long while, the scowl on Kyle Lowry’s face seemed permanently etched. He used that edginess to rise from meager beginnings in Philadelphia as he scraped for stability early in his N.B.A. career.      “I knew I was good,” Lowry said during breakfast at a hotel here. “I knew I was a starter. But I still had to prove it. I still had the chip on my shoulder. I still had to do this, that and the other. And I still play like that.”      That determination blossomed in Toronto, where Lowry, 35, provided a foundational steadiness across nine seasons, six All-Star berths and a championship in 2019. But all that came only after he fought for court time and was traded from Memphis, which drafted him in 2006, and then Houston during his first six years in the league.      The stage is now set for Lowry to begin the final arc of his playing career with the Miami Heat, who hope that the addition of a veteran point guard with a championship pedigree will launch them back into contention for a title. The Heat journeyed all the way to the N.B.A. finals in the pandemic-paused 2019-20 season, but last season were quickly dispatched by the Milwaukee Bucks.      In the off-season, Lowry signed a three-year contract with Miami worth nearly $90 million, joining a retooled team intent on making Milwaukee’s tenure atop the Eastern Conference a brief stay. Lowry was a prized free-agent target after a midcareer span that made him synonymous with the Raptors.      “We all were mutually agreed that it was time,” Lowry said of leaving Toronto. “It’s hard to put it into words. It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.”      His journey in Toronto started with questions — he was the team’s backup plan after a failed attempt at landing Steve Nash — crested with a championship and ended in a season no one could have anticipated.         ImageLowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.   Lowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.Credit...Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press     The coronavirus pandemic forced the Raptors to relocate to Tampa, Fla., for their home games in 2020-21. Toronto righted itself after a shaky beginning, only for the season to unravel when Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and others missed time because of virus protocols.      “The city of Tampa was great,” Lowry said. “It was just difficult because we didn’t know what to expect day by day. We were in fifth place, fourth place. We hit a Covid stretch and then it was over.”      Speculation swirled over whether the franchise would deal Lowry, who was on a one-year contract. The Heat, among other teams, made inquiries about acquiring him before the March trade deadline.      Lowry had pledged to his teammates before the season that he intended to help them compete for another championship. The team’s dismal record made such a foray unlikely, but Lowry wanted to stay true to his word in seeing the season through.      The adage of sports being a business is a truism. Every so often, the reality becomes murkier.      In 2018, the Raptors and Masai Ujiri, the team’s president, traded DeMar DeRozan, a franchise cornerstone who, along with Lowry, had brought respectability and competitiveness to the organization and was beloved in the city.      Toronto acquired Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs in the trade, immediately won a championship and frayed its relationship with DeRozan. It avoided a potential similar fracturing with Lowry.      “Sometimes franchises have to do what’s best for them, but I was in a position where I had say and I had a little bit, I wouldn’t say power — but I had a little bit of, ‘Listen, it’s not going to be a good look if we don’t collaborate on this together,’” Lowry said. “We all agreed that to be on the same page was the best thing to do, and that was that.      “With DeMar not having the autonomy of having a decision, I think it was just such a different circumstance. It prepared them to not do that to me.”      Lowry finished the season in Toronto and landed with the Heat, anyway. “It’s been really tough for us to see an incredible player like that go,” Ujiri said at a news conference in August. “We knew this was coming. The direction of our team was kind of going younger and Kyle still has these incredible goals.”      ""It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.”      Lowry is one of several point guards, including Chris Paul and Mike Conley, who are still flexing impactful games in their mid-30s, a quality Lowry attributes to better modern knowledge about dieting and training.      “I’ve never been super athletic,” Lowry said with a laugh. “I can dunk and all that, but I still play low to the ground. I’m not explosive. And I know how to not jump when I don’t need to be jumping.”      Lowry saw a role for himself with the Heat, a franchise eager for another championship. He had established a relationship with Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra while playing for him at an N.B.A. Africa exhibition in South Africa in 2017. Tampering investigations concerning Lowry’s sign-and-trade deal to the Heat, along with the one that allowed Lonzo Ball to join the Chicago Bulls, are ongoing, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters this week.      In Miami, Jimmy Butler is Lowry’s primary wing mate after he spent years alongside DeRozan — “Smooth,” Lowry said of DeRozan. “That’s my best friend.”      And of Leonard: “A machine,” Lowry said. “He gets it done.”      DeRozan and Leonard are two of the game’s quieter personalities. Butler, though, is a force, both vocally and on the court. Lowry said Butler often communicates through strings of expletives.      “I partly think it’s to get him going, because he’s got to get himself going somehow some way, which is dope,” Lowry said, adding that “some people can’t take it” and think Butler’s a jerk.      “Nah, it’s just how he is,” Lowry said. “Everybody has different demands on themselves.”      Butler recently told reporters that the team was adjusting to how quickly Lowry got the ball upcourt.      “He’s always looking to pitch the ball ahead and get guys in the right spot,” Butler said. “It’s incredible. It’s a blessing, and sometimes it’s a curse because you’ve got to be in some really great shape if you’re out there in what we call the Kyle chaos.”      One day, Lowry expects to retire as a Raptor. Until then, he expects his former teammates to grow into the roles he and DeRozan once occupied. Lowry, for example, faced criticism for missing shots during the first few games of the 2019 finals. He responded with 26 points, 10 assists and 7 rebounds in the Game 6 championship-clinching victory.      “Freddy, OG, Pascal, now they have to take the interviews, and they have to do all the media. Because I’m the guy who was like, ‘Yo, it’s on me,’” he said, adding: “They have to take the criticism, and that’s what’s going to help them grow. I want them to be the All-Stars. I want them to be the champions again. I want them to get opportunities to create generational wealth.”"
"You’ve got win to be great. A really good player like Mike Conley in his prime on the grizz never got the ‘great’ definition because he could never carry a team deep into the playoffs. Lavine is really good, and very fun to watch. But until he proves he can be a leader and win playoff series against teams like Brooklyn or the Bucks he won’t be considered top 20"
"2011-2012: Raja Bell, Devon Harris, Gordylox Hazelwood, Paul Millsap, and Al Jefferson.  2021-2022: Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neal, Rudy Gobert.  I've got my money on current team, but I would love to see Big Al post up against Rudy."
I would take Mike Conley or Dragic over Russ.
Yes. It's not entirely correct but at his absolute best he was a fringe all star on the level of a Mike Conley or a Dragic.
there is like zero indication that the Jazz are looking any better with an older Mike Conley
"1983 Sixers   PG: Mike Conley(Mo Cheeks)  &gt;fringe all star level players, both good defenders and passers   SG: Demar Derozan(Andrew Toney) &gt; fringe all star level players, both very good scorers that don’t take many 3’s  SF: Kevin Durant(Julius Erving) &gt;Elite all around hall of fame players   PF:(Marc Iavaroni)  &gt; don’t have a comparison I literally know nothing about this guy he averaged 5 points a game  C: Joel Embiid(Moses Malone) &gt;MVP caliber centers"
This also ignores that the Jazz we’re playing without Mike Conley and Donavan was injured. I’m not saying the Jazz definitely would have won if they were healthy but both teams were injured so anything could happen.
"Exactly, overpaid players get so much shit they end up being underrated a lot of the time. Mike Conley when he had his massive contract for the time was still a solid player but was getting leagues of hate too"
"Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney, but do Mike Conley, Demar DeRozoan, Julius Randle, and Domantas Sabonis beat Jordan Clarkson, Matisse Thybulle, Joe Ingles, Bobby Portis, and Montrezl Harrell?  Probably not."
Mike Conley
"Nah, sorry that is bullshit.  I agree that the Raptors most likely don't win if the Warriors dont get decimated.  But last year was a real outlier for playoff team injuries, particularly important/star players.  Just off the top of my head:  Clippers: - Kawhi Leonard (best player on team) out injured  Lakers - LeBron and AD out or dealing with injuries   Nuggets - Jamal Murray, Will Barton, PJ Dozier  Nets - Crippled Harden playing on one leg, Kyrie out.  Hawks - Trae Young tweaks ankle in game three against Bucks  Jazz - Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley out or dealing with injuries.  All the serious contenders suffered injuries to one or more of their most important players.  The Bucks did great and earned that ring. But to suggest that injuries played no part is dishonest rubbish."
Stephen Curry Damian Lillard Chris Paul Russell Westbrook Kyrie Irving Ben Simmons Luka Doncic  Deadass those are the only players I could see an argument for being better than Lowry. And I don't even agree on some of them. If you think LaMelo Ball or Mike Conley is better than Lowry boy IDK what's wrong with you.
You don’t consider D Mitch a star? He was dropping like 35 a game and then got injured with Mike Conley
"I wasn't aware any of them have been inducted. I also wasn't aware that Leonard was on their playoff roster.   But while you're on this troll train of thought, how come the Wizards didn't win it all with the greatest player of all time? Why didn't Lebron make the playoffs as the 2nd greatest of all time in 03-04? Why were the Lakers so bad with Kobe at the end of his career? Why didn't the 09-10 Grizzlies make the playoffs with a roster of Allen Iverson, Z-Bo, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, and Rudy Gay? How did the 07-08 Heat only win 15 games with a roster of Wade, Alonzo, Penny Hardaway, Shawn Marion, and Shaq?"

"That skill is so underrated.   LeBron, Harden, CP3, Dame, Luka, Trae, Kyle Lowry, Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley etc.   There's a reason why all these guys, their team's offenses don't go through lulls and are built for the playoffs."
"clippers were uniquely situated to be elite with a small ball lineup, and with mike conley out and donovan mitchell hurt, it put way too much pressure on a weaker utah perimeter defence. rudy is absolutely not at fault, the result would've been far worse without him on the court. it was things like ingles/clarkson/mitchell getting burned repeatedly on the perimeter, forcing everyone to over-rotate and just miss assignments completely, leading to ridiculous things like the terrence mann 40pt phenom  like if you take rudy out, our ortg that series would've gone from like 120 or whatever to 105, and our drtg would've been the same. we would've lost every game by twenty five or something stupid. imo."
was the next best mike conley?
Mike Conley? Unless I'm forgetting about recent extensions I think he's the highest paid Utah player
Hot take: Ant averages 24 points and 4 assists  Hotter take: Mike Conley is not a top 50 player  Scorching: Lebron isn't a top 5 player anymore in terms of actual on-court basketball
"I think you are just prejudiced against Gobert and the Jazz, because anybody who watched that Jazz-Clippers series knows that Gobert's defense was not the issue, it was the atrocious perimeter defense by everybody else on the team.   Honestly what is Gobert supposed to do when Reggie Jackson is blowing by whomever is guarding him in isolation and the rest of the Clippers, who I already mentioned are the greatest 3-point shooting team of *all-time* are spaced out perfectly on the 3-point line? The answer is nothing. Anthony Davis wouldn't be able to do anything in that situation. Nor would Giannis.   The bigger issue for Gobert is punishing teams offensively when they go small, but for that, he needs Mike Conley, who only played ONE game in that Clippers series, something that's conveniently forgotten when it's shit on the Jazz season on /r/nba. Conley/Gobert was statistically one of the best PnR in the league last year. Mitchell doesn't even register that Gobert is an option on offense, that dude has tunnel vision and is only looking for his own shot.   Everything you are saying about the Jazz now are things people said about the Bucks the last 2 years about their playoff failures. Look at how stupid those takes look now."

I truly believe that Adam Silver recognized that Mike Conley has been deserving of an all star bid throughout his career and realized that he was getting older and might never have an opportunity to make the game and saw the perfect opportunity to put him in the game when Devin Booker got hurt
Mike Conley
1. Mike Conley 2. James Harden 3. Lebron 4. Marc Gasol 5. Zach Randolph
"Only 3 things in life are certain:  Death, Taxes, Mike Conley getting injured and the jazz going on a ridiculous midseason win streak"
Swap mike conley and cp3 and jazz go to the finals
*Mike Conley enters the chat*
"Gobert wasn't switching onto anyone, he was helping at the rim. And I think a big part of how bad the defense was the immobility of Mike Conley and Donovan Mitchell due to leg/foot injuries"
Mike Conley is a shulk main
Lebron by a mile. Wiggins was supposed to be the next lebron.   Oden was supposed to be the next great center before injuries. I grew up in Indianapolis and me and my dad went to his HS games and he was ridiculous. Not to mention Mike Conley was his PG.
They were Mike Conley Jrue Holiday level players. They don't matter?
"Michael Jordan, Michael Redd, Michael (Mike Miller), Michael Porter Jr., Michael Finley, Michael Cooper, Michael (Mike) Conley, Mike Bibby.  Maybe we're short on size, but even so I am not taking Michael Olowokandi.  We're just going to play 5-out and shoot the hell out of the ball."
"yeah, off the list completely? Give me DLo over Marcus Smart, Mike Conley, Westbrook and in the mix with Fox and Lowry (and push Murray up to 6 jeez)"
"No Joe ingles, Rudy Gobert, Hassan Whiteside, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Bojan Bogdanovic, or Rudy Gay.  Let's go, Royce, lmao."
"Steph Curry, Giannis, KAT, Embiid, Jrue Holiday, CJ McCollum, Mike Conley, Malcolm Brogdon…tons of really intelligent and thoughtful people excel in this league. The Kyrie Irvings of the world are just always louder.  I really wanted to put the Lopez twins in there too but the list can’t be all Bucks lol"
"It’s a good thing Mike Conley got his all star appearance or Kyle Korver would have forever had a better career than him, according to the all star game gods."
"At absolute best, he is the 9th best PG in the league.   Curry, Luka, Trae, Lillard, Kyrie, CP3, Jamal Murray, and Kyle Lowry have all carried teams on playoff runs and series wins, which Simmons is not capable of doing.    For that reason, I don't think it's possible to rank Simmons above any of them.   Next, these other PGs can be argued as being better than Simmons as of today, but aren't clearly better: SGA, Westbrook, Fox, Morant, Mike Conley, FVV, Rozier, Rose.   Personally, I would only take SGA and Fox over Simmons from that list. So for me, Simmons is the 11th best PG in the league. If your PG is the 11th best PG in the league and you have him for 4 more years on a max.... your team is totally fucked.    Where would you rank him among PGs?"
"He didn't say that though? He said that Net Rating specifically doesn't tell anything about Simmons individual play.  Take Embiid off the floor and its obvious that the Sixers will be worse, he is one of the best players in the game, but for Simmons individually he scores more while being more efficient and having no drop in his assists numbers.  They don't fit, Embiid needs a point guard that can shoot and distribute (a Jrue Holiday or Mike Conley type) while Simmons needs a stretch 5 that will give him space to work in the paint (a Kevin Love or Vucevic)."
"It’s actually crazy that literally nobody called you out for this insane time-warp lol. Greg Oden played with Mike Conley Jr at OSU, not D’lo.   D’lo got drafted in 2014 and Oden was the first overall pick 7 years earlier in 2007."
"He can and has guarded 1 through 5 effectively and he was second in the league behind Mike Conley on opponent FG%. Wiggins is a rock-solid wing, he's going to get rock-solid wing money.  He definitely wasn't ready to be a team's leading superstar when he came into the league, and he might be a bit low-key a personality for it even now as he's approaching his prime, but people thinking he's on a Bennett/Fultz level of busted first picks are just not watching him play.  As for other first picks who aren't the leading option on their teams, I wouldn't take Ben Simmons for Wiggins straight up. Any extent to which Wiggins is a worse defender than Simmons is more than made up for by the degree to which he's not an active liability on O."
PG: Mike Conley SG: Klay SF: Middleton PF: Simmons C: KAT
"It looks like Gobert over-trusted Conley as he stood slightly still on the switch and it looked like he’d aggressively rotate into the roller, but ultimately that’s not the defensive play Mike would’ve/should’ve made and this is ultimately on Gobert. A simple misread by Rudy, but solid exploitation by the Wolves."
He's barely a top 100 player in the playofffs since 2017-2018. He's a total fraud since his MVP season.   I would take Mike Conley over him easily since 2017.   Ben Simmons is awful yet he outplayed Westbrick so thoroughly this past playoffs.   Westbrick managed an awful 33% fg against us in the playoffs. I was more worried about Neto and Ish Smith.
"Kyle Lowry. If he played in the west rather than the east during his peak, we would be talking about him in the same vein as Mike Conley. He’d still be a great fringe all-star level player, but not this HOFer some argue for."
Yea it’s like KD. Dude literally just shoots over people as if they’re not even there. There is really no contest Mike Conley could’ve done to effect the shot besides him magically getting a decade younger and pulling off some miracle block
"Gobert said: """"It's totally on me. [Mike Conley Jr.] was already out there. We switched. I should have recognized that. He did what he was supposed to do, and I didn't. 200% on me. … It's one of those plays, when you watch the replay, you just feel dumb."""
"Using Simmons as the best, no other stars:   * PG: Mike Conley  * SG: Seth Curry  * SF: Marcus Morris * PF: Ben Simmons  * C: Myles Turner"
"Mike ""zero career technicals"" Conley does this.  No one is above it."
"Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, Rudy Gay, O.J. Mayo, and Marc Gasol. Thats basically the legendary grit and grind lineup -Mayo +Tony lol. And the worst player in hindsight there is O.J. who was a second year player coming off of an 18,5 ppg rookie season lol"
"Tony Allen playing defense in 2012 mostly. Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, and Zbo definitely contributed as well with the level of violence they played with for the era, but the Grindfather was truly special."
"I don't think it matters if they are healthy. Sure, Mike Conley has great defensive numbers, but like said that's because he was tethered to Gobert all year and he wasn't a positive defender for his 1:1 ability. The guy replacing him (Ingles) is also a better defender than Conley. If Conley is on the court, he's probably the biggest switch target and Mitchell might be right behind him. While Mitchell has been extraordinary offensively in the playoffs, he has completely abandoned playing defense over his career. It's not an injury thing, he's gotten worse every year defensively and it's because his effort continues to lessen.  Besides, our ""best"" perimeter defender still gets cooked on his own. There's really no need to hunt for switches against the Jazz because O'Neale can't stay in front of anyone either. Murray annihilated him, Reggie Jackson annihilated him. Some of this is because that's what our defensive scheme was in the RS, but the Jazz also just don't have much perimeter defensive talent anywhere.  There's no excuses for what the Jazz did, they simply have to be better. If Quin stays stubborn and doesn't change his schemes and defensive principles, things won't improve."
Ricky Rubio to Mike Conley is a lateral move? lmao
Mike Conley; he had one of the most underrated seasons last year but got injured at the end.
"I played a lot of AAU ball into early high school against OJ Mayo, Patrick Patterson, Mike Conley, and Greg Oden. Conley especially was just unreal. So fast and skilled, nobody could stay in from of him."
Mike Conley. Made me realize very early that there’s level to this game.
Was that his wife at the end? Was that Mike Conley in his moms arms?
I'm only two inches shorter than Mike Conley Senior!  I'm sad that doesn't mean anything since I can barely grab the rim smh
"Well for me I only see you as a bust if you’re drafted high (top 15 for me) and are out of the league within 4-6yrs.  I don’t see him being a generational talent, since I find that term thrown around very often, but I do see him getting all-star selections. If he doesn’t get all-star selections but still putting up solid numbers (think Mike Conley like) then he’s still a solid player."
"Maybe I'm wrong, but I think 12 Tobias Harris-level players would be top-level contenders or title favorites. Using NBA-player rankings from ESPN, that would mean a starting 5 of like Mike Conley, Smart, DeRozen, Harris, Myles Turner. Bench would be some combination of Kyle Lowry, LaMelo Ball, Beddy Hield, Porzingis, Julius Randle, Michael Porter Jr., Jerami Grant, John Collins, and Clint Capela."
"You're out of your fucking mind with the Mike Conley ranking.   There's not a single team in the NBA that wouldn't trade Conley and a first for Trae Young, let alone a straight swap."
I like fox too. But hard to breakout in such a PG heavy conference in the West. It took Mike Conley years and an injury replacement designation to be an All-Star for the first time in his career last year and I would argue he should’ve been on way more.
Utah had the best record in the league last year. Mike Conley best PG confirmed.
mike conley jr
"My pleasure. You did all the hard work, I'm just here for the up-toots.   Total attempts is a pretty big part of the picture, especially with the LA fans gushing about Howards 7 total attempts. Do we tell them that Mills hit 10 in a row to start the season?  OP u/johnhenryirons did a list for 100+ attempts,  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"very impressive. posted in another comment, but the top 10 if you went to 100+ attempts as a minimum on the season, it weeds out a lot of people and the list looks like this instead:  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"KAT has attempted more than 100 as well. The list of players who have attempted 100 or more is WAY too small this early in the season. If you did 100 or more attempts though, these would be top 10:     Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"idk about that man KPJ averages 6 apg and 4 TO/game which is...outrageous. that's nearly as many TOs as Russ.   you can explain away as box score watching if you want, but i would be blown away if KPJ ever makes an all star team in a league where Mike Conley only made one all star team."
"Nah I don't like that narrative. ""11-9 in a weaker Eastern Conference"" but let's look at their L's in that period.   They lost to the Boston Celtics twice who were 2nd in defense that season along with maintaining their big 3 core. Paul ""Shitting don't make sense"" Pierce was still leading his team to a 56-26 record.  They lost to the Hornets who were spearheaded by prime CP3 and had 6 scorers averaging in the double digits while also being in the top 10 defenses.  They lost to the Utah Jazz who had the interior dominant presence of Paul Millsap and Al Jefferson along with a prime D. Will and the jackknife defender AK47.   They then lost to the bully ball Memphis Grizzlies with ZBO and Marc with Rudy Gay being the up and coming 20 point scorer. Not to mention they had Mike Conley and Tony Allen which made them a perimeter nightmare.  After the rodeo in the west they came back east where they got beaten by a Pacers team with a prime Danny Granger, the chonkosaurus defensive presence of Roy Hibbert, and the consistent backcourt of Collison and Dunleavy.   Then they lose to the big daddy Dwight Howard team who would go on to have a record of 52-30. They had 9 players that season averaging double digits and Dwight was still in his dominant prime.  And finally, they lose to Dirk ""The Mullet"" Nowitzki. Their team wasn't just top 8 in both defensive and offensive rating, but they had Jason ""Wife Beater"" Kidd along with Terry, Marion, Butler bringing up the rear.   That '11 Heat team wasn't losing to scrubs and more importantly, they won the match ups that were clearly in their favor. This Lakers team has been losing to random people and a situation where you have Westbrook, AD, and Lebron and LOSE to a Kings team should never occur."
"we fuckin’ told y’all and nobody would listen, they just kept repeating memes from press conferences and calling us salty.  especially those obnoxious heat fans who followed him around defending him. jfc heat fans on the internet suck   fizdale was ass and he committed a truly unspeakable sin - he pissed off mike conley. i’ve never heard mike conley say anything bad about anyone else in the nba ever, but he had enough of fizdale disrespecting marc gasol and was done with that shit immediately."
"The all-in-one stats like PER, RAPTOR, GAY, DARKO, etc. are all super flawed and basically worthless.     For example, last season: Mike Conley had the 5th highest RAPTOR, above LeBron, KD, Giannis, Curry, and Harden."
"Jrue Holiday, so underrated, i assure you so underrated, most underrated player  Before that Mike Conley for sure, underrated"
Mike Conley Jr would like a word.
"too easy, we need one on a super kind and well liked player.  I vote Mike Conley"
"Pau Gasol, Mike Conley, and Joakim Noah. None played for teams I support really, especially Gasol. They just seemed like really great sportsmen while also being seemingly genuinely good people and wanted them to succeed regardless of my support for their respective teams"
I know he spent almost the entire nba offseason with mike Conley the summer before this one helping Conley his old college teammate work on his pick n roll with a rim rolling big.  It’s a big reason conley transformed his player from year 1 to year 2 with Utah
He like punched Mike Conley in the back in the playoffs last year. The funny thing was Conley just looked at him funny and laughed
Mike Conley very rarely guards the opponents best player last yr in Utah. He often didnt even guard the opponents 2nd best player. He's done it more this yr and good guard repeatedly get separation on him w/o alot of effort
They do have a good perimeter defender…. named Mike Conley. Donovan on the other hand saves his energy for one side of the floor.
"Cade looks like a bigger Mike Conley, he is a lock to be an all star level type pg but Mobley has KG potential"
That's cap. Haliburton is gonna be like a Mike Conley level player at best.
Mike Conley and Marc Gasol leaving the Grizzlies. Both have tribute videos and both are getting their numbers retired.
Mike conley
that stat has mike conley over luka doncic lmao
Mike Conley will retire an all star! It makes me happy
"The Lakers literally have no reliable defensive player after AD. He has to cover not only his man, but cover for WB, Melo, Monk, etc. He is still a premier defensive player, and you'd be lying to yourself if you think the lakers defensive issues come because AD.   Gobert has Mike Conley, Royce O'neale. and some other defenders who may not be lockdown but are high defensive IQ players who don't let their guy get open layups the way Melo has more often than not."
CJ is a guy that has more than maxed his potential and skill. Much respect. Fox is perhaps faster than J Wall when he was young and before coming back from injury he could give you 25/3/7 with very good defense as well as a raw raw player. He’s entering his fifth year in the league and he’s still has many areas of his game that he can greatly improve upon to become one of the top tier PG’s of the next gen. I see him being a sort of J Wall/Mike Conley hybrid. He has the tools to be get back to all-star level and contribute to a contender- the main thing I’ve seen with fox is that he has solid character and seems genuinely kind and great with his teammates.
"There's a whole generation of guards that I hate just because at some point some pundit, or analyst, or rando on this site said was better than Dame.   Kyrie Irving, Demar Derozan, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Isaiah Thomas, Kemba Walker, to name a few. Most of these dudes are good guys and very fun to watch, but a part of me loves seeing them have a bad game in the pettiest way, because I know that at some point someone said with a straight face that they were a better player than Damian Lillard. These days Dame usually gets the respect he deserves, but like pre-2019 everybody was trying to act their favorite player was actually better than Dame because of some stupid shit and I still hate those players, just a little bit, because of it."
Who on the Jazz is most likely to punch a fan? They're a pretty chill bunch. Maybe Jingles? Mike Conley?
Mike Conley knows this apparently
"There was no evidence that LeBron was the best wing defender in the league, let alone a deprived DPOY candidate.   https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2012-13&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=MIN*G*25  Mike Conley, Tony Allen, and Marc Gasol topped the defense rating as they should. KG already stands out as the top defender with no one else on his team coming close to his defense rating, finishing 4th in the league. Kawhi and Duncan were also at the top. There were several other players in Miami in 2013 (but also true for other seasons) that were above LeBron in defense rating, including Chalmers and Wade. Bosh was regularly far above LeBron despite anchoring the defenses for the 2nd unit. The best defenders in the league are regularly at the top of their own team in defense rating and usually top 10 league wide as well. This has never been the case with LeBron. He regularly beats the offense rating metrics as he should but his defense lags behind in his supposed best defensive seasons."
"After watching the Jazz bench in slo-mo, this win was extra satisfying. I don’t hate the Jazz though. I think they’re a great regular season team and as long as Mike Conley plays for them, they’re not completely unlikeable."
I bet it was Memphis coaching staff complaining about Mike Conley not being allowed to be subbed in for Whiteside. Jazz had to burn a timeout just get get Conley back in.
Please find me these for Mike Conley
Lol right? Please find me a compilation of Mike Conley or Ricky Rubio pushing people in mid air or smacking them in the face?
Shai is very very good but I think the hype went a little too far last year. His great shooting percentages were really impressive but it wasnt a huge sample size. He is really good but I don’t think he’s an annual guaranteed all star level player like Reddit made him out to be.  I think he’s more of the mike Conley level borderline all star in a league with very deep point guard talent.   It’s probably controversial but if I were OKC I would try to draft well for another year or two and then package shai and picks for a true all nba talent.
I’ll never forget when he straight up head butted Mike Conley in game during their playoff series. Like that’s such a asshole move but of course his fan base eats that shit up.
"He doesn’t have the raw numbers of an all star right now, but his impact is frankly still at or close to that level. The Conley/Gobert pick and roll is absolutely lethal even though it usually ends in some besides Conely taking the shot. Mike is a top 5 “floor general” in the league right now and that’s what we need him to be. Oh and healthy. We’ve got plenty of other guys that can score, Conely doesn’t need to put up 20 a night."
All-star Mike Conley*
Supposedly Mike Conley played a significant role in convincing Gay to come to the Jazz  Which makes sense considering how long they played together on the Grizz
"Conley played like an All-Star when he played, and he's been amazing this season. To paraphrase Quin Snyder, Mike Conley dominated the game last night even though he only took 4 shots."
He would have been better off not playing in that ASG because then he would have been the best player to never play an ASG instead of just.. Mike Conley lol.
Double injury replacement all star Mike Conley
"This is all good during the regular season, but if they want to progress in the playoffs they will need Mike Conley to play like an All Star."
Mike Conley knows how to make his team better. He knows how to make his guys better. Rudy is one of his guys.  I dunno man I'm wistful. A bit of the ole gang getting back together makes me happy.  I'd be the happiest fan outside of Utah to see y'all win this year or next year. I do hope we end up there instead of y'all sooner rather than later lol
"Besides centers (Jokic, Gobert, Adebayo), other good players are:  CP3, Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley, Siakam"
Mike Conley is a name I wanted to mention just cause no one else did
"Well 12 states don't have mandated vaccines. Kyrie value did go down but is still talented to take a risk.   The notable names are Utah and Georgia. I don't see kyrie fitting with Luca in Texas and Miami has Lowry. Arizona has cp3.   A sign and trade for Mike Conley, and jordan Clarkson might work.    Atlanta Bogdan, cam reddish and lots of picks  or hueter, Bogdan and like 2 picks"
"Yeah he's only 25 and missed a year because of an acl. Always avg at least 1.5 steals since starting. Now it's up to 2.1. 6'4 height with a 6'10 wingspan is pretty good to reach    18.8.8. 2.1 steals per game should put him an all star this year since Booker numbers are down. And Mike Conley definitely no. Toss up of sga, Murray, morant for those two spots."
So you think Mike Conley was a top 5 player last season. Interesting opinion for sure.
"I mean he made the choice, if I can't start I don't play. That's some mamba mentality. When he couldn't start any longer he just retired. That's respectable. It's good to have some principles and stick to them. He didn't need the money, he didn't need to prove anything to anyone. In his head it made sense.  We were the guys that benched him. Not sure why he agreed to come here though he would have never started over Mike Conley and young OJ Mayo."

Mike Conley was once in the bust conversation
"Good question. Some that come to mind are: James Harden @ Houston, Blake Griffin @ Clippers, Mike Conley @ Grizz, Derrick Rose @ Bulls, Kevin Love @ Twolves"
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
"My point was with how good he is, his teams should be better. Zach Randolph had more success with fucking Mike Conley and Tony Allen than AD ever had pre-LeBron. I agree his value skyrockets as a second option, but that's true for a lot of people. What makes a superstar is the ability to be Batman.  And he didn't just go to the Lakers, he acted like a complete bitch to get there. Certainly doesn't help his cause."
[Masked Mike Conley](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/26967565)
I'll never forget Masked Mike Conley
"Disagree. For a #1 draft pick you expect *at minimum* a low tier/fringe All Star, someone like a Domantas Sabonis or Julius Randle or Mike Conley.   Wiggins is so much worse than those guys."
Maybe it’s the hair but I see a lot of Mike Conley in his game.
"And jrue holiday, mike conley, and patrick beverly. Didnt face a single healthy PG in 2015"
"DeMar Derozan has got to be one of the most overrated players in the history of basketball, second to Mike Conley."
didn't mike conley used to be good? wtf happened

He made Mike Conley look like Mitch McConnell out there.
Mike Conley still has never had a technical foul
we’re getting mad disrespectful in here. was Mike Conley a role player before he made a allstar team? Is Jamal Murray a role player?
Khyri Thomas was last year's league leader in overall RAPTOR and Mike Conley was 6th
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."
"ha ha I do love me some chicken.  My wife is not a fan of replacing thanksgiving turkey with chicken - she just doesn't get it.    I have to say, whether the narrative of utah is true or not, I love the shift we're seeing with Donovan mitchell and D-Wade coming here and embracing the place.  Mike Conley and Jordan Clarkson sign new contracts with us and we recruited Whiteside and Rudy Gay.  No one wants to shed the idea of us hating on black people more than the average fan who just appreciates good dudes playing good ball."

It's like when some people said it would be better for Mike Conley to not make the all-star game because he'd be remembered more for never making one 😂
They lost without Mike Conley which is a pretty big piece to the puzzle. Jazz have enough talent to figure it out and make the leap and have one of the best coaches in the league.  I get the feeling you don’t even watch Jazz games nephew.

Adding to the chorus - Mike Conley.
Mike Conley
Mike Conley better
Mike Conley. Easy
"Jrue is a good one. He dealt with a lot of injuries there for awhile in NOLA, but when he was healthy he probably deserved to be more in the convo than he was.   I think Mike Conley probably gets one much earlier if he were in the East instead of the West. He's probably in the same group as Kemba, IT, and John Wall in 16-17 when he averaged 20 points a game."
"Mike Conley would have made three or four teams in the East. Lillard got snubbed two times in a row for the All-Star game, wouldn’t have happened in the East  Edit: the majority of elite Western conference guards since 2000"
Mike Conley for sure
"Bledsoe’s contract is an expiring next year with only 3.9 guaranteed. Rockets would be in a position to give them almost 40 million in cap space for 2023 since they could get off Bledsoe and Gordon since Gordon’s last year is non-guaranteed. No way Wood is worth 3 first round picks. Brogdon was traded for a first and 2 seconds, Mike Conley was traded for one first round pick, Tobias Harris was traded for 2 firsts and 2 seconds. Wood needs to make an All-Star game to be worth 3 first round picks"
"The Celtics would be silly to break up the Jays without giving them a run together with a legitimate playmaking PG.  I remember a Mike Conley interview from a while ago talking about how he always had a mental timer for each player on when they needed the ball to stay fully engaged.  I don't think the Cs have ever had that kind of PG with these guys, Kemba would be the closest I guess and even he's a score first, second, and playmake third guy."
So many comments and nobody mentioned Mike Conley yet?
Mike conley
Alright fine what about Mike Conley or Ricky Rubio
His ankle being hurt and Mike Conley being out basically the whole series were the real reason they fell short Niang definitely underperformed but I think the majority of the fanbase doesn’t actually believe it was all his fault. That being said it was still the right decision for the Jazz to move on from him to get better wing defenders most of the fanbase still is a fan of Niang.
"Raptor War has had some ""interesting results"" from there metrics;  For instance last year 2020-21 they had Clint Capela 9th and Steph Curry 10th.  They had Mika Bridges 13th and Mike Conley 16th and Nic Batum at 22nd!"
"IIRC, Mike Conley is right hand dominant in his daily life but a lefty while playing basketball."

Mike conley missed 3 in the bubble. Would have been nuts after Craig blew the layup
"Wouldn't describe it as a horrific metric. It's just incredibly noisy with lower sample sizes. Also, a lot of these metrics are inherently biased towards certain factors and playstyles. you obviously should incorporate several of these metrics when doing an analysis on a player. It's just interesting to see Drummond THIS high up. Reminds me of when Mike Conley the ""best"" player in the league for the first couple weeks of the season."
"bojan is 4th man of the year  but can I please talk about Mike Conley Jr?  people dont really understand how much he means to the jazz, and how good he still is.  I got Conley as Third Man of the year"
"Okay ben is being a cunt but this is fucking ridiculous lmao. Blake griffen, mike conley, john wall, demar derozan, al horford do you know how many max contracts have been given out for the player to not win jack shit and be a ghost when it matters."
In today's game; i'd say Mike Conley &amp; Russell Westbrook (despite the streaky start to the season) but I think Jrue Holliday behind Giannis &amp; Middleton is the right answer.
Mike Conley
I nominate Mike Conley.

Mike Conley is a wizard. Hardly ever wastes possessions
"pretty nervous of not having donovan given how poorly everyone but conley has been shooting  gotta have a big game from bojan/clarkson or both. in addition to mike and rudy of course  but we can win this game fasho, honestly all the players in the regular jazz rotation are good.   conley ingles oneale bojan gobert  ^ thats still a dope starting lineup without our young king"
Mike Conley-less and bum ankle Mitchell jazz
"Warriors are deep and have shooters too, even without Klay being back. Lee is a sniper and Poole is getting underrated due to his slow start to the season. Then you also have OPJ and Bjelica who can shoot 40%+ from 3, and Wiggins can shoot too, although a bit less consistent.  I wouldn't be so confident like you are. You got Mike Conley and Ingles, everyone else is an average shooter."
"Utah Jazz All-Stars tonight:  Donovan Mitchell: 36 pts, 5-12 3s, 8 rbd, 6 ast  Mike Conley: 30 pts, 6-9 3s, 3 rbd, 2 ast  Rudy Gobert: 12 pts, 20 rbd, 4 blk"
rudy fucking gobert  donovan fucking mitchell  mike fucking conley
"He was an all star but had a huge drop off.   * 2018: 23/5/4 and 2.5 spg on 58% TS * 2019: 19/5/5 and 1.7 spg on 52% TS only 38 games played  East all stars were really weak that year. You had Nikola Vucevic, Victor Oladipo and D'angelo Russel all making it (not bad players by any means) and in the West you had Donovan Mitchell, Luka Dončić, Rudy Gobert, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond Green, Mike Conley and Marc Gasol all missing out. If he's in the West he's pretty solidly behind most of the aforementioned players and doesn't come close to a 2nd all star appearance."
"CJ McCollum, a playmaker like Mike Conley, PJ Tucker and probably a defensive stopper or honestly another playmaker. All w/o all stars."
"It isnt. Rudy Gay has had a solid career, he's not in question. Nor is Mike Conley or Jrue.   If you're in contention for being in the top 30 players across a decade, you probably should be in the hall. 3-4ish inductions a year isnt crazy, especially since someone like Lowry would be inducted well after retirement."
"It's possible that's been a recent trend. But look at guys like Steph, Kemba, Mike Conley, Kyle Lowry, Dragic, Schroder. It took those guys like ~5-6 years to become the player they would eventually mature into vs guys like Jokic, Embiid, Drummond, Bam who were already very effective players 2-3 years in. I think you're right the gap has closed over time tho because back in the day you had more examples of this with guys like Nash, Payton, Billups taking much longer than their big man counterparts."
No hes just a fatter mike conley
"&gt; So playing defense gets national attention? Such a random argument.  Clearly why the grit and grind Grizzlies were constantly in the spotlight. TNT games, Tony Allen jerseys flying off the shelves, Mike Conley being named an All Star year after year..."
I see Mike Conley.
mike conley
Mike Conley for Harden
" No Sex. No Land. Don't give a shit, we're the best team in the NBA and we're going to fucking set the league on fire. We're going to shoot so many fucking threes that head coaches get fired, stars get fucking traded, and fans cry salty ass bitch tears of grief as Donovan dunks on their best player, Rudy Swats that fucking shit, and Bogey ascends into heaven with a stepback three. Jordan Clarkson will start his own new religion as a Filipino deity of love and vengeance as he finishes the season as both the MVP and 6MOY. Azubuike wins ROY playing garbage minutes in the 4th because we are up 20 at that point anyway. Teams forfeit in the playoffs rather than go against the Jingler or the fucking Minivan. Mike Conley and Daddy Favs become the first co-Finals MVPS as they wipe the floor with the Charlotte Hornets, while Haygood breaks his finger in game four while down 20, destroying any chances that they come back. Jazz Basketball is officially back."

"CP3 was a top ten player in 2016-17 so yeah of course. The Cavs don’t win the championship with Mike Conley in 2016, cmon now lmaooo"
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"
"I'm acting like they were down 2/1 to a team that had Timo Mozgov and Matty Dellavadova as their second and third best players and to a team with Mike Conley with a broken face and an injured Tony Allen.  Am I supposed to say those were ultra tough opponents ? That a fully healthy Warriors team was supposed to destroy those teams ?  The Warriors didn't play like a 67 wins team during those playoffs, and no 4/2 series after getting down 2/1 isn't stomping someone"
PG=Mike Conley  SG=Spencer Dinwiddie SF=Carmelo Anthony PF=Paul Millsap C=Demarcus Cousins
"I was a very, very, very good high school basketball player. I post this anytime I catch this type of conversation.  I learned what the difference between ""excellent high school"" player and ""first round talent"" when I played against Greg Oden and Mike Conley. That was an incredibly humbling experience for me."
Not top 25 and after that who gives a shit.  Active point guards that are better  - Chris Paul - Kyle Lowry - Russell Westbrook - Damian Lillard - Mike Conley (iffy) - Steph Curry - D-Rose  At least that wouldn’t surprise me If I’m missing some
Like D-Rose notable? closer to Mike Conley notable?
If mike Conley continues playing well into next season he’d probably have the best shot

"You dont get to pick and choose what the spotlight is lol.  He says consistently controversial stuff. Flat earth, throwing teammates under the bus, “first time Ive had a player who can make clutch shots”, “we dont have a coach” or whatever the fuck that was, “fuck thanksgiving”, that weird powder throwing thing.  A player that doesnt like the spotlight is someone like Mike Conley, not fucking Kyrie lol."
"Kawhi Leonard versus Mike Conley April 22, 2017"
"You’re like a parrot bro, you hear that Rudy gobert fact and you just repeat it back to everyone you see. Like the other guy said, mike Conley had the biggest contract in the league at one point. The nba is a bit more complicated than best player=best contract"
"Just wait until the next supermax eligible guy. Mike conley owned that title too. Obviously the most recent will be bigger, happens with nfl quarterbacks too."
"A tale of two halves, probably due partly to the Jazz being on a back to back. Conley and Bogdanovic struggled a lot in the third quarter, Mike with several unexpected turnovers and Bojan still in his shooting slump.   Credit to the Knicks for keeping trying, Randle who struggled in the first half came back in a good stretch as center against Favors and Rivers hit several tough shots to extend the lead.  But Conley, Bogdanovic and Mitchell shooting 3/23 from three makes it nearly impossible for the Jazz to win even when the bench has a good offensive output."

donovan mitchell and mike conley are enjoying shooting me out of a W in fantasy this week feels good man
Mike Conley and Markelle Fultz
i’d like to formally apologize to julius randle for wanting to trade him for mike conley this past offseason
"I said off hand, Mike Conley only has this year left. Gary Harris is like a 5 million dollar player now making 20, John Wall is way better than all of them. wiggins was probably 6th in my mind."
"John wall and mike Conley are worse players and making very close in money. They’re definitely a close second, if not worse"
"But mike conleys making more money than Dlo. Are you saying mike Conley is better than danglo russell? Also, why is Gary Harris here over John wall or wiggins"
Yeah but that's a function of timing as much as the contract size. Midway thru that contract it won't be too-15 and wont stand out so much.*  It's just amazing how much more grief he gets for hitting the supermax incentives. Without the extension he could secure a max from a few teams this summer and nobody would care. The same way they don't seem to mind he:s effectively signed for his max now (think he's actually like 24% of max 25% but it's close).  e:I see 'biggest contract ever' Mike conley is still 11th so might be wrong on that guess. But I've heard the cap is set to jump again on the next round of TV negotiations which would be in by that time.
"&gt;Again without Gobert on the books l, they likely still wouldn't have had significant cap space.   Mike Conley and his 35 million is off the books next season but they won't be able to sign anyone because of that lovely Gobert contract. at least it made them more competitive for a second round exit this year!  &gt;How do you know they aren't? They literally just got a new owner, who knows how much he is willing to spend.  Lmao I have a bridge to sell you"

"If I never hear the words floor and ceiling raiser again I’ll be happy. This must be how non warriors fans feel abt “gravity” LMAO.   Conley doesn’t seem like a floor raiser to me. Usually floor raiser means instituting a harden/luka esq one man system and becoming critical to the offense. Conley on the other hand, I can count plenty of would be champs that were one mike Conley away."
who is more underrated right now? Mike Conley is not the same guy he was a few years ago and Jrue has been called Underrated every year that i think its fair to say he's actually properly rated.
Am I the only one who can't really believe Mike Conley is worth over 200M?
I think he means he’s gonna be the new Mike Conley in that he’s actually all star worthy if you take a look at his numbers but he’ll never make it because of the people ahead of him
"I dont think he's like Mike Conley at all. I think Mike Conley, is a great floor raiser who could run the offense of one of the best defenses in the league. I think he struggles a bit when he has to share too much of the playmaking responsibility and has scalability issues when he has to take a backseat.  I actually think Brogdon is the opposite - he struggles a bit when he's forced to run an entire offense by himself, but is an insanely scalable player. He's greatly helped by the fact that the Pacers this year very much have a Celtics style offense where Oladipo/Brogdon/Sabonis/Warren are all 20+% in Usage rate and share the rock a ton."
he’s like mike conley really good borderline all star but prob never get in bc how deep it is for guards in east
"Curry didn't win FMVP for a reason other than it was just rigged. In Game 1, he got outplayed by a hobbled Kyrie and even got his clutchtime layup pinned against the backboard by Kyrie, sending the game to OT. Kyrie got injured in OT and the Cavs lost.  [https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2015/story/\_/id/13034857/nba-finals-stephen-curry-ot-air-ball-punctuates-5-23-struggle](https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2015/story/_/id/13034857/nba-finals-stephen-curry-ot-air-ball-punctuates-5-23-struggle)  In Game 2, Curry shot 5-23, looked off all night despite having to play his 4th straight playoff series where the opposing team's starting Point Guard was injured (Jrue, Mike Conley, Pat Bev then Kyrie) and he also *airballed* the game winner in OT.   People who watched the 2015 Finals remember that Curry was playing like shit (partly due to Delladova) until the last, like, 2 minutes of Game 3 where he banged a couple of three-pointers at the end... but by that time the game was already over and the Cavs were up 2-1.  Then he was decent shooting wise for the rest of the series, especially in Game 5 where he had about 37. **The problem is that the game turned around in Game 4 due to Iggy starting in the Death Lineup full time (and not Curry's play), which led people to believe the turning point of the series was due to Iggy's impact on LeBron (and it arguably was), while Curry played below his standards for about half the series.**   That's why Curry wasn't the frontrunner for FMVP instead of Iggy, and why the voters conspired to vote for *Iggy* to ensure a GSW player won FMVP instead of LeBron, and they didn't conspire to vote for Curry. If Curry played better &amp; made his impact on the game more felt when the series actually turned around, they woulda conspired to vote for him and not Iggy."
"&gt; Mitchell and Gobert aren't bringing a title to Utah. Their salaries will also make sure they can't bring in another great player to help them be true contenders.   Right, because all the big FAs are just dying to play in Utah...   What FA Utah can get that's going to win them a title? They couldn't even keep Gordon Hayward. Their biggest signings ever are Carlos Boozer, Bojan and Mike Conley. They're not in LA where Lebron and Shaq will just fall into their lap, and Kobe and AD will force their way there.   Even if you draft a superstar player, they can just leave without winning. The list of All-NBA players from the last 5 seasons, who left their original team without winning includes: Lebron, AD, CP3, KD, Russ, Harden, Butler, PG13, Blake, LMA, Love, DeRozan, Kemba, Oladipo, Wall, DeAndre Jordan, IT2, DMC, Lowry, Drummond, and the Gasol brothers.   The only All-NBAers from the last 5 seasons who've won titles with their original teams before leaving are: Steph, Klay, Draymond, Kyrie, Duncan and Kawhi.   I mean, think about it - you can draft the arguable GOAT like the Cavs did, and still end up with as many rings before he leaves as Mitchell/Gobert have won so far in Utah."
"Don’t know why you are downvoted, you are right... furthermore in ‘15 it wasn’t just the cavs who we’re beat up, grizzlies were missing mike Conley back when he was a beast and clippers lost Chris Paul... I can’t remember who else they played that year but I’m certain they didn’t have to play any starting PGs in the playoffs for a whole series"
Mike Conley has been really really freakin' good.
"Not really, if Donovan has a bad night, there's nobody else who can pick up the tab. Any ""contending"" team needs another player like that, and it's not Mike Conley or Joe Ingles. Good depth, but look how well that served Utah in the Denver series."
"Mike Conley, CP3, Ricky Rubio."
"I saw earlier today that someone in the Jazz subreddit said the best point guard in the West is Chris Paul, followed by Mike Conley. lmao, it's gotta be Steph curry hands down."
"I absolutely know I’m biased but there are a lot of reasons to be. Mike Conley is starting off the season playing the way he ended last season (aka really good). Donovan has started this season a little slow but if the playoffs are anything to go off of we have nothing to worry about with him. Bogdanovic (our second top scorer last season) is back after missing the bubble with a wrist surgery. We have a 2 time DPOY with Rudy Gobert, plus Derrick Favors returning fills a massive hole in our roster when Rudy is off the court. Plus we have Jordan Clarkson who has been a walking bucket, and Joe Ingles who pairs really well at the PnR with Favors. Really just have a really solid team and our roster basically only improved since last season."
"The grit n grind Grizzlies with Mike Conley, Gasol, Zach Randolph, Rudy Gay and Tony Allen were legit. Gasol was basically playing like a PG at the top of the key at times. Also had a great 3 pointer for C back in those days."

"We literally had no choice, Mike Conley was meeting with Dallas and was going to sign there if we didn't meet his demands of improving the roster. And him being a bum helped us start a rebuild by getting Ja, JJJ, Clarke, JV, and cap space"
"Joerger dragged a team that played an NBA record 28 different guys troughout the season to the NBA Playoffs, that's with missing Mike Conley and Marc Gasol for double digit games.    He then coaches the Kings to their best and most promising season in the past decade.    Memphis old FO and every Kings FO for the past 20 years were absolute garbage. Remember, Joerger wanted Luka and the Kings drafted a fucking bum."
Mike Conley?
Mike Conley is old af he's not winning MIP
"Absolutely not. He’s not even Top 5 tbh.  First up, using per-36 in an argument for a guy who isn’t averaging anywhere close to it is kinda silly. Jalen Leque is the per-36 lol king in the NBA right now, averaging 29 pts 29 reb and 10 asts on 50% FG. How many of you even know which team he’s from? Means nothing.  Now coming to who is actually likely to win it - here are my top 5: 1. Christian Wood 2. Michael Porter Jr. - Grand Canyon sized gap - 3. Jeremi Grant 4. Keldon Johnson 5. Mikal Bridges/Mike Conley  Honestly, it’s really just between Christian Wood and Michael Porter Jr. right now."
Kinda disrespectful that you guys are totally ignoring Mike Conley...
"No.  Pau Gasol.  Zach Randolph.  And hopefully Ja Morant.  I think Mike Conley was better as a Grizzly than Marc Gasol, but during Marc Gasol’s tenure, the center position in the NBA was a very weak whereas Mike Conley played point guard when other teams in the Western Conference had Hall-Of-Fame quality point guards. Therefore Gasol has more honors than Conley. But Conley was a better score, strong defender, and impacted the game and set the tone. Gasol benefitted from having a potential Hall-of-Famer playing power forward next to him."
"To not waste more gas with you since you are quick to dismiss reality, Utah will remain a perennial 6-8 seed whose realistic objective is to get to second round. This is the squad that you will call ""full of difference makers"".  Jrue Holiday (a reserve all star just like Donovan ""Kobe"" Mitchell) Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis as well as Paul George and Chris Paul were all traded for Role players and that's just in the last two years.  I would've gone for Chris Paul, or Jimmy rather than the corpse of Mike Conley when they had the chance.  If going to the second round to lose 8/9 games is what you call doing more, I'm intrigued to see what you call doing less.  I take it that this year ""since they have Bogi"" they'll win two games in the conference semi finals and pat one another in back ."
"&gt; Except Gobert who is a defensive prodigy no player in the squad is a difference maker.  Shit man. It took you this many comments to let me know you don't actually watch the NBA? You should lead with that so we can dismiss you as a troll.  &gt;The Lakers, Raptors, 76ers, Bucks and OKC all managed to get all stars (borderline MVP players) with role player trades for superstar ""rentals"", which is what I would do if i were the GM of a bad playoff team like the Jazz.  Yeah, who'd you go for? That idea really sounds like their trade for Mike Conley which I've already gone over. If you've got Conley on the team already how to you get rid of him while taking on a player with the exact same contract situation and not give up all your draft capital? I also wouldn't count Jrue Holiday or Josh Richardson as trading for a superstar. As for the Lakers and Raptors where's the AD or Kawhi level player they can trade for right now? How do you build a trade for Harden around Mike Conley?  &gt;I would be much more like OKC which is fielding the same amount of success as the Jazz with a cheaper squad and more picks.  Again, with their trade for PG you're suggesting exactly what I've written two comments saying they're planning on doing. Also since trading for PG the Thunder have made the second round exactly Zero times. A younger version of this Jazz team without Bogi made the second round twice and has two players still entering their prime. The Thunder have consistently done less with more while the Jazz have consistently done more with less."
Mike Conley Jr. And Marc prob go hand in hand. Gasol had more individual accolades but Conley equally contributed to their success during their run. Conley also had the unfortunate comparison of the most loaded pg depth in the history of the western conference.
"I wanted to argue because Ayton or Holiday as the best 3rd option seems crazy but then I looked and it's probably true. I think I'd personally go with Holiday as the best 3rd option or Brown in Boston behind Tatum and Kemba or even Gallinari in Atlanta behind Young/Collins, with Klay injured there are very few teams with an all star caliber 3rd option. If Wall returns to 80% of his 2018 form, then him or Christian Wood could be the best 3rd option out there.   Other candidates are:   * Mike Conley/Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah) * Jusuf Nurkic/RoCo (Portland) * Josh Richardson (Dallas) * Tobias Harris (Philly) * Eric Bledsoe (New Orleans) * Anthony Edwards/Ricky Rubio (Minny) * Jonas Valanciunas (Memphis) * Myles Turner/Warren/Brogdan (Indiana) * Millsap/MPJ (Denver)"
Mike Conley gets his first all star bid
&gt; RESPECT MIKE CONLEY AND JERK IT
[r/nba](reddit.com/r/nba) told me that Mike Conley is bad. If my bible is wrong about this what else could it be wrong about.
Mans had our number last night that's for sure. Lookin' *good* out there. Plus it's Mike Conley he's like the nicest dude so you gotta love seeing him have some success again.
"All of those players have either an extra year of experience under their belt, or is Ayton who Collins is just straight up better than. We should be able to tell after this season whether Collins will end up a perennial all-star type player or a CJ McCollum/Mike Conley type of player"

I think it will be a similar deal to Mike Conley deal in 2019.  Trade LaVine for two (FRPs of contenders) + (former 1st rounder or young prospect).   I hope AKME kept exploring a deal to trade LaVine and took actcion at the trade-deadline.
Mike Conley with the Game 1 Magic type performance haha
Mike Conley
How about Mike “always awful whenever I draft him on my fantasy team and then good when I don’t” Conley
"Derrick Favors, Joe Ingles, and Mike Conley. All certified Clipper killers."
thats fair. hes no mike conley after all
Mike Conley. Why you do this to me. Gg jazz
Mike Conley
I feared Mike Conley when he was on the Grizzlies. I fear Mike Conley when he is on the Jazz.
Mike Conley sons the Clippers every time man lol. He’s keeping the rivalry alive
"When 2 defensive juggernauts meet like this, it comes down to who makes the most of their open looks and tonight it was Mike Conley Jr."
Mike Conley going for all star
"Damn man, Mike Conley can still go off."
Mike Conley is incredible.
Clippers fans are pretty chill  Complete opposite of last night  Mike Conley is the Mike Conley we traded for now. Let's goooo
"Mike Conley with 33 points but also the +24 when on the court, great game by him"
RESPECT MIKE CONLEY YOU JERKS
Mike Conley: Certified Clippers killer
The death of Mike Conley was greatly exaggerated
Mike Conley: certified clippers killer
Mike Conley Jr. is an All-star
This is the Mike Conley we traded for
Mike Conley is good at basketball
Where's Mike Conley?
"After voting 6 Celtics players in, my next 6 slots will all be mike conley"
"Mike ""Diamond Hands"" Conley!"
THE MIKE CONLEY TRAIN IS ROLLING! ALL ABOARD MOTHERFUCKERS! GET TO VOTING!
"Mike ""Gamestop"" Conley  Fuck the system"
"&gt;A.what’s this convo have to do with jazz performance in the playoffs?  &gt; the chain is about the Jazz not making it far without having a top 10 player. I think your playoff performance just a few months ago is relevant.   &gt;B. It was Mike Conley in and out bucket away from advancement to the next round.  &gt; You had all of game 5,6, and 7 to close out. Couldn't.   &gt;C. We added favors, Mike Conley is 3 times better, and JC has leveled up. We are shooting far more 3s than last year, 40% of shots with &lt;40% makes. Anything is possible if that’s sustained  &gt; Mike Conley was playing better than he is right now, during the Nugget series. You said it yourself, IF it is sustained. Royce and Ingles have proven they are playoff underperformers and until they prove otherwise, their regular season numbers dont mean much. Truth is the Jazz have been on the fortunate end of this start to the season with virtually no health concerns and are one of the few teams with continuity and team chemistry. Your schedule has also been a breeze. Come end of the season you'll be a top 5 seed and could just as easily lose in the first round like last year."
"Y’all are not about to have me voting for Mike Conley over Curry, Lillard or Luka..."
If reddit can shake wall street we can get mike conley into the all star game!
"I never even said Joe Ingles was a primary facilitator, I said he can initiate the offense and can make plays for others, which he can. But if you think Donovan Mitchell is your best passer, you are seriously underrating what Mike Conley is actually doing for your team.  Again, nothing you said counter my argument about how Gobert brings something far more irreplaceable than Mitchell. I'm not saying Mitchell isn't a great player, but Utah is simply a talented team with guards and wings, and Rudy Gobert is a completely game changing defensive player and maybe one of these best pick and roll finishers in the league. Meanwhile, you have few other very good PnR ball handlers outside of Mitchell.  BTW: Ingles has averaged 5.2 assists over the last 4 years on less turnovers than Mitchell who has averaged 4.1 assists. For someone who's had the ball in his hands so much, he's not some type of elite passer for your team. Just look in the thread and see what most of your fellow Jazz fans are even saying."
Utah 🤝 Memphis  Make Mike Conley Jr an All Star
I love Donny but if it's a choice between him and Conley making the ASG this season it's Mountain Mike all the way.
Mike Conley is the best statistical player in the league
Mike Conley should be a starter for the West so at bare minimum you should have him in the snub category.
"From a ""gut sense"" perspective, Mike Conley absolutely matches the stats, although I would probably pick Gobert as #1 and Conley as #2. Even though Donovan Mitchell is my favorite player in the league, I can always tell someone doesn't watch the Jazz if they think Donovan has been our best player so far."
Vote Mike Conley for allstar
"Mike Conley was considered washed by many coming into the season, nice turn around for him."
Geoff Snozzerson here to tell you that Mike Conley Jr is an overrated bum ass mofo who will be out of the league in five years!
mike conley has NEVER made it in the all star game???  get this man a spot
Mike Conley is someone I’m rooting for
"Utah Jazz general manager Justin Zanik proudly waited outside the locker room after the final buzzer to give Rudy Gobert and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Wednesday evening. Injured guard Donovan Mitchell yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Bojan Bogdanović gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Mike Conley yelled out, “We got a \[expletive\] squad now.” And before Gobert hit the locker room door, former NBA great Carlos Boozer hugged him and said, “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.”"
All that matters is mike conley gets his due
Until Mike Conley gets that All Star nod this year...
There's an argument to be made. I can't say anything about the defense for either two.  Gordon: 23.6/5.2/3.6 on .510/.427/.857 - 5.2 3PA  Tobi: 20.1/6.7/2.8 on .525/.461/.821 - 4.8 3PA  Higher points on slightly worse efficiency versus lower points on better efficiency. Tobi's also on the #1 seed in the East.   If he gets an All-Star nod though he'll escape the Mike Conley treatment!
"Mike Conley *is* underrated.  Melo and Wiggins are both significantly overrated rn, and they've never *not* been overrated."
"Iunno, Mike Conley maybe."
All my homies love Mike Conley Sr
#MOTHERFUCKING MIKE FUCKIN CONLEY
"The real problem with the ""Is he worth so-and-so many dollars?"" has a great inherent problem. NBA max contracts are cost controlled. So every single team in the NBA can have 2 (maybe 3) max contract players. And upper tier players get these max contracts during free agency. So at any given time there are around 45-50 max contracts out there. And many free agent players will get those available slots. Mike Conley was the highest paid player in the NBA 3 years ago. Why? He wasn't the best player but he was due for a new contract and got the max. As long as the salaray cap goes up the newer max contracts will rise too. So in 2 years you might see Jamal Murray getting a 250m contract or John Collins getting one. They are not the top talent in the league but if you're among the top 50 or considered by one GM to be in top 50 you'll get these contracts.  If there was no cost control then Kawhi, LeBron, Steph etc would get around 60 and Gobert might get 15. But not in this salary structure.  Also Gobert definitely deserves that. He is a top 30 player in my book."
Mike Conley
Mike Conley leading again in +/-.
+/- says Mike Conley is the MVP
"I mean, in the past 3 seasons, they’ve lost to the Warriors, Rockets twice, and Nuggets. The Warriors and Rockets were 2 of the best teams this decade, and they were 1 game away from beating the Nuggets who went to the conference final. The Mike Conley Jazz have only been together for 1 of those years where Conley was slumping and Bogi was injured. I don’t see how they don’t give this team a few more seasons since Mitchel is still pretty young."
"He’s pretty good but a little over rated. He’s a great scorer, but really no better than say Lavine or Sexton. This year it’s been pretty clear that he’s our third best player behind Rudy and Mike. He’s struggled running the point when Conley isn’t on the floor, but he’s only not really a point guard and Snyder’s system is really difficult to run. Hopefully over the next couple years he can transition into running the point a bit better. He can make difficult passes but he doesn’t have the play to play vision of an nba point guard yet. He’s probably somewhere in the 25-30 range of players."
Mike. Conley.
Jerami Grant is way more than just a role player  Mike Conley isn't washed  Luka plays D and has a mid range game  Jaylen Brown and Tatum might be 1A and 1B  John Wall is still pretty good  SEXLAND
Mike Conley is back baby!
The Renaissance of Mike Conley after last year everyone wrote him off as dead in the water.
"Vote Mike Conley y’all! He’s got the highest plus minus in the league, and is one of the main reasons the Jazz are doing as well as they are"
If Mike Conley isn’t an all-star this year it’s a crime
Please let’s Mike Conley get his first All Star nod
Please let’s Mike Conley get his first All Star nod
"Mike Conley, the guy plays like an all-star, guards elite guards with savvy vet talent that controls the game and has been incredible offensively through his career. That said no All-star nods will be used against him."
Mike Conley plays on the Jazz  this is fun who else should we do?
"My favorite thing about Mike Conley is his ability to use both hands. He is actually so good with his right hand, announcers like C-Web and Marv quite literally don't even notice some of his amazing shots with his off hand. I will go so far as to say he has the BEST ambidextrous float game in the entire league."
"Giannis, Westbrook, Mike Conley, Embiid, Boban"
Not sure if Shaq would survive that. Nothing would unite us all more than Mike Conley hate.
"Next, Shaq is gonna start off some beef with Mike Conley. I don't know how cause you can't hate Conley, but Shaq will find a way."

Mike Conley All Star

"Utah's offense isn't the easiest to transition into if you are used to being on ball the way Mike was in Memphis, every PG struggles early (Rubio was AWFUL the first quarter of the season when he was traded here) the season shutdown last year when Conley had started figuring it out and how he fit within it.  Now we are seeing Conley adjusted to the system..."
Mike Conley must’ve realized he’s entering a contract year
Mike Conley +40  Aight
+40 from Mike Conley
"mike conley for all star starts at home, tell all your friends, we're going to the all star game boys"
Mike Conley +40. Unreal!
"Boys, don't look now. But as of tonight Mike Conley is the best player in the NBA according to 538.  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/"
2021 Raptor Champion Mike Conley
Nice to see Mike Conley play like ... Mike Conley
raptor %_%  mike conley all star first timer 2021
"It really is insane how much this sub overrates him. I love a good role player (was one of the few defending guys like kcp on the lakers sub the last couple years) but the love for Rubio truly puzzles me. The dude is a decent passer and defender but other than that he brings nothing to the floor especially in the playoffs.   There’s a couple players this sub vastly overrated. Mike Conley, jrue holiday, Rubio, and Jeremy Lin were all treated as some sort of secret super stars being held back by their teams. Make no mistake Mike Conley and holiday are great players, and Lin/Rubio were good role players but they weren’t some sort of mistreated super stars"
Mike Conley +40  lol
"Utah generates a ton of them, have for years. We just have Mike Conley and Bojan taking them now instead of Ricky Rubio and Jae Crowder (who I love both those guys, but not the best shooters)"
I love Mike Conley
When did Mike Conley become Hawkeye
I'd say Mike Conley
Him and Mike Conley would definitely make the hall of very good. Maybe not first ballot but eventually...
Westbrook ?   Mike Conley ?    Kevin Love ?  John wall ?   Plenty of bad contracts that could be moved .
"Caruso THT and Mike Conley in ""less random"" tier?  Please leave."
Mike Conley is the same way.... except he can shoot
Mike Conley.
Clippers. Fuck Mike Conley
"Patty Mills, and Mike Conley(he is good) but plays like Curry against us. And any young guard that’s playing because someone’s hurt."
"Approximately 75% of NBA defenders have no chance at stopping Clarkson from dribbling to exactly where he wants to go and taking exactly the shot he wants to take. And fortunately for Clarkson, the 25% of defenders who can contain him are usually busy guarding Donovan Mitchell or Mike Conley. It's a perfect situation for Clarkson and he's taking full advantage of it."
And Mike Conley lol
"Mike Conley played poorly last season and he was 32, at the age where players typically start to decline. No one thought he would be playing as well as he is this season."
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles. Here are my two freshly posted player profiles from this week:  Deandre Ayton: [https://basketballbeacon.com/deandre-ayton-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/deandre-ayton-player-profile-stats/)  Mike Conley: [https://basketballbeacon.com/mike-conley-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/mike-conley-player-profile-stats/)  If you like them, feel free to get on my mailing list - [https://basketballbeacon.ck.page](https://basketballbeacon.ck.page/)  Thanks."
"&gt;	Mike Conley on Shaq's interview with Donovan Mitchell: ""I don't know how you can make a statement like that regarding his progress at such a young age.""  He is literally disputing it, and calling it wrong to even do. Too bad Mike Conley has never played sports in his life"
"Yeah that’s why Mike Conley, Georges Niang, etc are all coming out against Shaq right? Just a bunch of nerds who don’t play sports...oh wait"
"Well, that would be a dream for the Cavs! Grizz Mike Conley was a FORCE when he was healthy. If the West hadn't been so deep he'd be an All-Star, no doubt."
"We have won our last 7 games, I couldn't have been happier. Shooting around 20 threes every game. Mitchell is on fire. Gobert is killing it on defense. Clarkson running for 6th man of the year. Jingles doing his thing. Mike Conley finally got his shit back together and Bogey is doing allright."
"I'm specifically talking about trading up to draft Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman, all players who were undervalued draft day but have turned into instant contributers. Esp Clarke who was All-Rookie and Bane who is shooting 45+% from 3 on 4 attempts per game when Grizz needed a shooter   As well as smart trade acquisitions such as getting De'Anthony Melton (6th man and analytics darling last year) and Josh Jackson in a salary dump from Suns and getting Igudola from Warriors then flipping him for Justise Winslow. And their trade for Mike Conley resulted in Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder (also flipped for Winslow) and two 1sts, one of whom tuned into Clarke.  People really don't understand how much work this FO has done to remake the roster into smart young players that all fit together. Yes they got very lucky with Ja and JJJ but to get to this point only 3 years removed from Grit n Grind playoff teams is incredible."
"Awesome, really enjoy watching the team and our style of lockdown defence (3rd in the league) and lights out three point shooting (1st in the league).       Mike Conley is an absolutely brilliant floor general and has totally controlled our offence this year after adjusting to a new system. Gobert remains the league's best defender and Clarkson is probably the most entertaining player I've watched, or at least the player I enjoy watching most.      Nothing out of the ordinary to report from the coaches perspective, Quin remains one of the top planners in the league. As for rookies we haven't really had the chance to see them yet."
Conley new nickname boutta be Mike the Raptor
AD for Mike Conley who says no
plebs with low plus minus hate raptor  get ur plus minus up like mike conley
"thats mike MOTHERFUCKING conley, the 2021 all star"
"[The Jazz right now](https://imgur.com/gallery/7drHiqr).  It's legit great to see it all coming together for Utah (not that they haven't been good in years past, but they've always felt like they only hit 80% of what they could do in the past).  Quin is a really, really good coach.  Spida Micthell is a star and keeps getting better (his vision gets better every day, I swear).  I wouldn't have maxed Gobert but he's great and impacts the game, and he looks much better when he's actually catching the ball all the time.  Imagine not liking Joe Ingles, is that even possible?  Bojan is a bomber and getting Favors back has really helped.  And Mike Conley is back &amp; then some, again imagine not liking him.  You love to see it."
Quinn Snyder is one of the best coaches in the nba. They have an extensive playbook of sets to run and I think the bounce back year of mike Conley and the budding superstardom of Donovan Mitchell is the driving force. It’s nice to see him build off the bubble success as opposed to Jamal Murray not taking the step we all thought he would.
"These answers are overall but weighing recent results decently. So while Mike has been our best player this season, I know overall it’s Gobert still for example.  1. Gobert 2. Mitchell 3. Conley 4. Fuck bro I really want to put Ingles here, I give up this shit is hard"
dont forget our man mike conley
"yep his COD teammates:  mike conley, jordan clarkson and royce oneale"
"This will seem like a hot take, but this year it has been:  1. Conley - Mike has been totally consistent and has run fantastic offense and been gritty on defense. 2. Gobert - Along with Conley, Gobert anchors bench-majority lineups during the end of 1/3rd quarters and at the beginning of 2/4th quarters. These lineups have been fantastic for the Jazz and they have been totally solid during these minutes. 3. JC - Jordan has bent his shot chart to perfection and Coach Q puts him in perfect spots. He is giving awesome effort on defense  4. Mitchell - Don always gets his points and has been improving the last 5ish games and is likely to end the year 1b with Gobert 1a. 5. Ingles - Even missing some games, Joe is casting and making and has benefitted greatly from having his favorite PnR running mate, Favors, back on the team."
"I don't understand the outrage at this call.   Draymond has gotten away with a lot of stuff that other players would get a technical for in the past, the shoe is on the other foot *once* and everyone acts like this is Mike Conley or Kyle Korver getting screwed?."
"And perennial Mr. Nice Guy, Mike “Never Technical Fouled” Conley"

Never mind. If Mike Conley/Jordan Clarkson/Joe Ingles are better playmaker then what is wrong with what Charles/Shaq are saying? Y’all should be hoping Mitchell develops to be a better playmaker than the 3 of those guys together lol.   I would say average playmaker for a point guard of all star caliber.

"Mike Conley, dudes so likable the refs have only given him a single technical, and it was rescinded."
That’s false lol. It’s all relative.   If Steph was averaging 21/5/5 we’d think he sucks now.   If Mike Conley started averaging 30/6/5 we’d be singing the praises.
"His defense is actually above average at this point. He does too much ball-watching, but he's very good on ball and can be disruptive.  His RPM is terrible because he spends most of his minutes playing with terrible defensive players. It's the same reason RPM lists Mike Conley as the 7th-best defensive player in the league this season - his on/off benefits a lot from being played alongside Rudy Gobert so much."
"LA were without Davis in those games.  + There is massive, massive difference between Regular season game intensity and a playoff one.  Those mentioned teams have players with the experience of being champions. There is a reason why stars dominated the League. Mike Conley, Ingles and Royse on their own won't win Championship."
'14 spurs had a young Kawhi that was no where near superstar level and they won against a superstar filled Miami heat with a good coaching staff and lights out shooting. The jazz are top 3 in 3pt frequency and top 3 in 3pt% - and this winning stretch is without Mike Conley. If they continue to play the way they do they're making the WCF.
"Mike Conley is definitely all-star talent imo so the Jazz really have 3, as well as the leading 6MOTY candidate"
That’s a strange way to spell Mike Conley.
1a )Donovan Mitchell  1b) Mike Conley  1c) Bojan Bogdinovic  1d) Joe Ingles  1e) Rudy Gobert
"JJ Redick Apple Podcast called, The Old Man and the Three is great. Recently interviewed Mike Conley.

"Just surpassed Mike Conley for best +/- in the league, Mike has been sitting for 6 games, all of which were wins."
"Eh. I jumped the gun a bit. His on-off is real good though, but he’s only top 15 according to Raptor and Mike Conley is actually in the top 5.lol."
"Mike Conley hasn’t played the last 7 games and missed a most of the playoffs last year, I mean obviously trae isn’t going to put up 27 and 10 but like I said a 23+ ppg scorer. Honestly though I love it, Utah will always get their shit rocked by stars like they have by the rockets 18,19 by the warriors in 17, and by the injured nuggets in the bubble. they’ll have the same team because they locked up gobert and have no room for improvement. Lmao"
27 and 10 over mike Conley. This is why I don’t debate with jazz fans lmao
I went back to the 2007 draft to try and figure out who OP is confusing Tobias Harris with and the only player that even comes close to fitting the bill is Mike Conley.  OP please check the carbon monoxide levels in your house.
Mike Conley
"If thats the case, tell me who the best player to never make an all star appearance was before Mike conley"
"How is Lavine's team absolutely horrendous? We're the 9 seed at 11-15...  And Zach isn't a volume scorer, he's 51% FG and 43% 3pt while clearly being the only scoring threat for most of his minutes. I don't see the argument that his stats get much worse on a better team, maybe his overall numbers, but I'd guess that his percentages improve with less defensive attention, and his turnovers decrease if he's not forced to playmake. And being on a good defensive team makes your defense look much better, look at Booker once CP3 was added.  Mitchell's team is winning, but that's also largely in part due to Mike Conley re-emerging as a star, and of course Gobert's defensive presence. Spida has 3-4 players on his roster that would immediately be the 2nd best players with Beal or Lavine (Gobert, Conley, Bogdanovic)"
Mike Conley isn’t even the poor mans chris Paul
"&gt;	But who advise not to take a ton of pull-ups? Of course it's the coaching staff.  i don’t agree. it’s not like he’s stopped shooting them, he’s just not forcing them. and that is because he no longer has to bail his team out. he can pass to Don Mitchell or Mike Conley instead of Delly and Cedi.    you’re just ignoring that JC is 26 now and has been putting in a ton of work. do you think he’s still the gunner he was when he was a kid in the league? he’s clearly taken multiple leaps from missouri to LA to cleveland and now Utah. maybe it’s JC?   i’m sorry man but it just sounds like you don’t play much ball. Clarkson’s usage is up.    he’s better not bc Quinn Snyder says “ok JC in this situation you can shoot, but don’t shoot from this spot”   he’s better bc he’s worked his ass off and it’s kinda insulting to JC to think somebody else pulled all the strings.    you’re own articles even back me up for why JC is doing well. they mention that his teammates have more of a role to play than Snyder"
"Best player on his team?   I mean...... Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Mike Conley...... I get some sensationalism, but this take is... it’s bad.   He’s instant buckets sure, but to say he’s the best player on his team is absurd."
"Mike Conley, in a blazer and his reading glasses on, looks up from reading his favorite passage from Dante’s Inferno and nods."
One of your “best players” as in Mike Conley? Lol   All of those metrics are great and the Jazz have been playing really well. But you guys seem to act like it’s an indication of something way more than it is
"Honestly Conley facilitates the team so well, i'd say Rudy, Mike, Don and JC, Ingles has been playing amazing starting. Imagine that off the bench, with Conley starting"
"It's 538's new all-in-one stat. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/  It spits out some weird shit, like Fred VanVleet #5, Mike Conley #6, Jakob Poetl #14, , Nicolas Batum #15 etc., but it's interesting to have another stat that prioritizes different things than the other more traditional advanced metrics. From what I can tell, it looks like it favours defensive big men with good on/off numbers, and penalizes bad defense players more heavily than other metrics."
Those are Mike Conley numbers
* Clarkson takes 3s instead of 2s. MF also plays defense now.  * Mitchell is a better passer and has better vision. Improved on Defense.  * Mike Conley understands the system. Better on Defense this season.  * Bojan is healthy.   * Joe Ingles is resurgent.   * Derrick Favors is the backup C instead of Tony Bradley (when Utah would hemorrhage points on the bench).  * Royce O'Neale decided he wanted to be a rebounding god and added elite rebounding to his top shelf 3&amp;D skillset.
"Mike Conley was shit las regular season, now he's playing like we thought he would last year"
"Best player on the best team is always in the MVP convo. It's not homer status at all, it's just the way that it always is. I didn't say Mike Conley was THE MVP. But I think he has a strong argument as Utah's MVP (the team with the best record in the NBA and more wins by 10+ than any team outside of LA has wins period) which should place him in the convo."
Embiid is a future hall of famer and Mike Conley is a nice player theres no comparison lol
&gt;In what world would that put him even close to MVP contention?  The world that cares about the box score and counting stats more than the W I guess? Mike Conley is the reason that Utah is on a 19-1 run over their last 20 games. Last year this team would probably be 11-9 or some shit in the same span.
"Hypotheticals are really weird. I think Mike Conley is probably your second best player, but you guys also likely don't win if he's active, because Clarkson wouldn't get the chance to find his groove like he did tonight  An anomaly from both teams that ended up being really fun to watch"
Voting Julius Randle &amp; Mike Conley         Jazz fans 🤝 Knicks fans
&gt; Mike Conley still isn’t going to make it in the west  Lies
People gonna say it was because they didn’t have Embiid... we didn’t have Mike Conley either though... the nba leader in plus minus
"from this pasta   No Dame. No CJ. Don't give a shit, we're the best team in the NBA and we're going to fucking set the league on fire. We're going to shoot so many fucking threes that head coaches get fired, stars get fucking traded, and fans cry salty ass bitch tears of grief as Donovan dunks on their best player, Rudy Swats that fucking shit, and Bogey ascends into heaven with a stepback three. Jordan Clarkson will start his own new religion as a Filipino deity of love and vengeance as he finishes the season as both the MVP and 6MOY. Azubuike wins ROY playing garbage minutes in the 4th because we are up 20 at that point anyway. Teams forfeit in the playoffs rather than go against the Jingler or the fucking Minivan. Mike Conley and Daddy Favs become the first co-Finals MVPS as they wipe the floor with the Charlotte Hornets, while Haygood breaks his finger in game four while down 20, destroying any chances that they come back. Jazz Basketball is officially back."
"Mike Conley still isn’t going to make it in the west, so that’s all you really need to know."
No (checks notes) Mike Conley
If you squint really hard you can see Pokémon evolution from Mike Conley to Royce O’Neal to Derrick Favors
Royce O’Neale looks like an older Mike Conley lol
True... What about Mike Conley? Or Chris Paul?
Mike”not anywhere close to Joel Embiid”Conley
"I mean, are we trying to compare the game impact of Mike Conley to Embiid right now?  Jazz fans didn't even start liking Mike Conley until a few months ago."
Maybe because there’s a difference between mike Conley and Joel embiid. Conley’s more comparable to us missing shake Milton
Mike Conley over everyone imo
Welcome to the all-star game Mike Conley
Welcome to the all-star game Mike Conley
It's pretty crazy that people think Mike Conley deserves an all star nod over Zion. That's one of those things that people will look back on in a year or two and shake their heads.
"(taken from an old post) Here's my comments on the East forward reserves   East forward depth:  Starters: KD, Giannis  Reserves: Tatum, ???  Positionless nominee: ???  Candidates: Hayward, Middleton, Harris  Hayward: 23.6/5.2/3.6 on .510/.427/.857 - 5.2 3PA  Middleton: 21.9/6.5/5.8 on .519/.441/.925 - 6.0 3PA  Harris: 20.1/6.7/2.8 on .525/.461/.821 - 4.8 3PA  I think Middleton gets in as a reserve so it becomes an argument of Harris vs Hayward.  I can't speak for either's defense. Hayward is averaging more points on weaker efficiency but Tobi is averaging less points on better efficiency on the better team.  There's an argument for either, but if Tobi gets snubbed then we can continue giving him the Mike Conley treatment and that's worth it for the memes alone."
It's a reasonable list but dammit I get sad whenever I realize Mike Conley probably isn't going to make it.
"I can tell you one big difference between the Jazz and those Hawks, Bucks, Raps teams, and its coaching (also notice the common theme of Budd teams overachieving in the regular season and crapping the bed in the playoffs lol). Quin Snyder is a terrific coach and one of the best game planners in the NBA. He's put together terrific gameplans in their recent playoff runs, and the losses have usually been a personnel issue more than anything.   A few other common things I've seen:  &gt; The Jazz don't have a superstar and teams that are legit have at least one superstar.  That could be true, but it might not. We don't really know, but Donovan Mitchell easily could be a top 10 player at some point in his career and it's entirely possible we just don't know it yet. It's true that some teams have won without a current consensus top 10 player, most notably the 2014 Spurs -- incidentally who opposing players and coaches keep comparing this team to, as well as the 2004 pistons -- also comped due to the defensive grit and anchor comparison of Wallace to Gobert. That all said, Mitchell averaged something like 35.5 points (historically one of the best series ever btw) in his last playoff series and lost barely in a 7 game series against a team that went to the WCF.   &gt; This Jazz team has never made it out of the second round, what makes this year different?  Better bench play (Derrick Favors return was an underrated AF move that shored up Utah's biggest weakness -- Utah hemorrhaged points when Rudy sat, and now they don't), Mike Conley playing like his Memphis self, and Healthy Bojan (missed last playoffs against the Nuggets). They were a rimmed three away from going to the second round against the Clippers last year, and that was playing a UDFA rookie as the back up center and no Bojan."
"And Joe Ingles  And Jordan Clarkson  And Mike Conley, depending on who you ask. I think he was playing like an all-star but the way all-star selections work, there's a small chance he gets in :'("
Both teams missing their MVP’s Mike Conley and Shake ‘I’m gonna slap the shit out of you’ Milton
"Who? Like Ben Simmons? Mike Conley? Even Chris Paul? Those guys are all scoring similarly to Lonzo. Conley and paul a bit better (though Lonzo has a better eFG% than Paul), but those guys and long time vets.  Anyway, I don't know how you can watch lonzo and think it makes sense to not have him distributing the ball."
"Quinn Snyder takes a drag from a cigarette: I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, this accretion of sensory experience and feelings, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody's nobody. I think the honorable thing for our species to do is to deny our programming. Stop reproducing. Walk hand in hand into extinction. One last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.  Mike Conley: That's great coach, so what play are we running out of this time out?"
Mike Conley is a great example.
Mike Conley? Lmao
"IMO they have three guys who deserve to be All-Stars, and Bogey and Clarkson could each be in the conversation for the last spot in an all-star game if they have a particularly good year; I wouldn't be shocked to hear that either of them make a single ASG by the end of their careers.  I think there's a distinction to be made between ""borderline all star"" as in, ""players who should be all-stars but aren't because of the limits of the ASG voting system"" (people like Mike Conley come to mind, but Rudy before last year is also true, Mitchell isn't a lock but he's on the same general level as people that would be getting in over him), and ""borderline all star"" as in ""just one notch below being an all-star caliber player"" (these are the guys who will always be on the outside looking in, but might sneak their way into one or two on a season if there's a thin position that they occupy; your Goran Dragics, or your Andrei Kirilenkos).   Jazz, imho, have three clear all-star caliber players in Rudy, Mike, and Mitchell. Bogey and Clarkson could sneak into a game one year where a few of the Western Conference guards or forwards move to the East, or where one guy is sick or injured and they need a replacement. That to me is what a borderline all-star is, and I think those two have pretty solid cases to be in that conversation there."
 Second night of a back to back going 12-46 from three and still winning soundly without Mike Conley
"Jazz have been missing Mike Conley who's been All Star Level this year, and the last 3 games have all been blowouts against good teams that keep the jazz from dropping threes."
"And we've been missing the league leader in +-, Mike Conley"
Just a guess but AD may be better than Mike Conley
Are you trying to argue that  Mike Conley is as impactful as Anthony Davis?
"I think they mean if all the Jazz starters make it on an All Defensive team. Rudy and Royce get first team. Conley, Mitchell, and Bogdonavich make third. I was going to put one of them on second team but that’s underselling our two best defensive players and overselling our other three starters.   Maybe if there’s enough guilt floating around after Mountain Mike get snubbed from the All-Star game he could make the second."
Mike Conley wants to be an all-star
"There's a difference between going through reasons he won't make the cut and discrediting him. Is he a top 30 player? Undoubtedly. But Curry, Dame and Luka are locks, I think Mitchell or Conley has an 80% chance to make it in, meaning there's a very good chance he's jostling with CP3 and other guards for that last spot.  Finding his form is good, but his advanced stats still aren't great, and when push comes to shove, his slump earlier will count against him. Mike Conley has had better seasons with the Grizzlies and hasn't ever gotten an appearance, All-Star Guard in the West is extremely cutthroat and it's not disrespectful to suggest Booker's season thus far doesn't make the cut."
Mike Conley = Charlie Ward + Andre Miller
This season Mike Conley honestly deserves to be in that conversation as well
Possibly yes: Brook Lopez for Joe Harris  Possibly no: Jrue Holiday for Mike Conley
Mike Conley gonna lose his job to Joe Ingles.
"Jazz got Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell, Derrick Favors. If only they had rubio still"
"This. Not to mention missing our second leading scorer for the entire series and Conley for a good portion of it.   Whatever. Let everyone sleep, for we are all Jingled on this blessed day. In the name of the Gobert, the Donovan, and the Mike Conley. Praise be Jordan Clarkson."
"&gt;past the AD  Jrue Holiday missed the series.  &gt;the Grit'n'Grind Grizz  Mike Conley missed the series.  &gt;and Harden and Howard in Houston  Pat Bev missed the series.  The Warriors were a team with an MVP at PG that didn't play a single healthy starting PG in the whole postseason, that's pretty fucking lucky. I had the Warriors winning headed into the playoffs anyway but they weren't only lucky playing the Cavs, everyone else they played was banged up just as severely in the position that mattered most."
"things started clicking, snyder changed his system to create more 3s, conley became memphis mike again (he understands the system and his place in it), we got a serviceable backup big in favors back instead of tony bradley, and clarkson has had his shot selection altered a bit for the better so he’s even more efficient with his omega green light.   in short, all the changes from last year are finally falling into place."
"To begin, they are really really really good. The best jazz team possibly ever. What it all depends on imo is if they can keep the first seed, idk if they have the capability to beat clippers/lakers in back2back series. But if they are able to stay 1st in the west and either play lakers or clippers they are very capable of going to finals/win nba championship. I’m definitely not saying they would be favored but there is a good chance. And to people saying “2nd round exits like every jazz team” this year is very different, Mike conley is playing way better basketball this year than last year. Rudy and Donavon have elevated their game. Jordan Clarkson scoring 17 ppg off the bench easily leading 6 moty. They have 5 players that can score 25+ any given night. They were a buzzer beater rimmed out shot away from making the second round last year and that was without a 20 ppg (2nd leading scorer on team) player in bojan bogdanovich. Picking back up Derek Favors is huge for when Rudy isn’t on the floor as well. This team is so gd deep it’s insane. Again not saying their favorites but they definitely have a chance and if you disagree you are either ignorant/don’t watch or are just simply hating."
Mike Conley has been 💯unwashed.   He’s taking epsom salt lake baths and been finally accepted into the LDS fan base
Plus we didn't have Mike Conley.
He's replacing Mike Conley!  As an outsider though Royce O'Neale would probably be the one you'd not realize starts 'over' Joe
I call it a draw on that front.  We were out Mike Conley tonight.
"No Holiday. No Sam Merrill. Don't give a shit, we're the best team in the NBA and we're going to fucking set the league on fire. We're going to shoot so many fucking threes that head coaches get fired, stars get fucking traded, and fans cry salty ass bitch tears of grief as Donovan dunks on their best player, Rudy Swats that fucking shit, and Bogey ascends into heaven with a stepback three. Jordan Clarkson will start his own new religion as a Filipino deity of love and vengeance as he finishes the season as both the MVP and 6MOY. Azubuike wins ROY playing garbage minutes in the 4th because we are up 20 at that point anyway. Teams forfeit in the playoffs rather than go against the Jingler or the fucking Minivan. Mike Conley and Daddy Favs become the first co-Finals MVPS as they wipe the floor with the Charlotte Hornets, while Haygood breaks his finger in game four while down 20, destroying any chances that they come back. Jazz Basketball is officially back"

Mike Conley wasn't even playing too. We go deeeep.
Mike Conley returned and they have Bogdanovic from an injury. Also they only had Clarkson for half a season so they have a ton more chemistry now. And they resigned favors after one year in NOLA so they have a playable backup center Ed Davis was shit
"We brought back Favors and we are starting Royce O'Neil instead of Joe Ingles and he's playing INCREDIBLE defense... He's actually holding all this shit together.  Joe is now a flamethrower off of the bench with Clarkson.  Conley is playing like Memphis Mike again finally, which is a game changer.   Also, we went to an outside in mentality with all of our shooting capability, which has revolutionized how we get buckets.  Of course Joe is starting when Conley is out."
"Snyder redesigned their offense to get them even more three pointers after leading the league in threes last season.  Mike Conley woke up and figured out how to play with the team (thought he's out tonight), Bojan is healthy and shooting well again for the first time since mid-season last year, they picked Favors back up to be the foundation of the defense when Gobert isn't on the court, and the pieces have meshed together further from where they were at in the playoffs.  You can tell the players are more confident that they know where their teammates will be so they can make plays quicker than last season too."
"things started clicking, snyder changed his system to create more 3s, conley became memphis mike again and we got a serviceable backup big in favors back."
Don't know why you're counting out your team. The Bucks have been unbelievable lately and have the reigning back to back MVP.       Holidays absence from the game is offset by Mike Conley being out for the Jazz too so I'm expecting a back and forth contest.
Mike Conley comes from a super wealthy family? That's a fun fact
The disrespect to Mike Conley
No respect for the Jazz. Mike Conley and Rudy Gobert are well most of those guys.
I feel like it might also be due to the context of the personnel he's had around him on the court for so much of his career--mostly because Mike Conley now comes to mind so often when thinking about point guards' lob aptitude. Chris Vernon has brought it up a couple times but playing alongside a Marc Gasol rather than a Rudy Gobert dictated a lot of which skills were developed. I can only imagine Dame could be a similar case.    &amp;nbsp;  But also it might just be that three pointers go brrrrrr.
I'm going to assume Mike Conley cause his family is super wealthy so they probably know a lot about investments and taught good financial skills.  Old money also keeps a low profile
"Bojan Bogdanovic, Joe Ingles, Royce O'Neale, and Georges Niang are all like that for Utah as well.  Mike Conley is pretty close to making it too, lol.  Still totally crazy for someone like Steph, though.  His offensive load is huge for Golden State."
"Just for clarification, I wasn’t ranking the best point guards. Just ranking the PGs I named. I believe Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday, and most Starting PGs are better than Patrick Beverley + Kemba Walker"
"Did you write this entire post just to stan Chris Paul?  I can promise you he’s not reading this Reddit thread.  Jazz in 4.  One thing I disagree with u/cosmicdave86 on though, I also think Mike Conley is having a way better season than Chris Paul."
**PG:** Mike Conley   **SG:** CJ McCollum   **SF:** Richard Jefferson   **PF:** Lamar Odom   **C:** Marcus Camby
"They went to seven against one of the hottest teams with a bad version of Mike Conley and no Bojan. I think they definitely got out of the first round. But at the same time, I don’t really see them winning the championship, but it is possible. For those reasons I’m gonna say 1st round."
"We can create a really simple argument for Mike being better than DeMar and Shai. We can say DeMar and Shai are better offensive players, but not by that much. Whereas Mike is a far far superior defensive player, so much so that he becomes the better player.  Or we can have a more implicit understanding that Mike conducts one of the league's best offenses. So despite what DeMar and Shai contributes individually, they'd never be able to replicate or contribute to the league's best offense, much less be IN FUCKING CHARGE OF IT.  Something a lot of people on this subreddit don't understand is how fucking difficult it is to control the pace of the game. LeBron does it, Lukea does it, Chris Paul is a fucking master at it. Mike Conley is literally one of the best at controlling the pace of the game, and it is vital and so difficult to quantify it's importance other than number of possessions, because it's number of possessions you wanted versus number of possessions you played into. It's honestly not something I can explain adeptly and it's rarely even acknowledged on this sub, that controlling the game is literally what Mike does and many of us can't understand it."
Doesn't he have a son named Mike Conley III? That'd make Jr a II.
His name is Mike Conley Jr.
Mike Conley-esque
"Didn't Conley just say on Reddick's podcast that he probably gets away with fewer calls because of his nice guy reputation?  Like that he's probably earned a tech or two but it hasn't been called.  EDIT: Yep.  https://www.radio.com/wgr550/sports/nba/jazz-vet-mike-conley-has-never-been-called-for-a-technical  &gt; “I actually had this conversation with [Pelicans guard] JJ Redick the other day. I was like, ‘Man, if it was you, JJ, that said what I said, you’d probably get a tech,’” said Conley, who despite career averages of 16.8 points and 6.6 assists per game, has never been named to an All-Star team. “But for me they’re like, ‘Alright, Mike, calm down a little bit. I’ll take a look at it.’”"
"Mike Conley and rimming out game winning shots, name a more iconic duo"
"I mean, no one is saying that, but there were points in this game that even Mike Conley was complaining, which just doesn't happen."
Lol mike Conley missing game winners is a given at this point
I was more so saying that he other teams would be shortening their bench and you’re not going to be getting very many opportunities to play Rudy and Conley against a lineup of Milton - Korkmaz - Thybulle - Mike Scott - Dwight.
Snyder has two bench players way better than anyone on the Sixers bench and yet he still staggers his starters minutes to have Conley/Gobert with them  Doc meanwhile is putting all-bench lineups out there that includes barely 1 ball handler and the corpse of Mike Scott
"Mike Conley makes such a difference on this team, man"
Nobody outside of Utah gives a single fuck about the Jazz. The Jazz could go 74-8 and they'd still be irrelevant. Non-hardcore fans don't want to watch Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley (as good as those guys are).
"Just went back to check. The starting five of the 2008 Rookie Team was composed of Al Horford (21), Kevin Durant (19), Jeff Green (21), Mike Conley (20), and Luis Scola (27 years young) lol"
Idk Mike conley says he can get away with saying some stuff on the court bc refs know he has a rep of not having any techs. Kinda the opposite in that case
What about Mike Conley? I never saw Conley as a high usage point guard like Westbrook or CP3. He could’ve slotted in well next to Lebron as an auxiliary playmaker
I think Mikal is starting to get the recognition he deserves. It might actually be Dario at this point. A net rating of 21.6 is actually absurd. The only other player getting real minutes who comes close to that is Mike Conley at 16.0.
"It's dumb to even make it a thing because it's literally part of his name! Its not like they're calling Lamelo the black mamba or something. It's like asking Michael Jordan how they feel about Mike Conley being called ""Mike""."
"I definitely can relate to what Mike Conley is saying here.  &gt; **Mike Conley, Utah Jazz:** I haven't eaten red meat in probably almost two years. Some people believe in eating it, some people don't. Cutting it out did a lot for me, just as far as my digestive system and stuff like that. I found everything was just working correctly for me. Then coupled with that, the sugar portion of it. Not all sugar's bad, but I ate a lot of artificial stuff growing up—candies and things like that that aren't good for you and what that does to your body. As you get older, and I'm getting up there as far as athletes are concerned, you start to get aches and pains. It's like: Why is my knee sore today? Or why is my ankle sore? Why does my back hurt? The more I started to eat healthy and eat right, less sugar, drinking more water, staying hydrated, stuff like that—all those aches and pains started to go away. I'm gonna try to stay away as long as I can and splurge every now and then.  Been eating a lot more fish the last couple of years. However, I probably splurge more than he does, I imagine... 🤣"
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
TIL Mike Conley was a bust
"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, DeMar DeRozan and Mike Conley deserved to make the All-Star Game over Devin Booker."
"Wed shit all over the jazz. Eric Gordon made mitchell his bitch and locked him up, gobert couldn’t do shit on switches and capella was fine on your guards, and you guys tried to sell out so hard on harden by guarding him from behind because you were scared of gobert having to defend outside 3 feet. Harden and Paul would run circles around the jazz, mike conley isn’t turning a back to back 4-1 loss into a series win"
"Same, Mike Conley is definitely more my type."
"Mike Conley has never deserved an All Star spot. I’m tired of hearing “he’s the best player to never make the all star”. Somebody show me when he was ever better then Harden, CP3, Russ, Lillard or Curry. Because those are the guys he’d have to outperform"
"From when this was posted last week:  Having the most makes doesn't necessarily make you the best.

Jokic and Horford are both 10 for 18, AD is 12 for 26, and Reggie Jackson is a scorching 2 for 28."
"Marc Gasol played with Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Kyle Lowry, Kawhi Leonard.  Jokic plays with MPJ and Murray.   Obviously Jokic isn’t nearly as good a defender as Gasol but it’s also hard when every dude and his mum can blow by your guards and you’re trying to stay out of foul trouble because you are your entire teams offensive system."
"It would be like last year if Mike Conley was wide open, down 1, and he still shot the 3"
The Mike Conley All Star snub revenge season is powering both the Grizz and the Jazz.
"Side note: I hope the Jazz win the championship in some ridiculous dramatic fashion, so they make a movie out of it and Daveed Diggs gets to play Mike Conley. Maybe there's a political twist."
"Mitchell was probably a little better last year than this year, and Bogey was better last year and this year. Gobert was also better last year than this year. All 3 have still been good this year.  Joe Ingles was average last year, but has been amazing this year. Jordan Clarkson was even better this year than last year (he should also be MIP). Mike Conley turned it on late last year, and he has been much better this year. Favors is a much better player than Bradley. Niang is more playable this year.  The Jazz have been playing this style of passing the ball around for quite some time, with occasional iso play. We just needed to hit our shots.  What people forget in that 2018-19 Houston series, we couldn't hit shit, and I felt we got better shots than Houston in Game 3 and 5."
Mike Conley changed.
"Imagine thinking mike conley and donovon mitchell are going to keep up with kyrie, harden and kd lmao “firepower to match”  Gobert isn’t a good perimeter defender, I don’t know why you’re taking issue to it. Do you watch your own team play?"
"Holy fuck these nerds think Mike fucking Conley is as impactful as Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid because a stat told them to.  Joel Embiid is an MVP candidate carrying his team to first in the East and somehow Mike Conley is on par with him? What reaction do you think you would garner from say, the NBA on TNT crew if you said that Mike Conley is ""as impactful"" as that list becuase RAPTOR said so."
"I was at that game, I talked shit on rudy because Mike conley out rebounded him and a crazy lady got mad at me in the train for talking bad about rudy"
"\- They have arguably the best pure defensive player in the league. Rudy just completely shuts down the paint. He's the DPOY  \- Mitchell improved his playmaking this year. He's now a threat to set up teammates as well as scoring  \- Mike Conley is back to his old self - great playmaking, shooting, defense and leadership - and not hobbled by last year's injury  \- Jordan Clarkson is the 6MOTY, he's an absolute flamethrower and 2nd units just have no answer for him  \- Knockdown shooters like Bojan and Ingles who play meaningful minutes  \- Great depth pieces like Royce O'Neal and Derrick Favors  They're just a complete team top to bottom with few, if any, weaknesses. The biggest one is the lack of a clear-cut superstar, which has hurt great regular season teams before in the playoffs. It remains to be seen how it will affect them, and if Mitchell can take that next step and become that superstar level player."
Lakers feast on you with AD and our german back.  Literally churning out Gobert into a filet mignon. And having a side of Donovan Mitchell as a balsamic vinaigrette salad. Finishing it off with a aged Mike Conley glass of red wine in our bellies.  Feel lucky you false musicians.
"Mike Conley is playing like Conley, Bojan is back, Clarkson is unreal. We got Favors back for our backup center. Ingles is playing well. Gobert is clicking with everyone more. Mitchell trying to be more of a playmaker. Royce doing all the dirty work."
"fucking idiot, always spouting box score stats. You know why Ben Simmons deserved the all star spot over Trae this year? Because he helps to win more. Same with Mike Conley over Jrue. Jrue was only saved because the owners don't want 80% of the all stars to come from the west lol. idiot."
"Feel so bad for Mike Conley. Not to say that he isn’t better than Booker, but man it’s such a shame that he didn’t get the nod."
"Mike Bibby: 73.2 career Win Shares, 33,962 minutes played  Mike Conley: 77.1 career Win Shares, 27,792 minutes played"
"Mike Conley isn't washed, Spida took another step, Gobert has friends, Boggy and Jingles are good at basketball.     Team cohesion goes a long way in a season with half an off season and no practice. Their *big FA signing* was Derrick Favors who's played there like 9 years"
"Mike Conley was 2 rebounds and 2 assists from a triple double.   Should've given that man All Star, but I get it. West is stacked at guard."

I mean Jeff Teague has been an all star more times than Mike Conley so it has to be a good deal
"This recent stretch against Philly, LAC and LAL have had injured players but we beat the Pacers, Celtics, Bucks (x2) and Miami all without Mike Conley.         We also produced wins earlier this season against a healthy Clippers as well as the Spurs, Warriors, Blazers and Mavs (x2), Hornets (x2) all by at least 15+ points and many by 20+ so we've still been racking up quality wins"
"Uhh, no? If there's 1 and 2 taken by Bron and AD, 3 and 4 presumably by Don and Rudy, 5/6/7/8 I think Dennis is 7, 8 at least. I'll give you Joe and Clarkson in 5/6, and Mike Conley can be argued for one of the 5/6/7 spots. TBH Trezz should be in the top 10 convo here not completely sure where tho"
What the fuck does Mike Conley need to do
why did espn put “0 all star appearances” under mike conley smh
Mike Conley should have been there instead
Someone tell them Mike Conley has more Warzone wins than their whole sub combined  No personality my ass
Doesn't deserve it 100%. Neither does AD tbf. Should've been Mike Conley.
Mike Conley  Terry Rozier
I'm just here because I am contractually obligated to comment how great Mike Conley is.   The contract is between me and my heart.
Mike Conley is underrated. It’s a shame that he never made the All-Star team when he was on the Grizzlies.
"Mike ""somehow not an All Star"" Conley bout to take his frustration out on us"
No. Mike Conley tho...
Mike Conley Snubbed again
"There are 101 retired players with one all star appearance. I had to count the list myself and i cant remember any of them at the moment. But i will always know mike conley is the best to not make it.   That being said, im sure getting the recognition from your peers and coaches and selected outweighs being known as the best to never do something"
Nobody cares about Mike fucking Conley.
"Harden wins in 2015 on the Warriors. Easy. Curry underperfomed so bad in the Finals vs. LeBron in a down year for him &amp; an undrafted Aussie as his 2nd best player that Harden might even do better than him and actually win FMVP.   Harden's scoring abilities with that GSW spacing is dropping 30 on Delly as he's too little to guard a physical scoring guard like Harden vs a more finesse shot creator in Curry, who he defended well early in the series.  Curry also faced 4 straight teams without their opposing point guards. 3 of the 4 teams' guards were their best defenders: Jrue, Mike Conley, Pat Bev and Kyrie.   Harden wins 2015 easy. He wouldn't have to face the Warriors or any opposing defensive guards and just coast on the way to a ring."
Would you consider Conley better than Mike Bibby? He’s always had that distinction to me
"Mike Conley for Randle, Vucevic, or Lavine."
Mike Conley is the best player to never get an All-Star nod.   I'm not saying he deserved it over Booker or vice versa.  He'll be an All-star in my heart
Kinda wish Mike Conley made it somehow but oh well. I guess he’ll just have to wreak havoc on the league next year &gt;:)
"Naw, onto Mike Conley next"
"My point is if Mike Conley was the 1B to Devin Booker on the Suns, Booker would get the spot not him.  If Chris Paul was the 1B to Mitchell on the Jazz, Paul would get the spot"
Can’t forget about “HORSE challenge champion Mike Conley”
"Jimmy Butler got traded, Paul George got traded twice, Mike Conley got dealt. There's been plenty of big names that they had the salary and assets to get and would fill a need but they didn't. Obviously we have incomplete info, but I don't think saying ""who should they get"" is really ever fair today.   Also, look how easily the Sixers improved this year by minor roster changes (plus obviously Embiid going nuts but I think their improved spacing has really helped).  The Nuggets rolled back a worse roster than last year when they were a few games away from the finals last year. I feel like its fair to question that."
jrue holiday and mike conley only because they won teammate of the year lol
"Thanks, now I can update my list of All-Star snubs!  DeMar DeRozan  Jordan Clarkson  Mike Conley  Christian Wood  De'Aaron Fox  Clint Capela  Domatas Sabonis  Trae Young  Fred Van Vleet   Devin Booker  Tobias Harris  Khris Middleton  Jamal Murray  Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo  Jimmy Butler  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Gordon Hayward  *Russell Westbrook*"
"Bad take: I’m not saying what’s right or wrong here but the jazz system really makes players stats thin out throughout the roster. It’s why gobert is averaging 14 a game or Mitchell 3 rebounds, mike Conley is playing with 4 different ball handlers AND 5 realistic scoring options, of course his stats are going to be watered down"
Mike Conley running out would be more of a surprise lol everyone expects Booker to be the replacement
"im glad humans decide that and not code  edit: im also really confused why mike conley should be making it over booker, ingram, among others in the west according to some"
Mike Freaking Conley as well. Most important player on the best team in the league
"I’m a Jazz fan, and I’d argue that he has been better than Donovan Mitchell this year at making the team better. Higher efficiency, and better advanced metrics than Mitchell. At the same time, I understand why the eye test is important to the nba, and they’d rather have young, flashy, explosive offensive players as the face of the league. But in terms of value to his team, mike Conley is way up near the top of the league this year (and years past). He’d have probably gotten in by now if he talked a little more trash, and drew more attention to himself."
"Dude can have more than 1 goal.  &gt; Mike Conley is tired of being the answer to a trivia question: “Which active NBA player has had the best career without being named an All-Star?”I’d rather ditch that label, you know?” Conley said.  &gt; That’s because the All-Star reserves will be announced on Tuesday night, which is when Conley will learn if the Western Conference coaches decide to reward his stellar play this season with an All-Star nomination. “That would mean the world to me, obviously,” Conley said.  &gt; “It would say a lot about me as a person after the year I had last year, to come back and compete at the level I competed at. I do feel like I’ve played well enough to be in that conversation and to quite frankly be one of those reserves,” he asserted. “I think that this year, everything is falling into place: We have the best record and we’ve got our coach coaching the West team. “So it’s all falling in line,” Conley finished. “If it’s not going to happen this year, man, that’ll be tough.”   The man literally made statements saying it would mean the world to him to be an all star, that he feels he is deserving of an all star nod, and that he doesn’t like being “the best player to never be an all star”. Yet people still like to pretend he doesn’t care about that."
"So when AD gets dropped cause of injury, what do you think the odds are that Mike Conley gets the nod as an injury replacement?"
nah mike conley is overrated af. throw that plus minus shit in the trash
"That's kind of what I was thinking - Mike Conley will get a lot more optics for never making the All-Star team versus if he had made just one.  Did you know Clifford Robinson and Jeff Hornacek were 1-time All-Stars in the early 90's? Probably not, but you'll always remember that Mike Conley was never one."
Because it would be silly for Mike Conley to play 1:21 in an all-star game
Like that time Dirk made the injury replacement over Mike Conley.  Some dudes just have a standing invite
We're happy enough with Finals MVP championship Mike Conley this year
did you watch mike conley play last year
"Relies more on quickness than any of those guys, and he's not an elite passer, so an injury limiting his athleticism is gonna hurt him a lot. That being said, he's *still* only played 15 games coming off this knee injury with basically no training camp. Give it some damn time, Mike Conley was playing like ass for 40 games last year and this year he's been great again"
What about World Star Mike Conley?
"Absolutely no way, what sounds better for him post retirement, all star Mike Conley, or no all star Mike Conley?"
"If anyone got snubbed, it's Mike Conley."
In a way it’s probably even better for Conley this way  He gets to always and forever be the answer to that question instead of “1x all star Mike Conley”
Mike Conley didn’t deserve to be an all-star. He’s a good player who impacts winning but stats matter for the all-star game.
Mike Conley and Memphis fans have joined the conversation of 'small market teams constantly being fucked'
They should of put Mike Conley in.
"Well. You're right. Mike Conley has always been an underrated point guard. He is one of the main reasons for the Utah Jazz's impeccable season, though no one gives due credit to him. Such an unselfish player.  The reason why CP3 got a place in the All Star game , is that his presence made the Suns a playoff threat, from being a borderline playoff probability. That being said, I think Zion could be replaced with a legit player like Mike Conley, with all due respect to Zion as a player. He is awesome. No doubt about it. But you could put Booker in place of Zion, just because of his impact on the team, doubled up with the ever lasting basketball IQ and unselfishness of CP3. Rarely do we see players like CP3 and Conley. Even Sabonis is having an excellent season."
"Lol not every contract has incentives like that, and Mike Conley and his 30+ million guaranteed a year certainly doesn’t have all star incentives"
When is the injured replacement announced ? Please Mike Conley
"1) AS selections are DEFINITELY record based. Several players have been snubbed in the past based on team record, most notably Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Devin Booker and Mike Conley. Middle of the pack records are often not rewarded with multiple selections even if they have good candidates.  2) Every team has had to deal with missing players, injuries, covid issues, rescheduling etc. That is now an excuse. Pacers didn't have Oladipo for a while, traded him, then lost Levert who they traded for. They still don't have Warren and lose Lamb too often. For that matter is mostly been Sabonis anchoring the team to a revised higher than the Celtics. 3) Sabonis is absolutely a player with All Star worthy stats. 21.5/11.6/5.7 is very much comparable to what Brown and Tatum are averaging. I like Brown and Tatum and I think they're having great years, but you're just stanning lol."
Aka Mike Conley
"1st round, game 7. Mike Conley shoots to win in the last seconds, and misses. Mavs advance."
"As a fan i'd like to see some of these guys play. The All NBA / All Defense Teams are about awarding people. All Star Game is more about being fun.   Some guys left off, that definitely could be fun if they were involved. And Conley constantly getting left off through his career.  * Trae Young * DeMar Derozan * Domantas Sabonis * Tobias Harris * Devin Booker * Mike Conley * De’Aaron Fox"
Mike Conley is likely the best player in the league that has never been an all-star AND he has had the best plus minus in the league. Dude deserves to take AD's spot. This is possibly his last chance too. Who knows?
A bit of hyperbole but Conley was leading the league in +/- until he got injured (now second behind Gobert). Conley was consistently the second best player for the number 1 seed (and has had a stellar career) so it is understandable there is passion for Mike Conley
"If you look at the last 20 years of 4th picks, you'd probably take 17/5/3 and 40% on threes - basically Miller's first 10 years - over half of them?  Patrick Williams Deandre Hunter Jaren Jackson Jr Josh Jackson Dragan Bender Kristaps Porzingis Aaron Gordon Cody Zeller Dion Waiters Tristan Thompson Wesley Johnson Tyrese Evans Mike Conley Russell Westbrook Tyrus Thomas Chris Paul Shaun Livingston Chris Bosh Drew Gooden Eddy Curry"
"some gms probably do, but you know who really does? writers.  the more silly blogs that post ""top 10 free agents"" ripped almost directly from reddit, the more the shit gets aggregated, then espn picks it up, then its an actual story  so you keep your head down here about mike conley being a FA and maybe it will have a butterfly effect"
I remember when we were debating if we should go for Mike Conley or Jeff Teague in the offseason.
"I don't think I really agree. While it's certainly possible have both, the vast majority of dudes at the top do so with athletic prowess. Not to say it means dudes are dumb, but I think the vast majority of the top players in the league are of average mental capacity at best. In my experience, the greatest sports minds are often role players. Some notable exceptions off the top of my head are CJ McCollum, Kobe, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Bosh, Kevin Love, Mike Conley, and I'm sure there's more but again, I'd argue they're the exception, not the rule."
&gt; Mike Conley is better than all of them...  No he's not... Jimmy has a higher RAPTOR
The RAPTOR is considered a widely accepted advanced stat now? Mike Conley is better than all of them...
"Glad Goran made one at least, he deserves one. Ben will get plenty more in his career, just glad Goran has one. Mike Conley kinda situation"
"It's not a perfect comparison because he's a wing/off-ball guard but I think his ceiling is a Mike Conley-type of steady scorer, shooter, and defender. But probably right below All Star level."
"Indy Heat. Mike Conley played with them too. They tore my AAU team up when we played them. Conley was by far the best player on that team, maybe the best in the country. Huntington Express out of WV had Patrick Patterson and OJ Mayo as well."
"Josh Mcroberts, Daquan Cook, Mike Conley, Eric Gordon, and Greg Oden.  I don’t think this is the GOAT aau team just the best from that era."
Mike Conley and the other dude???
"Mike Conley, Eric Gordon, Jeff Teague, George Hill, Gordon Hayward, Josh McRoberts, Greg Oden, E’twan Moore - all Indy boys within ~3 years of each other. The games used to be nutty"
Last Jazz-Celtics game was a Jazz win 122-108 on Feb 9. No Marcus Smart or Mike Conley that game. Will be interesting to see the adjustments.
"7-10 in RPM are Devonte Graham, Mike Conley, Christian Wood, and Lonzo Ball. Even if it regularizes over time, 30 games is pretty solid sample size and none of those guys have been anywhere near Jokic, Dame, Durant, Irving, Kawhi, CP3, and Luka, who are all outside the top 10. RPM just seems like a pretty bad metric."
"I don't know why, but the NBA Second Spectrum has a different defensive rating formula/ranking. Among players with 25+ mpg, this is how the ranking looks like:  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=MIN*GE*25&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Season=2020-21  1. Patty Mills 2. Mike Conley 3. LeBron James 4. Kyle Kuzma 5. Rudy Gobert"
"I'm not your buddy, guy. Lol I'm just saying, clearly Donovan Mitchell is good at basketball or he wouldn't be viewed the way he is. And yeah, I agree Conley and DeMar should have made it, even over Booker. I think Mitchell and Booker are similar. They mostly just score, they're there to take the tough shots. They aren't the ones running their team's offenses and their teams are better for it, in the regular season. However, there's a reason you need those guys when thebplayoffs start and it's harder for a Mike Conley to shoulder the scoring load game to game."
his numbers look worse than Mike's because he plays the most minutes with the bench and Conley plays more with the starters. They need Donovan to score while they lack shot creation so they use Mike to run the offense with all the other good offensive players since he's a classic PG. on off stats are HUGE in these advanced stats comparisons and that's why RAPTOR thinks Conley is better than Donovan.
"Mike Conley, Ja Morant, Kyle Lowry, JJJ, Pau Gasol.  I'm playing Lowry as a big booty 5, and moving JJJ to the 3 and Pau to the 4.  Also I just learned we are historically p good at selecting point guards"
"It depends on how you define things.  If Embiid wins MVP and takes his team to the Finals, we could see his career as being on par with Kevin Durant when he was with OKC.  Now, imagine if Embiid wins MVP, a few championships with the team that drafted him, and DPOY, I think it'd be fair to say that resume surpasses KD's career.  That was where Greg Oden was projected to go.    Until this season, people have forgotten what a superstar big man can do during their prime years.  Oden was projected to have that offensive capability that Jokic and Embiid have demonstrated while also being a perennial DPOY.    All that with elite athleticism and point guard skills (ex. during NBA Combine, he was faster than Mike Conley and could keep up with point guards during dribbling drills).  It's very much possible."
"I think you’re overstating the leverage the raptors have. At the end of the day, lowry is 35 and on an expiring contract. He’s an obvious and great fit for the sixers, for sure, but my previous statement stands and there’s not really any teams that would make sense for lowry that can beat the sixers offer. Closer to a Mike Conley package makes sense."
"Yes, easily. The adjustments do sound excessive until you look at the data without it. LEBRON is fairly similar to PIPM(even if they didnt explicitly say so on the podcast) with one of the relatively few significant differences being the role adjustment. That was one of the issues with PIPM you had guys like Duncan Robinson still being way too high. You can order with the specific order of the top 25 or whatever in O-LEBRON that's all fair game but the actual players that consist of the top 25 are in line with what they should be in reality in no small part because of role adjustments.   EPM is also better it's pretty similar to what the old RPM model was back when it was good. RAPTOR is just trying to do too much, stuff like incorporating tracking data which it's very much TBD if it actually helps improve your model and its validity or if its just noise. Trying to do all that stuff is part of what screwed up RPM. It also just fails a bunch of super basic face validity type tests like having Mike Conley way too high defensively because he shares 90+% of his minutes with Rudy Gobert."
Mike Conley finally being the Mike Conley Utah thought he would be when they traded for him has made a huge difference to their team
It's always been Andre miller even before mike Conley was an allstar   Other than That Al Jefferson was also always a bigger snub than Conley
"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/2/23/22298428/mike-conley-all-star-reservers-snub  He crunched the numbers. Now stop asking the same question every three days, Jesus Christ"
All Star Mike Conley
Man Mike Conley had a half huh
1. I think the overall 3pt% improvement is due to players perceive the rim better with a static background behind it instead of a wave of fans.   2. The players on this this list with the highest % of 3 pointers -unassisted- are:  1. Zach Lavine (48.8% UA)  2. Mike Conley (41.7 UA) 3. CJ McCollum (39.7% 3PUA) 4. Kevin Durant (38.8% 3PUA) 5. Paul George (35.7% 3PUA)  Lavine really stands out here with almost half of his 3s coming unassisted. CJ’s larger volume also means he’s hitting a higher total amount of unassisted 3s in total (hitting 1.9 per game vs Lavine’s 1.7)  To me these are the most impressive shooters on the list. The ability to spot up from 3 unassisted is the most lethal skill out there and you can feel it when those players have the ball.
"Aren't you the same scrub who said Conley is a ""fraud"" because he accepted the All Star nomination???? Lmao, no clue why you have such a hard on for hating on Mike.  All I'm gonna say is, Conley is gonna be an All Star the rest of his life whether you comment on reddit threads about him or not"
"Those were really top heavy classes that didn’t pan out with most of the talent coming from late 1st and 2nd round picks.  ‘04: Dwight Howard, Iguodala, Deng, Al Jefferson were the three stand outs (all 15th or higher)  ‘05: Bogut (#1), Chris Paul (#4), and Gortat (#57) were the ones in this draft.  ‘06: LaMarcus Aldridge (#2), Rudy Gay (#8), Reddick (#11), Rondo (#21), Lowery (#24), and Millsap (#47) slightly deeper but just as many bangers #20 on as there are in the top 20.  ‘07: Durant (#2 — sorry Portland), Al Horford (#3), Mike Conley (#4), Noah (#9), Thad Young (#12), Glen Davis (#35), and of course Marc Gasol (#48).  Edit: autocorrect"
Dejounte’s game is nothing like Mike Conley lol at least when it comes to comparing point guards
You’d be right if all spots were spaced evenly. What I mean by that is the difference between 1 and 10 is... 10 spots. But that difference is way greater than the difference between 10 and 20... also 10 spots.     What I’m trying to say is that Simmons is probably around the 25-30 range of players. A lot of people hype him up to be a bonafide star who belongs in the 15-20 range. It may only be 10 spots but it’s the difference between someone like Kyrie and someone like Mike Conley.
Mike Conley 2.0
Mike Conley
He's not an all-star guys Mike Conley is better
"The All-Star Team is too stacked. Many players are All-Star caliber and ""deserve"" to make the team. Remember, Booker wasn't going to make it. Mike Conley has never won one except on a technicality this year. Tobias may deserve one, but so do BI, Simmons, Tobias Harris, SGA, Bam, Butler, Sabonis, etc."
He's the least efficient 2nd option in the league. His ideal role is closer to a Ricky Rubio than a Mike Conley imo
But he flat out has way better stats than Donovan Mitchell or Mike Conley this year.
"Lakers. I remember jazz vs lakers in the bubble and the commentator said "" what is mike conley even doing here?"" Or something like that"
"They are a team that is probably going to lose in the 2nd round or even the 1st round as presently constituted, but has 80% of a championship puzzle piece completed, and if they traded for Kyle Lowry, I could see them winning it all.   They need that Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday ish type point guard to win a chip, that's the last piece IMO."
Unpopular opinion but I’m just happy Mike Conley made it. I’ve always thought he’s had a better season than Mitchell despite the counting stats
What stat line/record gets SGA to ASG any given year? 30/8/8 and top 5 in the west or would mike Conley still get selected as a replacement over him and derozan?
"I kinda want to see a team of dudes above 30 make a run at the Gold. If that's 12, that would be:  F LeBron James  F Draymond Green  F Jimmy Butler  F Gordon Hayward (he'll be 30 in a few days)  F Kevin Durant   G Chris Paul  G James Harden  G Russell Westbrook  G Stephen Curry  G Mike Conley  C DeAndre Jordan  F/C Blake Griffin  that'd be cool"
Memphis makes the playoffs for the first time in 5 years to get beat by Mike Conley. What a story that would be
Mike Conley plays more off ball than CP3
When Mike Conley outplayed Steph Curry his first game back after a facial fracture. After watching that game I bought a Mike Conley jersey after not having an nba Jersey and that game really made him my favorite player of all time and I’m sure he always will be.
"**TEAM AKUNPOURLIKE30FTTALL**  A new expansion team earns some solid TV rights as the new home of superstar LeBron James. Fellow Ohio hero Mike Conley (former Buckeye) joins him on the venture, representing a near ideal sidekick to the King given his steady play and solid outside shot.  The rest of the team? They have some issues. PG Akunpour and SG Zandrick Ellison understand their role (get the ball to LeBron) well, but SF Mrs. Ellison struggles to understand her own. In fact, she doesn't even understand the rules of basketball. She constantly carries the ball without dribbling, leading to a league high 7.4 turnovers per game.  Opponents feel bad for the 70-year-old lady, not abusing her TOO much on defense. Besides, they have the reddit guards to pick on for that. Defenses routinely score 160-170 points per game against the team, leading to easy win after easy win.  Some media members consider giving LeBron James ""MVP"" based on his workload and great raw stats (57 PPG), but can't do it given the awful team record (2-80)."
Pg: Me   Sg: OP   Sf: Op’s mom  Pf: LeBron  C: Mike Conley
"Chauncey Billups. He is soo good but nobody even talk about him lmao. He is the only guy to have a winning record against MJ, Kobe and lebron. Great playoff performer and player overall. He would be a max in today's league.   Mike Conley. He got his one and only All Star in a very controversial way in his 14th season. But his peak was better than Lowry ever was and Lowry will probably get in to HOF while Conley will not.   Conley had to play in the West and had to play in the worst offense in the league and injuries got to him. If he and Lowry switched sides we would talk absolutely different things about their legacy."
Butler HoF lmao. Holy shit then Mike Conley is a HoF
They should have 4. Mike Conley has been an absolute beast since he’s come to town and Joe Ingles has been snubbed of an allstar appearance these last couple years.
"Because Lavine is shooting the best despite being the opposing team focus.  Mitchell has Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley, Simmons has Joel Embiid and had Jimmy Butler, Brown has Tatum and vice versa and had Kyrie and Hayward, Booker was the same but now he has CP3.  Who was the best teammate Lavine had? Teammates matter and to disregard that is disingenuous to your own argument."
"Dude, there was a brouhaha about whether Mike Conley should be an all star. Imagine if Lebron usurped one of those coveted spots for his kid.  &gt;I doubt even LeGM could find a way to get a high enough pick to get his son on the Lakers.  He could have Bronny tank his value so he falls into the Lakers’ lap. It wouldn’t be easy but it’s not without precedent."
Mike Conley is cool I guess
All Star Mike Conley
What if the Mike Conley shot went in at the end of the Nuggets series?
Mike Conley
Mike Conley
THATS ALLSTAR MIKE FUCKING CONLEY TO YOU
Show me why you got a legacy All Star spot Mike Conley
you know this game is fuckin whack when mike conley is our leader in rebounds and clarkson is our leader in assists
*”nOt BeTter ThAn MiKe CoNlEY”*
"Minutes Played for these teams  Curry (1808), Doncic (1898), Kawhi (1581), Giannis (1713), Jokic (2115)  *Fun fact: these guys are 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th (Luka) on 538's RAPTOR*  Harden (1558), Lillard (1978), LeBron (1388), Zion (1814), Embiid (1316)  *Fun fact: Multiple commenters saying maybe Harden shouldn't make it because he's missed too many games ignoring that he's still 200 minutes ahead of currently-out LeBron and Embiid and only barely behind Kawhi in minutes played. Different position granted, but that's a double standard. Why should some players be able to play significantly less and make the all-NBA team? Yes, LeBron and Embiid are beasts when they play, but Harden's still an amazing player, even if he doesn't need to score as much anymore.*  Kyrie (1585), CP3 (1872), PG13 (1548), Randle (2251!), Gobert (1833)  *Randle currently leads the league in minutes, which Jokic just behind.

Currently listed as week-to-week.*  Best unmentioned players by RAPTOR: Clint Capela, Mike Conley, FVV, Jrue Holiday, Jamal Murray, Draymond Green, Jakob Poeltl, Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, and Thaddeus Young. Anthony Davis (800) and Kevin Durant (812) played too few minutes, but have been effective in their limited time."
"~~To be fair, the BEST players to ever play for the Hornets are probably Dwight Howard and Alonzo Mourning, even if their peaks weren’t with us. Larry Johnson is up there with Kemba in terms of talent when he played with us. But Kemba is the GHOAT because of his longevity with the team, we were the ones who drafted and developed him, he was with us for our 7-59 season,~~  Naw as I was typing that I realized I’m not even gonna defend it, ur right it is hella sad. What a great indictment of our team for Kemba to be out greatest. Even the Timberwolves had Kevin Garnett. The Hornets are just such a depressing franchise to be a fan of.   The only other franchise in a similar situation is probably the Grizzlies, where the greatest player is either Mike Conley or Marc Gasol (idk what Grizzlies fans think, this is just what I’ve seen online). Conley just got his first all-star. Gasol is a 2x All-NBA player, so even that exceeds Kemba by a lot.   At least our colors are dope though"
"Someone should check the fecking Western Conference standings before they make crazy comments. Ja &gt; everybody. Kid is the future. Fox is more like a faster Mike Conley, which is great."
"I see a lot of Mike Conley in him. Good shooter and passer, and has high BBIQ. If he improves defensively he can make some all star games"
"It doesn’t. At the end of the day, all advanced metrics are flawed in the sense that it’s impossible to actually separate your contribution from your teammates over the course of 1 season. You need a 5 year sample size of you playing in a bunch of different line ups to do it properly. The jazz have like the 3rd best offense in the league, gobert plays a lot of minutes and shares those minutes with mike Conley and Donovan mitchell and shooters. It’s also the reason Mike Conley is rated as like a top 3 defender this season in most advanced metrics.  Edit: al horford has certain 5 year rapm samples that he is ranked higher offensively in than any sample of gobert"
"For the longest time the default answer was Mike Conley, but he broke that this year. I’d go with either Richard Jefferson or Cedric Maxwell   Before Mike, it was largely Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain who were considered the GOAT candidates. Way back, probably George Mikan"
Wow he needed mike conley and rich klienman can durant win anything without a super team?
"I worked on this movie, so hopefully can add a little clarity. KD and Mike Conley were brought on as EPs after the film was finished to help with PR (along with Jesse Williams). They did appearances and such while we were pushing the Oscar campaign. They aren't Oscar winners because in the shorts categories, the awards go to the writers/directors rather than the EPs (as is the case for Best Picture)."
Mike Conley to the Nets confirmed
"Kevin Durant, Mike Conley join Kobe Bryant as NBA Oscar winners after 'Two Distant Strangers' takes Best Short  From CBS sports app. Apparently the Oscars going on"
Mike Conley   Donovan Mitchell   Royce O’Neal  Bojan Bogdanovic   Rudy Gobert
David Lee  All-time favorite non-Knick is Mike Conley
"mike conley actually did lol. he talked on jj’s podcast about how him and his wife timed the baby to be born in the offseason, but then covid happened and the baby was born during the bubble playoffs"
Mike Conley is going to be a player that people aren’t going to know existed 20 years from now and the few who do learn about him after he retires will think his best seasons were on the Jazz.
Mike Conley would've been a 6 time all-star in the east
He’s overpaid like how Mike Conley was overpaid  With a big asterisk
I raise you one Mike Conley. Corey Brewer is another one as well
"I mean especially with how fast free agency moves these days, I think a huge part of it for the receiving team is still not having to wait and have your entire free agency ruined while the other team decides if they're matching.   for a team like, say, the Knicks, this could be the difference in whether Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley or Dennis Schroeder are still around."
"What? Gary Payton is always brought up in discussions of the best defensive players ever. Ask some of these nba players now and former players who played against him and ask if he would be a good defender nowadays. IMO Gary would be Kawhi level of defense in 2021 for a guard size. Look at Jrue Holiday,Cp3, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart and Eric Bledsoe to name a few"
"Upvoted as he is bad, but also obligatory wtf is RAPTOR everyone told me 3 months ago that mike Conley being goated this season was due to small sample size but here we are and he’s still 3rd in the league haha"
&gt;most likeable PG   Did Mike Conley die

"That's actually untrue (as Zion, Mike Conley and others with some clutch games under their belt).   Plus there are player way more impactful, but as usual fans/mediocre media personnel, just watch on raw stats... look at the Net Rating or the TS% or even the PIE (not a great stats in general). Dame Lillard and Joel Embiid are beast out there."
mike conley tho

It’s a terrible stat though. It just doesn’t give out logical answers. Hell it had Mike Conley as the best player in the league for half the season
"Mike Conley wouldn't be bad if he won some 'chips and was a lot more popular.  I was actually thinking maybe Walt Frazier.  His numbers aren't *insane* but he was an integral member of championship winning teams, won an AS MVP and probably should have won the Finals MVP in '70 when he had 36/19/7 in that Gm 7 (Jeter has a WS MVP &amp; an AS MVP), and was and is hugely beloved by their team and fans."
Mike Conley has an adorable smile all game long.
Mike Conley if the Griz had a little more playoff success?
"No, it’s on you for stuffing words in my mouth and boiling down my comment to PGs, which insinuated that I was somehow saying Warriors fans would hate someone like Mike Conley. You changed what I was saying into some dumb take that I never made, and then called that take dumb. Last time I checked, that’s the textbook definition of a strawman argument.  &gt;	And you’re surprised your 2 examples get hate from Curry fans  Oh look, another strawman (though not as bad as your last one). When did I say that I’m *surprised* that you all hate on Harden and Lebron? I’m not surprised in the least. I’m just pointing out how Lebron fans and Harden fans don’t shit on Steph anywhere near as much as Steph fans do against those 2, even though each of the 3 fanbases generally hold some animosity towards the other 2 players. It sucks because I like all 3 players. I’ve just noticed the Steph fans are way more toxic. Yes, even more than LeBron’s fans.  Try not to reply with another strawman. You know what would help you to stop stuffing words in people’s mouths? Quoting the part of their comment you’re specifically responding to. That way you won’t end up changing what the other person said and arguing against a take that nobody made.  &gt;	What the fuck are we doing?   Arguing on Reddit because neither of us have anything better to do right now I guess lmao"
Definitely would have been selected over Mike Conley as an injury replacement.
"Conley. He does basketball the right way, called one of most underrated player last decade, now got allstar nod, it's cherry on the top if he gets ring  If Andre Miller cant, i hope Mike gets it"

Beal’s having the same realization Mike Conley had at the ASG - “Steph bout to bufu me on this one”
Mike Conley is nothing?
"Mike Conley to the heat. If dipo is healthy then Miami's starting 5 will be Dipo, Bam, Conley, Jimmy and Duncan."
"Rudy Gobert, Mike Conley and Derrick Favors are AVAILABLE. Ersan Ilyasova is OUT."
"I think the rim avoidance thing Im referring to is more about this   2019: 25.2% of his shots at the rim  This year: 11.2%  It's a big drop off. Only a few guards I see who are lead ball handlers/initiators around that level. CJ McCollum, Chris Paul, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell. CP3 is a historic level outlier. CJ is dynamic off the ball as a weapon. Conley I think is a better floor general and passer out of the P/R we dont really think of him as a scoring guard per se. There just alot of plays with Kemba you see him drive and not taking the shot at the rim at the big. It just changes how dangerous a weapon he is and how difficult he is to defend, can focus alot more on just chasing him off the 3 point line. He's still a good weapon and important to that team. I just think the fit issues wouldnt as big a thing if this was the Kemba of 2-3 yrs ago, he would stress the defense in a way it would create alot for others even if its not through his assists per se."
"&gt; Over their four games last week, the Jazz were more than 29 points per 100 possessions better with Gobert on the floor (+14.1) than they were with him off the floor (-15.3)  Just unbelievable. Gobert has a total +/- of 550 this season, nearly 100 more than #2 Mike Conley and 163 more than #3 Kawhi"
There was a year where it was spurs-grizzlies in the playoffs I saw kawhi leonard absolutely take over at the end of a game on both sides of the ball and close out the game while on the other side mike conley was doing everything he could to keep up it was amazing basketball
Mike Conley got an allstar spot over De'Aaron Fox 🙂
Mike Conley
" Conley, Tony Allen, Rudy Gay, Pau, Marc  Shareef ""OG Curry"" Abdur-Raheem, Mike Miller, Shane Battier, Zbo, Big Country Reeves is the second unit."
"They have Mike Conley.  Wouldn't be at all surprised if they win 5 of the next 6, if not all of em.  Plus several others who can run PG."
"Shoutout to Marc Gasol and Mike Conley, Grit And Grind era"
"I'm here to watch my favorite players Lebron James, Donovan Mitchell, Anthony Davis and Mike Conley. Hope it's a good one."
"Mike Conley has sat one game of almost every back-to-back ever since he injured his hamstring earlier this year. The only time he didn't was last week. He played yesterday, so no playing today.

Ok let's talk about Eric Bledsoe over Mike Conley and Melo
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
"2015? You mean when mike conley and toney Allen got hurt? How was that evenly matched? And the 2015 rockets? We were missing 2 starters, it was basically harden vs 3 all nba ers. 37 year old Terry was guarding curry. Everyone knew they’d win.  We were less talented in 2018 and they only won because cp3 went down. An actual example of this would have been the 2016 okc series which slipped my mind, but other then that curry has never been on a team with even comparable talent to the opposition since 2015"
Mike Conley uses the floater a good amount
Tony Parker was the guy who was awesome with the floater and also Mike Conley used it heavy with the off hand too.
"Yes... Like anybody else at that time, I was desperately hoping somebody would beat that Heat team, and so I would latch onto any team that in theory could have a chance, which is why I liked the Bulls at that time.  But honestly, give me any kind of argument as to why Rose would be better than any of those players? He might be a better scorer than some of them, but he's not a better passer than any of them, and he's a worse shooter than all except Russ.   It's not really an indictment against him, it's just we've seen a ridiculous gen of point guards this last decade. Great players like Lowry, John Wall, Mike Conley don't even sniff this discussion."
Derrick Rose. Without the injuries he would have been able to resign with CHI at the max right when the 2016 cap spike hit. He likely would've gotten the Mike Conley $150M treatment.
"I find it interesting that Mike Conley got in the all star game in the West, while Jrue went to the “easier” East and didn’t get in, even though both players are very similar offensively."
Yeah no he's similar to a guy like Mike Conley where he was really good just had better peeps around him
"He’s so smooth, like Mike Conley kinda, and hes got elite passing vision already as a 19 year old. He’s so fun to watch, throwing crazy dimes every play. Also a very strong &amp; active defender, and at 6’5 he could be an amazing defensive PG. Sky is the limit for the kid, but he’s gotta shoot better &amp; be more aggressive but it’ll come with time."
"If it makes you feel better, Mike Conley is a year younger than me."
Is this the EPM where Mike Conley is 4th in the NBA?
"   &gt;Would you take D'Lo over any of the following players? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Malcolm Brogdon, Mike Conley, Lonzo Ball, Dejounte Murray   &gt;   &gt;If you answered yes to any of those then you're the one overrating DLo.     What is this crap? YOU are the one underrating Dlo, Lonzo is certainly not better than Dlo, Murray isnt, maybe Conley is, and Shai is."
"Yes I'd take Dlo over Lonzo Ball and Dejounte Murray. Maybe even Mike Conley.   Lonzo plays with Zion and B.I so gets goods looks from 3s. He wishes he is even half the offensive player Dlo is, and his half-court offense doesn't even compare to Dlo's. I'll take Zo for the rebounds and defense though."
"&gt; nobody overrates dlo   Anyone who thinks he's good is PG is overrating him. Casual fans still consider him a star.  Would you take D'Lo over any of the following players? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Malcolm Brogdon, Mike Conley, Lonzo Ball, Dejounte Murray  If you answered yes to any of those then you're the one overrating DLo."

"I didn’t push him over Kobe. I gave you a fact but you’re a hater so of course you’re looking for reasons to justify why you have ho tendencies.  Surely you’re not saying Pat Bev in a gentleman’s sweep is major. Surely you’re not saying Jrue Holiday in a sweep is major. Surely Mike Conley missing one game and coming back to play better isn’t what you’re talking about, but you are. You see I watch games and know the context. Why were they not the favorites if it was so obvious? He beat everybody else on the 1st team that year on his way to his first ring.  Surely Tragic Bronson never happened, surely the Lakers Pistons never happened, surely the Heat Mavs never happened. None of these players great anymore according to you ?  Surely signing the biggest free agent is something literally any team would do given the opportunity right ?  Averaged 32PPG on efficiency Kobe literally never saw in his career and you want to knock it because of what ? Because you hate him and discredit everything he does. You deny it because you recognise it’s stupid af lol. Why not just stop ?  Kobe was my favorite player from 02-09. You see I can appreciate great play because I love basketball and actually played it.   You’re a casual my man. Imagine having nothing but disdain for a guy with a career as incredible as this man lol. And then claiming to be a knowledgeable basketball fan. Clown shit."
"A lot of the ones using On/Off data get sort of skewed because Mike is replaced by Jordan Clarkson a lot of the time, and at the same time Gobert takes a seat.  The on/off data sees the defensive dropoff from losing Gobert and  Clarkson entering and assigns too much of it to Conley."
The Jazz have 2 players more valuable than Giannis according to RAPTOR and neither of them are Donovan Mitchell lol.    Mike Conley is supposedly better offensively and defensively than Giannis.
"Embiid vs Jokic is such a fun debate. On one hand Embiid is a superior defender, but on the other hand, Jokic is an offensive engine who elevates his teammates' games. If your team has someone who can dictate the pace and flow of an offense a la Jrue Holiday or Mike Conley, then I see how you pick Embiid. On the other hand, if need someone who can elevate the players on the floor to that next level with a team being primarily composed of shooters, defenders, and no primary playmakers, I see how Jokic is an easy choice. It's a treat for us as fans to have two supremely talent but unique centers playing at the same time."
"Also, replacing Rubio and Crowder with much more consistent shooters in Conley &amp; Bojan was massive.  At least once Mike adjusted."
"jesus Jrue so fucking good, like hell if u argue Mike Conley underrated or should be all-star. Jrue Holiday is so far better."
"&gt;Are you comparing Tim Duncan to Mike Conley?  You realize he retired by 2016 because he got played off the court by Steven Adams?  In 2011 he got annihilated by Z-Bo-MG, he was the 3rd best big on the floor that series.  In the playoffs dudes like Ibaka-Perkins were having games where they shot 18-20, 90% against him &amp; Ibaka had a historical 12-12 100% shooting game.  Please stop pretending this is prime TD from 2004 a decade earlier, its insulting.    Kawhi came alive in the playoffs when TP was injured &amp; Pop was forced to play him, check his stats against Miami.  Like I said nobody was a top 10-15 player, the most productive LA was there was a 23-8rpg player, hardly superstar."
"Are you comparing Tim Duncan to Mike Conley? Duncan was getting MVP votes, All NBA selections and All Defense selections while Kawhi was his teammate. Do you think Kawhi was carrying the 2014 Spurs to their championship that year or something? He only averaged 13 ppg that year.   Tony Parker also made no fewer than 3 All NBA teams as Kawhi's teammate. LaMarcus Aldridge was All NBA twice as Kawhi's teammate, and once finished top 10 in MVP voting before Kawhi left. Kyle Lowry is a 6x All Star, including the one year he was with Kawhi.  Then we have Mike Conley, who's never made an All NBA team and this year made his first All Star team as an injury replacement. You're way off here, sorry. Kawhi has had *plenty* of help in his career."
"I'm talking about top 10 players, don't play dumb like you can't tell the difference between a Mike Conley &amp; a Curry.  PG the only one &amp; he always turns into ""playoff P"".  Go look at lists of top 10 players from the years he played with them, most guys weren't even top 5 at their respective positions."
Jrue holiday  Chris Paul  Kyle Lowry   Ben Simmons  Mike Conley  Even Steph curry is able to play solid defense while running around a zillion screens
I don't actually think this but I'd find it funny if it was some dude who just seems mild mannered all the time like Mike Conley or Duncan Robinson or something.
Mike Conley. But Pau Gasol and Zach Randolph also have arguments.
"Every player has done a dirty play here or there if his career is long enough (extreme cases like Mike Conley being the exception).  If we're talking about malign, i don't think i can think of a single malign Westbrook play right now, no."
Getting beaten up by Mike Conley pnr was brutal.
"Man, Memphis couldn't stop annyyyttthhhiiinnnggg in the 4th quarter. Felt like Utah hit every shot they took.  Utah is going to have a huge math advantage with how many 3s they take. 8-23 vs. 19-39 3pt shooting is just a recipe for disaster unless you're: crashing the offensive glass (they weren't), generating a lot of transition points (not so much), and making life miserable in the defensive paint (***OOF***). Memphis's chance of winning these games totally falls apart if they're losing the possession game.   I'm also not sure what Taylor Jenkins is going to do about the Conley-Gobert pick-and-roll. Gobert opening up that 4th quarter with a couple of dunks and a block gave Utah all the juice it needed to go on that big 10-0 run.  Ultimately, I like Memphis's chance to push this series to 6 games, but I think their chance to steal this series is cooked. They're going to have to squeeze out every ounce  of the margins to win against this team, and I just don't think they have the experience to pull that off.  Also, there's a lot of talk about how Mitchell opened up the offensive game for Utah, but put some more love on that dude Mike Conley. In two games so far, he's got 26 assists and only 4 turnovers."
"Alright, so [here are the matchup stats after last night.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629630/head-to-head/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;Matchup=Offense&amp;sort=MATCHUP_FG_PCT&amp;dir=1)  Most of Ja's shots have been defended by Mike Conley, against whom Ja's shooting 63%. He's also shooting 63% against Derrick Favors.  Against Gobert? 38%.  Granted, there's some nuance there, since that data only looks at primary defenders, and much of the time Gobert is a help defender in the paint. Still - this is another data point indicating Gobert is, in fact, negatively impacting Ja."
"The plan is once Conley wins a couple rings with us, we’re going to graciously trade him back to Memphis for Ja, so Mike can retire there. We are good people."
"As a former average highschool wrestler, I’m not sure I share your confidence  EDIT: I do think I could beat up Mike Conley tho"

Mike Conley getting to the paint was our biggest weakness as well
Conley with 20/15 is something to talk about. Donovan played great in his limited time but Mike made everything happen.
"1. Magic Johnson  2. LeBron James  3. Luka Doncic  4. Ja Morant  What is this a list of? Youngest players with 40 points in the playoffs. Future is bright in Memphis.  But Mike Conley just knows how to close games. 14 assists with only two turnovers, and 20 points as well. His two man game with Gobert was their main weapon in the 4th.  God damn I hope this series goes 7 games"
Mike Conley just knows how to close games. Has too much experience advantage over Ja.  But we've shown so much fight. I hope this series goes 7 games
"By RAPTOR, Mike Conley is one of the best 5 defenders in the league.  And Ja is cooking him. It's remarkable."
We're used to seeing Mike Conley close out games... why you gotta do it to us Mike!
Mike Conley the only player to get an all star selection out of pity
IIRC the Grizzlies were the last 8 seed to have beaten a 1 seed and of course Mike Conley was a big part of that. How the turn tables
"He headbutted Mike Conley (wasn't really that bad tbh) and smack talked pretty hard last game, BUT his flop against the Utes from his college days is going around again too. College ball is pretty big in UT"
I know Mike Conley feel weird af rn just by playing against the Grizzlies
Mike Conley really was an allstar this season
Ricky rubio could be a good playmaker for them? What about Mike conley
PG - Ja Morant SG - Tony Allen SF - Sharief Abdur Rahim PF - Zach Randolph C - Marc Gasol Ultimate Backup Pg Mike Conley
"Completely agree. I think going for a Kyle Lowry or even Mike Conley (if he leaves Utah) this off-season would make sense for them. Plus getting a big that can spread the floor, create a pick and pop option for Zion to create with, unlike Adams and Hayes."
"Mike Conley and his off-hand floaters  Lamelo’s underhanded full-court outlet pass was also insane, would be nice if he makes it a more common thing."
"Sadly that's what people do not understand. They feel like JC won just because of PPG, and blames his usage rate as the outcome of his selfishness or whatever. But the Jazz on the other hand is like crying for help from their abysmal bench (and sometime their starter offense too, apart from Mitchell).  Remember, the Mike Conley acquisition appears to be a flop on the first year. Of course now it works beautifully after a year of acclimation, but last year things were certainly iffy for them like do the Jazz already reached their peak as nothing but a 5th seed at best? JC of all people stabilized their offense, giving Spida some help."
"Maybe somewhere inbetween Buddy Hield and Mike Conley. Not an all-star but a bonafide starter whose skillset was considered very valuable. He was a top 10 pick out of UNC, won a 3-point contest, and was a big part of a decently popular team in the 90's.  It's difficult to compare popularity since there are so many more NBA fans nowadays, but Kenny was probably top 50-100 most well known players in the 90's."
"Ive worked with David Locke limitedly  over the past 10 years, and let me tell you, he is the biggest asshole I have ever had the displeasure of being around. Radio “talent” have a reputation of being big headed tools, but David takes the cake. Imagine if Patrick Bateman (American Psycho) decided he wanted to start calling basketball games, and that’s pretty much the deal.  I have a lot of respect for the Jazz as an organization, and I fucking love mike Conley obviously, this isn’t about us playing them in the first round. David Locke is just a dick, lol."
Seriously nobody even seemed to care he headbutted the nicest man on earth for no reason. I demand justice for Mike Conley!!
"this is seriously getting overblown. Dillon Brooks looks up to Mike Conley, Dillon was his rook in Memphis. that head butt wasn't even aimed at Conley's head, he butted him in the chest. I doubt that hurt, that was just a friendly ""just cause we used to be teammates, I'm still coming at you"" gesture more than a cheap shot. right before that Dillon and Conley had a friendly exchange of trash talk. it was a nothing burger but cause it was Dillon Brooks, ppl are assuming it had bad intentions behind it"
Mike Conley be like “My injury was a 100 times worse.”

Random but did anyone see Dillon Brooks headbutt Mike Conley? It feels weird nothing happened with that? John Starks definitely got ejected from a playoff game with the Pacers for doing something similar to Reggie Miller but Reggie obviously sold it well lmao.
Poor Mike Conley lol
"Memphis: After all this time Mike?  Conley: Um, sorry but-  Clarkson: Always."
Mike Conley and Bogdan used to be able to play inside but they seem unable to get into rhythm there. That's a problem.
Never forget Mike Conley finessed an All Star spot. No excuses.
Mike Conley doing his best 2014 Manu impression.
"https://mobile.twitter.com/my_lo/status/1396656711595819009  Brooks headbutting Mike Conley, the nicest guy in the league."
Imagine if Mike Conley lost in the playoffs to Memphis.
Mike Conley could probably sue Brooks for assault
Great. Hope so. You don't get to that level without being an elite player. People aren't irrationally hating mike conley or alex caruso. if he becomes as hated as harden is that only means positive things for him as a player and in turn the Hawks as a team.
JJJ so trash this game hope he improves more but fuck man just box out you let them rebound 2 mike conley bricks
fucking mike conley is torching us on every possible area
"did reggie say ""michael conley""? I get that mike is short for michael but sounded weird lol"
What happened there with Mike Conley and Dillon Brooks??
Either this going to be a Jonas (Chucks's voice) Valanciunas or Mike Conley Jr game.
"In order (that are under 6’2):  1. Chris Paul  2. Kyle Lowry  3. Mike Conley    They just play smart and don’t make many mistakes. They all aren’t defensive liabilities either even though they’re under-sized compared to a lot of the newer combo guard type of guys. I’d say what sets them apart is their leadership and IQ on the floor. CP3 is the point god and an all-time great floor general. Lowry is the heart and soul of Toronto. Conley is a bit more under the radar, but he’s literally been awarded for his likability as a teammate and sportsman."
"Joe isn't a ""master of none"", he's one of the best PnR ball handlers in the league, a great playmaker, excellent defender, and among league leaders in 3p% on pretty substantial volume.   Clarkson is attempting almost 9 3PAs per game, Ingles is attempting a touch over 6. Ingles is getting around 8.3ppg off of his threes. Clarkson, with *three more attempts a night* is averaging only about 9.2 points from threes each game. Clarkson is on average shooting close to twice as much as Ingles is but only averaging six more points.   Clarkson is a very valuable sparkplug off the bench, but to compare him to Mitchell's role is just not reasonable. They're both talented isolation scorers, but Mitchell is a substantially better shooter, he's more talented at relocating off the ball, and he's a much more gifted playmaker, not to mention the fact that he can play above the rim as well. While you're correct to say that Mitchell is often the focal point of the opposing defense, Clarkson very rarely is. Usually the focal point of the defense when Clarkson and Ingles share the floor is Mike Conley, because those two are part of the Jazz bench lineup of death that includes Mike, Rudy, and Niang. In fact, that's the Jazz' second most played lineup.   In that lineup, Clarkson gets a lot of shots only because he's a convenient guy to dump the ball off to when a play falls apart, but his shot is dramatically worse in terms of efficiency or quality than the shots that *any other guy on the floor* will be taking. Mike is more efficient from just about everywhere on the floor, Joe is better in the PnR and behind the arc, and Niang is a really gifted 3p% guy as well. Obviously Rudy is insanely efficient as a lob threat and roll man too, so they'd rather run that kind of a play instead. Joe is a *huge* part of why that lineup works so well - if you can force the ball out of Mike's hands, it goes to a guy who is *just as good of a playmaker* as the starting pointguard, and is still an incredibly lethal scorer.   Clarkson is an important guy, obviously, and he serves a valuable function, but to claim that he is the focal point of the team's offense is ludacris when you realize that in the most common lineup he plays in, an isolation is *at best* the fifth option after a lob to Rudy, catch-and-shoot attempts by any of the three other shooters on the floor, a pick-and-roll, or a Conley isolation. If the ball ever touches Clarkson's hands, and it's not an immediate catch-and-shoot situation, that is a sign that the play has failed, and that they need to put it in the hands of the guy who is the best at making inefficient shots. He does not make his teammates better, and he is not the catalyst for what transformed our bench unit to be as effective as it has been this season. Those factors were Conley and Ingles."
Mike Conley sleeper agent activated.
"Jazz-Grizz series will 100% be 4-1.  If there was ever a team that would make sure to win via the ""gentleman's sweep"", it's a Mike Conley Jazz team vs. his former beloved Grizzlies."
"We last saw him as Mike Conley. Now we will meet, All Star Mike Conley. Love you, Mike."
"Yeah but you forgot that when they say the secret code phrase, double agent Mike Conley will spring into action. 6 on 4, Grizzlies take game 1, then it's a race to see if the Jazz can deprogram him before game 2."
&gt;Fuck all of r/nba &gt; &gt;Mike Conley &gt; &gt;Tolerating Grayson Allen  Jazz fans 🤝 Grizz fans
"As someone who saw Draymond cheapshot Mike Conley in his fractured face, then retreat when Zbo approached him to ease tensions, no."
us grizz fans will not allow slander on any team that mike conley is in
"I’m sorry I just came here to vent.   Why are people bashing the Grizzlies/ Jazz series?   Will it be a sweep? Probably, Probably not.   But I feel this is much better than whatever we would’ve gotten with the Warriors.   This is the same shit that got Steph that damn MVP nod. (I know he had a god like year) but the fans are like “no ones watching Jazz/Grizzlies”   yea it doesn’t have a true superstar in it. But still bro it’s basketball stop bitching about the series if you aren’t gonna watch it. I wanna see Valanciunas vs Gobert , Mike Conley going back to Memphis. Kyle Anderson vs Joe ingles.   TF? What’s all this complaining about?   I hate this meat riding ass league and it’s fans sometimes man damn"
"Average is a surprisingly high bar in the NBA. I feel like I can name 15 better passers than Steph. In no particular order (mostly going by team record this year), Mike Conley, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, James Harden, Jokic/Lebron if they count, Trae Young, Doncic, Lillard, Morant, Westbrook, Rubio, Lamelo, Lowry, Vanvleet and Wall is 16. I’d probably put Derozan as well but idk if I’d call him a point guard."
MEGA MIKE CONLEY
Grizzlies fans how do you feel about facing Mike Conley?  Be honest.
Mike Conley!
"If the Grizz hold on, the Utah-Memphis is going to be both fanbases sucking off Mike Conley.  And I'm already waiting in line, baby."
1. David Lee 2. Mike Conley 3. Charlie Ward 4. Allan Houston 5. Brandon Roy 6. Michael Redd 7. Tony Allen 8. Larry Johnson 9. Jamal Crawford 10. Rasheed Wallace
Double agent Mike Conley throws the game and the grizzlies sweep. But seriously if we make it to the playoffs Gobert is going to shut down our entire offense and we prolly get swept
Then we get the epic Mike Conley vs. Memphis storyline.
Mike Conley making his return to Memphis in the playoffs ;)
Mike Conley having to oust his old team. Playing two playoff games in a house he helped build.
"If I recall correctly something happened like that in a Wolves/Jazz game this year. The Wolves up by 3 decided to internationally foul but I can’t remember who, what I do remember is that whoever it was missed the second free throw hard off the rim and it went off a Wolves player. Jazz got the ball back down 2 and Mike Conley ended up hitting a 3 to take the lead, but D’Lo hit a game winning layup at the other end anyway."
Mike Conley contesting the trademark claim already
I want to see it. Ja Morant is a beast and the JV vs Rudy matchup will be fun. Mike Conley against his old team is also an intriguing subplot.
bruh this reminds me of the mike conley / z-bo Grizzlies. awesome atmosphere.
I always liked Mike Conley in 2k12. His off the dribble fade away three was unguardable
Many people don't remember but he had the same stat line as Mike Conley at the time before his major injury in new Jersey.
"cp3 has had his share of playoff flameouts.  I remember realizing Mike Conley was really legit waaaay back when simply because of how he outplayed chris paul in their playoff matchup.  Even last year, while he was incredible against HOU in game 6, he basically choked in game 7."
For some. Players like mike Conley have been in the league for many years and still are down to earth
"Well, yeah, he would have to do some meaningful winning to become a perennial All Star lol... I’m not saying that you haven’t, but if you watch Fox somewhat regularly I don’t think you’d call him a fringe All Star. I know r/NBA doesn’t like counting stats, and being the best player on a bad team makes up for a little bit of this, but dude averaged 25/4/7 in his fourth season. Compare that to an infamous fringe All Star, Mike Conley, who averaged 16/4/6. And Fox is only getting better."
"I'll assume this is a good faith question, but you should know you're getting downvoted because stating opinions about a team which you self-admittedly don't watch is not a good basis for your opinions.  That being said, Gobert has a bigger offensive role than people think (including you apparently), and it's not just measured in points. Other players picked up the slack with Donovan and Conley out. Clarkson, Ingles, and Bojan all took a bigger role and have played really well. But we have struggled at times without Don and Mike and it's obvious. Will be glad to have them both back."
"I think Thibs should win, because we had no projected talent on our squad. We didn't pick up anyone in recent years that was projected to be an all star or was in discussions of being an all star (Suns CP3, Jazz Mike Conley, BKN KD, Kyrie, Harden).   My biggest problems with people stating quinn or monty should win is that they do not even mention nash or doc.   People want to give the award to quinn, because of best record and when donavan went down, utah still ended up being first. Nash had KD injured the entire middle of the season, harden got injured the end of the season, and kyrie went AWOL during the beginning of the season before the harden trade and the Nets still got within 4 games of the best overall record. This was Nash's first year as a coach, first year KD and Kyrie get to play together, first year KD, Kyrie, and Harden get to play together and they were injured all the time. You want to discount Nash's coaching efforts because he has 3 all stars on the team? Then why cant we discount quinn's efforts because he had 3 all-stars on the team (Mitchell, Conley, Gobert). The knicks had no all stars before this year and got 1 this year. Suns had 2 all stars, and CP3 has been known for changing the culture of projected losing organizations into winning cultures - carried the hornets, turned the clippers into lob city, went toe to toe against the KD warriors and if not for cp3's injury, probably would have won the series, and last season turned the lottery bound thunder into the 5 seed. But yeah lets give all/most credit to Monty.   I think the Knicks and Hawks made the biggest jump with the least amount of talent. I don't see how anyone could favor Monty, personally, with CP3 effect there, and Quinn's coaching obstacles were of a lesser degree than what Nash had to deal with. If you want to give Quinn because he had the best overall record, that's fine i guess."
"Where are you getting the Lonzo comparison?  I plugged in the range Schroeder hit during that stretch of season into the NBA stats page and found if he could stretch out those numbers (16-20 points, 6-10 assists) during a full season his peers would be FVV, Ja, Jrue, Darius Garland, Lowry, CP3, and Mike Conley.  I’m not saying he affects winning like Lowry, CP3, or Conley; but *if Schroeder could stretch that production to a full season* he has a statistical argument for being a top 12-15 PG"
"Look I get you guys are knicks fans and I know the feeling of going from a laughingstock to a legitimately good team, it's an awesome feeling. I'm not saying the knicks haven't had a great season or aren't a great story, I just have a different philosophy on what level improvement is impressive. Also you guys are downplaying how hard it is to go from a good team to elite, which isn't fair to the Jazz or their fans. Playing at a level near the Warriors or the MJ Bulls is absurd, especially if all you did is add a player like Mike Conley (who's no Kevin Durant).  I just think it's way harder to go from a good team to elite than what the knicks did. I still think Randle should be MIP and that Thibs has proven all of his doubters wrong (I was one of them)."
"&gt; Well, if you truly believe that Conley is all star caliber  I don't need to believe anything, it's a literal fact that Mike Conley was an all-star this season.    &gt; If you have three all star players then being a contender is the bare minimum on Snyder’s part.  Conley was seen as one of the worse contracts in the league coming into this season.  Snyder deserves some credit for his improving to the point where he made the all-star game.    Oh, and Randle was an all-star this season too.  Making the playoffs with an all-star isn't as impressive as your whole 'he DiD iT witH noThiNg buT caSTOffs' routine."
More impressive is the 39 alleyoops that Gobert throw to Mike Conley.
"&gt;Most prolific alley-oop duo (credit to lactardenthusiast for the idea)  &gt;**Clint Capela &amp; Trae Young (69)**  &gt;Mike Conley &amp; Rudy Gobert (39)  &gt;DeAndre Jordan &amp; James Harden, **John Collins &amp; Trae Young (32)**  &gt;Deandre Ayton &amp; Devin Booker (31)  Damn! I watch the Hawks, and even I didn’t notice how many oops compared to the rest of the league that Trae connects on. There’s a new lob city now!"

"Really just Mike Conley who isn't tied up long term from the core. And given the season we've had I'd hope he wants to stay.   I wouldn't say we're favorites to make it out of the West, but honestly every team has question marks around them. Suns and Jazz are relatively unproven, Clips have a lot of doubt around them given how they went out last year, Nuggets are missing Murray, and we're not really sure if Lebron and AD will be 100% in the playoffs. I think we have a realistic chance, and as a fan that's all I can ask for.   Gonna be a great playoff tournament I think. Gonna be stressful AF as a Jazz fan but it should be great."
Brogdon feels a bit like the new Mike Conley where he's just *solid* at every part of being a point guard but not overwhelmingly spectacular at any given part of the game either.
Mike Conley is a pretty good defender no?
"For the last 5 years Definitely remembered: LeBron, Curry, Giannis, Durant, Klay, Davis, Lillard, Harden, Russ, CP3, Embiid, Kyrie, Wade, Kobe  Likely remembered: Jokic, Tatum, Korver, Griffin, Derrick Rose, Donovan Mitchell  Potentially forgotten: Jimmy Butler, Kemba, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Bradley Beal, Al Horford, Devin Booker  Likely forgotten: Lowry, Aldridge, Millsap, Kevin Love, Marc Gasol, Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall, Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert"
"I don’t trust nba height/weight stats at all. I worked at a nice restaurant frequented by nba players so I’ve stood by a ton of them. Mike Conley listed as 6”1 175 is so off. He is 6 ft at best and was so skinny. 165 at best. Also Marc Gasol is the biggest human being I’ve ever met. Like, how are we the same species?"
Our announcer started it last year after a game when we were wearing our throwback purple mountain jerseys. Conley had a good game and Mountain Mike was born. Conley is the type of player that doesn't need a nickname and nothing would ever suit him.
"""Mountain Mike"" Conley"
"I'll respectfully disagree. It's not really an issue of how much he scores It's moreso with how limited he is able to score. He's limited as a roll man and lob threat and without a playmaker to set him up(which is being largely exposed so far this series without Mike conley) he struggles. His gravity and it's value as a roll man is largely exaggerated due to this and he's still not a good free throw if/when he gets to the line. I'd argue Don just having the ball opens up just as much if not more for his teammates.   The clippers are consistently playing a very small ball lineup without any actual rim protectors. And he isn't able to take advantage of that mismatch while his teammate a whole foot shorter has. He's struggled in this series offensively without a playmaker that can set him up.  And Don is much more than an initiator and escape plan. In the playoffs he's the focal point of this team's offense. And it's just my opinion that being able to provide efficient, high volume, and self created offense is more valuable in the playoffs."
"i think if Donovan is good and Mike Conley plays i think we *can* take game 4. Workin against health now.. but Don says were good.  Had too many turnovers, alot of defensive breakdowns, and obviously wouldve benefitted from more Donovan.   Clippers stars obviously did what they do, but we let Reggie, Morris, Batum, and P Bev walk all over us. If we clean up the turnovers which caused 20+ points and can play somewhat competent defense on the clippers as a whole, we can and should be able to close out this series"
Where is Mike Conley
"Mike Conley was, once again, greatly missed. Niang and Oni don't need that many minutes, even as little as they got."
I don't know if the Jazz  will make it through with out their all-star guard; Mike Conley better be coming back soon
"This game is such a disappointment. I tuned in to watch the Jazz put a beat down but damn, Clippers totally owned Jazz.   &amp;#x200B;  * Utah needs to play Mike Conley game 4 no excuses * Snyder needs to make faster in game adjustments instead of letting a bench player like Niang kill all momentum with 3 turnovers and a fouls within 2 min time span * Don't just settle for contested 3s. Move the ball around and find the open shooter. Today's shooting was completely different from game 1 and 2 * Golbert needs to be more aggressive and get those offensive rebounds... HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR KAWHI TO OUT REBOUND YOU?!"
"Ok Utah, even if Mike Conley is only 80% y'all better play him in game 4 because you can't let the Clippers tie this up. Snyder needs to make in game adjustments a lot faster.   &amp;#x200B;  He let Niang and Favors single handedly cost Jazz 5 turnovers within 3 minutes. Cut all momentum and let Clippers balloon lead from 8 to 18... Snyder really needs to make adjustments when he sees a bench player having a Paul George choke moment."
"Feels like I've heard ""Michael Conley"" 100 more times than usual since Michael ""It's Michael not Mike"" Malone complained about how they call him"
Can anyone tell me how much longer Mike Conley is supposed to be out for?
"Is it just me, or does it seem like Mike Conley's hamstring may be getting a lot healthier tonight?     For non-Jazz fans that don't know, Utah is historically ridiculously conservative with injuries. Conley will be magically 100% if they lose tonight."
Sources say Mike Conley suddenly feeling ready to play
Wonder if the Jazz will roll with Mike Conley game 4
When is Mike Conley expected to be back?
If Mike Conley is healthy this series changes
Without mike Conley tho
Is Mike Conley ok? It's been like a week.
1. Mike Conley 2. Mike Conley 3. Mike Conley 4. Mike Conley  5. Donovan Mitchell
Donovan Mitchell  Mike Conley  Rudy Gobert Joe Ingles  That's 4  Bojan Bogdanovich is borderline.
"Lol, they're missing Mike conley buddy."
Lol do you not remember last year when Morris stepped on luka ankle like 6 times lmao. Playoff p has played like for along time now in the playoffs. He has shown that’s who he is in the playoffs. Kawhi is getting locked up. Mike Conley isn’t even playing lol
Fuck it. 30 bucks on Mike Conley
"I mean Mitchell is a pretty damn good player, but I feel like sometimes they rely to heavily on him to play hero ball (part of that is Mitchell's fault). If Mitchell has a bad game and the role players dont hit threes, im not sure if the other guys can carry the team (dont get me wrong, Mike Conley, Ingles, Clarkson, Bojan, and Rudy are all great players.    This is just what it looks like to me in the playoffs, if it was different in the regular season feel free to let me know (especially jazz fans cuz u guys know a lot more than me)."
"I feel like he's also exploded as a scorer this year. He was previously a high volume guy, but he added efficiency and a much better three point shot. I still don't see him as a point guard, but that's why they got Mike Conley. This team is only going to get better when Conley returns to health."
"Woops. I have two accounts cause I'm lazy. I'm a Jazz fan though.  Honestly, I really like this iteration of the thunder. Dort is awesome and going to make a big splash in the league.  I get why you hate the Jazz though, that was a very heated rivalry. This iteration of Jazz are great. Mike Conley is the nicest guy. Royce and Joe were nobodies. Bojan is the definition of stamina. Rudy has always played with a chip on his shoulders. I could go on.. anyway, hope you enjoy the rest of the playoffs."
"Especially when you consider that the Jazz do not have their All Star point guard Mike Conley.  Another scorer, passer, leader, and defender.   This is why it was so important for the Clippers to steal game 1 or 2, because Utah is not at full strength.   Utah also played their worst first half of the playoffs in game 1."
Mike Conley missed multiple bubble games in the playoffs to see his baby's birth.
"His lack of shooting hurts him. We also never get to see what a peak Rose would look like since he got hurt so many times, so his MVP season was his best version of himself.    IMO, many versions of Curry and CP3 &gt;&gt; Rose.   I’d take Dame too. Dame’s shooting just gives him a big edge over Rose. I’d also lean Westbrook. Rose wasn’t any more athletic or a better scorer or passer than Russ.    As a secondary option, I’d much prefer Kyrie too.    If you count Luka and Harden as point guards, then they’re also clear choices to take.    IMO, Rose would need a very specific roster construction. In those ideal constructions, he’d be a poor man’s Wade or LeBron. Wade is bigger, stronger, scores better and more efficiently, and a better defender. Same for LeBron, but his vision and IQ are another level.    Honestly, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry would fit many rosters better than Rose. I’d obviously rather build around a talent like Rose if healthy, but Conley and Lowry are proven two-way point guards who can stay healthy (at least much more than Rose) and don’t require the ball or need a ton of spacing to be very effective."
Mavs weren't missing someone like Mike Conley
"Not sure if ""superstar"" is the right term because he is so much more and that would be underselling him, but Mike Conley missed some bubble playoff games last year for the birth of his child"
First people who come to mind would be Mike Conley or Jrue Holiday.
"The main question mark problem is Mike Conley, either his absence is helping or hurting. Clippers should have taken advantage and stole home court"
Hope mike Conley comes back and y'all complete the sweep.
"it feels so fucking good. not over yet but wow, we’ve come this far without certified clipper-killer mike conley."
Mike Conley is a career loser.
Mike Conley would put clamps on Reggie Jackson. Reggie Jackson wouldn’t even sniff 10 points if Conley was playing. Jazz in Fo.
Mike Conley is a career loser.
"mike conley is godly at finding gobert, when he comes back there will be a lot more lobs to rudy"
Mike Conley is a career loser.
When Mike Conley gets back Rudy's scoring averages should tick up. Mike's so good at feeding him in the paint.
Mike Conley is a career loser.
Clippers getting bailed tf out if he and Mike Conley are injuried for games 3 &amp; 4
Mike Conley is a career loser.
Mike Conley is a career loser.
Mike Conley is a career loser.
Mike Conley is a career loser.
Mike Conley is a career loser.
No Mike Conley and we’re up 2-0 on the Clippers
Mike Conley is a career loser.
Mike Conley is a career loser.
Mike Conley is a career loser.
"Overrated = Mike Conley, ZBo, and Marc Gasol"
Mike Conley is a career loser.
Mike Conley is a career loser.
Mike Conley is a career loser.
Mike Conley is a career loser.
Might need Mike Conley badly for Game 3
"Alright. The Jazz have earned an advantage: They can continue to rest Mike Conley if they want. Do they put Conley in to slit the Clips throat and win fast, or do they rest him and risk losing games?"
Yeah I am. Mike Conley is a career loser.
"What else could they be possibly taking away from the clippers? Lmao.  Yeah Kawhi shooting an inefficient 50, good one.  Mike Conley sucks btw"
"Mike Conley isn't even playing lmao, this series is over tbf"
JAZZ ARE TOO FUCKING CLUTCH FOR THIS SORRY ASS CLIPPERS TEAM.  JAZZ IN FO!!!  2-0 WITHOUT FUCKING MIKE CONLEY!
i 1000% forgot that mike conley is out
Mike Conley on Reggie is what we really need
Nah man you’re right. Mike Conley is more impactful for the jazz than Kawhi is for the clippers. You’re so right.
Yeah you’re right Mike Conley is more impactful to the jazz than Kawhi is to the clippers.
"Conley is responsible for more points per game than Leonard. Gobert, Royce, even Mitchell all score a lot more with Mike. Your opinion doesn’t match the stats."
"He is, not sure why that even needs to be said. But a real Kawhi game will outweigh mike Conley"
As a grizzlies fan I am legally obligated to point out that there is this guy called Mike Conley Jr.
"He’ll absolutely make a difference, but Kawhi taking a game over is worth more than a healthy mike Conley. It’s even particularly close, either."
Without Mike Conley?
I think that was actually Mike Conley.
"The jazz are doing a good job at slowing down kawhi, but it doesn’t bode well for them that the clippers have hung in both games with pedestrian performances from Kawhi  Edit: had no idea mike Conley wasn’t playing, maybe after the 5th clippers hater to point it out I’ll figure it out — thanks!"
"Could use Mike Conley in these moments, same thing happened last game"
Mike Conley is sorely missed not just as a second three level scorer but as a 1v1 defender to shut down reggie jackson
Need mike Conley simply to shut down Reggie jackson
"Mike Conley, noted kino producer"
Oof I just remembered Mike Conley is still out with the Jazz and this is happening lol
Still missing Mike Conley
WITHOUT MIKE CONLEY
Bro they have the defensive player of the year og point guard mike Conley Joe ingles the Australian shooter who just bopped Paul George and bog and Clarkson are fun to watch
Honestly I think the main factor for the series may end up being whether or not Cp3 &amp; Mike Conley are healthy.
It might be crazy but if I’m the Jazz I’m trading mike Conley and bogdanovic and whatever else is needed for Dame
"fingers crossed, i love me some mike conley. love y our jerseys too"
WITHOUT MIKE CONLEY
"Keep in mind - this is all without the Jazz' third all-star, Mike Conley."
he's a great 3pt shooter and a capable body defensively though he has his lapses. he was much worse defensively last year and stepped it a lot this year but on offense a lot of his effectiveness is mitigated in his bench minutes because most of his offense comes from corner 3s which largely gets facilitated by having both Conley and Ingles as creators on the floor. The Mike / Rudy / bench minutes are really good and that's where he spends most of his time.
Man I'm proud of these guys. Slaying without mike fucking Conley
Mike “pasta with meat sauce” Conley
Is Mike Conley likely to play in this series?
The unfortunate part about playing the Jazz is all of this shit is sustainable. If they're lucky they'll even add Mike Conley
"I don't know if Utah or Phoenix is better. Both teams are just unbelievably complete. One thing I know for sure though, I love seeing PG get cooked this early. Spida has 8 points on him in 1:40... Just disgusting. And Mike Conley isn't even playing either."
Mike Conley looks fresh as hell on the sideline. That color looks good on him
Mike Conley getting the badge in
For real. Probably why they’re so cautious right now. I know Clippers are not to be taken lightly but we have a shot at beating them without Conley. Zero chance against CP3 without Mike.
"Bruce ""Mike Conley"" Brown"
"I’m not one of those fans who thinks he would’ve gone down as a legend or anything like that, but given the chance I think he would’ve been in the prime Mike Conley, Goran Dragic tier."
"Gobert is the focal piece of the Jazz defense, so you're definitely correct there.   But I would put Royce O'Neale and Mike Conley in the great to elite category, they've both been very good defensively this season. Gobert isn't the *only* defense"
"We'll see...but honestly, both the teams were playing bad but Spida stepped up...pg13 and kawhi were shooting bad...if Mike Conley returns.. it'll be a hell of a series"
"Big O, Larry Bird, Shawn Kemp  Eric Gordon, Mike Conley, George Hill, Jeff Teague are some current players from Indiana  I'm sure there's others"
"Gordon Hayward, Cody Zeller, Mike Conley.  wished greg oden would've panned out. had to google some other ones. not many ""stars"", but Romeo langford and carsen edwards are some younger players  Edit: Forgot Eric Gordon and George Hill!"
"If the suns win a bunch of games one year (like 60+), he might get a mike Conley type of nod"
Sixers should keep him and get an actual PG to take pressure off him for having the ball in his hands so he can do what he does best which is play crazy D and run in transition.  They should shoot for Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley. Or maybe even Schroeder if they are feeling froggy.
"The biggest injury to one of Clippers' opponents was Mike Conley, who's the 3rd most important player on the Jazz, and they beat them without Kawhi in game 6."
"Bro I love Mike Conley, I voted for him to make the All Star game like 20 times. I was ecstatic when he made it, but let's not act like he got in on merit. It was basically #1 seed bonus + lifetime achievement award for never making the All Star game.   I'm so happy for him but there were better players who didn't make it (Booker, SGA, Derozan). The All Star game is just an exhibition, it's just for fun, I don't really care if guys make it who don't necessarily deserve it, people gotta stop taking it so seriously."
"Yeah I'm not sure why everyone is so confused by this in hindsight like they don't know how All Star voting works. Fucking Mike Conley was an All Star, if you're on the #1 seed you're basically a shoo-in, the 2015 Hawks had 4 representatives lmao. I thought the real oversight was putting Vuc over Trae, but it wasn't a huge snub either."
"Rajon Rondo, Lou Williams, Dennis Schroeder, Mike Conley, Patrick Beverly, Darious Garland, Devonte Graham……. Plenty of guys. The hawks have had 3 guys of these guys on our team alone"
"No they couldn't. Mitchell, Clarkson, and hobbled Mike Conley made up a Swiss cheese of perimeter defense."
Mike Conley?
LMAO bro your argument is that the Jazz weren’t 100% healthy?!?! CP3 literally had less good games than AD and averaged 9/4/8 on 44% TS before averaging 26/5/10 on 74% TS the next round after recovering. Chris Paul playing poorly negatively effects the Suns more than Mike Conley not playing. Sorry ass excuses.
"Kyle Lowry, Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Paul Millsap, Mike Conley, Steve Nash, Dennis Rodman hit his prime when he was like 50, Sam Cassell, Stockton, I'm sure there's more that's just off the top of my head. Ben is arguably better than all of those dudes were at this point in their careers. He still has upside."
"This is one of the questions that definitely need someone's career to be over to answer properly. For example many people were considering Mike Conley to be the best, up until he got called. There are many other amazing players like Eddie Johnson, Lamar Odom, Jason Terry, Jamal Crawford, Rod Strickland, Derek Harper, Cedric Maxwell, Arvydas Sabonis, Drazen Petrovic etc.   Now regarding a single season, it needs a considerable amount of research. Because all of the aforementioned had amazing seasons."
"Tore Westbrook’s meniscus in 2013 and sprained Curry’s MCL in 2016. He also choked out Mike Conley at one point and I believe booted LeBron in the groin after he came back from an injury. Those are off the top of my head.   He dives at people’s knees and swings for a lot of throats. Legitimately hate him, and not just “sports hate”."
"But who did Utah have guarding him, with Mike Conley out?"
"Wait are you serious? No Mike Conley, bum ankle Donovan Mitchell having to play his ass off every possession… are you serious?"
Mike Conley usually
"Through trades, player development, and asset management, same way as now.  Mitchell was the 13th pick and Gobert was the 27th. These aren't high lottery picks that the Jazz got for being bad, they got them through good scouting more than anything.  As for the Pacers, without a draft we probably have players like Mike Conley, Gordon Hayward, Eric Gordon, Zach Randolph, etc. not to mention historically Larry Bird, Oscar Robertson, Shawn Kemp among others all grew up in Indiana. We acquired Sabonis, Oladipo, Levert and Warren through trades and Brogdon through free agency. The draft has done nothing for the Pacers since Paul George in 2010, and before that Danny Granger in 2005, and then before that you'd have to go back to Reggie Miller in 1987."
"The draft actually hurts smaller market teams because it handicaps their ability to grow organically and allows bigger markets to just tank and pick up the best prospects, since smaller markets can't tank without hurting themselves financially.  Look at the Pacers, without a draft we could have had the likes of Gordon Hayward, Mike Conley, Eric Gordon, etc. come up, not to mention Larry Bird, Oscar Robertson, Shawn Kemp and other historical greats. Instead we have to try hard every year to be competitive and end up with Goga Bitadze, Aaron Holiday, TJ Leaf etc."
"Guess what, usually when you are hurt mid playoffs and forced to come back early nothing good happens. Look at harden, look at ad, look at mike conley, you get rusty and scared of re-injury. Kawhi's forced comeback might do them more harm than good"
Ya but he would still be rusty which can prove dangerous this far into the playoffs (small example of mike conley coming back). Hope cp3 gets a ring tho! Ayton and booker plz close this out!
What about a sign and trade of Mike Conley and the Jazz #30 pick for Ben? Conley would be a great fit in Philly with Embiid and the gang.   Jazz could get in on Ben for cheap and get a point on Mitchell’s timeline. Also a guy that would be able to switch on Kawhi/George defensively.   Terrible fit in the 4th for Utah though. But a change of scenery and the Jazz player development system with Snyder could do wonders for Ben. Especially a smaller market like Utah
Ben Simmons and Mike conley
and AD and Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley and Will Barton and a Michael Porter Jr and CP3 in round 1… who am I missing?
Mike Conley or Lowry?
Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry absolutely under no circumstance belong with the others here lol. Both are incredibly valuable and impact winning
"I thought about it, but wanted to keep the table in the OP a little cleaner. That said, here's that data:  &amp;#x200B;  |(1) Kevin Huerter|Maryland|139 pts (12 games)| |:-|:-|:-| |(2) Tim Hardaway Jr.|Michigan |119 pts (7 games)| |(T3) Bryn Forbes|Michigan State|92 pts (11 games)| |(T3) Mike Conley|Ohio State|92 pts (6 games)| |(5) Jaren Jackson Jr.|Michigan State|68 pts (5 games)| |(T6) Kendrick Nunn|Illinois|41 pts (4 games)| |(T6) Duncan Robinson|Michigan|41 pts (4 games)| |(8) Romeo Langford|Indiana|36 pts (4 games)| |(9) Alex Len|Maryland|20 pts (5 games)| |(10) E'Twaun Moore|Purdue|11 pts (3 games)| |(11) Frank Kaminsky|Wisconsin|10 pts (6 games)| |(T12) Amir Coffey|Minnesota|5 pts (7 games)| |(T12) Carsen Edwards|Purdue|5 pts (2 games)| |(14) Daniel Oturu|Minnesota|4 pts (5 games)| |(15) Jalen Smith|Maryland|3 pts (3 games)| |(T16) Yogi Ferrell|Indiana|2 pts (6 games)| |(T16) Bruno Fernando|Maryland|2 pts (2 games)| |(T16) Cassius Winston|Michigan State|2 pts (1 game)| |(T16) Xavier Tillman Sr.|Michigan State|2 pts (3 games)| |(20) Trey Burke|Michigan |1 pt (2 games)|"
But but the Jazz were missing “all-star” Mike Conley!
Bad trade for the Hornets and I’d rather bet on the slim chance Simmons becomes something better than shit tier half court offensive player he is now than just take Mike Conley for him.
Missing Mike Conley 5/6 games is a way bigger deal than missing Danny Green 5/7 games. Also the clippers before Kawhi got hurt are a way better team than the hawks.
Mike Conley and Ben Simmons are the same player. way overpaid
"Mike ""Ben Simmons"" Conley"
"That's a good point about Gobert's positioning, although when Conley is on the floor, he will position himself behind Mike at times."
&gt; There was a post a while back about the most average #1 overall pick and it concluded that an average #1 overall pick is a fringe all star. Like a Mike Conley CJ McCollum type.   Kenyon Martin
I think it’s fair to call him a bust seeing as he never even sniffed an all star team.  There was a post a while back about the most average #1 overall pick and it concluded that an average #1 overall pick is a fringe all star. Like a Mike Conley CJ McCollum type.   So I would classify Wiggins as a bust because of the expectations for his draft position.
"Probably Ben Simmons to maximise Embiid's healthy years.  He isn't as bad as the sub is going to pretend he is for the off-season, but he probably needs to have a primary point guard along side him to maximise his potential right now (or develop an offense) someone like Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley."
I'll give Mike Conley for him.
"???? But he is. Too bad donovan mitchell and mike conley were a turnstile on defense. The Clippers got penetration every posession, then when Gobert has to slide down they have a wide open 3 every time."
I’ll take him in Utah in exchange for the corpse of mike Conley
I had a 5’7” white kid named Mike Conley in my grade and I might pick him too
Yeah Mike Conley being out was a bummer.
"This comment feels eerily familiar to Utah's comments after Game 1. ""People are talking about how the Clippers could've won this and about so they're good and they don't mention that Mike Conley is coming back."""
Sounds just like the Jazz thread after game one. nO MiKE cOnLEy. nO CP3. Just wait til Ty Lue makes his legendary adjustments. Booker has the game of his life and ya'll still almost lose. Shit's not looking good for these frauds.
CP3 is way better than Conley. And I love Mike Conley and changes the game when he's on the floor
"In all of the NBA 2K games I would always start an association and make sure Bruno Fernando was my franchise player. I would always put him as starting PF and change his number to #1 so he got a confidence boost for thinking he was the number one. Everyone else in the world takes him for granted and calls him overhyped, lazy, and fat, but I appreciate what he brings to my teams. I'd like to think the real Bruno Fernando sits in his hotel room at night, during his usual NBA travels from city to city, and looks out his window across the cityscape and into the dark night and bright moon and knows how I truly feel about him. He sheds a single tear and looks down and whispers ""Thanks brandon"". Every player has an entourage or group of friends and guys that follow them around but if you Google ""bruno fernando entourage"" you just get a bunch of pictures of him alone. Even one pic of him sitting in a hoodie holding a jar of mayonnaise like some sad joke. If you Google ""Bruno Fernando girlfriend"" you get a suggestion to search for Mike Conley instead, just because they kinda look the same. Even though he's mostly a bench and roleplayer, I still want to tweet to him ""good effort!"" after every game to build him up. My heart bleeds for Bruno Fernando."
They have Cam Payne though.  Jazz didn't really have a similar replacement for Mike Conley.
"Why downvote? Luck always comes in. They were struggling against the Memphis Grizzlies with a hampered Mike Conley just returning from injury, down 2-1 in 2015"
"Yeah, Gobert definitely didn't play up to his standards in game 6, but he's also getting shit on relentlessly for having to do too much in a defensive scheme that relies much too heavily on him. When your best perimeter/wing defenders are 6'/6'1"", almost 34 year old Mike Conley with a bad hamstring and an undersized Royce O'Neal at 6'3""/6'4""..."
"He played really well in this series, big props to him.  That said, fuck that dude, dirty as hell and a total asshole. Made Goran Dragic look like Mike Conley out there."
"The Jazz would be the favorites to win the title if Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, and Karl Malone were 100% healthy and had also time traveled into versions of their bodies and minds that were at their 100% peak conditions"
Mike Conley is a far better offensive player and doesn't choke this hard in the playoffs (remember Conley going shot for shot with Kawhi in the 2017 playoffs).
"He is the classic, “was so underrated for so long that he became overrated” player. The Mike Conley special."
This. Kawhi missing two games is talked about a lot. Conley missing five (half a leg in game 6) is skipped over by nearly everyone. Mike Conley is underrated when he plays and his absence is underrated too
Which is why Mike Conley missing five games then playing game 6 on half a leg was such a big factor. The Conley Gobert PnR was a major offensive weapon. In all the threads Conley being out is being skipped over because it doesn't suit people's narrative
"Idk man. To me, his shot selection and constant hero balling in the 2nd half was what made the Jazz offense stagnant. He had Clarkson on the floor who is a rhythm player but he got cold because he wasn't able to touch the ball that much. He had good shooters in Ingles and Bogdanovic. The ball needed to be in Mike Conley (ok, he wasn't 100% so he was quite terrible, but still) or Ingles' hands, or at least make Clarkson bring the ball up the floor so he can get to his rhythm. He was trying to do way too much and ended up hurting his team instead imo. He got away from what was working for them in the 1st half."
I will fight anybody who blames Mike Conley for their loss
"Very smart comment -- this is why the Jazz spent money on Mike Conley, and I'm going to regard that as a failure, he's not really lifting any of the scoring load of Mitchell and he was just not able to guard anyone either last night."
"Conley is always injured, and playing a Conley/Mitchell backcourt is playing 2 undersized guys. Not good for defense in the playoffs. But yes if you could guarantee a healthy Conley or a young Mike Conley type of player, I would trade Simmons for him alone"
"for sure, no mike ""clipper killer"" conley + banged-up spida definitely made a difference"
"good thing mike conley is rested, good thing that meant mitchell has to do literally everything off an ankle injury and reinsure himself and continue to play on it hell ya"
Did Mike Conley come back?
It's important to mention that Mike Conley only played 1 game in this series.
"I didn't say anything about then, I said right now.  We lost this series because the clippers were willing to adjust their lineups and go all-in to exploit our biggest weakness, and we were willing to... double down on a losing strategy. And I do believe a healthy Mike Conley at least changes what this series looks like, because he's our only real play maker that can help us take advantage against a small ball lineup and get Rudy rolling offensively. But that would have been our only hope because god knows Quin wasn't going to try anything else.  But my main point still stands - if you're trying to say that Jazz fans are going to excuse away this series on a Conley injury, you haven't been talking to many Jazz fans."
"""You guys only won because Mike Conley wasn't playing"""
Bruh they lost in 6 without kwahi playing the last 2… stop acting like mike conley is actually good…
"The building was on fire and he should’ve immediately benched Gobert. Any small ball lineup would’ve been better.  I’m not a coach, but in my opinion I let Clarkson and Ingles play more down the stretch in place of Mike Conley as well. Run a few more sets with those two to be less predictable and see what happens. Also I need clarkson to create and get to the basket, try to replicate that second quarter performance he had."
"They got outcoached by Ty Lue. Quinn is good but they got buttfucked in two second halves after Clipper adjustments and didn’t have an answer. Gobert got wrecked when he had to start defending the 3pt line.  Mike Conley being out hurt as well. And maybe we are overrating Jingles, but the Jazz are good.  I don’t think the analysts are too far off to say Gobert isn’t worthy of supermax and Mitchell is a superstar. Mitchell played his ass off and Gobert was left hanging by the coaching staff in this series."
"I'm pretty sure if Mike Conley had been healthy, he could've done the same setting up Rudy when they blitzed Donovan. But Ayton can post up efficently enough which is the major difference between the two. Can Ayton pass out effectively when doubled is the only question (and i think he can)."
"Mike Conley was back like James Harden was back though. Clearly not theirself, I was rooting for the Jazz in this series. Respect to the Clippers!"
"&gt; But did he hurt his team by returning instead of help?  Yes  &gt; Mike Conley is a positive, but injured Mike is minus 8.  Relative to his team, this wasn't that bad   Most of this lies in coaching in my opinion. Unless you see some contribution from him probably best to sub him out in a do or die game."
They sat Mitchell for too long and he got tight. Mike Conley should've never suited up
"Yeah he played his heart out. No Mike Conley was a big loss this series too, and then he gutted it out tonight less than 100% and had a bad 2nd half after playing well in the 1st. This game is cruel."
NO.  Don Mitchell and Mike Conley are playing injured. How else do you explain them shooting 71% in the second half? Conley and Mitchell couldn't stay in front of anyone and that was ballgame.
"Ah I disagree. Mitchell has stepped up majorly in playmaking this past year, especially when he was put at PG with Mike Conley out"
You think mfing Serge Ibaka is a bigger difference maker than Mike Conley?
"Sorry Monk… can’t believe Flippers won.    (1) Rudy needs to learn better defense, hesitates closing the 3   (2) Mike Conley looked healthy but was rusty so Jazz should’ve had him come back game 2 or 3 to help Mitchell   (3) as good as Jazz are from 3, you guys settle for horrid contested 3s. Insane that you guys get a lead and settle for horrible shots. Need to learn to eat from the paint by feeding Rudy when you have the lead. It eats up the clock and you help maintain your lead."
“Jazz beat Clippers 2-0 without Mike Conley”  *Proceeds to blow a 20 point lead with Conley in and Kawhi out
"No Kawhi, down 20 points, Mike Conley came back, Clarkson, Donovan shooting 3s BUT THIS CLIPPERS TEAM WON THIS AND EVERY FUCKING PLAYER I REPEAT EVERY PLAYER TURNED THE FUCK UP AND TERRANCE MAAN 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌"
Run it back. Probably move off Mike Conley since he's a FA. Not playing small ball hurt them in the series for sure but there's a reason this team was the first seed. Bright future for these guys imo.
6 turnover for mike Conley in 25 minutes was rough too.
mike conley missed the whole series! donovan was playing through an injury the whole time and had to carry them!

Mike Conley robbed the Jazz and disappeared in the biggest game in this tenure there
Mike Conley should’ve stayed injured
"I feel so bad for Mike Conley. 33 years old, injured for the entire series when this season could've been his best shot at a finals berth. Then he plays and he plays like shit and his team blew a 25 point lead. Gotta feel for the man"
Mike Conley dribbbbbbleee dribble dribbbble dribbble dribbbble dribble
Feel bad for Mike Conley man
Mike Conley that would have been short on a nerf hoop
Mike Conley getting hot behind the 3 line
Mike Conley is so fucking overrated: dribble dribble dribble dribble dribble dribble pass out with 5 seconds left in the shot clock
Fuck everyone on the Jazz not named Mike Conley
Mike Conley has been garbage
Mike Conley has zero burst
Get Mike Conley out of the game
Mike Conley is a difference maker though.
"As if everyone ""clowning the clippers"" weren't clowning the Jazz for not having Mike Conley and Don - at less than 100%? - both all stars? Lmao typical."
Mike Conley had nothing to do with that
Mike Conley has risen. Everyone forgets so quickly. Defensive rating on switches is an uno reverse card now. Just need to execute. Everyone ready?
"Man, this Mike Conley guy is pretty good"
"Yeah. The Kings wouldn't let go of Fox that easy. If the Sixers could at least lock down Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley in free agency/a sign-and-trade, they wouldn't need to definitely trade Simmons for a point guard/playmaker and have a lot more options."
Mike Conley wasn't All NBA First Team. Marc Gasol was. Kyrie and Love weren't All NBA First Team. LeBron was.
"Mike Conley was injured with a facial fracture, who I'm pretty sure isn't a role player.   Kyrie and Love were injured. This is all public information, Warriors fans are insufferable."
"History would say otherwise. Tony Allen is literally their best free agent ever and they were really good for a while.   Mike Conley tells a story about his first day in the Jazz practice facility. He said he had no idea other teams had it that nice. The Jazz are hardly a big money franchise.   The NBA needs a cap similar to the NFL. It's disgusting the advantage certain teams have, it's not a level playing field."
Mf tried to eliminate Mike Conley in the Royal Rumble
***This*** is the type of content you're here for? Lazy predictions about who won't be an all star? Then you're gonna *love* this:  * James Wiseman will never be an all star  * Mikal Bridges will never be an star  * Miles Bridges will never be an all star  * Evan Mobley will never be an all star  * Mike Conley will never be a two time all star  Enjoy! I have hundreds more
"Yep, and it's not like the Clippers played fully healthy teams to get to the WCF either, playing against a Mavs team where Luka had a neck strain that didn't allow him to turn his head and a Jazz team missing Mike Conley and that featured a badly hobbled Donovan Mitchell. But obviously both the Suns and Clippers have had their own absence and injury issues, with CP3 having the shoulder injury in the 1st round then Covid in the WCF, along with Payne's ankle injury; and with Kawhi's ACL injury, Zubac with the MCL injury and Ibaka with season-ending back surgery.  The reality is that it's been an injury-littered landscape for everyone in these playoffs. Nobody's been 100% at full strength, and they haven't been fully healthy themselves. It's a totally anomalous playoffs, but the Suns have navigated these bizarre circumstances better than anyone else so far. If they win it all they'll have deserved it."
Donovan Mitchell was 80% of himself and Mike Conley didn't play for 5 games. Not to mention Luka had one of the best first round performances of all time and the Mavs role players were literally shooting better from 3 than prime Steph Curry in their wins.
"Just off the top of my head he has tried to injure / attacked: Tony Parker, Lebron, mike Conley, Westbrook, Donovan Mitchell and now Chris Paul.  I’m sure I’m missing many more.  The dirty stuff is not minimal at all."
This was before the Mike Conley trade right? Why would they take Trae
Mike Conley
i’ve always looked at mike conley as a worse kyle lowry
"Completely ridiculous. They lost to the Clippers in 6 who were a top championship contender with Kawhi, and still great even without him. They also lost Mike Conley, who was an All-Star. That’s a pretty massive hit for the team to take when trying to take down a team as good as the Clippers with Leonard. Saying they got exposed when they lost to a top team without one of their All-Stars is just dumb."
"That's silly, your comment implies that literally ANYTHING can happen in the NBA, i.e a superstar of a contending team literally dying, but it wouldn't have an asterisk.  6 of the 15 All-NBA players have been injured in this postseason, four of them either missed significant time or were ruled out of the postseason entirely and in those six, Anthony Davis, Mike Conley and James Harden are not included.  All of the Top 8 teams have had one of their top 3 players miss significant time (assuming Trae and Giannis miss more games), the winning team will win because all their opponents got injured. There's a significant chance we get an NBA Finals between Phoenix and Milwaukee/Atlanta where the Eastern Conference champion won't have their BEST PLAYER on the floor.  One injury here and there happens, but every single team that made the second round? 40% of the All-NBA teams? Stop it."
"Warriors in 2015  1st round: vs. Pelicans, injured Jrue Holiday  Semi-finals: vs. Grizzlies, injured Mike Conley &amp; Tony Allen   Conf. Finals: vs. Rockets, injured Beverly &amp; Howard  Finals: vs. Cavaliers, injured Kyrie &amp; KLove  and in those same playoffs; they avoided Spurs- defending champs, Clippers- prime lob city, AND Thunder- KD/Russ, ALL powerhouses of the conference, didn’t even play them. Look at the teams they beat: Pelicans, Grizzlies and Rockets 😭 all injured (then a cavs team with Dellavdova as the 2nd best players in the finals.)"
"I dont know about easily. The nuggets didnt have jamal murray, utah had mike conley out, even the lakers had a hobbled lebron and no AD.   Do i think fully healthy the clippers were the best team? Probably. But easily wouldn’t be the word id use for the western conference."
"My go to on this is always Mike Conley. Normal height, $200M in career earnings, probably doesn't get recognized in public a ton."
Seemed to me like there is still a lot of love for Mike Conley in Memphis.
Mike Conley and Marc Gasol in Memphis. They will never get booed here. Gave us lots of good memories
and jamal murray  and mike conley  and lebron
the jazz werewithout mike conley
"Mike Conley doesn't have an off hand, I swear"
Jrue &amp; Mike Conley are probably the best at this.
"This. And players who just got traded. Everyone on Utah shat on Mike Conley after he hadnt been playing well in the first half of his first season in Utah, but the guy was adjusting after spending his entire career in Memphis in a different playing scheme. Some of these things just take time and patience to learn and grow in, but no one cares or gives any room for error"
&gt;  Fizdale was trying to throw away the old style of Memphis and Gasol was trying to keep it.   That's not quite what happened. Gasol was quite happy to incorporate Fizdale's style into his own game. He had taken 66 3s prior to being coached by Fizdale and took 268 Fizdale's first year. Marc's best passing and scoring year was the first year under Fizdale.   Then the second year Fizdale pushed Zbo and Tony Allen out and replaced them in the rotation with a bunch of 3 and no D scrubs like Ben McLemore and Jarell Martin or Fizdale's buddy Mario Chalmers.  Mike Conley goes down and suddenly the team is reliant on Marc and a bunch of scrubs plus a bunch of passable roleplayers like Tyreke Evans and Jamychal Green.
"not sure what series you are talking about with Mike Conley, he didn't come back and play till game 5.  in the series against the clippers not to mention donovan was in no way shape or form 100% and still was able to score 30 points a night.   the Jazz would have made it to the next round if Conley was healthy and Donovan 100%. but whatever season is over for the jazz its only wishes and what ifs"
"Conley, AD, CP3, Kyrie and Embiid ALWAYS get injured. Always.   Kawhi? You never know whether he’s actually hurt or just taking time off - but he has only played 70 games twice in his career. 2/10   LeBron is 36 - has played an ungodly number of minutes - and time is catching up with him. Just as it did two years ago when he missed almost 30 games.   Luka played 66/72 games this year. Just 61/75 last year. And 72/82 the year before. Another whiff.   There is an argument to be made but this ain’t it. Not like Giannis’ injury was due to attrition. That shit could happen to anyone at anytime.   Imagine using Mike Conley as an example lmao. Foh with that nonsense"
Gonna cheat and say Utah. I think there is a good chance they beat both the Clips and Suns if you replaced injured Mike Conley with healthy Kyle.
Luka had neck issues. Mike Conley was out for a good portion. Cp3 had his left shoulder all messed up. Donovan Mitchell was out for one game and had lingering issues. Could count Jaylen brown before the playoffs as well. Klay been out the whole season.
"This is some bullshit news for the Giannis + Holiday + Middleton core  generally you have like, at best, a 5-6 year window where you can do anything as a contender due to a fuckton of factors but there are exceptions.  When it comes to the last decades champions  Warriors 2014-2019 (Trio + Durant)  Cavs 2014-2018  Heat 2011-2014  Thunder 2010-2016  **Spurs 2011-2018** Split into two eras  Spurs 2011-2014 Vestiges of the original championship trio  Spurs 2015-2018 (All star duo of Kawhi and Aldridge)  LeBron + AD duo has 2 years so far and they've had 3 of LeBron who had a nice 20-14 record before his first Laker year injury  When it comes to non champions but playoff threats (except the Raptors)  Houston 2013-2018 (Harden made the jump from all nba 3rd team to 1st team giving Houston a top 10 player)  Clippers had Chris Paul for 6 years  The Mavericks are morons who broke the core  The Grizzlies quartet of Zach Randolph, Tony Allen, Mike Conley, and Marc Gasol lasted 7 years but they only had an all star level duo for 6 of those years  The Derrick Rose bulls only had 3 all star caliber seasons from him  The Indiana Pacers had 2 all star seasons of Paul George + the Granger, Hibbert, Stephenson core before everything went to shit  The Brooklyn Nets gamble of Garnett, Pierce, + Williams lasted like a year before Pierce was gone (I know I'm stretching here)  The original all star Raptos duo of DeMar + Lowry lasted 2013-2018 before they won a massive gamble trade  The Celtics are pretty weird tbh  The Sixers are at 3 years so far of their all star duo"
"Jrue Holiday got injured in January ffs His team made the playoffs without him that's no excuse at all.   Mike Conley missed game one. They had him when they were up 2-1. Games 4,5,6 he averaged 11 points on less than 40% TS.  Dwight Howard played 35 mpg and played ever game in that series."
Anthony Davis  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kawhi Leonard  Donovan Mitchell  Joel Embiid  Mike Conley  Jaylen Brown  Chris Paul  ---  No Trae or Jamal Murray
They played us without our best defender and Mike Conley.
"We were missing our backbone on defense, Tony allan and Mike Conley. That’s a big deal."
"There are a number of acceptable UFA PGs right now, but LeBron will need to put the sales pitch on.  He could go all Tom Brady and convince CP3 or Mike Conley to play for cheap.  There really is a non-zero chance of that happening.  He can convince Reggie Jackson to leave the Clippers and get a ring.  Patty Mills and Dinwiddie are FAs.  If this wasn't LA and LeBron wasn't on the team, Schroder would have a ton of leverage.  But it is LA and LeBron is on the team for the next 2 years."
A couple years removed but Mike Conley and Marc Gasol both played on the grizzlies together from gasol’s first NBA season in 2008 until he was traded to the Raptors in early 2019. Whole decade together
List of point guards who are 100% better than Reggie Jackson (in no particular order):  1. Curry 2. Lillard 3. Kyrie 4. Cp3 5. Trae Young 6. SGA 7. Jamal Murray 8. De'Aaron Fox 9. Jrue Holiday 10. Mike Conley  11. Westbrook 12. Lowry 13. Kemba 14. Brogdon 15. Ja Morant  and that's not even including big guys that technically play PG like  1. LeBron 2. Luka 3. LaMelo 4. Simmons
Oden belongs in the list as well. Dude was a crazy prospect and led Ohio State to the National Championship with Mike Conley. Then... Portland drafted him
"No Serge Ibaka (Season ending back surgery)  Joe Ingles finishing 2nd beside (Jordan Clarkson) for 6th man of the year.  List can go on and on.  &amp;#x200B;  Jazz has accomplish nothing in their franchise history but my word do you guys talk so much shit just cause you got the 1st seed this season.  (To be fair the Clippers haven't done shit since it's entire existence as well)  But to go out and say I'm a Ignorant rebranded Lakers fan, when you can't even look at the other side of the argument and just go with  ""Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley is injured reason why we lost"" ""You're ignorant AF""  Get out of here with that weak petty shit.  &amp;#x200B;  Jazz fan have the same mentality as their roster.  They just give up and fold and just look for the easiest excuse."
"Zach Randolph, Tony Allen, Mike Conley, Marc Gasol, Beno Udrih, Quincy Pondexter, Lorenzen Wright, Bonzi Wells, and Memphis."
Mike Conley and Memphis. Giannis and Milwaukee. Derozan and Toronto. Russ and OKC.
"Mike Conley is above average at best. Great leader and teammate, but I see nothing special about him outside of those traits which many others have. On the court, I see someone who is good starting point guard, not a multi-time All-Star snub. I’ve been downvoted ferociously for stating this in the past but dammit it’s a hill I’m dying on."
"Agreed. Trae young does all of those things you mentioned, and I find it so ironic that ever since he’s been in the league there were all of these concerns about his length and being a defensive liability. Bottom line is, the PG role is offense first. Guys like Mike Conley are valuable, since he’s a legit two way player. He does all of the things you mentioned, and is a top tier defensive guard which is what sets him apart from other PGs. But currently Ben Simmons is really just a one way player, at least in the playoffs."
"What Pat did in the end is exactly why he didn’t get the benefit of the doubt on the foul. Had he been a mike Conley type (who s never received a tech that sticked), he would’ve gotten away with just a normal foul."
"Bro I know you think I'm fucking stupid but let's not act like Conley's been pouting on the bench about being stuck in Utah. I would have totally agreed with Windhorst if it was someone like Trevor Ariza or Andre Igouadala, but Mike Conley has never said anything publicly bad about Utah and he denied the statement by Windhorst directly."
We'd expect it to go better if Mike Conley is healthy. Which to be fair is a big if.
The same stage I was in when Brian Windhorst claimed that Mike Conley didn't want to go to Utah
"But saying that coming back is a factor is nuts. They dug themselves a hole first. It would have been more impressive to just win those games.   Regardless, Dirk played otherworldly/GOAT talent with Jason Terry as his number 2 to win that chip. This Clippers run wouldn't even compare. Beating Luka by himself, Jazz with Mike Conley out for most of the series and a hobbled Donovan Mitchell, and this Suns squad just doesn't compare to Dirk's run."
"It’s been fun I’m just saying it would be cool to see these playoffs with everyone healthy.  Specifically: Kawhi, AD, Harden, Jamal Murray, Kyrie, Joel, Donavan, Mike Conley, and Jaylen Brown.  You’re taking this too seriously lol. It’s not that deep my man"
"As if literally every championship win doesn't have some luck lol. Hawks got injured Joel and scared Simmons, Bucks got injury luck, Utah was missing Mike Conley vs clips. That's the game."
"Mike Conley, Donovan Mitchell"
"The Suns are better than the Jazz, especially with a hobbled Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley."
"Mike Conley (in his prime) was one of the most underrated point guards in the league. He really should have been an all star before 2021, which even then, it was by default :("
Gobert can’t 1v5 lol the Jazz’s second line of defense was Royce o Neale and an injured Mike Conley
"Mike Conley was the highest paid player in the league, hardly unrecognised."
Also the whole “no all-star” comment as if DeMar didn’t exist this season &amp; only missed out on a selection for the Mike Conley participation award.
I would've said Mike Conley until this year. Guys been great but he did win an all defensive team in 2o13.   Gallanri and Conley have the unfortunate fate of playing the same position as some alltime greats during their careers.
"For comparison, here's the list of key players who missed  games in the 2015 playoffs due to injury. (I chose this year at random, but it may have been an outlier as well)  *Stars/Borderline Stars*  * John Wall * Pau Gasol * Kevin Love * Kyrie Irving * Rojon Rondo * Jrue Holiday * Chris Paul * Mike Conley  *Key Role Players:*  * Andrew Bogut * Tony Allen * Kyle Korver * JR Smith"
"Warriors / lakers/ philly   Healthy nets will be the team to beat next year unless warriors sign a decent veteran based bench next year and klay comes back strong   So the only places dame can reasonably compete next year will be either the warriors for wiseman/7+14/wiggans or lakers for schroeder/ kuzma/ tht/ kcp and whatever picks lakers can trade or trade for I think that all depends on what the warriors want to do since you'd have both dame and steph on mega maxes and they somewhat play the same role   philly trade Simmons, Maxey, thybule other 1sts ... gives you the best single piece in Simmons but I'd then turn around and trade McCollum as well and rebuild   None of these other teams make sense ... denver won't trade Jamal or mpj .. Mike Conley does nothing for Portland, zingus does nothing for Portland   Lakers offer only makes sense if dame just says trade me there"
you're probably right but this hinges on finding 3 good 3nD wings?! I think it's hard enough to find one  I do think a healthy Mike Conley goes a long way through. you really need another shot creator next to Mitchell
Stupid posts like this make me hate the Mike Conley injury that much more..ah well so it goes. You don't replace Gobert with Simmons. Jazz need a small ball OPTION not a team built around it. You need a guy that can step in for 10-15 minutes until the opposing coach says well this isn't working and tries to play big again. Where Gobert dominates and isn't put in no mans land
Re-sign Mike Conley  Draft an athletic 3 and D wing  Sign another 3 and D wing (emphasis on the D).  Sign another 3 and D wing that can play small ball center.  Sign a veteran point guard from the bargain bin.
"And the Suns won all 3 while losing 2/3 with him in. Dude, Pat Bev and 1 game of Mike Conley is not even notable. That’s like a normal amount of injuries for the average team. No team has ever faced teams with stars out every round of the playoffs like the Suns have."
"Mike Conley missed a singular game against the Warriors, and it was only game 1 my guy. Jrue Holiday played all but game 2. These injuries do not compare to Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, and Jamal Murray."
"""...Back in 2015, the Warriors were basically billed as a three-time lotto winner -- to the point that plenty of people STILL put somewhat of an asterisk by that title -- because they faced injured opponents along the way. Jrue Holiday missed the first round for New Orleans. Mike Conley missed the second round for Memphis. Most notably, LeBron's Cavaliers were without Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving (for all but Game 1) in the Finals. """
"Mike Conley, Kawhi and Kyrie/Kevin Love."
"""Warriors only beat us in 2015 cause Mike Conley was wearing a face mask 😢"""
I did get some of the series mixed up because I thought they happened the same year but here's the more notable series injuries for them.   2015 vs Grizzlies - Mike Conley and Tony Allen missed a few games each and were limited  2015 Finals vs Cavs - Kevin Love and Irving were out   2017 vs Spurs - Tony Parker and Leonard were out   2018 vs Rockets - Chris Paul went out for games 6-7   Those are all some very key games / series with key players being out
Start getting your asterisks and excuses ready. Jazz didn't have Mike Conley when you beat them. Should people be including that in the discussion of how lucky and meaningless your win was? No. You won. Injuries are part of it every year. Quit crying.
The Clippers are missing Kawhi and the best player that missed time against them was Mike Conley
"On Memphis hating Draymond.  I doubt this is actually the reason but imo the dirtiest play Draymond has ever done was in the 2015 playoffs.  Mike Conley was playing with a broken face and dove for a loose ball.  Draymond dove kind of on top of him and very intentionally elbowed Conley in the face.  I will defend Draymonds antics against OKC in 2016 as at least not being intentional, but I can't at all defend that play from 2015, it was straight dirty.   Edit:  Making this comment actually made me go rewatch the play and it wasn't as bad as I remember.  Oh well haha"
I voted Blake Griffin for the Grizz. But I get Draymond. He hit Conley in the face after breaking his face against the Blazers in the previous series.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/video-draymond-green-hits-mike-conley-in-the-injured-face-on-loose-ball/  Conley clearly calling a timeout and Draymond comes in grabbing at the ball and hits him in the face. It’s pretty bang-bang but lots of Grizz fans weren’t happy with how it went down.
2015 draymond green hit mike conley in the face in mikes first game back from a facial fracture as he wore a mask
now I know you're trolling.  Mike Conley missed games 1-5 against the Clips.  Donovan Mitchell injured his ankle at the end of game 2.
"I’d prob compare him to about Mike Conley level on the jazz. Still a star, but the team could get by without him. Obviously Manu had a better career but they’re kind of equivalent"
"Yeah but Kawhi, DeRosen, Mike Conley, Drummond, Aldridge, Ball, Markkanen, JarretAllen, are all looking to get paid. I think only 4 teams will have enough cap space to offer a max. So even if it only takes 1, it doesn’t seem likely to happen.   Knicks - could possibly make a max offer   Spurs - doubtful   OKC - definitely not tying up a max spot during their rebuild.   Dallas - with $42 million already spent on KP and Powell I don’t know if spending the max on Collins makes a lot of sense, but it’s still possible.   I just don’t see it happening but it’s certainly possible."
"Literally nobody else except for Mike James can create their own shot on the Hospital-edition Nets during the Bucks series...I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Jeff Green, or Blake Griffin dribbling the ball in their hands the way shot creators would to find their shots. The fact that KD dropped 49 and 48 while playing the entire game and being the only focus on defense for Milwaukee as well as being guarded by PJ Tucker who has been regarded as ""the KD stopper"" going back years now, yeah that's insane  At least for the Jazz, an on-and-off Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Bojan Bogdanovic, and even Joe Inglés can kinda create their own shot, the other Nets played as the beneficiaries of playmakers like Harden and him being hobbled showed consequences on the court"
"I think Ben in particular would benefit from shooting underhand. While there are a few crosshanded people in the NBA (i.e. those who shoot with their off hand) like LeBron and Mike Conley, Simmons is definitely the worst shooter of the group. I don't think switching hands is a good idea for his jumper (because it's more about his feet), I think a complete change of his FT form is a good idea and this deals with the question of right hand vs left hand for him.   I actually don't think you should take blame for misremembering Gladwell. He gets facts wrong and is less than clear in other instances. It's interesting, but it's more entertainment."
"Some of our fans are dumb as shit. To say that Mike Conley&gt;&gt;&gt;Kawhi is hilarious. Kawhi is literally the best player on your team, was having a legendary playoff performance and to say that Mike Conley is more important because he’s their main shot creator (just what is Kawhi then..?) is dumb as hell.   Utah was just exposed. Fake 1 seed. Nothing new. They have 1 true star playoff scorer and a bunch of very good role players and then Gobert, who is very limited offensively and can be schemed against easily. The combo of Mitchell+Gobert isn’t better than healthy Bron+AD, Kawhi+PG, etc."
"Thank you, I don't understand why this is being thrown around like it makes sense. He's like 130% of Seth Curry for like 300% the salary  I think a Mike Conley+1st for Ben Simmons trade makes much more sense. Someone much more distinct in his skill sets and able to control an offense, not just create off a pick and roll a bit."
"Bogi Bogdanovic is 6’6”, so the Hawks do not use two small guards.  The Clippers have a pair of elite perimeter defenders at the forward spots, which masks the defensive woes of playing undersized guards. And I’m pretty sure PG has played the 2 a fair bit in LA.  And Mike Conley plays great defense for a player of his size, plus their defense is anchored by Gobert. Utah got exposed due to their lack of perimeter defense these playoffs.  The problem with two small guards is that normally, they’re gonna be a defensive sieve. Such is the case with SexLand, which is unfortunate since they’re both good, young players."
I think the bulls can have a hawks/Miami like run in the playoffs with some luck. Aka if the nets and the bucks somehow find themselves on the same side of the bracket again.  Dark horse title team: I still believe in Utah for some reason. As a Spurs fan I think the Rudy gay signing was quite underrated. Hopefully Mike Conley stays healthy. I would say warriors but I’m not sure they qualify as a dark horse.  Dark horse playoff team: is it too easy to say pistons? Cade lives up to the hype and that’s certainly a play in team
Ypu just called me delusional when you asked in a NBA subreddit if mike conley was comparable to CP3. Its not a disagreement. It is just a dumb take.
"Self burn? Those are rare. You  are trying to compare a HOFer in CHRIS PAUL with Mike Conley?  You are seriously asking me why CHRIS PAUL deserves a place in this list when Mike conley is not on it. Let us do a full run down of accolades, shall we?  CHRIS PAUL, a.k.a CP3: 11x ALL STAR  10x All NBA (4x 1st, 5x 2nd, 1x 3rd)  7x All defensive 1st team  2x All defensive 2nd team  4x Assist Leader  6x Steals Leader  MIKE CONLEY 1x All STAR  Do you even watch basketball? Please just do us a favour and leave the damn sub."
Mike Conley last season
"Getting rid of max contracts would he the best route for the NBA from a parity standpoint but the NBPA would never agree and also it turns out superteams get ratings.  Think about this. Bron AD and Westbrook will run you about $110 million a year. Mike Conley, Tobias Harris and Kevin Love is about $100 million. Yes I intentionally chose some terrible contracts but maybe the latter 3 were actually worth that at the time of signing. But by capping salaries for the former 3 you really stifle teams that don't have one of the handful of superstars out there."
"Mike Conley just started figuring things out last season, if anything he’ll be better."
dam i had no clue cp3 = mike conley. why is cp3 getting paid so much more then?
"Not disagreeing with you hear. But that Kawhi-less Clippers took the Suns to 6. Jazz blew the 2-0 lead no doubt, but we still gotta factor in that Mike Conley was injured all that series and Mitchell wasn’t 100% as well. Full props to the Suns though, they don’t chose their own circumstances, only took advantage of what they had in front of them and the Clippers exposed the Jazz pretty badly after game 2, on top of taking the Suns to 6."
"Tell Mike Conley to stop getting hurt, for starters."
mike conley being hurt definitely affected them in the playoffs but they're kinda locked into their current roster atm
"I like this team a lot. May be because Mike Conley is my favorite player to ever exist, but…"
"2007 - 2008 Heat, Sonics, Grizzlies, T-wolves  PG: Conley, Foye, Lowry SG: Wade, Mike Miller,McCants SF: Durant, Gay PF: Pau Gasol, Hakim Warrick C: Shaq, AL Jefferson  Could include Shawn Marion at PF if allowed to use both before and after trades. Has to be a playoff team."
Kyle Lowry is not better than Mike Conley.
how the hell is Ben Simmons a tier above Mike Conley?
I definitely see the potential but is Lamelo really at this point a whole tier above somebody like Mike Conley who was literally an all star last year?
"Mike Conley is tier 4, LOL, literally laughing out loud. How you gonna disrespect the man putting him in a group with Cade, Ball, and Smart, lol."
Mike Conley is obviously in the borderline all-star tier given that he actually WAS an all star just last year
"Chandler is definitely a great story.  I'll also point out Kyle Lowry. In his 2nd year the Grizzlies drafted Mike Conley to be their PG of the future and Lowry didn't show much. He got traded to the Rockets where he was a decent starter who showed flashes, and then on the Raptors finally became an All-Star in his 9th season. From there he made 6 consecutive All-Star appearances and became the veteran leader of a title team.  Edit: Also Steve Nash is a crazy story. In his early years in PHX stuck behind Kidd, KJ, and Cassell. Didn't become a regular starter until his age-27 season, and then out of nowhere became a 2-time MVP in his early 30s."
Mike Conley was 2nd in defensive win shares at that point and if that doesn't prove my original point that defensive win shares is flawed idk what will.  Gobert was 3rd and that shows how teammates can affect defensive win shares as well as OFG% (Opponent FG%).
Its like comparing Prime Mike Conley and CJ Mccolum. Id rather have Conley.

"Wait hold on, whose made the huge moves in the West?   The Lakers yes. The Nuggets yes, they added a starter in Aaron Gordon last season. The Clippers no. The Suns re-upped. And the Jazz, no, Rudy Gay and Mike Conley don't seem like they're enough to get em over the playoff hump.  I think only two teams could say they got better, with the Suns, Grizz and Mavs probably banking on internal growth to get them to the WCF/finals. Of course, the best out of these teams is the Suns."
"There were three players over 33 who played significant roles on this years playoff teams: Mike Conley, Chris Paul, Lebron. They all had injuries in the playoffs. Goran Dragic, Carmelo, Joe Ingles, Gallinari were probably the next most significant contributors over 32 on playoff teams. Dragic had injuries late in the season. Gallinari had a playoff injury. None played over 30 minutes a game and closer to 20-25 minutes.   The list of guys 33+ who play 30+ minutes deep into the playoffs is a very short list. Lebron, Chris Paul, and Kyle Lowry 2 years ago at 33 are it really in the last few years.   The Lakers are going to have to be really smart to distribute the minutes. Teams are giving too much to some of these older guys in my opinion (not the Lakers necessarily since they’re 1 year deals mostly). We’re going to see some teams stuck on some contracts for guys who fall off the cliff."
It’s actually not a specific year - it’s at least 2024 if not later but they didn’t say you get X year’s pick.   I mean I think it’s pretty clear that if you have to move a salary you give a pick. They also just signed Rudy gay after re-signing Mike Conley. Imo it was a move to make the team better not quite Derrick favors is trash and they need to move on. Favors would have put them more in the luxury tax which they don’t want to pay.

The Jazz were desperate to re-sign Mike Conley. This is a good deal for both parties.
didnt know Chris Paul and Mike Conley were NBA champs LMAO bad take once again
"Of course he did that because he's a floor raiser, his skill set lends itself to carrying bad teams to more wins than they would otherwise get.  He's not the type of PG you get if you are trying to be a championship contender and fit around LeBron and AD, he's not Chris Paul, he's not Kyle Lowry, he's not Mike Conley."
Yo mike Conley has secured the BAG over the course of his career. Makes me happy cause he was never a flashy all star type player.
Mike Conley and Donovan Mitchell's injuries did it too.
"thats to much for lowry and i'm a raptors fan, seriosuly what are the heat smoking. Mike conley 3 years 68 was a good deal   #3  YEARS 90 FOR A 35 YEAR OLD IS NOT A GOOD DEAL"
"&gt;Free agent Mike Conley Jr. has agreed to a three-year, $68 million deal to return....  Yes...YES....   &gt;to the Utah Jazz  FUCK"

I fucking love Mike Conley
Mike Conley disagrees
Later today:  Mike Conley has agreed to a three year $90M contract...
That’s a lot for a 33 year old Mike Conley?
Mike Conley deal gets done early on. 3 years 60 million.
"No lol  New Orleans Pelicans starting PG Jrue Holiday was limited to 55 minutes total and missed one game of the Warriors' sweep entirely coming off a stress reaction in his right tibia. Memphis Grizzlies starting PG Mike Conley missed Game 1 of the series with Golden State because of a facial fracture, and starting SF Tony Allen played just five minutes over the last two games because of a sore left hamstring. The Houston Rockets played without starting PG Patrick Beverley and backup F/C Donatas Motiejunas, while starting C Dwight Howard played through a torn MCL and torn meniscus suffered during the Western Conference finals. In the NBA Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers were without starting PF Kevin Love because of shoulder surgery early in the playoffs and lost starting PG Kyrie Irving to a fractured patella late in Game 1."
"yes. Kyrie, PatBev, Mike Conley, and Jrue Holiday all had injuries."
So would Steph's first ring be seen in a better light if Jrue Holiday and Mike Conley each played 1 additional game?
"Exactly. The Clippers would have won if they'd stayed healthy and everyone else had got hurt like they did. But if everyone else was fully healthy then I don't think they'd have gone any further than they did. They may not have even gone that far, especially if Mike Conley and Donovan Mitchell had been 100% in the second round."
"That's what Mike Conley is about to get. He isn't touching that, that the ask price is always higher"

"No idea how you can say he isn’t a starter anymore. He was legitimately good pre-All Star break and if you don’t think he can play a comparable role to Kyle Lowry or Mike Conley (when healthy) I don’t know what to say to you.  He’s obviously not an All-Star, at least not last year, for sure, but that’s the meaning of fringe."
"Jimmy Butler, Mike Conley, Draymond Green even more, Kemba Walker, Russell Westbrook"
"It might be possible. But looking at the flipside... Mike Conley Sr. dunked from well beyond the FT line at 6'1""."
Holiday very quietly got traded this week. rough season last yr was banged up still think he might have a chance to be a decent rotation piece. I know Indiana at one point was very high on him J Michael said in summer 2019 Aaron Holiday was the sticking point on a potential Mike Conley trade they wouldnt include him
The problem is the evidence changes so quickly.  Do you want Kemba Walker on a contending team?  The Celtics would likely tell you no.  But we would have all said no about Chris Paul and Mike Conley at points previously too when they seemed washed up.
"The league changes so quickly.  Ben Simmons has a poisonous contract that scares most fan bases.  It’s like a 4 year contract though.  When he has a good season this year, we might all change our mind.  Kyle Lowry is so old.  He’s probably the most coveted free agent this offseason.  If he starts to have a bad season, his contract will suddenly be terrible!  Mike Conley had a terrible contract before and Chris Paul!  And now they’re highly coveted!  It makes you wonder what will happen with guys like Steven Adams, Kemba Walker, Al Horford.  The players are people and people can change, they can fully return from injury, fit in a better system, improve, etc. and we all just have to react to it and change our perception"
It took me 28 years to realize that this Mike Conley is the son of THAT Mike Conley…
"Mike conley is my shit. He is the last true PG after cp3,  he did memphis right, utah fans should be happy.  Ja is fun, whatever, but there is something unique about watching how calculated a PG like Conley or CP3 can be.  And hes left handed just to fuck you over even more"
I hope the Jazz win a title while Mike Conley is there.  Do I think the odds are strong? Of course not. But Mike Conley seems to be a really great dude. I hope he gets a ring.
That's Mike Conley money for Ball
Mike Conley is a locker room leader though.
"Couple things here. Conley had a really hard time adjusting to a new system when he got here and had one of the worse seasons of his career, so he probably doesn't want to repeat that process. He's also probably doesn't want to uproot his kids again, and Utah is also a really nice place to raise them. Lastly I get the feeling Mike has a little bit of guilt for being injured when we needed him this season (to be clear, he shouldn't, he played his ass off for us any time he was healthy) and wants to sort of redeem himself. If this is legit then I'm pretty thrilled as a Jazz fan, I was expecting an overpay at 22-25 mil a year. Very high character move from Mike, what else would you expect from Mike Conley though ? Love the guy."
The idea of Mike Conley pissed off calling his agent ready to fire him because someone other than Woj or Shams got the story first is so silly
"Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Dirk, Marc Gasol.   Sorry Zbo"
But I still don’t understand why you think Mike Conley needs to fire his agent. Why would Mike Conley care if a small beat writer gets the story before Woj or Shams
"Mike Conley is 34 and took a slight pay cut. It’s not like 20m was the most he could get anywhere.   I get that Schroeder hate is trendy but mf is gonna get 4/80 almost guaranteed. It only takes one team. Also saying you should make 25 million a year when the team you’re on evaluates you at 20 mil is something like the first page of negotiation for dummies.   I don’t get the hate, it makes y’all look like you’re either incapable of thinking for yourselves or simply ignorant  All that being said he’s an asshole but that shouldn’t cloud people’s ability to reason"
&gt;mike Conley is  currently better than Lowry  When did this become fact
Why would Mike Conley care who breaks the story?
Doubt this guy's report is right. Mike Conley is younger and currently better than Lowry and is going to get ~10 mil per year less? Doesn't make sense.   We will see in 2 days but I don't trust this source.
"Chris Paul, Mike Conley, Marc Gasol, LeBron. Love him or hate him, Bron has just always been fun to watch."
mike conley to boston is something i haven't heard of but i am more than welcome to have that happen
There’s replacements all the time. Nobody thought Mike Conley could get into the all star game at the beginning of last year. All I’m saying is I wouldn’t be shocked at all to see Russ make it.
Jazz need to clear money to re-sign Mike Conley. By clearing 10m a year they can pay Mike around 25m a year

Me too.. I like Suggs but I see him more like a Mike Conley. Very good on and off the court but not a star guard.
"Collins is a Utah kid and the Jazz are actually winning, so I imagine if he does consider other suitors, Utah would be somewhere he'd much prefer to San Antonio or something. But don't the Jazz also need to make a decision on Mike Conley? And Donovan Mitchell's max contract kicks in next season? John Collins is gonna demand $25m/yr minimum."
Mike Conley come back please
That’s enough for Mike Conley
"I'm from the usa, but I have no idea who David duke is.  Buy it doesnt sound good so far....  if anyone cares to shed more light on him and his relevancy. I'd be entertained.  But if not.

"No one said it did, they're saying that at the very least he doesn't appear to be a bad person  We don't know the guy so we can't say for certain he's a good or bad person, and this applies for literally every single person in the NBA, even people we've never heard anything bad about like Mike Conley."

"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
Mike Conley when he eats too much sweets
I think Suggs can be a Jrue Holiday/Mike Conley hybrid if he hits his peak
"Your proof for how exploitable Rudy is was the Clippers series.  How did the Clippers win? By running that play over and over. (You'd know this if you'd ever watched any Jazz games).  If you concede that no one else in the league could have properly done what the scheme asked of Rudy there, then you no longer have a point.  So I'll make this explicit: do you think Turner would have been able to both help on Jackson's drive *and* challenge Mann's shot without overcommitting and allowing an entry pass back inside, where the only interior defender was Mike Conley?"
"It certainly ruined the ability to casually discuss players. Some players that have great advanced stats kinda suck and some players that have poor advanced stats are way better than the stats indicate.   My buddy was trying to say Mike Conley is better than Westbrook. I don't care what the numbers say, give me Westbrook in the majority of situations."
"Ok and that doesn't change what I said. Players are rewarded for being on good teams. I mean Mike Conley made the all star team averaging 16/6 over guys like Fox (25/7), Ingram (24/5), and DeRozan (22/7)"
A customer I was taking care of a week or two ago said I look like mike conley.
"To be fair while it’s semantics, if not for the legacy vote sense should’ve been an all star over mike Conley this year.   Demar is still better when they got him than kuz will ever be"
Oh yeah if you gave them Mike Conley that team would be elite.
Hmm wonder if an injured Mike Conley and a spread thin Donovan had anything to do with that.
I would probably replace Bogie with either Mike Conley or Joe Ingles.
"Its a failure on a team level, no one is without fault in that series vs the Clippers  The Jazz basically put Rudy Gobert in the worst possible situation, they were without Mike Conley and no one else looked particularly competent at getting *something* out of Gobert on offense. Clippers could afford to go small since they realized Gobert can't create for himself at all even against the smaller Batum/Morris  Then defensively, his team mates basically hung him out to dry. It was ridiculously easy for the Clippers to beat their man on the perimeter, forcing Gobert to slide over as the help defender which leaves gaps in the defense. The Clippers then pinged the ball around quickly until they found an open shooter from deep."
"I think another thing is that even when they did attempt to pass to Gobert, the pass was either mistimed or hung in the air too long to where Batum would smack it immediately. They greatly missed Mike Conley on the offensive end."
"This benefits Portland, Philly can get a better deal than CJ McCollum. Portland would have to offer much more for Simmons than just CJ.   And you keep saying all star in the east. He didnt even beat out Mike Conley as a reserve in the west. How is he going to beat out Harden, Kyrie, Butler, Beal, Westbrook,  Lavine, Trae Young, and I'll stop at Jrue Holiday. And those are just the guards in the east bro. 8 that you can put before CJ. That doesn't even include Simmons who is better than CJ and is listed as a Guard/Forward."
"I definitely think he has some issues, but I also think doc was not designing a scheme that did him any favors. I don’t think he’s at all like Gobert tho, gobert has problems on the perimeter defensively and couldn’t produce offensively without mike Conley. Simmons could function in a better offense imo but defensively he will never be a liability."
"No cap room in Utah, unless Conley doesn't re-sign.  But he'd do pretty well as a backup plan for Mike."

Steph Cp3 Harden  Lillard  Kyrie   Lowry is closer to Mike Conley than he is to these guys.
"Yeah I’m a Warriors fan too, but I’m happy him and Jrue won they earned it. I just hope Mike Conley, Melo or D Rose can win a ring as well"
"I mean he’s 31 and always loses, other guys like that get called losers.  For some reason when it comes to Dame it’s always someone else’s fault.  Congrats on comparing an alleged superstar to Mike Conley tho!"
"He absolutely is good enough, the team around him is not.   Put him on the Phoenix Suns in place of either CP3/Book, and you think they wouldn't be able to compete for a championship/win it all?   Put him on the Utah Jazz in place of Mike Conley, you don't think they wouldn't be able to win it all?   Put him on the Philadelphia 76ers in place of ""I'm too scared to dunk the basketball since I might be fouled"", and you don't think they would be able to win it all?"
Doterra is a bottom-feeding pyramid scheme. Mike Conley can definitely do better!!
Mike Conley in an MLM is not something I really expected
"Yup. If kyrie's actual on-court impact matched the aesthetics of his game, he'd be the unquestionable GOAT. OTOH, if the beauty of his game dropped to match his production, he'd come up in these ""who is better"" conversations about as often as Mike Conley"
"Literally competing against Harden, Westbrook, Steph, Dame, CP, Kobe, and Klay in any given year he was in New Orleans. No wonder it took Mike Conley so long, and Jrue got like no chance against any of these other guys"
"You may not forget though, that the Jazz lost Mike Conley right before the Clippers series.  Would have ended differently with him on the roster and Kawhi out."
I met Mike Conley once and he’s literally one of the nicest people I’ve ever met in my life. We talked for a solid 10 minutes and he couldn’t have been more pleasant.
Mike Conley had a higher % on pull up 3’s then Mitchell
I played roulette with Richard Hamilton in the Bahamas..super nice guy. Met Mike Conley too..super fkn nice guy
"I think Jerry West is an amazing executive, but I've seen people try to pad out his resume by talking about how great he made the Grizzlies, but that was really Chris Wallace. Under West they made the playoffs three straight years and were swept all three times. In his last year there they won only 22 games.   He left and Wallace put together a rebuild which literally everyone laughed at while he was doing it, but which produced some incredible teams. He's the one that got Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph and locked up Mike Conley on an extension which everyone thought was an absurd overpay but which turned out to be a steal. Wallace was a punching bag for Bill Simmons for many years, but he deserves credit for what he built there."
Mike Conley sr won in the triple jump so you could say he was eurostepping before it was cool.   And yes go watch the highlights of him dunking.   He was also jr and Greg odens agent when they left college.
"he was on the same aau team as greg oden, mike conley, and josh mcroberts"
Mike Conley Sr was an Olympic athlete and still dunks better than his son.  Who barely dunks at all but is an NBA player
Mike Conley Sr casually dunked from the free throw line at like 6' tall
Mike Conley Pops a 2x Gold medal track star    Jrue Holiday wife 2x golds in soccer &amp; fiba silver
"I mean, neither Middleton or Holiday made it did they? Making the All-Star team is hard, you pretty much have to be an elite offensive player or Gobert/Simmons level on defense. I don't see Hunter or Barrett as likely to clear either of those bars. Depending on how many injuries/opt-outs there are, they could make it a la Mike Conley, but I don't see them making a team outright, at least not in the next couple years."
"Mike Conley will be up there imo. Borderline all star level for a long time, just at probably the most talent rich position and not flashy whatsoever."
"KD actually wasn't the biggest free agent in 2016 as LeBron was also a free agent that summer, but after winning that championship in Cleveland just weeks earlier of course nobody thought he was going anywhere else. Other notable free agents that summer that signed max (or close to it) contracts were Al Horford, DeMar DeRozan, Bradley Beal, Mike Conley, Nicolas Batum, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard and Hassan Whiteside. That was also the infamous summer where role players got wildly overpaid. Guys like Biyombo, Mozgov, Mahinimi, Deng, Parsons, etc. [Here's a list from that summer.](https://www.businessinsider.com/31-best-nba-free-agents-2016-2016-6)"
Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are a bit better than Josh Okogie and Jarrett Culver I think
Mike Conley
"That's Mike Conley Jr.'s dad, who was a gold-medal winning triple jumper. Also competed in long jump.  Videos like this and of random football players throwing down sick dunks makes me wonder what other sports have athletes with crazy hops. Definitely a lot of track and field dudes."
I think Lamelo Ball will make a first time all star appearance next year.   I think Mike Conley won't make it next year.
he's no mike conley but that was a sweet dunk
Didn't Jesus also go off with violence that one time at the temple? Is Mike Conley classier than Jesus?
"Vucci mane, Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, Randle maybe?"
Mike Conley has never received a technical foul in his nba career
"If thats the case then the only contenders in this dicsussion should be guys who never received a tech, like Mike Conley. Or maybe grant candidates 1 mulligan."
"&gt;If Kawhi Leonard doesn’t bounce in a shot at the buzzer vs. Philly in 2019  They would have went to overtime. I don't know, it's an iconic play but it bugs me that this shot always seems to get included in these butterfly effect moments. If he misses the series gets reset back to a 50/50 proposition. That 50% win probability is big but the teams fates didn't end up swinging *wholly* on that shot like they did for Ray Allen, Durant, or even the Mike Conley shot that rimmed out against the Nuggets."
Mike Conley is in the discussion.
"That is definitely a false comparison. Yes it’s true that on paper demar looks like an all star and Russ looks like an MVP. But in practice, Russ is not an MVP. When you watch him, you can see that there are clearly better players in the league. But when you watch demar you can clearly see that you’re watching an all star caliber player.  Another difference I could point out is that the current MVP is an objectively better player than Russ. Whereas there are at least a few all star selections who demar has a strong case for being better than. Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons, Sabonis and Mike Conley are a few examples."
"Which is a system that works if you have say, Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley with rotating in Jordan Clarkson and Joe Ingles in the mix, but not with Bledsoe and Lonzo"
"I mean, you’re not wrong, but who would you rather be missing? Mike Conley, or Kawhi Leonard, who prior to getting hurt, was looking like the MVP of the whole playoffs?"
"Mike Conley aint a real all star, he got the Dirk/Wade sympathy selection"
"I have a hard time taking seriously any poll that is willing to *already* put LaMelo ahead of All-Star Mike Conley. He hasn't even proven shit yet, whereas Mike is a highly accomplished guard in the league. No sir, this aint it."

"They had the 2nd Best Defensive Rating with DPOY and All-Star Marc Gasol, All-Star Zach Randolph and All-NBA Defense Mike Conley and Tony Allen"
Mike Conley or JJ Reddick
"Obviously not the best, by any stretch, but I figured I might as well represent…  Mike Conley Tony allen Shareef Abdur-Rahim Pau Gasol Marc Gasol  Most likely with Z-bo and Ja coming off the bench. Not a bad lineup, especially on defense, but it obviously doesn’t compare to the warriors."

"I'm not trolling?  I think KD and Curry is just the more dominant duo?  Great offense in basketball trumps great defense.  Curry and KD are just plain better offensive players than Kobe.  It's just a fact man.  If you want to go with career achievements then KD has by far the highest per game average of the four players(3pts higher than Kobe) and Curry is only behind Kobe in that category by less than a point.    Not to mention efficiency is a thing.  Curry has the third highest TS% of all time.  Durant is 11.  You're not going to believe this....but Kobe ranks #238, tied with Mike Conley.  Lmao it's not even close man."
Giannis is a power forward who often plays center. He is a big.  LeBron is straight up better than those guys. Forwards are inherently more valuable than guards because of their size and versatility. Great help defenders are also generally more valuable and harder to take out of the game than isolation specialists. LeBron is both. You might be able to entertain peak Artest vs. LeBron but his defensive prime was a flash in the pan compared to LeBron's.   Everything I said is reflected in postseason DRAPM which LeBron is #1 in since '98 among perimeter players. Here is what the rest of the list looks like.  Among qualifying players (2000+ MP):      1. LeBron James (2.28)      2. Kawhi Leonard ( 2.09)      3. Tony Allen (2.09)      4. Josh Howard (2.00)      5. Shawn Marion (1.84)      6. Paul George (1.72)      7. Jason Kidd (1.70)      8. Tayshaun Prince (1.67)      9. Rajon Rondo (1.64)      10. Bruce Bowen (1.53)      11. Danny Green (1.50)      12. Mike Conley (1.40)      13. Dwyane Wade (1.37)      14. Luol Deng (1.25)      15. Metta World Peace (1.23)  Kawhi is basically an upgraded version of Jordan defensively and LeBron is ahead of him while playing with minimal rim protection most of his prime.
1. Ben Simmons  2. Kyle Lowry  3. Jamal Murray  4. Mike Conley  5. Fred VanVleet  6. Colin Sexton  7. Malcolm Brogdon  8. LaMelo Ball  9. D'Angelo Russell  10. Lonzo Ball
"I was more talking about how they hacked him , how they guard him, and how it stalled their offense. I genuinely think Sixers would have better postseason runs with Mike Conley"
The Mike conley disrespect has to stop. He had a career year from 3 and was the focal point of the 1 seed when Mitchell was out. He's definitely top 7
"He was literally a burden in the playoffs. When you are harming your team on such a big stage like that, it is hard to vouch for him.  I rather have a traditional point guard who can make plays in the half court and shoot the basketball, when it comes to winning. Yeah simmons will get you more regular seasons wins but he got exposed.   I'll take Mike Conley over Ben Simmons without batting an eye"
1. Jamal Murray (assuming health) 2. Ben Simmons 3. Mike Conley 4. Kyle Lowry 5. LaMelo Ball (Hot take?: Will be #2 end of the season) 6. Malcolm Brogdon 7. Fred VanVleet 8. Collin Sexton 9. Lonzo Ball 10. D'Angelo Russell  I think its pretty cool that D'Angelo Russell is like the 20th best point guard in the league. We're really stacked at that position and should be for a long time since we seemingly get 1-2 franchise point guards in the draft each year.
"You have it backwards. He takes more shot attempts *because* he’s a better scorer. He’s not a better scorer *because* he takes more shot attempts.   &gt;So since Sexton averages 10 ppg than Simmons and Draymond, he is better than both of them now. That’s what u are making it sound like.   It’s not. You don’t understand how to compare aspects of basketball on a spectrum. According to you, this is how we should rank players.  Sexton - only good at scoring = 1 point   Lonzo - good at passing and defence = 2 points  Draymond - good at passing and defence = 2 points  Simmons - good at passing and defence = 2 points   Therefore all these players are better than Sexton. You aren’t understanding that the *degree* of how good they are is important. It’s not a binary on/off switch. Simmons and Draymond being DPOY level defenders isn’t the same thing as Lonzo being an above average defender. The level of “good” they are defensively holds a lot more weight than Lonzo’s level of “good” defence.   &gt;Lonzo overall is a better player than Sexton. When Sexton’s scoring is not available, what does he provide. When Lonzo’s 3 pt shot is off, he still gives u that playmaking and defense.  Let me ask you this. Are Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, and Kyle Lowry better than Kyrie Irving? They’re better at more things than him. When Kyrie’s shot isn’t available, what does he provide?"
1. Kyle Lowry 2. Jamal Murray (assuming he's healthy and up to what he was doing last season) 3. Malcolm Brogdon 4. Fred VanVleet 5. Mike Conley 6. Colin Sexton 7. LaMelo Ball 8. D'Angelo Russell 9. Lonzo Ball 10. Bum Simmons
Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Mike Conley  Lonzo  Ben Simmons  Brogdon  Vanvleet  Lamelo  Collin Sexton  D'Lo Russell  &amp;#x200B;  Bruh I dunno.
"At the time, the Grizzlies were defensive powerhouse that grinded out games which where some of the most low-scoring games of that era. That team was super enjoyable and it featured Memphis legends, known as the Core Four, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, Tony Allen.  Today, Ja Morant is easily one of the most entertaining players in the league and it's looking like this is his breakout year. The rest of or team has plenty of studs on it as well. If you want to hop on the train now we're a budding playoff team and should be in contention in a few years if everything goes right."
If my guy get snubbed for an all-star spot from Mike Conley again ill be fuming
No way. They will Mike Conley him into the hall of fame at some point.
"ANT is averaging 9 potential assists and 3 real assists per game. Along with Paul George, 10.7 potential assists and 4.2 real assists, and Mike Conley, 9.4 potential assists and 3.6 real assists, ANT is one of a number of players suffering from a very low assist conversion rate due to very poor teammate shooting.   Some players will have better or worse assist conversion luck than others over a sufficiently large sample but you can expect most players to stabilize within the 45-55% range for assist conversion rate."
"You broke us in the Bubble man, our team has never and will never be the same since that series.   Also the PG position is finally starting to get it's due in terms of how incredibly important it is. Bucks trade for Jrue Holiday and go from being the biggest embarrassment in the league in the Bubble to hoisting the Larry O'Brien trophy the next year. Suns trade for Chris Paul and go from out of the playoffs to making the Finals. Jazz added Mike Conley and now they are a serious contender.   And obviously now for the best example, you guys added Kyle Lowry and look at the difference he's made to your team that got embarrassed last year."
Mike Conley. It was cool to get him in the all star game but spare me all this he's always been snubbed bullshit.
"the Jazz were missing Mike Conley, he’s more important to them than even they want to admit"
No like I said the impact stats don’t hold. Unless you think Mike Conley is more impactful than all those players. Or that Chris Boucher is more winning then Curry.
Last season he was 10 in RAPTOR WAR and 6. in total RAPTOR behind Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley so that’s just more ignorance.
"Utah without Mike Conley, which is actually surprising how different the team looks without him"
"&gt;Your entire comments are literally “I didn’t watch it and can’t reference any play or game, but here’s why it’s impossible.  Not once did I imply anything of the sort.  If you’re telling me you don’t see Jokic take it to the rack on the regular then I question how often you actually watch him. He’s the second best post scorer in the league behind Embiid and in addition takes guys off the dribble quite often. He’s an elite, three level scorer which includes taking it to the rim, among other things.   I think you’re confusing targeting Gobert with playing the game through your best player. Imo a targeted offence involves finding the weakest link in the defence (obviously not Gobert) and creating a *positional mismatch*. A great example is LeBron targeting Lou Williams in those Lakers/Clippers matchups.  Jokic going against Gobert is actually the complete opposite of a targeted offence. A targeted offence would have Jokic posting up Jordan Clarkson, Mike Conley and the like. Don’t get me wrong, Gobert can’t guard Jokic effectively. But Clarkson *definitely* can’t guard him and would fair much worse than Gobert.  Gobert being Jokic’s primary defender is just Utah doing their best to slow down an elite talent. Think of it this way: if Utah had the choice between Jokic posting up Gobert or posting up Donavon Mitchell, which one do you think they’d prefer? Obviously neither can stop him. But I think we both know who’d have a better chance at slowing him down. A targeted offence involves forcing a mismatch on the opposing defence’s *least* preferred defender.  Here’s a thought exercise. The Warriors go against the Bucks in the finals. Jrue Holiday, arguably the best guard defender in the league, is tasked as Steph’s primary defender. He does as good a job as he can, but Steph being Steph still feasts and drops an efficient 30 ppg. Does that mean he was targeting Jrue as the weak link in the defence? Or did Milwaukee assign Jrue as his primary defender and Steph played well because he’s that good?"
"I’m sure spouting “anybody who disagrees with me doesn’t watch basketball” is what you consider to be a valid point. Unfortunately your comments aren’t based in reality.  You’re confusing Jokic being able to score effectively against Gobert with hunting Gobert down specifically as a weakness in the defence. Same with the other guys. Being able to score against him effectively is not even close to the same thing as hunting him down as a weak point in the defence.   Jokic doesn’t specifically *look* to score against Gobert. He’s just good enough of a scorer to understand that he’s capable of scoring regardless of who’s guarding him. Like no shit it’d be easier for him to post up fucking Mike Conley and Donavan Mitchell. No rational player looks at Gobert and thinks “he’s the weak link in the defence, not Jordan Clarkson”. It just isn’t rational."
mike conley
"The most underrated ability is the humility to not take bad shots, especially as the game has shifted away from long 2s to 3s and layups. Especially for guys in the 12-25 mil salary range there’s just a lot of value in recognizing they aren’t among the very select few players that can be efficient on isos and midrange and sticking to efficient shot selection.  Mike Conley last year was a great example of this.  The 2013 and 2014 Spurs also seemed to have a dozen players that understood what shots they shouldn’t be taking and that was a massive part of their success."
"I gotta go with Mike Conley.   He gets spoken about like a top 5 pg alot back then in the grit and grind era. He gets paid like devin Booker Zach lavine level. He got put into the the all star game last season for being being ""snub"" all those years.   Half his accomplishments will be broken by ja morant by 5 seasons.   Then kemba walker. He shoots below average and he's only been able to go to the playoffs I think twice in that decade.  Then mike D toni  as a coach. Other than doc rivers which is obvious for many reasons has been soooo lucky to be put in opportunities to coach stacked teams.   Gifted Melo knicks. Turned out bad. Linsanity was talked the most about.   Gifted the super stack 2012 lakers. Turned out bad and kobe gets injured trying to carry.   Gifted the rockets. Couldn't even beat the warriors that one year and had harden with super star after superstar."
Mike Conley is also a Jr. lol
"He won't bust Bennett style, but I've been saying since before the draft his ceiling is a lot lower than y'all think. He's been billed as bigger than he is, and he's not crazy athletic or the super shifty kind either. I'll bet his career is about equal value to Mike Conley Jr (obv not making a player comparison, just value)"
Mike Conley is really important to this team…
No Mike Conley so Donovan really needs to break out of his shooting slump
"Ok, and I never said he wasn’t. You’re arguing against a point I didn’t make...  I don’t need to watch them to comment on his scoring...   I said if he continues scoring like this yeah he’s not worth the money. That’s almost 30% of a teams cap. Miami clearly didn’t sign him with the intention of him scoring like this and if he scores like this in the playoffs he’s not gonna move the needle enough for them to be a legit title contender. It’s very simple. Lowry has a skill set that allows him to still Be a good and impactful player when he’s not scoring well, again like a Chris Paul type of player or Mike Conley to an extent. But he wasn’t given a near max contract just to be a good and impactful player. He’s expected to be the catalyst that pushes them into legit contention, and if he continues to do what he’s been doing as a scorer, that’s more than likely not gonna happen."
hyped out of my motherfucking mind  it’s like if mike conley was a rookie again except he had the potential to be michael jordan  ja morant is so fucking cool  we’re gonna have an mvp one day. soon. idk like... tomorrow. AND HE LOVES US. he wants to be here!!!!!!! it’s the greatest feeling i’ve ever had as a grizzlies fan. i’m so excited i can’t contain it
"The 2015 Warriors played 260 / 1000 minutes against a starting PG, fully counting injured Jrue and Mike Conley. The WCF and Finals opponents were both down two starters. It's not even close"
"Pull your head out of your ass. Man really said “hobbled”. HE PUT UP 35-5-5 ON 45% FROM 3. You got a Steph curry performance out of a player nowhere near that caliber and have the audacity to say you’re missing your stars lmao. Talk about delusional   You were missing mike Conley, the third best player on your team. The clippers were missing kawhi Leonard, the best player in the series."
"Yes and like the rest of r/nba you fail to take into account that we were also playing a hobbled Donovan Mitchell. Just like no one mentions we missed Mike Conley in a few big games or Bojan Bogdonovic in the Denver series.  It’s pretty weird that somehow it’s an easy excuse for these teams if they lose to Utah because their star is injured, but if Utah is missing their stars it’s somehow not relevant at all?"
"2015, when [this happened](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/video-draymond-green-hits-mike-conley-in-the-injured-face-on-loose-ball/)"

"Agreed   AGREED.  No way. Steph needs KD to win. (2015 doesn’t count. Thunder missed the playoffs to injury, Mike Conley was hurt, and then Kyrie/Kevin Love were out.)"

The death of Mike Conley was greatly exaggerated
Mike Conley might be back idk
Is he going to take the mantle from Mike Conley/Jrue Holliday from a few seasons ago?
"Maybe I'm a bit too high on Fox in the late 30s, but he's an exciting young talent. I like to give young, exciting players that improve on a year-to-year basis the benefit of the doubt that they can get even better.  Realistically he's probably ""only"" top 50. Gordon Hayward, Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart, Nikola Vucevic, Goran Dragic &amp; Co. would probably all be players you would rather have in a play-off series if it took place tomorrow."

mike conley is an allstar
Mike “BOGO” Conley Jr.
I like the comp of a more offensive minded Grizzlies Mike Conley
"Mike Conley once got a technical and the league rescinded it after the game, leaving him with a record that is clean to this day"
anyone else remember Mike Conley Jr. being the Robin to Greg Oden's Batman?
Mike Conley / JC is the backcourt of my mid 2010s dreams....
Advanced stats absolutely love Mike Conley rn. I think according to [538's NBA rating system](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) Conley has been the third most impactful player in 2020-21 behind Jokic and Kawhi.
Mike Conley was constantly getting hacked on drives to the rim and almost never got the benefit of the whistle. Wouldn't be surprised if it's the same for him with the Jazz.  Z-Bo and Marc would get clobbered down low and almost never got a foul call.
"&gt; FG% says a lot about your shot selection.  I honestly disagree. FG% weighs all field goal attempts equally even though 3s are worth more than 2s. So even if you are shooting 3s at a great percentage, your overall FG% goes down because FG% just combines all shots together.   &gt;There are no players that only take 3s  Well yes of course, but it still is a problem to use FG% when it doesn't account for the extra point that you get for making a 3 pointer. Just to give a few examples Steph Curry, Tim Hardaway Jr., Mike Conley, and Donte DiVincenzo (all players with pretty differing playstyles btw) have a below league average FG% (46%), but an above average eFG% (53.2%).  I recommend that you please watch [this video](https://youtu.be/awL65UyXmA8) so you can understand what i mean"
"&gt;Ye, let's see him cook Gobert, KAT and just about any center in the league because he totally can't do that...  Which is not remotely what I said.  Smh, learn to read.  On this particular play, he takes advantage of the completely disinterested, borderline-nonexistent defense of Mike Conley, who appears to be daydreaming about his pregame nap or something, and is a full foot shorter even if he was trying to defend.  That's not very impressive."
"Exactly. Mike Conley, Bojan, JC etc all came after Goober Hopscotch left"
"Ok imagine thinking that about Francis, he was better than baron davis he just had a bad reputation because of drugs.   Francis was more efficient relative to era, francis before injuries had a career average of 2.4 ts% Conley's best 4 year stretch is 1.2   Francis was a much better finisher peaking at .639 and always being around 57% at the rim Conley's most efficient season has him shooting. 617 at the rim    Mike conley is a better shooter but their best 3point  shooting seasons aren't that far off Conley .408 on 6 attempts and francis .396 on 4 attempts    Steve francis also wasnt a loser he had a winning record in more than half his seasons in houston but divisions and a tough conference he didnt make the playoffs that often, he never had a marc gasol and zach Randolph teammate, his best teamate was sophomore Yao and they made the playoffs before he was the centerpiece in a tmac trade.    Conley is good but steve francis was better my friend although there advanced stats are similar"
"...He couldn't make the all star at the weakest time in NBA history for big men. I would say no, Mike Conley should've made it if not for playing at the strongest time in history for Point Guards."
"Ya I understand the question, each Franchises All-Time Team would be the favorites, Grizz starters would be Zach Randolph, Marc and Pau, Shareef, Conley, with guys like Ja, Battier, Allen, Gay, Posey, and Mike Miller off the bench. Cmon lmao"
I'm guessing Mike Conley was born in Arkansas cuz he grew up and played in Indiana.. shoulda went with Joe Johnson you can argue he's still active from big3 and other leagues
It's weird to see Mike Conley listed as Arkansas since he won three state championships in Indiana.

Mike Conley showing up and helping D-Mitch on offense + Jordan Clarkson giving everyone buckets has really transformed them.
"This is what we thought they’d be last season, but you’re right mike Conley clearly wasn’t right early last season"
Memphis Mike Conley has returned to win a ring in Utah
"I was really high on them entering last year, until Mike Conley got hurt twice and Bogdanovic missed the entire year.  Now that they're both back, they've been balling.  Plus Derrick Favors??   Nuts."
I think the biggest difference has been Mike Conley playing like Mike Conley instead of the shell of himself he was most of last year  EDIT: And Jordan Clarkson has been even more legit

Mike Conley has been balling out. He finally clicked with Quin Snyder's system.
Mike Conley and Donovan Mitchell are the most handsome back court in the NBA and it's not even close
are we getting a new Mike Conley RAPTOR thread every day
Mike Conley though

Can we please get Mike Conley to the All-Star game?
Could this finally be the year Mike Conley makes it?
Fox is similar player to Mike Conley back in Memphis

"I'm hoping Mike Conley with cockiness. IQ seems to have his head screwed on right, even Clyde has praised his intelligence and he doesn't turn the ball over easily. Obviously at this point he's nowhere near as efficient of a shooter as Conley was, but it's 9 games and I've seen him make decisions that are that of a 25 year old, not a rookie.  I like the George Hill comparison too. I also see a lot of Shumpert in his game, hopefully with a lot more upside and more control of the ball. IQ feels like a more fun version of either Conley or Hill."
Go Mike Conley!
"mike conley first time all star 2021, you heard it here first"
Mike Conley
Mike Conley  Jordan Clarkson
"if somebody makes hourly posts about a player being underrated, he is no longer underrated. I propose calling this the mike conley rule"
Mike Conley deserves a mention
"I mean they probably could’ve been in the playoffs but I don’t think a true contending team can have Mike Conley as their best player, especially when there are teams headlined by guys like MJ or Hakeem."
I got high with Mike Conley Jr. in high school.
Mike Conley
"As is, I don't think they make it out the East with out another PG. Lowry is the best bet. If the Sixers just close the books on this season, I think Mike Conley is available in FA."
Is Mike Conley the 2nd best player in the league? No? Then we shouldn't treat fucking 538 as the basketball gods
nah mike conley&gt;letrash
"The sheer number of talented, productive guards in the West right now is insane. Understanding that SGA is the clear alpha on a team tanking (well, supposed to be tanking LOL), you have production lines that are right up there with the guys most would have penciled in to be All Stars at the start of the season.   Unless I missed a change to All Star lineups, at MOST the West can name 6 backcourt players to the roster. It's going to be a travesty that a minimum of THREE of these guys are going to be snubbed this year:  Steph Curry Damian Lillard Luka Doncic Devin Booker Chris Paul Donovan Mitchell Shai Gilgeous-Alexander CJ McCollum Mike Conley"

Marc Gasol/Mike Conley and Allen Iverson
" No Bogdan. No Trae. Don't give a shit, we're the best team in the NBA and we're going to fucking set the league on fire. We're going to shoot so many fucking threes that head coaches get fired, stars get fucking traded, and fans cry salty ass bitch tears of grief as Donovan dunks on their best player, Rudy Swats that fucking shit, and Bogey ascends into heaven with a stepback three. Jordan Clarkson will start his own new religion as a Filipino deity of love and vengeance as he finishes the season as both the MVP and 6MOY. Azubuike wins ROY playing garbage minutes in the 4th because we are up 20 at that point anyway. Teams forfeit in the playoffs rather than go against the Jingler or the fucking Minivan. Mike Conley and Daddy Favs become the first co-Finals MVPS as they wipe the floor with the Charlotte Hornets, while Haygood breaks his finger in game four while down 20, destroying any chances that they come back. Jazz Basketball is officially back."
Give him some time. Mike Conley looked like he forgot how to play basketball past year when he was traded to the Jazz. Now look at him.
Bruh they had Mike Conley do a 3 day quarantine when he entered the bubble after the birth of his son. The NBA doesnt actually care. Its just for optics.
"There are lots of defensive specialists in the league that won't get all-star votes though. Dort, as an example.  But people just aren't gonna vote for a guy scoring 13 points per game for All-Star, even if he's very valuable as a real-world player. It's also really hard to look at Simmons in a vacuum without Embiid and Thybulle around--both of which are excellent defenders.  (Also, last I looked at defensive metrics, Mike Conley was actually the highest-rated guard.. and also has no votes. So that's definitely not just about Simmons in this regard.)"
Mike Conley. Mike Bibby. Jalen Rose. Lamar Odom. Richard Jefferson. Andre Miller.
"I completely agree, Snyder is much better and much more versatile. Was just saying first seed doesn't always equal finals/conference finals. Again, not hating on the Jazz, I hope they make the finals tbh. Mike Conley deserves a ring."
"As good as the 60 win Hawk team was, I don’t believe Korver and Teague should’ve been all stars. Surprises would be Mike Conley but that’s only cause he always played in the West stacked with guards. If he was in the East, he probably would’ve made it to one or two all star games."
"Kyle Korver, Mike Conley"
"Hell, Mike Conley is still having this problem and he IS on a good team lol. Some players just aren't flashy enough or play in the big market media areas."
"mhm, fred vv and mike conley are top 5 players"
So who was it that told me Mike Conley was gonna be an all star? Klay Thompson got more votes than him lmao
"Oh Mike conley is better too huh?!?? 😂 Please keep going is Ingles secretly better too? I guess these are secrets only jazz fans who watch every game every minute will know right? Gtfoh   This sub is infatuated with the idea that simply being a fan makes you an expert. Or simply watching all 48 minutes of all 82 games makes them an expert. Or that if they follow the narrative of the site they’re right. No, no, no. That’s when I know someone doesn’t  know shit, not confident enough to form your own opinion   “Fans” and this sub have been in love with Gobert and have been quietly downplaying Mitchell for years , then you were church mouse quiet when Mitchell turned into  jordan and averaged almost 45 a game for a series—while Gobert was a non factor in a high scoring series where Jokic averaged 26,27. Oh I ‘watched the whole game’ for that   It is Mitchell that is the guy bc he’s the one getting buckets. Period.  Ive said this so many times on here: offense and defense are not equally weighted. Gobert as an amazing rim protector does not equal Mitchell being the engine offensively and the closer and scorer and guy who gets the mismatches and breaks the D down to kick to all those shooters. This sub wants defense to be just as important as offense so bad"
"1st team should be Rudy Gobert, Lebron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ben Simmons, Shake Milton.  2nd team should be Joel Embid, Christian Wood, Anthony Davis, Mike Conley. Not sure about the other guard.   Myles Turner and OG Anunoby shouldn't make all-defense. Leading the league in blocks/steals has a separate award."
Mountain Mike Conley who is playing extremely well on both ends of the floor.
"I hate the, ""they deserve this amount of all stars"" thing. The Jazz have two all stars with a borderline third. But, just cause they are really good doesn't mean Mike Conley should be an all star over Fox."
Mike Conley or De'Aaron Fox. Both cases would be a snub imo it's unfortunate.
&gt; so even losing three in a very tough stretch of the schedule   Potentially without Mike Conley too.
"Jazz are the team I thought they’d be last year after acquiring the great Mike Conley. He struggled last year for whatever reason but now he’s back and make no mistake about it, there’s a convincing argument that they are the most legit threat to the Lakers."
"Yup. To me a snub is a guy who has actually been playing better than someone who got voted over him. So like if Shai, Fox, or Ja Morant get voted in over Mike Conley, that would make Conley a snub."
"If the last decade is any indication, Mike Conley"
I don't catch most of the games. I've seen a couple but Mike Conley seems to be like their second best player this season but Mitchell has really turned it on the past couple games since Conley went down with injury
"Serious question cause I don’t see a whole lot of Utah games, is Mike Conley their third best player?"
"It’s common basketball knowledge the best player right now(lebron)on the best team(Lakers, I have them finishing as the one seed not the jazz this year) is the MVP. Same reason Giannis won it last year, he had the stats and the record to back it up. Conley doesn’t. Lebrons stats actually contribute to winning basketball not losses like Jokic and Curry so he’s ahead of them and mike Conley isn’t the best player on the jazz it’s Donovan Mitchell so he doesn’t qualify. There’s your MVP qualification"
Besides Utah really. I guess if you count Mike Conley as one of their stars. Even with him out they're still blowing people out
"Sure, but I don't think you can say he's unambiguously this team's best player, can you? Gobert and even Mike Conley are arguably having better seasons than he is. It's really more of a team effort."
Would be nice to finally see Mike Conley get an All-Star selection. Especially since he looked washed last year and it seemed like he’d never have another shot.
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. Damian Lillard 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Bradley Beal 6. Chris Paul 7. Trae Young 8. Demar Derozan 9. Kyle Lowry 10. Donovan Mitchell 11. Devin Booker 12. CJ McCollum 13. Jrue Holiday 14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Ja Morant 16. Zach Lavine 17. Mike Conley 18. Jamal Murray 19. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Fred Van Vleet 21. Malcolm Brogdon 22. Kemba Walker 23. Russell Westbrook 24. Collin Sexton 25. Marcus Smart
"Definitely would be the team with the clearest lack of a superstar since the 2004 pistons, but they could also be the 2014 Spurs. Still, that team was way more stacked in terms of resumé. It'd be awesome to see Mike Conley get some national attention after a long career of being an also-ran."
"&gt; There are so many players you could replace Simmons with and this would be the outcome, not even high level players; Mike Conley or even Trae Young could've done so.   Gotta be the funniest thing I've read in this sub in a while."
But this sub told me that Mike Conley is their best player lmao
"Since it gets Mike Conley a ring, imma say yes"
I feel like no matter what he does Mike Conley will never be an all star (sadly)
Jazz were short handed. They are missing starting PG Mike Conley.
Mike Conley Jr +/- god
mike conley looks like he wore his bath robe to this game.
ctrl + f mike conley  nothing  the disrespect...
All that being said the Jazz are clearly much better with this year's version of Conley running the point. They were demolishing teams with Mike in there. They really miss him getting everyone into their spots and controlling the game. But there's no doubt that when you put the ball in Mitchells hand he's gonna put up big numbers.
Even without All Star Mike Conley ggwp
"And then you add Mike Conley to the mix? ~~You~~ the chances of winnin', drastic go down!"
"I never said you called him a bad coach  But Kerr is top 5, and Donovan is nowhere near that. Completely different tiers  Imagine if I said “I don’t think steph is WAY better than mike Conley”   Cmon man"
I'm just happy we're playing well without Conley. Mountain Mike takes this offense to a whole new level.
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
"Nick Nurse has 16 technicals this year, which is 16 more technical fouls than Mike Conley has gotten in his entire career."
A true underrated player. This sub thinks Mike Conley deserves an all star nod over somebody like fox...
It's actually Mike Conley
Jazz for me. I didn't think theyd be this good. Plus the Mike Conley redemption arc is nice to see.
you think that guy is seriously advocating for dallas to trade luka and porzingis and receive GEORGES NIANG and mike conley and calling it a trade that benefits all parties?  not to mention suns giving up booker. it’s a joke trade because the guy wants book and luka.
"I would vote Conley, Mountain Mike, Memphis Mike, Money Mike, Michael Conley Jr. in that order."
Can I turn a miss into a make? If so - Mike Conley vs the Nuggets.
Mike Conley in game 7 😓
"1.) The best player on those Zags teams that are referenced here was Adam Morrison.   2.) He was playing college guys in pick up.   3.) At 50 Russ, CP3, Mike Conley, Steve Nash, AI, Kyrie, ""name a guy who was a top 5 guard at one point in their career"", will cook college players too. The argument made in that comment isnt well supported.  Just flattening these weird oldhead takes where I see em."
"Jazz have had Mike Conley out last 3. Would be sweet to see Jaylen and Mike on the court.  Thanks for letting “He Who Must Not Be Named” leave for the Bobcats. Now I can like the Celtics again. I already hated Charlotte, so I’m even there.   Correction, hate them More since finding out Melvin Capital - Gabe Plotkin is a part owner. 🤢"

"lmao Stockton couldnt could get through Olajuwon/Horry   and Westbrook was the 2nd best player on a championship level team at 22 and and an MVP at 27, that’s as high and a higher level than Stockton played at. that means Westbrook gives you more chances to win championships     it’s like if you would take Mike Conley over Penny Hardaway. yeah Conley has been a great player for a long time and he will always give you quality minutes, but when you need to win a championship, you get a guy like Penny Hardaway"
All time?  Everyone knows about Conley but Mike Bibby is in the conversation too. Also wild that Camby was DPOY and didn't make all star. Monte Ellis and Lamar Odom would round out my team
"Those were my favorite moments of high school ball. I played in central Indiana, our sectional my senior year had a team with Josh McRoberts, a team with Eric Gordon, and another team with Mike Conley and Greg Oden. They all obviously destroyed us whenever we played, but I distinctly remember Mike Conley. Our PG was our best player, he ended up playing D3 college. But Mike Conley just dog walked him up and down the court one game, even though he was a year or two younger. I remember our coach just yelling at him because he's turning the ball over, he's getting his pocket picked, he can't stay in front of him. He just had a rough game, but what was he supposed to do? He eventually came to the bench and sat down and was like, ""I don't know what coach wants me to do here. He's *just better than me.*"" Which is a hard thing to admit in high school when you are pretty good yourself haha. At a certain point, what are you supposed to do when there is someone who is just better than you."
"Mike Conley, Serge Ibaka, Harrison Barnes, Fred Van Vleet and Marcus Smart"
"Best pg not to get All-Star nomination is Mike Conley, no cap 🧢"
I don’t know many things but I do know that Mike Conley is the best RAPTOR
&gt;I kinda get RAPTOR. In that I get Mike Conley is the best player in the nba and it supports that thesis.  very strong data analysis. i like that
"Same with Mike Conley. Pacers Jazz Finals confirmed. Insert clip of Don pointing at the Pistons fan wearing NBA logo over face ""you did this"". Pacers West vs Jazz East 2021 Finals has been foretold"
"Mike Conley, leading the league in +/- on the number 1 seed, snubbed from the snub list smh"
Mike Conley remains undefeated as the greatest NBA player of all time with zero All Star appearances
Kills me that Mike Conley got snubbed. He deserves one appearance for his career.
Wait wait wait? You’re telling me MIKE CONLEY ISNT AN ALL STAR???!!!! B-b-but his net rating is so good!
Ok now y’all look at this list and tell me who Mike Conley deserved to make it over
"This.  It's really dumb that Mike Conley was never an All Star simply because he never played east of Memphis, when clearly worse players got all star recognition."
"Where's my man, Mike Conley?!? More of an impact player than CP3 or Donovan Mitchell."
"they aren’t even the same position though. I don’t get the hate on Zion from this. I’m seeing so many tweet out (many of which in sports media) that Zion making it is only for marketing purposes, that it’s bs, etc etc. He legit deserved to make it. I’m sure Booker will get in as the AD replacement, and he deserves to, but we also have a guy like Mike Conley who is deserving as well. The west for guards is insane."
"I mean he’ll be getting in over Fox,SGA,Mike Conley,Derozan and Ja Morant. It’s still an honor"
I can not believe mike Conley has still never been named an all star. I mean I’d would be hard to name him over d book. But he seriously deserves an all star nod
"Dude it’s just hard to be a guard in the west. He made it last year. It’s unfortunate but all his counting stats are down from last year. He’s averaging 24/4/3. Who do you replace to put him in?  Dame? LOL.  Donovan Mitchell? Same exact stats and MUCH better defense on the best team in the NBA. Sorry. PG13? Better numbers, better efficiency, MUCH better defense, better team. Sorry. Chris Paul? Maybe. Could’ve been a toss up between the two of them. Paul got the nod, I’d have given it to Book, but I don’t argue with the decision.  The kicker is that AD will miss the game and they’ll have to name a replacement. I assume it’ll go to Mike Conley (because of the narrative and that fact that by almost every conceivable advanced metric he’s been the best player in the NBA this year), but I wouldn’t be surprised if Booker gets it.  Tl;dr: there’s a lot of incredible players in the west and an absolute max of 7 backcourt all-star spots. Booker is arguably the 7the or 8th best backcourt player in the conference. “The excuses have run out” seems pretty dramatic."
"Glad Vuc made it, he clearly deserves it but I was worried they'd hold the magic's record against him. But damn no Mike Conley still. What does this guy have to do to get a nod already? If any team deserves three all stars it's the Jazz.    Hope he gets named as the injury replacement for Davis at least."
MIKE MOTHER FUCKING CONLEY  ^really Booker
"Fuck the NBA and their coaches for not putting in Mike Conley. All the excuses to never put him in, all gone this season, and they still won't.   I'm not watching this game. Fuck it."
CP3  edit: and Mike Conley Jr over Zion.
Disappointed in the lack of Mike Conley Jr. This season was probably his best chance of making it.
It should be Mike Conley
mike conley is not an all star. he falls in to the life time achievement award
Mike Conley deserves that spot
Didn't even mention Mike Conley
"I wanted Mike Conley to get in, but yeah, it will be Booker over him"
"Good points there. I don't think the team being middle of the pack is really relevant, as we have fairly weak defenders outside of Turner right now. The Jazz have Mike Conley (above average), Donovan Mitchell (above average), Bojan Bogdanovic (average), Royce O'Neal (elite), and Ingles (borderline elite) off the bench."
"Wouldn’t put that all on Harrell. Quick guards are still killing us in the PnR. Mike Conley, Sexton, Fox, etc."
Its definitely not the biggest problem. The knicks would have been both incompetent AND offering Mike Conley 10M more than whatever Memphis could have given him.
Devin Booker 25/4/4 on 50/38/85 61% TS  Donovan Mitchell 25/4/5 on 43/39/83 56% TS  Chris Paul 17/5/9 on 49/40/97 59% TS  Mike Conley 16/3/6 on 44/41/82 59% TS  Demar DeRozan 20/5/7 on 49/33/89 60% TS  Three of these players should be all-stars. Tell me there is no world in which Booker deserves it.
I’d rather have Mike Conley get the replacement nod. Give that man an all star.
"Royce O’Neal, Donavan Mitchell, Clarkson, even Mike Conley are all shooting their most attempts on career high percentages, the team is shooting like 5 more threes on like 4 percent higher percentage, with the same team basically. Don’t get me wrong the jazz are one of the best teams in the league but to say they’re better than a bucks team that had a better record in night in night out harder environments is not being fair considering the advantage they have over that bucks team. The jazz come out and execute almost perfectly a game plan that benefits from playing in this environment. As with the bucks, the jazz got a lot to prove before anybody really cares. The regular season means almost nothing with no fans."
LaMelo really Kurosawa'd the fuck out of Mike Conley  (that was a subtle nod to noted filmmaker Akira Kurosawa)
Don't ever call Mike Conley small again 😤
Mike Conley is an incredibly nice person IRL just thought I’d share.
"You blew a 3-1 lead to the injured nuggets with Mitchell averaging MJ stats. 6 vs 3 seed btw  You lost to the rockets two times   And proceeded to add Mike Conley and Bojan. I’ll take that over Lebron and AD, Kawhi and PG."
"Tbh the fact that it’s east vs west and basically a popularity contest has already watered it down. The idea that Mike Conley would be a multi-year Allstar in the east, but never made it in the west actually backs that up imo — where you play shouldn’t matter really, should just be top 24 players"
I usually love this stuff but it’s Mike Conley. Dude is so wholesome even I felt bad for him.
Mike Conley: *I need someone to hold me the whole night through.*
He acting like mike Conley ain’t a grown ass man🤣🤣
Mike “Classy” Conley is the only MVP favourite to not get exposed unlike LeFraud and EmFraud. He’s the run away favourite rn
Mike Conley is too small to win mvp
The Church of Mike Conley has enlightened another soul
"Fraudbiid and LeMickey are frauds, Mike Conley MVP"
"The moment LaMelo Ball disrespected Mike Conley, this game was over. I don’t care how nice his game is, you don’t come in as a rookie and disrespect the most universally respected vet in the league for no reason. He was doing it to get back at Royce O’Neale, but like… say something to Royce then. Mike doesn’t deserve that shit, especially from a kid."
Also made a rookie mistake taunting Mike Conley.
"&gt;but why you gotta taunt Mike? He’s like the nicest guy in the league     Nothing personal. Players just taunt when they get hyped. Nothing to do with Mike Conley.. in general   It happens much less now because the league's officiating is soft as fuck these days. But taunting has always been a part of the game. It also gets the fans all hyped up  &gt;  Almost every point guard would be ""small"" compared to a 6'6 player like LaMelo. Conley is no different. Taunting happens. It also provides a psychological advantage to many.   &gt;  Just the hype and adrenaline in the moment. If the NBA officiating wasn't so soft in todays era.. we would have seen much more taunting and trash talk. It was always one of the best things about the sport.. Created RIVALRIES as well"
"The moment LaMelo Ball disrespected Mike Conley, this game was over. I don’t care how nice his game is, you don’t come in as a rookie and disrespect the most universally respected vet in the league for no reason. He was doing it to get back at Royce O’Neale, but like… say something to Royce then. Mike doesn’t deserve that shit, especially from a kid."
"And more, nice lol. Mike Conley and Zion over both of them is a prettyyyy big stretch."
"In no particular order, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, Mike Conley, And more. Not to say they don’t deserve an all star, but the west is to stacked for me to rank them above these guys."
"We're averaging the most 3 pointers per game by any team in NBA history and our rotation players, minus the big men, just shoot an insanely efficient clip on high volume. I'll repost this table from another comment, that's accurate as of the completion of tonights game.     |Player|G|3P|3PA|3P%| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Joe Ingles|27|68|147|**46.26%**| |Royce O'Neale|31|53|126|**42.06%**| |Mike Conley|25|70|170|**41.18%**| |Bojan Bogdanović|31|78|200|**39.00%**| |Donovan Mitchell|29|98|252|**38.89%**| |Jordan Clarkson|31|100|263|**38.02%**| |Georges Niang|31|37|101|**36.63%**|"
"We've got shooters everywhere that it's kinda ridiculous that Niang is only the 7th best shooter (by % this year even tho he's at 41.0% and 40.0% the last two seasons) in our rotation, apart from Gobert and Favors.      |Player|G|3P|3PA|3P%| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Joe Ingles|27|68|147|**46.26%**| |Royce O'Neale|31|53|126|**42.06%**| |Mike Conley|25|70|170|**41.18%**| |Bojan Bogdanović|31|78|200|**39.00%**| |Donovan Mitchell|29|98|252|**38.89%**| |Jordan Clarkson|31|100|263|**38.02%**| |Georges Niang|31|37|101|**36.63%**|"
But Mike Conley is so nice. He wouldn’t do that.
"Grit N Grind Grizzlies’ Pay Gasol and (can we add another current player here) Mike Conley. Oh yeah, this is my bet"
lmaooooo  mike conley is like 10x better than kemba rn.
"How do you defend Joe Ingles, Rudy Gobert, and Mike Conley"
"&gt; KD has probably the best shot selection in the league other than Kawhi.  I wouldn't say they have great shot selection, I'd say that they both are excellent bad shot makers. They make bad, low efficiency shots really, really well. That bodes well for late game playoff situations where it's harder to generate offense and the game becomes ISO ball/mismatch hunting because teams want to reduce turnovers and put the ball in their best players hands to make a play. But you don't want to run your offense for a full 48 minute game like that.   The best shots are still the ones at the rim, Harden can get to the rim whenever he wants to. KD *used* to be able to do that, unsure of whether he can anymore after the injury.   &gt; don't compare either of KD or Harden to Dame and CJ ever again please.  You're missing the point, it's about different roles.   Engine of the Offense - This is Harden's role and he's probably the 2nd best player in the league at it behind LeBron. This role is about playmaking, running the offense, most of these guys average 8 assists per game or more, but they can also score when they need to, they're dual threats. Jokic is elite at this too, so is Dame, and then the 2 next gen guys who are elite are Trae, who is basically discount Dame, and Luka, who is basically discount Harden. Russ used to be great in this kind of role when he played smart. Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley were all great at this, all of them aren't able to carry that kind of load anymore, which is why they are sliding into a lesser role in order to let Booker, Mitchell, VanVleet attempt to take on this kind of responsibility. But this kind of player is whom you need to run your offense over the course of a 48 minute game.   Kawhi has taken on in this kind of role on the Clippers, although you can argue he should be in the latter role as that better suits him, and he's not good enough at this role, he's not elite.  The Drive Line of the Offense - This is KD's role and he's probably the best in the league at it. This role is about shot-making ability, scoring efficiently from all 3 levels of the floor, but most importantly the mid-range and 3-point line, because these are the shots that are taken at the end of games. They are your secondary ball-handlers and generally get around ~5 assists per game. Other great players in this kind of role are Steph, Kyrie, Middleton, Kawhi, PG, CJ, Jamal Murray etc. AD was able to be this for the Lakers last year.   Any great team needs 1 of each of these type of players in order to win a championship.   The engine of the offense type can do more alone in terms of regular season wins, but has a hard ceiling on it, and will stall out in the playoffs, typically around the 2nd round. The drive line of the offense type is more dependent on the engine of the offense type, but is the player that's necessary to take a team from the 2nd round to the Finals/championship.   Kawhi is a good reference point in this, he took a team with a very good and one of the most underrated engine of the offense type players in Kyle Lowry, a team that perennially made the 2nd round every year, and he was the difference in that team breaking over that barrier and getting to the Finals and winning a championship.   Kawhi is now trying to be the engine of the offense for the Clippers, but they lost in the 2nd round last year, because he's not elite in that role. And because PG wasn't good enough in the Drive Line role. Kawhi is trying to be more like LeBron, when he should go back to trying to be like KD, that's the best use of him. And in order for that to happen, Clippers need an engine of the offense type player."
"Jimmy Butler, Vucevic, Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley. All bad men. All players who rarely get the recognition they deserve."
"he's the perfect example of a guy who's gonna be a hugely impactful player at 27 and have a long late career life. Mike Conley wasn't that good for a while either but when it starts to click for young point guards, the steps and the strides between them get bigger and bigger. I'm not saying he's ever gonna be even a top twenty player but I think he can be a fringe all star guy, especially if he ends up out of the west."
"There’s a million different things to explain the poor ratings other than “Lebron fatigue”...  having no fans takes away a big aspect of the viewing experience, the lakers vs heat matchup was just bad, people have been fed up with nba’s BLM stance, etc etc etc  Having LeBron in the Finals is the best way to pull people that dont usually watch the nba because theyre going to at least know lebron. if someone that doesnt watch the nba turns on the finals and its tudy gobert, donovan mitchell, mike conley making up one of thr teams theyre gonna say who tf are these guys and turn it off."
Mike Conley and Marc Gasol
Reddick is the last guy I expect to get ejected aside from dudes like Kawhi or Mike Conley.
"Lol he’s going Mike Conley on this sub, where people say he’s underrated so much that he gets overrated. He’s a great player, but he’s not top 10. Bron, KAwhi, KD, Steph, Harden, Giannis, Dame, Jokic, Embiid, Luka, AD are all easily over him, and more, I just named an easy 11."
That would never happen to Mike Conley
Wish some players would go the mike conley route and just shut the fuck up and play basketball.
Mike Conley and Julius Randle seem to and they look to miss out this year
Lost on a missed buzzer beater in 7 to the Nuggets.   Without Bogey. With the worst backup C in the league. With a Mike Conley who had not yet really meshed with the team.
"Mike Conley deserves recognition, but looking back at his career, I can't see he was ever snubbed. Th West went from Kobe, Paul, Nash and Parker to Westbrook, Harden, Curry, Booker and Luka. The only thing I could say is he'd have probably made a team or two in the East."
"Yeah, in the Ty Lawson, Mike Conley, Eric Bledsoe tier"
Mike Conley would’ve made the all star game like 2-4 times had he played in the East. Dude is gonna down as the GOAT non all star. It used to be Monta Ellis (in the modern NBA)
"&gt; Mike Conley? This might be his only chance  Feels like I’ve been saying that for a decade, truly hope that dude gets some recognition this year"
"I'm far more ""concerned"" about the guys who aren't going to make it than the guys who are either going to be a starter or first selected to the bench.   Luka is going to be an all-star again. He's gonna be a starter again.   Mike Conley? This might be his only chance."
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
Mike Conley might be the most handsome man in the league no 🧢
Mike Conley was good for 1 quarter and it’s been downhill ever since
Today I learned mike Conley is stronger than Kawhi and can knock him over easily
Jamal Murray.   There's a 2% chance you get Jordan/Kobe. 8% chance you get Mike Conley. 90% chance you get Seth Curry.
Mike conley may never miss again
I'm scared of Mike Conley. He's a certified Clipper killer lmao
Does Mike Conley miss bro
Pretty much.  Like a Center Mike Conley.
jazz fan earlier said mike conley would be an all-star if he was on the lakers lmfao. fuckin 16 and 6 lmfao
Great argument. Boiling down Ben Simmons v. trae Young with a Mike Conley v Steph Curry in 2015 analogy. Shamefully stupid lmao.
"The gap between them on offence is so massive that the “Simmons does both” shit isn’t a good argument.   Back in 2015, Mike Conley was a way better defensive player than Steph Curry and also a good offensive player. Curry was still much better because of how much better his offensive game was."
If he gets traded I think it would be something like Mike Conley and as many picks and swaps as they can get. They would let Dame pick where he wants to go and I think Utah would be his first pick.
"I mean, fuck Rudy Gobert. But Mike Conley love is greater. Hope they win."
"maintaining the same ratio other PGs do at lower volumes isnt impressive and all three of the guy you mentioned are around the top in the league in turnovers themself. Chris paul, Ricky rubio, FVV, Mike conley...those guys are elite playmakers and they crush westbrook in ast/to.  i would also caution against any metric that suggests demar derozan is one of the best passers in the nba. hes really good but i think situation counts for a lot on both cases. westbrook has a ton of weapons at his disposal."
"Toronto was obviously a special thing for Gasol to be a part of- plus it was kind of special for Canada at large.   But dude- if Conley were to end up securing the chip for Utah?  Like, let's hypothetically say they win it all and Mike gets Finals MVP.  Salt Lake City might literally have a statue constructed and I'm not even kidding.  Certainly a street or landmark.  Lol the Jazz are everything there."
every grizz fans want Jazz to win it anyway right? for Mike Conley?
"Nah, Zero pts.  He's still young and can change his game like Mike Conley did but as of right now, it looks like the Lakers dodged a bullet from paying him 22+ mil a yr."
"We're booing him because he's overly aggressive, talks mad shit, head butts and punches Mike Conley, is an overall pest, and seems to take delight in playing the role of villain. In spite of his antics, I actually think he is a pretty exceptional player with a chance to be great."
"Paul George, Derrick Rose, Robert Covington, Markell Fultz, Tim Hardaway Jr., DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, TJ McConnell, Russell Westbrook, Jabari Parker, Jaylen Brown, Bryn Forbes, Julius Randle, Kelly Oubre, and many others can't name off the top of my head."
We paid Mike Conley like $35 million this season. He's been great but nobody would argue that CP3 wouldn't be an upgrade. And he'll probably command less than that per year--the real risk is if you commit to 3+ years.
\*Mike Conley has entered the chat\*
"As a Grizz fan, I am really happy with this performance. Two straight victories in ""win and in"" games, even one beating Steph and the Warriors. Then a hard fought series against the Jazz where they had a chance very late in most games and took one. Really hoping the Jazz go on to win it too. I would love to see Mike Conley get a ring and seeing a true team beat the nets World order would be too sweet."
"The Jazz were clearly the better team and this game they played like it. Mitchell is playing as well as I've ever seen him and I hope that continues throughout the playoffs, I love that guy. In fact, (save for Gobert) I love the entire Jazz team. Y'all play so well together and are so talented, people underestimate Conley, Bogdonavic, O'Neal, Ingles, and Favors. Combine that with Mitchell, Gobert, and Clarkson, that is a solid 8 man rotation with a sprinkle of Niang, man to me that's a championship team.  The Jazz play some beautiful ball, I am gonna root for that Jazz championship. Get Mike that Ring!"
Proud! Now fully on the Mike Conley ring bandwagon. Fade me!
Mike Conley
Mike Conley would like to know your location.
the ghost of mike conley 😔  add him to the list at earnestine &amp; hazel's
Imagine being the best PG in a starting lineup that also includes Mike Conley 🔥 🔥 🔥
"In fairness it’s sometimes hard to pick only 3 superstars from our team. Any of our first 7 players can have a good game and throw down all star numbers.  But yeah, don’t be sleeping on Mike Conley or you’ll end up like the Grizzlies."
"Hated the jazz during the series but now I want them to go and win the title for small markets, team basketball, Mike Conley, and the regular season."
Hopefully mike Conley is healthy and ready for round two. Such a important piece
"Cry more lol.  There's an asterisk after every season if you want to play the excuse game.  People would have said bubble frauds about the Heat if they won, and they say Mickey Mouse chip about the Lakers.  Besides, I love Mike Conley but no one is going to say ""oh if only Mike Conley was 100%, we would have beaten Kawhi PG and the Clippers"".  The Clippers have owned the Suns in the games they've played, they have no one that can guard Kawhi either.  The Jazz are still really good though.  And lets not pretend like this game now is over..."
"kill donovan, fuck clarkson because you know that'd be fun, then marry mike conley cause wholesome.     Kill grayson allen, hate fuck brooks then dump him as rudely as possible, marry ja morant because I wanna be part of his awesome family."
"kill fuck marry  Jazz - Mike Conley, Donovan , Clarkson  Grizz - Ja Morant, Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen"
"Rudy Gobert won two DPOY awards and will win his third this year once it’s announced. Him, Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley all made the all-star team this year. Jordan Clarkson won 6th man of the year this year. Gobert and Mitchell are legit top tier players and now have multiple all star appearances. Mitchell has even won the dunk contest. Conley has been a great player for many years, but was always just barely pushed out of making the all star team. There are also some high level role players on the Jazz such as Bogdanovic and Ingles. In short, they have two (less famous due to small market) stars in Mitchell and Gobert matched with a deep roster filled great role players. I’m not exactly sure where I’d rank the two stars, but Gobert is probably the absolute best defensive presence in the league and Mitchell is a top 15 scorer."
[Mike Conley has right hamstring soreness and will not return](https://twitter.com/Tjonesonthenba/status/1400284609246425091)  Balls.
"They have a bunch of pretty good players. Rudy Gobert is going to lock up his third defensive player of the year this year, and Donovan Mitchell has been a very good scorer, he might have a top 10 ceiling. Beyond them, Mike Conley was a pretty good point guard for Memphis forever, and he's... still pretty good this year. Bojan is a good scorer too, and their last starter, Royce O'Neal, is a great three and d guy. Off the bench includes Clarkson and Ingles, who were top two in the six man of the year voting.  Basically, they all gel together super well, and are really deep. Their shooting and ball movement is tremendous, and Gobert locks down the paint."
"I'd say a little bit of both. Donovan Mitchell is really starting to come into his own (as you can see from that first half) and Mike Conley has been really good these last couple years as well. On the other hand, this is a team that has completely bought into, and works very well with, Quin Snyder's system to become a team that is truly more than the sum of its parts."
"Little bit of both I’d say. Their best players are Rudy gobert and Donovan Mitchell, who are both all starts but more in the top 15-20 range. Their supporting cast is also excellent, they have the 6moy Jordan Clarkson as well as mike Conley, a borderline all star player"
"Donovan Mitchell is only in his fourth season. Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley don't get the respect they deserve from the national media. I'm surprised you haven't heard of Donovan yet, he's a superstar.  That said, the strength of our team is our team, it's our chemistry that makes us this good"
"Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley and Rudy gobert aren't a bunch of nobodies"
Half of me wants to quit my stream and just watch Black Butler or play Among Us or Valorant. The other half wants me to keep watching for our guys. And also Mike Conley.
Mike Conley is the man
"""mike conley might be the most underrated player of his generation"""
Mike Conley is fucking disgusting
Rudy Gobert is irrelevant against a team with four lethal three point shooters and Mike Conley can’t hang with Kyrie or Harden.  It’s not about defending your p&amp;r. It’s about you not being able to score 140 or stop us from scoring 140.
I'll be rooting for Mike Conley only.
"…or Mike “grindhouse” Conley leaving the grizz for utah. Or gasol for Toronto, or Boogie for New Orleans. Huge names get traded or sign with all sorts of organizations at different points in their career for different reasons."
Steph is the greatest shooter of all time and makes one per twenty-two attempts. Mere excellent shooters like Mike Conley make one in 40. Melo is 0-45.
"&gt;Brook Lopez vs Nets matchup is confirmed. This, along with the ongoing Mike Conley vs Grizzlies series, marks the first time two franchise point leaders have faced their former team in the playoffs at the same time.  No way Lopez is ahead of Kidd, petrovic dr J wtf"
"KD on the grit n grind grizzlies would be fucking scary. They needed an iso scorer and my god KD would’ve made that team lethal.  Mike conley, Tony Allen, Kevin Durant, zach randolph, and Marc Gasol would have the #1 defense and prob still a top 10 or 5 offense"
His ceiling for me is a very good player but not a star. A mike Conley for me. He needs to improve his decision making and defense.
"Once the spurs get eliminated, I root for teams which have players that I like(there are exceptions). So rn, that's the suns(CP3)and jazz(Mike Conley)."
Devin Booker   Caruso has his number.    Mike Conley   Playoff Conley!! Best player on the Jazz right now.   Michael Porter Jr.   Kind of showing how limited he is when he isn't shooting at a super high level.   Ben Simmons   He's gonna be the reason they don't make it to the finals.
"- Devin Booker - needs to get sooo much better - Mike Conley - Elite point guard - Michael Porter Jr. - Solid - Ben Simmons - Very good, a jumpshot away from delivering the Sixers a Championship, but should've traded him for Harden"
"Mike Conley is probably the best offensive player on the jazz right now, especially when they go up against a more respected, experienced team next round and Mitchell can't draw the calls he can against us."
1. Kawhi Leonard 2. James Harden 3. Nikola Jokic 4. Damian Lillard 5. Luka Doncic 6. Kevin Durant 7. Trae Young 8. Joel Embiid 9. Giannis Antetokounmpo 10. Jayson Tatum 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Lebron James 13. Ja Morant 14. Mike Conley 15. Derrick Rose
Mike Conley
And Mike Conley has shot us in the fucking face
"Wow I can't believe Mike Conley said, ""Fuck Ja Morant and the clique he claim""."
"how dare the Grizz, who were a lottery team in their last season with Mike Conley, trade Mike Conley instead of running it back."
"When the trade happened it felt mutual. Conley just watched the Grizz trade Gasol to the Raptors who ended up winning the championship. It was also clear that the Grizzlies needed to go into rebuild mode. I'm fairly confident that Conley didn't want to be stuck on a rebuilding team during the last couple years of his prime when he could be a major piece on a contender, regardless of the love he had for the Grizzlies. I'm sure he would have been content staying on the Grizzlies, just like Gasol who said he was against being traded at first, but in the end it was best for both parties involved for Mike to move on."
Fuck yea dude those rebounds were so key. I think he’s also been the most consistent shooter on the team this series along with mike Conley
Draymond creating a narrative that doesn't exist. Mike Conley said that he loves Memphis and never spoke wrong about the Grizzlies organization
"Disagree heavily, guys like Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry are the most underrated impactful players of the last decade, Mike Conley and Jrue Holiday should be added to that group as well.   Everybody gets that LeBron is the best player without understanding *why* he's the best player. What is LeBron's best skill? It's his passing.   The players with elite basketball intelligence, which is often correlated with how good of a playmaker you are, is the most underappreciated skill in basketball. Contrary to popular belief, you can't really teach basketball IQ, that intrinsic feel for the game that playmakers like LeBron, Luka, Jokic, Trae, CP3, Harden etc. have, you kinda either have it or you don't."
Does Mike Conley not being able to score actively hinder your offense by allowing defenders to a) hack a Conley or b) straight up leave Conley open to double another player
"This point only works if we ignore that Mike Conley is a 41% 3 pt shooter,  even if he doesn't score he still has to be honored on the floor at all times which allows the Jazz to play 5 out. The same can't be said for Ben simmons because if he's standing anywhere other than 5-12 feet from the basket his defender can sag off of him. Yes I agree scoring(pt totals) aren't everything but a player like Simmons in today's game makes roster construction tricky.   It's the same reason Draymond who i compare Simmons too gets so much flak from warriors fans even though simmons is a better scorer at this point in their careers. Yes you can win games with both and your team can be elite but it makes things more difficult imo"
Mike Conley kinda always been that way tbh
"Mike Conley scored 11 tonight. He also won the game for us, again. Scoring isn’t everything"
i would join any religion mike conley told me to
mike conley ready to start a commune and practicing Buddhism real quick
mike conley giving home economics substitute teacher vibes
*jazz legend mike conley
Mike Conley only had like 11pts 7 ast tonight but had a huge impact. You can depend on him to control the flow of the game and find others. I think thats what fans are asking for
"We would have to give Mike Conley back, legally."
should've interviewed Mike Conley smh
"Mike ""The Villain"" Conley"
Mike Conley is the difference maker for us
jazz legend mike conley
Mike Conley is the only thing between us and a sweep of the Jazz. Fml
Ayye dope for Mike Conley
Grizz fans. How does it feel to see Mike Conley pick Ja's pocket then nail the 3?
"Mike ""Villain"" Conley"
Idk why you’re being downvoted. He literally head butted Mike Conley.
MIKE FUCKING CONLEY SHEESH
Imagine being so salty that you'd even want Mike Conley to not succeed.
Remember when Jazz and Grizzlies fans got along because of Mike Conley? LOL
Dude literally punched Mike Conley last game. Fuck that dude.
"I love mike Conley but the pieces involved in getting him (jae crowder, Grayson Allen, two late firsts) all worked out and are still good/development pieces.   Happy to see success with these guys"
"Was Mike Conley the one who said earlier this week, he’s the villain because Memphis is now cheering for the upcoming star Ja Morant and he feels left out?  Maybe if you fucking made an All Star appearance in your time there, you would have more homecoming cheers?  Shit."
My thing is idc who wins really but it frustrates me to see Mike Conley going over screens against a guy who can’t shoot just makes no sense and bothers me for some reason 😂 it’s like going over a screen against Westbrook
Seriously why is Mike Conley guarding Ja why isn’t Royce on him and them going under on screens and make Ja shoot he can’t hit it consistently yet and Mike Conley is going over or dying on screens and letting Ja get down hill just makes no sense
Damn Mike Conley back on the Grizz
Mike Conley said the F word gasp
"Mike Conley saying ""The Fuck?"" is jarring lol"
Just randomly thought of that Mike Conley quote from the other day and honestly I'm offended that he thought he could ever be portrayed as a villain in Memphis smh
Mike Conley wouldn’t hit a last shot game 7 and that’s a fact
Is it just me or does Mike Conley look like Mario?
Boo Mike Conley.  Memphis would never lol
Mike Conley. He's already said he wants to resign with Utah. I hope he stays!
"Mike Conley will be up there, though hopefully he just re-signs with Utah."
"Mike Conley was generally considered better, even has 1 ASG now  Meanwhile Kenny is sitting there telling stories about the time he almost made an ASG"
"Mike Conley! Wait, he is an all star now!"
"A lot better. The biggest difference is that mike Conley is actually good this year. It took him a season to acclimate to our system, but once he did it totally unlocked what this team can become"
No that’s disrespectful to kenny. Patty mills has never averaged more than 11 points. He’s more like mike Conley
"Something impactful? Smart and Brown both had very insightful articles last season that provocked actual discussion same with plenty of other players, Marcus Rashford has like a dozen different charities, Mike Conley did so much shit for Memphis.  Kyrie calling Boston some racist shithole in an interview during a playoff series does none of that. If he wanted to he has the power to reach people and spread an actual message"
Yeah bro straight up. I think it was game 4? Or game 5? Kawhi had 43 and scored 16 straight points and they still lost because of the mike Conley game winner or Marc gasol.
"i know his role is very different from everyone else on this list and his boxscore like usual isn't super impressive next to some of these, but i feel rudy gobert deserves some attention, especially because of the dumb narrative that some people have about him getting played off the court in the playoffs. he's absolutely been utah's best player so far, even with how good mike conley has been  15.7pts, 14reb, 3.7blks 77ts%, 87efg% +/- of +32"
I have never seen Mike Conley complain to refs. Im pretty sure he did at some point but it’s damn rare.
I see you're just looking at numbers. If you truly think Bogdan Bogdanovic provides the same value as Mike Conley then it's pointless to debate
Replace him with Wiggins those two years and they still win.  Replace Curry with Mike Conley and they don't.
"That's no surprise. He's on the third axis of transcendence right now. Chris Paul moves in anti-planar reality (or prime-planar reality, shouts to my qmech nerds who really buy Frisch-Hayes.) While guards like Mike Conley or Jrue Holiday see the game from an x and o perspective, Chris has vision of the omega and delta factors surrounding any given basketball event. There's a reason Chris was able to knock out LeBron James in the 2021 playoffs. Put simply, Chris Paul is visuospatial jazz. Think of Ornette Coleman or George St. Breux, not Ben Simmons or PatBev. The dorian stylings of a Eric Dolphy better describe Chris Paul's game than a monotone listing-off of conventional basketball skills. Ball handles? When you're in constant tune with the precise Hz pitch of the hardwood like CP3, English words like ""good handles"" cannot encapsulate even a fractoid of the scientific and metaphysical majesty of Christopher."
Hi Aturo! My favorite player of all time is David Lee and my favorite current player is Mike Conley.
**KYRIE SHAKING IN HIS SANDALS**  **MIKE CONLEY RETIRING**  **BEVERLY/RONDO FAKING INJURIES**
"Oh, shut up, homers. Your delusional asses are denying that Mike Conley is injury-prone too? Cry me a river."
Are you comparing the loss of Ibaka to Mike Conley?
Mike Conley aint playing
Mike Conley and Mitchell going to absolutely abuse DMC in that PnR
"I was sad when the Jazz missed on Kemba (active rumors for a while that we were trying) and got Mike Conley instead.  Now Mike's been amazing, beats Kemba in just about every stat except PPG and does it on higher efficiency and less usage. And he's 3 years older.  I don't think Kemba is toast--I've seen him do too many amazing things. But it's definitely not working out in Boston."
"Did you watch the game? The Jazz missed like 21 straight shots in the first quarter, and were without Mike Conley."
"I'd say Conley. In his era, Miller's lack of outside shooting was starting to be a bit of a problem towards the end there. He'd be a miniature Ben Simmons today, without the other gifts. I do think he and Hot Rod are mad underrated. Brandan and Conley is close. But I think Mike has more intangibles."
the jazz didnt have mike conley they probably will the rest of the way
"Terrell Brandon, Mike Conley and then Andre Miller in that order."
"Disappointed...that felt like the Clippers game to take given how poorly Utah played in the first half and no Mike Conley.  Ultimately think the series is far from over, but the biggest X faxtor has to be the play of Paul George. If he's just as good as he was that Dallas series, I think we have the upper hand. If he continues to shoot as poorly as he did yesterday, we have no chance.  I've seen alot of talk about how PG and Kawhi have struggled against Utah throughout the regular season the previous 2 years...but Kawhi was playing like the best player in the world round 1 and think he can turn it on this series...honestly was likely mentally fatigued from game 7 more than anything as he never really turned it on last night.  Ty Lue was great with adjustments round 1 so Im excited to see what happens tomorrow.  The stars have to show up regardless though."
"50 passes per game list looks like pretty good company. ""PTs created"", pushes Ben up the rankings. What makes you think assist to pass percentage a good metric? 3 of the top 4 players by that metric are score first guards that dump the ball off when double teamed. James Harden gets ranked 10th by that sorting. It seems more indicative of play style than ""goodness"".    Trae Young  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Luka Doncic  Chris Paul  Mike Conley  Ja Morant  James Harden  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  LeBron James  Marcus Smart  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Derrick Rose  Tobias Harris  Nikola Jokic  Dennis Schroder  Royce O'Neale"
2021 all star Mike Conley is an all star.
"I think both teams have a ton of room for improvement, but Mike Conley playing is a bigger improvement than anything the Clippers have in their back pocket."
2021 Mike Conley an all star caliber player?
I had the Clippers as favorites in this game. They were in a good rhythm. They had just won 2 decisive games. And Utah had a long pause and were missing Mike Conley. This sometimes lead to the rested team to lose the game because they start slow and their opponents go full throttle from the first minute. It happened in this game but Utah was able to recover.
"Seriously, worst 1st quarter ever, no Mike Conley, definitely our best basketball"
And were missing noted Clipper killer Mike Conley.
Jazz are also missing Mike Conley if he gets healthy enough to come back they should be better.
"Draymond should stick to his day job, which is riding Steph, Klay, and KD's coattails to championships.  Is he aware that Mike Conley was out and the Jazz missed 21 consecutive shots?  Outside of Mitchell, the othe typical leaders of Utah did not play great.  Utah will come out guns blazing in game 2 and go up 2-0...bookmark this post."
Without Mike Conley.
"This.  Also, shit, a large part of the Clips strategy this series has to be believing Kawhi / PG can contain Donny.  Didn't happen in game 1, and soon they'll have to deal with Mike Conley too.    This result absolutely has the Jazz feeling better about the rest of the series than the Clips."
"Jazz missed 21 consecutive shots in a row in the first, were down an All Star in Mike Conley their second shot creator, and won and yet clipps should walk away with their head high?"
"we did it tonight with no Conley and the refs feeding them calls down the stretch on top of a bad shooting night. if Mike is back, i take us in 5-6 or so"
do you really gonna dismiss mike conley tho?  you forgot 2017 nba playoffs mike conley. put some respect on his name.
If you don’t think Mike Conley is an all star point guard you haven’t watched the Jazz play all season. Dude is a difference maker and has played the best basketball of his career this season. He was named an all star for a reason.
Mike Conley plays like a superstar point guard against the Clippers though.
"lol it's funny when people say stuff like ""without their all-star point guard"" because they know that sounds more impressive than mike conley"
"was pretty even   - both teams shot shit from 2P saved by 3s  - Jazz missed having Mike Conley; Clips missed having Paul George 😂  think it’ll come down to either if Conley or PG can show up, or who wins between Donovan and Kawhi  my biggest worry is Kawhi getting tired… Donovon looked flawless by halftime"
"Says the same fans who says ""Wahhh Mike Conley is out"" and ""oh the officiating"" and ""wahhh we missed shots the 4th quarter""  It's called discussion of a game ya dingus  It's just fans analyzing what contributed to the loss/win and talking shit"
And no Mike Conley
Dont forget Mike Conley is coming back
"No Mike Conley tonight, pretty damn rough first half, but we still pulled out the W. I'm pretty happy about that.  Are *you* happy, Clippers fan?"
"Clippers fans, y'all realize mike conley is out right? Series over in 5"
Missing Mike Conley and having our worst shooting half of the season in the first half.   Pretty fucking happy as a Jazz fan here
Lmao utah is missing mike conley and came back from 20. But okay.
And mike Conley didnt play
Clipps fans haven’t figured out a win without all star mike conley and terrible 1st half shooting isn’t good news
"clippers had their true mvp luke kennard playing, jazz were missing mike conley."
they are also missing mike conley bro...........
How did Mike Conley only get all star this season? He's been so good for so long.
The Clippers really lost on purpose just to get taken to 7 gamea by Luka and the corpse of Tingis Pingis and then lose Game 1 to the Jazz without Mike Conley
This is without Mike Conley.
Mike Conley ain't coming back until we lose. 🙇‍♂️
Mike Conley is my favorite non Celtic so I’ve watched probably 20+ of the games this year but the crowd at this game has gone ever the top
WITHOUT MIKE CONLEY
"Man if the Jazz are playing THIS well without Mike Conley, imagine what's going to happen when he's back. Oh boy."
Can somebody tell me what happened to Mike Conley and how long he is projected to be out for?
"&gt; they have no one to consistently break down the defense against those Clipper wings  Lol so Mike Conley is dead, apparently"
"Welcome to ""Jazz without Mike Conley"""
"Lol yes, Serge Ibaka is an equal contributor to Mike Conley."
I knew Mike Conley was out tonight but I didn't know Donovan Mitchell was gonna be missing too.
It sounds like you know a little something about Mike Conley
Jazz are a totally different team with Mike Conley
Mike Conley is supposed to be entertaining to watch now?
Just been missing open threes. Missing mike conley badly though
"Mike Conley is the glue to this Jazz team, they operate completely different without him."
"Mike Conley was way more valuable vs the Jazz than Donavan was, though"
"The absolute bullshit that the Jazz are so fucking poor at 3 point shooting after they straight laced us last series pisses me the fuck off, and I'm trying to root Mike Conley to a chip."
it’s like 7 minutes into game 1 there missing mike Conley and are down by 9 chill
Props to Mike Conley sitting out this one for Ingles can start against his son. This teams so fucking wholesome
"Clippers would have Kawhi/Luka so probably the two best players on the floor.  Utah would then have Donovan and Gobert  Clippers would have Paul George  Name a single Clipper who is better than the following list of players  Ja Morant  Mike Conley  Bojan Bogdanovic  Joe Ingles  Jeremy Clarkson  Derrick Favors  Royce O'Neale  Maybe the Clippers 4th best player is as good as Royce, but Utah would be WAAAAAAAY deeper.  It's not bias, its just Utah has a deeper squad and we'd be adding Ja in the mix in this hypothetical."
"Mike Conley had the biggest contract ever at one point. Granted, it was fully deserved"
You think a backcourt of Ja and Mitchell with Mike Conley now coming off the bench with the 6th man of the year and runner up 6th man of the year would get SWEPT by the Luka Clippers?  Duuuuuuuuude.
"I'm not taking it away from KD? I'm saying he was great. I'm providing context to your stat that tried to imply KD was to the Warriors' defense what TD was to the Spurs.   Having a good positional defender in your system is dope, but the guy anchoring your defense, calling out coverages, being the general out there is more important. It's like how Marc Gasol was that dude, even though Tony Allen was elite at his spot, and Mike Conley to a lesser extent."
"Conley and Evans were both on the Grizz one year and I gotta say, they ain't that alike. Evans was in attack mode way more often - he wanted to dive at the rim and look for contact. Mike was more confident in his shot and floater, and way WAY better at orchestrating an offense. Tyreke's issue, at least that year, was that he was very reliant on just muscling through smaller guards to score. I'm confident that is why his rookie year he was so good and never hit that level again - he is a one trick pony. When teams put bigger defenders on him or tried to seal off the paint, he was only an okay passer (good for a 6'6 wing but not good enough to be a full time PG) and outside of his year in Memphis his jumper was unreliable. Conley was way more tricks up his sleeve and a better command over the pace of the game.   And that all doesn't even consider defense."
&gt;Mike Conley still lives with Kawhi nightmares.
"If this is a 55/45 Jazz favor or even 60/40 with mike Conley, no mike Conley sways this to - at the least - even or 45/55 jazz favor.  Certainly not saying the Jazz will shrivel without him but Conley is one less all star, and from a game planning point of view, he provides a  second 3 level scorer the clipps have to deal with instead of just Mitchell; and defensively he’s the next best 1v1 defender to handle switches after oneale. It’s a big difference against a good clipps squad"
Mike Conley still lives in my nightmares. This is huge
"there are players way less mobile than harden with worse shooting, worse court vision and worse handles that still are valuable in the league. take mike conley for example. the only thing he is better at than a way less athletic harden is perimeter defense. and he ist an important piece for a contender. or kyle lowry. or patty mills. or maybe even chris paul.   if giannis loses most of his athleticism he is definetly worse than blake griffin currently. worse shooting, worse handles, worse playmaking"
1. Drose and CP3 tied 2. Lillard 3. Mike Conley 4. Millsap 5. Hardon 6. Westbrick 7. PG13 8. Melo 9. Redick 10. Cousins 11. Bertans
Damian Lillard  Carmelo Anthony  Chris Paul  Russell Westbrook   James Harden  Mike Conley  J.J. Redick  Derrick Rose  Paul George  Lou Williams   Paul Milsap  Demarcus Cousins
Im sure the blazers would love a 33 year old mike conley.
"its really up to conley's hamstring  1 game isnt worth having our all-star PG out for the rest of the post season.   The realistic possibilities are this:  Conley is 100%, he plays, we take whatever we get.  Conley is less than 100%, he plays, we win. Good outcome as long as he doesn't restrain the hammy.  Conley is less than 100%, he plays, we lose. Bad outcome on all accounts; Conley didnt get the extra rest and we still lost  Conley is less than 100%, he doesn't play, we win. Fantastic outcome. Rest for conley, and a Jazz win. Outside of Conley being 100% healthy this is the best outcome clearly.  Conley is less than 100%, he doesn't play, we lose. We've lost but at least Conley's hamstring got a rest and didn't get reaggravated. We live to fight another day, hopefully with a full strengh lineup   Which of these pathways is best depends completely on how mike feels. But if hes not 100% it seems like resting him is not the worst thing in the world."
jrue holiday is just so solid. him and mike conley seem similar to me. can’t really think of any other point guards who fit that ‘type’ idk
"Hopefully, the Jazz find a more reliable point guard in place of Mike Conley because it really is annoying that his hamstring issues keep popping up, especially at the worst times."
Okay. I’m obviously an idiot because that shit *still* doesn’t make sense to how it relates to the 2021 Phoenix Suns.  Is Deandre Ayton going to body Mike Conley into the scorers table in game 6 of the WCF?
"Utah is the only team in the league with a top 5 offense and defense, so I think they for sure have the right mix.   This series comes down to four main things for me:  1) How healthy is Mike Conley? His hamstring caused him a lot of trouble this season and if he misses significant time it's a big loss.  2) How close can Mitchell's output come to Kawhis? Mitchell has played like a superstar in past playoffs, if he can even stay in Kawhis ballpark production wise it's gonna be very hard for the Clippers as I think it's clear Utah has more talent after the top 2. These last two years Kawhi has really struggled against Utah, well see if that continues.  3) How much can the Clippers small ball lineup limit Goberts defensive impact? He won't get played off the court like some will claim, but if the Clippers want to win this series they will need to reduce Goberts defensive impact, to at least some degree. If he matches or exceeds his regular season impact I can't see the Clippers winning this one.  4) Can Goberts offense keep the Clippers honest defensively? Gobert gives Utah a big advantage downlow, if he can exploit that on offense it should open open up the three point shot for Utah.  If both teams are healthy I lean to Utah being the better team, with the better home court advantage. I give them about a 70% chance of advancing."
"The point was, his height isn’t uncommon for most guards right now. I forgot to mention Jrue holiday(6’3) and Mike Conley (6’1)"
"Mike Conley by far, also Bogdanovic."
"Lmao way to make it sound like your narrative is the reason we lost. Definitely not because the other team was just better. Those teams didn't have Mike Conley, Bojan or Jordan Clarkson either."
"Yes, I do. I think he's going to match up well against Mike Conley and try to make it difficult for him."
I think they were saying Mike Conley AFTER Kawhi because the topic was about the 2nd most impactful and Kawhi was already the 1st.
How is Mike Conley more well rounded than Kawhi
"Than why has Gobert made all-nba 3 times if he’s not a true all-star? Mike Conley averaged 17 pts and 9 assists vs the Grizzlies. Why are you comparing Dame to Mitchell, if Mitchell gets trapped he has 3 other guys around him who will knock down 3’s, Dame doesn’t have that luxury. You sound like someone who is talking out of their ass and doesn’t actually watch the Jazz at all."
"I know Conley missed one game in the matchup, but it may have been the game where Kawhi and Paul George sat. I vaguely recall hearing a stat that pointed to Mike Conley being one of the best players in the league on switches this season. The eye test kind of points to it for the reasons you mentioned. However, if the Clippers can force the Jazz to play isolation ball instead of pick and roll, then the Jazz are in trouble."
Mike Conley
The worst thing about the Clippers advancing for me is that the Jazz or the Clippers will be eliminated in the next round. I want Mike Conley or the Clippers/PG to win a ring :(
Pls get healthy Mike Conley
"You are right. He was the best player on the Pacers, they were like that grind Memphis team. So you could say he was like Mike Conley in Memphis. I think that's fair comparison."
Raptor has Mike Conley as a top 5 player. Just stop.
Mike Conley is a free agent.  On that note I'd very much appreciate it if you could all stay the fuck away from Mike Conley.
Player: Mike Conley - a great guy  Team: Jazz - one of the best winning record % franchises in their entire time in the NBA but haven't quite got over the hump (thanks MJ!)  They are also a team built via the draft and have cultivated a great team culture and they also have Joe Ingles
"There's no way around it except raising the max salary. If players like Dame, LeBron, Kawhi, Harden, KD are gonna get paid the same as Mike Conley, John Wall and Kemba Walker, you bet your ass they're gonna get theirs in some other way."
1. Royce O'Neale 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Mike Conley 4. Nikola Jokic 5. Derrick Favors
Thank you Kawhi and Reggie for giving Mike Conley some extra rest.
"Why not just make a prediction with some uncertainty? That’s why it’s a prediction, nobody knows. But you can still contextualize injury stuff based on the past, like we know guys like AD, Mike Conley, and Chris Paul aren’t the most durable so maybe that changes your predictions a little"
Further support for my theory that Jrue Holiday and Mike Conley are the same person
mike conley is 0-3 and has seriously impacted this game. forcing rotations and fortifying the bench/non rudy minutes
I want the Clippers to win but I don't want one of favorite player ever Mike Conley to lose. Wish he just sat this one out :(
"BREAKING: The Jazz have been eliminated from playoff contention, but in an unprecedented move by the NBA, Mike Conley will be allowed to continue with any team he chooses."
So glad Mike Conley is back tonight. Let’s go Jazz!!! 🎶🎶🎶
Clippers killer Mike Conley
Getting that Mike Conley treatment
"Oh a Mike Conley package, how could we even say no to that?"
Do you even have to ask? What are you trying to rob us? We give you Mike Conley and you try to rob us with “Damian Lillard”? 🤨
Mike Conley for Dame.... do we need to send some picks too?
"I think Utah could tonight because their players aren't ruled out yet. Mike Conley hopefully being back tonight would open up Mitchell to be effective even with his ankle.  Also, Gobert would actually be a threat on offense with Conley in."
"I've kept saying if we can just Mike Conley back in to help out it's smooth sailing, then Kawhi gets hurt and we suddenly play even worse, I'm afraid it might not matter. We are still losing against a hampered underdog team it's kind of embarrassing."
"One doesn't underperform on defense, defense is all effort (and IQ). However, because Conley is out, Gobert is less engaged on offense, and potentially less engaged on defense as a result (but I haven't seen this to be the case).  Gobert's defensive impact is significant. If it was any other center playing in place of Gobert, Kawhi and Paul George would demolish the paint and they'd have 4-0ed the Jazz.  Gobert's defense allows the Jazz perimeter players (who aren't the quickest or best defenders) to shade offensive players towards him. Of course, this is something that can be gameplanned against. The Clippers execution in the half court is extremely methodical and patient. Even though they can break down the Gobert defense, it's not like they're absolutely torching it.   A considerable bulk of the Jazz issues are on offense, as Mike Conley is out and Mitchell is incapable of commanding a half court offense, and the schemes are limited, especially if you consider the fact that Mitchell doesn't have any actions run for him off the ball."
"Typically if you go down 3-2, your odds of winning are very low. Also with Mike Conley out and Mitchell hobbled, the clippers have solved the jazz offense."
"This legit isn’t our offense, with the whole team just spot up shooting. We generally use Conley and Mitchell to penetrate and then kick out and click pass to get an open 3. Right now it’s just pull ups or one pass then a contested 3 bc we don’t have mike or spida threatening the rim or pnr inside.   Clippers can just defend high up on arc and we have no athletic players to take em off the dribble :/"
Somehow ibaka is= to all star mike Conley so the clippers actually didnt get spoonfed a win
"Yeah but does he elevate a team like even capella or nurkic does? Kyle korver was an allstar lol. And mike Conley just barely has one allstar. Allstar selections don’t equate value or performance.  So I’m terms of helping teams win, a non-shooting pg that can’t even really score or even shoot free throws is as valuable is capella. But he should be a modern center anyway."
"Mike Conley has been out the whole series, what series did they lose that they were really supposed to win?"
"Yup, requested a trade to the Jazz and ended up replacing Mike Conley in the starting lineup as a low 60-something rated rookie."
"Mike Conley I think normally plays left handed even though he writes right handed, and toward his last few seasons with the Grizz developed his right handed floater to match his left."
"Yeah, this is what happened for me. I had the option to sim to the beginning of the NBA season, but I played through the college stuff and had a few teams that were interested in me that I could choose from. I picked the Pacers, but I didn't see anywhere that I could change which team I picked as my priority right before the draft happened when my stock was a lot higher. So I got drafted by the Pacers and then as soon as I made the starting lineup I requested a trade to Utah and apparently bumped Mike Conley to the bench with my rating at like 60 something, lol."
"1-handed or 1-footed (in your case) dominant players definitely would have an easier time to be effective if they were more ambidextrous. However, sometimes this limitation makes you extremely crafty with just that one hand. Being extremely 1-handed can help in that you know when you get can your shot off effectively vs. not.   Some quick examples (not to flame), Westbrook thinks he's good at using his left hand finishing around the rim, but he's probably not that good at it bc he goes so fast. I've also seen Mike Conley use his right hand for floaters a little too liberally. Then you have someone like Tony Parker, who used the same set of moves, but with much higher effectiveness.     Bottom line, it's not necessarily the skill that you have, but it's how you use it."
"That's a fair point but, at the same time, it diminishes who Mike Conley is and has performed at especially during the playoffs when comparing impact with Donte.  Not to say it's not a loss or injury but a lot of other teams have had really major losses to their stars/all-stars."
Just so everyone knows. Favors is the one that Kawhi absolutely murdered on a poster. There is no argument to keep that man in there over Gobert. Yeah Gobert vs the small ball is rough but if you’re the Jazz you need Gobert to matchup against someone like Terrance Mann. Let him shoot it. Mann is the kinda guy you live and die by his shot. Not all the criticism should be on Snyder though; Gobert made some bad rotations last night that I saw where he basically left the paint wide open to guard the 3 ball. No matter what he needs to stay there. PG put up a majority of his points in the paint. You stop him there and maybe it’s a different game. Mike Conley coming back will help Goberts offensive game because if we are being honest Mitchel is a great offensive talent but he’s looking for his shot first. Conley is going to get everyone involved and mainly Gobert.
"I'm not denying Donte's impacting is being missed. I'm pointing out that his injury is way less jarring in terms of costing a team a championship than like Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, and Mike Conley"
"People were talking so much about Chris Bosh, Tony Parker and Mike Conley being underrated that eventually they became overrated"
"Fair enough, I will however die on the hill that Mike Conley is a solid (at best above-solid) starter. In Mitchell’s case, it seems like anyone can put up big numbers and look good. He’s been blessed to be part of a well-oiled machine that he certainly plays a significant role in. He had a crazy series last year in the bubble where it looked like *anyone* could go off (see: TJ Warren) and this shortened season was taken advantage of and the Jazz did great as a team to earn their place on the totem pole. This post season we’ve seen a lot of highs and lows from Mitchell so I’ve yet to see consistent greatness from him, the same kind that he sees in himself and many others do as well. In a few years I can see him being the player he thinks he is, but that will come with experience and age."
"It is the playoffs matchups are critical in series, and Clippers offense is good enough to make Jazz defense less effective. Donavon Mitchell ankle still have issues, so he is less effective as bail out offense if 3 pt are not hitting for the team. Jazz miss Mike Conley as the 2nd creator for their offense to be versatile. Royce O Neale their only good wing defender was in foul trouble which put Gobert in tough situations."
"&gt; Traded Grayson Allen, Darius Bazley, Jae Crowder, Kyle Korver and a 2020 1st round draft pick to the Memphis Grizzlies for Mike Conley. (1-7 and 15-30 protected)  So a 2018 first round pick, a 2019 first round pick, an elite role player, and an aging vet, and a protected 1st.  Not exactly sure how Thybulle, Maxey, salary filler, and a 1st is far off from Conleys trade value."
Lowrys value is closer to what Memphis got for Mike Conley. But Toronto wanted a bigger haul than what New Orleans got for Jrue  Make it make sense
"Glad this wasnt asked a couple years ago. Between Mike Conley and Dillon Brooks, I think the Grizzlies didnt draft a player that they re-signed. Most werent good enough to get a second contract with *anyone*. But there were a couple (DeMarre Carroll, Greiveis, maybe another 1 or 2) that they traded or released that found homes elsewhere."
"That speaks to the poor construction of the current team more than anything. The lack of playmakers like LeBron or CP3 seriously hurts the ability of the team to find better shots.  Edit: LeBron and Paul are old, so I understand them sitting out, but why did no one ask Mike Conley to play?"
"All season I heard people talk about how people shouldn't sleep on the Jazz and that Rudy Gobert is one of the best defensive players in history and y'all blow like a 26 point lead as a first seed with the best defense in the league supposedly with D-Mitch on fire to Terrance fucking Mann and Reggie Jackson.   I don't care if Mike Conley was hurt, choking like that is unacceptable for any contender and a first seed"
"Ja, Shai, MPJ, Fox, bit it'll be tough because guard is so stacked in the West.  Mike Conley would probably be a 5 time all star if he had been in the East."
Kemba Walker and Mike Conley! What is the consensus thought on Harden?
i don't really agree with this.  SGA is a borderline all-star probably should've gotten it over mike conley imo
So jazz reached their ceiling this year when they didn't have the #2 +/- player in the nba for pretty much the entire series. Don playing on one leg after game 2. And still had a good chance to win.. the disrespect to how good Mike Conley is for the jazz is sickening. Did you watch France vs USA? Did you see how Gobert when players actually hit him with proper passes was able to easily score? Clippers wouldn't of been able to blitz Don with a healthy Conley who would've eaten them up. And yes Conley is the main player who gets Gobert involved the floater alley oop that they have would've been spammed in the clippers series. I won't guarantee they end up winning but saying their ceiling is a 2nd round exit is ignorant.
would Ja Morant or Mike Conley have been enough? Not sure why they chose so many iso wings
"Mike Conley has a $40M cap hold on the Jazz, so it's either Schroder or Conley but not both"
Mike Conley
I’d rather Jazz give Dennis his contract then resign Mike Conley because you don’t have to load manage Dennis. But I Know Jazz bringing Mike back to make us suffer.
"We got bailed out by Khris Middleton... I don't know how to explain this to you, but when you go from down 7 (a lead that increased when Trae went down), to up 11, in a matter of 6 minutes, solely because of one player in Middleton, there's no bigger reason you won.  Btw the Clippers, as great as they were, got lucky with Conley not being healthy, an all-star level player, and Gobert gets spoon fed, yes, but is damn good on converting when he is spoonfed points. Conley creates 10% of Gobert's points in the regular season (lmfao), Gobert relies HEAVILY (so does the Jazz offense) on Mike Conkley's playmaking, the Jazz basically had to play without 2 all-stars on the offensive side of the glass, and they still went up 2-0"
"Forget about 10, every single GM would trade Simmons immediately for 4 future #4 picks, some for even just 3. Much better players have been dealt for less, and those were first rounders not a guarantee of a 4 pick which is insane. I don’t think you realize how crazy valuable 4 #4 picks would be to any org, let alone 10.  Because if you’d done the work of going a decade before you’d realize that’s where Chris Paul, Chris Bosh, Russell Westbrook and Mike Conley were drafted. But you didn’t and it’s a good thing you’re not an actual GM. Yeah have a good one, done with this."
He would have got it this year in the west if he wasn’t injured. They got mike Conley in the Allstate game this year as a 2nd tier injury reserve.
damon stoudamire and mike conley   wes unseld and rick mahorn   charles oakley and yao ming   sam bowie and eddie jones   alton lister and jermaine o'neal
How is Donavan Mitchell at 18 too low. I don't think hes better than anyone else above except booker. Gobert is perfect at 26 but mike Conley should be higher.
"&gt;Looks ridiculous now that he was picked before Durant  It looks ridiculous now that he was picked above his high school teammate Mike Conley Jr now. But, that's kind of the point of billing kids as the next big thing, you can never know. Sports media does it because they ratings when they do it, and then even more when most of them don't live up to the hype."
**Utah Jazz**: Mike Conley Jr
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
"He's said his fair share of controversial things. Mike Conley, Kemba, Jokic are all candidates."
"Westbrook far above anyone else. He cares too much not to have one. Besides him, Ricky Rubio, Mike Conley, Joe Ingles for obvious reasons, Wes Matthews."
Mike Conley  Klay Thompson  Giannis  Tacko  Boban  Spacing would be horrible in the front court but defense would be solid.
"Oh man, I can name a few from the 2013-2019 dark years:  - Larry Nance Jr. making his own basket against the Clippers on Christmas 2015  - Robert Sacre inbounding it to fucking Jae Crowder and then fouling him as he makes the layup in a game in Dallas.  - D'Angelo Russell with that blunder on the fastbreak with Jordan Clarkson. Kobe then rolls his eyes afterwards lmao.  - Marcelo Huertas (the GOAT) and his backwards shot against the Heat.  - Jeremy Lin not fouling Mike Conley in crunch time while Kobe is yelling at him to foul so Kobe has to run up and do it himself.  - Lonzo passing up a wide open layup he could have got on the fastbreak and instead tries to pass it back to Javale McGee (who was behind him) but turns it over instead.  - LeBron not dribbling the ball to start the clock against the Nuggets and instead the ball just rolls out of bounds."
"Abyssmal take. Suns only made it cause injuries is bad enough, but Chris Paul = Mike Conley? Fuck outta here. Idgaf if you give him credit or not, CP3 made the finals and was a huge reason his team did so."
"I can't give Chris Paul all that credit. He had a great season and definitely deserved to finish in the 4-7 range in MVP voting, but we're basically nullifying all the other factors involved.  The Suns core was naturally going to progress to a playoff spot, and I think it's fair to say that the only reason they even made the Finals (for the first time in 30 years) is because every other title contending team in the West (Lakers, Clippers, Nuggets, Jazz) had serious injuries to their #1 or #2 option. I hate to discredit the Suns but I think it's disingenuous to claim this was CP3's best season ever and that he carried the Suns to the Finals.  If they had traded for a point guard in the next caliber down (e.g. Mike Conley or Kyle Lowry) instead of Chris Paul, assuming everything else is the same, do they make the Finals? I'm not sure."
"Being a Jazz fan this season has been nothing but pain. Almost nobody took us seriously, we got clowned on by Shaq, LeBron and KD, injuries, another racist fan incident, and we once again lost in the second round to Terrance Mann who decided to kill us one last time this season. Fucking Pain. I’m sure I’m missing some stuff but I think I just don’t care to remember it. We had a lot of good things too, like Rudy getting DPOY and Clarkson getting 6MOTY and of course Mike Conley finally getting an All-Star. But those things probably won’t be remembered as much."
"Lmao you dumb as hell dawg  Every team they played missed their starting PG except for the Cavs that had kyrie for game 1 until he broke his kneecap in over time   First round they played Pelicans without their starting PG, jrue holiday  Second the played Memphis without their starting PG, mike Conley, also missing tony Allen  Third they played Houston without their starting PG, pat bev  And in the finals they played cavs without their starting PG, kyrie, from game two and forward. And Kevin love also out  Damn I bet you feel dumb   It wasn’t even that long ago…wtf"
"Royce O'Neale, Mike Conley, and Paul George"
For a couple years ya he was I'd say 2014-2018 when they got rid of rudy gay and zbo was kind of aging out he averaged 17ppg on that period mike Conley also averaged 17 ppg but gasol averaged slightly more shots
"Wayy wayyyy too soon to say that Kira can't shoot yet, the man barely played in his rookie year and even if he had, rookie year shooting splits are no guarantee of future shooting ability, see DeAaron Fox, Mike Conley, Kemba Walker etc. Point guards take awhile to develop and that man has speed to burn, so he just needs his jumper to become passable and that man will be extremely hard to stop in the future.   As for NAW, he can create his own shot against most guys in the league and has had a couple of 30 point games in his career, which is impressive for somebody who is still just 22. I think he projects as more of a 6th man than a starter going forward though, but as a starter, I like the idea of having some guard shot creators to run PnR with Zion. The Ingram/Zion PnR is easily switchable."
Mike Conley
Mike Conley villain arc? I cant even imagine
"Tell that to the other guy replying to me that has written at least 4,000 words about a fictional scenario involving Mike Conley being a zen master, and also I'm -25. If we were all joking I'd be upvoted cause that picture is hilarious lmao"
"I mean, you are incredibly annoying, but I'm not *that* upset, mostly just confused as to why you can't take a joke or like have a convo without dunking on yourself for no reason. Again, I'm not even sure why you're so mad at me, all I said was that I think it's very funny that Dillon Brooks and Mike Conley are interacting with each other they way they are and you just won't stop doing the literal cope face of posting crying laughing emojis and saying ""man you're writing so much you're so mad and corny, I'm so *not* mad that I don't even care to be invested"" while replying to multiple comments in a comment chain like 10 feet deep. Like man, just own it, own the fact that you're mad and want to banter and troll a bit, what is the point of acting like you don't care when you're replying to me like five minutes after I send something. It just doesn't make sense.  And again, it's just kinda... pathetic? Because I genuinely feel like you'd be a better troll if you were either doing a better job of pretending you don't care or actually, idk, saying something creatively insulting. You're just kinda stuck in no man's land of looking really mad but also not actually getting any good jabs in or anything. Just repeating my joke isn't even an insult, it just makes you look silly? Take some time to actually think of something a little funnier instead of just replying immediately with a reply that's just ""I'm not mad, actually you're mad"" because again, it just feels like cope instead of something fun."
Mike Conley.   PJ Tucker.

Mike “Dark knight” Conley
The only animosity I've *ever* seen towards Mike Conley is fans of other players being upset he got the All-Star nod this year.
I know what you mean. It just took a few minutes of game one to remind me how good Mike Conley is.
"No one is going to believe me, but I have a friend whose brother's coworker briefly dated Mike Conley. She said that on their first date they went to a restaurant and Conley ordered two different bowls of soup and mixed them together one spoonful at a time before eating both bowls mixed together as one soup"
I like Mike Conley alot. Nothing but respect for him.
How can you ever hate Mike Conley though?
Mike Conley to go 0/20 in game 4.
"You either die a hero, or become Mike Conley"
"You do see you are explaining mike Conley to a grizzlies fan right? Okay, just making sure..."
"Mike Conley shot 2-13 in Game 7 and he was a -1 for the series, he had 2 good games and 3 bad games, and missed the first two, people are shitting on me, but I’m not that far off."

"Are you... okay? You linked an angle where I see the back of Mike's head as evidence that he was talking shit and I linked the video where they have a close up shot of him from the front that shows him saying nothing and just staring at him. Again, did you watch it or...?  I was being tongue in cheek when I said Mike was living rent free. Obviously he's at least a little annoyed or he wouldn't bother staring him down in the first place or jaw at him at half court, but I just find it really funny that you're saying ""haha, actually Brooks is in *your* head"" when the dude is barking and bumping up and down the court with Mike fucking Conley, who's definition of getting heated is [looking at you like he's concerned for your well being](https://i.imgur.com/1A4NKd1.png). Again, when they showed the replay I just thought it was really funny, and then to have you coming to argue about it in the comments just makes it worse. If you're point is that Jazz fans are the ones who are getting too worked up you're not doing a great job of proving your point, even though I'd probably agree lol"

The fact that fucking Mike Conley is talking shit to anyone should be evidence enough that Dillon is a pest. Idk why you're trying to act like something it's not, it's just two men talking shit"
He had Mike jawing at him the whole second half. Mike fucking Conley. You fire that man up you're def being an asshole
Please I need y’all to let this narrative die. Mike conley was his captain for two full years he gave him a soft bump to the chest and Mike barely responded lol
mike conley owns memphis 🤣 https://imgur.com/gallery/e3zWJKj
Mike Conley ain’t nice...   He SUPER NICE!
"i honestly just fucking love mike conley, mess with mike and i probably hate you. dillon messed with mike."
"If Mike Conley wasn't playing his best basketball in a Jazz uni there's a very real chance you guys are down 0-3. Anyone who says it isn't close hasn't been watching, these have been great games"
"If Chris Paul is the “point god”, is Mike Conley the “point demigod”?"
"DPOY, top two 6 men of the year, a superstar who can take over late in close games, well coached, best three point shooting team of all time, oh and throw in a rejuvenated Mike Conley, Bogdanovic, and a 31-5 home record where they'll have HCA all playoffs. This question is stupid."
Grizz are young and that definitely showed tonight. Mitchell still looks pretty rusty and playing into game shape. Saw him wince a couple times just bringing the ball down.   I appreciate Mike Conley showing no mercy to his former team and Morant trying to murder Gobert literally every play.
I want to like evil players like him but I'm gonna need him to stop head butting and throwing unnecessary shots at bae Mike Conley
I don't want to overreact but Mike Conley might be the greatest player of all time
Jazz legend Mountain Mike Conley
Mike Conley doing his old team dirty.
Mike Conley looks drunk.
Mike fucking Conley amirite?
Mike Conley wow
MIKE CONLEY WTF
Anytime Mike Conley is out
You are welcome for Mike Conley
Y’all remember that Mike Conley ball handling video?  That’s where I learned my first dribbling drills
If you really think Dillon is kidney punching his ex-teammate and all time likeable guy Mike Conley directly in front of the ref without Mike reacting I think you have problems
Now real NBA heads will remember Mike Conley once played for the Memphis Grizzlies
I loved Mike Conley then and I love Mike Conley now. I can’t help it.   I hope we never have to play against him in a playoff series again.
“Man fuck Mike Conley!” -said no one ever
"I was giving dude benefit of the doubt for hard nosed play, but choosing mike Conley to punch is weak."
"Dillon Brooks seems like the kind of guy that will stick his foot out for shooters to land on when he gets mad.  If you're not above punching Mike Conley, what won't you do?"

"Fuck that guy!   Who cheap-shots Mike Conley w/not one, but TWO kidney punches?!?!"
He literally punched Mike Conley.
Brooks won't throw shots at Rudy or Joe. Just 6'1 Mike Conley. Fake tough guy
Wtf is up with Dillon Brooks kidney punching Mike Conley
Lol Mike Conley and Dillion brooks trash talking each other
"Memphis fans, do you find yourselves rooting when Mike Conley makes a shot and then realize... wait..  he plays for the Jazz now?"
"So down to earth. When I hear about jerk fans saying stupid things and being racist, I think about how gentle and calm and based that Mike Conley is. All fans need to be like him"
God I love Mike Conley  The only universal opinion in this thread
Wait were they booing Mike Conley?
Who’s better Jrue or Mike Conley?
Mike Conley
