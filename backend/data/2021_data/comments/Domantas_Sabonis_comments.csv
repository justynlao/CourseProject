"East front court is stacked but I definitely think he makes it. Here is a table of the players that I think are genuine contenders for an All-Star spot in the East front court, with the players I deem to current be a lock bolded. Sabonis is 90% of the way to being a lock and I'd be really surprised if he didn't make it at this stage.        |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS▼|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |**Kevin Durant**|F|E|BRK|16|30.9|7.4|5.6|0.8|1.4|2.9|0.520|0.447|0.873| |**Joel Embiid**|F|E|PHI|16|28.3|11.1|2.8|1.2|1.3|1.2|0.544|0.404|0.840| |**Giannis Antetokounmpo**|F|E|MIL|19|27.3|11.0|5.7|1.1|1.1|1.2|0.558|0.280|0.593| |**Jayson Tatum**|F|E|BOS|13|26.8|7.0|3.7|1.2|0.7|3.1|0.484|0.435|0.833| |Jerami Grant|F|E|DET|20|23.6|5.9|2.9|0.9|1.1|2.6|0.448|0.402|0.866| |Gordon Hayward|F|E|CHO|20|23.0|5.3|3.6|1.3|0.6|2.3|0.503|0.430|0.856| |Nikola Vučević|F|E|ORL|21|22.6|10.9|3.5|1.1|0.5|2.7|0.478|0.441|0.837| |Julius Randle|F|E|NYK|22|22.4|11.1|6.0|0.8|0.2|1.4|0.471|0.369|0.816| |Khris Middleton|F|E|MIL|20|21.2|6.4|6.0|1.1|0.2|2.7|0.517|0.458|0.922| |\**Domantas Sabonis**|F|E|IND|20|20.6|12.0|5.7|0.8|0.4|0.9|0.543|0.327|0.696| |Tobias Harris|F|E|PHI|18|20.3|7.0|2.7|0.9|1.0|2.2|0.514|0.464|0.833| |Bam Adebayo|F|E|MIA|18|20.1|9.3|5.3|0.8|0.9|0.1|0.588|0.400|0.860|"

"This fucking title...  ""10 reasons Domantas Sabonis is an elite passer, you WONT BELEIVE number 5."""
"Tbh I don't see the point of voting in locks like LeBron, Giannis, Steph etc since they are assured spots whether I vote for them or not.

"Bruise Domantas Sabonis, and he will simply drop more triple-doubles."
Domantas “worst actual all-star” Sabonis
I would like to start my campaign by saying that both Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner definitely deserve all-star spots.   Malcolm Brogdon should get consideration. Probably either him or Collin Sexton should be the last guard.

"That's Domantas ""worst all-star selection in a long time"" Sabonis to you!"

Another kind of edgy one Domantas Sabonis
"I'm responding to his Pacers comment about injuries, the one to (Domantas) Sabonis last year hindered them significantly in the playoffs"
"Yea his last 6 games have been: serge ibaka twice, chris boucher, Myles turner and domantas sabonis, nikola jokic, and now Marc gasol and Anthony davis. And his next few games are lamarcus Aldridge, Mitchell Robinson, Rudy gobert, and then KAT twice (if he’s back from covid). 3 straight weeks of tough learning, but he’ll bounce back soon enough"
**Eastern Conference:**   STARTERS:  G - James Harden  G - Kyrie Irving  FC - Giannis Antetokounmpo  FC - Kevin Durant  FC - Joel Embiid  BENCH:  G - Trae Young  G - Bradley Beal  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Jaylen Brown  F - Khris Middleton  WC: Zach Lavine  WC: Domantas Sabonis  **Western Conference:**   STARTERS:   G - Luka Doncic  G - Stephen Curry  FC - Lebron James  FC - Kawhi Leonard  FC - Anthony Davis  BENCH:   G - Damian Lillard  G - Devin Booker  FC - Paul George  FC - Nikola Jokic  FC - Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: CJ McCollum  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is what I'm predicting to happen though I think KAT and Ingram both will deserve it over couple of the people mentioned
“Oh! A specTACular move – by Domantas Sabonis!”
"Serge Ibaka for Domantas Sabonis, Victor Oladipo and Ersan Ilyasova should be mentioned as one of the worst trades in recent history. I don’t know what the Magic was thinking"
Kyrie for Domantas Sabonis.  Who says no?

domantas sabonis is lowkey a true maestro
"See: _the entire 2016 draft class_  Nearly every single prospect from that class was looking like boiled ass their rookie years. Like, they were all _horrendous_.  From the lottery, not a single one of Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, or Domantas Sabonis managed to break past averaging 10 ppg their rookie years, without much positives to show besides maybe the very occasional ""oh look at this huge game/huge play he just had! See, he has potential!"" game."

Domantas Sabonis 6'11 - I haven't really tuned into the Pacers till this season and for some reason I just didn't see it. I can't explain why but he looked shorter to me.

Domantas Sabonis and Malcolm Brogdon have to get a 3rd team consideration with the start to the year they've had.

"PF-Centers that come to mind, whether starting at one and transitioning to the other at different stages of career/roster/or even mid-game: Channing Frye, Al Horford, Kevin Love, Paul Millsap, Domantas Sabonis,  LaMarcus Aldridge, even Giannis plays a fair bit at 4/5...Porzingis as well has that flexibility.   Are PFs really getting smaller/faster/more skilled more so than any other position, or is that just happening more pronouncedly at the 4/5, where there was the most room for improvement? It'd probably be fairer to say there has just been an overall blurring of the lines between roles rather than focusing on just the meta changes at the PF"

"Thats some revisionist history. Myles turner was very obviously a talented player, right away. He was a big man who could shoot and block shots among the league leaders. Domantas took a bit more time to show off the skills he had and they were harder to see. He wasnt shooting from outside and absolutely was not blocking shots like myles. I dont think youll find anyone who will say domantas was a scrub and now theyre surprised, i think the logic was that the pacers had a quality back up big with a different skill set than their bonafide two way young starter with stretch potential. Nowadays its different because of how they developed but youre buggin if you think people disrespected sabonis"
Do you guys remember when the Pacers and their fans thought Myles Turner was better than Domantas Sabonis? The disrespect after everything this man has done for them
"Shaq and Chuck thought well about Domantas Sabonis when he got announced as All-Star last season, they liked his hustle and playing style."

Domantas Sabonis?
Domantas Sabonis and Jerami Grant
"Domantas will solve the mystery of ""what if Arvydas Sabonis played his entire career in the NBA""."
Fuck as much basketball as I know and I actually never put together that Domantas is Arvydas’ son.. why am I so stupid i just thought Sabonis might be a common last name in Lithuania
"Domantas Sabonis is fucking elite. Top twenty player. People are finally waking up to him.   He's a developing shooter who is one of the best big man cutters in the game. Second best big man passer behind Jokic. He's even effective playing next to another big.   He's really, really good."

"2017: Took Josh Jackson over De'Aaron Fox, Jonathan Isaac, Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo.   2016: Took Dragan Bender over Jamal Murrayand Buddy Hield, and then proceeded to also take Marquese Chriss over Domantas Sabonis."
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don’t think there’s ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
Okay so why shouldn’t we expect Devin Booker or Domantas Sabonis to speak out about it then?
"Only 4 players in the league average at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists a game:   Nikola Jokic (All-Star)  Giannis Antetokounmpo (All-Star)  Julius Randle (All-Star)  Domantas Sabonis (All-Star)"
I ask everyone in this thread. You are trying to win an NBA Basketball game. Would you rather have Domantas Sabonis or Bam Adebayo? I'd much rather have Bam
"In terms of current-day players, the best comp I can think of is Domantas Sabonis. Walton was a way better defender and just overall a better player, but he was the same sort of strong scoring big man with the ability to run offense as a low-post playmaker."
PG: Devin Booker   SG: Jaylen Brown   SF: Jayson Tatum   PF: Domantas Sabonis    C: Bam Adebayo
"I think Orlando is an even better example at how hard it is to pick outside of the top-2, even if you have a high pick:        2013: Victor Oladipo #2 overall (not bad, but traded him before he broke out)       2014: Aaron Gordon #4 overall         2015: Mario Hezonja #5 overall         2016: Domantas Sabonis #11 overall (traded to OKC)               2017:  Jonathan Isaac #6 overall           2018: Mo Bamba #6 overall"

I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
Now time to bitch about Domantas Sabonis being snubbed
"The second part of your argument is stupid tbh. Domantas deserves to be an AllStar but not over either Jay. I would argue over Vucevic the most. Sabonis is the best player on a very good, pretty deep and balanced team that is barely above us, while Tatum and Brown are basically the only reasons we are even in the playoffs as of now. Take Sabonis out, the Pacers drop a bit. Take either Jay out, the Celtics plummet."
"or you know the fact that Sabonis is 6'11 and massive and Jaylen Brown is 6'6 and not massive.      Domantas is averaging 22-12-5, on basically the exact same true shooting percentage, so it's weird like you are acting like Brown has him beat in basic counting stats, most people would probably rather wont 6 rebounds and 1 assist than 4 points."
" Domantas Sabonis got super snubbed, should’ve probably made it in over Tatum or Simmons"
Orlando Magic - 32 games played         Nikola Vucevic  - 32 games played  Indiana Pacers - 29 games played         Domantas Sabonis - 29 games played  Neither player has missed a game.
"As a fan i'd like to see some of these guys play. The All NBA / All Defense Teams are about awarding people. All Star Game is more about being fun.   Some guys left off, that definitely could be fun if they were involved. And Conley constantly getting left off through his career.  * Trae Young * DeMar Derozan * Domantas Sabonis * Tobias Harris * Devin Booker * Mike Conley * De’Aaron Fox"
East:  Trae Young  Jimmy Butler  Khris Middleton  Domantas Sabonis  Bam Adebayo  West:  De'Aaron Fox  Devin Booker  DeMar DeRozan  Brandon Ingram   Christian Wood
"Domantas ""Tonya Harding"" Sabonis"

"&gt; Damn no Sabonis  No, it’s spelled “Domantas Sabonis”  Easy mistake"
"Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic, Domantas Sabonis, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Goran Dragic"
"This is my prediction for the East All-Stars to provide some examples as to why the Raptors don't get in.      |PLAYER|TEAM|Conference|Position| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Joel Embiid|PHI|E|F| |Kevin Durant|BKN|E|F| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|E|F| |Bradley Beal|WAS|E|G| |Kyrie Irving|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Jayson Tatum|BOS|E|F| |Domantas Sabonis|IND|E|F| |Julius Randle|NYK|E|F| |Jaylen Brown|BOS|E|G| |James Harden|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Zach LaVine|CHI|E|G| |Trae Young|ATL|E|G| ||||| |Nikola Vucevic|ORL|*Unlucky Miss|F| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|*Unlucky Miss|F|       The Raptors two best chances for a spot are FVV, who I don't think is better than any of the 4 guards I listed in addition to the starters revealed. Then for Siakam I don't think he's better than Vuc or Bam who I think are going to be an unlucky miss among the forwards."
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I’d have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ————— 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
Isn't this the same moron who said Domantas Sabonis was the worst All Star of all time? Fuckin dork.
"Pacers: Rik Smits, Domantas Sabonis, Paul George, Reggie Miller, Vern Fleming"
"The stats mean nothing when you’re relating it to game script especially in regards to best and most consistent teams in the league. The Nets have underperformed since the Harden trade. I find it easy to look at stats and prove the narrative you more pushing but a Lebron/Joel Embiid have had a better year and bigger impact, as has a Nikola Jokic, Stephen Curry, or even Paul George when he’s not busy dealing with COVID issues. So those stats are impressive for sure but you’re not gonna tell me that Domantas Sabonis hasn’t meant more to his team than Harden has at this gesture which is what MVP awards are mostly tailored around."
whenever i get sad i just think about how my team has domantas sabonis and i feel a little better

"&gt; In their first meeting last season, Turner had 2 fouls -- both drawn by Embiid in the act of shooting -- before the midway point of the first quarter. He lasted until the fourth quarter in a close game until Turner was hit with consecutive fouls in 4 seconds. He'd entered for Domantas Sabonis just 23 seconds prior.  &gt;Turner had more fouls (5) than points (3) or rebounds (3) in 29 minutes.   &gt;Embiid missed the next two meetings with injuries, but when the teams played in the Orlando bubble it was a mismatch again. Embiid had 41 points and 21 rebounds while Turner fouled out in 20 minutes with 9 points and 2 rebounds  This is what scared them. Embiid is the Celtics #1 weakness and Embiid eats Turner for lunch every single time."
"Randle is currently 14th in the league in Win Shares, 23rd in BPM, 12th in VORP, and 10th in RAPTOR WAR.  He's putting up career high points, rebounds, and assists (22.4/11.1/5.6). He hasn't missed a game this season and leads the league in minutes played.  I think he should be considered a lock for the all-star team if you're looking at stats, both traditional and advanced. He has a stronger statistical argument than guys like Trae Young, Khris Middleton, Bradley Beal, Bam Adebayo, Kyrie Irving, Zach Lavine, Domantas Sabonis, and Ben Simmons.  You can make individual arguments here and there, Kyrie/Beal/Trae/Lavine's scoring numbers, Bam and Simmons' defense, playmaking, team record, etc. But take the overall package and compare Randle to each, and I think Randle deserves a spot more than most of those guys."
Domantas Sabonis played like booty cheeks tonight and still got 25 pts
"For the 1 millionth time.   **Ainge didn't want Turner**.    Turner is not what the Celtics need. The Celtics need someone who can defend AD/Embiid/Giannis at least decently. Turner gets absolutely bodied by all of them, ESPECIALLY Embiid who is our #1 worst matchup in the entire league.    &gt; In their first meeting last season, Turner had 2 fouls -- both drawn by Embiid in the act of shooting -- before the midway point of the first quarter. He lasted until the fourth quarter in a close game until Turner was hit with consecutive fouls in 4 seconds.

"I’m not really good at making this, but the one I like the most is:  Lonzo (1$), Curry (3$), Kawhi (5$), PJ Tucker (2$), Domantas Sabonis (4$).  Everyone can shoot the 3 ball, got some good defenders in Kawhi, PJ and Lonzo. Got some good playmaking as well (maybe too much actually lol) with Lonzo, Sabonis and eventually Kawhi who can be a point forward. Idk, every possible team as flaws obviously, this is just the one I like the most"

"My list, with short explanations:  1) Donnic - it's not close, he's the next great star in the NBA.  If I could pick any player in the league to start a team with, it would be Luka right now.    2) Ben Simmons - there are going to be MVP considerations in his future.  Even if he never learns to shoot, Simmons will be, at worst, a Millionaire's Russell Westbrook in terms of size, athleticism and talent.   3) Jason Tatum - one of the absolute best young players in the game, I thought, long and hard, about including Jaylen Brown in this list, and if it were top 10, Brown would have easily made it.    4) Donovan Mitchell - he is a star, in every sense of the word, and will be a star for the next decade to come.    5) Devin Booker - this last slot came down to him or De'aron Fox.  It was close between them.    Next five for me, in no particular order:  6) Fox 7) Jaylen Brown 8) Jamal Murray 9) Domantas Sabonis 10) John Collins"

"I can't really give you a reason for a specific game, I would have to watch that game. Was Valanciunas playing? He's usually going to grab more rebounds than then opposing center. Tillmann has also proven to be a good rebounder and Gorgui Dieng is an important part of the rotation. Not that many teams play three centers on a regular basis. But other teams with a strong frontcourt still fare well on the rebound department. Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner combined for 24 rebounds in their win over the Grizzlies. Keldon Johnson of the Spurs had 10, DeAndre Ayton 16. Dwight Howard and Ben Simmons combined for 34 rebounds against them... These are just a few games played in January.  The Grizzlies actually rank 15h in rebounds per game and 16th in opponents rebounds per game, that's average. Here and there you're always going to find stretches where other team's bigs or in general aren't going to rebound as much."
Domantas Sabonis?
"I feel like only reason to knock Sengun is cause he is a center, he looks like Domantas Sabonis out there.  Nix also.  I thought he did pretty well in G League relative to expectations, surprised he seems to have seen his draft stock fall.  He was regularly the best performer of the Ignite's four NBA prospects.  I'd take him over some of the mediocre upperclassmen college guards getting mocked in the first round."
"I think he'll end up being the next like Domantas Sabonis, who really comes into his own when he's able to play more like a 4 than a 5"
I'll go with Domantas Sabonis and Zion.  Sabonis drops his shoulder in the post. If he has Zions body he's fouling out in the first quarter
"Those two are joined by Ersan Ilyasova, Enes Kanter, and probably Domantas Sabonis."
"Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, Nikola Vucevic, One of the boston guys.. Should I continue?"
"&gt;Domantas Sabonis 11.6 on 57%TS  See, I thought we'd just gotten ourselves a solid player who's pretty good at rebounding, is maybe defensively challenged, hopefully could have his dad's passing skill even though it didn't really show up materially yet -- but I didn't know he'd come to average 20/11/6 for us -- shit was beyond my wildest dreams  And this is the sort of other thing I wanted to allude to -- he didn't get there right away, it took him until his 4th season to fully blossom into the player we know him as now."
"&gt; Not a single one of those guys averaged even 10 points a game their first years, and they all had awful efficiency.  Second-year stats below Domantas Sabonis 11.6 57%TS Jamal Murray 16.7 58% TS Jaylen Brown 14.5 58%TS Pascal Siakam 7.3 55% TS"
"Lol everyone in the 2016 draft class was a late bloomer -- think about the other good players from that draft:  * Domantas Sabonis * Jamal Murray * Jaylen Brown * Pascal Siakam  Not a single one of those guys averaged even 10 points a game their first years, and they all had awful efficiency.  The only players that were good right away from that draft were Brogdon and Simmons.  Growth just takes a lot of time for some players."

"&gt;So you're trying to ascribe value to Embiid for the team being worse when he sits - that's not how it works. He gets no credit for those games, his value is zero in each one.   This is one of the dumbest statements about a team game I've ever heard. I guess LeBron James has zero value to the Lakers this season because he's missed games. No. That shows how important a player is to their team. If your record gets 20% worse when a single player sits, they're quite valuable to your team. Moving on.  &gt;Even if Embiid is more valuable per game that he plays, Jokic is still very valuable, and because he plays more games his value will surpass Embiid's.   How? If Jokic wins more games. Sure. If he put up his current stats and goes on a losing streak, then I doubt we'll be having this conversation in a month. Someone else will become the front runner.  &gt;Value over replacement - Jokic is at 5.8, Embiid at 2.7.  &gt;Win shares - Jokic at 10.7, Embiid at 6.2.  I can't believe people still quote these stats. They're next to useless. Do you think Domantas Sabonis is the 19th best player in the league? Do you think Montrezl Harrell is the 10th best player in the league? Also, since we're using WS. Why not use WS/48 where Jokic .300 and Embiid is .295. DRTG where Embiid is third and Jokic isn't top. ORTG, where Jokic is 6th and Embiid is 19th.  You can use crappy stats to favor either side of the argument. Advanced stats in general that aren't player specific(RTG, WS, VORP) are mostly trash. I'm trying to imagine in what world someone would look at VORP and WS and be like Mikal Bridges is better than Jamal Murray."

"Bucks gotta be my pick.  - Draft Joel Embiid in 2014 (over Jabari Parker)  - Draft Domantas Sabonis in 2016 (over Thon Maker)  - Draft Norman Powell and OG Anunoby (with the picks they traded for Greivis Vazquez)  - Hold onto Malcolm Brogdon (instead of letting him go to the Pacers)  That's a lineup of: Brogdon / Middleton / Anunoby / Antetokounmpo / Embiid, which Powell &amp; Sabonis off the bench."
"Thunder trading Harden  Magic trading rookie contract Oladipo for Serge Ibaka, I think that trade also cost them Domantas Sabonis  The 2012 Laker “superteam” with Kobe Dwight and Nash  Knicks FO failing to manage the Kristaps situation properly  Kings drafting Bagley over Luka (this one is a little unfortunate, I think Bagley’s development has been stunted by injuries, else I think he’d be viewed as a premier prospect still, if a bit raw and definitely not as good as Luka I imagine)  Not a bad decision by the team, but a player: Boogie declining that offer from the Pels. He didn’t win a ring either for that pay cut with GS, so it was all for naught, and now he’s looking for work. Rough.  Tempting to put the Wolves’ D’Angelo Russell trade here but I’m fairly sure it helps keep KAT happy and he’s not necessarily a bad player."

Suns could have drafted   * Jamal Murray  * Domantas Sabonis  * Donavan Mitchell  * Luka Doncic  Instead of :  * Dragan Bender  * Marquese Chriss  * Josh Jackson  * DeAndre Ayton  to pair with Booker since. This game can be played with pretty much every team in the lottery.
"&gt; Don't forget Butler has been rising steadily in terms of stats and doesn't look likely to slow down anytime soon.  Out of his last ten games *two* were against teams with a win% higher than .500. This season he has played seven games against teams that are currently .500 or higher, and against those teams he has an average BPM of... 3.2. So no, I disagree that the numbers of his recent games (which still fall short of the basic averages of other MVP candidates) are bound to continue.  &gt; Nobody is saying they'd vote Butler if the season ended today.  I responded to someone saying he should be a candidate. Someone else has said he is a top 8 candidate.  Once again:  * He has missed 14 games so far * He falls significantly short of other candidates on basic metrics that yes, are *not* advanced, and are *not* the full picture, but nontheless MVP voting has generally followed in the last five years.  It would be unprecedented on *multiple* levels if he were to receive significant votes. It would be so unprecedented basketball-reference doesn't even list him in their tracker, which goes down to Rudy Gobert at 1.6%. Here are some players that an unnamed betting exchange valued at over $2 billion has listed as *more likely* to win MVP this season:  * Jaylen Brown * Domantas Sabonis * Kyrie Irving * Bradley Beal * Jayson Tatum * Anthony Davis * Devin Booker  If your argument for 'serious consideration' is 'But what if?' then I can throw up hypotheticals for, say, Julius Randle (he has a higher VORP! They have an easier schedule ahead! Not missed a game yet!) and the whole thing can be meaningless."

"He was a great passer, even more than the 4.2 apg would suggest.  He didn't possess elite explosiveness and didn't run the floor all that well but he had great feel, timing and coordination along with his size and strength.  Tough to see a modern comp, I guess he's a little like a poor man's Jokic, although he couldn't shoot and moved better.

"Michael Jordan, he was gambling like crazy, he was great on ball, but he definitely had a lot of bad moments off the ball  Currently :  \- Mason Plumlee : Malone always used him as a defensive sub, despite the fact that he's not even a better defender than Jokic, he plays hard, but he makes a lot of mistakes, fouls a ton, he's average at the absolute best  \- Kelly Oubre and Gary Trent Jr : those 2 together because they are the same, they play ultra hard, they put on a show, tap on the floor, get on a ultra low stance....but I've actually rarely seen them stay in front of anyone decent, and both aren't strong enough for the real big wings  \- Domantas Sabonis and Brandon Ingram most people think they are average/slightly below average, in reality they are terrible  \- PatBev : he's still useful because he's strong for his size and can switch but he fouls a toooon and a lost a lot of lateral quickness  \- Khris Middleton : he's still a decent option on big wings because of his size but since his injury a few years ago he' snot been the same athlete at all, he can't stay in front, he execute the scheme well, and can send his guy to Lopez/Giannis at the rim, but he can't stay in front of guys  \- Lou Dort : he might be THE best iso defender in the league, but he's not that good at getting trough screens, guarding off ball movement, he's a great defender, but he's gotten a bit overrated  \- Robert Covington : great help defender, a really mediocre on ball guy  \- Donovan Mitchell : the new Russ, still has a defensive reputation because he was good in college, he's at best average, probably worse than that.  \- And to finish the one that will get me downvoted, he's an awesome defender, but Ben Simmons isn't the DPOY"
"I got chu fam  Nate Bjorkgren, Indiana Pacers (30-34, 9th Seed in Eastern Confernce)  When the Pacers fired McMillan just weeks after giving him a one-year extension in late August, there were two traits that had clearly led to his exit: His hard-nosed style had caused consternation among players, and his unwillingness to embrace analytics was seen as a problem that simply had to be fixed. Bjorkgren, who had worked under Toronto’s Nick Nurse and made several G League stops along the way, was supposed to represent a change of direction on these two fronts — a new-age coach to take over a talented roster.  While he is indeed far more invested when it comes to coaching in accordance with modern-day NBA thinking, Bjorkgren’s abrasive style has come as a surprise — in interactions with players and his own coaching staff members — and led to the kind of frustration that has caused significant concern. It hasn’t been reserved merely for the players, either, as several sources cited instances where Bjorkgren’s personality and tendency to be controlling with assistant coaches and other staff members caused unnecessary tension.  Players throughout the roster have voiced their dissatisfaction with Bjorkgren and their general unhappiness amid a down season, including key star players in Domantas Sabonis and Malcolm Brogdon, sources said. Those sources say Bjorkgren has implemented an analytics style of coaching that players privately do not find suitable for the roster, and that there have been issues among the coaching staff at times. Bjorkgren has worked to address matters internally, and one source described him as “over-communicative” to make sure he is sharing and receiving messages from the roster. One coaching source predicted that this would have a similar ending to what took place in Charlotte in 2013, when former St. John’s assistant Mike Dunlap was fired after just one season amid widespread player frustration.  Indiana’s front office, led by president Kevin Pritchard and general manager Chad Buchanan, has built a players-first culture. After a loss in early April, Pritchard had an emotional message to players: Sources say the longtime executive tried to assure the players that the season would improve and their fortunes would turn.  As always, the contracts of all the involved parties is an important part of the context. Bjorkgren and Sabonis, in particular, both have multiple seasons left on their deals and, for better or worse, are connected when it comes to their successes and failures. Perhaps all of the principal decision-makers need a sit-down to iron out issues.  Across the roster, players are having career seasons under Bjorkgren — including Sabonis and Brogdon. The offense has been run through Sabonis throughout the campaign, and he has responded with an excellent season: 20.2 points, 11.9 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game. The Pacers, like most of the league, have dealt with injuries to key players throughout the season — currently Myles Turner being sidelined with a partially torn plantar plate in his right foot. They had to adapt to a blockbuster trade that sent Victor Oladipo out and brought in Caris LeVert. Oladipo had averaged 20 points per game in his nine games to start the season in Indiana, and while LeVert has posted 20 points per game himself since returning from his two-month absence after a procedure to cure kidney cancer.  In many ways, Pacers officials understood growing pains would come with the first-year head coach. Management had a level of comfort with Bjorkgren prior to his hire partly because of their previous history which dates back decades. What this all means going forward remains to be seen. Pacers owner Herb Simon has historically been reluctant to make coaching changes this early in the process, as every coach since he bought the team in 1983 has been given at least two seasons (Dick Versace had parts of three campaigns from 1989 to 1990, but just one complete season). More recently, former Pacers coaches like McMillan, Frank Vogel, Jim O’Brien and Rick Carlisle all had at least four seasons at the helm. Still, the level of early frustration here in the Bjorkgren era means this situation is definitely worth monitoring."

"The Nate criticism never made any sense. He takes his teams as far as the talent allows in the playoffs and has a good regular season track record. What was he supposed to do, lead a Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis led team to the finals?"
"This one doesn't really count, but Domantas Sabonis hasn't played in the playoffs since he became a starter (i.e. All-Star). His team made the playoffs every year of his career so far, but he was a bench player in every season and was injured last year.  So while he's been in the playoffs, we haven't really seen what Playoff Sabonis looks like as the focal point of his team."

"Ehhhh if Mitch Richmond is in, both LaMarcus Aldridge and Joe Johnson are in, IMO. Should it be that way? No. I think Reggie Miller’s inclusion is highly debatable (got to a Finals, had a semi revolutionary play style, culturally relevant/visible but everything else from his skills to his career and accolades are underwhelming). But! The basketball HOF is very steep in the baseline being hall of good. 5-7 all stars, 2 All NBA seasons and some international success can get you in. Shit, at this trajectory, Domantas Sabonis is looking like a solid bet in 10 years. The process should be way more exclusive but LMA has been so solid over the years, that he meets the criteria."

"Just going to throw out this datapoint.  Secondary ball-handlers in the NBA who averaged more than Schroder's 5.8 assists per game this season: Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and two of \[ Domantas Sabonis, TJ McConnell, Malcolm Brogdon \].  That's it.  He was also 23rd in assists, in the entire league.  And he did that playing for a coach with basically no offensive ideas beyond ""Give James the ball and watch"", ""Give Davis the ball and watch"", and ""Give Schroder the ball and watch"".  Actually, a few other stats, while I'm here.  Schroder led the Lakers in assist/turnover ratio.  He also had the 3rd-highest offensive rating, behind only James and Davis.  Sure, it'd be nice if he could shoot better, but the skills he has are not cheaply-obtained in the NBA.  &gt;I think Schroder could end up getting a 4 year, 65 million dollar contract  I will be shocked if he signs for less than $20M/year.  &gt;Do you think he will re-sign with the Lakers, or join some other team and take on a bigger role?  The Lakers cannot replace him, so it makes no sense for them not to match any offer."

"Jamal Murray  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis  Pascal Siakim  Jaylen brown and Ben Simmons are extremely close imo. Although Ben is an elite defender, Jaylen can create his own shot and defend really good as well. Which is why I give him the edge"
Domantas Sabonis or Zion
"If Gobert, Gasol Bros, Horford can make all star teams as centers in this era, I’m pretty sure Arvydas can make plenty of them coming into the league today. I mean even his son Domantas Sabonis has made 2 all star teams and his pops is a much better player(no offense to Domas he’s one of my favorite players)"
"1. Ben Simmons - biggest difference maker in the draft. Compare his stats with Brown and you'll see that despite not shooting threes and being bad at free throws Ben has higher efg% and ts%. Better in every other element of the game too. Top 3 defender in the league behind Kawhi and Gobert. Great playmaker. Handles. Unselfish. It's ridiculous to me that this could be the minority opinion. Yeah, the team around him has to fit, but guess what? Every other team in the Association is learning they need to be able to go four out too. He'd have a ring by now if the Sixers hadn't gone with Colangelo. You build around a player like this.   2. Jaylen Brown - Also really damn good. Obviously things went rotten in Boston but this guy is like the textbook example of what you want your second best player to be, and if he was in a feature role in his own team built around him his game could blossom like Harden's did. That's not too say he could be as good as Harden, but I do think he does everything so well he'd really thrive.  3. Jamal Murray - basing this on where he was pre-injury, but when he's going he's unstoppable. Also a great teammate.  4. Domantas Sabonis - Needs a good coach and a team with a plan, hopefully that's Indiana. I'm worried he's going to look a lot worse without Turner (on offense!) because I don't think the Pacers consistently were able to consistently trot out 5 competent players at the same time last year. Dude is more fluid and creative than he gets credit for. I don't think he's that bad of a defender, either, just not a rim protector, but people act like he's Enes Kanter. He was the only thing holding Indiana together at times.  5. Pascal Siakam - Toronto was set up to fail this year obviously so I don't hold this season against him. He got a bit exposed though and looks like he's more Trevor Ariza than Kobe Bryant. He's a good second option but a great third option.  6. Brandon Ingram - I'm not an Ingram believer at all. Career 14.7 PER.  Not a great Rebound%. It's Zion's team and BI will probably be the guy they flip to get him help. When I hear about how good he is it's like NO fans have something to sell, like it's a long con to pump up his trade value. For some reason I think he'll end up in Sacramento as part of a package that nets Zion a running mate like Fox."
Damn this is actually pretty close between all these guys 5 years into their careers. They’re all  great in their own different ways so it’s tough to perfectly list them. I’d probably say something like:  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons   Jamal Murray  Pascal Siakam  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis   I’m mainly basing this off who I would want in the playoffs.
"Jaylen Brown - best 2 way  Jamal Murray - best offensively  Ben Simmons - best defensively   Brandon Ingram - solid 2way wing, still want more  Pascal Siakam - will need to prove he's up to his pre-ASB 2020 self to jump ahead  Domantas Sabonis - Worst defensively, very talented, but not sure if it drives winning"

"He was also dealing with some off the court stuff while in Portland too.  My mom, at the time, worked at a drug and alcohol rehab center in the Willamette Valley and she told me recently (guess the NDA had expired) that Sabonis was at their facility more than once because his wife was dealing with an addiction problem (didn't ask what drug it was or if it was alcohol).  But she said he was the kindest person to the staff.  Would buy them all gifts and say thanks to each and every staff person personally for helping his wife.  Sabonis was there a few times with his kids (I'm assuming Domantas was there seeing his mom too).  When she told me about this a few months ago I was like ""Why didn't you tell me sooner???"" and she was like we all had to sign NDAs when dealing with his wife."
Domantas Sabonis becoming mainstream would be my guess.
"When you have the best steals guy in the league, the best shot blocker, Domantas Sabonis being a legit all star caliber player, 6th in the league in points per game while 2nd in assists, 2K legend Jeremy Lamb, and you STILL have a losing record in the Eastern conference?!  Yeah you gettin fired."
2 time all stars Khris Middleton and Domantas Sabonis would argue with you
"Arvydas Sabonis was a good big man shooter, top 4 big man passer ever, elite rim protector, and at 7 foot 3 with Orlando Shaq Athleticism was a physical specimen. Mobile like Domantas too. Averaged 16/10/3 at his best in the NBA with good efficiency, after gaining 50+ lbs of fat, 2 Achilles tears, severe knee and ankle/foot injuries, and poor recovery and rehab on most of his injuries. Top 5 skilled big man ever for sure"
"I think it can be hard to judge the talent on a team when there's such a ball-dominant player on the team. Westbrook's MVP year got called out for ""get him some help"", but look at the guys on that team that flourished when they left and got more touches: Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Jerami Grant all played 1,500+ minutes that OKC season.  Even folks like Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and Cameron Payne are playing key minutes this year for decent teams."
"Kenyon Martin Jr/Sr, Tim Hardaway Jr/Sr, Gary Payton II/Sr, Cole Anthony/Greg Anthony (never realized he was his son until just now), Seth and Steph Curry/Dell Curry, Austin Rivers/Doc Rivers, Glenn Robinson III/Glenn Robinson Jr, Domantas Sabonis/Arvydas Sabonis, Jerami Grant/Harvey Grant (and uncle Horace Grant)...  There's so many more current players whose fathers played but I don't remember watching their fathers... it's crazy..."
"Shows how long Vince Carter been in the league, he played against Gary Trent Sr/Jr, Kenyon Martin Sr/Jr, Dell/Steph/Seth Curry, Arvydas/Domantas Sabonis and Tim Hardaway Sr/Jr."
"&gt;pay Schroder $25m and you'll never sniff the Finals again  Secondary ball-handlers who averaged more than Schroder's 5.8 assists: Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Malcolm Brogdon, and Domantas Sabonis.  Only 25 players of any description averaged more assists, and that despite Schroder playing a good chunk of his minutes with offensive talent like Matthews and Morris.  If they let Schroder walk, they won't win anything.  While I'd rather not pay him $25m, that actually makes no difference except to the Buss Family bank account, since they are over the cap anyway.  They will be better with Schroder -- at any price -- than with whoever they could sign to replace him."
"&gt;This year it was back down to 54% which is quite bad but still above his own average.  League median is only 57%.  Schroder could obviously be more efficient, but managing even 54% in their ""system"" this season was not bad.  Vogel has no offensive ideas beyond ""Isolate James and watch him"", ""Isolate Davis and let him shoot fadeaways"", and pick-and-rolls.  Everything else was just freelancing, like on a playground.  So for a good chunk of the season, Schroder was out with some combination of Wesley Matthews, Markieff Morris, Andre Drummond, Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma, and Caldwell-Pope and they were just making up whatever.  They were completely dependent on Schroder's ability to break down a defense and make something good happen, which he often did.  Even surrounded by that largely questionable offense, Schroder averaged 5.8 assists -- which is 26th in the League, and more than all but a couple secondary ball-handlers.  The very impressive company he's in there is: Steph Curry, Domantas Sabonis, Malcolm Brogdon, and Giannis Antetokounmpo."
It doesn't have to do with team performance. It came out that Bjorkgren was disliked by many players and assistant coaches alike and that he bullied his coaching staff to the point Domantas Sabonis had to step in. He's probably getting fired this offseason.
You all will say guys from popular teams but Domantas Sabonis cries on literally every single call

ive always heard how good Sabonis' dad was in Europe. is Domantas close to what his dad was in his prime?
There is no player in the NBA that contributes less to winning yet the most to the boxscore than Domantas Sabonis.
i love how no ones talking about how robin lopez is outplaying all star domantas sabonis lmao
Wish I could upvote this twice.  /r/NBA has a surprisingly old understanding of basketball considering how young most of the sub is.   It’s why 9/10 members of this sub will tell you that Domantas Sabonis is more impactful/better than Myles Turner.
Embiid but obviously I am biased. Also a big fan of Thybulle.  Of non-76ers I am one of the weird people who genuinely enjoys watching Harden. Domantas Sabonis is also up there somewhere.

Domantas Sabonis -  make it make sense
"I still think there are some adjustments here, but I dont think it's a *terrible* framework.  I've thought of something similar if Portland was going to blow it up and Sixers were going to move Simmons for him:  Philadelphia receives: Dame + TJ Warren + Buddy Hield  Indiana receives: Ben Simmons + Robert Covington  Sacramento receives: Tobias Harris + Domantas Sabonis  Portland receives: Marvin Bagley + Tyrese Maxey + Aaron Holiday + 2021 Sacramento 1st (pick 9) + 2021 Sixers (pick 28) + 2023 Sixers pick + 2027 Sixers pick"
I’ll take one Domantas Sabonis please
Domantas Sabonis x 100  Dame is the obvious answer but your’e not allowed to talk about Dame

He could be Sabonis-esque. You basically described Domantas in your comment.
"In 2017, George was traded for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis, at a time when Dipo was seen as as disappointing and Sabonis as solid but nothing special. In 2018, Jimmy was traded for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a 2022 2nd round draft pick."
"I did a write-up a while back about the opportunity of exploring a CJ trade because I do think that's a plausible idea for Indiana. This trade though is giving up way too much for CJ though.  Here is what I had:  Indiana gets: CJ McCollum, PJ Washington  Portland gets: Jerami Grant, Jeremy Lamb  Charlotte gets: Domantas Sabonis  Detroit gets: Zac Collins, 2021 and 2023 first round picks from Charlotte  https:/np.reddit.com/r/pacers/comments/nxwkr5/oc_a_fourteam_trade_between_indiana_portland/"
"A decent comparison for him is Domantas Sabonis without the nifty passing or Thaddeus Young with worse defense.  Well he was not in my original post, so if you'll excuse me..."
"Blowout three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  * Eric Paschall  Warriors get:   * Myles Turner  * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris LeVert  Pacers get:   * Ben Simmons  * James Wiseman  * Matisse Thybulle  * 7th overall, 14th overall from the Warriors  * 28 overall from the Sixers  * 2023, 2025 1sts from Warriors  * 2023 1st from Sixers   * Filler to balance the money (Smailagic, Mulder)  So:   Warriors effectively give up Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Mulder, Smailagic, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Turner, Sabonis, LeVert. LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."

Domantas Sabonis will end up as the best player from the 2016 draft imo       RemindMe! 5 years
Domantas sabonis
Domantas sabonis
"Not trying to be a homer but:  1. Jokic  2. Embiid  3. Gobert 4. Towns  Whose the fifth guy you’re putting above Ayton? I’m comfortable putting those first four ahead based on track record but is it really crazy to have Ayton above, like, Domantas Sabonis and Nikola Vucevic?"
Domantas Sabonis’ dad
NBA all-white lineup  PG-Luka Doncic SG-Duncan Robinson SF-Gordon Hayward PF-Domantas Sabonis C-Nikola Jokic
"It looks like money wise this works:  Philly gets: CJ McCollum  Indy gets: Ben Simmons  Portland gets: Domantas Sabonis, Justin Holiday"
Paul George FOR Victor Oladipo/Domantas Sabonis
Domantas Sabonis according to Nate Duncan
yeah he put up 15/7 and was at least clearly better than Ersan Ilyadova. I really think he's gonna be Domantas Sabonis. that may not be a sustainable no.1 guy defensively but he's certainly an efficient driver of offense and rebounding. draws a shitload of fouls and makes em at 80%+.
&gt; And five more: Bam Adebayo (No. 14 in 2017); Domantas Sabonis (No. 11 in 2016); Pascal Siakam (No. 27 in 2016); Nikola Vucevic (No. 16 in 2011); Zach LaVine (No. 13 in 2014).  I feel like Brogdon was a bigger steal than Sabonis.
man ... imagine how good this Hawks team would be if they had an All-Star like Julius Randle or Domantas Sabonis
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Spencer Dinwiddie 8. Julius Randle 9. Derrick Rose 10. Joel Embiid 11. Tobias Harris 12. Seth Curry 13. Pascal Siakam 14. Fred VanVleet 15. Zach Lavine 16. Nikola Vucevic 17. Jarret Allen 18. Colin Sexton 19. Jerami Grant 20. Domantas Sabonis 21. Malcom Brogdon 22. Giannis Antetokounpo 23. Khris Middleton 24. Jrue Holiday 25. Trae Young 26. Clint Capela 27. Lamelo Ball 28. Jimmy Butler 29. Bam Abedayo 30. Russel Westbrook 31. Bradley Beal 32. Nikola Jokic 33. Michael Porter Jr 34. Jamal Murray 35. Karl Anthony Towns 36. Deangelo Russel 37. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 38. Damien Lillard 39. CJ McCollum 40. Rudy Gobert 41. Donovan Mitchell 42. Steph Curry 43.

"Domantas Sabonis is what made me start noticing this. he’ll do a DHO then McDermott or whoever doesn’t get free off the screen so they have to do some dribble moves, yet Domas gets the assist anyway"
Jaylen Brown  Jamal Murray  Brandon Ingram  Domantas Sabonis  Pascal Siakam
"Why go with Jokic. At this point Jokic-lite, Domantas Sabonis I would take over Simmons, even moreso in the playoffs."
How do people manage to spell Domantas Sabonis correctly but butcher Malco**l**m Brogd**o**n?
"Also, you can add Indiana Pacers: Domantas Sabonis, too."
I added Indiana with Domantas Sabonis.
De'Aaron Fox  Zach Lavine  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Bradley Beal  in that order

"pg13 and melo joined okc after kd left   he oso flipped ibaka into domantas sabonis and victor oladipo who both didnt stay too long in okc   in conclusion, sam presti can and does have the ability to assemble and rebuild a team, but main problem is the players dont gel well tgt   put coach pop into okc during KD's years they would have won at least 1 ring"

"super interesting. from the outside, it seems like sabonis is the choice over turner, and you're right, they really do need to pick one. as a dubs fan, domantas is the one dude i'd trade the farm for. what am i not seeing, why turner over sabonis?"
"Look at OKC’s lineup. Westbrook, oladipo, alex abrines, rookie domantas sabonis and Enes kanter. He carried these bums to the 6th seed and people say he didnt deserve his mvp lol"

"Are you just talking exclusively about NBA Arvydas? He was a far better athlete than Domantas at the same age. Mid-80s Arvydas had freakish athleticism for his size and was one of the best passing big men of all time. NBA Sabonis was him at 31 after two achilles tears and a myriad of other issues from the USSR running him into the ground physically. Domantas is good, but he is a shadow of what his dad was at the same age."
myles turner &gt; domantas sabonis
"I just feel like sabonis is way more skilled under the basket, rob catches lobs. I don't see how their games are that similar. Also I'm assuming you're talking about domantas."
Domantas Sabonis. seems like no one talks about this guys potential. A real do it all kinda big man that slots into any team nicely I feel.

"Man I wish we could have patched a trade to somehow get domantas sabonis.   Spurs give Thad young, al farooq, 2 frp  Pacers give domantas and salary fillers  And we could have signed Dougie as a free agent"
"&gt; His roster was putrid  Adams 2,400 minutes, Andre Roberson 2,400, Oladipo 2,200, Domantas Sabonis 1,600, Kanter 1,500, Jerami Grant 1,500. There's even some sneaky minutes for McDermott, Cam Payne and Taj Gibson.   I know some of those guys developed later on, but maybe Westbrook's ball dominance hid some of the talents of his teammates?"
"Doug McDermott, Zach Collins, Domantas Sabonis, Drew Eubanks, Kevin Love.  They’re hard working, lunch pail type of guys, with a high basketball IQ."
"He’s a gamer. He cares. Got into it with Miami’s bigs, chirping at refs, and clapping towards opposing players who turn it over.   Too bad Yurt7 is basically a less strength more finesse Domantas Sabonis. That young man is special. Polished af and still just 23. I hope the Warriors try and sign him tbh."
"Domantas Sabonis is the best player in the NBA, yes"
"Fair enough. Thanks for looking into it. While I don't agree with some of your reasoning, I can't deny the % stats.  Are you familiar with 2017 European Championship? Have you actually seen any of the games? Not that I'd expect you to, just wondering, seeing as you're still somewhat doubting this Slovenia team is for real. I would assume had you seen those, you would be more reluctant to write them off. That run was every bit as unlikely as this one, if not more (other than potential finals vs USA), and they pretty much dominated.  Slovenia vs France (no Gobert, but a great team otherwise): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47dfXNcnUU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B47dfXNcnUU) (domination in a blowout)  Slovenia vs Latvia Quarter-Final (vs Porzingis, before he was a bust): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-DKtLy9S1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-DKtLy9S1M) (this nail-biter is a must see for any Doncic fan, and a really fun game overall)  Slovenia vs Spain Semi-Final (against 4 years younger Gasol brothers, with a 4 years younger teenage Doncic that has since come a long way): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVSMQQ23b60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVSMQQ23b60) (domination in a blowout)  Slovenia vs Serbia Final (with Doncic hurt with 5 minutes to go in 3rd): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJH6c1oKztE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJH6c1oKztE)  I'm not here to convince anyone, I'm really just debating with people who I disagree with, so I am not posting this to convert you or anything, but rather because I think it's something many Americans are not aware of and would probably find of interest to see, especially since this was Luka before NBA, taking a back seat to Goran Dragic while destroying the basketball empires of Europe.  I'll leave this here as well:  Slovenia vs Lithuania - Olympics qualifier Final, a month ago (vs Jonas Valanciunas and Domantas Sabonis): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTb8CwRp-lc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTb8CwRp-lc)  My prediction: 95-84 Slovenia (unless it's a blowout, which I don't expect, there will be fouling in the end, probably inflating the advantage by some 6 points)"
"Also KP, Domantas Sabonis, JV just pick any Euro big. No defense, not very athletic but 7 ft"
I’d say his closest player comp is Domantas Sabonis. The guy was the MVP of the Turkish League at 18 years old playing against grown men in the 3rd best league in the world. Has a really high upside the biggest knocks against him is that he’s not too athletic and a little undersized for a center.
Don’t like the hype with Sengun. Absolute best case scenario is a Domantas Sabonis. But who needs bigs that dominate back to the basket? Even Pacer fans would rather keep Turner over their All Star
"""His best case is maybe Domantas Sabonis""  Fuck you man"
maybe domantas sabonis
Magic legend Domantas Sabonis
"Serge Ibaka for arrean Ilysova, Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis  At the time Serge was 26, a 3 time all-defensive player and making $12 million per year. Magic we’re looking to improve and compete, the move was seen as OKC being desperate to keep KD.  Serge’s career goes sideways in Orlando, OKC turns Dipo and Sabonis into PG for a few years and then Shai and more, Ersan into Jerami Grant"

Domantas Sabonis turned 25 like a couple months ago. I thought he was 28 or something because it feels like he's been around a long time.
"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
"&gt; domantas sabonis, miles turner, lance stephenson, thad young  Are you suggesting that those guys are better than Middleton, Jrue, Lopez, etc?   &gt; For KD in the last 4 games, Jeff Green dropped 27 in a pivotal game 5  LeBron had Jeff Green in 2018 too, not KD's fault that Bron didn't make the most of him. Isn't one of the popular narratives about your guy is that he supposedly makes everyone around him better?   &gt; In game 7, Harden dropped 22 (with bad shooting)  In game 7 TT put up 15/10 (with great shooting, 86 TS%)  &gt; K.Love with 11 per game  KD's second best scorer averaged 13.5 ppg. And the difference is only there because of the much higher pace this year compared to the 2018 series"
"Ok then lets focus on the 1st round. The oladipo pacers werent just oladipo. They also had domantas sabonis, miles turner, lance stephenson, thad young etc. Some great defenders and good on offense as well. They were no joke. Now lets compare the Cavs team. Second leading scorer: K.Love with 11 per game. No other teammate reaches 10 ppg. NO teammate scored 20 throughout the entire 7 games.   For KD in the last 4 games, Jeff Green dropped 27 in a pivotal game 5. In game 7, Harden dropped 22 (with bad shooting). And that was in 4 games. Throughout the series, 4 guys were averaging 10+ points per game. Way better supporting cast than what the Cavs had.   So no, he wouldnt get past the 1st round, and if he somehow did, he wouldnt make it all the way to the finals. There, happy?"
"He’s pretty much Jokic on offense, just add the mobility of Domantas, the hops of Capela, and the inferior defense of Gobert. An absolute cheat code and unicorn  To truly see his athleticism, watch the clips of him vs DRob when he was young. Then remember that this was Sabonis only a couple MONTHS before his 1st of two Achilles tears"
"Recent all-stars I definitely prefer Ben Simmons to:  Kemba Walker, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Domantas Sabonis, Khris Middleton, Russell Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, Julius Randle, Nik Vucevic, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell"
"Derrick White, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Joel Embiid  Bench: Ricky Rubio, Seth Curry, Joe Ingles, OG Anunoby, Robert Covington, Domantas Sabonis, Nerlens Noel"
"Marcus Smart as borderline all star in the same category as Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Nikola Vucevic, Domantas Sabonis, Devin Booker, De’Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, and Bradley Beal?  I’m sorry but yeah fucking right, okay buddy lmao  This is why you don’t just rely on analytics alone"
Myles Turner or Domantas Sabonis gets traded  They’re both better as centers and neither are 6th men so one has to go
"Maybe I’m biased, but Domantas Sabonis is kinda incredible. In the four seasons he’s been with the Pacers, he’s improved every season. After becoming a starter in 2018, he became a better passer in 2019. In 2020, he not only got even better as a passer, but increased his 3PT% 7 whole points. He averaged 20 P, 12 R, and 7 A last season and no one is acknowledging him. He’s a less skilled Jokic that has steadily improved each season. Barring Bam, Embiid, and Giannis, no one can stop him in the post. Against Gobert last season, he averaged 21/12/4.5. He will be a perennial all-star and will make a few all-nba teams at the very least by the time he retires."
"Domantas Sabonis:  -He gets no respect and I understand why on weak Pacer teams. With Rick Carlyle in though, I think it´s going to get him to buy in on defense. -Check out his basketball reference, he gets much more productive every year. https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sabondo01.html"
I never said you said Demar was a failure. I said you said there’s no value in floor raising which is absurd.  And your explanation for why klay was better is because he benefits a contender more than Demar does. The same logic applies to Covington and Russ. I acknowledge the difference between the two on a skill level is larger but Your reasoning still applies to those two. If you want a less extreme example how about Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner ?

"Domantas?  I'm a Sabonis stan. If the Lakers had him, they win the series even if AD is at half-strength. Domantas is awesome - 22/12/7, I'll take that   That man can ball"
"This is an interesting draft cause there are 4-5 guys with arguments here. Between remaining potential, what they’ve done so far, fit, it could still be Ben, it probably would be brown, but there’s also arguments for Jamal Murray, Brandon Ingram and Domantas Sabonis"
"Now that Domantas is a legit star and a relatively well-known player, ppl can’t just be saying Sabonis anymore lol"
"Sure, I bet they could do 5-8 years of alternative picks+swaps however the Stiepen rule or whatever works and I guess that makes it, but it also seems so silly for th Wolves, specifically. You're potentially sacrificing a half decade-near decade worth of potential high ranking assets for a player who by all accounts might get you to the second round.  Like I'm not happy with the Simon's, but I gotta imagine it's cheaper/easier to spend on mid priced undervalued assets like TJ Warren, Caris Levert, and Domantas Sabonis, if the goal is to fill seats and make a profit, and if the goal is to compete well, I don't see this doing it either."
"EFG% and more specifically TS% account for the extra variables you are tracking. TS% accounts for all three percentages and weighs them by respective attempts, as you can imagine people like curry and harden, who have not only high percentages, but also insane volume, do very well.  TS% is also pretty cool because you can more easily compare different styles of play, like demar derozan versus steph curry, versus Davis Bertrans versus domantas Sabonis. You still need the eye test to understand why they are different, it can be enlightening to know that joe Harris has a higher true shooting percentage than deandre ayton. (66 versus 65)"
"Domantas Sabonis went to HS with my sisters, so I got to meet him and his dad Arvydas.  Really quiet but nice, I’m happy to see him succeed.     Allen Crabbe would get his nails done with his GF, super laid back and friendly guy who didn’t mind chatting and shooting the shit talking ball.    Noah Vonleh was really bashful and didn’t mind talking but you could tell he was not a people person haha, came off just kind of shy.    CJ McCollum is really friendly and always has time for anyone, I met him a few times and even though I was the “help” he was always so nice and made me laugh.    Terry Stotts is also super nice, I remember one time he and CJ were watching an ESPN segment at the practice facility that started commenting on the Blazers about how Dame said this or that, which had Stotts and CJ laughing because it was clearly false.    My favorite though was waiting in the Atlanta airport when suddenly I hear in a booming Cookie Monster voice “I HAVE ARRIVED!” and turning around I realize it’s Dikembe Mutumbo at the ticket counter, announcing his presence with a beaming grin on his face.  It was hilarious, and it started a trend in my family where we would imitate that dramatic entrance- there is something incredible about announcing yourself when you walk into a room haha!"
"really confident: Domantas Sabonis. i don’t think people realize how close he is to averaging a triple double and he’s only 24. if he can get 1 or 2 threes a game and up his free throws, he’s gonna be like 25/12/8 lmao  somewhat confident: Tyrese Maxey. he loves the big moment and will take and make clutch shots. a crazy amount of different finishes from both hands at the rim. willing and pesky defender. if he can shoot off the bounce, i think it can happen   Shot in the dark: Desmond Bane. a flamethrower and he seems to have made a leap in summer league. needs to get to the line a lot, but i think can be a star"
"Domantas Sabonis. If you don't follow the NBA closely or are a Pacers fan, people have no idea why he is making all-star teams. He is a lesser version of Jokic, people. If you watch him play, he eats up nearly everyone in the post aside from Embiid, Bam, and Giannis. Brute strength and raw skill make him what he is. He averaged 20 PGG, 12 RPG, and 7 APG this past season and casuals are like ""wHy DiD pACeR maKe aLL sTaR teAM?"" He runs the Pacers' entire offense. Him getting those handoffs to Dougie at the top of the key were his bread and butter. Watching the majority of the Pacers games these past two seasons and I can tell you this; Domas rarely has an off night. Me and my friend joke that an off nigh for him is only 12 points and 8 boards. I'm telling you guys, he is only going to get better."
"Portland, OR Top players are:  AC Green Damon Stoudamire Terrell Brandon Domantas Sabonis  You tell me who the best is..  I’d say maybe Green honestly.  Best is highly subjective, but green had a lengthy and successful career, no all-star years but we all know that’s a popularity contest more than anything."
Julius Randle or Domantas Sabonis
Dario Saric  Domantas Sabonis  Nikola Jokic
"Luka Doncic, Domantas Sabonis, Larry Bird, and Steve Nash"
"Oh definitely. It's unfortunate that he has a glaring weakness on D, but it's kinda crazy that we know Simmons as a great playmaker, while we don't consider Sabonis as such when they have almost the same number of assists (although I do know that it is much more nuanced than that)  I just find myself rooting for Domantas because he is kind of in the same boat as KAT; skilled C's on offense but cannot be relied upon to anchor the defense. It will be interesting to see how he expands his game moving forward"
"&gt; Lol y’all literally forget how bad that thunder squad really was. All of them are bums now except brook.  Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Jerami Grant, Steven Adams...  Wtf are you talking about?  Sabonis was literally an All-Star *this year* my guy."
"Domantas Sabonis is American, if he doesn’t count then Hayward definitely"
"Dame yeah.  Also while I believe his ceiling is crazy high, I think the idea of Ja Morant is better than he actually is right now (although part of it might be that his ankle was a problem for longer than I knew last season)  Domantas Sabonis, people don't realize how much a below average defensive big puts a ceiling on a team unless he's basically Jokic on offense (and Domas isn't close to that)"

Arvydas and Domantas Sabonis have to be one of the best examples
"Chris Duarte is going to have the best season of all the rookies this year.   Domantas Sabonis is going to be an All Star for his 3rd year in a row.   LaMelo Ball is the best Ball brother, and it's not particularly close. He legitimately may be an all star this year.   I would fake an injury if I was ever tasked with guarding Steph Curry  Russ simply will not work with the Lakers. I don't like Dennis and they shouldn't have paid him his 80 mil, but Russ is a downgrade considering his contract."

They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
"&gt;  finishing between Josh Jackson and Isaac Okoro.  and also tied with Domantas Sabonis. I think this is a bit disingenuous, bad players can shoot free throws well, good players can shoot them poorly."
"Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney, but do Mike Conley, Demar DeRozoan, Julius Randle, and Domantas Sabonis beat Jordan Clarkson, Matisse Thybulle, Joe Ingles, Bobby Portis, and Montrezl Harrell?

"&gt;So if we don’t want players leaving teams by asking for trades   For me, I much prefer the extension and then trade option. A lot of fans get to complain about the likes of AD and PG leaving NOLA and indy, while they tune in to watch Brandon Ingram and Domantas Sabonis with stunning cognitive dissonance. If the Blazers got some pieces back for Aldridge we might have had a deeper team right now.   I actually think the system is fine how it is, but there needs to be a streamlined way to get these trades done. Maybe a time limit whereby GMs must strike a deal or it goes to league office for arbitration or something."

Rick and Brent Barry would qualify; so would Arvydas and Domantas Sabonis. They’re probably the best father son duo actually.

Julius Randle&gt; Domantas Sabonis
"Domantas Sabonis, biggest fraud in the league. Should be a super sub but inexplicably is a featured offensive player who has a million DHOs and P&amp;Rs ran for him to stuff his scoring #s."
"I’m kind of on the Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis, Zion Williamson train right now. They’re old school lefty power forwards who feast in the paint each in their own ways. It’s refreshing to see today."
"IDK, Ben Simmons did average more PPG in his last postseason series than Domantas Sabonis did.   The Pacers have some good regular season players, but Ben Simmons is a decisively better player in a postseason series than the Pacers current franchise player."
"Lamelo, Dejounte Murray, Draymond Green, Bam Adebayo, Domantas Sabonis, Ben Simmons 😖"
"He'd be perfect next to Draymond. I can't think of a better PF for him to pair with, especially on a team with the spacing we (will) have.   I would do this in a heartbeat to contend now:   Warriors get:   * Domantas Sabonis  Pacers get:   * James Wiseman  * Moses Moody  * Salary filler (Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder)  * 2022 1st  A lineup of Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Sabonis with Poole/Otto/Iguodala/Juan Toscano-Anderson/Looney bench and depth of Avery Bradley/Lee/Kuminga/Bjelica makes me wet"
Pacers get:  * Ben Simmons  * CJ McCollum   Blazers get:   * Tobias Harris  Sixers get:   * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris Levert   * Malcom Brogdon
&gt;  A rookie max extension is given to basically anyone with all-star potential nowadays.  I think the John Collins and Jarrett Allen deals gives the Suns some leverage. High level shot creators get paid.  But a lot of other guys on the level of Jaylen Brown and Domantas Sabonis did not get maxed.
"uhhhh, domantas because hes the better player? lol the point isnt whos better the point is caruso gets outsized attention compared to sabonis just because hes was in la. If domantas sabonis was in LA he would be a household name. If caruso was in indiana no one would have heard fuck all about him"
"yup, more people can recognize alex caruso off the street than domantas sabonis. That says it all"
"Here are some excerpts from the article where the author describes how Ben can be an effective halfcourt scorer (make sure to watch the including videos).   **Ben Simmons postup game:**  &gt; When thinking about untapped areas, I keep going back to that game from this February against the Utah Jazz, where Embiid was absent and Simmons went up against Defensive Player of the Year candidate Rudy Gobert. Ben ran the offense through the post, going against Gobert or others through backing them down. He’d take his size advantage and a cleared-out lane to his advantage. While we think so much about what Simmons’ lack of shooting does for Embiid’s spacing, we don’t spend nearly enough time talking about how Embiid’s presence takes away all of Ben’s post-up looks.  &gt; With that lane cleared, he could use his length to play one-on-one and his explosion showed. Great touch off the glass, good patience and use of pump fakes, and superb touch with both hands:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xUmbP75Jis  &gt; Size advantages create most of these opportunities, as well as the Jazz willingly playing him one-on-one. If Simmons gets enough volume in post-ups, we know he’ll hurt teams who do over-help and bring doubles: he’s far too good a passer in every other fashion for it not to translate. As for judging the sample of his time in Philadelphia, it’s so hard to look at the post-up numbers due to Embiid’s presence and both Brett Brown and Doc Rivers’ insistence on not exposing Simmons at the 5. If you do, as a scorer and passer out of the post, Simmons was just as efficient (0.99 PPP) as Giannis (0.99), Karl-Anthony Towns (0.966) and Jayson Tatum (0.959). That number should increase with more spacing.  **Ben Simmons pick and roll:**  &gt; As a pick-and-roll handler, Simmons’ violates one of my main tenets in initiating offense: he doesn’t shoot it. Teams can go under against him and clearly contain him from the lane, forcing him to either take the shot or not put enough pressure on the rim to force help defenders to collapse. Without helpers tagging the role and squeezing the lane, catch-and-shoot kickout avenues won’t develop.  &gt; Simmons encounters those issues on middle pick-and-rolls quite frequently, where driving around the screen would push him wide and ultimately away from the rim. On side ball screens, when his penetration around the screen generates a paint touch, he’s actually fairly effective. Part of the reason for that: teams cannot ice screens and go under at the same time. When they go under and try to meet him on the other side, Simmons is so damn lanky and long that one bounce and enough explosion allows him to get to the front of the tin.  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hb9C8kvGwQ  &gt; A great breakdown by Shehan here. Note that Embiid does a fantastic job screening his own man here so that Simmons only has one body to navigate and finish through.  &gt; Now imagine that play with one of the league’s premier pick-and-pop threats. Embiid can shoot (23-59 on pick-and-pop catch-and-shoot jumpers) but as we said earlier, he’s absolutely dominant on the blocks. Teams would rather live with the Embiid pop than anything he (or Simmons) get at the rim. Replace Joel in that action with a guy like Karl-Anthony Towns (24-59 but with a 60.2% aFG%, taking more treys) and perhaps the defense hugs KAT so much that Simmons gets to the rim, or even draws a help defender for a kickout.  **Ben Simmons in a free-flowing offense based on dribble handoffs:**  &gt; Clearing out one side of the floor just for Simmons to score in the lane isn’t an ideal usage of a team’s time. But there are great ways to flow into that action from a 5-out or delay series in the NBA. The quick swings and handoffs from the Indiana Pacers playbook last year are examples of how to get Simmons the ball on the move. Not only does that put him in the situation to play through the pick-and-roll but might catch some teams unable to go underneath screens:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKjMTEMUl5g  &gt; Here’s the catch: pair Simmons with the right team and he can be Domantas Sabonis in the clips above at times, too. A hybrid 5 who has the offensive game of a wing (think KAT, Christian Wood, Chris Boucher) to cut or space while Simmons trails to the middle of the floor would be incredibly dynamic, even if it’s only for brief moments. A small-ball Simmons at the 5 grouping might be the best way to unlock late-game or playoff Ben’s ceiling.  There's more if you read the article."

Notable forwards who are likely All-NBA candidates during MPJ's contract:  * Julius Randle  * Jayson Tatum * Brandon Ingram * Lebron James * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Kevin Durant * Jimmy Butler * Paul George * Domantas Sabonis  He's obviously an offensive juggernaut (his monthly splits in the last 2 months of the season speaks for itself) although is he going to put up those same numbers when Murray is back. The ability isn't being questioned but more so the amount of opportunities to put up All-NBA numbers.
Domantas Sabonis is the most overrated player in the NBA
"Agree with some of this but:  - The Thunder may have technically picked Quickley, but the Knicks told them which player to select, the trade was already agreed to - Bazley is awful. He had decent counting stats because he plays 30 minutes, but he wouldn't play 5 minutes a game on a playoff contender  - I agree that is a tough range to pick from, but if we're going to pretend Presti is a top notch GM, he needs to occasionally hit on picks in that range like the Moreys, Masais, and RC Bufords of the NBA do.  Here's the ""actual"" Presti picks during that time for reference:  17	OKC	Aleksej Pokusevski 34	OKC	Theo Maledon 37	OKC	Vit Krejci 23	OKC	Darius Bazley 45	OKC	Hamidou Diallo 53	OKC	Devon Hall 57	OKC	Kevin Hervey 21	OKC	Terrance Ferguson 11	OKC	Domantas Sabonis 56	OKC	Daniel Hamilton 14	OKC	Cameron Payne 48	OKC	Dakari Johnson 21	OKC	Mitch McGary 29	OKC	Josh Huestis 55	OKC	Semaj Christon"

Domantas Sabonis. His shooting splits are normal (his FG percentage is still insane for someone that isn’t all that athletic by NBA standards) but something is off. I don’t think he fits whatever it is Rick Carlisle is looking for. It shows in the team record.

Portland: Probably Gordon Hayward or Domantas Sabonis - somebody who can play the 3/4 or 4/5.
"Pacers get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Robert Williams  * Payton Pritchard  * Bruno Fernando (filler)   * 2021, 2023 Celtics 1sts  Celtics get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Domantas Sabonis  Celtics upgrade with great players in their prime. Brogdon/Smart/Tatum/Horford/Sabonis is really great and solves their ball movement issue.   Pacers retool to get younger and acquire a young star in Brown. Duarte/Brown/Levert/Turner/Williams is pretty great. Maybe move Turner for a PF that fits better. Could probably get KP and a couple picks from the Mavericks for him, for example."

"thank you. Just say it as it is. Why are people trying to come up with dummy reasons as to why we get more national recognition than others? Austin Reaves aka Hillbilly Kobe is going to be more popular than domantas sabonis in a few weeks, its not because somehow we have finals expectations and pacers dont. Caruso is the most popular player on the bulls, its not because he just drips charisma and lavine doesnt. Peoplle need to be fucking real. We get more attention because we big market and we are the fucking lakers"
