Who the hell is calling him black??? He’s THE whitest guy in the league. Corny ass Kyle Kuzma East
"You: Completely not understanding hyperbole and believing the 30th pick in the draft has any type of value.  Me: Understands they aren't getting Kyle Kuzma off the books completely without taking any salary that, when the Lakers don't even have a max slot for Kawhi with him off the books.  You: Continues arguing about a deal that is impossible anyway for a variety of reasons because you think sparse draft picks with little value could sway the Clippers to participate in a franchise killing sign and trade, which wouldn't work under the salary cap even if they could get rid of Kuzma."
He's having the same trajectory as Kyle Kuzma. Great rookie campaign then mediocre second year while being a liability on defense. Theres just so much you can get out of a 6'4 white dude
He's the Kyle Kuzma of the Heat.
"""You're not Kyle Kuzma! Oh wait, yes you are..."""
Vintage 2018 Kyle kuzma help defense on display
Who said Kyle Kuzma was 6’10 lol p sure nba.com has him at 6’8
"I just want to say that I *always* hated the Lakers. I gave them one night of rooting for them in Kobe's last game (bonus points that it was against the Jazz), but other than that I couldn't stand them hyping up Lonzo Ball and Kyle Kuzma as the next big things. I also thought Brandon Ingram would bust (his poor free throw shooting did not inspire confidence in the KD comparison), so I'll take the ""L"" on that."
"yeah that’s true but you also gotta consider that some of their role players schroder, harrell, gasol are not coming off of a short off season and without developing those habits with your superstars as a season long process is gonna be tough when it comes time for them to “turn it on” which is exactly what we did last year. that and kyle kuzma saying they don’t practice, which is also what we did last year, is just really similar. again, not saying you guys can’t do it and i’m not even really drawing any conclusions about how it’ll affect the outcome of either team’s season, just saying that the similarities are there and they’re pretty wild to watch in real time."
"https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/14/kyle-kuzma-warriors-loss-raptors-nba-championship-karma  Most non-Warriors fans were thinking it, Warriors had a fair bit of injury luck in their run so it was a bit ""karmic"" that their run came to an end due to injuries."
That's the second NBA player to call Klay's injuries karma. Shout out Kyle Kuzma.
"Yes because defensive Specialist ""Kyle Kuzma"", a DPOY candidate can guard Jason Tatum and Brown of Jaylen better than Montrezl.   Let me remind you this:  Jayson Tatum dropped 41 pts on Kuzma's head on insane efficiency.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRzq7rz4QQo  Do you honestly believe Kuzma or the Morris dude can do better than Montrezl Harrell? You need to think hard about this before answering me. If your answer is yes then we won't argue anymore. I can't change your mind/opinion. it is what it is."
Kyle Kuzma field goals made - 4
Kyle Kuzma - 1 ring in 25 years of existing.  Celtics - 1 ring in 34 years.  If you don't like it these are the facts.
Tell that to the idiots who drafted Kyle Kuzma.
I saw a Mavs fan call him Latvian Kyle Kuzma lmao. Hopefully he either turns it around or the Mavs can trade him for a better second option because I want to see them succeed with Luka.

Ight but we get Kyle Kuzma too since he’s better than Tatum
We counter offer one Kyle Kuzma and a bag of Anthony Davis chips
Kyle Kuzma nowhere to be found in this thread
"I just wanna say, Kyle Kuzma is my favorite Laker player rn"
Tobias Harris is Kyle Kuzma wish he could play like him
Kyle Kuzma could honestly learn a lot from studying Tobias Harris
Kyle Kuzma omfg
Look at Kyle Kuzma man
Kyle Kuzma is leading the game in rebounds lmao.  More than Embiid and more than AD.
Kyle Kuzma is a great kutter
"That's the thing, Shamet was a huge exception.  Top 3 3PM for rookies in 17-18:  1. Donovan Mitchell  2. Kyle Kuzma  3. Lauri Markkanen  18-19:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Landry Shamet  3. Trae Young  19-20:  1. Coby White  2. Kendrick Nunn  They're all volume shooter iso players besides Shamet. 3pt specialists just don't get that many shots as rookies."
"I mean yeah their roster isn't amazing but you'd expect more out of team with a COTY, an MVP candidate in Steph, a solid 3&amp;D wing(at least recently) in Wiggins, a second #1 pick in Wiseman, plus Draymond who is still valuable defensively. Like we've seen worse teams do a lot better than play .500 ball. I mean for fucks sake Lebron somehow went 20-14 before he got injured playing with Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma and the useless Luke Walton. Or when Russ willed his Thunder into the playoffs in 2016  This is nothing against Steph and Kerr, but for years everyone's always said Kerr was probably one of the best coaches in the NBA and Steph was one of the best players in the league. Yet there's always so many excuses. playoffs."
I think if your chemistry get low enough your team intentionally trades for Kyle Kuzma to be on your team
Team take and you get ball more if you hit A with low team chemistry people like Kyle kuzma will ignore you and shoot fadeaway 3s when the games on the line
Montrell Harris is a nickname for Kyle Kuzma.
"Teams don't play him competitively either.  Lebron was playing us and Kyle Kuzma goes up to the rim and he's against a weak but taller defender, Lebron is already walking over and gets the putback because he knows Kyle's chances in that moment are slim. He was jogging over before the ball even bounced on the rim.  He makes moves like that all the time and he pushes guys into their weak corners, and guys just let them. He'll direct his own guys into their best spots and relies well on KCP to stay on his target %s.  Lebron is going to jog/coast until people understand why he's good and actually challenge him. He's the superteam. And I'm saying that as a not-Bron stan. lol"
Kyle Kuzma
Imagine getting blocked by kyle kuzma lmaoo
&gt;Giannis playing against his idol   Kostas has confirmed Giannis idolized Kyle Kuzma growing up
 that was a very Kyle Kuzma shot by KCP
does kyle kuzma have a soundcloud album yet or what? link pls
"You’re telling me the bulls aren’t trading him to the lakers for completely useless pick swaps, the 30th pick for 3 years and Kyle Kuzma????????"
"Kyrie ‘Kyle Kuzma’ Irving.   No but seriously the guy has been nothing but issues since coming to the nets, barely playing, starting controversies, leaving, it’s just annoying and if he doesn’t play absolutely flawless and win every night im gonna point the blame his way. Maybe unfairly at times but still gonna do it."
"Kyle Kuzma role on that team? He's the best player on that not named KAT, and Dlo&gt;&gt;&gt;Kuzma."
"They aren’t good enough outside of KAT to win now even with someone like Beal. I think DLo is just not good enough, he should be in a Kyle Kuzma role."
A case can be made for Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma :)
It's funny how their success story in terms of drafting and development is Kyle Kuzma
"Curry, Dame, Luka, Jokic, Boban, Alex Caruso,   On the flipside.  Paul George, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, PatBev, Kyle Kuzma"
"&gt;The trade would include a package consisting of guards Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Dennis Schroder, forward Kyle Kuzma, and a first-round selection each from the 2022 and 2027 drafts.  So in this hypothetical, the Lakers roster would turn into:  James/Beal/Matthews/Davis/Gasol  Caruso/THT/Dudley/Morris/Harrell  With just Cook left as a reserve point guard, that guard depth is looking pretty thin."
"&gt;The trade would include a package consisting of guards Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Dennis Schroder, forward Kyle Kuzma, and a first-round selection each from the 2022 and 2027 drafts.  Oh my goodness gracious"
Prayers to Kyle Kuzma for having Russel Westbrook as his teammate
His defensive improvement is the better thing to focus on IMO. The Kyle Kuzma of two seasons ago would’ve been unplayable in last season's playoffs.
"Lebron answered this in his postgame interview last night. [At about 1:30 on this video.](https://www.nba.com/lakers/video/teams/lakers/2021/01/18/84426/1611042270175-210118lbjweb-84426)  Reporter: &gt; Kyle Kuzma said that it's a 72 game season and maybe it's going to be hard to keep the urgency up. Is there some human nature complacency going on here that could have been part of the recipe tonight?  Lebron: &gt; Nah.  Lebron himself said the Lakers were not ""coasting"" and he sounded like he was being very blunt/truthful to me. I also don't think somebody as great as Lebron would pass up the opportunity to style on his biggest rival during a nationally televised game. Lebron hasn't had the opportunity to play against Steph/Draymond while having the superior roster since 2015. He definitely was trying to win, but I think he underestimated Oubre and Wiggins particularly what they've been doing on defense this season.  I also think that he expected AD to be much more aggressive, but Draymond was able to significantly disrupt AD's rhythm early on and AD doesn't have as much motivation to beat the Warriors as Lebron does. Lebron was clearly upset at the loss and there are several highlights of him expressing his frustration during and after the game. The Warriors beat the Lakers, straight up.  That being said, I fully expect the Lakers to come prepared the next time they meet especially with how hard their fanbase + Lebron seems to be taking this loss."
he means kyle kuzma
Alex Caruso and Kyle Kuzma both would make excellent puppets if someone were to craft them of felt
Kyle Kuzma looks like an old lady lmao

mans flexing on kyle kuzma. have some shame
Here we watch Kyle Kuzma check into the game and immediately put up a brick 3.
"Maple Jordan by far      who is better for memes, kyle ""lebrongunatradeu"" kuzma or andrew ""maple jordan"" wiggins?"
Yeah and Kyle Kuzma will be a star one day. We'll dream together

Trae Young because the media nuts every time he had a highlight like he’s a superstar but the dude will never be “the guy” on a good team. Also Kyle Kuzma.
Kyle Kuzma with 13 rebounds. Didnt expect that.
Leading rebounder Kyle Kuzma???
As we all predicted Kyle Kuzma was the rebound leader in a game w Zion and AD and Trez.
Kyle Kuzma just signed a deal with RC Cola
 [Kyle Kuzma rn](https://images.app.goo.gl/FXQzdgqbr4FJRQdt6)
"True. Lakers recently have done well too with Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr., Kyle Kuzma and Talen-Horton Tucker all taken late"
"Caris LeVert has been below league average efficiency every year since his rookie season. He just isn’t that good, and he’s not a young guy with a ton of upside anymore. Statistically, he a shorter, less efficient Kyle Kuzma with better playmaking."
"So that toward the end of the season when people are concerned that the Lakers don't have enough players to beat the nets, they can trade Kyle kuzma and a 2026 unprotected 3rd rounder for oladipo."
"There’s nothing more impressive than being pushed by Kyle Kuzma of all people during a game to play defense when LeBron was load managing. As a LeBron stan, I feel The King deserves a medal."
"See Kyle Kuzma. If he was drafted by say the Pistons, nobody but hard-core nba fans would even know he exists."
"&gt;	You are incredibly short sighted if you think it was just lucky hits in the draft (where we had the Celtics scraps btw).  And I don’t think you really even had any Celtics scraps to speak of in the draft — the KG/Pierce trade was three 1st round picks outright, and only one 1st round pick swap.  From the pick swap you got the draft pick you sent to the Lakers in exchange for D’Lo, which they used to draft Kyle Kuzma."
"I think this is very true. It’s like when Rondo said he had to stay on Bron to change his body language his first year in LA because when the young guys made mistakes and Bron got down on them they would be hurt and it would effect their play, because they didn’t want to let him down.   “When guys are making the same mistakes over and over and over, it’s hard to bite your tongue but I tried to get [James] to focus on his body language…Those young guys were looking at everything he did. If they missed four shots in a row and LeBron was making a face, it was crushing to them. He was their Michael Jordan. They didn’t want to let him down. But if LeBron said one thing positive to Brandon Ingram or Kyle Kuzma, they immediately were back to their old selves.”"
Kyle Kuzma? More like Kyle Poozma.
one is a good player and the other is Kyle Kuzma. you tell me
"You're forgetting the Lakers also have Kyle Kuzma and Markieff Morris for those minutes too though. The Lakers already have a crowded roster that goes a legit 11 deep. Dwight being there would be an insane luxury, but honestly he'd probably be upset over a lack of minutes (or if not him, then someone else would)."
"That's if Kuz had a good game beforehand.  If not, ""Kyle kuzma gets an F-"""
"""kyle kuzma gets an A+"""
"Kyle ""Ken Kaniff"" Kuzma"
"Yall should trade Lebron, AD, THT, and Kyle Kuzma for him 🙃"
Kyle Kuzma for me lol. Went to the University of Utah with him and every run in with him was just fun and genuine. Always gonna root for him because of that.
"I don't think you can compare Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Ray Allen, Shane Battier, Udonis Haslem, Mike Miller, Chris Andersen, James Jones an aging Rashard Lewis, and Mario Chalmers to Schroder, Wesley Matthews, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Alex Caruso, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and an aging Marc Gasol.  You're looking at 4 possibly 5 hall of famers on that heat team.  Hell, this Lakers team might not even be better than last year's team."
"6th man is interesting. A 6th man on an average or bad team can look way better than they actually are, but other times it truly is a case of just already having a star in the same position. The lakers have a few people better than Clarkson on their bench. Kyle Kuzma and Montrezl Harrell are both better than Clarkson and are having a tremendous impact but the Lakers bench seems to be deep enough that no particular bench player seems vital for the Laker’s success."
You forgot Kyle Kuzma. He is also a very clean-skinned player.
"Just for kicks, Kyle Kuzma shot 54% on corner threes last year.  Curry hasn't been near that in six years, and only exceeded 40% once in the past four -- so I'm pretty sure whoever it is, it isn't Curry.  Thompson has only broken 50% from the corner once, years ago.  Right now, it might actually be Seth Curry, who's at 83% so far this season."
"[If you try it in the trade machine it fails.](https://tradenba.com/trades/V2i_Ivd4v) Cook isn't listed as an option (I think his contract is non-guaranteed), but I replaced him with McKinnie who's making an almost identical amount and it still failed. Both teams being hard capped and Kuz being a poison pill this year means he almost surely can't be included in any trade between the two teams. Kuzma's $13 million contract doesn't kick in until next season. This year he's only making $3.5 million, but the extension makes it a poison pill. Click that link for a further explanation for all the reasons why your theoretical trade doesn't work:  &gt; Poison Pill &gt;  &gt; Kyle Kuzma is on a rookie contract and signed an extension that is to begin the following season. Therefore, he has what is known as a ""poison pill"" contract. He can no longer be traded for a player making equal money. Instead, his current salary is averaged along with the salaries he is to receive in his extension, and that average becomes his incoming salary for trade purposes. His outgoing value for the Lakers will be $3.5M while his incoming value for the receiving team will be $16.5M."
"In all honesty what do the Lakers need to add. They have upgraded or sidegraded while raising their depth by so much. Getting last years 6Moy and the runner up on the same team is broken in itself. Then they still have Marc Gasol, Caruso, Kyle Kuzma a full second unit of players that are borderline starter ready for the right team."
right im a bandwagoner who chose the name kuuuuuuuuuz after kyle kuzma was drafted and wayyyyyy before we got lebron james. fuck off
"“During this pandemic, all this stuff is going to be different. Some players might get corona, get sick, not be able to be with the team for 10 days. I think that’s going to be a big part: Which team is not going to have positive people.”  It's a pretty obvious comment. The only reason it was ""controversial"" is because Kyle Kuzma disagreed with it, because Kuzma has beef with Luka for no reason."
Kyle Kuzma sort of
There isn’t one. The Lakers selected him. How these trades get reported is “lakers draft Kyle Kuzma via the nets” and the only reason they wait to complete the trade and didn’t just trade the pick was likely to circumvent the rules for trading picks in back to back years or cap rules.
Kyle Kuzma wasn't wrong.
Why would we trade away our relevancy away for a dollar tree Kyle Kuzma bro smh
"2017-18 Harden, 2016 Draymond Green, 2018 CP3, 2019 Ibaka, 2015 Iguodala  Bench: Steven Adams, Patrick Beverley, Kyle Kuzma"
"Man, just crawl back to the Lakers sub so you can play soggy biscuit with a picture of Lebron or whatever it is you do to cope over there. I'm sorry to say but whenever a good defensive team throttles Lebron and AD down, Kyle Kuzma or Rondo aren't going to go off to save you 4 times in a row. The Lakers wouldn't even be able to handle the semifinals Sixers from '19, much less the actual champions."
Have you seen the coverage around Kyle Kuzma? Or any Laker for that matter
I need DeAndre Jordan to massacre Kyle Kuzma in the same fashion he did Brandon Knight. Oop coming from Harden. That'd be perfect.
Kyle Kuzma has a whole gf he’s been dating for almost 2 years

"MPJ is like an alternate reality version of Kyle Kuzma.   Kuz actually has gotten a lot better and smarter with his recent payday, not sure of that’s what would help MPJ."
Lou Williams and Kyle kuzma aren't even close to stars.
"Star - A **good** player / Key piece on a contender. Think Lou Williams or Kyle Kuzma  All-Star - An all-star.. pretty self explanatory. Randle, Jaylen Brown, Bam Adebayo  Superstar - Good enough to be the best player on a championship level team. LeBron, Kawhi, AD, KD, Jokic, Steph, etc."

"Look, I understand that it's common for people to try to trade garbage for real assets but this isn't one of those times.  Have you watched either of those guys?  Luke is a 6'5"" guard that shoots 44% from 3 and is only 24.  Hes going to make ~$14M.  Similar cost to Jordan Clarkson and Kyle Kuzma.  Far from terrible for a great shooter that is still improving.    Marcus morris was highly sought after last off-season during FA.  He's shooting a blistering 49.2% from 3 and can guard 3-5.  He's going to make ~$16M per year.  That's around what Bertans and Derrick White are going to make.  Raptors want young guys and vets and these 2 fit those needs.  They're both in long contracts that are easily tradable.  Clips just don't have 1st round draft picks to offer.  Even though it won't happen, if clips included Zubac then raptors would accept.  Keep in mind raps are rebuilding and don't expect to contend for a couple years."
"it's fine I'm used to Kyle ""Ariana Grande with testosterone"" Kuzma"
Jordan Clarkson vs. Kyle Kuzma*
Kyle Kuzma is nothing more than a good role player and he got endorsement deals without looking like a meme plumber. He makes $3 million per year from Puma.
"I say three way deal....  Sacramento gets-Kyle Kuzma, KCP, Kelly Olynyk and second rounders   Lakers get-Buddy Hield, Goran Dragic &amp; Hassan Whiteside   Miami gets-Harrison Barnes, Marc Gasol &amp; Talen Horton Tucker     Sacramento gets Kyle Kuzma and sheds Barnes salary. KCP and Okynyk give them veteran bench pieces.   Lakers improve their backcourt and get a good rim protector.   Heat gets Barnes as a stretch 4, Gasol becomes a sold backup to Bam and Tucker becomes a young piece and can learn from Iggy."

"&gt; Well link it if you can find a ton of source.  You are the one that said it has been debunked multiple times. Surely you can find one source? That is my entire point you are the one that said it has been debunked multiple times and I am the one questioning you saying this isn't true and you have no sources.  &gt;Look bottom line is if he was that good he would be playing more than 17 minutes a game  He has missed games at two different stretches due to the same right ankle and it has been bothering him for that even more than that considering he tried to get back in and then missed games from it again. My entire point is that he is missing time because of his injury.  &gt;If the lakers was missing Kyle Kuzma that wouldn’t be considered “injury trouble”.  Cam Payne has had minute restricted because of his foot injury and listed as questionable for several games. One of the biggest reason the Suns are winning now is because of their bench which ranks number 1 in the league in terms of net rating. Cam Payne is a big reason for that. A big reason the Mavs were decent last year was because of their bench. If Seth Curry was forced to miss a bunch of games and play less minutes than he normally does, it would have hurt them greatly as well."
"Holy shit those have to be the worst stats I've ever seen in my life lmfao.  The first one has Lamelo Ball above Kawhi leonard and Kyle Kuzma above Ben Simmons.  The other one has CJ Mccollum at 11, which is laughably stupid, and Devonte Graham at 9."
"Well link it if you can find a ton of source.  Look bottom line is if he was that good he would be playing more than 17 minutes a game, nba teams have talent evaluators that spend tons of time around these guys and if he isn’t playing more there is a reason.  Honestly though it’s just really hard to take serious that someone bringing up a bit player like that and saying missing him has been a big loss and not acknowledging that a bunch of other playoff contenders have missed legit stars for major portions of their campaign. If the lakers was missing Kyle Kuzma that wouldn’t be considered “injury trouble”."

"I just think with the amount of picks they had, their depth should be better than it is. In the post-big 3 era how many second-rounders did they have? and how many of those worked out? I know that most second rounders don't work out, but to have as many as they did and for them to basically all be bad picks is the reason they have no depth. The last two champions have had players drafted in the second round rounding out their depth: Norman Powell and Kyle Kuzma.  Like quickly scrolling through some drafts right now, in 2015 they took Jordan Mickey above Richaun Holmes and Willy Hernangómez and Marcus Thornton over Norman Powell.  In 2016 they took Demetrius Jackson when they could have taken Georges Niang.  2019: Tremont Waters over Jalen McDaniels.  The only really solid second round picks I came across, where there weren't better players taken right after, were Abdel Nader and Semi Ojeleye."
AND THEN HE DIDN'T HELP KYLE KUZMA UP
I agree that he definitely should’ve performed better but Kyle Kuzma was also terrible in that game
Tied with Kuzma? As in *Kyle Kuzma*? *THE* Kyle Kuzma? Wowee wow what a top shelf baller😍😍
He then said he would add Bam to the list of players he would trade Kyle Kuzma for.

"Okay, use a teams seeding while ignoring literally every other factor to determine how good a player is. Joe Ingles and Kyle Kuzma are better than Luka. You’re a genius.   UNSUBSCRIBE."
"No one brought anything offensively other than LeBron and Kyle Kuzma. The only other player to score in double digits was Harrell, with 10 points.  We need to shoot better from the 3. 26.7% tonight is not good enough.  We were without Anthony Davis, and Dennis Shroeder, two of our top 3/4 players. We definitely felt their absences tonight.

Kyle Kuzma game changes like his hair
"THT  &gt; But his best basketball is likely several years ahead of him, and the Lakers are very much in win-now mode. L.A. also isn't guaranteed to see his full potential come to fruition. He'll be a restricted free agent at season's end, and a robust group of suitors could price him out of the Lakers' budget. Finally, Horton-Tucker's youth and upside arguably make him the best trade chip in L.A.'s collection, since the club can't trade any first-round picks. If the Lakers pursue even a mid-tier target, Horton-Tucker might have to be included to get the deal done.  KUZ  &gt; Kyle Kuzma is playing arguably the most complete basketball of his career—and is matching the fewest minutes he's ever played (25.0). It all comes down to his curious fit with this core. He's doing a better job than before of adjusting to his new position on the team's hierarchy. He is growing by leaps and bounds defensively, and his three-ball is falling much more regularly than it had the past two seasons (36.1 percent). But he isn't a playmaker or a premier stopper, and even his growth as a perimeter shooter only puts him at roughly league-average. That calls into question his ability to coexist as a complementary piece for the Lakers' best players. He might be the third-most talented player on the roster, but he doesn't feel like a lock when it comes to the club's late-game closing unit in critical postseason contests. Kuzma deserves credit for molding his game as best as he can, and the Lakers shouldn't be in a hurry to let him go. Saying that, it would make sense to sniff around the trade market to see whether he could bring back a player who could more cleanly fit alongside Davis and LeBron James."

"Yeah go chase Kyle Kuzma since you like championships so much.  Might as well only trade for KD Bron Kawhi or Steph since only they can win titles.    There's 29 ""failed blueprints"" a year.   Im absolutely shocked a Rockets fan of all people would be so hard on for players with rings considering Harden was your star.  Are you also flaming Harden for not being a championship player?  Not every player wins a title.  It takes way more than one player.  Harden is my favorite player outside of the Clippers and it's absolutely ridiculous to hear people judging players based on a ring.  I see who Shaq's idiotic RINGZ comments are for now.  Keep talking out your ass while you fade to irrelevance chasing unicorns and rainbows with your picks"
"Giannis is the 2 time MVP of the league.  Idgaf if I don't win the title.  Give me talent on my team.  Only one team wins the title every year.  You're chasing a pipe dream ESPECIALLY after you lost Harden.  By your championship defining logic Harden isn't good either cause he couldn't reach the finals.  Go trade for Kyle Kuzma.  He's got a ring!  Aside from the fact that you are blind to the fact that Simmons is a top 20 player at worst, you still haven't answered how drafting rookies in the teens since you don't have your own pick next year or praying on the Nets picks in a few YEARS from now is going to help you build around 25 year old Christian Wood.  By the time your picks come around Wood will be nearing his 30's.  If you wanted to build around Wood, Simmons was your best bet.  Simmons is succeeding DESPITE the awful fit next to Joel and he's 24.  Like how do you not see ANY upside there but want to gamble on picks years down the line or keep wishing your miracle championship superstar can be traded for some day.  That is if they actually want to be in Houston since every star dictates where they want to be now."
"Those are incomplete numbers for this analysis.  Do the math on available attempts.  Some of those players played with Bryant -- good luck getting more than a couple shots a game in that situation -- and as shown by this very post, the Lakers were deep with young players who need lots of chances to figure out what works for them, and what doesn't.  Ingram: 11.5 FGA in Los Angeles, 17.8 in New Orleans  Clarkson: 12.6 FGA in LA, 13.4 in Utah  Russell:: 12.7 FGA in LA, 17 in Brooklyn, 19 in Golden State, and 17 in Minnesota  Ball: 10.3 in LA, 11.2 in New Orleans  Nance: 5.4 in LA, 7.3 in Cleveland  Randle: 10.6 in LA, 16 in New York  Russell, Nance, Randle, and Ingram have also seen their minutes rise since heading east.  There's only one ball ( lower-case ), and it's tough to develop that many players ( and Thomas Bryant, and Ivica Zubac and Josh Hart and Kyle Kuzma and Mo Wagner ) in such a short span -- especially when you have Bryant and James.  There are recent ex-Lakers all over the league in part because they just drafted so many good players that they had logjams everywhere -- and that probably hurt almost all of them, to so degree or another."

"First part for those who can’t access it:  &gt;There was a choice to be made.  &gt;“It all depends what you want in this sport, to be honest,” LeBron James said. “... Do you want to score a bunch of points but sometimes it doesn’t really matter or doesn’t make a difference in winning or losing? Or do you want to be a part of something special where you continue to get better, you continue to make an impact and you have a role on the team where you’re playing for something more than the sum of your individuality?”  &gt;Anyone who closely watched Kyle Kuzma’s career with the Lakers couldn’t be sure which direction he’d pick.  &gt;In his first two seasons with the Lakers, Kuzma scored — a lot. He was a 17-point-per-game scorer before his 24th birthday on the Lakers — endorsements and fame coming far before any winning.  &gt;Left with the Lakers after the team traded the rest of their future for Anthony Davis, it was time for Kuzma to decide.  &gt;He’s chosen wisely.  &gt;Armed with a new contract, an NBA championship and comfort in his role, Kuzma’s shaped his game around the stars on his team instead of trying to star alongside them. And it’s working.  &gt;In the Lakers’ 115-105 win over Memphis on Friday, Kuzma scored 20 points — but it was his 10 rebounds, including five on the offensive glass, that flashed like some of Kuzma’s game day outfits.  &gt;“There’s a lot of different ways you can impact the game,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “As he’s grown his offensive rebounding, he’s really gotten comfortable with that aspect of his game and has given us a huge lift — just creating a lot of extra possessions that are helping us win games. So, it’s just a testament to understand that there’s many ways you can impact the game without scoring.”  &gt;Friday was his seventh game with 10 or more rebounds this season, all of which have come since Jan. 7. Last season, his first as a player trying to find his way on a contender, Kuzma grabbed double-digit rebounds just three times in the regular season and playoffs."

They can’t all ride Kyle Kuzma to the chip
Kyle Kuzma played for a half hour and got six points. What the actual fuck
Tatum is either a top 10 player or worse than Kyle kuzma
"Kyle ""Method Actor"" Kuzma"
i have never seen Kyle Kuzma have a good game.  But they happen apparently.
it’s the exact same spot he had to get 8 stitches in on christmas. fucking kyle kuzma 🙄
"Kyle Kuzma has went from overrated, to underrated, and now he might be becoming overrated again by this sub"
What so Kyle Kuzma about to get 80 mil a year?
"We are actually pretty bad at telling the difference between extremely large and extremely small numbers because of words like million and billion feeling interchangeable. The average redditor is significantly closer to what Kyle Kuzma makes than Kuzma is to Jeff Bezos, but in our heads we just have them in the ‘rich’ illionaire bucket."
Kyle All Star Kuzma?
There are a lot of NBA players I would have liked to see on the cast listings and none of those players are Kyle Kuzma.
Dont worry the narrative has shifted to giving Kyle Kuzma a disproportionate amount of credit now.

Kyle Kuzma.
"Denver nuggets, 2021 kyle kuzma/MPJ matchup champions"
"Because that's not the team that was in the playoffs. Their top 9 guys in the playoffs were:  - Anthony Davis  - LeBron James  - Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  - Danny Green  - Alex Caruso  - Kyle Kuzma  - Rajon Rondo  - Markieff Morris  - Dwight Howard  Everyone is a positive defender, no one is an easy target to isolate on. And then two top 5 players carrying the load, including AD who had one of the best playoff runs of all time. The expression ""you're as weak as your weakest rotational player"" really confirms that they were a solid team.   But, on the other hand, the playoff competition in general wasn't that great last year."
Kyle Kuzma vs Kawhi Leonard lmao
"They'd try to pin the blame on Kyle Kuzma instead. If that didn't work, they'd fine him. Also, PEDs would be legalized the next offseason."
I’m so heartbroken. I saw my 6 year old brother lying on the floor crying. I asked him what’s wrong and he said he wanted to watch tv but Lefraud stole the remote and changed the channel to the Lakers game. He had to watch Lemickey get bailed out by Kyle Kuzma instead of his show

Kyle Kuzma?
A team last year just won with old rondo/Kyle Kuzma/KCP being the third best player...
They were weak because LeBron beat them. Remember two years later when kawhi left? And suddenly the same team with Kyle Lowry w/o DeMar was better? The east suddenly became better when LeBron left. Last year all I heard was how the lakers will face the best 8th seed in NBA history since the rockets. Then will lose to Harden and Westbrook. And then lose to the comeback kids. At first I didnt believe the east was strong. Then you see him rollover the teams in the west and then realize how weak his team is.   He rolled over all of those teams with pathetic squad. Last years lakers squad is nowhere as good as this years. Kuzma has finally found his role. McGee was playoff trash. Rondo was the only good role player on the team. KCP was hitting shots during the first two series but cooled off. Our role players are much better.
Kyle Kuzma
"Is he more of a champion than any of the hundreds of bench riders or middle of the road talent players on NBA rosters that have won titles over the years? I say yes. Is Kyle Kuzma more of a ""champion"" than Russell Westbrook because he was on the right team?"
So we're done pretending that Kuzma is the ultimate trade chip who would net the Lakers a third superstar?  That was a fun year or so of Windhorst and others talking about how the rest of the league was eager to give LA everything they wanted and needed just to shake hands with Kyle Kuzma.
"Dude’s gonna have a Kyle Kuzma-like journey, i bet. He’ll get hated on by most people because of uninformed expectations and never be the #1 scoring option in his first five years in the league, but home fans will love his year-on-year improvements because it’s a sign that he’s very professional with his approach to the game."

Our Lord and saviour Kyle Kuzma

"All nba first team lebron James, all nba first team Anthony Davis, 6moty Montreal Harrell, 6moty runner up Dennis Schroder, close to all star Kyle kuzma. Also, lets not pretend that Drummond is some scrub, he was an all star 3 years ago and ""on layups"" is such a strawman."
It was....they got Kyle Kuzma out of the trade as well.
Oh yeah  Death lineup of LeBron AD and Kyle Kuzma
"That's blatantly, objectively false. In fact it's the opposite case, and you can even check this for yourself. This pretty much just confirms that you're *way behind* on your takes.  Among SFs, Kyle Kuzma is ranked:  * 1st in OREB per game, per 100 possessions, and OREB%.  * 9th in DREB per game. 4th in DREB per 100 possessions and DREB%.  He is the best offensive rebounding SF in the league by any metric you choose, and is *at least* top 10, most likely top 5 in general rebounding at the SF position. There is literally no way to call his numbers dogshit.  You *actually* just aren't caught up w the NBA and are pretending your preferred narrative is reality."
"CHAMPIONSHIP DNA HAHAHAHAHAA  FUCKING LOL  Buys LeBron and AD, carries a G-League team to the most asterisk of a championship in the last decade and KYLE KUZMA has ""Championship DNA""  Damn and I actually thought you were A LITTLE smart. Never fucking mind hahahaha. What a fucking casual, jeeeesus."
"A barely efficient, aggressively average 3pt shooter who averages a high amount of minutes with low production and has a shitty FT%?  No thanks, you can keep your homegrown ""talent"".  Kyle Kuzma is a fucking joke.  Only reason he's famous is because he's a Laker. If he were in Minnesota with the same stats he'd be a bottom feeder nobody."
"To each their own. I hate some teams and players too but I guess my hate doesn't make me spew garbage casual takes followed by fake laughter.  Pullin for you guys to get it together one of these days, you could use a Kyle Kuzma"
"We're back baby! Who needs Drummond, Dwight or Aldridge When We have A Surging Team already.  After the big throbbing that the Lakers gave to the very game Cleveland. It's clear that the Lakers are back and we are surging again.  I watch in awe as Harrel jumped like a hyena, mauling and savaging the ball to the basket as the opposing team watched him helplessly.  Then we have Dennis who was probing like a U.F.O. almost defying gravity and slashing like an unstoppable snake. He would perform a dizzying zig zags against whomever unfortunate opponent is put in front of him and embarrass him as he swoops in to the basket.  All this and still the secret weapon of our team has not yet been fully activated. THT, a walking nuclear human weapon whose hotter than a thousand sun itself in the the recent trade deals is being conserved so that when playoff time came he would explode like the Tsar Bomb. All the NBA teams knew this, this is why they are trying to get him for whatever price they can before it's too late for the whole league.  Lastly we have KCP whose saving his ability for the playoffs. Then of course, Kyle ""Rodman"" Kuzma who has proven himself as the next Rodman of our generation has now colored his hair to signal that he's going to WAR. Fucckkk I say we're loaded baby!  So I say Drummond or Aldridge we don't need you here---please choose other teams like Nets---""we have enough"" as King James would say. Many experts says that they think Lakers need a big man like Drummond, they think they know but they don't. Have we ever heard Frank Vogel said that they need a big? I don't so, Vogel is completely contented with Marc Gasol because he has a plan .. and that plan will be revealed in the playoffs"
Yeah good thing we can cheer for the good guy Lakers and their homegrown talent of [checks notes] Kyle Kuzma and Talen Horton-Tucker
Kyle Kuzma is not one of the worst rotational players in the league. That's a laughably bad meme take
"It's extremely ironic.  He also points to fucking Kyle Kuzma as his great example lmao  Y'know, one of the worst rotational players in the league hahahaha"
Dude isn’t Kyle Kuzma the only guy left from like 2017?
They still can't beat Kyle Kuzma tho
All this to beat Kyle Kuzma and Jared Dudley
All this to beat Kyle Kuzma 🤣
"Literally Kyle Kuzma, Montrezz Harrell and Dennis Schroder are the best players outside of Lebron and AD..there’s better supporting casts on lottery teams. The Bulls supporting cast may be better than the Lakers and they have been a lottery team for years."

KYLE KUZMA
"Theoretically he could, but the hard cap makes it incredibly difficult to do so, because an extension like that is considered a ""poison pill"" for this season (the Lakers have the same issue with Kyle Kuzma, if they wanted to trade him). Kennard's contract counts much more for the team receiving him than it does for the Clippers sending him out, which makes it nearly impossible to match salaries in a trade while staying under the apron. I always tell Laker fans this whenever they bring up trading Kuzma this year, and it applies to Kennard with the Clippers: it's best to just think of them as untradable this season, as they effectively are."
"I don't know why, but the NBA Second Spectrum has a different defensive rating formula/ranking. Among players with 25+ mpg, this is how the ranking looks like:  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=MIN*GE*25&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Season=2020-21  1. Patty Mills 2. Mike Conley 3. LeBron James 4. Kyle Kuzma 5. Rudy Gobert"
"please god let Kyle Kuzma get traded to a small market team, I'll never ask for anything again"
"In the modern era you DO need to be a genius and say exactly what you mean. Everyone holds each other to those standards now - which are obviously unattainbale. Or else people like you come online and destroy them, misinterpret their context, and refuse to see any other theoretical explanation except their own as a possibility. People have latched onto this years later and never listened to the original video. They have, instead, watched everything Kyrie has done since then and reinforced their own views.     I personally understand why Richard Jefferson, Channing Frye, Lebron fucking James, and Kyrie Irving - during their championship run / the year after - might be having a candid conversation about how the media warps the truth or ""decides"" for us.      Again, it's obvious his ""flat earth"" example was stupid and ruined his point. But how can you say an NBA basketball player can't have an opinion on journalists/media? Just because his example was bad? Just because he isn't up to your standard? Is JR Smith or Kyle Kuzma (random examples) not allowed to talk about the media either simple because they aren't college educated on the subject?      Why do we have any more reason to be here talking about it? Is it because we aren't in front of cameras and microphones? I would argue Kyrie shouldn't need to ""keep it behind closed doors"". He tried to have a philosophical conversation and it backfired; reinforcing his own world view that the media and people can't be trusted.      Our society NEEDS to have a real conversation about how social media, journalists, and news control our behaviours while making us too lazy to search topics ourselves.      Seriously, sometimes I think Journalism is the 4th branch of government; it holds that much power. Yet it has barely any regulation in fear of hurting freedom of speech.     Kyrie tried to talk about stuff like this and misspoke. But then again, I'm sure I did too. And so did you. I personally stay off twitter in fear of doing so. It doesn't suddenly mean we can't talk about it. Just that what people truly mean when we speak day-to-day isn't always 100% perfection - and the media needs to come to terms with that, critically think, ask more questions, and find out what people truly mean. Including you.     If you actually did read all of this I must say you are more friend than foe!"

That’s the Kyle Kuzma difference
KYLE FUCKING KUZMA IS THAT GUY
Alex Caruso and Kyle Kuzma
"Because our best players have played like 5 games together and we started the season with the worst coach in the NBA? We obviously wouldn’t be very good either way but that’s not even the point, I never said the Wolves are a good team. You only brought them up because your trash argument doesn’t hold up so you resort to talking trash about my team because it’s low hanging fruit and, like I said before, you’re a dumbass.   If you have 3 stars how are you 11th in the East? If your team is so good why are you worse than the Knicks, Pacers, Hornets, and Heat who were missing their best player for over half the season? Freddy is good, I wasn’t even shitting on him but you got so salty I even QUESTIONED his status as a star. He’s not a star and just because you like him and he’s good does not mean he’s a star. Kyle Kuzma is good and has a ring, is he a star? JaVale McGee has got like 3 rings is he a star? Is Iguodala a star? He has a whole ass FMVP."
"Kyle Kuzma over Hart, Cameron Johnson, Crowder, Portis..lol"
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
"This was also the year everyone was saying Kyle kuzma was better than Tatum cause he was scoring more points and shooting better   Exercise some common sense here, Tatum had to share the ball with Kyrie, Hayward, brown and horford in a team that failed to provide a good system dictating how to do so. You make Tatum the #1 option and he’s very good right away, RJ will take longer to get to that level"

"People making fun of Kuzma for this are straight up wrong. Ask yourself this: if Kyle Kuzma didn't tell us when Dudley was healthy enough to play how on Earth would we have ever known?

**\[McMenamin\]** Per the Lakers: Kyle Kuzma (He's Ass) has been downgraded to out for tonight’s contest
"He dominated the league until he got ""sick"". Even after ball, he's a freaking billionaire now. He's not only won, but dominated in every aspect of life. Even as a dad, his kid is a lil different, but is also a huge success. Dude people hated him cuz he was black and Bird was white Jesus; they hated him cuz he got hiv; they hated on him when he did the MJ video ""Remember the Time""; they've hated on Magic since he was here at State. But he's done nothing but make every one of his haters eat their words. The guy rebuilt the Lakers back to relevance. Do you think any other GM could have got Bron AND AD to LA? Granted he traded away his team but it paid off in spades. He made the craziest trade in my life time. I've seen crazy trades like the Cowboys and Herschel Walker trade, bit I've never seen a team trade not only leverage their starting line up but their future in all their draft picks as well. There was like 8 or 9 assets going to New Orleans for 1 player. Who coulda been a 1 year rental. He did whatever it took. And after he secured the greatest player of this generation from his hometown. Bron coulda went anywhere, especially the Knicks, and had more commercial success. But magic sold him on L.A. and Showtime. I truly believe Magic resigned the way he did cuz the Lakers were gona get shit dir how he did it, tampering and all that. So instead of having the Lakers take the hit, he took it cuz he could afford it. And it legit rolled off his back like water off feathers.   The Lakers got their guy and they won a ring. Regardless what batteries in the next 5 years they're ahead. I'll bet every team, not named Brooklyn, would give up their next 5 years for a ring this year. Like spend 5 years at or around .500 of you gave them a ring this year. They'd all take it.   So Magic is a winner there in my book. Had Palinka got the trade done giving up less than Magic offered originally, id say he jus planted the seed, but the trade was exactly what Magic said. Ya he did it with no regard for people's feelings, especially the young guys, but you gotta remember the NBA he came from, which was brutal. I mean if you watched the Jordan documentary, the Bulls  had Michael Jordan and they were like you're opinion don't matter were trading Scottie. If they did that to the biggest asset in the league, not jus the team but league, as they didn't care,  they absolutely won't care bout people like Lonzo Ball or Kyle Kuzma.   I can say with absolute certainty that Erving Magic Johnson is the greatest point guard to ever play the game. And that's from a Bad Boys Pistons fan. I know its blasphemous, but i think even Zeke would concede that.   If you're too young or jus never seen it, do yourself a favor and YouTube the Bird v Magic rivalry, cuz that will, ever be duplicated. Never! Im not trying to exaggerate, its seriously the best basketball you will ever watch. Period. Nothing comes close. The closest we ever came to since then was the Shaq and Kobe Lakers vs The Duncan, Parker, Ginobili San Antonio Spurs. But that still doesn't even come close, cuz Bird and Magic met in the finals in college and the NBA. Whenever they met or was all on the line. And both dominated their conferences with great teams. Even with freaking Kareem and James worthy and them boys on that team, Magic was Showtime! You watched cuz of Magic and what crazy shit you were gona see..."
"Not really. I've seen enough upvoted comments on here that discredit Vogel saying he got carried to a ring by Lebron, AD, and playoff Rondo. My original point is that he brings up all these ""good coaches"" who've accomplished nothing with the team Drummond has been on just to shit on Kuzma.    But it's easier to shit on Kyle Kuzma because he's Kyle Kuzma, lol"
Kyle Kuzma just a male Arianna Grande
Kyle Kuzma is being punished

"True but the other Lakers need to step up Kyle kuzma 33 mins, 4 points even Caruso had more points than him (18)"
Kyle Kuzma... and for good reason too man is so inconsistent
"If Kyle Kuzma was in anywhere other than LA he'd be seen as a shit player who reached his peak in his rookie season  but since he's in LA he's still seen as a project at that age, somehow"
"&gt;Now seeing him on the Lakers without Bron, I'm getting some deja vu.  You’re getting deja vu from watching Alex Caruso and Kyle Kuzma run point for the Lakers? That’s probably why we’re struggling."

Kyle Kuzma is just JR Smith in disguise
Cause Kyle Kuzma is a bum
You miss 100% of the shots you take  Kyle Kuzma
That was such a clutch block by AD I thought Kuzma was gonna make it for sure off the pure hype boost but then I realized it’s Kyle Kuzma

Kyle Kuzma
The Lakers had a chance to tie the game in the final minute and the shot was taken by...Kyle Kuzma? On a night where he shot 2/11 from the floor and 0/6 from 3?
slim shitty kyle kuzma what u doin
"Kyle Kuzma coming up big for the Trailblazers.  I mean, come on.  Anthony Davis is working his ass off on both ends of the floor in these final minutes with some huge plays and Kuzma just throws away a possession like that with a rushed shot."
HERE COMES KYLE KUZMA
LOL kyle kuzma building a brick house.
wow kyle kuzma is still ice cold lol 1-9 /// 0-5
Kyle Kuzma should be nervous.
"My first thought when I saw that was, ""when did Kyle Kuzma win a championship?"" Then I was like ""Oh yeah last year."" Then I thought, ""...who let him hold the trophy?"" lol."

Gonna say the team that still has Kevin Durant (and Kyrie Irving) is gonna beat the team whose second best scorer is Kyle Kuzma.
our new play maker Kyle Kuzma gonna lead us to the win with his 20 turnover
"- Not American - Not a native English speaker - Doesn't play a brand of basketball that is exciting to casual viewers - Not particularly fit or muscular - Not good looking - Not well embedded in pop culture   Popularity outside of r/nba has very little with how good you are at playing basketball or how many awards are on your BasketballReference page. This is why you guys keep getting confused when news outlets refer to Kyle Kuzma as a ""star""."
"Of course he was right, he's Kyle fucking Kuzma. He's never told a lie."
counterpoint it's Kyle Kuzma nobody really listens to him.
"Hey AD who do you liked playing with, Julius Randle or Kyle Kuzma?"
"Defensive RTG in the context of a team is good, but if you use it on an individual player it can get real sketch. Like for example, Kyle Kuzma over his 4 year career so far has had his DRTG be tied with or better than Jrue Holiday each year. It's really hard to have an accurate one number defensive stat for individuals."
Kyle “Never really been coached in his career” Kuzma
"&gt;Marc Gasol says he didn't know that Kyle Kuzma had publicly asked for him to play more. He says that Kuzma did talk to him privately to say he should play more though, and Marc says he told Kuz he's fine with whatever role the team needs him for.   &gt;More Marc, talking about his and Wes Matthews' up-and-down roles. ""The team's success is everyone's success... We have to kind of forget about the players, situations and individual guys as a whole and think about who we're going to be as a team.""   &gt;Marc says that he doesn't want to talk about individual players on the team, or roles. He just wants to talk about the team. ""It's about the team and how we all help be a better team... When the team does well, we all do well."""
"Kyle Kuzma, keep speaking up"
Kyle Kuzma promoted to head coach
Lakers gotta do better man. How you gonna let Kyle fucking Kuzma be the comparably reasonable one

Remember when he [said this](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/4/26/22404197/lakers-kyle-kuzma-says-nba-playoffs-seeding-doesnt-matter)  Serves you right you bum.
[Buha] Kyle Kuzma: “Andre Drummond fucking sucks and I want him released.”
Yep. Hate Smart but dude got done dirty here by  the refs. Moving screens can happen but the refs need to fucking you know not be blind and stupid and call the moving screen as the reason why marcus ending up in that situation.   If we look Marcus is going for a legitimate swipe at the ball on a drop off pass. Totally fair it was a really stupid play by Nurkic why would you droo off there with a man literally on your dude. Smart is going in a straight line and Nurkic literally steps out to impede him after smart has engaged in a bid for that ball. Moving screen from Nurkic 100%. You do dumb shit dumb shit happens to you. Look at Nurkics leg here too. This isn't a screen this is a trip job at the very least. He's juts his left leg out like that. That's not even a proper attempt at a proper moving screen. That's just tripping somebody.    TLDR fuck smart but Nurkic is an idiot and the refs suck same IQ as Kyle Kuzma - Smart got screwed over by the refs here.
"Besides Pascal and Kyle's phenomenal performance tonight, both team's played awful. Kyle Kuzma and Andre Drummond had a pretty good game though."
Is Kyle Kuzma running for political office now?
"Can’t decide who has the worst hairstyle in the league, Reggie Bullock or Kyle Kuzma.   What y’all think? Lmao"
Kyle Kuzma our lord and saviour
read this as kyle kuzma and cracked up thinking it was a sarcastic title
"In a game with both AD and LeBron, Kyle Kuzma has easily been the best Laker lol"
Kyle Kuzma
Why Kyle Kuzma look like Machine Gun Kelly?
I know there’s gotta be one of Kyle Kuzma somewhere 😂😂
Kyle Kuzma does look like a Walmart brand Slim Shady tbh
Brad Stevens = Pete Buttigieg  Kyle Kuzma = Ellen Degeneres

"Again, I am not a part of the lakers organization. I did not trade anything.    Lonzo and BI were obviously promising young players. The stats back that up. I get it that you don't know what promising young talent looks like being a cavs fan, but if you watch other teams maybe you'll figure it out.    That pick got the lakers Kyle Kuzma, who has been incredibly useful for the lakers. It is a shame they let go of Lopez, but it all worked out."
"fine. kentavious caldwell pope should be no. 1 here. Runner up kyle kuzma. Does that sound more realistic?  Frank Vogel deserves dpoy more than any of them llol - it's clearly a coaching scheme doing the work, not individuals, given they've performed well even without lebron. Implying that anyone on the lakers roster besides ad/lbj should be in the running is crazy"
"It wasn't for tanking purposes, and I always found it amusing when people thought the Lakers were sitting Deng and Mozgov to tank, like those guys were helping the Lakers win too many games or something 😂  The truth was that the Lakers signed Deng cause they needed a small forward (rookie Brandon Ingram was the only other 3 on the roster), but the Lakers failed to realize that Deng was no longer quick enough to play SF, nor was he a good enough shooter to do so in the new pace and space NBA. Deng was exclusively a small ball 4, but the Lakers already had two good, young 4s in Julius Randle and Larry Nance Jr, so there weren't any minutes for Deng there. The Lakers sat Deng cause they were losing anyway, cause him at SF was a disaster, and because they wanted to give Ingram more minutes in the second half of the year.   Then the following year the Lakers added Kyle Kuzma, who was looking very impressive for a rookie, and he just pushed Deng further down the rotation, and effectively out of it. The Lakers had Ingram, Kuzma, Randle and Nance at forward, so all they could do with Deng was offer him garbage time minutes, which would have been insulting for a vet, so instead they agreed he just wouldn't dress at all. But supposedly he stayed ready in case there were injuries.   He did that for a full year and then the Lakers bought him out and stretched him. If they'd bought him out a year earlier his remaining $35 million would have been stretched over 7 seasons, so by waiting that year, instead it was only $15 million stretched over 3 years ($5 million per year)."
"I won't ever forget ppl saying that Danny Green and Kyle Kuzma were better pieces than DeMar, never."

Other than Kyle Kuzma also being Kyle Kuzma personified I completely agree lmao.
"&gt; Alex Caruso, Kyle kuzma, Jared Dudley and a second round pick for Damian lillard.  WTF is that trade? I can make that trade happen in 2k but I don't see portland agreeing to get those three bench guys for a superstar lmao"
"Probably not.  According to r/lakers   They are trading Alex Caruso, Kyle kuzma, Jared Dudley and a second round pick for Damian lillard.  Some are claiming it’s an overpay and Kyle kuzma is untouchable"
You forgot Shanghai Sharks Superstar Kyle Kuzma
He’s just a 7’ Kyle Kuzma
"Social media Ben kind of reminds me of Kyle Kuzma - thinks about himself a lot better than he really is. Simmons still damn great, but I don't think i'd want surround my franchise with players who half ass with their given potential."
The bucks is Kyle Kuzma personified.
I think i rather have Kyle Kuzma than Giannis
"Luka played one of the best playoff series in league history and they still lost in the first round because you have a really tall 150M version of Kyle Kuzma standing in the corner doing nothing on offense while getting torched on the other end.  The Knicks are a ragtag group of castoffs with the lowest payroll in the league and just had the exact same season as the fraudulent Mavericks. COnTeNdER BrO 2 GeNrAtIoNal TaLeNtS BruH DynAStY iN tHe MaKiNG oUt HeRE. Y’all actually believed that shit when you got suckered into the KP hype LMAOOOOO . It’s to the point where you’re too much of a pussy to even rock the Mavs flair so you’re relegated to flairless trolling on this sub like a chump.  #YOUR FAVORITE TEAM GOT TRADE RAPED BY STEVE MILLS LMAOOOOO   Gonna be hilarious to see what kind of value you schmucks can get for that “20 year old all-star” this offseason. Oh wait, you’re not gonna be able to trade him at all LOL."
Joe Harris is a worse player than Kyle kuzma.  I’m completely fucking serious.
"I dont care if the Bucks win this series, Coach Bud needs to get fired. Dude has harden on 1 leg and Joe Harris being a 6'6 kyle kuzma and you're only up single digits"
I also enjoy that part of the game. Lu Dort on Harden was amazing last year. Kyle kuzma is also weirdly good at guarding Kawhi lol
Joe Harris has played like a smaller Kyle Kuzma the last 3 games wtf?
"What? I don't like Lebron. I'm not a Lebron fan. I'm objective enough to know that if the role players can't shoot above 30% as a team (outside of Lebron and Gasol), we're not going to win. I never said Lebron wasn't being a bitch and whining to the refs. But Lebron being a bitch is still 10x more worth than Kyle Kuzma on the court. You a Lakers fan? Do you want Lebron to tackle 4 guys trying to drive into the paint? Like honest question. Sincerely doubt you actually watch the Lakers game to come up with these stupid conclusions like I'm trying to defend Lebron when I'm not"
Joe Harris becoming Kyle Kuzma this series is strange af
"Please remember that if we lose, the NBA is rigged and we were never expected to win anyways. If we win it's the biggest choke ever and kevin durant is not a top 250 player all time and he is basically kyle kuzma when he doesn't have 12 all stars on his team."
Kyle Kuzma is better than Jayson Tatum
"Lebron was terrible, but the Lakers were worse. I'm going to give dumbass Kyle Kuzma more shit for being abysmal everytime he was on the court more than Lebron being a whiny baby. Durant just proved that it's hard to win games by yourself when your teammates can't even knock down open 3's"
This probably my 2nd favorite. My number one is Kyle Kuzma looks like a transvestite Ariana Grande
You really don’t know who Kyle Kuzma is while being on the NBA sub?
Kyle kuzma was snubbed.. this is total balony
Why does Niang play? Guy is worse than Kyle Kuzma
How did Kyle Kuzma get himself to the Jazz?
Orlando is looking for someone who's familiar with Kyle Kuzma for when they inevitably trade for him this summer and give him the keys to the franchise.
The dude who got his ass beat looks like Kyle Kuzma if Oleg from 2 Broke Girls was his stylist.  Also how are you gonna throw that first punch then cower like that. Terrible.
"Lakers, and the trade should happen right now, even if it isn’t trade season yet. Mavs get Kyle Kuzma (whose only allowed to play while sitting down), Lakers get Luka and $100mil from Mark Cuban and are given their 2011 ring in the process. They also only have to win one game against the Canton Charge to be declared the champions for the next 5 seasons. LeBron also is allowed to clown himself 2 times and form a hyper team.   Think that’s pretty fair."
Can we interest you in a slightly used Kyle Kuzma? 👀
"i dont think lebron was, he has ad but who else? mfing kyle kuzma?"
Kyle kuzma last year lmao
Kyle kuzma ecen making a cent is secret overpaid. He’s worth no more than a bag of plain Fritos
"""Anyway here's why we can trade Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and a future second for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Zion Williamson"""
Kyle Kuzma
"mpj doesn't want to switch, doesn't close out, doesn't box out, and doesn't have handles to get to the paint.  to think kyle kuzma let this guy cook the shit out of him."
"1 Joe Harris for the Lakers, please. You can have 1 lightly/moderately used Kyle Kuzma."
"&gt;Lmao you need to stop copying and pasting that absolute nonsense.  Then you need to provide some reasonable argument to counter it.  &gt;Guy had the nerve to say a team that missed the playoffs  If you aren't knowledgeable enough to know that players were injured, and that players often improve with age in general, you really should just remain quiet, rather than embarrassing yourself.  &gt;A team with fucking Kyle Kuzma starting and KCP and Green two of the most inconsistent offensive players in the entire league.  If they traded for Butler instead of Davis, Kuzma isn't starting, and neither are Caldwell-Pope ( probably gone in the Butler trade ) or Green.  They are deep on the bench, where they are some of the best bench players in the league.  Again, if you are totally unaware of the facts of the situation, it would be best to clam up."
Where’s Kyle Kuzma?
Kyle Kuzma
"Jesus, Mike James, that was some Kyle Kuzma type thinking on that fast break"
Lmao you need to stop copying and pasting that absolute nonsense. Guy had the nerve to say a team that missed the playoffs the previous year would’ve easily won it the following year.

Kyle Kuzma is the worst player in basketball
Kyle Kuzma wore a jacket with [mirrors](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EyznzMcUYAAv7bh.jpg:large) embedded in it.  And I think that’s to much irony for me to handle..
"He’s not even close to the worst dressed player in the league, he wears crazy shit but pulls it off, like Russ. Kyle Kuzma dresses like dogshit, he easily should’ve won this."
THT is only better than Kuzma at some basketball related things..   how does he stack up to Kyle when you look at THOTs per 100?
"During the Lakers series, Booker held:  * Dennis Schroder to 27% FG% on 3 of 11 shooting * KCP to 14.3% FG% on 1 of 7 shooting * Markieff Morris to 20% FG% on 1 of 5 shooting * Alex Caruso to 25% FG% on 1 of 4 shooting * Kyle Kuzma to 0% FG% on 0 of 2 shooting  AD, Lebron, and Drummond, obvious mismatches on Booker, were the only players to shoot 50% or above when Booker was the primary defender."
"If Laker fans said Kyle kuzma would swing a series, people would say that they were making excuses for LeBron."
"If executed properly, a bag of chips could to distract an opposing player, and be the catalyst to an unhealthy diet, therefore inadvertently having a bigger defensive impact than Kyle Kuzma without even playing a second on the court."
He's who Kyle Kuzma thinks he is.

"The bubble lakers seemed to be flowing and of course healthy, which is huge. I will also say it seemed they had better big men/back ups. Howard not what he was in his prime but in the bubble he played extremely well in his minutes.   Kyle Kuzma... he doesnt seem to step up that often.   So yeah, every team can improve but the Lakers are kinda prone to injuries, which sucks because AD is crazy good when healthy."
"Kyle Kuzma is like if you took the wildness of Clarkson, and took away his shooting ability and IQ."
kd looking like kyle kuzma
Did Kyle Kuzma clone himself 10 times and put on 5 Bucks jerseys and 5 Nets jerseys?
"Yeah, they’re going to get Kyle, the guy who always takes the highest contract offer, for an MLE. Then, they will convince the Spurs to give the rights for Derozan for Kuzma and Trez, while signing Kuzma and Trez to 3 or 4 year contracts. I’m also pretty sure sign and trade has to be 1 for 1"
donovan learnt that from kyle kuzma
KD is from Marlyand bro. Lebron is from Cleveland. And Kyle Kuzma is from Michigan.
"For more hot takes, further down the draft class there's Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Kyle Kuzma"
The thing tho is Middleton gets trashed every year in the playoffs because that’s when people finally see him play. Giannis may have been a 2 time MVP but I don’t think people watch the Bucks enough to see the rest of the team play   And that’s not to say Middleton is bad because he clearly isn’t. But if the majority of the people watching the playoffs are just now seeing him for the first time then they probably think he’s like a Kyle Kuzma or something   So of course he gonna get trashed because now people are like “I finally see this guy and I’m not impressed”. They have the right to not be impressed but I don’t think he should get as trashed as Twitter is gonna do to him
"Kevin Love's trading value is somewhere in the Kyle Kuzma range, if not worse. I wouldn't want him as my team's 2nd fiddle."
Almost as good as Lakers' 3rd superstar Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma couldn't see the floor with the Jazz
"So? We still have better assets than your team. You're stuck with an aging LeBron, Anthony Day-to-Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schroeder, with no picks. We have Wiggins who turned into a 2-way player, James Wiseman with potential still, the Minnesota pick and the 14 pick this draft. 😆"
"Not related to match thread, but just realized something insane.    If you swap first letter of name and surname of Kyle Kuzma, his name would still be Kyle Kuzma. Wow"
Could have sworn it would’ve been Kyle Kuzma.. maybe next year
Kyle Kuzma&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jordan before ‘91
Tobias Harris is who Kyle Kuzma thinks he is
the answer is *never* Kyle Kuzma.
Access to Kyle Kuzma Instagram
true but they be bringing up quotes that are not even talking shit. Like the player will say sum “yeah I just want to come out and give it my all.” Then there will be a Reddit post saying Kyle “come out and give it all my all” Kuzma drops 0 points in 29 minutes of playing. lol I kinda get it actually
"Your team got exposed for the frauds they are lol, you have Kyle Kuzma of the east on your team, my team has one of the best young stars in the league and are looking to have a bright future, you about to sign Jimmy 'Stupidly locked in' Butler to a big contract and stay getting exposed lol, LeBron made your pathetic franchise relevant"
"Well if anyone knows about player development its a Lakers fan. Look at how you guys developed Lonzo, BI, Hart, Randle, Jordan Clarkson even Larry Nance. At least Kyle Kuzma is still looking like a stud"
Kyle Kuzma is good
Kyle kuzma on the way
"&gt;If the Lakers genuinely believed he was a decent role player on a decent contract, then why in the world would they be looking to trade him?  To improve the team?   It's not like Kuzma is expected to be star or anything like that with that salary. Let's look at the other players in the same range. Justise Winslow 13M, Kennard 12.7M, Cory Joseph 12.6M, Terence Ross 12.5M. Even if you think that Kyle Kuzma isn't as good as some of these players, he's not far off.   Plus, it's a 2+1 deal. So, an expiring contract after 1 season. it wouldn't be dead weight on your cap space either."
The top 2 candidates will both be on the Spurs: Keldon Johnson and Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma
I. Andre Drummond 2. Kyle Kuzma 3. Ben simmons
"Kyle Kuzma. He’s really good, probably the carry for the Lakers. He’s young so you’ll get a lot of years from Him. You might want to learn some Chinese if he ends up going to Shanghai. He’ll stomp everyone there. The redemption journey to come back to the NBA would be sick."
"They way people talk about this team make it seem as if players like Jeff Teague, Kyle Kuzma or Tyler Herro or on this team. When I’m reality we have fucking KD, Dame, Draymond, Tatum and LaVine. No other team has even half the talent we have"
"&gt;Serge Ibaka wrapped a giant scarf around his neck, went to battle with certified Fit Legend™ Kyle Kuzma, and emerged a victor.  This gives me ""hello, fellow kids, I too am hip"" vibes"
Don't they kind of need KCP though?  I would think they can't afford to lose another wing unless they get back a player on the level of Kyle Lowry.  Do you think the Raps would want Kuzma and KCP in a S&amp;T if they can't get much draft capital in return?
kyle kuzma
Boy all these Lakers fans gonna be real sour when THT turns out to be the next Kyle Kuzma.
he is literally mj one night and kyle kuzma the next  he's extremely on or off
Chill on Kyle “Traded for Dame Lilliard” Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma for Terrence Ross. Discuss.
Where's that flow chart that shows Khris Middleton going from Kyle Kuzma to Michael Jordan? We need one for Jrue where he goes from Eric Bledsoe to Gary Payton
Saw laker fans calling him Kyle Kuzma with a better bag back during the clippers series lol
I hope he doesn't play like Kyle Kuzma the next game. According to the cycle its due.
"How does Stephen Curry, #7, #14, and your unprotected 2022 1st for Kyle Kuzma and Jared Dudley sound?"
It's fun cuz you have Middleton on the same team who is either prime Jordan or Kyle Kuzma
That’s summer league MVP Kyle Kuzma you’re talking about bub
"Starts each series off like Kyle Kuzma,  ends each series like Prime Michael Jordan"
Middleton evolved from Kyle Kuzma in the 1st quarter to a prime Jordan
"Middleton chose to play like Kyle Kuzma today, instead of Prime Jordan."
From Prime MJ to Kyle Kuzma by Khris Middleton
Middleton either plays like prime Michael Jordan or Kyle Kuzma
Khris Kyle kuzma Middleton tonighg
Kyle kuzma?  Jk don't kill me
Kyle Kuzma has more Instagram followers than Pat Mahomes
"NBA easy  We have mid-level players like Kyle Kuzma with 5m IG followers ... He has more than their best player (Patrick Mahomes, 4.5m)"
This is a plus for Kyle Kuzma
Prime Kyle Kuzma and 2018 Lebron take down the Warriors

Lakers front office calling up Sixers front office like...   Lakers: So I hear you're shopping Ben Simmons.   Sixers: What are you offering?   Lakers: I can offer you Kyle Kuzma   Sixers: *hangs up*   Lakers: So I take it that's a no then?
Oh shit Kyle Kuzma 😭
"Kyle Kuzma is a solid player, just not worth $13 million on a contender. Could help 90% of the league though."
Gotta make room for Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma
"But you’re willing to hold mid-late first round picks against a guy? If you get a good player there, maybe you scouted well, but you’re also just lucky. If you thought the picks they made were absolutely dumb at the time, fine. But if it’s a hindsight, I think that’s a pretty soft criticism. Besides, the Kyle Kuzmas and Jarrett Allens of the world aren’t changing their fortune. If anything, the criticism here is not turning those assets into something bigger than a mid round first picks.   This team needs a better star. They might even need a star better than Dame. Most championship teams feature a star better than him. The Suns would be an exception to that, but look at who has dominated the title picture. Lebron has been somewhere near the best player in the league. Curry was an MVP the year the Warriors went and was maybe the best player in the league over the Warriors title run. Kawhi was a top 6 or so player over the past few years. That’s the usual level at which you win titles. Kuzma or your good role player drafted at 27 doesn’t get you there. You need to hit big.   Obviously you don’t give him credit if he’s missing on these draft picks, but this is idea that it wouldn’t be an issue if they drafted better is pretty bogus to me."
"I think it's a tossup honestly. I wouldn't be shocked if he gives them through the All-Star Break, and then assesses his future with the team. I just don't see him staying on this team if they make zero moves.  What sucks for the Blazers is that if Oshley could draft this wouldn't be an issue. They had the 15th, 20th and 26th pick in 2017 and managed to come out of the draft without a single player as good as Kyle Kuzma, who went 27th that draft. Could have had Jarrett Allen, John Collins and Kuzma."
that’s nba champion kyle kuzma to you
"My guy, we both know the Blazers really want Kyle Kuzma and a 20208 2nd   No typo"
Andre Drummond and Kyle Kuzma coming in hot. Plus they don't need a return ticket
Laker fans are delusional but so is everyone else lmao. Wiggins is your Kyle Kuzma. Throw Juan while you’re at it lol
Lakers fans be like:  Best I can do is Kyle Kuzma. (If I was a Lakers fan I'd trade Kuzma too)
"You mean you don’t want to lose your franchise player for Kyle Kuzma, KCP and the 22nd overall pick?"
Any take involving Kyle kuzma being a great player. Dudes a bench wing and an average one at that.
"All-hated team should also have: Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Rudy Gobert, Grayson Allen, Ben Simmons, Andre Drummond, Jae Crowder, Kyle Kuzma  All-loved team should have: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Derrick Rose, Alex Caruso, Jarrett Allen, Boban Marjanovic"
"They should pick a role player who worked with the coaching staff last season so it's an easier transition: Eric Gordon, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White, or Malcolm Brogdon."
"I know we’re all for jokes, but realistically player wise.. what would your team trade for Kyle Kuzma?"
"This was the best example of Middleton playing either as Prime MJ or Kyle Kuzma, no in between"
The Law of Middleton: Either Michael Jordan or Kyle Kuzma. There is no in between.
Kyle Kuzma (jk he actually hasnt done that bad for a 27th pick)
"Khris Middleton is either Kyle Kuzma or Kobe Bryant, I swear"
Kyle Kuzma
"Dejounte Murray breaks out a la Julius Randle this season and gets the Spurs back into the playoffs  Timberwolves make the playoffs  CP3 leaves Phoenix but they're still really good, win ~55 games  The Pelicans are still mediocre and Zion gets increasingly sad  Knicks don't replicate the magic from last season and are bang average going close to .500  Raptors bounce back and get home court advantage in the first round  Lillard starts the season in Portland but things go south quick and they end up being rather bad, winning ~35 games  Kyle Kuzma gets traded and has a borderline AS season, earning him the MIP"
"*Kyrie Irving will win MVP*  Not really seeing it but because the MVP can be a popularity contest, who knows - maybe Kyrie hires a great promotional firm and can keep fooling people into thinking he's on the same level as Harden and KD.      *CJ McCollum will be an MVP candidate if he gets moved*  Has there ever been a player that's never made an all-star team and gets mentioned as an MVP candidate?      *Russ or Beal will not be wearing a Wizards uniform by the trade deadline*  I could see it      *Kyle Kuzma becomes a legit 3rd option in another team*  Is it a good team? I could see him playing well on a team like the Warriors or Nuggets where they've got some players already. But I don't know about 3rd option.      *Brandon Ingram will be in a Warriors uniform*  You've got me torn on this one. The scoring and the size would be nice but I'm not sure how they could convince NoLa to part with him. I like Wiggins but he doesn't really move the needle.      *Grayson Allen will be an All Star*  Well, it's always good to end with something memorable - like a punchline."
You forgot Kyle Kuzma
Lets throw in Kyle “I could average 25 a game” Kuzma
With a Kyle kuzma flair no less
But he's not taller than 6'8 Kyle Kuzma.
Ben Simmons is like an equal trade with Kyle kuzma
Kyle Kuzma and tht for Simmons
"None of them were ending up there lol. Let's not pretend like LA was such some surefire place for stars. We had failed to get stars for *years*. PG was even salty that we didn't trade for him iirc. I feel bad for all of the people who learned photoshop to put Lakers jerseys on the stars they wanted/thought would sign lmao.   The fact still stands that they don't trade for AD if LeBron doesn't go there. The only reason they trade for him is to contend, to go into win-now mode. Whenever LeBron goes to a team, they go into win-now mode. There's no reason to trade the farm and gut the entire roster except for Kyle Kuzma for AD if they can't contend. They were on the ""develop the rookies"" path until LeBron showed up."
"Kyle Kuzma,Eric Bledsoe,CJ Elleby,Keljin Blevins,Jahlil Okafor,Mason Plumlee,Austin Rivers,Marvin Bagley,Jeff Green,Udonis Haslem,Kevin Love,Andre Drummond,Lebron James,Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan."
"Dennis Schroeder + the rights to his ""That's tuff 🔥💯"", Andre Drummond, Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma and a 2063 second round pick"
"Pretty sure there was thing called an AD Injury that happened to derail the Lakers run.  Funny thing about the US team is that if an All-Star gets injured (let’s say Lillard), you just swap him out with another All-Star (like Beal). You don’t have to worry about swapping out AD with Kyle Kuzma or Markeiff Morris."
Think they need Kyle Kuzma to save them
Man had a wide open layup just like the play in game and he made a Kyle Kuzma esque pass
No one is stopping Kyle Kuzma. Maybe Ben Simmons ore Julius Randle? But I can't see anyone topping Kyle Kuzma scoring 30 points a game with the GUANGDONG TIGERS! NI HAO NI HAO NI HAO
"Kennard's a decent young player. His contract isn't *that* terrible, he's pretty much making Kyle Kuzma money and no doubt in my mind a bottom 15 team in the league would take either one of those two without a first attached to give them a significant chance with no pressure."
Somewhere chillin with Kyle Kuzma with models and cocaine.
"Great take, tell you what. We'll (Lakers) do this for ya, we'll send AD to you guys in a 3 way trade where we get Dame and Steph, also you can take Kyle Kuzma and Montrez and Portland will get cash considerations. Boom, deal of the century right there..... (Obviously I'm pretending to be a Lakers fan praying for any sort of trade that can get rid of Kuzma and win them a ring)"
All this to stop Kyle kuzma. Pathetic
"wow, so you think Kyle Kuzma could get traded for Klay? Nice me too."
Kyle Kuzma and THT for Dame and a first /s
Why would Portland say yes to this trade? Kyle Kuzma is right here. JK.
Dennis Schroeder and Kyle Kuzma have entered the chat
When two good players are put together one is almost always going to outshine the other. If Tatum is on the Suns probably only one of develops into the player they are now. The situation you are in drastically changes how you grow.   Kyle Kuzma was looking like a perennial allstar before LeBron joined the Lakers and when AD got there and Kuzma became the 3rd option his development got even worse. It’s safe to say if he was on a team where he was the main guy he would have developed into an allstar but that’s not the hand he was dealt.
"“Kyle Kuzma, YYOOOOUUUUU’RRREEEE FFFIIIIRRRRREEEEDDDD!”"
I keep Kyle Kuzma and tell AD to play center so we can stop starting these shat centers
kyle kuzma ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
"C: Darko Milicic  PF: Anthony Bennet  SF: Kyle Kuzma  SG: Adam Morrison  PG: Raymond Felton  yep, no regrets"
&gt;intense hate boner  It’s almost as intense as the hate for Ben Simmons and Kyle Kuzma I’ve seen too
KYLE KUZMA. Jk  Jaren Jackson Jr. probably.
Kyle Kuzma
Obviously Kyle Kuzma is the key to making this nonsense work
"The answer to this is always Kyle Kuzma. Right? Right, kuz? Please?"
Kyle Kuzma!
"DS, Drummond, and Kyle Kuzma are going to lose their minds. LeGM should send them packing.   I don’t think THT is that good to keep either, but honestly he’s tried his best in spite of all the pressure, and I’ll always respect that."
So what I’m hearing from this article is tht as the centerpiece then adding Kyle kuzma and kcp for matching salary and then the 22 pick and one of the 27 or 28 pick. Sounds like a great package for someone 5x worse than lillard
Kyle Kuzma for Stephen A. Who says no?
"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."
Veteran Kyle Kuzma
It feels like Kyle kuzma is pretty much universally disliked at the moment as well lmao
on the lakers he was like kyle kuzma. He played next to kobe so... he was just there.
Calling him average is like calling Kyle Kuzma a superstar
You’re suggesting...Kyle Kuzma...play SHOOTING guard ?
Kid looks like Kyle Kuzma
I still wanna know who the Kyle Kuzma of the 90s was tho
kyle kuzma
"Who was the Kyle Kuzma of the 90s, I bet this guy stanned him over MJ"
"Sucks that life is that way.  Same case with NBA players.   You could have TJ Warren and Kyle Kuzma set up booths beside eachother, and everyone's lining up for Kuzma."
"Kyle Kuzma, hate that guy…"
"I dislike Lebron because of how he portrays himself on the court. I think the entire ""Lebron doesn't have a killer-instinct mentality"" argument is bullshit. But Lebron has consistently shown that it's more embarrassing to try and lose than it is to physically give up on your teammates even if they're playing shitty.     And then he tries to claim himself as the GOAT yet the GOAT is somehow who is supposed to try and defy against all odds instead of giving up. Like yes, I get that Kyle Kuzma sucks ass, but at least show some more heart. Play like you did in 2015 when Kyrie and Love went down.   I don't care about Lebron being ranked higher than Kobe all-time. I do have a problem when people try to rank him above Kobe during 2008-2010 despite being exposed in the 2007 finals for not having a jumpshot aside from how shitty that Cavs roster was. Just look at my comment history where some Utah fan is trying to argue that if you ""swap Kobe and Lebron"" in 2008-2010, it's not even a question. Lmao"
Jeannie Buss and Kyle Kuzma
Feel like if you come to the lakers you can be pretty excited because being good here boosts your popularity a lot  Example: Kyle Kuzma has more followers than Bradley Beal and he was just solid. Imagine being an actual star
"Open Letter to LeBron  Dear LeBron,  I wrote you but still ain't callin'   I left my insta, my e-mail, and my cell phone at the bottom   I sent two DMs back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em   They probably got auto-filtered or somethin'   Sometime I'll dribble and send you the videos when I drop 'em   But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's Kyle Kuzma?   Bet he's a lot better than playing with Kyrie, he was a losea   It's so unfair that he's still a hoopa and Myers ain't   Why'd he have to get cancelled?   I read about your high ankle too I'm sorry   I'll have a friend kill Solomon Hill if you wanna   I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan   I even snuck into the bubble to watch you dunk on Bam   I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man   I don't even mind the shit you did with China even though that was wack   Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,   Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan     This is \[LAL\] Stan"
"Here’s a special mention:  Kyle “3RD STAR” Kuzma is hated by his own people. He fits into that Pat Bev hate where you’re not relevant but you find ways for people to hate you. In this case, Kuz really rubs a lot of people the wrong way especially Lakers fans. When you carry yourself as a 6’9 Ellen Degeneres playing like a jackass thinking you’re Kobe, heh tough luck especially when the org and the fans have championship aspirations. Boy just pulled a Tragic Bronson in the Finals falling down and LeBron didn’t even help him get up. He’s so hated that Laker fans put up a petition for him to not get a ring when the Lakers win the championship.  The hate relative to skill is just extremely high on Kuz. You could say he’s an efficient hating machine, the perfect scapegoat. Wish he was as efficient in shooting the ball."
Kyle kuzma is going to be an all star level player in a crap team

"Kyle Kuzma can ascend into a Top 30 player given he’s the first option of a team. Maybe if he gets redrafted to an expansion team and he’s the best player on that team, he’’d put up Devin Booker “empty stats” numbers"
kyle kuzma 3rd team all nba
"If Lebron was the GOAT, he would've gotten us past the 1st round at least. Nets would've rolled through everyone if they were healthy regardless unless Kyle Kuzma actually stepped up"
I was intrigued until Kyle Kuzma being an allstar was suggested.
"Atlanta, Sonics/OKC late 2000s, Suns, I'd say Sixers are better off today than being a perennial 7-8 seed as well  Also I can say with confidence that Kyle Kuzma is not taking a leap to lead the Wizards to be title contenders...  EDIT: for the record I don't think every team should bottom out and tank if they aren't contenders but if you can't realistically make the 2nd round with your core, don't have a legit young talent or two with star potential who hasn't peaked (Zion and Ingram, Ja and JJJ, etc) and can't draw FAs like the Knicks, Bulls, Heat, Lakers, etc it's the best path to finding a star (or more)"
Kyle kuzma??
Fox putting up good stats is the equivalent of Kyle Kuzma putting up 19 PPG on a losing team and people thinking he's good. Don't fall for it
"He split his nuts and should’ve been out for 2 months. Our starting 5 played a total of 22 games that season. Would it have been better for Lebron to make the playoffs as an 8th seed to get swept by the KD Warriors with Kyle Kuzma, Lance, and Rondo since everyone else was injured?"

"Money. You’re never going to make as much on endorsements in okc or even San Antonio than you would in LA NY Miami etc. big market teams have big market money, massive fanbases and a lot of revenue can come through. I mean really Kyle kuzma Alex caruso and fucking tacko fall were in the all star charts. Even Anthony Davis who basically got fucked previous years simply because New Orleans existed. You get a ton more exposure and ability for endorsements being the 2nd 3rd or 4th best on a big market team compared to say idk Minnesota. They aren’t bad places but to maximize profits you’re damn sure not gonna want to be in Toronto if you aren’t super max worthy"
"Yeah, but before he got hurt he was really good for a long time. And the team that drafted him turned him into a (pretty good) year of Russell Westbrook and then Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the No. 22 overall pick in the 2021 NBA draft. Not bad considering the contract."
"Lou Williams wasn't traded for the pick that became Kyle Kuzma. Kuzma was part of the Mozgov/D'Lo trade with Brooklyn. Lou Williams was traded for a pick that was then traded to Utah for the picks that were used on Josh Hart and Thomas Bryant.  Trading Lou Williams was also not a ""tanking"" move. It did make the Lakers worse in the short term, but Lou Williams was much older than the rest of the young core, and was seen at the time as someone they should probably try to get something for before he went downhill with age. Ironically he went on to play probably the best ball of his career after that in his early 30s, but that was unexpected.   That trade was about getting a 1st round pick for Lou while he still had time left on his contract rather than thinking the Lakers were too good with him (they were horribly bad either way). When the Lakers traded Lou they were 19-39 and [had just been trashed by an awful Suns team, losing by 36 points.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201702150PHO.html) At the rate the Lakers were winning with Lou (32% of the time), that put them on a 26 win pace with him. Without him they finished the season with 26 wins, meaning they were no worse without him.   The Lou Williams trade was not done by Mitch and Jim, as they'd just been fired, but rather was the first move from Magic and Pelinka, as they began the process of trying to dig the Lakers out of the hole Mitch and Jim had put the team in. The Lakers were awful and capped out when Mitch and Jim were fired. 18 months later they were a 35 win team with two max cap slots. The Lakers were just really awful under Mitch and Jim, even though they were trying to be good."
"I agree with you that Deng and Mozgov being benched were definitely for the better when considering how bad they were for us. I will say though that trading Lou Williams was definitely seen at the time as a move to help us tank, even by our own fanbase. Look back at our own threads when we traded him, everyone pretty much agreed that it was better for our pick. Although it's not like Lou Williams was moving the needle towards winning basketball for us anyway. I think it comes down to personal opinion considering there were other benefits to the Lou Will trade especially since we got a pick from it that turned into Kyle Kuzma."

Maybe the Summer League MVP isn't cursed after all. I could've sworn Kyle Kuzma got one. Or was it Lonzo
"&gt;Kyle Kuzma ... didn't play to his potential in NBA.  He was literally the 27th pick. He has shown he can score but not consistently, and on top of that, he doesn't have a high IQ. This is exactly what we should have expected of him, but Laker fans and talking heads overrated the shit out of him when the rest of the young core got traded."
Convince me Green isn't Kyle Kumza.  JK. We like Kuzma because he is from Flint.
Kyle Kuzma was drafted in 2017...
Oh man. Kyle kuzma part 2 (in terms of the anatagonizing a city. Not in terms of talent)
My head canon is that Pelinka always greeted Kuzma Ann Perkins style  👉Kyle Kuzma👉
"Per The Ringer   &gt; Multiple reports have indicated that the Lakers are interested in a deal for Buddy, and with fewer than 24 hours until the 2021 draft, multiple league sources say **Los Angeles has stepped up its efforts by adding the no. 22 pick to a deal** that’d include Montrezl Harrell and Kyle Kuzma or Kentavious Caldwell-Pope."
Summer League MVP Kyle Kuzma would like a word.
"The solution is simple: if you're Philly, he doesn't have a no-trade clause (or at least I can't find one) so trade him wherever the hell you want.    The solution is also complicated: who the hell wants to trade $30mil worth of assets for a dude that will only make 20 shots outside of 10ft for an entire season and contribute less than 10 ppg in the playoffs on the same usage rate as Kyle Kuzma? Who the hell is especially going to make that trade by giving up a ""James Harden-level package"" like they were asking for?   If he's unwilling to actually use that offseason shooting we keep seeing every summer and Philly doesn't see ideal postseason results, they're probably going to end up buying him out. Not worth keeping him on the books."

Kyle Kuzma was the summer league MVP and couldn't do shit 3 years later. Some people even said he's better than Tatum during his rookie season.   Trae Young played like shit in SL and to be fair, with his stature and gamestyle, he did scream ""bust"" coming into the league. Now he lead his squad in the WCF and took the Champs to 7 games.

"There are issues with the stats you're posting, but to be fair to you I was vague, so I'll get more specific.  I've come to determine Win Shares proper to be a worthless metric, as it tends to broadly overrate certain stats, and I remember a couple seasons ago it making out JaVale and Dwight's WS/48 to be near that of LeBron's.  BPM and its accumulative form in VORP are the best publicly-available all-in-one metric that I know of that only uses box stats, but it still only uses box stats.  TS, FTR, and TOV% are going to overlap for the most part with BPM/VORP.  The advanced metrics I've come to most regard are RPM and on-off per 100 possessions.  RPM's calculation is secret, at last check, but I believe that it predominantly uses +/-, and seemed pretty accurate with teams or players I've followed closely.  For instance it shows LeBron as having a much higher number than AD the past two seasons, which is accurate for anyone who watched the Lakers a lot, and you'd never be able to tell by looking at their box stats (which make them look mostly equal).  It's also made out Steph Curry to be especially good, and it showed when the Dubs last season won something like 60% of their games with him and went 2-8 without.  OOP100 can be jank even with an entire season's worth of games, and for role players generally, but DeRozan's predominantly played starter minutes and has been in the league a long time, and I'll be looking at a large sample size for him.  DeRozan's RPM the last 3 seasons in reverse-order is:  -0.83, -1.39, and -0.28.  His career OOP100 regular season is -2.8, with the last 3 seasons of 61-77 games each was even worse at -4.6 average.  That's.... awful.  Kyle Kuzma has a better OOP100.  Based on these numbers, the dude's not even properly worth an MLE to most teams.  I've barely watched the guy, but apparently there's a big empty-stats aspect to his game.  We weren't really arguing about Lowry, but I'll look up his like-numbers anyway.  His RPM the last 3 seasons is 4.02, 5.21, and 5.88.  Those are basically superstar numbers.  I won't cite his career OOP100 since he's getting old, but the last three seasons average:  +4.2 in 169 games.    DeMar's health has been better and he's younger, but +/- advanced metrics show that the two players that the two players are nowhere near each other in on-court impact, that Lowry's probably worth his new contract, and DeMar might be the most overrated player in the game."
"Jalen Green just went #2 in a stacked draft because he averaged 18 PPG as a 18 year old vs grown men in the G-League. He isn't Kevin Knox or Kyle Kuzma, summer league is just confirming what we already know."
Kyle kuzma too right ? There is a big chance hé becomes really good but people need to slow with the rookies
No it’s not. Every reporter will recognize Kyle Kuzma because he got on a jacket or a hoodie or something.
lmao i remember kuzma not being recognized as kyle kuzma in his own basketball camp
Kyle Kuzma first time all star
Dude got pushed by Kyle Kuzma to get into position
Kyle Kuzma makes his first All-Star appearance
Tho in the 2021-2022 season Kevin Durant is tied with Kyle Kuzma in points so far. Borderline all-star might be a stretch for KD.
Kyle Kuzma isn’t likely to win because he’s put up decent stats before but i wouldn’t be surprised if he did something like    18/7/5 on 47/38/80 shooting
THT the next Kyle Kuzma lmfaoo
kyle kuzma 3rd team all-nba this year
"You're making absolutely no sense. Clarkson is a bad defender. This was known when the Jazz offered him a contract. The Jazz decided to get offensive-minded players to go along with Gobert because he's their center piece. You lose all credibly when comparing Clarkson to Harden, Curry, and Durant. Those are superstars getting paid the max. Clarkson is getting paid roughly the same amount as Kyle Kuzma"
"As if eye test ""Kyle Kuzma and Tyler Herro will be a perrenial all star"" is any better"
We’ve seen how the Bucks look replacing Khris with Kyle Kuzma every night Khris plays like he’s Kyle Kuzma
Not sure how LeBron gonna win without his man Kyle Kuzma tho.
"Kyle Kuzma. I think that his game can improve a lot if he is allowed to play a bit more fast and loose than LeBron prefers. This being said, I don't think that he will get much run in Washington because they have a logjam of players in his natural positions. He could be a steal for an expansion team."
11. Curry  12. KD  13. Oscar Robertson  14. Moses Malone  15. Karl Malone  16. Dirk  17. Dr J  18. KG   19. Kyle Kuzma  20. Elgin Baylor  Feeling Pretty good about this 11-20 squad!
Steph Curry  Jason Kidd  Devin Booker  Blake Griffin  Kyle Kuzma  ...or are you going by blood quantum laws or something?
"Rich Paul: ""The minute he signs that max deal this summer, we're gonna demand he get traded to LA for Melo and Kyle Kuzma.""  Random fan: ""But Kuzma's not even o...""  Rich Paul: ""I said Kyle Kuzma, damn it!"""
"Right now its 50/50 fkk or fkl  Fuck Kyle Kuzma Fuck Kyle Lowery  We hate Kyles!   Kuzma is due to an off hand comment he made about being a no one in LA is better than being a star in Orlando, and Lowry is because of a dirty play on Aaron Gordon in the bubble playoffs where Gordon missed most of the rest of the series due to it."
"They did an incredible job.  Wall hadn't played in 2 years, reached his max already as a player, and they got that for a guy who was coming off an injury but is always at least a force and a draw and you never have to worry about him mentally competing.  Then they essentially took Wall and a protected first into  Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and the Lakers' No. 22    The only losers in this are the Rockets. Which under the new owner slowly disengrated a team he inherited in the first place to now chasing off a team President, GM, Ass Gms, Coach, Ass Coach, STars and Role players and ended last year in the bottom of the seeds and almost set a record for multiple losses in a row.   They at least have a yougn direction now, but wow Houston fans got Dollar Value Dolan.  Same Bullshit and Ego, but the reality show version with all talk and no action."
Kyle Kuzma  Anyone on the Magic or Kings
"Charlotte &gt; Washington &gt; Toronto  Charlotte could only get better despite their losses. If Gordon Hayward stays healthy throughout the season, the team could definitely build some chemistry and be a solid 6-8th seed. A lot of their success would depend on how much better LaMelo would be.   Washington lost a lot of continuity after the Westbrook trade though it would be interesting to see how Dinwiddie, KCP, Kuzma, and Montrezl would fit in with the team. Rui’s development might be stunted if he competes with Kuzma for pt. It’s really hard to see them being a solid playoff contender and I don’t think Bradley Beal will be having a better season. Could compete for a play-in spot if they don’t have any major setbacks.   A lot of people be sleep on the Raptors after a disorderly season not even being able to have games in their homecourt. That being said, securing the play-in spot seems dim for a team that just lost Kyle Lowry and are looking to shop (I think?) Paskal Siakam. They still do have a lot of good players like OG, and Troy Barnes looks promising. They might surprise people, might not, definitely not a better team on paper than Washington or Charlotte."

&gt; Kyle Kuzma  ???
"He got a future first round pick, a 2021 first round pick (Isaiah Jackson), a couple of seconds, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Montrezl Harrell (on an expiring contract). It may not be a massive haul but it’s a pretty damn good one for one of the worst contracts in sports."
"As I commented in another post, his stats are almost identical to Kyle Kuzma's. And Kuzma is making 10m a year less. This is a massive overpay."
Elite is a giant stretch. Good.  And he was averaging the same amount of assists as Kyle Kuzma.
"For fun:  Aaron Gordon: $23m  10 PPG, 6 RPG, 2 APG, 56 TS%  Kyle Kuzma: $13m  12 PPG, 7 RPG, 2 APG, 54 TS%"
"Somebody asked a year or two ago if the Lakers would trade Kyle Kuzma for Kyrie Irving, and he was serious."
I didn't know Kyle kuzma was that efficient.
Kyle kuzma
"Yeah no idea why people are always picking on Kuzma. He’s done excellently for himself considering where he was drafted.  Look at a selection of players drafted above him in 2018 and where they are now: - Tony Bradley : on a 1yr deal with the Bulls - Caleb Swanigan : out of the league in 2020 - Anžejs Pasečņiks : waived by Wizards in early 2021 - Tyler Lydon : waived by Kings in 2019 - Terrance Ferguson : waived by Knicks in early 2021 - Harry Giles : making $1.8m with Clippers, contract expires in 2022. - Justin Patton : waived by Rockets in early 2021, now playing in Israel - DJ Wilson : currently a UFA as of Aug 2021 - TJ Leaf : currently a UFA as of Aug 2021  Important to keep these things in context.  Kyle Kuzma is not a bust. He is a success."
It’s pretty clear that Kyle kuzma doesn’t have a great mindset for the nba
- Ben Simmons  - Shaq (to a certain degree. watch his interview with Kobe)  - Ron Artest  - JR Smith  - Starbury (at least when he was with the NBA)  - Kyle Kuzma  - Prime Dwight Howard  - Latrell Sprewell  - Wilt Chamberlain (was more concerned with extracurriculars and stats more than titles and being a good teammate. He could’ve been more better than he already was)  - A lot of the 70’s players. (Jesus that’s a lot of coke.)
Kyle Kuzma. Probably but anymore tho
"James Harden, take away his free throws and he's not super impressive, sure he's got handles, but he relies on getting fouled.  Giannis Antetekumpo, his first few years all he had was height and speed, he didn't do anything overly impression to me, I will admit he is getting better now that he's rounding out his game.  Fucking Zion, he was just way too hyped up, then to win rookie of the year when he barely played any games his rookie year was just stupid and completely undeserved.  Kyle Kuzma, he's not that great, let's be real. People always try to defend him but he hasn't done anything that hasn't been done before hundreds of times.  Steph Curry, I will admit that his 3 point shots are stupid good, but he doesn't have much else. He gets swallowed in the paint, and all of his handles are just to open up a 3 pointer. Take those away and he's not at all that."
MJ never had to deal with Kyle Kuzma

"There were individual forwards who initiated the offense before Nellie, like Rick Barry on the Warriors.  But those situations were more about the individual player having playmaking skills. Nellie was the first coach to really implement the point forward as a system.   When Pressey tested, Marques Johnson took over as the point forward. The backup point was another forward.  That's different than say, the Lakers. LeBron plays point forward, but it's not the whole Lakers system. When LeBron rested, it wasn't Kyle Kuzma running the offense, it was a regular PG like Shroeder. Or like how when Luka sits, Jalen Brunson runs the offense instead of another forward."

"A) progress isn’t linear. There are things you and I are better at than our grandparents but there’s a shit ton they could do we’d have no clue where to start.  B) there’s tons in f dudes who can’t dribble with their off hand. Hell, khris Middleton can barely dribble with either hand but that doesn’t stop him from being a deadly shooter. Nobody in the league these days can play in the post like they did 20 years ago. Hell, other than distance shooting where has all this extra skill manifested itself? They’ve changed so many rules to make it easier to score. Guys didn’t all suddenly become so much more skilled, scoring became easier.  It’s a stupid argument. Jordan, shaq, Robinson, zeke, chuck, magic, Larry legend shiiiiiit the assist record is still held by Scott skiles, nobody handles like white chocolate and cwebb changed the game with his passing. Those are easy because they were stars sure but if you’re saying average guys now (like say Kyle Kuzma) are better than average guys then because of skill I’ll tell you straight up Chris child’s would bust his ass harder than he busted Kobe’s chops. You really telling me Stanley Johnson is more skilled? Cmon now.  It’s a dumb argument."
Kyle kuzma is the same as jayson Tatum
Kyle Kuzma is paying random sites to stay in news.
&gt; insane exposure from playing there  If Kyle Kuzma didn't play for the Lakers he probably would be one of the candidates for 'Who he play for?' and Chuck would probably guess his team wrong.
"listen an inside source told me he actually said fuck the Lakers, KYLE KUZMA OUT"
He’s not overrated. But Kyle Kuzma fucking sucks.
Ok I'm pretty low on Russ but he's not nearly as bad as Kyle freaking Kuzma lmao
There was a post saying Kyle Kuzma was a decent defender against Kawhi Leonard because his reaction time was so slow to fall for any of his fakes

"Kyle ""better than Tatum"" Kuzma 😂"
"Lol I thought you were some other dude talking to me about Kyle Kuzma and I came at you for a second😂  But still bro I think generational talent is always gonna shine through. It’s definitely true that fit and trust from your coaches is huge for success in the league, but Luka is generational. I think that kind of greatness is immune to circumstance (other than injury of course)"
The most confusing part about this for me is this: did someone actually ASK Kyle Kuzma for his opinion on something?
"Tbe best thing Kyle Kuzma has done was to literally, physically push Lebron in the back to play defense. I love Lebron, but man, that was inspiring stuff you want to see in a young guy. At the time I was like “who the fuck is Kyle Kuzma?” Haven’t really been super impressed with his fame since."
Fuck Kyle Kuzma. Luka is 50 times the player he is.

Things haven’t been right for the Lakers since the departure of the enforcer Kyle Kuzma and defensive anchor Alex Caruso
Aight we need to sign Kyle Kuzma for the ultimate light skin lineup of Curry Poole Lee JTA and Kuz
"We already know the Kings want to trade him. They've been trying since last year. Maybe another team puts out a better offer, but in the time he's been on the market (basically since before the 2021 trade deadline), the only offer the Kings were willing to accept was Montrezl's expiring contract + Kyle Kuzma.  &gt; I can’t imagine it’d be too difficult for another team to have a better package for the kings.  Yeah, the reason other teams probably haven't, is because Hield only really does one thing well. For the Lakers, that one thing is a dream, but other contending teams require more of players making that much."
Kyle Kuzma is an allstar  LaMelo is who I thought Lonzo would be for the Lakers
"People were legitimately saying Kyle Kuzma would be playing better for the lakers right now, you not stopping lakers fans from getting these shots off on every victory this season."

"I found the full quote I think you're talking about:  &gt;“When guys are making the same mistakes over and over and over, it’s hard to bite your tongue,” Rondo says, “but I tried to get \[James\] to focus on his body language … Those young guys were looking at everything he did. If they missed four shots in a row and LeBron was making a face, it was crushing to them. He was their Michael Jordan. They didn’t want to let him down. But if LeBron said one thing positive to Brandon Ingram or Kyle Kuzma, they immediately were back to their old selves.”  I would say that's talking LeBron into refining his demeanor with his younger teammates to a top level, rather than, ""Rondo was on record saying he was constantly calling out LeBron about his attitude.""  I'm also curious about the other dude's cited article about LeBron apparently doing antics that almost got him removed from Olympics consideration one year, as there was no detail about what exactly he was doing.  I presume whatever it was didn't demoralize teammates and relegated to off-court shenanigans, as even in his first Cavs stint the players were much better with him than after he left."
Bulls are finishing first seed.  Kyle Kuzma is winning most improved player of the year.
There are a few but Kyle kuzma stands out. He's not important enough to actually dislike and he hasn't done anything particularly  but at the same time he really has always annoyed me.
I hope people turn around on Kyle Kuzma and start liking him
Dude the majority of the nba fanbase was trashing Kyle Kuzma for everything stop with the its was only Laker fans take.

Kyle Kuzma GOAT arc truly in full force
"What is ""the best value"" for Simmons?  That's really the crux of the issue here, which everybody in the ""Trade him!"" camp seems to be ignoring.   If you're not getting a player who substantially improves your rotation, why make a deal? Who cares about, say, Washington's 2023 pick and Kyle Kuzma? Do you think there's realistically a better offer on the table than that?  Morey was never going to get a top 10 player for Simmons, but if he's not getting a borderline all-star (let's say, top 40 player) ... why should he bother?   Just for fun, let's use ESPN'S RPM (just for convenience, it's a pretty flawed measure) and count the players who you think have a current team would trade him for Simmons and would meaningfully improve the Sixers. Devontae Graham would help, but the Pels aren't making that trade. Terry Rozier would help, but Charlotte isn't making that trade. Fox appears to be off the table. How far down the list do you get before you find a trade that it actually seems like could get made?"
Only mortals believe they can defeat Kyle Kuzma
"He might have some potential, but until he runs an offense himself, you can't really make that claim.  So let's use a couple of metrics to look at this, because shot creation involves getting your own shot as well as setting up your teammates. And we'll use Booker as the comparison, since he's arguably the worse of the 3 listed in the comparison:  Drives (Booker above average, Herro below average):  1. Booker: 54.9% on 5.6 attempts 2. Herro: 47.6% on 3.5 attempts  Pull up Jumpers (Booker above average, Herro around average):  1. Booker: 44.2% on 9.2 attempts 2. Herro: 37.9% on 5.9 attempts  Assist to pass percentage (Trae is second in the NBA at 21.1, Booker is top 10, Herro is on like the 3rd page)  1. Booker: 19.2% 2. Herro: 11.9%  As you can see with these 3 stats, which all measure creating offense, Herro isn't a very good shot creator. He doesn't finish well at the rim, his pull up jumper isn't great, and his percentage of passes that are meaningful to his team and not just a bailout is pretty low.  I understand that you have tunnel vision as a heat fan, but Booker, Trae, and especially Luka are all leagues above Herro. A better comparison to Herro would be someone like Kyle Kuzma. Borderline starter, good 6th man."

Kyle Kuzma effect
Oh god he’s gonna be Kyle Kuzma 2.0 is he?
"I think being on the Clippers, with their emotional leadership vacuum, let a lot of role players feel bigger than they would elsewhere, especially on Lakers. Nothing wrong with feeling good about themselves but that plus the LA halo can distort things. See also: Kyle Kuzma."
Kyle Kuzma is almost 30 years old in his 4th NBA season. /s
"Fuck Kyle Kuzma as a staff, record label and as a motherfucken crew"
Kyle Kuzma out here like Kazuma Kiryu.
I have a friend who asked me once if I know Kyle Kuzma the basketball player cause my friend I guess has his shoes autographed and was hyping to my friend up about how kuzma is gonna become big and when he does he's gonna sell those shoes for a lot.....and my friend was asking like is he a big name? Lmao
A big selling point: being able to bully Kyle Kuzma
"Simmons trade idea of the day:   Sixers receive:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  Wizards receive:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors receive:   * Davis Bertans  * Seth Curry  * Kyle Kuzma  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Sixers 2023, 2027 1sts   * Sixers pick swaps every other year available  * Wizards 2025, 2027 1sts   We know that the Raptors were interested in moving on from Siakam last year (he was heavily linked to the Warriors). We know that the Wizards could use Ben Simmons. We know the Sixers are win-now and want star power.   Sixers immediately say yes to turning Simmons, Curry, Thybulle, Maxey, and picks into Siakam and VanVleet. That's two borderline all-star level players that take them, in my opinion, to the top of the Eastern Conference. VanVleet/Green/Siakam/Harris/Embiid is ridiculous. Fred and Pascal can both shoot well enough, Pascal is of course a do it all wing, Fred can run point, and both play good defense.   Wizards move a negative asset (Bertans), some second-rate youth, and some picks for Ben Simmons. A Beal/Simmons pairing works really well. Simmons can run point and play defense, Beal can play off ball and take all the shots.   Raptors move a guy they've been interested in moving (Siakam) plus a guard in his absolute prime who has limitations to his game and who doesn't quite fit their timeline (Fred). In return, they get a wealth of picks and young players, plus a PG and two forwards who can contribute immediately (Seth, Bertans, Kuzma). They can probably flip one or more of those guys for more assets or a player who fits better. Meanwhile, Matisse is a total Masai player, and Maxey is a decently promising young guard -- something the Raptors lack.    Who says no?"
It’s gotta be bad when Kyle Kuzma is laughing at u
I think he’s just referencing how everyone called our young players trash when they were on the Lakers but then suddenly love them once they’re not on the Lakers. Examples:  -	Julius Randle -	Jordan Clarkson -	D’Angelo Russel -	Larry Nance -	Brandon Ingram -	Lonzo Ball -	Alex Caruso -	Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma Phoenix Suns Playoffs  6 games  6 ppg  3 rpg  23% FG  10% 3PFG  Maybe don't talk shit about how you did with the Lakers bud
Kyle Kuzma to the Shanghai Sharks confirmed?
"That's what he told Kyle Kuzma, Dion Waiters, and Delonte West right before they boarded their last flights as his teammates."
"I miss absolutely no parts of Kyle Kuzma, but KCP I will probably miss the most of all former Lakers. KCP isn’t a big or lengthy guard but he was one of the best defensive guards and was great at navigating screens."
Imagine if Kyle Kuzma balls out this season lol

Shit of Kyle kuzma all you want. But atleast Kyle was a iron man.
The Nuggets miss the playoffs  Chris Finch wins Coach of the Year  Celtics make it to the Finals  Kyle Kuzma makes the All-Star team  Paul George wins MVP
Kyle Kuzma is/was better than THT at any point during his career.
"How are they better? They lost a lot of playmaking, their rim protection is awful, and I’m sorry but Kyle kuzma and Kcp aren’t saving their defense."
"tht, the new kyle kuzma."
"In the past 2 years, Wizards had 7 former Laker Players:  Isaac Bonga  Moritz Wagner  Thomas Bryant  Kyle Kuzma   Montrezl Harrell   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Joel Ayayi  If you jump back one more year, you can add Isaiah Thomas to the list too."
"Really?   Players from these seasons drafted 15-30 who look like they will be starters this season:   2017 - John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunony, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White   2018 - Donte DiVincenzo, Lonnie Walker, Robert Williams   2019 - NAW, Jordan Poole, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr   2020 - Saddiq Bey, Precious Achiuwa, Jaden McDaniels   Philly isn't drafting these guys. They're not one of the best drafting teams. They're middle of the pack. Drafting Thybulle and Maxey amongst these picks isn't outstanding."
 Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma MVP
• The Denver Nuggets will miss the playoffs  • Chris Finch will win Coach of the Year  • Kyle Kuzma will be an All-Star
You’re literally using a defensive metric that says Kyle Kuzma and Seth Curry are better defensive players than Kawhi Leonard. If that doesn’t tell you defensive metrics aren’t shit I don’t know what to tell you. I’m 90% sure you’re trolling here though.

Lmfaooooooo ur comparing an all time great to Kyle Kuzma coming off the bench?
"I personally think, that he could absolutely reach the same heights as fellow superstar Kyle Kuzma."
I just can’t get over the talent gap between the era’s. Kyle Kuzma would be an all-star in the 60’s.
"Cam Reddish, Malik Monk, Justice Winslow, Kris Dunn, Mo Bamba, Lonnie Walker, Dante Exum, Dennis Smith Jr., and Kyle Kuzma. I think Kuzma is going to be at least mentioned in all-star considerations being Washginton's second option.  There's the obvious choices that everyone won't shut up about like OG, Poole, and Herro, and their fanbases are being so obnoxious about then that I kinda want them to fail. Less Herro than the other two since he already had his hype a year ago."
"DC is in a soft rebuild with lots of valuable role players to potentially trade for another top player at the deadline. Wes Unseld Jr has lots of floor combos to experiment with before the front office decides who to keep and who to shop around. But if there’s anyone the fans will turn to if things go sour, it’s easily Kyle Kuzma. His preseason has been spotty and he’s just naturally easy to hate on when the going gets tough. KCP and especially Harrell have both been better received in their Wiz debuts."

"What if Wilt never existed and you’re just in a Truman Show where we’re all just paid to pretend like he did  Also CP3 isn’t Kyle Kuzma, but if you were trying to compare Wilt to say, Shaq, I would also call you out on not knowing enough to make a judgment call on that"
I didn't watch Wilt but I can confidently say Wilt is better than Kyle Kuzma

"Lakers went from consensus championship favorites when healthy with Kuz, to looking like fringe play-in teams. The Wizards add kuz and now they look like a top eastern conference team. Now pretend I cherry pick a few stars about his +/- or per-36 or something. BOOM, league’s best player Kyle Kuzma."
Jesus Christ warriors fans are butthurt. Are you the same dude that said that Kyle Kuzma has an argument for being goat? or was that a different warriors fan?
"Until now, I would probably have agreed with you. The thing is that Kanter changing his name makes everything else he is doing and saying seem weird. If Kyle Kuzma had changed his name to Kyle Kuzma Freedom, the reaction would be ""Eh, whatever"". But because Enes Kanter have decided to use his platform to critique the people holding power, rightly in most cases, his critique will now be coming from someone who changed his name to ""Freedom"". And that discredits everything else he's saying, because can we really trust what a guy who changed his name to ""Freedom""?"
Could you imagine if someone had a team of players like:  Lonzo Ball  D'Angelo Russell  Brandon Ingram  Julius Randle  Kyle Kuzma  ?
Kyle kuzma once again proves why he’s the most clutch player in the league

Kyle Kuzma was going to thrive in a new environment.
"He was shit on but it's nothing compared to what he would have been if you compared it to now with social media, people didn't care as much then as they do now and the exposure of social media is way bigger  Even MJ himself has said that he wouldn't have survived the social media era, i don't think people realize how insanely hard it is if you just search up your name you will literally see thousands of hate comments even if you're a Kyle Kuzma now imagine LeBron  You actually don't even need to search up, people will comment on your social media and even send you dms"
Or just be a decent role player. If he had been drafted by the Wizards no one would know who Kyle Kuzma is.
"I get what’s your saying totally, but Kyle with AD would be absolutely terrifying. Add in his ability to run an offense, the fact he doesn’t turn over the ball often and his defense and he’d definitely be the better player  You’d also still have Kuzma on the roster and Harrell (he was in the Westbrook trade right?). Your roster would be far better in my opinion. Could even package those guys for another player if you’d rather"
"Just pathetic. And to think the Lakers once had Brandon Ingram, Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart - all of whom are decent to good players. All traded away."
Kyle Kuzma is the embodiment of this
Kelly Oubre is what this sub thinks Kyle Kuzma is.
Second only to Kyle kuzma and Bradley Beal.
Kuzma is a walking L? As in NBA champion Kyle kuzma?
"I showed this to my girlfriend and she said ""who is that?"" I said that's Kyle kuzma, he used to play for the Lakers and then he got traded.  She said, ""Kuzma, that's like kuzco and yzma put together."""

That’s the Kyle Kuzma no look
"I cant comment on his fashion game but ill just say I've never seen a good Kyle Kuzma game and at this point I wonder if they even exist.  Dude's shots make Westbrook look good.  His game's nothing but off the side of the rim threes, spin around airballs and step back backboard heaves.  I've never seen a dude that misses so many shots so poorly.   Maybe I've just seen all the wrong games but jeez"

Kyle Kuzma gets to bring a Kardashian to the bed tonight for those FTs.
"The greatest difference between Kyle Kuzma this year and Kyle Kuzma last season is definitely his fourth quarter execution. Last year he shrank as the minutes dwindles and this year, even when he plays a bad game in the first three quarters, he steps up in the fourth"
"Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso."
Do you think the Lakers could package their underperforming role players for a legit third star?  Maybe like Kyle Kuzma?
"That was a **great** move.  We traded Wall who hadn’t played in 2 seasons for Russ.  Russ got his stock at a premium again by getting us to the Playoffs and going on a tear.  **We then traded Russ for and get this, there’s a list :)**  **Spencer Dinwiddie (huge ACL comeback season)**  **Montrezl Harrell (current 6MOTY candidate)**  **Kyle Kuzma (improved in pts, reb, assist, steals, blks)**  **KCP (still playing elite defense)**  **Pick 22 in 2021 Draft… that was then on traded for Aaron Holiday and Pick 31 which was Isaiah Todd**  So in total the Wiz built a totally new squad and the Lakers took on Russ and his ridiculously terrible contract…**did I mention that he has a Player Option for next year LOL**  If we win 50 games, Tommy Sheppard is Executive of the Year."
"&gt;Spencer Dinwiddie, Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, KCP and a 1st Round Pick  &gt;I think it was worth it for us  No need to be humble, you guys fleeced everyone!"
"We turned broken John Wall who hadn’t played in nearly 2 years into Russ who got us to the playoffs and upped his value.  Then used that to get Spencer Dinwiddie, Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, KCP and a 1st Round Pick (traded that for Aaron Holiday and slightly later pick Isaiah Todd)  I think it was worth it for us cause he got us to where we are now lol"
We did something similar to Kyle Kuzma last week. People are wildn’ now a days
"I don't understand how Walton thought these adjustments would save his job.  You had four dynamic guards in which you could have three of them in at any time. You had switchability on the perimeter and passable spacing even if all Harkless did was flit around the perimeter and miss too many open 3s. Hence Barnes could shoot 8 threes a game and thrive doing it and get downhill whenever he wanted. You even had a big body in Len that could help stem you physicality/rebounding problem.  Was it even particularly good? No, and the 4 game slide proves that. They're missing another forward. They choke too much. But if you kept at that, I could've easily seen him keeping his job. Their net rating was the best since '06.  Then he completely flips the switch and goes with full-sized lineups again. At ALL times. He doesn't even just start with a full-sized lineup, if Metu isn't in, Bagley is. He forces Barnes back to be a full-time goddamned 3, kills the spacing, clogs the paint, and kills the switchability on defense.  This is the guy who has played Kyle Kuzma and Harrison Barnes at C. He goes to this NOW?!  And all of this for the saviors of Chimezie Metu and Marvin Bagley. For their rebounding problem. When neither of them are good defensive rebounders.  Bottom line is they were a flawed team that was using its best attributes to its advantage.  May make some statement wins, may lose pretty badly. But ever since the OKC game, they've looked like a bottom 3 team.  He has to be smoking rock."

"Alex Caruso,juan Tuscano Anderson,Patty Mills,Kyle Kuzma,Harrison Barnes"
Melo's hit some 3's.  Only has a foul but he's lucky he doesn't have two. Kyle Kuzma thinks he's much better than he is. Nick Richards met his dad Daniel Gafford. Good first quarter but you haven't missed much.
And if they both win then that means Kyle Kuzma is number 1
"Kyle Kuzma, it’d be legendary.  If we’re talking recently retired players tho gimme J.R Smith. He’ll use his J.R squint stare to analyze and DEMOLISH every opposing team’s strategies.  He’d probably also lose his train of thought from time to time and jump in the game himself."
"Most reasonable Lakers fans saw his value from the start. It was just casuals who thought he was like his dad when he was the complete opposite. At minimum he was a really great defender and great playmaker in transition for us. He kept improving his jumper too which shows the dude was putting in the work. I'll always have love for the guy and like all our young guys (besides Kuzma), I was really sad to see him go. And it's not even that I don't like Kyle, the expectations were just different at that point and he was incredibly frustrating last year and it seemed his time here had run its course. Will always look fondly on his contributions for us too especially since he was part of the championship team."
Dwight never carried a team to a ring where the third best guy was named Kyle Kuzma

Even if he wasn’t the Lakers’ first choice, it was easy to envision a scenario where he would be their best available option. &gt; &gt;For the Lakers, according to those with knowledge of the situation, it was imperative to keep as many potential avenues open as possible. &gt; &gt;Sources said Pelinka and his front-office group strongly considered executing a sign-and-trade for the 32-year-old DeRozan, giving up Kuzma and Caldwell-Pope in the process, but couldn’t come to consensus terms with the Spurs in free agency or a suitable contract number for DeRozan. What’s more, sources say the DeRozan option never advanced to the point that it was presented to Buss.  so they'd have to offer more than that...."
"After watching Lonzo, Brandon, Josh and Alex today and in previous games this season here is my ranking of the 2017-2019 Lakers ""core""  Brandon Ingram  Kyle Kuzma = Lonzo Ball  Alex Caruso = Josh Hart"
"The Wizards are 10-3, first in the East and Kyle Kuzma leads the team in minutes played.   It's honestly hilarious how much hate Kuz generates just by existing. Jealous, petty people I guess."
"There is no league in the world (other than the nba) with a player better than Kyle Kuzma. And kuzma is at least top 150 in the nba.   You’ve buried a ridiculous statement amongst a bunch of true statements, so I agree with the sentiment, overall."
the city of cleveland is trying to beef with kyle kuzma for clout lol
"My eyes read Kyle Kuzma, my brain reads Kiryu Kazuma."
I’ve watched more Kyle kuzma games(laker tenure) than you’ve probably watched NBA games. I spent $200 on league pass I’m pretty sure I watch way more games than you. I watched 6 minutes of the wizards to game to see this defense you speak of and Ingrams first game back from injury he drops 9 points on Kuzma EXCLUSIVELY. I didn’t need to watch another minute to see how much knowledge of the game you actually have.
"""OK, Sac, 45-minute flight. That’s not bad. I can go to Napa"" - Kyle Kuzma"

Kyle Kuzma is not taking any of your crap.   You go Kyle.
He asked a question and I'm giving him an honest answer. I hate Kyle Kuzma because i think he looks dumb

I am Kyle Kuzma.

For some reason it never registered with me that Kyle Kuzma is 6'10.
"Kyle ""Shoot until you get hot, then shoot some more"" Kuzma!"
Pain is being a Kyle Kuzma 3 away from the #1 seed :/
The only thing separating us and 1st place was f'n Kyle Kuzma.
"Well they turned Westbrook, Troy Brown Jr, Moe Wagner, and Chandler Hutchison into Spencer Dinwiddie, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell, Aaron Holiday, Isaiah Todd, Daniel Gafford."
Kyle NBA Champion Kuzma strikes again
"Also, we don't have the popularity that the Lakers or Warriors have by sheer numbers. Kyle Kuzma became a relatively well-known name just for being on the Lakers. If Bam or Herro were on the Lakers, they'd be some of the most popular All-Stars currently."
You realize that LeBron is the cause of this “dumpster fire” right? He and AD balked on the Hield for Kuzma trade to target Westbrook because they wanted that third star on their team - despite Westbrook being well…himself.  No doubt LeBron and Klutch are also  heavily influencing management on how valuable THT really is when in reality not packaging him for Kyle Lowry and forcing ownership to penny pinch on Alex Caruso are clearly huge mistakes.  If this season implodes it’s squarely on LeBron who pulled the strings on most of the trades and FA acquisitions.
"Oh no, it was kyle kuzma all along ..."
Kyle Kuzma
&gt;to quote Kyle Kuzma: Lakers wouldn't be shit without LeBron  This speaks to lakers over the last 10 years more than the cavs. We have had two rebuilds more successful than yours. Your franchise is run by clowns but happens to have a great brand. Congrats ya entitled jackass.
to quote Kyle Kuzma: Cleveland wouldn't be shit without LeBron
You know who else is an NBA champion? Kyle Kuzma.
The Washington Wizards are off to a fantastic start. Their chemistry has proven that they are a  hungry team ready for playoff contentions. Players Monteral Harris and Kyle Kuzma have proven from the trade that they are prepared and able to perform their talents. Bradley Beal still leading the team with his 23 points 5.5 rebounds and 5.6 assists per game also shows their ethic. They are leading in the eastern conference. Do you think they are ready to give Washington a championship?

You’re talking about informed NBA fans tho. I’m talking about casual fans. Nobody is hyping up Malcolm Brogdon lol.  Ask a casual fan who’s better between Kyle kuzma and brogdon and 95% of ppl will say kuzma. This is just one example and is kinda OPs point
"Fair is fair, but is a little nauseating when you getting downvoted for  maybe suggesting that Kyle Kuzma isn’t a star of the future, or that Caruso is a good backup point guard, but nothing more."
Bojan Bogdanovic  OG Anunoby   DeMar DeRozan  Kyle Kuzma   Mikal Bridges   Caris LeVert  Joe Harris
He gets a bad rep because he's Doc's son and there are still some people that think he's only in the league because of his dad. He's a very legit player and still don't really understand why he was basically playing the the min the last couple of years and now playing on this cheap deal again when Kyle Kuzma got close to 50 mill.
"Kyle ""LeBron James"" Kuzma"
"Hell, Kyle Kuzma is the most tenured Laker."
Kyle Kuzma in shambles
What's the difference between Pascal Siakam and Kyle Kuzma?  a little less than 130 million dollars
See; Kyle Kuzma
Take it back one year and you add Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball.   How you feel about it now bro
"Trez on the Clippers was one of their 5 best players and part of their closing lineup. They relied on him for their success, so if he played poorly or had trouble defending it made the Clippers vulnerable. On the Lakers he's behind LeBron and AD, so he just comes in as a bench role and isn't going to be relied on to finish important games. The Lakers don't even need him to play at all to be successful as they could play Markieff Morris or Kyle Kuzma or Marc Gasol in those frontcourt minutes and still win. Same player but different roles. See how that works?"
In sure you'd rather have Lakers star Kyle Kuzma.
Lebron has a game tying shot blocked vs the spurs and needed Kyle Kuzma to save him. What is this revisionism?
and just a couple years ago I remember the same thing happening with some other guy. Kyle Kuzma or something like that
"Kuzma.  I think he could be Kyle ""Killer"" Kuzma or just Triple-K for short"
"Those already started this offseason. I also saw one of those bullshit trade articles on ‘nbadraftanalysis.net’ (thank you Google app) titled “This Hawks-Lakers trade includes an intriguing young wing:  Hawks receive: Kyle Kuzma, Talen Horton Tucker   Lakers receive: Cam Reddish and a 2nd round pick”  Like, fuck no, the hawks aren’t trading their highest upside young wing for kuzma amd THT."
There is a guy named u/TanBoots whose job is only to shit on kyle kuzma. Hes blocked me. I dont get why these people even exist. It's so sad.
"&gt; They were considered busts until they went to other teams  Not by competent GMs they weren't. The Nets wouldn't have been willing to trade Brook Lopez and Kyle Kuzma for Timofey Mozgov's horrid contract if they thought they were getting a bust in D'lo as the sweetner. The Pels wouldn't have traded Anthony Davis if the centerpiece of the trade was a guy they thought was a bust.   The only reason these guys were considered ""busts"" is because Laker haters like yourself wanted to call them that, no matter how promising they looked or how well they were playing. Guys like you were saying shit like ""he's a bust"" from day one, and you never moved off that until they weren't on the Lakers anymore and then immediately your narrative changed to ""the Lakers fucked up by trading such a promising young player!"""
"Yeah but they've also hit on a few lower picks and got solid players at the bottom. Zubac, Thomas Bryant, Alex Caruso, Josh hart and Kyle kuzma are all guys they've found who have become solid players in the NBA. And that's just from the past few years. Admittedly Josh hart and Thomas Bryant were draft day trades but still. Credit where credit is due, Lakers scouting department is elite."
"I want a championship. I have no problem with being the Mario Chalmers, Tyson Chandler, or Kyle Kuzma for a championship team. My ego will be just fine."
"Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving would easily shoot at least 50/50/90 in the NBA Finals against the Lakers, especially with Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell and Talen Horton-Tucker on the team.  As a Kevin Durant fan.... I would much rather face the Lakers than the Clippers in the Finals.  Nets in 4 against the Lakers."
"What's the difference between Pascal Siakam and Kyle Kuzma?  about 32 million dollars a year  Can't believe Raptors fans were adamant up until the playoffs last year that this dude was even on Jaylen Brown's level, let alone Tatum's"

I too didn’t notice the extreme zoom in at the beginning of video showing Kyle Kuzma in a Black Jersey that say Lakers on it.
Don’t doubt that LeBron has been great on defence this season but defensive stats are basically garbage especially defensive rating  I mean Nerlens Noel is currently 3rd and Montezl Harrell (a notoriously bad defender) is top 10 and people like Jakob Poetl and Kyle Kuzma are above Ben Simmons

"Rings turn a bitter feeling into a sweet one. Like of Kuzma and Lonzo were friends and Kuzma was upset about the AD trade, that'd be gone after they won a ring.  Friendships are nice and all but every NBA players ultimate goal is that ring, and I'm certain Kyle understands that ring 100% doesn't happen without Deebo getting shipped off.

"players ""improve"" when they get more shots and a chance to handle the ball enough to get better. when you're on lebron's team, you have a great chance to win a title, but you aren't given much leash in the sense that if you don't play well, you won't get minutes. lebron's teams don't have the time or priority to develop young guys. kyle kuzma is an okay player, but i think he would definitely see the ""stats boost"" that those other young guys saw if he went to a shitty team like DLO, Lonzo, Randle, or Ingram. this is why people will be shocked to see blake griffin average 7 ppg and 3 rpg on the nets"
There were those from this sub who also believed Kyle Kuzma was better than Tatum so take that for what it’s worth

Because Claxton is a project that might require years to develop and the Nets want to win now?  Because Kuzma has probably reached his potential as a player and Lakers also want to continue winning?  If we could flip young Kyle Anderson and Cory Joseph back in 2014-15 say for 34 years old Pau Gasol, I'd be fucking ecstatic."
Tyler Herro and Kyle Kuzma. Casuals either overrate or underrate them a ton
Will there ever be a time that Lakers fans can finally come together and agree that Kyle Kuzma is useless and we should get rid of him the first chance we get?? I sure hope so
There's not a player in the western conference less likable than Kyle fucking Kuzma. If there's a player who talks more banal shit than him I seriously do not know who it is.
Kyle Kuzma needs to shut the fuck up.
5 x 5 watch: Kyle Kuzma is 3 Reb 5 ast 5 stl and 4 blks away from the 5 x 5 club
Kyle Kuzma-esque.
HARP leader list goes like   1. Grayson Allen  2. PatBev  3. Kyle Kuzma
Celtics will win the championship this year   Tyler Herro is a poor mans kyle Kuzma and Jimmy Butler doesn’t have a great work ethic he just has a bad sleep schedule.  Order restored  Also Bam... fuck it I can’t even make something up about Bam. He’s dope.
"This was a reckoning for Kyle Kuzma. He has taken petty sneak disses at Luka over the years, and he had an opportunity to back it up without the protection of AD and LeBron. The result: 6 points in 31 minutes. He should learn to stay in his lane."
Kyle Kuzma is the only man that doesn’t know Kyle Kuzma is gay.
The league really gave Kyle Kuzma and Andre Drummond a prime Anthony Davis.
Is Kyle Kuzma “Lead VanVleet” then?
"No it wasn't. The spurs [asked for](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2018/7/3/17533090/lakers-trade-rumors-spurs-brandon-ingram-josh-hart-kyle-kuzma-kawhi-leonard) Ingram, Kuzma, Hart, 2 picks, and 2 pick swaps and everyone including Magic acted like the ask was ridiculous.   [This](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23935910/san-antonio-spurs-engaged-los-angeles-lakers-boston-celtics-kawhi-leonard-trade-talks) is the only trade offer from the lakers that included Ingram - Ingram and one pick and presumably having to take on a negative contract in Dieng."
If you are Kyle Kuzma or Tyler Herro - you should be humble. If you are Joel Embiid or Kevin Durant or anybody of this caliber - you shouldn't.
Suns end up getting the one seed but lose to the warriors first round. Clips make their first conference finals only for rondo and kawhi to let them Down while PG goes off and does his best so they lose in 6 to the Lakers. Nets come in injured to the playoffs and lose to the heat in the first round in 7. Sixers end up losing to the 5 seed knicks in 7 as embiid is batting injuries and Simmons can’t carry. Bucks sweep the knicks in the conference finals. Bucks vs Lakers comes down to a game 6 final shot Lakers down by 1 and instead of passing lebron goes up for the layup through 3 guys gets fouled and makes 1/2 free throws. Bucks have 5 seconds left but turnover on the inbounds pass as Middleton slips and lebron goes down to the other end of the floor and passes to kyle kuzma who for some reason was on and his shot kawhis on the rim only to eventually fall in. Kyle kuzma gets named finals mvp after average 20 10 and 3
Yes. And that man's name is Kyle Kuzma
"Why is the PBA a mediocre hellhole?  Imagine Steve Ballmer owns the Clippers, Knicks, and Bulls.  Imagine Joe Tsai owns the Nets, Lakers, and Sixers.  Imagine that aside from Lacob's Warriors and Cuban's Mavericks all other teams exist to trade their best players to the aforementioned six teams the way you trade Zion Williamson for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Kyle Kuzma, and Alex Caruso.  Imagine the salary cap implications of the aforementioned trade are irrelevant because the first six teams mentioned can pay their players way more than the what's on their official contract.  That's the PBA for you."
"Ask yourself these questions.  1. Is he better than Tim Duncan? No  2. Is he better than Karl Malone? No.  3. Is he better than Kevin garnett? No.   4. Is he better than Charles? No.  5. Is he better than Kyle kuzma? No.  Sorry, he ain't in the top 5"
"[He doesn’t know what he’s talking about](https://money.yahoo.com/kyle-kuzma-gets-dragged-coronavirus-214432961.html). Just comes across as privileged as hell whenever he talks about it amongst other things   “ ""Yeah try putting a bubble over Los Angeles see how that works kid lol,"" he tweeted. ""Our ancestors that lived during plagues, Spanish flus, chicken pox etc. didn't live in the new world we live in lol nice try. ... Places in the country were shut down.

Kyle Kuzma is a joke compared to Luka. Disrespectful
You’re talking about U of U legend Kyle Kuzma
"Kyle ""Lance Bass"" Kuzma"
Kyle Kuzma is himself an insta thot who happens to play basketball. It’s obvious what his main concerns are.
Bruh I get TROUNCED on this sub for saying this hahaha. I always call him Kyle Kuzma of the Heat.
"she first got noticed when she was on americas next top model but she hustled to get beyond that. she’s been on the covers of vogue (like ten times), bazaar, elle, glamour, marie claire, she’s appeared at the met gala *alone*, and the list goes on. she’s a whole human person who worked hard to get where she is. she’s way more famous than fucking kyle kuzma lmao.  i just find it funny that all these random dudes on reddit call successful and independent women thots when they’ve probably never even been with a woman full stop."
Y’all care WAY too much about Kyle Kuzma
yo why have I never realized this?🤣🤣 Kyle Kuzma has a ring haha that’s amazing
Don’t disrespect NBA champion IG thot slayer Kyle Kuzma
"Also drafted Kuzma, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo, Julius Randle, Kyle Kuzma in that time. I think Lakers fans just confuse normal rebuilding struggles with questionable moves because they arent used to losing for that long"
Kyle Kuzma.  Just looks like a dbag and I follow Vanessa hudgens on Instagram and he saw that went on a date with her one time and he doesn’t deserve that goddess.
Kyle Kuzma
I really just hate Kyle Kuzma for no reason in particular. His slim shady look isn’t helping.
Kyle Kuzma.
"Kyle Kuzma on the Block: ""not going for the dunk was never an option for me. If I had 100 opportunities to dunk and I could dunk just one of those 100, I will continue to try to dunk them."""
Kyle Kuzma has 5M followers on IG while Evan Fournier has 236K
"Wait so you're telling me people won't be excited to watch Kyle Kuzma, THT, and Schroder?"
The very thought of Kyle Kuzma evokes a visceral reaction from all these fucking losers
Be honest... Are you Kyle Kuzma?
"No, he has to marry Khloe first and become Kyle Kuzma-Kardashian. That new nickname will make him the best-selling jersey south of the Mason-Dixon line."
Kyle Kuzma could not *be* more touchable
Kyle Kuzma our plus minus leader again.
Kyle Kuzma!
because Kyle Kuzma knows all about the coaching that Drummond has had...
[Kyle Kuzma](https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/persons/652212/652212_v9_bb.jpg)
Especially coming from Kyle fuggin’ Kuzma
"Literally every single time our team owner is mentioned, the incels come out to play, ready to respond with ""hope she sees this"" when called out  Like goddamn nobody cares about your sexual fantasy about Kyle Kuzma put that shit away"
I just kind of hate when Kyle Kuzma person talks
"They take it as a like a personal attack or something. You can tell by all the ""You don't watch the games. If you did you would be able to make baseless claimes like me!"" comments that you struck a nerve. Or the ""Can't wait to play y'all in the playoffs"". Like the Lakers are gonna win playoff series cuz they got Kyle Kuzma."
Kyle Kuzma is not the sharpest tool in the shed
Kyle Kuzma kinda never got taught grammar in his school

Kyle Kuzma is playing like his girl broke up with him 5 minutes before the game and she told him I like Robin Lopez now.
I love Kyle Kuzma.
I strongly dislike Kyle Kuzma.
Kyle Kuzma is the most invisible player this playoffs immo.

Kyle Kuzma
Now it is weird when I see a player like Kyle Kuzma play a game in ankle socks and nothing else on his legs. Looks almost naked.
"""Eastern Conference Kuzma"" is now disrespectful to Kyle Kuzma"
Kyle Kuzma looking tan
Tyler Herro really is just a shittier Kyle Kuzma who is white

Another great performance from the great Kyle Kuzma ...
"Lol, in NBA 2K20 there's a line about that from Kevin Harlan:  ""Young Kyle Kuzma is not a ball stopper, when he gets the ball, he is shooting it!""  *both announcers laugh*"
Kyle Kuzma so happy everyone else on the team sucked as well.
"Kyle Kuzma : ""No way we're winning a game, let alone a series, with me playing the way he played. This one is on AD"""

"Kyle Kuzma on Lebron James: “His attention to detail. He’s just smart. Knows what we want him to do. Always in the right place at the right tine. He just makes plays. Some in the box score, some don’t. (Tonight they did).”"
"Credit to the great mentor The King!!  Honorable members:  Kyle Kuzma,  Dennis Schröder,  and welcome on board Wesley Matthews!!! XD"
"If knicks are proof of anything it is that no quagmire is eternal. But I agree Lebron made us what we are. But I watched the baby lakers and seeing what they have all developed into you can't say they wouldnt at least be a competitive playoff team this year even without lebron. We would have Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle Lonzo Ball Kyle Kuzma as well as out other pieces currently on the roster. Maybe Randle needed to leave to become what he is but even if he was close to it on the lakers that is a tough team that I think could be a finals threat in the coming years."
think you got it wrong. kyle kuzma is the name.
"You don't represent the entire fanbase. EVERYONE wanted Danny Green off the team. His 3 pt shooting was Kyle Kuzma level bad in the finals. His IQ on defense is elite, but everyone wanted to off-load a $15 million/year player who was only playing defense. You're not seeing my point that we still needed Schroder this regular season to deal with the Lebron/AD injuries. You can't debate that."

Holy fuck I love Kyle Kuzma
Are the warriors really gunna get beat by Kyle Kuzma?
As much as I hate to say this but we need more of Kyle Kuzma and less of Drummond. Don't fucking sub Drummond in for the rest of the game.

Not if Kyle Kuzma and the Lakers have anything to say about it.
"Sure, but he did get heavy minutes from known defensive stalwarts Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schroder, and Andre Drummond, so is it really that impressive?"
You’re about 2 days late with this post. But Kyle Kuzma already told the media how things were and put it the best way possible.
"Allen's ceiling seems to be Clint Capela and he's not there quite yet so his statement is harsh but accurate. However, in terms of predicting which players will be stars in the future I can think of a handful of other fanbases who are worse. For starters, I'd like to know your original thoughts about Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Brandon Ingram and your current thoughts on Talen Horton-Tucker."
Your team didn’t even make the playoffs 2 seasons ago. With Lebron James Kyle Kuzma Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball on the roster.
"Naw, these are the quotes they truncate into, Kyle Kuzma said that teams are ... ~~don't look at it as~~ ducking"
Kyle Kuzma haters currently having  brain aneurysm’s due to the fact that they can’t shit on him for this quote
Kyle Kuzma has had more quotes posted from him than almost all the role players in the league better than him combined
Teams don't want Kyle Kuzma as much as the Lakers (or Laker fans) think teams want Kyle Kuzma
"Their stats are pretty close, Kuz just has more ppg and way more rpg. Also has more mpg though.   That being said… you’re only validating my point by comparing one of the warriors most important players to Kyle Kuzma lol Kuz is like our 6th or 7th most important guy"
Kyle Kuzma
I mean they can't really get much other than Kyle Kuzma.
"Right? It boggles my mind that people always fall for these obvious PR statements.   Like the Lakers would come out and say   ""yeah unfortunately we couldn't get rid of that Kuzma guy lmao""   When they could say   ""We would never trade our star child Kyle, he is an important part of our future""  And then there will be an expectation for Kyle Kuzma to repay the Lakers for the loyalty they actually never even had for him. And the fans eat it up hahaha"

"Vogel has to be pissed. He was clearly hoping the team out there could put the game away without Bron and AD. They threw away a 14 point lead with ease. Btw, Kyle Kuzma is the only player in the NBA who double dribbles, travels on a regular basis. It's unreal."
I miss kyle kuzma
Did the Bucks pick up Kyle Kuzma off the waivers?
I didn't know Kyle Kuzma played for the Bucks!
"Great value Kyle ""slim shady"" Kuzma"
"&gt; Holmes is not a defensive guy lol  At least he can grab a rebound once in a while. The defensive possession doesn't end until your team gets the ball back, so rebounding is an important part of team defense. And Porzingis had a worse Reb% in the 1st round than Kyle Kuzma. He gave up multiple offensive rebounds to smaller Clippers who had no business getting em."
Kyle kuzma and drummond for thj who says no?
Porzingis is 7’3 Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma needs the practice haha
"LeCCP is collectivizing the NBA under LA. When asked what would happen to Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schroeder, and Andre Drummond, LeMao replied “Ever heard of Siberia?”"
Kyle Kuzma.  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills over here.

So is that trade considered Kyle Kuzma for a taller Kyle Kuzma? Or is it Kristaps Porzingis for a smaller Hingus Pingus?
&gt;      Andre Drummond      Montrezl Harrell      Kyle Kuzma      Julius Randle      Mitchell Robinson      Duncan Robinson  We got a fucking squad now boys

This sub is so boring. 12 different variations of the same Doncic post. Tingus Pingus or Kyle Kuzma or That’s tuff 🔥 can be found in every thread. 36 different LeBron James posts despite the Lakers being eliminated for days now.   Just so boring.

Kyle Kuzma
trey burke doing his best kyle kuzma impression out there running around at full speed just to give up possession
Porzingis is basically 7'3 Kyle Kuzma
"Could I interest you one nba champion Kyle kuzma? /s    But nah depending on if the clippers blow it up or the sixers need to make moves, I could see either Harris, or a package for Paul George being on the table. I’m sure lakers/sixers and some fringe contenders would be very interested in cj if the asking price isn’t outrageous"
Kyle Kuzma won a ring. Got paid… and is half way through the IG Thot yellow pages.  Dude is just cruising.
Kyle Kuzma.
And don't forget the best player in the draft Kyle Kuzma lmao
Sounds more like Kyle kuzma
"Nonsense. Y’all can have Schroeder, Drummond, and we’ll even sweeten the deal with a gently used Kyle Kuzma."
"Also forgot to mention NBA Champion Jared Dudley, NBA Champion Kyle Kuzma, and NBA Champion Talen Horton Tucker"
Kyle Kuzma with a better agent
A taller Kyle Kuzma
Today tho? I dont think even Kyle Kuzma wannabe Kyle Kuzma with all the slander he has been getting.

he's gonna trade away kyle kuzma jr too at this rate

2021/2022 DPOY Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma is distinctively bad.
The Jacksonville Jaguars trade their 2022 3rd round pick for the rights to Kyle Kuzma so he can take his talents to Florida
"i hate marvin bagley so much, i don’t know the guy so i don’t hate him as a person but essentially he’s got the attitude of a star with the game of less healthy kyle kuzma. his family is a discount ball family and he hasn’t progressed at all since being drafted. it hurts me even more knowing that one of our front office guys said we would have taken bagley at #1"
"Kyle Kuzma is, and always will be, a ""rhythm shooter"".  If he is allowed to spend 10 possessions getting into his flow he will get his shooting going.  Lakers have literally never been that or had any inclination to let that boy be out there for 10 possessions jacking up shots.  Otherwise he improved his passing and defense a lot these past two years."
Were those people Kyle kuzma?
"&gt;This year it was back down to 54% which is quite bad but still above his own average.  League median is only 57%.  Schroder could obviously be more efficient, but managing even 54% in their ""system"" this season was not bad.  Vogel has no offensive ideas beyond ""Isolate James and watch him"", ""Isolate Davis and let him shoot fadeaways"", and pick-and-rolls.  Everything else was just freelancing, like on a playground.  So for a good chunk of the season, Schroder was out with some combination of Wesley Matthews, Markieff Morris, Andre Drummond, Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma, and Caldwell-Pope and they were just making up whatever.  They were completely dependent on Schroder's ability to break down a defense and make something good happen, which he often did.  Even surrounded by that largely questionable offense, Schroder averaged 5.8 assists -- which is 26th in the League, and more than all but a couple secondary ball-handlers.  The very impressive company he's in there is: Steph Curry, Domantas Sabonis, Malcolm Brogdon, and Giannis Antetokounmpo."
There isn't a player Orlando dislikes more than Kyle Kuzma.
Kyle Kuzma about to become the centerpiece of their new regime.
"If I’m Kyle Kuzma I'm getting Drummond and Dudley.     Those 3 needa learn Spanish, German, or Mandarin before they are in the Chinese or Euro league next year"
"Starters: Brandon Jennings, Josh Richardson, Kyle Kuzma, Jahlil Okafor, Andre Drummond  Bench: Derrick Caracter, Anthony Randolph, Marcus Banks, Jon Brockman  Coach: Paul Silas"
He would be utterly dogshit Kyle Kuzma would never
So basically just Kyle Kuzma?
"Kyle Kuzma is a bum, however he’s still better at basketball than 99.9% of human beings to ever be born.   Delete this post, it’s just not a meaningful discussion at all"
Devin Booker on Kyle Kuzma: “ He destroyed us. That’s what it is. He had a hell of a game. That’s what he does.”
He thinks he is AD but plays like Kyle Kuzma

"Some fairly straightforward moves to make.  Strongly suggest for Trez to opt out of his player option using the Klutch + Rich Paul family connection. Let Drummond, Marc Gasol, and Morris walk.  Resign THT and Caruso long term for hopefully under $15mil/YR combined. Resign Wes and Benny Mac to another veteran’s minimum.  Re-do the entire front court. Look to sign two defensive minded PF/C that can rebound, rim protect, and not ask for post touches. Nerlen’s Noel and Richaun Holmes both could be affordable and available. Dwight Howard coming back would be fine as well.  See what’s available on the trade market. If POR is down to blow it up and sell off CJ McCollum I would resign Schroder and package him in a S+T with Kuzma and a 2022 FRP to acquire CJ.  If no trade partners are available I’d let Schroder walk and see if I can coax Kyle Lowry to signing a 2+1 deal for $20-$25mil/yr.  That’s about as good as you can do honestly."
Did Kyle Kuzma die?
KP and Kyle Kuzma are like two undercover agents hired by the opposite team to sabotage their teams like Rondo did when he was on the mavs
"Kyle Kuzma for Lillard and 5 firsts makes sense. It would really hurt to see Kuz go, but the return is almost equal!"
Kyle Kuzma
"[Lebron James] “Kyle Kuzma walked in the locker room, he walked by me, walked by Dennis Schrooder and he tapped Anthony Davis on the groin and he said with a smile, 'Have a good game brother' And he walked out. He seemed so kind and sweet until he put us in a chamber again."""
That’s Kyle better than Tatum Kuzma to you
Kyle Kuzma in shambles
Kyle Kuzma taunting Lakers fans all season that he could play basketball
"Or, hear me out. Lakers, Blazers, and Nuggets in a three team deal where the Lakers get Jokic, MPJ, and Dame and the Nuggets and Blazers get to split Kyle Kuzma."
"Randle, Wiggins, Jerami Grant, Kyle Lowry. Like this year Kuzma had his most efficient season ever, if he was given more touches he'd be playing better than his rookie year. He probably won't become a star in this league but he has above average role player right this second with potential to do what Jerami Grant does in Detroit."
Right now it’s probably CJ McCollum. Saw more than one person say he’s no better than Kyle Kuzma.
Kyle “Kudzu” Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma is just a Tayshaun Prince regen in 2k.
“Kyle Kuzma and maybe a first round pick. *Maybe*.”
Fuck Kyle kuzma
"""Trade Asset 3"" Lmao why couldn't you just say Kyle Kuzma"
"Listen, dont take what Im about to say as being mean towards you, but I dont give a fuck what the media said. The talking media heads are literally just hot take factories hoping something they spew will stick. Anyone with two eyes and a brain should have known Marc Gasol and Andre fucking Drummond were not going to be the reason for a potential Laker repeat. The team is objectively terrible outside of LB and AD (Caruso and KCP are honestly ok role players in my book) .  Also while on the topic of the media, remember at the start of the last season when the talking heads were claiming the Lakers stood no chance against the Clippers because their roster was so awful outside of the two stars, but as soon as the Lakers won it all the narrative immediately switched to, ""of course they won, the lakers are a great team with GOATS like Kyle Kuzma on the roster"".  But I genuinely think last years lakers were better. I think Rondo and Dwight brought something to that team that Scroder and Gasol are just incapable of replicating."
Why was Kyle Kuzma so awful?
Kyle Kuzma a Bum.
"Lakers got rid of Jordan Clarkson, Brandon ingram, Julius randle, Josh hart. Kept Kyle kuzma"
Fuck LeBron and especially fuck Kyle kuzma. From a magic fan.
"Kyle ""Eric Bledsoe"" Kuzma"
"Is Kyle Kuzma young? If yes then he is my answer.  And then, Jordan Poole, Kevin Porter, Kevin Huerter, Lonzo Ball.  Technically not an all star but is pretty much there is SGA and Ja."
"Kyle Kuzma might be the actual worst player in the NBA. If you're horrible from a skills standpoint, at least you know not to run out there like you can take over a game. Kuzma is just mediocre enough to think that he can go 11/21 if he shoots enough shots, and that's... not ideal."
Kyle Kuzma = Josh Jackson

"Man,  fuck Kyle Kuzma."
Fuk Kyle Kuzma!
"Kyle Kuzma or Dennis Schruder , both are untrustable. We just never know when they are gonna score."
How about a little Dennis Schroder S&amp;T + Kyle Kuzma for CJ?  Let’s see how badly POR wants to shake it up.
KYLE KUZMA
If Kyle Kuzma ends up in Orlando I think that'd be the only player I'd boo on my own team. A close second would be MCW attempting a contested three
Fuck Kyle Kuzma
You can always say he’s not the best basketball player of all time and that would put him in the same category as Kyle Kuzma
"Fellas, who would win:  Kyle Kuzma or Chris Smith?"
"that's still no reason to completely fucking give up.  which is exactly what the lakers did for about 7 and a half quarters. then they started clawing their way back.  then kyle kuzma made that shot/pass looking play in the 4th and then the lakers just said fuck this. fuck kyle kuzma, dude got drunk on hollywood pussy and just straight up turned into a highlight hunting doofus. ship his dumbass to orlando.  people love to shit on lebron right now because it's just what happens when the great ones fall and he does deserve most of it for his attitude/body language during the latter half of this series. at the same time, basketball is a team game and lebron's teammates completely shit the bed, including our coaching staff.  and people shitting on ad for getting hurt are fucking clowns. sure as hell don't see embiid getting shit for getting hurt."
"Kyle Kuzma trick y'all, man."
Daffy Duck has better BBIQ than Kyle Kuzma.
Wtf am I supposed to do with Kyle Kuzma?
[might have been something he said ](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2820976-kyle-kuzma-id-rather-be-talked-about-bad-in-la-than-irrelevant-in-orlando)
Probably Kyle kuzma
Man this sub must really hate Kyle Kuzma for there to be this many posts about a bench player
Lebron was absolutely gassed at that point. And I’m sure seeing the bs that is Kyle Kuzma made him just say fuck this shit.
Kyle Kuzma runs as if he was running on the moon
"Shout out to Stephen A Smith for Saying the Lakers should trade Kyle Kuzma for Devin Booker straight up. January 14, 2020."
"No, we’re good  Fuck Kyle kuzma"
"To Kyle Kuzma: ""Having you here is like losing two good players."""
Kyle Kuzma
He goes from prime Klay Thomson to Kyle Kuzma every other game and it mkaes no sense to me lmao
"Does the Lakers have any first round pick to give?  Schroder (Sign and Trade), Kyle Kuzma, Montrez Harrell, Thorton Tucker plus picks. Who says no?"
“Social media adds to that in a way because it seems young players are more motivated to play well for social status.”  This statement is so comical. No one highly educated would consider this a positive. I sincerely hope he’s a kid. I mean his favorite player seems to be Kyle Kuzma and he does think like Kyle Kuzma.
If fans push Dame outta Portland then they deserve Kyle Kuzma.
"Kyle Kuzma, KCP, and a 2023 2nd for Damian Lillard."
"I live in Portland, Maine and the Maine Red Claws are the G-League affiliate of the Celtics, for baseball you're thinking of the SeaDogs which are the doubleA affiliate for the Red Sox. enjoy Kyle Kuzma, stupid"
I mean Portland deserves Kyle Kuzma if they managed to run Dame outta town
Luke Kennard is the Clippers Kyle Kuzma
Either Andre Drummond or Kyle Kuzma   /s
I hope you like Dennis Schroeder and Kyle Kuzma!
Kyle Kuzma should be an honorable mention for the Lakers.
"Y'know what, fuck it: Kyle Kuzma for Connor McDavid, who says no"
"Even if you dont want to believe this specific situation, people take on salary for 1st round picks every offseason. Memphis took on 17m of Iguodala to not play a single minute for them and they were completely OK with it since they get a 1st round pick. I dont know why you are suggesting that taking on salary in exchange for getting a borderline mid round pick is suddenly a strange phenomenon in the NBA.  Harrell is a 9 million expiring the only real long term implication is 13m of kyle kuzma which isn't that problematic to cap space at the end of the day."
"Which is fair, but let's not act like there are any 2nd rounders that much better than Kyle Kuzma lol. Which was my point in regards to your OP."
"I mean Danny Green was 33 when you traded for him, but you found a way to flip him. I dont think Kyle Kuzma is that unflippable on his current deal even if you dont think hes that good"
"Why? He averaged 13 ppg with 36% shooting from 3 last year. I’m not expecting him to be an all star or anything. In theory, I look at it as Kyle Kuzma has a pretty good chance of being better than whoever I pick in the second round. In actuality, no way Kyle Kuzma would be happy going from LA to OKC so I retract my original comment lol"
They first stole Kyle Kuzma but he was too high Maintenance so they let him go
He's been like one of their best defenders this year lol. LeBron and AD missed so many games due to injuries. And yet they still ended up with the best ranked defense while featuring the last remains of Marc Gasol and the prehistoric dinosaur no one is scared of in Andre Drummond.  There isn't that many 2nd rounders that can end up better than Kyle Kuzma lol.
"Popularity is still not a good factor. Russell westbrook ""brings more fans"" than Trae young to games. Is Russell westbrook better than Trae young rn then? Nah. Did you know Kyle Kuzma is for some reason crazy popular in China? Worldwide he's definitely more famous than Trae. Is Kyle kuzma a superstar rn? Hell nah."
This is the trade they proposed:   76ERS GET DENNIS SCHRÖDER  KYLE KUZMA  MONTREZL HARRELL  TALEN HORTON-TUCKER  LAKERS GET  BEN SIMMONS
"He wasn't a 30 pct FT shooter until this series. His issues are fine as long as he isn't literally the worst FT shooter of all time by a large factor.  The Sixers win in 5 games if Simmons is merely a Shaq-level FT shooter. Is he just now going to be a 30 pct FT shooter for the rest of his career or is that a small sample, something that can be fixed? I would certainly take the risk that it's the latter instead of trading him for some garbage players like THT and Kyle Kuzma."
"He gonna be backup PG for the Shangai Sharks       Starting 5 of Ben Simmons, Joe Harris, Kyle Kuzma, Kristaps Porzingis, Andre Drummomd"
Kyle Kuzma is an outstanding basketball player. He would really help your team win. I would strongly advise teams to trade for him this summer.
More like kyle kuzma or vets

His Cousin is honestly a liability. Offensively he is non-existing and defensively he is very good but the O is a real problem. Blevins Cousin for KyLe KuZma and A 1 RoUnD PiCk.  Edit: WhO SaYs nO?
"this is awful  &gt; * Lakers get: Ben Simmons &gt; * 76ers get: Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley III &gt; * Kings get: Kyle Kuzma, Talen-Horton Tucker, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, first-round pick"
I just wanna say that Kyle Kuzma sucks.

The Kyle kuzma special: they told the man he needed to be more consistent so he became consistently awful
*Kyle Kuzma has entered the chat*
Ah yes the running argument on r/lakers over which All-Star they should trade Kyle Kuzma for
i’d like to offer a lightly used Kyle Kuzma
"Kyle Kuzma, KCP, and #22"
"Oh I'm sorry, can we please offer you a package centered around our best assets with you sending back some combination of Kyle Kuzma and Wesley Matthews?!?! Maybe a 2nd round pick if you are feeling generous?!"
They should trade him and start over. Luckily I have an NBA Champion I can offer in exchange. One Kyle Kuzma.
Sixers say no as bad as Simmons stock is right now Kyle Kuzma hasn't proven anything besides occasionally scoring 20 points
Remember when Kyle Kuzma was totally untouchable
until the next superstar signs with them to play with kyle kuzma
They should be forced to trade all their good players to LA and NYC for Kyle Kuzma and Kevin Knox!
"Offseason focus  What is the pecking order in free agency? Half of those on the roster are free agents  Creativity in the offseason with limited options outside of their own players  What is the final cost of this roster?  Draft assets  First: 22  Future: The Lakers owe New Orleans an unprotected first in 2022. In addition, the Pelicans have the right to swap in 2023 plus an unprotected first via Los Angeles in 2024. The Pelicans have the right to defer the 2024 first-rounder until 2025. The Lakers can trade their 2021 first-round pick after making the selection. They are also allowed to trade first-round picks in 2027 or 2028 (but not both of them).  Cash: $5.6 million (to send) | $5 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  The Lakers have four players -- LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- who will combine to earn $102M in 2021-22. Along with the $9.7 million player option of Montrezl Harrell and their own first-round pick, the Lakers will enter the offseason $14.5 million below the luxury tax, but with eight open roster spots to fill.  If they elect to bring back their own free agents, including Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker, they will be in the luxury tax for a second consecutive season. The total cost of salaries and luxury tax could reach close to $275 million.  If Los Angeles balks at the price of each player, it will have only the $9.5 million midlevel exception along with the veteran minimum exception available to use. However, the Lakers would be hard capped if they use more than $5.9 million of the midlevel. The biannual exception was used last offseason on Wesley Matthews and is not available.  The hard cap restriction still applies (the Lakers are $509K below) and will get lifted on Aug. 3. The poison pill restriction for Kyle Kuzma also gets lifted on that same day. Harrell has until Aug. 1 to opt in to his contract. There is no offseason guaranteed date on the $1.8 million contract of Alfonzo McKinnie.  Team needs  Starting and backup point guard  Bench depth at every position  Extension eligible: Alfonzo McKinnie  Free-agent status  Dennis Schroder | Bird  Montrezl Harrell | Player | Non Bird  Wesley Matthews | Non Bird  Alex Caruso | Bird  Ben McLemore | Non Bird  Andre Drummond | Non Bird  Talen Horton-Tucker | Restricted | Early Bird  Markieff Morris | Early Bird  Jared Dudley | Early Bird  Devontae Cacok | Restricted | Early Bird  Kostas Antetokounmpo Restricted | Early Bird"
Kyle Kuzma
somewhere out there kyle kuzma just sneezed
Kyle Kuzma I want to see what working with Pop can do to him
Kyle Kuzma 🧢
Kyle ‘Budget’ Kuzma
nobody would care about alex caruso or kyle kuzma or any of the other laker cast-off players if they weren't on the lakers.  also it's fucking stupid that we're still arresting people for marijuana possession in 2021.
we'll take him for a freshly bleached kyle kuzma and a 1st
"Okay captain obvious yeah, any player is technically ready if their team is good enough. Fuckin Kyle Kuzma won a ring because his team was good enough. No shit.   Point is Lebron’s team wasn’t ready, Kobe’s team was."

Kyle Kuzma for Cade Cunningham?
2019 Injured groin  2021 Kyle Kuzma
"ya I get what you mean and in a situation like a free dunk ya that person basically doesnt deserve much credit. in a lot of other situations even involving open shots its much less clear. if someone drives and kicks to a 3pt shooter who is open they do still deserve a lot of credit for the play, but whether you are passing to Klay thompson or Kyle kuzma is a big difference and thats why someone like Klay still deserves a lot of credit even if their stats are a result of someone else creating a play. I think the situations where the player who scored deserves little credit are the exception. But ya I think we can agree how good someone is at ""playmaking"" is really hard to measure"
Ben Simmons to the Lakers (maybe). Lakers trade Schroeder and Kyle Kuzma.
"I think Paul George, Danny Green and Kyle Kuzma all get roasted pretty equally. It seems especially bad right now since it's fresh, but I'm sure that in a few months once the season starts again and Ben has his first good game it'll calm down."
Ben Simmons for Kyle kuzma
Danny green and Ben Simmons for Kyle Kuzma
"I know Simmons tanked his value but so did Kuzma. You're getting heated for a trade built around Kyle Kuzma for Ben Simmons. LeBron wants to win now, he wants proven players. In no timeline a trade like that happens. On top of that who are we trading for Ben?"
Trade Kyle Kuzma for Ben Simmons??!?!
What was his contract again? I'm sure he can be held accountable for his stat line. Considering he take a huge portion of the dearly cap space on that team. He is an over glorified Kyle Kuzma.
"I’d like to see a super team of Simmons, Joe Harris, Kyle kuzma, and porzingas"
KyLe KuZmA aNd BeN SiMmOnS gOnNa TeAr It Up FoR tHe GuAnGdOnG tIgErS hahahahaa /s
I know people say that but how far down the roster can you go before it starts becoming ridiculous and harmful? Like does Kyle Kuzma think he's better than LeBron? Does Thanasis think he's better than Giannis?
ok KYLE KUZMA.  &amp;#x200B;  /s
Kyle Kuzma.
"Stephen A last yr ""The Suns need to trade Booker for Kyle Kuzma"""
Not sure if you’re being sarcastic but LeBron practically traded everyone not named Kyle Kuzma for AD
Shanghai Sharks starting lineup next year:  PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Kelly Oubre  SF: Joe Mama  PF: Kyle Kuzma  C: Andre Drummond  Book it.
Terrance “Tyler “Kyle kuzma” herro” mann
"Your not wrong. He gets exposed hardcore every playoffs, everyone calls it out for a day then forgets 24 hours later. Kyle kuzma should go play for the jazz since they seem to love over paying overrated players."
Kyle Kuzma
Guangdong Tigers with Kyle kuzma
"Not all, but some Lakers fans have the worst takes ever. I’ve honest to god, have been apart of a conversation where a Lakers fan literally said “I would MAYBE trade Dennis Schroeder, and Kyle Kuzma for JAYSON TATUM.”   When you have the hands down #1 bandwagon team in the NBA, and possibly all of American sports, you’re going to consist of a way larger population of delusional “fans” than any other fan base."
"I still can’t believe people use to debate Jayson Tatum, Kyle Kuzma, and Ben Simmons once upon a time"
Kyle Kuzma would have dunked that
Simmons is a Kyle Kuzma that went #1
Is Ben Simmons the Kyle Kuzma of the East?
"You're forgetting the 6th man, Kyle Kuzma"
Ben Simmons and Kyle Kuzma about to be some studs on the Shanghai Sharks
Ben Simmons &amp; Kyle Kuzma about to be teammates in China.
"# ben simmons has lost all confidence, i can sincerely say that i would rather have kyle kuzma, atleast he’s not afraid to let it fly"
Kyle Kuzma would have dunked that...off the back rim.  But at least he'll still try. I mean dude tried to go one on one with MPJ. Confidence is not the issue
Well Kyle Kuzma isn’t getting paid $30 million
Who's more trash? Kyle Kuzma or Ben Simmons?
"Ben Simmons gives me Kyle Kuzma vibes, just trash..."
Would you rather have Ben Simmons or Kyle Kuzma though
The media said he would have no problem shooting over Jesus too? Kyle kuzma is just insufferable and his fashion sense is cringe.
"Kyle Kuzma is making 13m, and Dinwiddie has proven he can be a 20ppg scorer. I would be very surprised if he got under 15m"
U comparin Kyle kuzma to Kyrie?
"No, it's not obvious. You could also be a disgruntled Lakers fan who thinks I'm saying the current Lakers are an equivalently stacked team to the Nets, and are asking who the third star is besides Anthony Davis and Lebron, and referencing Kyle Kuzma or somebody else with an embarrassingly bad shooting percentage.  Harden was obviously injured in this case, trying to bash him for having a bad last few games is a really bad look for you."
"Kyle Kuzma was hilariously bad. He seem to completely forget how to shoot, defend, pass and play basic team basketball."
What y’all think about the new Shanghai Sharks roster next season?  PG: Ben Simmons  SG: Joe Harris  SF: Kyle Kuzma  PF: Kristaps Porzingis  C: Rudy Gobert  6M: Dennis Schroeder
Joe Harris and Kyle Kuzma in Shanghai about to be lit.
He shot like Steph Curry shooting for charity  He shot like Kyle Kuzma today  He shot like Lonzo Ball before he fixed his form.
Joe Harris looking like Kyle Kuzma
"Imagine other team’s management, analyzing all of the lakers young talent and requesting Kuzma instead of Lonzo and Ingram - ultimately picking Kyle as their best option.  Durrr 🤪😂"
Wiseman is going to get traded to the Lakers for Kyle Kuzma.
Kyle Kuzma: Playing basketball is hard
"Would the Magic and Lakers consider a Kyle Kuzma for Terrence Ross swap? Magic are rebuilding and loading up on young pieces, while Ross would be a great fit as the third scorer for the Lakers.   **Lakers:** KCP, Ross, Bron, AD, some centre?   **Magic young talent depth chart:**  PG: Fultz, Anthony.  SG: Hampton, hopefully BJ Boston at 33.  SF: Kuzma, Franz Wagner.  PF: Kuminga, Okeke.   C: WCJ, Bamba."
Kyle Kuzma needs opportunity
"Honestly, Kyle Kuzma and Trae Youngs 3pa/3pm stats are very similar with Kuzma pulling ahead by a small amount. I understand Traes shots might be more contested, but they take similar amounts per game."
Kyle Kuzma is hated because people mad he is a pretty boy and plays for the Lakers.
"Sure, agreed and I understand what I think you’re trying to say: if Kyle Kuzma had a more realistic perception of his ability, he may be a more successful NBA player. No arguments there, and not every player needs the all star mentality to be successful. Alex Caruso comes to mind as someone who doesn’t think of himself as an all star yet most would agree he’s successful. I’m just trying to suggest some people are wired differently and need to think that way, and for Kuzma, he may not even be in the league if he didn’t have that confidence in himself."
Fuck Kyle kuzma
"I agree with this , we need help difuse US-China tension so we can ship Kyle Kuzma to CBA fast and smoothly"
is this the real kyle kuzma? I like you’re IG fits bro
I swear like 25% of people on this sub genuinely think they’re a better basketball player than Kyle Kuzma
kyle kuzma had to grow up too fast; he didn’t have a normal first 5 years in the league to develop
Kyle Kuzma
It would be funny to see Kyle Kuzma come after Shannon Sharpe with mamas cooking.
"Kyle Kuzma got 13 yr, Joe Harris got 18, the fact that people think a 20ppg scorer is getting less than 13 himself - even post ACL tear - is not based in reality  Especially if the cap spikes like it’s predicted"
"Kyle Kuzma: ""I'm a moron"""
"&gt; Kyle Kuzma: ~~""It's hard to be consistent in an inconsistent role""~~""It's hard to be good when I am mediocre.""  Fixed."
So I went to high school w/ Kawhi and am close friends with Castleberry. You didn't hear it from me but Kawhi is not staying. He is looking to win and that is why he will be joining Kyle Kuzma to play for the Shanghai Sharks
Melo for Kyle Kuzma. Who says no?
Kyle Kuzma looks like if you tried to draw Amber Rose from memory
The answer is *easily* Kyle Kuzma. And that says more about Drummond than it does about Kuz tbh.
"So, what do you propose he does to make the team better? I never said he makes his teammates exceptionally better. But if all you have to do is catch and shoot open 3’s and you can’t even do that on a league average level, you are worthless.    You want to take Kyle Kuzma from us? Let’s do a swap for Ingram and compare notes"
lmao 37yo Melo &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; however the fuck old Kyle Kuzma is
He's the Kyle Kuzma of the Bucks
"I’m so happy this dumbass made the worst possible move and picked the lakers seriously showed the world how low his IQ is. They already had Anthony Davis, Montrez Harrell, Marc Gasol, Kyle Kuzma, Markief Morris and despite not being a big man Lebron James needs to get into the paint to be effective. Andre the certified idiot thought the lakers would just drop everything and let him play over all these veterans who have developed chemistry with the team all season long. The part that makes it even more dumb is how many other contending teams were in need for a rebounding center like Drummond but he just seriously has no brain up there . You did this to yourself now go sulk in the corner and cry about it all off season long before signing a 1 year deal with the Houston rockets ya bum"
Can this dude go fuck himself lol. I haven't wanted to punch my screen as hard as I have seeing this idiot play with the Lakers.  And this is a team where you have to put up with the Kyle Kuzma experience
Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma pre-Lebron and when Lebron was hurt.
"Dennis Schroeder, Kyle Kuzma trade package would have “little appeal” to Blazers"
"Not from the states, don't know exactly how these trades work and i am just spouting jibbrish based on Google maps.  Mile lacs Lake, Green Lake and Upper red lake in exchange for Kyle Kuzma, Long Beach and a suburb of choiche?"
"disrespectful to Draymond, he would never pass up an open dunk or hide from the ball all game in a game 7 lmao (Simmons hid from the ball the entire Hawks series tbh).  I can sincerely say that I would rather have Kyle Kuzma than Ben Simmons. At least he is not afraid to let it fly"
"Lebron could have dragged a team composed of Tyler Ulis, Marquese Chris, and Dragan Bender to the playoffs? If he couldn't drag Lonzo, Kyle Kuzma, and Brandon Ingram then what more that Suns team imo."
This guy is becoming the next Kyle Kuzma except he is making a max contract.  Philly better get rid of him quick before he goes full Kuzma mode and starts dying his hair different colors every week.  It's in your hands Morey!🙏
Would you rather find five dollars on the ground or have your team acquire kyle kuzma through free agency for a reasonable contract
If you're perennially clowned Kyle Kuzma there is a 0% chance you understand what's happening better than LeBron.
Okay? I don’t care. I’m saying Lebron bitching is not as bad as Kyle Kuzma losing the capability of being a human being on the court
I'll never understand why anyone would trade D'Angelo Russell for Kyle Kuzma.
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De’Aaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4.

He’s either Kyle Kuzma Or Michael Jordan. There’s no inbetween
Dude  either plays like Kyle Kuzma or MJ. There is no in between.
"Between picks 21-30 seems like you have maybe a 35% chance on hitting at least a rotation player, and then maybe 10-15% on getting a really legitimate piece.   1/3 might not seem super high, but that’s also at a very low salary that you have a ton of control over.   **2011**  Mirotic (23rd)  Reggie Jackson (24th)  Cory Joseph (29th)  Butler (30th)  **2012**  *no one notable*  **2013**  THJ (24th)  Reggie Bullock (25th)  Roberson (26th)  Gobert (27th)   **2014**  Capela (25th)  Bogdan Bogdanovic (27th)  Kyle Anderson (30th)  **2015**  Bobby Portis (22nd)  RHJ (23rd)  Tyus Jones (24th)  Nance (27th)  Looney (30th)  **2016**  Korkmaz (26th)  Siakam (27th)  Dejounte Murray (30th)  **2017**  Jarrett Allen (22nd)  OG (23rd)  Kuzma (27th)  Derrick White (29th)  Josh Hart (30th)  **2018**  Grayson Allen (21st)  Aaron Holiday (23rd)  Simons (24th)  Shamet (26th)  Robert Williams (27th)  **2019**  Clarke (21st)  Bazley (23rd)  Keldon Johnson (29th)  KPJ (30th)  **2020**  Maxey (21st)  Nnaji (22nd)  Hampton (24th)  Quickley (25th)  Printchard (26th)  Bane (30th)"
Lebron is second option to Kyle kuzma
I’m down for a straight trade for Kyle kuzma. Shit u can have Jared Dudley too haha jk I’m drunk.
Trade Garland and Sexton along with 4 first round picks to the Lakers for Kyle Kuzma!! 😏
Rajon Rondo  DeMar DeRozan  James Johnson  Kyle Kuzma  Clint Capela  Ricky Rubio  Bradley Beal  Bojan Bogdanovic  Al-Farouq Aminu  Kosta Koufos  Jarrett Jack  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Kyle Korver  Gerald Green  Markieff Morris  Marcus Morris  Bismack Biyombo  Tristan Thompson
"How about Kyle kuzma, KCP and a 2nd?"
If they ask for that then say no(if you truly believe the 4th pick will end up being better)  You wont get anything close to simmons from any other team. Best you could get is Kyle Kuzma or Terrance Mann
Ok. Kyle Kuzma will be the face of the league soon
Kyle Kuzma is the Toni Kukoc of this era.
"I can't, I'm already engaged to Kyle Kuzma."

Kyle Kuzma because I have brain damage
Didn’t Kyle Kuzma date here?
I'd give up on my team too if I had Kyle Kuzma
Kyle kuzma for pat bev is a horrible trade for the lakers .
Enter Kyle Kuzma.
Search Kyle Kuzma on Twitter and it's 99% hate.
"We're doing the Blazers a favor to give them some used tape and Kyle Kuzma for their franchise cornerstone, believe me"
"Seriously though, Kyle Kuzma is an extremely valuable asset and **MIND YOU** have all star potential. Dude's career high is **41**. With the right team, Kuzma can go off and blow his haters away. I think he fits just right in with a team that needs a first option. What better team there is than the very hungry Guangdong Tigers."
But the Lakers could trade them Kyle Kuzma AND a first!
Kyle Kuzma does not his own sneaker. He helped design a silhouette
Kyle Kuzma
"Kyle Kuzma has reportedly purchased a $17.5 million East Coast outpost in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia."
Sometimes they're John Collins and Kyle Kuzma
Kyle kuzma on the bucks benhc ???
He talking about him and Kyle Kuzma running it back with the Shanghai Sharks
"Nah fam. The Lakers are still great and will mostly make the Finals again, but don’t gloss over the fact that Drummond is a 6’ 11” Kyle Kuzma. For the Lakers sake, bench Drummond or kick Vogel to the curb"
"you're underestimating the influence of player empowerment though. in the end, if AD said he was going to the lakers, he was going to the lakers, even if the pels had to take a bunch of first-round picks that would land in the 20's and kyle kuzma for it."
I would gladly take Looney over f'ing Kyle Kuzma
"He was drafted and loved the same Lakers scouting department that drafted gems like Kuzma, Thomas Bryant, Zubac, Josh Hart, Julius Randle, and Larry Nance later in the draft. Or the fact that Frank Vogel who is one of the smartest coaches in league love him. Or he’s being developed by Phil Handy the best development coach in the league that has specifically worked with Kawhi, Lebron, Kyrie, Kobe, Kyle Lowry, and Anthony Davis. Or the fact that he rates in the 96th percentile according the Basketball Index in his getting to the rim rating. Or the fact he’s getting personally mentored by Lebron. There’s definitely a chance for the kid to succeed but have fun with your day."
Cade for Kyle Kuzma and KCP who says no
MPJ is a more mature Kyle Kuzma.... but he’s still kinda like Kyle Kuzma.
Kyle kuzma and a 2nd round pick..you cant say no to that - Lakers sub
"&gt; If the Blazers are a believer, the Lakers could have some traction. Horton-Tucker can earn up to about $33-$46 million over three or four years via sign-and-trade. Portland would have a team salary limit at roughly $143 million for the 2021-22 season, which should not be an issue. &gt;  &gt; The Lakers would need to include additional salary, starting with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Kyle Kuzma. Others, like Montrezl Harrell (if he opts into his final year at $9.7 million) and Alfonzo McKinnie ($1.9 million, some of which would need to be guaranteed) could round out a deal, especially if the Blazers were willing to include center Jusuf Nurkic, who notably told a Bosnian media outlet if Lillard is out, he's out. &gt;  &gt; The Lakers also have the No. 22 pick, which can be dealt in August when Horton-Tucker is eligible for a sign-and-trade (legally, Los Angeles would not be able to select a player at Portland's direction). The Lakers can also send one of their 2027 or 2028 first-rounders and five of their next seven second-rounders (through 2028).  Imagine trading Dame and Nurkic for pricy rotation players, the 22nd pick, and a future 1st.  That's basically what the Raptors were requesting for a couple months of Lowry."
"It probably was intentional. He did the same exact thing to Kyle Kuzma in the Lakers series. Plus, Crowder is notorious for doing shit like this"
Kyle kuzma
Except the Ws aren’t offering Kyle Kuzma. They’re offering actual lottery picks.
Who the fuck wants Kyle Kuzma  He had one of the all time worst playoff performances this year
We think Kyle Kuzma can be traded for anything more than a paper clip right now
"Weird fit aside, Trading kcp for Westbrook feels like an upgrade. If anybody knows how to make a weird fit work it's going to be LeBron, and they will be pretty awesome at rebounding/inside game.  It isn't like the shambling corpse of Kyle kuzma was going to get you anywhere compared to the presumably healthy next year superteam Nets and the Bucks with giannis unlocked and the Warriors coming back with Klay."
Calls on Laker for trading away Kyle Kuzma
"Not to go against your theory but something to add to the conversation,  Eric Pincus:  &gt; Over the past few weeks, the Lakers pursued Westbrook and Hield in parallel conversations with the Wizards and Sacramento Kings. As the draft neared, the Wizards seemed content to wait on big decisions with Beal and Westbrook.  &gt; That pushed Hield to the forefront. But even as the possibility of a deal built around Kyle Kuzma and Harrell began to form, the Lakers kept the door open to a Westbrook deal.  &gt; Westbrook asserted his voice into the conversation, and per an NBA source, the Wizards pivoted. Just like that, the pieces the Kings liked for Hield were no longer available.  [source](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2946554-biggest-questions-and-answers-from-blockbuster-lakers-russell-westbrook-trade), [via](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/7/29/22601297/russell-westbrook-plan-b-lakers-trade-rumors-offseason-free-agency-buddy-hield-chris-paul)"
Kyle “not cp3” Kuzma
"I know it's a popular refrain, but who exactly does LeBron make better? Here are a few examples,   George Hill was traded to the Cavs as part of a last ditch attempt to recalibrate a dysfunctional Cavs team. The movement in his efficiency was as follows: -2.5/-10 FG/3PT% and this was on effectively the same FGA/3PTA  Kyle Kuzma effectively peaked efficiency wise in his rookie year, when LeBron wasn't even on the team, and proceeded to get worse the following years.  Starting: 45/36.6 FG/3PT% and averaging: -1/-4 FG/3PT%. This is in spite of Kuzma being a 2nd year player when LeBron joined his team - you'd expect him to get better not worse.   Rodney hood: +2.5/-3.7 FG/3PT%. Worth noting also that his offensive production dipped significantly, by over 6 points, with that in mind it appears to be a decline to me.   These are a few examples and I could go on, but Lebron's teammates almost always declined relative to expectations when playing next to him as noted here by ESPN   (https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23684417/kevin-pelton-weekly-mailbag-does-lebron-james-make-teammates-better)   My view: LeBron plays a very unique style of basketball where he has to have the ball in his hands the entire time and dump the ball off to his teammates when **he** seems necessary.  Consequently, playing with LeBron is tough because it involves a lot of ball watching. Players get cold playing with him and thus do not benefit much from the catch &amp; shoot 3s that he generates as they can't catch a rhythm.   The players that DO benefit from this are players who don't need the ball to be effective. That is why players like JR and Larry Nance played much better than expected with LeBron, because their game just requires they get an open look or an alley oop.  This is why Westbrook likely won't work with LeBron. Neither know how to play off ball, and Westbrook is a horrific catch and shoot player, so he doesn't benefit from what LeBron does best."
How do people just lie and get upvoted on here? The guy got traded for the worst contract in the league twice in a row and just got traded for kyle fucking kuzma  This guy is suppose to be an “MVP”
"Bro you traded Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl and KCP for Russ - even if you don't like him as a player i don't think the Lakers have become worse from this trade."
I’m so hyped to watch Kyle Kuzma lace it up for us said nobody in the DMV 😭😭
(Bubble) NBA Champion* Kyle Kuzma
"I love how everyone just thinks the Lakers don’t have a plan to acquire shooters. Also everyone that’s played with Russ loves being his teammate besides KD. Just bizarre that people think it’s going to be a disaster adding Russell Westbrook who is miles better than Dennis Schroeder, Kyle kuzma, Montrez Harrell, or KCP will hurt their team. Such reactionary takes. Russ’ game will definitely change and he has a top 3 pnr big to run with when lebron is off the court."
"Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell and KCP altogether averaged 18 points, 9 boards, and 2 assists per game in the playoffs  Westbrook averaged 19, 10 and 11.   I think we'll live without the less than 20 points a game provided by that trio. Also all of them shot bad in the playoffs. Westbrook shot better from 3 than KCP did in the playoffs.   I'm not buying that the Lakers lost any player of such great value that they can't go find it on minimum contracts."
¿FUCK KYLE KUZMA?
LA champion Kyle Kuzma\*
So who becomes the Kyle Kuzma of the west?
"As Kyle Kuzma said, barbecue chicken"
I wonder how Bradley Beal feels about his new teammate Kyle Kuzma
"if you really think about it, the Wizards traded the worst contract in the nba (john wall) and a heavily protected first round pick for a solid 3&amp;D, an expiring, and kyle kuzma. not bad at all"
Kyle Kuzma 2022 NBA ALL STAR Confirmed
"that lliterally has a name called kuuuuuz, after kyle kuzma, made years ago way before lebron came   again, flairless bitches always talk the most shit"
Hell yeah Magic bros fuck Kyle Kuzma
"He got rid of 2 guys that got played off the court in the playoffs. Kyle “0 points, but I’m better than Tatum” Kuzma"
There is absolutely no reason to accept a trade involving Kyle Kuzma
They accepted Kyle Kuzma in an earlier trade. Who tf knows what they’re thinking
Can finally stop seeing Kyle Kuzma for X player rumors!
Sizers over here acting like Ben Simmons is Kyle Kuzma and THT combined.
No because they would trade their superstar in Kyle kuzma
Why go into a bidding war for Kyle fucking Kuzma lol
You're finna get Ben Simmons and Kyle Kuzma which is certainly a comparison of players
"They plan to build around their new team. Presenting the ~~Lakers~~ I mean, the Wizards. Built around former Laker players.   PG: 22nd pick   SG: Caldwell Pope   SF: Isaac Bonga  PF: Kyle Kuzma  C: Thomas Bryant      6th Man: Montrezl Harrell"
why would they trade a very good shooter for kyle kuzma
"Maaaaaaan, don't talk to me bout no Kyle Kuzma"
"The Los Angeles Lakers are nearing a deal with the Washington Wizards to acquire Russell Westbrook for Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a 2021 first-round pick, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski."
Kyle Kuzma really would be the quintessential Wizards player 😂
Kyle kuzma might as well be Steph curry compared to Westbrook
Maybe we can finally stop hearing about Kyle Kuzma all the time.
Kyle kuzma is everywhere man
"From what I’m hearing, Kyle Kuzma is being traded to 3 different team simultaneously"
Future 2 time champ Kyle Kuzma
Ok so they gonna make Beals running mate Kyle Kuzma during his contract year?
Hey Beal we want to build around you so we traded your star point guard for Kyle Kuzma 😃
"he gets to play with Kyle Kuzma, why would he leave?"
Kings legend Kyle kuzma
"Woj Tweeted Russell Westbrook for Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a 2021 first-round pick, sources tell ESPN.  That feels like so little for Westbrook, why would the wizards do this? Are they going to move Beal too and go full rebuild?"
just want to say Fuck Kyle Kuzma
"A three team deal with Lakers, Kings, and Wizards works.  Wizards receive: Buddy Hield, Kyle Kuzma, KCP, 22nd pick  Lakers receive: Westbrook  Kings receive: Montrez Harrel  You can swap Harell, Kuzma, and KCP around among the Wizards/Kings as long as Kings receive 1 and the Wizards receive 2."
Kings legend Kyle Kuzma?????
Kyle Kuzma and Trez both play for the wizards and kings

The Kyle Kuzma strategy
He’s worth 1 Kyle kuzma.

Ben Simmons for Kyle kuzma
Kyle Kuzma- Professional turtle
"He has the tools and athleticism of guys like Draymond, Kawhi, and more recently, Patrick Williams, but the poor decision making of Kyle Kuzma"
Kyle kuzma and pack of chips
"Because people misconstrue what 'position-less basketball' is  Position-less basketball is like in a line up of Lebron, Kuzma, KCP, AD, Drummond even though traditionally Lebron is a 3, he's playing PG  And in the Mav's roster last year when there wasn't an elite playmaker besides Doncic he is the defacto PG  but when you have a CP3, or Kyle Lowry who are small elite playmakers ofcourse your small elite playmaker is your PG, he can't play as anything else."
May I interest you in one 22nd pick with a throw-in of one Kyle Alexander Kuzma?  &amp;#x200B;  /s
the last time kyle kuzma played home games in orlando he won a ring...
"If Kyle Kuzma was asleep, he just woke up in a cold sweat"
Kyle Kuzma is falling and he's falling hard
"There has never been a single moment in time where that has been even a halfway decent trade suggestion lmfao. He even said Kyle Kuzma, plus some other players, plus maybe a pick or two. Like, none of that is worth anything lmao. Certainly not worth Booker. Absolutely laughable take, and I'm glad Max kinda shut it down lol"
Yeah giving Lebron a top 5 spot up shooter for Kyle Kuzma and a magic bean is definitely what Utah wants to do.
"Yea i think he changed name to kyle kuzma though, should look to get him!"
Breaking: Devin Booker to be traded to Los Angeles Lakers for Kyle Kuzma and KCP

Kyle Kuzma getting better trade offers than Ben Simmons is pretty hilarious.
Also Kyle Kuzma
2018 Lonzo Ball  2018 Brandon Ingram  2018 Kyle Kuzma  2018 Josh Hart  Whatever year Ryan Hollins
"Kyle Kuzma is a good rotation player, and paying a rotation player 13M isn't that terrible. He hustles like hell, plays solid team defense (and has grown tremendously in that department for all you people saying Kuzma has only gotten worse), and compliments LeBron and AD well as a cutter. His shooting is inconsistent, yes, but he's just nowhere near as bad as this sub makes him out to be."
&gt;I think the Wolves are much better off trying to develop Jaden McDaniels tbh   You really think we were gonna give up Jaden for Kyle fucking Kuzma? lmao  Also Kuz is a PF and Jaden is a natural SF so they don't overlap.
Regardless if its KD out there or any random NBA bench players: Theyre gonna FUCKING MOP the semi-pros with like a couple days of practice. The gap between NBA talent and a bunch of semi pros with 9-5s is gargantuan.    Throwing 3 kyle kuzma level players on the floor would fucking annihilate those teams.
My opinion of Kyle Kuzma is higher than most but man oh man do I not want him on the Wolves. I think they dodged a bullet with that one.
"I know right, that sub is full of mostly raptors fans (for some fucking reason) talking about Ben as if he was Kyle Kuzma.    Just joking, the 6ers and celtics are not known to like each other!"
"Yes, that is. Nobody wants Kyle Kuzma or Kantavious Caldwell Pope lol"
Wasnt there a recent thread that showed Kyle Kuzma hot more 3s than Young past year?
"My assumption is that the Spurs sign-and-trade Demar DeRozan (let's say... $66m over 3 years?) to the Lakers for Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Once they fill out the other parts of the roster, Ellington is an extremely savvy option."
What impact does this have on any potential Kyle Kuzma trade?
"No, we ain't taking fuckin Kyle Kuzma who's for a big extension. LMFAO."
"[Not according to Shams' reporting:](https://hoopshype.com/rumor/lakers-kings-have-discussed-buddy-hield-kyle-kuzma-trade/)  &gt; The Lakers have received interest from several teams regarding Kuzma, sources said."
"&gt; if ppl wanted him then he would already be traded, Woj literally said he was offered to every team and no one wants that negative asset so far lol  That is definitely not ""literally"" what Woj said. He said the Lakers have brought him and KCP up in trade talks with everyone, which is not surprising as they're basically the only guys the Lakers are allowed to talk about right now. They're not offering LeBron and AD to anyone, so the only other guys currently under contract with the Lakers for next year are Marc Gasol, Alfonzo McKinnie (both of whom make the minimum), and then KCP and Kuzma. So if they're talking to other teams, as they should be, that's literally all they are allowed to talk about.   As for why nobody has traded for them yet, that's because a lot of whom they're interested in can't be talked to yet as they're free agents (like Kyle Lowry, for example). And on top of that, one of their best trade chips, the 22nd pick, can't be moved until after the draft. Additionally, they also *may* have Montrezl Harrell to offer in trades, but he has to decide if he's opting in or not first, and they're prohibited from talking to their own free agents about new contracts or sign and trades.   It would be stupid for the Lakers to be making trades now before the draft or free agency when they don't yet have their full compliment of trade assets, just as it would be for any team. That's why we haven't seen hardly any trades from anyone yet. So you can cling to this idea that ""nobody wants Kuzma"" if you want to, but I'm telling you that you're gonna be wrong and end up looking foolish for this take in about a week or so."
"So thats the criteria we are going on now? If a player can guard KD or Lebron? Ok so that narrows it down to about zero players in the league, cool.  I'll keep bringing the conversation back to the actual trade on hand, do you think Kyle fucking Kuzma can guard either of these guys either? lol Kuzma is a terrible defender as well, just a bigger one. Terrible argument."
"&gt;So whatever source said that   It's the same one the OP listed above:  https://hoopshype.com/lists/nba-draft-trade-talks-kyle-kuzma-montrezl-harrell-gary-trent-jr-tyus-jones/  Here's exactly what was said:  &gt; Montrezl Harrell’s decision on his $9.7 million player option is considered a genuine “50-50” either way at this stage, multiple league sources told HoopsHype.  &gt; Harrell could exercise his player option and be traded. The Lakers and Kings have discussed a deal centered on Kyle Kuzma and Buddy Hield, as The Athletic’s Shams Charania reported. Multiple league sources told HoopsHype that Harrell and the Lakers’ 22nd overall pick were also discussed in variations of the trade talks centered around Kuzma and Hield."
Now do Kyle kuzma and Kevin knox
"That's number 6 all time Laker 3p made legend, Kyle Kuzma. Dude has a major top ten stat on one of the greatest franchizes of all time in four years... (damn the game is different now lol)"
"&gt; I don't see any team trading an all star-caliber PG for any combo of those pieces.   They might if that PG is either an unrestricted free agent who might tell his team to trade him to the Lakers or he'll just walk and leave his team with nothing (i.e. possibly Kyle Lowry or *maybe* Chris Paul), or if that PG is incredibly overpaid to where his team might just want to get off his contract (i.e. Kemba Walker or Russell Westbrook). It's not like they could use these pieces for Steph or Dame though, obviously.   &gt; the Lakers don't have many picks to trade.   They have the 22nd pick in this year's draft and their 2027 1st round pick, along with a bunch of 2nds.  &gt; Kuz has seemingly been on the trade market for years now and no trades have materialized.   That's not really accurate, or rather doesn't reflect the truth there. Up until free agency starts and Kuzma's extension kicks in, he'll have been on his rookie contract this whole time, meaning before this season he was on a deal that paid him less than $2 million per year. Just because of the need to match salaries, it's impossible to trade a guy making that little and get anything valuable in return, and at that price the Lakers wanted to keep him and see how he developed. It's tough to get good rotation players for less than the minimum like that.   Once Kuzma signed that extension last off-season it made trading him this year basically impossible because of [the poison pill provision,](https://twitter.com/BobbyMarks42/status/1340781915226435588?s=19) and because the Lakers were hard capped. This upcoming free agency is really the first time in Kuzma's entire career where it will have made any sense for the Lakers to trade him. That's why nothing has ever materialized. People on here have talked about him getting traded for years, but it has never been realistic before now.   &gt; Lakers aren't really in any position of leverage with the assets they have.   This is wrong for one reason, and it applies to all three players: Bird rights. It's the same reason why Lowry is probably going to be signed and traded rather than just signing as a free agent: because the good teams who might want him are capped out, so he'll need to involve the team that has his Bird rights to get to where he wants to go.   Maybe if Schroder and Caruso get monster offers in free agency from teams they want to play for then they'll leave (as would Kyle Lowry if that happened), but it's highly unlikely that happens. Some shitty team with a lot of cap space isn't going to want to blow it on those guys. The only teams who might want to give them big deals are contenders looking for more depth, but those teams are capped out, and thus would need the Lakers involvement.   THT is a different case because he's [a restricted free agent that is Arenas limited,](https://youtu.be/YdCOrUGdgg8) meaning teams can't offer him more than the MLE, and the Lakers are able to match any offer he gets. So if some team desperately wants him, they probably will need the Lakers involvement as well.   So the Lakers don't have *total* leverage over those guys, but it's wrong to say they ""aren't really in any position of leverage."""
"Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivaca Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, Alex Caruso 🔥"
Yes with him as the primary ball handler and 1st scoring option   Replace DeMar DeRozan with Kyle Kuzma for his entire career and the teams he’s on don’t make the playoffs my guy   Kuzma is at best an okay 7th man
Kyle Kuzma
Would you rather have Kyle Kuzma or DeMar DeRozan? That’s who he’s replacing if he goes to LA

"I honestly wouldn't worry too much about the 30m ask. 3 years is relatively short plus expirings always have value so it's really just year 2 (fwiw I don't think there'd be a severe decline in play in year 2, his game is way more IQ based than anything else) and injuries that are the worries.  Beyond that, when you look at the going rate for contracts, it's pretty worth it when you consider a Kyle Kuzma getting 13m or Norman Powell/Gary Trent looking for the 18-25 range.  With Lowry you get a ton of desirable skills in a player (shooting, defending, playmaking) as well as a guy who's shown he can carry any random collection of bench guys to great advanced stats and a vocal leader on offense and defense who brings a ton of intangibles."
"Who says no  Ben Simmons PG, Kyle Kuzma PG, Yao Ming SG, Kristaps Porzingis SF,  SGA PF, Muggsy Bogues C"
That’s *Champion* and Summer league MVP Kyle Kuzma to you
Kyle Kuzma
Off topic but how are the top lottery picks looking in summer league? Now of course summer league is no indication of how their careers will turn out see Kyle Kuzma for example but still your thoughts please.
"“Did LA give up too much to get a guy who has been called a stat padder, even though he averages a triple double, which only one other player has done?”  “Is that a trick question? They gave up KYLE KUZMA, who cares?!”"
No reason?  https://thespun.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/kyle-kuzma-is-getting-crushed-for-his-tweet-about-klay-thompson

Idk why i read ben simmons here somewhere but then again kyle kuzma is ben simmons
He looks at Kyle Kuzma with his model girlfriend and thinks “why can’t that be me?”
"Blake was doing stand-up comedy and acting. He was definitely on that tip. He was no Jordan Clarkson or Kyle Kuzma, but he was out there."
No almost the entire league lost an inch or so. Some players got their heights re edited to their shoes on height tho like Kyle Kuzma and Markieff Morris
Kuzma Kyle
Kyle Kuzma
"Lmao. You are acting like “Laker fans” on Reddit aren’t a bunch of twelve year olds with too much times. “Laker fans” also claimed Kyle Kuzma was a star player, Talen Tucker is the next Lebron and the list goes on. Their opinions mean very little and certainly don’t represent any kind of consensus."
"My top five  1. Gary Trent Jr   2. Kevin Porter Jr.  3. Lonzo Ball  4. Kelson Johnson  5. Kyle Kuzma  I feel like most of the people mentioned are   - Stars (Zion, Shai, Sabonis, Ja), and would need a 1st team All-NBA or an MVP to win  - Second Year (LaMelo, Edwards, Haliburton), and would all need to be legitimate stars to win it since there is a bias   - Guys that will probably be mostly as good if not a little better (FVV, Ben, Fox)"

Kyle Kuzma and Swaggy P.  And now Westbrook.
"Thank God Kyle Kuzma with his unmatched sportmanship decided to let Westbrook wear his number, even though it was retired."
Kyle Kuzma all over again
"Bench- Alex Caruso, kyle Kuzma, THT,"
"Ben ""Kyle Kuzma"" Simmons"
Would you know about Kyle Kuzma if he wasn’t on the lakers? I’m not sure he’d be as popular as he is.   I bet what monk is Betting on:  -Bigger role (lakers don’t have the money to sign someone better) -Playoff experience where he shines  -Lots and lots of exposure   Bet he believes if he does his next contract is gonna look really good. Like maybe with a good team his defensive stats look good and he knows he can hit that corner 3
pretty much everyone gets more spotlight on the lakers. it’s an unwritten rule. most people wouldn’t be speaking about kyle kuzma if he was drafted elsewhere.
"That’s a good argument for why an owner should go into the tax to get Kyrie, Harden and KD, and not such a good argument for why an owner should go way deeper in the tax for Kyle Kuzma.   If you want to take this down the business route, it’s about ROI. How much closer does Kuzma get the Nets to a ring? Do you really think it’s close enough that throwing an extra $100M on a guy (or two) like him is THAT likely to bring the team a championship?"
"“Oh damn he’s willing to spend $157 million to buy an asset he expects will significantly appreciate, why won’t he dump another $100M on acquiring … Kyle Kuzma”"
"Kyle Kuzma - he gets clowned on a lot, but I think outside of the LA media circus he could really shine as a number 2 option in Washington.  Idk about the second half of the question, nobody really jumps out at me."
I'm high on kyle kuzma because he plays for the wizards.  I'm low on every other teams player because they don't play for the wizards
"The Lakers have Westbrook and a plethora of guards that fit an offense around LeBron and AD. Why the hell do they need Schroder?  Consider the guards they have now: Westbrook, Monk, Nunn, Ellington, THT, Bazemore  Just in terms of fit, he's not getting minutes over the first 4 guards. He can't shoot. He can't create for others. He's not particular young. He can't guard multiple positions.   He's really only good at one thing and that's the occasional straight-forward drive to take a contested layup. Extremely one-dimensional offensive player who just puts some extra effort on defense to make it look likes doing alot. He's basically the Kyle Kuzma of point guards."
Lmao have you read any thread about Kyle Kuzma in the last 36 months?
"Every championship team in the last 15 years.  Heck even the rockets only beat clippers because josh smith and corey brewer decided to go on a tear.  You want me to list?  1. 2011 mavs have the jet and barrea go on shooting tears through out the play offs  2. 2012 mario mother fucking chalmers and shane battier have amazing games   3. 2013 ray allen mario chalmers and the big 3  4. 2014 boris diaw was a major contributor and marco and the big 3  5. 2015 warriors had a team based offense where 1-5 could all share the ball and score. 3rd option was barnes, draymond was actually decent on offense too.   6. 2016 jr smith, rj can both create and score and you had a big 3  7. 2017 warrior had 4 all stars so thats just cheap  8. 2018 same as last one  9. 2019 fred vandewhatever, kyle lowery and danny green pascal can all contribute heavily on offense  10.  2020 kcp and rondo stepped up. Kuzma can also create for himself.   11. 2021 holiday didnt do great on offense but he was still a threat. Lopez can creat for himself. Bobby stepped up   So yeah literally every team that won the last 11 years had a 3rd and 4th option that was an offensive threat."
-Kyle Kuzma
"Did… did you just compare 21 year old Brandon Ingram to 26 year old Kyle Kuzma? Beyond that, Kuzma has no reason for Lebron to have held him back. He’s an off ball player. He should have thrived next to Lebron if he were a good player."
It's the Kyle Kuzma redemption arc
&gt;Kyle Kuzma - Averaged almost 20 PPG in only his second season.  &gt;KCP - High quality 3&amp;D rotation player and starter.  &gt;Montrez Harrell - Former 6th man in the league just a season ago.  How the narratives change
"And the Wizards get to keep Kyle Kuzma, not bad"
So no Kyle kuzma?!
that's not kyle kuzma
"Anyone can win if they're on the right team. Hell, Alex Caruso and Kyle Kuzma are NBA champions because they were on the right team."
A la Schroder and Drummond. Possibly Kyle Kuzma as well
"No way of answering this until we see the Thompson trade actually go through.  Right now we're getting Bruno and Dunn back in the deal but then the deal got held up and there were rumours more was at play (with Dunn and Bruno maybe not coming to Boston).  **IF** that's true then:  1. We could be getting a player back via a multi-team trade. We could use Thompson going to Atlanta as a salary matcher to bring a player in from a  3rd team.   *eg. Kuzma is currently with Washington but they have Deni and Rui and when they tried to offload him to Brooklyn, the Nets said no. We could maybe get him cheap. We've also been interested in Kyle Anderson from Memphis for a while.*  2. We could be offloading Thompson to clear up more of our MLE. We can only use ~7m of our TPE right now but if we're able to trade Thompson without taking Dunn/Bruno back we'd have a little more breathing room that would allow us to maybe sign a remaining FA.   *eg. We're apparently one of the teams interested in signing Danny Green. We'd probably need the full MLE to make a competitive offer though.*   But then again maybe nothing happens and the Thompson/Dunn/Bruno trade goes through unchanged and we can only sign a vet min."
"Every point you make comes back to age alone. Dude - you called Kyle Kuzma garbage.  Young, old, middle aged ... garbage is garbage.  If Kuzma is garbage then THT is garbage at a younger age.  In reality neither is garbage but both are overpaid.  I realize the age slant and have no idea why you keep bringing it up.  Being young alone does not justify getting paid 10 mill/yr."
I think we just disagree about THT's play tbh.  We don't disagree he's young.  But if you're going to say Kyle Kuzma is garbage I don't understand how you could think THT is better than garbage.
"Yeah, a nightly trouble double makes your team worse. Especially when the guys before him were Kyle Kuzma and Dennis Schroder."
"To be *the worst* you actually have to impact something. Like, Poku was terrible last year. Who cares? His negativity didn't have any actual negative impact. But Kyle Kuzma was shitty on the Lakers, and Kelly Oubre sucked ass on the Warriors, and that actively hurt their teams' goals."
"Lebron personally walked into the Lakers front office and traded Kyle Kuzma, and for that reason he can never be GOAT."
and we had to give up summer league championship game MVP kyle kuzma for westbrook
"Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Kyle Kuzma, and now Alex Caruso all we’re done terribly by the Lakers who dumped them the first chance they got to get a star. They probably did Caruso the worst.   Good job ignoring 5 of the 6 players you fucked over though."
Kyle Fucking Kuzma
"Schröder is a good starter and wants 20-25m a year. Thats a a player friendly contract but for sure not an overpay if the fit is right. If it wasn't for Lakers fans/media building the narrative around him nobody would make these pointless claims and drag him through the mud.   He must be the only roleplayer that had a bad (or horrible) game when he has to be the #1 guy. What do we expect from a good starter? You can't tell a guy:  ""Oh btw AD is out LBJ is playing injured and without that much motivation and besides those guys your only help is Andre Drummond and Kyle Kuzma. Now go out there and drop a nice 25 and 6 while having to create almost everything completly on your own against one of the leagues best defenses""  If that is your expectation for a solid starter than you're just delusional. Starters don't do shit like that Allstars do."
"Especially when you consider they turned a completely washed up Wall and a protected 2023 pick into Westbrook which will become Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell, and the 22nd overall pick of the 2021 Draft."
"you won the title with:  * Kentavius Caldwell-Pope  * Good Rajon Rondo  * Danny Green  * Kyle Kuzma  * Alex Caruso  Instead of those guys, you now have a 33-year-old point guard who relies on his athleticism and can't shoot, defend, or play off ball."
"Tristan Thompson, Iman Shumpert, Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schoeder, and a Nets first round pick."
All of a sudden Kyle Kuzma isn’t that bad
What about Kyle Kuzma? He’s a top player in this league and has a twin brother Karl
Cuz no one would believe them. “Kyle Kuzma wants to play in Orlando” cmon
"Timberwolves fans, Kyle Kuzma is the savior of your franchise you have been waiting for!"
And you all said we wouldn’t hear Kyle kuzma news again
“I’m back” - Kyle Kuzma
2021-22: Kyle Kuzma
Description of the suspect is Kyle Kuzma with a cartoon mustache
The suspects name….Kyle Kuzma
Remember when Kyle Kuzma won the summer league MVP?

more casual fans know who kyle kuzma is than pj tucker or joe harris.  thats why
"I promise laker fans talk about the Clippers more than the Clipper fans lol.   You just named off Morris, Beverley, Kennard, Ibaka and Rondo…..you really think one of those players can’t be traded to clear cap room to sign someone like Demar?  For a team that just went to the western conference finals, their assets are more valuable than Kyle Kuzma and Montrash Harrell, thats for damn sure"
"That 2017 draft doesn't just count as one mistake, it was a tremendous failure on multiple fronts. We had 3 first round picks and could've walked away with: John Collins (@ #15), Jarrett Allen/OG Anunoby (@ #20), and Kyle Kuzma/Derrick White/Josh Hart/Dillon Brooks (@ #26).  Or if we still made our trade of #15 + #20 for #10, we could have taken Bam Adebayo or Donovan Mitchell there.  Instead of getting any ONE of those players above, we walked away with Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan. And even if Zach Collins were healthy, he looks like a serviceable rotation player, not a star, and certainly not someone who would've pushed us to the next level. That draft was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster."
I'm not sure if you can really say Kyle Kuzma was someone he should've hit on. Most don't really consider Kuzma a good player in any right.
Durant and Harden gonna frown when they meet former Laker Kyle Kuzma next week😂
Honestly I'm just happy I won't have Lakers fans talk about Kyle kuzma anymore
NO is also responsible for drafting Meyers Leonard at 11 in 2012. And Caleb Swanigan ahead of Kyle Kuzma and Dylan Brooks in 2017. Talent evaluation—particularly as it relates to bigs—has been highly suspect for the last decade or so.
Kyle “Big Market” Kuzma
"Look at the Lakers non-lottery picks here. THT, Kuz, Hart, Nance, etc. Only 2 out and out bad picks.  46	LAL	Talen Horton-Tucker 25	LAL	Moritz Wagner 39	LAL	Isaac Bonga 47	LAL	Svi Mykhailiuk 27	LAL	Kyle Kuzma 30	LAL	Josh Hart 42	LAL	Thomas Bryant 32	LAL	Ivica Zubac 27	LAL	Larry Nance Jr. 34	LAL	Anthony Brown 46	LAL	Jordan Clarkson"
Because I think even the Kings know they can probably do better than one Kyle Kuzma.
"James Worthy, Byron Scott, Kyle Kuzma"
Kyle kuzma was available
Lmao  I hope this happens just so that Kyle Kuzma has to decide if he should delete his “Beal what’s the deal #capitalboyz” post
"Kyle Kuzma on setting the Lakers record for most threes bricked: ""This guy next to me will be the next one."" The guy next to him is Dennis Shroder."
He’s a star alright. When the league ships his ass to Guangdong   你好！你好！ 你好！我叫 KYLE KUZMA！我喜欢热狗，汉堡包 和牛奶。
"I love Kuzma. The hype behind him from the start was way too high, which isn’t a knock on him. Laker fans have a way of thinking every player that shows a glimmer of greatness in even one game is going to breakout to be the next Kobe or the next mvp. We do it with expecting every player to want to come play for us because we’re the Lakers, I’m guilty of it too. But it’s unfair to guys like him, puts expectations too high and puts too much pressure, but he didn’t shy away from the spotlight. I’m proud of what he’s contributed and will always have love for that whole young Laker group. Like it or not, Kyle Kuzma, Nba champion."
"Kinda depressing for Kings fans. Even if it’s the right move, to think you’re giving away the centerpiece to the Boogie trade and the 2nd pick in the most stacked draft since 2003 for Kyle Kuzma is a hard pill to swallow."
"report/s suggest that the Wizards pivoted because of Westbrook being involved  Eric Pincus:  &gt; Over the past few weeks, the Lakers pursued Westbrook and Hield in parallel conversations with the Wizards and Sacramento Kings. As the draft neared, the Wizards seemed content to wait on big decisions with Beal and Westbrook.  &gt; That pushed Hield to the forefront. But even as the possibility of a deal built around Kyle Kuzma and Harrell began to form, the Lakers kept the door open to a Westbrook deal.  &gt; Westbrook asserted his voice into the conversation, and per an NBA source, the Wizards pivoted. Just like that, the pieces the Kings liked for Hield were no longer available.

Kyle Kuzma is gonna get better now like Ingram and ball
"yep. a lot was asked from him, and he put up with it day in and day out, doing what he could to help the team. his expectations were always unrealistic to say the least, but he took it well and tried to fulfill that role to the best of his ability. the man gets so much hate, but as an outside looking in, i have nothing but respect for Kyle Kuzma"

He’s acting like Kyle kuzma is a HOFer lol
I feel like all those picks are more credit to player development than good picks.  Forbes/Kawhi/Murray/Dejoune/Keldon all didn't have spectacular rookie years   Like Kyle Kuzma who was drafted around the same time as Derrick White had much better NBA start to his career but now Derrick White seems to be better.
Logic? It’s literally an indisputable fact that Kyle Kuzma has won more titles than the LA Clippers…
Future Orlando Magic star Kyle Kuzma
"Man I wanted the Buddy deal to go through so badly. I’m fine with the Davion pick, I just hope we can do something with Buddy real quick here. It’s to the point where I was legit excited to get Kyle Kuzma and am now bummed we won’t be getting Kyle Kuzma. Down BAD."
How did u put Herro on that list? He is Kyle Kuzma level after this year
We’ll take Davion for Kyle “Better Than Tatum” Kuzma.  Who says no?  Please..we’ll even throw in Harrell.
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
"I honestly can’t believe the disrespect Westbrook gets at this point . Not everyone with high usage can produce at a league leading level. That’s like saying Bradley Beal isn’t a good scorer, he was just 2nd in the league in scoring only because he had high usage, and If Kyle Kuzma were given the same amount of usage as Bradley Beal, he’d be second in the league in scoring too. That’s simply just not true."
Kyle Kuzma flair
I love when Lebron said that and refused to help Kyle Kuzma up at multiple points during the 3 seasons they played together lmao
That was Kyle Kuzma
Imagine trying to trade Kyle Kuzma for Devin Booker.  Game 6 2021 First Round. Booker scored 47 pts. Kuzma wasnt too far behind with 2 pts
I’m so sure he was encouraging Kyle Kuzma these last two post-seasons lmao
1. Romeo Langford will be an above average bench player this season.  2. Kyle Kuzma will be a consistent 15-20 ppg scorer with the Wizards.
What are the chances Kyle Kuzma has a break out year?
Which star is going for LeVert and Allen? Oh.  Which star is going for Bledsoe and RJ Hampton? Oh.  Which star is going for Ty Jerome and Kelly Oubre? Oh.  Which star is going for Montrezl Harrell and Kyle Kuzma? Oh.  Only in the last 12 months.
"""The Lakers should trade Kyle Kuzma for Devin Booker"""
"Every star flops. Yes, Lebron flops. Lebron cries to the refs and doesn't get back on defense because he thinks it's better than hoping Kyle Kuzma hits an open 3"
“Kyle Kuzma and Ben Simmons are gonna be on the Shanghai Sharks next year 🤣🤣🤣”
wdym? Kyle kuzma Anthony Davis kcp Wesley Matthews and caruso were the clear Big 5
I would say he's not even top 10 he's close though  No particular order   Paul George  Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant  Lebron  Russ  Pat Bev  Ben Simmons  James Harden  Kyrie(maybe? not 100% on this one)  Draymond  Chris Paul      Honorable Mentions    Kelly Olynyk  Rudy Gobert  Grayson Allen  Devin Booker  Kyle Kuzma
kyle kuzma zero points
Imagine thinking you couldn’t win without KCP and Kyle Kuzma smh
Kyle Kuzma of the 90s was Rick Fox.

Conspiracy Theory: Kuzma planted those people with signs so he could get spicy after the game. What Cleveland fan gives a second thought to Kyle Kuzma
"As much as I liked Kyle Kuzma, it was best for his career that he leave LAL. He’ll be a star someday, but it wasn’t going to happen in Los Angeles."
King Kyle Kuzma
"Kyle ""Klutch"" Kuzma. Oh wait..."
Caruso was the only Laker I liked other than Javale. He just makes winning plays. I'm glad he's still appreciated now that he's not on LA. Lot of hyped role players who leave a popular team are often forgotten about. Just look at Kyle Kuzma who is playing quite nicely for the Wizards
That’s NBA champion Kyle Kuzma to you
"You hear that Cleveland, that’s **Washington Wizards legend** Kyle Kuzma speaking."
Never thought I'd fall in love with Kyle Kuzma but here we are
**NO!** ***NOT THIS GUY! FUCKING KYLE KUZMA MAN***
Is Kyle Kuzma DeShawn Stevenson this time?
"“Kispert, I swear to GOD” - Kyle Kuzma"
COLD BLOODER KILLER KYLE KUZMA
WIZARDS LEGEND KYLE KUZMA
I hate Kyle Kuzma
 who is Kyle Kuzma?  in math: my solution ➗  in history: my king 👑   in art: my muse 🎨  in science: my oxygen 💨  in geography: my world 🌎
KYLE KUZMA THE LEGEND LETS GOOOOOOOO
"LMAO What does re-signing him have to do with your original point about development? Keep shifting the goal posts I guess.  Also, Kyle Kuzma, and to a lesser extent Randle, BI, and Svi all spent time developing within the farm and on the big team."
"Yup you’re absolutely right, however it is intriguing how many great prospects the Lakers have drafted in the last decade that went on to play decent minutes for other teams (obviously in order to trade for players like AD):  Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, Dangelo Russell, Larry Nance, Ivica Zubac, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Thomas Bryant, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Alex Caruso, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk"
They won a championship counting all season on Kyle Kuzma to be their third option. It’s definitely possible.
I don't see why you feel the need to dispute this. Kyle Kuzma saidnl it was a done deal until the Lakers switched to wanting Westbrook. An actual player being a source is the closest you're going to get. You don't have to try to make it an argument.
"Yes trade him to the Wizards for Kyle Kuzma, KCP, and Montrezl Harrell"
"They didn’t have to choose between the two, that was just because they were being cheap. I woulda called the bluff of the rumors saying THT would walk and first offer Caruso a deal before giving THT a cheaper one. He’s not horrible, but Tucker has barely done anything on the team and makes almost as much as Kyle Kuzma. That’s ridiculous."
"why is that bad?  &amp;#x200B;  why bend the rules to give the inferior player an advantage  &amp;#x200B;  kyle kuzma shouldn't be able to defend kevin durant, and if the rules ever allow him to shut him down there's a problem"
"Using this list and your assists #s above, here's assists per game (from most):  * Anthony Davis:	2.05  * Kevin Love:	1.59  * Chris Bosh:	1.35  * Kyle Kuzma:	1.35  * Zydrunas Ilgauskas:	1.22  * Dwyane Wade:	1.15  * Drew Gooden:	1.15  * Mo Williams:	1.04  * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope:	0.90  * J.R. Smith:	0.89  * Kyrie Irving:	0.84  * Anderson Varejao:	0.71  * Mario Chalmers:	0.64  * Daniel Gibson: 0.62  * Tristan Thompson: 0.55  * Eric Snow: 0.45  * Sasha Pavlovic: 0.38"
"Because, as I've been saying for years, Kyle Kuzma is not a good NBA player."

I also recall Laker fans hyping up Kyle Kuzma as a better pick than Jayson Tatum in their rookie seasons lmao
"it's the same problem though. when an offensive player ""exploited rules,"" people would go in a frenzy and call it cheap. but when a defensive player ""exploits the rules"" and hacks/tries to draw bullshit charges/etc the response is always ""HAHA PLAY BETTER"" to the offensive guy. it's weird.  &amp;#x200B;  I read a post complaining that Kyle Kuzma wasn't able to defend James Harden without fouling and my thought was like.. why should he be able to? he's a way worse player. if the rules make it so that he can shut down a james harden, there's a problem with the rules. we've been seeing guys who were literally unplayable in the playoffs look like all nba defenders because they're able to hack at superstars and disrupt their shots freely.   I don't know why the assumption that physicality leads to better basketball exists. when basketball was at its most physical, it was ugly as fuck. I don't wanna go back to that lol"

Yes he is the reverse Kyle Kuzma
"&gt; They drafted Lydon who i wouldn't have drafted with the 60th pick. How come these proffesional front office geniuses with much better scouting and information than me fucked that up?  Dunno what to tell you there. Teams will reach for a gamble with their late 1st. Nothing is guaranteed at that point whatsoever. You can confirm this with how many players drafted after him are out of the league, it is almost all of them. They had some sort of intel that told them that maybe this was a little bit better of a gamble than others. Of the ones who are still in the league now only Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White, and Dillon Brooks are starters. Not exactly guys anyone thought to pick either.  Luckily Denver also found Monte Morris late in that draft who is now the best back up PG in the league.  &gt; Giving Jamal the contract a year early your risk is fairly high while the reward is at least comparable as giving him the contract a year later . Giving him the contract a year later your risk is clearly much lower while the reward is roughly the same if not bigger. Surely you agree with this.  No, I don't agree with this because I've followed the NBA long enough and have seen enough lousy rookie/RFA/UFA situations to know that if you think your player will be worth that, then give it to them. Countless times they wait a year and it sours the player, it says to other players we are going to make you wait to get contract security as long as we possibly can, we want to wait for you not to get injured another year before we commit to you, and when they go to RFA they get to hear from other teams how much that team values them, how the team they're on didn't give them the max but that they would have, that they're going to do everything that their other team can't do if their team doesn't match the max. Whether or not they end up staying with the team, that has a huge impact on someone in their early 20s.   Again, this isn't 2K, the human element in this is a huge deal. That's why all these teams secure their guy a year early. It's not like the ""logic"" and math isn't obvious. It's that it's clearly outweighed by the negatives, considering if the player plays the exact same as they did the last year you're gonna give it to them anyway."
Players do this all the time. Kyle Kuzma did something like this last season. And Dennis took out Lakers PG In his bio at one point last season.
Kyle Kuzma Third team all-NBA
Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma purchased a human with his first paycheck???
"The value of money isn't linear. $100 is $100 whether you make $50k or $5 billion, but for two people making $10 million and $1 billion, $100 is effectively the same.  Think about Kyle Kuzma making $15 million. Yes mathematically you're closer in wealth to him than he is to Steve Ballmer. But he lives a life far closer to Ballmer than you."
"&gt; Jamal when he was maxed was very inconsistent and was averaging 18/4/5 on 54 ts% with bad defense. That type of player is not worth a max. This is a fact proven by the existence of players of similar caliber none of which are getting paid the max. The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  You mean a 20 year old was inconsistent? Shocking. A 20 year old averaging 18/4/5 with bursts of amazing play is exactly who gets the RFA max contract. I think you're thinking of supermax contracts which come after something like that.   Why? Because a team sees clear evidence in growth in the player as they've been in their system for years. They see a higher ceiling and as they mature and gain more experience (like every player in league history) they will become more consistent.   Otherwise they get the rookie extension which is for players like Grayson Allen, Larry Nance Jr., Kyle Kuzma, Luke Kennard, Markelle Fultz, etc. or the let Jamal Walk into RFA and feel disrespected or not believed in by the team, another team with the space gives him the max and then Denver matches it but with 1 less year on the contract.  &gt; The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  Well...yeah. Of course. He had the same first 3 years as Devin Booker but just had less shots because Jokic was there. Same as Donovan Mitchell. All of these players are getting this contract based on their potential to grow and the teams belief that they will reach that potential. No player is an actualized or realized player at 21 or 22 years old.   When Jokic was averaging 18/11/6 did they sign him thinking that was going to be his peak? Of course not. When Mitchell was averaging 24/4/4 and shooting terribly from 3 and playing 0 defense did the Jazz sign him to the rookie max thinking that was the player they were going to get forever? No.  &gt; Reaching his potential or even improving at all was in no way a given.  A generic statement that can be applied to any player ever. Embiid being able to play 1/2 of a season when he got his extension wasn't a given. Trae Young finding a way to not be the worst defender at his position in the league and shoot better than 43 from the floor or 34 from 3 isn't a given--but he got his max. Fox turning out to not just be a stat accumilator on a terrible team when he was given his max isn't a given. KAT not being a black hole on offense and a terrible defensive player when he was given his max wasn't a given.   &gt; There were some things that were encouraging and would leave you to believe he's gonna improve, there were also huge red flags that would lead you to believe the opposite.  I don't know what red flags you're talking about. Year 1 to year 2 Jamal had a massive jump. Year 2 to year 3 Jamal's defense and playmaking took a huge steo up. Year 3 to year 4 Jamal took another step up in all areas and then obviously we saw the bubble. Then sure enough year 4 to year 5 was another giant step up.  There were no greater red flags with Jamal Murray than there are with any player at that age, and far more positives considering the nearly linear growth (and growth is never truly linear) compared to his peers.   &gt;  Waiting a year for him to hit RFA would've cost them nothing and alleviated a lot of the risk.  This isn't 2K. There is a human element to showing belief and trust in your player, especially for this Nuggets team and management, especially for all small market teams. You don't just get to let someone go to RFA and pretend like that doesn't stick with them, upset them, be in the back of their mind when they come up for free agency down the road. That's life. It has happened time and time again. If you think your player is worth matching a max in RFA then you max him on your own, otherwise you just bothered a cornerstone player of your franchise and also signed him to 1 less year than you could have.  &gt; Just because he turned out to be worth the max doesn't make maxing him a smart decision.   I guess it's a good thing that our front office of professionals designed to scout, draft, evaluate, train, and put players in positions to succeed before assessing the risk of 9-figure paydays knows better than you what is and isn't a 'smart decision'. It was a bad take then and I'm sure people let you hear it at that point just as they are now. It was a smart decision as a team, as a franchise, as a culture building organization, and as a small market team. No brainer.  &gt; This wasn't/isn't a reactionary take, all of you are just braindead.  Yes. It is everyone else who is wrong. Certainly not worth stepping back and reassessing your thoughts on a situation when everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong. It is the children who are out of touch!"

"&gt;While the defensive metric you gave is better DEFRTG, it isn’t exactly perfect. When compare Curry’s and Doncic’s DARPM to other average defenders and even below average defenders, the stat isn’t very consistent. For example, Kyle Kuzma has a DARPM of 1.28, which is good enough for 22nd best in the league, while better defenders like KCP only has a DARPM of 0.95 (47th). When adjusted to LA-DARPM, guys like Royce O’neal is no. 168 while Steph is no. 98 (and Russ apparently has the 50th best DARPM). The fact is that there isn’t an accurate statistic or metric that can correctly judge a player’s effectiveness on defense. And the point still stands that both Steph and Luka are both below average defenders, yet Steph is widely agreed to be a Top 5 or even Top 3 player while OP was using Luka being below average to be a reason he isn’t.  You can't just look at a stat, expect it to agree with you on everything and when it doesn't, say it's wrong. DRAPM is not perfect but it's the best that's out there. You didn't want my eye test, you didn't get it, but to me, Curry is around a net neutral on defense whereas Luka's lack of effort puts him at a clear negative.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There are so many players who found success with sky high USG%. Lebron is no. 1 in USG% among players in Top 10 career playoff games with 32.1%, and it resulted with him winning 4 championships, 4 Finals MvPs and 10 Finals appearances with only 3 missed Playoffs. And then this is what I like the most: Michael Jordan, who is no. 19 in Nba Career Playoffs Games, has an astronomically high USG% of 35.5, near identical to Luka’s USG% in the 2020-21 season, which you called high. And what did it result in? 6 championships, 2 Threepeats, 6 Finals MvPs. Hell, he even had 2 championship runs in 1992 and 1993 that had him put up a USG% of 37.1 and 38.0 respectively, both higher than what you consider high for Luka.     Lebron literally might be the ONLY truly ball dominant player to find postseason success. Ben Taylor talked about this in his podcast, talking about portability and playoff success in guys like James Harden. He mentioned the bad history of ball dominant guys, and said ""Lebron is the exception."" Luka isn't Lebron.  For MJ, you're relying on a pretty terrible Usage stat. He isn't the ""Ball Dominant"" like Luka and Lebron and Harden are. Luka had a top 3 offensive load of all time going by Ben Taylors Offensive Load metric. The way to measure ball dominance is through play by play data and ""Time On Ball"" stats. MJ was a far better offball player than Luka was, and he was nowhere near as ball dominant. Usage% is not a good stat."

There is a world in which Kyle Kuzma is an injury replacement level All-Star
Kyle “Rudy Gobert” Kuzma
@[Kyle Kuzma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTP-LKZeJ20)
"Kyle ""do a 360"" Kuzma"
"Did they? All anyone talked about all year was how terrible javale/dwight/rondo/kuz were. And to be honest they were bad most of the time. Green/Kcp/Caruso were solid, but the rest of the team was not optimally built and had gaping holes especially at the wing position.   It seems you’re trying to rewrite history because they ended up winning. The 2020 lakers actually weren’t built that well. While they had some okay pieces there’s a reason most of those guys bounced around teams the next year. Dwight wasn’t good for Philly, rondo went to two different teams and javale didn’t do shit. And Kyle kuzma is a fucking bum who took 12 shots a game to score 12 point. He has zero ball handling, shot creation, playmaking ability and is average at best on defense. Kcp is a streaky player with confidence issues. Green was injured for the lakers run and played terrible and they still won in spite of that"
"If you're giving Kyle Kuzma very high usage in the playoffs, you're losing in the playoffs."
"People are literally acting like Kyle Kuzma is god now he’s on the Wizards. I hope all these former Lakers do well, especially the championship ones, but it’s hilarious how shit flip flops."
Year one he didn’t play w/ another “Superstar”  Lonzo Ball  Michael Beasley  Isaac Bonga  Reggie Bullock  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Alex Caruso  Tyson Chandler  Josh Hart  Andre Ingram  Brandon Ingram  Jemerrio Jones  Kyle Kuzma  Scott Machado  JaVale McGee  Mike Muscala  Svi Mykhailiuk  Rajon Rondo  Lance Stephenson  Moritz Wagner  Johnathan Williams  Ivica Zubac

Kyle Kuzma turning face is good for the league too.
"Kyle Kuzma, man of the people"
Veteran Kyle Kuzma
"I can’t believe the Wizards got Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma and the draft rights to Isaiah Jackson for nothing"
"Oh so it’s really fuck Kyle Kuzma night, let’s get it"
Remember when Stephen A said the Lakers should trade Kyle Kuzma for Devin Booker? Good times
I fucking hate Kyle Kuzma man
"2 guys on the super max + kyle kuzma 12 mil, montrez (player option), KCP on 12 mil &amp; still paying freakin luol deng. This is the Lakers next year unless players sign for the minimum."
Over/Under Kyle Kuzma gets a thousand death threats tonight
As a magic fan... Fuck kyle kuzma
Lol last season was the best of his career if you're able to analyze the game beyond PPG. Your team is going nowhere with Kyle Kuzma scoring 15 PPG. He's made huge strides as a defender and has become a good rebounder as well.

Kyle Kuzma is horrific.
Kyle Kuzma could be a star if he spent as much time in the gym as he does in front of the mirror trying on new outfits

"Kyle ""My paycheck still coming next week, right?"" Kuzma"
"Bro, this Laker’s team is fucking trash. Kyle Kuzma isn’t an NBA player, I won’t be convinced otherwise."
Kyle Kuzma in shambles
Kyle Kuzma of the Heat
kyle kuzma
&gt;Kyle Kuzma flair  Bro your IQ is the number of points Kuzma is averaging against the Suns.
Yeah low draft picks and THT are real good assets.  Or are you referring to Kyle Kuzma? I heard he could be traded for Tatum
&gt;Kyle Kuzma flair  That says it all  about your intelligence really 😂
"when he was 22 or something?   playing with rookie lonzo ball?  he's still only 25  everybodys always in a hurry to write players off, I want to see him on a different team before drawing any grand conclusions about who kyle kuzma is"
Kyle Kuzma for Devin Booker is a fair trade
The reason Kyle Kuzma is so ass is because of all that lead poisoning. How else could you explain his shot selection? No wonder he wanted to look like light-skin Eminem with that bleached haircut.
"We aren't elite athletes though, it must suck to be a Kyle Kuzma or something and seeing kids put him to shame.   However I'm sure they got no problem while getting paid literally millions."
I feel like the only correct answer is Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma  Victor Oladipo
CJ averaged 11 more point and 3 more assists than Kyle Kuzma this year on similar efficiency. He was getting all-star consideration before he was injured.
"If Harrell accepts his player option you will be about $9 million over the cap with Drummond, Schroder, and Caruso departing. I just don’t see how you contend with 2 stars and literally nothing else besides ~Kyle Kuzma~"
17-49 on 2pt FGs is embarrassing. Kyle Kuzma cannot be the Lakers' 2nd-best player if they want to have a chance at sending this to a game 7.
Dennis Schröder and Kyle Kuzma lol
Kyle Kuzma is a poor mans Lamar Odom
MPJ is if Kyle Kuzma put his money where his mouth is.
"Kuzma doing well in garbage time, hence the name Kyle Trashma... why can't he do this when it matters?"
"I don't blame you LeBron, Kyle Kuzma would be extremely hard for any player to carry."
Lebron trying hard and Kuzma can't even score a layup. Kyle Trashma is real.
I want to laugh so put your trade offers for Kyle Kuzma below
"The team is shooting like 30% from the field and a large portion of that is LeBron's fault. You don't expect Kyle fucking Kuzma to make a bucket, you expect the guy who wants a claim to the GOAT argument."
"If you fall down, stay down. Your brothers will come pick you up. Unless you're Kyle Kuzma. Or unless I feel like quitting in the second quarter."
"Nobody from the Lakers is stepping up to stop the bleeding , i am watching this game as a neutral but man the over reliance on Lebron is insane, shooters not hitting open looks, kyle kuzma idk when he is going to come good when they desperately need him, lets hope for a more even second half"
Someone explain to me why a team that is absolutely atrocious scoring wouldn’t at least try to play the 6MOTY last year and instead is giving those big minutes to Kyle Fuckin’ Kuzma?
Is it just me or does Kyle Kuzma look like he talks about himself in third person?
Kyle Kuzma is going to go lights out and for 50 in the second half! Lol
kyle kuzma dated kendall jenner right? i’d love to know what he and book think of each other
"No they aren't indicative of future performance, they are glimpses into a players potential. Sometimes players start to put it together, like a Jaylen Brown, sometimes they go the other way, like a Kyle Kuzma.  The point is it was easy to see early on Harden had potential. No one expected him to become a generational offensive talent however.  Similarly, it's easy to see Herro has potential. Imo he caps out at a Redick-esque sharpshooter, which, while isn't exactly something you build around, also isn't anything to sneeze at (unless you have allergies, in that case god bless you)  As a franchise you have to decide to either trade high or gamble on them reaching their potential. In this particular case it likely benefits Miami to include him in their future plans as I can't think of any specific reasonable trade target that would put them in a much better place."
"&gt;James Lonzo and Butler with Ingram and Zubac is ... not a LeBron team I don't think. Neither Lonzo nor Butler shoot  Ball shot 38% from 3 last year.  Ingram shot 39%.  &gt;You'd have to put Zo on the bench and play Butler at the 2, move Ingram up a position probably and then trade for a 3  James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac is just fine.  3 shooters, 3 drivers, 3 distributors, 4 at-least-good defenders.  No 2020 team even troubles them on their way to a ring, especially with the ridiculous bench they'd have had.  And they wouldn't be trading for a 3 in any circumstance, since they'd have De'andre Hunter and Kyle Kuzma coming off the bench.  Their only problem would be trying to find minutes for all the players they have."
Kyle kuzma lives the life I would wanna live if I was a nba player lol so ig him
Kyle Kuzma has also been known to use “you know” very often during his interviews. Could we have advanced stats for him too?
[Taking a note out of Kuzma's book with that one](https://fadeawayworld.net/nba-media/kyle-kuzma-after-game-1-loss-to-the-blazers-i-slept-good-last-night-its-just-basketball-at-the-end-of-the-day)
"Consistently playing shit in playoff games hoping that ""the averages of them playing well"" when they're intentionally being exploited is such a bad way of looking at players. How the fuck is a Grizzlies fan going to comment on Kyle Kuzma when all he does is look at stats"
"Nah, Kyle Kuzma."
"Dylan, dylan, dylan, dylan, and Kyle Kuzma"
kyle kuzma is a certified bum
Do Lillard a favor and trade him to the Lakers for Kyle Kuzma
Huh? Lebron and Kyle Kuzma were literally the only two players left from the 2018-19 Lakers after the whole team got flushed out for AD. What are you mumbling about with this other teams being barely assembled with no chemistry nonsense?
HE SAID HE THINKS KYLE KUZMA CANT WIN A GAME
I don't think Kyle Kuzma can win a game.
"I mean considering they're giving Kyle Kuzma legit play time, yes they are"
"Kyle Kuzma seemed to have been playing more poised sometime this season. He was playing similar to how Michael Porter Jr. was playing, cutting and catch and shoot. But that didn’t last very long."
My favorite non superstar Kyle Kuzma
"Kyle Kuzma will official be given the title of Jester, he will now have to perform and juggle for the crowd at half times for the crowds"
No doubt Kyle Kuzma will step up.  But in all seriousness Suns in 6.
Karl Kyle was with Malone Kuzma.
the disrespect for rising stars MVP kyle kuzma smh
People only remember KMidd for being a human game slider on the Celtics or just playing dogshit. He's a cycle between 6'9 Ellen Degeneres Kyle Kuzma and Michael Jordan in the playoffs
"They tanked and got Alex Caruso? Kyle Kuzma? Talen Horton Tucker? Jordan Clarkson?  Just trying to figure out how those 4 players in particular fit into your bs narrative.   It’s also funny how one comment says you can’t count top picks, if they bust or not, because it’s consensus, and you say you can’t count them because they “tanked”.   Your insecurity is showing."
"We’ve seen regular season Rondo, Danny Green try to dribble the ball, Avery Bradley initiate an offense, Javale McGee post ups, Kyle Kuzma, and Andre Drummond play 25 minutes a night. Russ’s turnovers are coming from him being too unselfish, so I’m not worried at all about the preseason."
&gt;Kyle Kuzma makes the All-Star team  Bruh
&gt; The Nuggets don’t make the playoffs  Why  &gt; Kyle Kuzma makes the All-Star team  YES PLS. ITS TIME MY 6'9 Ellen Degeneres gets some MFkin RESPEK
"I’ve always been low on Kyle Kuzma, got a lot of shit for it during his rookie year when he was putting up bigger numbers and there were people comparing his upside to Tatum, but it has played out the way I expected. Dude is a totally average NBA player with no star potential."
The Nuggets don’t make the playoffs   Chris Finch wins Coach of the Year  Snyder gets fired after Utah underachieves in the playoffs again  Kyle Kuzma makes the All-Star team  Paul George wins MVP
"I’m still a little salty about that, I had legit talked myself into genuinely wanting Kyle Kuzma on my team"
Surprised Kyle kuzma didn’t make top 20. It’s embarrassing this list even got published
"Kyle Kuzma. 66 on the lakers. Remember, he’s currently never missed a FG against the lakers in his career."
Nobody wants Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma would not the best player in the room even if he was alone
Westbrook washed up unfortunately. Wizards won the trade kyle kuzma better
"Went to Lakers @ Bulls in 2019 and these dudes are fucking huge. I never realized how fucking big even somebody like Kyle Kuzma was until I saw in person. Even Caruso was a giant. Dwight, LeBron, AD and McGee are all monsters"
brick simmons kyle kuzma lookin scary
"The problem with all the players you listed is that they have glaring flaws.  Tyreke was cool, but he never learned how to shoot. Same with MCW. OJ Mayo was a pure scorer except he's not among the best at it like a Kyle Kuzma.   The NBA has become more analytically driven, and the 3 is more important than ever. Those guys wouldn't be hyped today like they were back then.  With Haliburton, we see a player who does everything well with high BBIQ. His biggest weakness was his jump shot mechanics, but we see now that he can pull it off at the NBA level off the dribble."
"Same can be said in 2018-2019 when he got hurt. I think they were the 4th seed by Christmas. That’s with under developed Ingram, Lonzo and Kyle Kuzma as his supporting cast. People just like to forget/discredit Brons greatness for some reason"

"Dinwiddie &amp; Bryant are coming off season-ending injuries, Neto, Holiday, and KCP are all mediocre role players, and Kyle Kuzma is Kyle Kuzma. There's no guarantee these players perform well enough to earn minutes as the season progresses, that's typically why you invest in youth and a deep bench.   I think the most noteworthy thing with Washington this season is how they'll manage the young core of Rui/Deni/Kuzma/Kispert. We have no idea how they'll be used or if they can work together."
"Kyle Kuzma was a pretty good defender with the Lakers when he had AD and LeBron behind him to erase a lot of his mistakes, but [you can see the difference when he doesn't.](https://streamable.com/mv2bct) I'm guessing with Westbrook having switched places with Kuz it'll now be he who looks pretty good on D."
"For Kyle Kuzma, Chase Young, and a lifetime supply of Ethiopian food."
&gt; why is Kyle Kuzma taking 8 threes  this is the funniest thing i’ve ever read. this guy is in for a season.
why is Kyle Kuzma taking 8 threes
"I graduated from the Kyle ""DeGeneres"" Kuzma Financial School, and he taught me to diversify my bonds. That the interest you accumulate from a saving account is no where near as profitable as investing in stocks or markets. He also went on to say that spending $5000 a month on bleaching your hair is a good investment in your brand."
"May be controversial, but I've been saying this a lot:    Kyle Kuzma"
Kyle Kuzma to retire and coach instead.
AD injured and Kyle Kuzma injury to the brain. You a hard capper

Kyle Kuzma looks like Ariana Grande.

You forgot my 6'9 Ellen Degeneres Kyle Kuzma
Kyle Kuzma is older than Aaron Gordon
"Kyle Kuzma.  Oh, wait."
Anthony Davis is only 2 years older than Kyle Kuzma
Uh...   &gt;Pressure has been applied to the front office  Blazers' offseason additions:   * Larry Nance Jr.   * Cody Zeller  Wizards' offseason additions:   * Spencer Dinwiddie * Kyle Kuzma * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  * Montrezl Harrell * Aaron Holiday   The Wizards had a bigger offseason than Portland did.
"Lmao like what, signing Spencer Dinwiddie and Kyle Kuzma? Wow finals bound"
"Be honest, none of us would pay any attention to this man if he wasn’t on the Lakers. And he’s not a bad player! But he’s definitely got the Kyle Kuzma spotlight."
Kyle “Jim Boylen” Kuzma.
Kyle Kuzma totally wanted to get traded and is taking his talents to DC to continue his growth process.
Kyle Kuzma was real coach on the floor for the Lakers last season.   Am I doing this right?
"Ok but Kuzma actually did spend four years in college and graduated with a degree. It's part of the reason he looked like he could hang with Ingram and Lonzo his first few years in the league - he was significantly older than them.  Kyle Kuzma is older than Aaron Gordon, and a few months younger than Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins, they were one-and-doners and he did four years at Utah."
"I also think that the ""Just Print Money"" line is misused by some politicians and pundits. If we so chose, we could easily raise enough funds from taxing the wealthy to have a small surplus (especially if we pair that with military spending cuts). Once we're no longer deficit spending during good times (not now), time is on our side. We can responsibly print money every year, allow natural inflation to devalue our debt, and grow our economy to better handle the amount of debt we hold.  But make no mistake: we have *plenty* of money. Kyle Kuzma is just plain wrong. We could absolutely tax the wealthy more than we are now. We need not have piled up as much debt as our state and federal governments have over the past decades in the pursuit of giving the wealthy tax breaks."
"The title should read more like the Ben Simmons drama and star with ""Kyle Kuzma has concluded..."""
"it means Kyle Kuzma gets news from his Twitter timeline  because otherwise he would see outside of the NBA media bubble, the government shutdown is getting way way way more coverage."
"Kyle Kuzma, Economist, r/nba."
"&gt; The issue isn't purely the unvaccinated, it is vaccinated NBA players not doing their job of promoting vaccine utilization. Instead, as we are seeing from Kyle Kuzma and others, they are doing ""whataboutism"" is ignore the fact that vaccine hesitancy is a real problem, and yet the vast majority of the league is doing nothing to stop it.  To burnish this case, Lebron is vaccinated but is backing up Draymond's anti-vax comments (even if Draymond himself is vaccinated). So you have vaccinated players going full anti-vax and ""my body my choice!"" towards vaccines, which is absolutely not what the league and public health officials want."
"The issue isn't purely the unvaccinated, it is vaccinated NBA players not doing their job of promoting vaccine utilization. Instead, as we are seeing from Kyle Kuzma and others, they are doing ""whataboutism"" is ignore the fact that vaccine hesitancy is a real problem, and yet the vast majority of the league is doing nothing to stop it.  There ya go champ."
The last two winners were Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram. They were both drafted and played for the Lakers.  That means there are two candidates that can potentially win next year. They are both on new teams with roles that are a better for for them and could be ready to take a leap.  Lonzo Ball - Chicago Bulls  Kyle Kuzma - Washington Wizards  Jokes aside I think they are very solid possibilities and have shown flashes of legitimate potential. I’m excited to see how they do.
Nba Champion Kyle Kuzma*
"Because the reach of Lakers media is fucking massive, and if you make sure people are hearing a lot about something or someone then they'll grow an opinion of something or someone. It's why *everyone* seems to have a view on Caruso - and even know who he is - despite being a pretty unremarkable player.  2019 'Kyle Kuzma NEXT SUPERSTAR??' was being rammed down everyone's throat, so non-Lakers resented him, then LeBron came and he wasn't that good so now there's a whole bunch of anti-Kuzma stuff."
"All young socialites get disrespected  Tyler Herro, Ben Simmons, and Kyle Kuzma are like 1st team disrespect"

"I’m vaccinated lol I just think it’s dumb to “chastise” people and it only leads to people digging in harder.  Let’s not forget this thread stems from Kyle kuzma, who is definitely vaccinated, saying “no comment” and people are up in arms"
Horrible overpay. People keep talking about potential with this dude. Still has yet to be realized. 200 milly is just plain dumb for this slightly more consistent Kyle Kuzma.
Oh damn sorry Dr. Kuzma. Also your patient Kyle is dumb as fuck. Maybe look into some treatments for that
Kyle Kuzma is about to sue you

Kyle Kuzma baptized his career
Kyle Kuzma must be to young to remember Emmitt Smith's short stint of being a talking head. Emmitt Smith was paid millions of dollars to be an NFL media guy.  Here is my evidence that debunks Kyle Kuzma. [https://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=1222](https://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=1222)
Kyle Kuzma does not know how to write a complete sentence.
"Or the third option was for one of the perimeter players who didn’t get beat (Ingles, Bogdanovich, Mitchell) rotate to cover the open man and then the player that did get beat (Clarkson) rotate to cover the open man on the wing while Gobert covers the rim. But it’s not like Gobert did that anyways considering Mann and Jackson straight up drove AT Gobert. Sounds like a coaching and Gobert issue, not a perimeter player defense issue. I’ve seen Kyle Kuzma become a good defender. Clarkson had 20 points. Hard to win when your max contract player can’t back down a 6’9 Paul George, Marcus Morris, and Nic Batum"
"Eh, don’t really care until he shows me it in the playoffs. I’ve seen Kyle Kuzma put up stats on losing teams, and I don’t overvalue the regular season because “it’s a bigger sample size.”"
"&gt; Especially because guys like Nate Burleson, who were solid but not great skill position players, likely have a lot less general knowledge of the game than like a George Hill or a Darren Collison would (comparable cross league comparisons in my eyes).  You think George Hill and Darren Collison know more about football than Nate Burleson? Kuz is talking about NFL players analyzing the NFL, not the NBA.  &gt; [Kyle Kuzma] NFL player turned analyst maturity level talking about &amp; analyzing **their respected sport** [sic] is far superior to the NBA guys.. too many clowns and thirst… those guys help you understand the sport."
To argue Kyle Kuzma became a spot up shooter is a bit silly. LeBron gave him the ball and plenty of opportunities to excel and step up. He just didn't take advantage of them and had a good game once every couple months. He didn't have the ability to be consistent. His value became based in his defensive contributions.
An injured Kyle Kuzma.
"Ah yes, I can see the woj bomb now…. Lakers trade kyle kuzma for cash exceptions to the team to be named later."
"I can’t think of a witty insult about how Kyle Kuzma sucks, but he does. If LeBron tied strings to him like a puppet, even then Kuzma would suck."
"Booker and Lillard will be nuts to watch together, especially on the international stage. Respect to them for competing in the games when it's become so common for star players to skip this nowadays, to the point that fucking Kyle Kuzma was no joke expected to suit up for the FIBA USA team in '19 before he hurt his ankle"
"This is misleading. A lot of celebritiy tracking is done through bots making API calls. Every time account X makes any changes at all then a bot notifies whomever at TMZ or some group that makes money on this and they pump out an autogenerated article in 5 minutes.   Now the thing is that instead of paying someone minimum wage to constantly hit F5 on Kyle Kuzma three programmers were paid 90K+ a year to create, maintain, and improve this system."
Doing what he does. 1 great game followed by 2 bad games.    Hes the good version of Kyle Kuzma

Kyle Kuzma playing Shanghai
"I think it's more likely Lowry uses the threat of getting a 3/90 contract from New Orleans as leverage to get Toronto to trade him to his preferred destination (wherever that is) for similar money.   Like let's use the Lakers as an example, since [there have been recent reports that he's interested in going there.](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/.amp/news/nba-report-demar-derozan-and-kyle-lowry-reportedly-interested-in-joining-los-angeles-lakers) If the Lakers trade Kyle Kuzma and Montrezl Harrell there along with the 22nd pick then they too could offer Lowry a 3 year $90 million contract via sign and trade. Up till now the assumption would have been that that's not enough for Toronto to trade Lowry, but now that there's the threat that they could lose him for nothing, they'd probably prefer that instead.   The same thing could apply with the Sixers or any other team he wanted to go to who's over the cap. All New Orleans having this room to offer him a deal means is that Lowry now has the leverage to basically orchestrate his own sign and trade anywhere he wants with little to no pushback from Toronto. I think he's playing David Griffin, rather than him having a legit desire to go play for a lottery team."

"Where did I say that it does?   I’m simply explaining the simple logic of Kuzma, a young rich athlete, preferring to live in LA than Orlando. R/nba seems to refuse acknowledging the fact that money + clout buys a person access to things normal people can’t understand which makes living in big cities way more appealing to them while at the same time ridiculing them for being rich and famous when they do something we don’t like or perceive as not being hardworking (as in the case of Kyle Kuzma, people literally hate him bc he is into fashion, dyes his hair, and has a major endorsement deal as a bench player).   I fully recognize money doesn’t buy happiness but it sure as hell can buy access to make living in a glamour city a whole lot more appealing than living in Orlando."
"Do you think rich young athletes really live the same life as you? Do you not understand that when it comes to big cities class is everything? These cities are literally set up to cater to the elite, we as non wealthy/well-connected people exist completely differently from them. Like 5 o’clock traffic at the courthouse does not exist for Kyle Kuzma come on now lol"
We'll give you Kyle Kuzma. Who says no? :-)
why kyle kuzma when yu can send 2 random ball guys who can pass and shoot

"Gonna be honest, as an OKC fan, I do not want Kyle Kuzma at all and I don’t care if we’re only giving up a late second round pick for him. His attitude seems like it sucks and he’s already on the back half of his 20s. It’s not like he’s some young asset at this point."
"Michigan would be good:  **Starters**: Monte Morris - Devin Booker - Miles Bridges - Draymond Green - Javale McGee  **Bench:** Bryn Forbes, Edmond Sumner, Denzel Valentine, Josh Jackson  **Coach:** Magic Johnson  **Cheerleader:** Jalen Rose  **Water boy:** Kyle Kuzma"

"Great news for Wiz fans. We can now look forward to more delusional mock trade offers like Marcus Smart, a late 1st, and a game worn Antione Walker jersey for Beal.   Or Beal for Kyle Kuzma and some autographed Smush Parker kicks."
"Also Vogel is a coach that gets his guys to buy in defensively, I think his offensive sets are something out of 2005 re-run of Hey Arnold. But that’s another convo, I expect Buddy to play a little bit better defense with stalwart defenders Davis and James by his side. Plus Frank ain’t gonna let him skate by on Defense he even got Kyle Kuzma to buy on defense which is a feat in and of itself."
Call me crazy but Buddy Hield is better than Kyle Kuzma no?
Kyle Kuzma and 2 seconds here we come..
You put two of those in each corner and make them release like Kyle Korver and I bet both my nuts Lebron wins every championship until retirement evsn if the other two guys on the court are Kuzma and Schroeder.
I'm sure Kyle Kuzma was the missing piece to our chemistry

"Yes. It would be harder but I was told no team could move Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook with those contracts and it happened. Twice for CP3. Some team will take on your bad salary if you throw in some other pieces or picks. If they want Westbrook, they can make those salaries almost match and give Washington Kuzma and a ton of picks to get it done. They're not getting CP3 or Westbrook without sending a nice chuck of salary in the trade.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-mulling-russell-westbrook-trade-for-kyle-kuzma-dennis-schroder-and-talen-horton-tucker-per-report/"
"Most people would say no. The better fit at PG on paper would be a Kyle Lowry because of his ability to space the floor and shoot the 3.  I however would argue that the Lakers aren’t as desperate for “shooting” as they are for offensive playmaking outside of LeBron, easy transition points, and rebounding. All of which Westbrook brings in spades.  I don’t care what the fit is honestly. If you can bring in a player like Westbrook for what presumably would be some package of Schroder, Kuzma, and 1st/2nd round picks you do it.  AD wants to play on the perimeter all the time anyway now so you can have plenty of spacing if need be."

Kyle Kuzma is as good as Jason Tatum so how about trading him straight up.
Kyle Kuzma is older than Aaron Gordon.

"Zion played less than half the season... Was not as good as Randle. And that's not mentioning D'Angelo Russel, Jordan Clarkson, Brook Lopez, and Kyle Kuzma. The latter 2 of which were playing heavy minutes on the last 2 championship teams."
"funny because all the talk before the playoffs were about how weak the lakers were outside of the big 2. ""they cant win with their 3rd best player being kyle kuzma!!"" now they're a damn superteam. lmao"
"Kyle Kuzma is a rhythm player, it’s simple. If he is getting inconsistent minutes he will play that way. People forget Kuzma was a decent young player before Bron got there, and he was serviceable in Bron’s first year as a Laker. But once they got Anthony Davis and made him into a 3&amp;D guy, you start to see the holes in his game. He needs consistency."
"Remember when lakers were just lonzo ball brandon ingram and Kyle kuzma then 2 years later lakers were one overhaul trade from landing a big 3 of kawhi AD and lebron? Maybe its unlikely but goddamn it , im not gonna say its impossible"

Does Kyle Kuzma really qualify as “young talent” anymore?
"&gt; for no reason  Lol I get that ppl might be being too harsh but have you seen Kyle Kuzma play in this most recent playoffs? Even disregarding his absurd contract, he legitimately looked like he shouldn’t be in the NBA anymore."
"I know NBA Twitter has convinced you that Kyle Kuzma is a scrub so you see him as ‘nothing’   But in reality you’d be getting a 25 year old player who fits your young cores’ timeline on a team friendly deal, with championship experience.   Pop himself said Kuzma reminded him of a young Ginobli, and he could easily fit into Derozans slot and actually give you guys 3 point shooting from the wing.  As opposed to actual nothing if Derozan walks"
"I think it's obvious Lakers would have to acquire both guys via sign-and-trades.  Move Kuzma package to Spurs for DeMar  Move THT package to Raptors for Lowry  A lot of extra moving parts there - will Pop ever sign off on a trade to help the Lakers (apparently the Spurs have had interest in Kuzma in the past)? Can the Raptors flip the rest of the THT package (KCP contract, etc.) for a younger asset?  My feeling from the Raptors side is that Lowry goes to Masai/Bobby and says he wants to go to the Lakers, then Kyle will be a Laker."

kyle kuzma would be a good choice too for pf
"Imma be real with you. It is flat out disrespectful for you to even think about comparing Sexton to Kuzma.   Sexton is a proven 20+ ppg scorer on above average efficiency. He’s also showed some improved playmaking. He is 22 years old and came in the league at 19 and has improved every season.   Kyle Kuzma was ALWAYS just a chucker on a bad team. He was inefficient, couldn’t shoot, couldn’t defend, couldn’t make plays for others, below average free throws shooter. He just took a lot of shots on shit teams. Came in the league at 23 and hasn’t improved.   The only people who genuinely thought Kuzma had all star/borderline all star potential were delusional homers, Tatum haters, and or people who just simply didn’t understand basketball.  Please don’t make it sound like Cavs fans holding out hope for Sextons development are in the same boat as those who thought Kuzma would be a star"
"Bro you gotta take off the homer glasses. Sexton is POTENTIALLY an all-star but absolutely is not there yet. Because he's not winning games.  Time and time again people don't learn: if young guys are getting good numbers on a tanking team, that doesn't mean anything one way or another.  See: Kyle Kuzma. Trust me, I had to learn it myself the hard way too"

"Nope, I never said superteams are more likely to have injuries. Nor am I suggesting that they're less likely to win the title than other squads.  What I am saying is that injuries are a major factor in whether superteams win the title. The comment you wrote — the one I was responding to — implicitly creates an asterisk for Giannis' title run, as though it was unthinkable that Brooklyn or LA could be derailed by injuries.   That's simply not the case; it turns out having Joe Harris and Kyle Kuzma as your fourth best players puts a lot of pressure on the superstars to be healthy. When you made your prediction seven months ago — and, lest we forget, you confidently stated that ""Giannis gives up a chance to ever win a ring"" by signing the supermax — it probably would've been wise to take into account AD or Kyrie's history of injuries.   You didn't, and you don't get to sneakily draw up an asterisk to save face for a smug and terrible take."

Oh yeah?  Well the West has Kyle Kuzma  Beat that
This is his Kyle Kuzma moment.
"Yeah but during their respective rookie seasons, Kyle Kuzma is flat out better than Tatum."
Kyle kuzma of the East!
Now I see where Kyle Kuzma got his Orlando opinion from
"Literally Draymond Green has said the same thing about Kyle Kuzma this season, but nephews gonna downvote your post cause they know more then one of the highest IQ players in the league"
But is he better than Kyle Kuzma?
Latvian Kyle Kuzma
Remember when Laker fans were saying that Kyle Kuzma was better than Jason Tatum?
Kyle Kuzma and THT
When CP3 literally pushes Schroeder out of bounds and nothing is called. Also him tripping Kyle Kuzma(I think that was called) and Crowder gets away with so much of that “physical play” that 99% of players would get called on them.
"Kyle Kuzma, the future MVP?"
The Lakers' 2nd best/available player that year was 2nd year Kyle Kuzma. Steph had a top 5 defense around him and the 'greatest offensive player' couldn't pull off a playoff berth.
You know what i don’t think Kyle kuzma has either
"Its sometimes disheartening though, if you talk to a casual fan of basketball not from Milwuakee, New Orleans, or maybe Philadelphia about Jrue Holiday youre more likely to get a ""who?"" Response than anything. I wouldnt be surprised if Kyle Kuzma had more name recognition, which is sad, bc a calender year ago he was a net negative player. Jrue's not the flashiest guy but has a really smart, physical game. Hope the Nets series can really make ppl aware of him if he can pull a Dort on Harden while hitting some clutch baskets."

Kyle Kuzma is the best at the “you know” between every single statement game
well he's either Jayson Tatum or Kyle Kuzma
"""I got it, fuck outta here"" - ~~Carmelo Anthony~~ Kyle Kuzma 2021"
Phoenix need to go after big men this offseason. They let fucking Kyle Kuzma out rebound them ffs. Can’t remember who it was exactly but Mikal and maybe Crowder outnumbered him and he grabbed one.
"Kyle ""Draymond Green"" Kuzma"
"Kyle ""Dennis Rodman with delusions of shooting ability"" Kuzma"
Suns should thank Kyle Kuzma for his effort of keeping this game from becoming a blow out
 This mf Kyle Kuzma missing easy layups but got Winnie Harlow 😫
Why play Kyle Kuzma when you have Jared Dudley ???
Kyle Kuzma is very lucky to be on a Lebron James led team
How’re you gonna let Kyle Kuzma out rebound you?
COME ON KUZ!  &gt; 7:44		Kyle Kuzma misses 2-foot tip shot	70 - 89	 &gt;  &gt; 7:44		Kyle Kuzma offensive rebound	70 - 89	 &gt;  &gt; 7:44		Kyle Kuzma misses tip shot	70 - 89	 &gt;  &gt; 7:44		Kyle Kuzma offensive rebound	70 - 89	 &gt;  &gt; 7:44		Kyle Kuzma misses two point shot	70 - 89	 &gt;  &gt; 7:45		Kyle Kuzma offensive rebound	70 - 89
Kyle Kuzma with his Drummond impersonation lmao
Kyle kuzma has disappointed on so many shots. But i gotta give it to the guy he’s been crashing the boards and making good passes so credit where it’s due.
4 of yall under the basket and can't get the ball away from Kyle Kuzma lmao
I love Kyle kuzma
Kyle Kuzma is so much trash. This motherfucker better be gone in the offseason.
Kyle Kuzma is an aborted fetus’ ejaculate conceived in a dumpster raccoon just trying to survive
Replace Kyle Kuzma with some homeless guy outside Staples
Lol is Kyle kuzma legally blind? I've never seen someone miss so many defensive assignments while moving around so much
Kyle Kuzma has always been trash.
Kyle Kuzma doing his best Tyler Herro impression
Kyle Kuzma is so trash this series
I still have nightmares of when he played Kyle Kuzma at Center
They really hate Kyle Kuzma in the Magic subreddit over some comments he made that weren’t even directly towards anyone or the organization lol
But how could u generalize an entire fanbase over one guy. Your franbase had hundreds of people harass someone and their family for having a bad game. And the worse part is you guys have done it multiple times. You guys even set up a petition for kyle Kuzma to not get an nba ring that over 18k people signed. One guy being a pos isn’t a representation of an entire fanbase but thousands of pieces of Shits is a pretty bad look
Davis Bertans vs Tony Snell vs Kyle Kuzma in a triple threat ladder match!
Kyle 'Max Player' Kuzma in 3 years' time 😂
