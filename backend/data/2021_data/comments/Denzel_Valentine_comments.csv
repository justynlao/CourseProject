"Cobe has been struggling but he’s starting to get it.  He’s going to be really, really good  Denzel Valentine can ball.  If he stays healthy, he’s going to get paid decently"
"That trade would not make the bulls better. What are you thinking?  Simmons, LaVine, Patrick Williams, Thad, WCJ. That’s an okay to good starting 5.   Bench: Gafford, Arch, Denzel Valentine, ????"
"Zach Lavine, Coby White, Otto Porter Jr, Wendell Carter Junior, Denzel Valentine, Tomas Satoransky, Patrick William, Gafford (idk his first name)"
Dumbass Denzel valentine
"They have Denzel Valentine looking like a solid rotation player, looked like he'd be out of the league shortly after his rookie deal before tbh. Billy is working wonders with this team."
"We don't let Zach be the primary ball handler he has to be the primary ball handler. Without Sato we don't have a point guard other than Coby.   We have Coby play point guard and stagger his minutes from Zach. Zach's essentially our backup point guard, and our last 5 minutes point guard. He closes games and right now he's the point guard behind Coby.   If we had Sato he'd be playing off ball like earlier in the season. Right now the offense runs through the Suite life and Denzel Valentine. As well as Wendell."
Pretty much everyone but Denzel Valentine
Denzel Valentine will win MVP
is denzel valentine finally good?
"Well too bad, it’s Denzel Valentine"
"Not many rooks, even guys who stay 4 years in college, have the skill to come in and make above replacement level impact on a winning / contending team. Most talented guys that struggled their frosh season make their leap 2nd season and enter draft then. PP improved a bit as a soph then his numbers and efficiency actually regressed a junior before blowing up as a senior.  4 year guys becoming good role players in general let alone as a rook are even rarer than 2 year guys... since Lillard key names are:  Draymond Green, CJ McCollum, JJ Reddick, Jeremy Lin, Larry Nance Jr, Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Denzel Valentine, all 3 Plumlee Brothers 2 of the Zeller brothers (not Cody) Taj Gibson   And technically Jimmy Butler. Probably forgetting a few but none better than Hield/Brogdon. That's clearly much less than 2nd year guys."
"Yeah he came back to campus to visit one time while I was there, wish I could have met him.   I used to see the basketball players in the dining hall all the time, once I saw Denzel Valentine crush a whole box of fruity pebbles. No joke."
Brooklyn should trade Durant to the Bulls. Hes clearly washed. Bulls can give up Denzel Valentine and a late draft pick in 2022
Saw that this post said Denzel Valentine and I thought “there’s no way this is a good highlight”
Denzel Valentine is your Ben Simmons at home.
"Well ig it was nasty  More importantly, Denzel Valentine is such a smooth name"
Denzel Valentine
"I can’t rule anything out that involves Jerry being cheap so that’s fair. I don’t really think we play better without him personally, I think any minutes he takes away from Denzel Valentine are a net positive. Similarly to Lauri, he just can’t stay healthy and we have improved collectively as a team significantly throughout this year, our first with a new HC (the previous HC being arguably the worst in NBA history) while those players sat. I don’t think we are necessarily better without them, but it does make it awfully fair to call their value into question."
Denzel Valentine
Denzel valentine + Otto porter jr + an unprotected '21 first
"Denzel Valentine, I swear he thinks he’s Curry out there with some of the 3s he attempts. Sadly for all of us, Denzel Valentine is not Curry (sadly for him cause he bricks them, sadly for us cause we have to watch him brick them)"
Denzel Valentine being 27 already
Denzel Valentine
The Denzel Valentine special
Denzel Valentine
"Everyone in the preseason “I really like lauri and Carter”   Now: “the bulls starting lineup is so bad, Lavine obviously can’t succeed and they are obviously better when Thad young and Denzel valentine are playing”"
Should Denzel Valentine and Doug McDerrmott get in?
Zach-less Bulls are gonna be rough  hope you're all ready for the Denzel Valentine Experience!
"Thad Young's been their second best player this season, sadly.  Also, the team is incredibly young. Outside of Thad (13 years in the league), Temple (10), Otto Porter Jr. (7, and injured), Lavine (5), and Satoransky (4), everyone else has 3 years of NBA experience of fewer, including starters/rotation players Markannen, WCJ, Coby White, Patrick Williams, Denzel Valentine, and Gafford. On top of that, of the young players, it seems like only LaVine (if he still counts as being young) and maybe Markannen have borderline all-star potential. (The jury is out on Patrick Williams.)"
All he needs is Denzel Valentine and it’s full on romance there at SexLand.
Denzel Valentine
"Great take with Denzel Valentine over Mike Muscala. I know its close, but I 100% agree with you there."
"Fr, I don't think anyone doubts his talent in the slightest. But it is good validation when these dude get sent down and just smoke everybody too.  Denzel Valentine got sent down for a game last year and put up 25/18/8"
He has those Denzel valentine vibes
I don’t think I’ve seen Denzel Valentine have a good game his entire career
Not sure why you are getting downvotes my guy. Big bulls fan and TBJ has come in and taken minutes from Denzel Valentine and Aminu and basically sewn up the backup 3 spot. His defense is the real deal and he can hit shots at times. His decision making isn't always 100 but I could see him getting limited playoff burn for us for sure.
"Denzel Valentine makes the most boneheaded plays sometimes and if he can't make a 3 is essentially useless on the court. Coby White in the same vein, but he probably has a little more upside on offense. He's just not a good pg right now. Also both these guys play terrible defense"
Denzel Valentine because he genuinely thinks he’s the best player in the world  he makes a nice pass one play but then follow it up with 3 early shot clock heat checks
Coby white or denzel valentine cuz they can't play basketball well
Until the last 8 minutes it was randomly a really strong game from Denzel Valentine of all people. He really kept us afloat along with Vuc
I remember being so convinced Denzel Valentine was gonna be a 3 &amp; D star
"Every fan base can be super harsh towards their players at times. Our fanbase always piles on Lauri and Coby after a bad game (WCJ used to be in that group before he got traded). Some other guys like Denzel Valentine and formerly Otto Porter can get hate, but the vast majority is directed at our admittedly disappointing #7 picks"
Good lord do we need theis. Also Lauri’s defence makes makes him look unplayable. And denzel valentine should NOT be played over TBJ
Denzel Valentine
We are getting dad dicked by Denzel Valentine    Just fade me fam
"The Bulls arent well rounded enough forvthe Playoffs but too good and competitive for a deeper Lottery Look.    So, work on your weakness and the young core.  Don't touch: LaVine, Williams, Thad Young, Temple.   Bring in a Center who protects the the rim, sets screens and stretches the floor - Myles Turner for WCJ, Chandler Hutchinson and a 2nd Round Pick.  Lonzo Ball should provide pass first and more defense than you get with Coby White. Let him go off the bench as 2 Guard (with Satoransky for example as the PG) . Get Lonzo either for a 2nd rounder plus Denzel Valentine or see if he wants to come in the FA (he is a RFA)   With that you strengthen the bright side: Good tempo, good bench - but work on the efficiency and turnovers in that.  Lauri will have troubles finding his money wish in the contract offers. He's hurt so often and inconsistent. Healthy and ready, he is a cornerstone of the Franchise but more as Tony Kukoc than as Pippen to our Jordan!  Get a SF that gives you 10pts and defense. Get rid off (trade away, or let go): Felicio, Kornet, Hutchinson, WCJ, Arcidiacono, Gafford.   Get a more balanced team with better roleplayers to provide a 2nd Star enough money and Space to go join next to LaVine."
Can’t forget our GOAT lineup of   PG: Cam Payne  SG: Denzel Valentine SF: Justin Holiday PF: Paul Zipser C: Cristiano Felicio
"Dray is just a poor man's Denzel Valentine without Steph, KD, and Klay"
"Klay, by far.  Draymond without Steph and Klay is just a poor man's Denzel Valentine."
"Denzel Valentine is my dark horse LVP candidate. Dude is hilariously bad, like, he just makes you wonder what the fuck is going through his head. Doesn't help that White is also quite sub par and they desperately need a guard to pair with Lavine, whose incredible, not to mention they weren't going for a tank unlike some other players mentioned here, not that that should necessarily factor in."
Denzel Valentine
"and Denzel Valentine, maybe."
Denzel Valentine
"Denzel Valentine. Bulls fans think this guy is the next Jordan, but he's Joe Dumars at best."
"I pray that we avoid the play in or at least get through it easily. The Bulls without LaVine beating us one time on a back2back and almost beating us in the first game as well (props to Denzel Valentine for saving us) are really making me fear the play in. No matter what we do, we can't seem to get over one or two games over .500."
*Denzel Valentine beat the Bulls 2 days ago
"Yeah, probably. It's either him or Denzel Valentine."
Where does Denzel Valentine rank in this. I love when he doesn't touch the basketball and can't hurt his team
Denzel Valentine.
Ik y’all seen Denzel Valentine try to hit a similar shot... lol jus goes to show how well curry can shoot the ball
Denzel Valentine punching air rn
Damian “Denzel Valentine” Lillard
Why he gotta do this to Denzel Valentine.
Denzel Valentine
Who does he think he is? Denzel Valentine?
Denzel Valentine would like a word.
Denzel Valentine taking notes ✍️✍️
"The last time the Bulls won a championship was when dial up was popular and youre still on that while in the present day Denzel Valentine is pulling up for 3. Anyway hope you can manage to scoot into the play in game, think that’ll be fun."
"[My favorite highlight!](https://twitter.com/Dame_Lillard/status/1384009076414156808) That was vicious! Also, what's up with RoCo's airballs? That 4th quarter was Denzel Valentine-sque shooting. Glad to see Nurkic doing well though, he's a beast!   On the other side, the Grizzlies could be a tough first-round matchup for any team and I definitely see them advancing to the playoffs and winning a couple of games."
"Steph, LeBron, maybe KD or Lillard are the only players I can see not being mad if they shoot that. Harden maybe too? Either way, Denzel Valentine is *not* on that list haha"
Not when you’re Denzel Valentine. Not ever.
Denzel Valentine. Why? Look at the front page.
Denzel Valentine: imma hit a dagger right here.
"On behalf of the Miami Heat fanbase and the entire population of South Florida, I'd like to wholeheartedly thank Denzel Valentine for his service."
"You should probably add that Denzel Valentine was a huge contributor in the comeback, going 3/3 from 3 until this shot and having like 4 steals on defense in the 4th quarter alone  This shot was his ""heat check"", but it's still inexcusable to take it like that lol"
"i feel like a lot of people are gonna miss the full context of this clip  - the bulls have been down as much as 22 this game. it has been a complete shutout since the first quarter  - the bulls resident bucket getter, zach lavine (who has documented gripes with valentine’s hero complex) is on the bench tonight  - miami cannot miss from 3 apparently, with duncan alone putting up 6 in the first half and jimmy playing extremely well  - they have been chipping at this lead for the entire 4th quarter, and miami is still scoring every couple possessions during their slump  - miami has used 2 timeouts in a span of like 3 minutes because the bulls are HOT, namely coby n vooch scoring at will on a strict miami defense  - denzel valentine gets the ball down 5 points and pulls up from the hash, and all of that work went down the drain. you could feel the optimism just die for the bulls fanbase"
Denzel Valentine has no fucking business taking that shot   And most definitely not with 19 seconds left on the shot clock
Probably because Denzel Valentine is not Steph or Dame
You just compared the 2 greatest extended range shooters to Denzel Valentine
"Yes it might have to do with Dame and Curry having the 2 longest ranges we’ve ever seen vs Denzel Valentine, a bottom 20 player in the NBA who I have never seen take that shot"
"Bro I was convinced that Denzel Valentine would be the next Draymond Green. He was a four year Michigan State star with same kinda body type  and a great distributor, better than Draymond was in college, and a good jump shot. Sure Valentine was considered a poor defender but Dray wasn't touted as a future DPOY candidate coming out of college either. I really wanted the Hawks to grab him.  I'm dumb as shit."
The Denzel Valentine-Tyus Jones duel was pretty hype
i hate you denzel valentine
Denzel Valentine is the tank commander whether the bulls like it or not
Denzel Valentine is one of the only players in the league that I genuinely despise
"I literally have no idea how to discern between a bunch of former Chicago bench guys; Daniel Gafford, Denzel Valentine, Chandler Hutchinson. Seriously I don't even know what positions they play"
how can you not trust Denzel Valentine and Archie-deyaka-now as your long term point guards?
"The last 10 drafts below. Out of 20 picks, only Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, MPJ and Julius Randle are on the level of Pascal and you could argue he is better than all of them. You are way more likely to get guys like Coby White and Romeo Langford than a Jamal Murray and Bam Adebayo.  7th picks: Killian Hayes, Coby White, Wendall Carter, Lauri Markannen, Jamal Murray, Emmanuel Mudiay, Julius Randle, Ben McLemore, Harrison Barnes, Bismack Biyombo  14th picks: Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, MPJ, Bam Adebayo, Denzel Valentine, Cameron Payne, TJ Warren, Shabazz Muhammad, John Henson, Marcus Morris"
Holiday back to be being Denzel Valentine level on offense
"They were 11th last year with Garret Temple and Denzel Valentine playing the 3 alot, is DeRozan really that much worse than them"
Bud is the Denzel Valentine of coaching
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
I don't know if Denzel Valentine is the literal worst (he might not have even been the worst player on the Bulls roster this year since we also had Felicio) but I thought he played himself out of the league during the last half of the season. I don't know why any team would want to sign him.
I don’t think it’s Denzel “Stephen Curry” Valentine. He can shoot it and isn’t a bad ball handler. His shot selection is pretty bad though
I feel bad for Denzel valentine when he sees this just randomly scrolling through Reddit
Denzel Valentine. He’s the worst shot chucker I’ve ever laid my eyes on. Would be absolutely ridiculous in the CBA.
Denzel Valentine
"I once went to a Summer League game to watch Lonzo/Tatum/Dennis Smith Jr etc play and ended up seeing Denvel Valentine and Cameron Payne during their shootaround before the game started.   I shit you not they missed about 20/22 shots and I literally thought to myself that these guys will be out of the league in a couple years time.   Denzel Valentine is still Denzel Valentine but my god I would've never thought that Cameron Payne would be the leading scorer in a Conference Finals game, huge kudos to his growth"
we will give you denzel valentine for ben simmons
Where my boy Denzel valentine at should be top 3 at the minimum
Denzel valentine
Good luck to any team duped into giving Denzel Valentine an offer
Denzel Valentine
"He plays great defense, has good BBIQ on both sides but becomes borderline unplayable in offense sometimes, so he shouldn't be a 25-30 mpg guy when he's off. This is because his scoring comes from spotting up or cutting. When he's playing badly he doesn't contribute much offensively and that's the real problem (although he does know how to make the extra pass YES I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU DENZEL VALENTINE)"
you will throw in Denzel valentine and you will like it
No theyll add Torrey Craig and Denzel valentine then run it back
Nobody will know who he is if he doesn't play next to lebron and Lakers. He'd be like Denzel Valentine
Trade him to Chicago with picks for Denzel Valentine
"He’s my 2nd least fav of the Lavine era wings, right behind my sworn nemesis Denzel Valentine"
Musta got the memo from Denzel valentine
Denzel valentine
"I'll give you Denzel Valentine, Felicio, Sato, and some old MJ highlight tapes."
"I thought the same about Denzel Valentine lol  Also, I thought we'd be a top 5 defense this season"
Prime Denzel Valentine but even worse shooting
thats a denzel valentine shot
Denzel valentine at 15.   Mf stole my happiness for 4yrs
Where is Denzel Valentine? Literally man is a walking blooper reel.
Winner is Denzel Valentine
"I got some of my Bulls gear signed by Denzel Valentine at the United Center when he was coming out of the tunnel for warm ups and he shook up with me and told me he’s got a game to win. The Bulls proceeded to lose to the Wizards that night. Man, I thought Denzel was going to be a beast."
Denzel Valentine has more confidence than the rest of the league combined
"yep, on the Bulls sub in particular, tried pointing out that Hoiberg wasnt an NBA level coach, supreme downvotes years ago, now its the consensus  When drafted, people that said Lauri Markonen was a soft big that cant box out, defend, rebound, play with toughness or do anything other than spot up shoot, massive downvotes   Now its consensus opinion...  Denzel Valentine, nothing to get excited over, will barely be  a 4th guard option... what do you think the consensus is? Lol"
Denzel valentine was a summer league star
PG Cassius Winston SG Denzel Valentine SF Miles Bridges  PF Draymond Green C Jaren Jackson Jr  B Brynn Forbes B Xavier Tillman B Gary Harris  B Aaron Henry  B Magic Johnson Coach Tom Izzo
"Fair point, but Doug was a much better pure scorer, larger, and more athletic than Valentine, and is generally more mobile than Luka. Valentine is a very skilled and smart basketball player much like Luka, but often times that just isn’t enough. My point is simply being great in the NCAA isn’t enough. I don’t think Luka should have fallen so far, but it makes sense.   On the positive side, Doug completely reinvented his game when he got to the league. He went from high post ball dominant forward to catch and shoot specialist. I think Denzel tried to take his playmaking skills to the next level when maybe he should have done the same as Doug. If Luka can transition from a Douglike college roll to a hustle-first player with shooting and put back skills, hopefully he can also be a success story."
"Denzel Valentine was a player of the year and turned out trash, so I got why he wasn’t picked sooner"
Yeah he and Denzel Valentine are two guys who were incredible in college and I figured their abilities would translate over to the NBA easily and they’d be great. Oops lol
"Denzel Valentine, after his summer league performance me and my friends thought he was the next big wing."
"Bulls fan here. Almost all our guys we drafted post Jordan era showed flashes of stardom but ended up being sort of nothing:   Ben Gordon, Luol Deng, Tyrus Thomas, Taj Gibson,  Doug McDermott, Nikola Mirotic, Bobby Portis, Denzel Valentine, Lauri Markannen, Wendell Carter Jr.   No, I don’t count Derrick Rose. He won MVP, all star starter, blew out the big 3 Heat in the ECF in Game 1, and single handedly stopped the Linsanity."
I thought Denzel Valentine would come in and make some noise. Maybe not perineal all star level exactly but he’d be a solid 3/4 option. Idk where that dude even is anymore.
"Taurean prince, Denzel valentine, Markelle fultz, lauri markkanen, Dennis Smith Jr, marvin bagley, Kevin knox. That's my list of guys that were hyped but either have had bad injury luck or don't know what the hell is going on."
"No no. Trust me. Denzel Valentine is the funnier one.  There was some Twitter banter that described Denzel Valentine perfectly: ""He is the worst player in the league that thinks he is the best player in the league"".  He's not bad. Its just out of all the players in the league who think they are the best, he is the worst of them. Its a bit hyperbolic, but it describes his game so perfectly. He has so much confidence in himself.  I hope a team signs him. He is worth a minimum contract. He is a guy who can come in during the regular season while your team is banged up and give you some great (streaky) offensive minutes off the bench. He has the confidence to take a big 4th quarter shot.  He's still got some years ahead of him in the NBA."
"Announcers both killed this one, the ""oh my goodness Denzel Valentine"" vs ""no, no, no that's Steph Curry range"" dynamic between the play by play and color guys really make this clip hilarious."
"No one's put the context for this clip yet, and that's surprising, considering how much funnier it makes it. The box score you see onscreen is *deceptive* -- this game was NOT competitive. Miami was up 15 practically the entire time. Chicago couldn't get anything rolling, and it looked like it was due to Miami finally digging themselves out of the .500 COVID-inspired slump they'd been in. The whole 101-96 thing comes from a **ridiculous** 4th quarter behind Coby White and Vooch. It was beautiful; and this is coming from a Heat fan. It was this storybook 4th quarter, and I remember being insanely upset that Miami would choke a game as easy as this before Denzel Valentine pulled up and essentially inked a 10-second contract with the Miami Heat with that shot. It was **deflating**. It was glorious. It's a historical 30-footer.  edit: also, denzel valentine is an ELITE basketball name. not a great basketball player though"
Denzel Valentine? Is that you?
Lmao Denzel valentine catching strays
and it's not like he's like 22 (like denzel valentine and cristiano felicio were as jalen is still 19) or doing it on bad efficiency (like kevin knox was)
The 2016 summer league champions were led by Denzel Valentine and Cristiano Felicio.
"Oh great a place to post one of my hills I'll die on:  Denzel Valentine is one of the most mismanaged prospects of all time. Senior year Valentine was one of the most dominant college players I've ever seen. He had to play for two lame-duck coaches, especially when he first came in the league. Hoiberg let Butler (who didn't want to be there) and Wade (who didn't want to put the work in anymore) run the locker room and it was a joke.  They never made any attempt to let him do what he was good at. In college he was a high usage SG who played more like a PG, averaged 7.5 assists a game. Really efficient shooting from everywhere too. He would probe and use his great shot/decision making to run the offense. Reminds me of Lowry  As a rookie, his usage % coming off the bench was 15%. His three point attempt rate was over 70%. They didn't even let him touch the ball except to shoot threes.  The only season he ever got his usage above 20% Boylen was playing him at small forward (he's 6'4""). His  AST% never went above 18% (senior year of college it was above 45). They massacred my boy. Never forget: barring the Zion's and the Kyrie's of the world, every prospect needs a good situation. There are endless guys who would've been great if they were drafted one spot later/earlier"
If Dillon Brooks is evil Danny Green then Denzel Valentine is Danny Green at home
Denzel valentine was amazing in the summer league
Kevin Knox and Denzel valentine future MVPs
PG - Elfrid Payton  SG - Denzel Valentine  SF - Kelly Oubre Jr.  PF - Kyle Kuzma  C - Andre Drummond
"Denzel Valentine, Andre Drummond, Elfrid Payton, Jeff Teague, Kelly Oubre, Kyle Kuzma, Mario Hezonja, Dwayne Bacon, Caleb Martin, Hassan Whiteside"
"Yeah to put it in perspective the Bulls won that 2016 summer league with the key contributors being Denzel Valentine, Cristiano Felicio, and Jerian Grant. It should not be a surprise that they couldn't turn that into a real NBA championship."
Even after a whole summer league you’re playing yourself. Denzel Valentine looked like a starter in summer league.
The bulls won 2016 summer league championship with Denzel valentine and Felicio killing it lmao.....chill bro  Patrick Williams didn't play well and he was on the Olympic reserves and NBA starter.... summer league isn't going to tell you who is NBA ready from one game
Denzel Valentine
"Denzel Valentine is the worst player in the NBA that gets significant minutes. He is still a traffic cone on an rc car on defense, but I guess that's an upgrade from just being a traffic cone"
He overrated n going to be another Denzel valentine   Mark my words . I’ll take my downvotes
Denzel Valentine MVP
Denzel valentine was the GOAT
Denzel Valentine
Denzel Valentine would be proud
Fournier channeling his inner Denzel Valentine
Shades of Denzel Valentine
"Denzel Valentine, just thought of him with all the bulls signings. Hope they do him well"
It's not that uncommon for 4-year college stars. Denzel Valentine and Frank Kaminsky won player of the year in college.
"Lauri and Coby were terrible. We gave significant minutes to Denzel Valentine. All worse defenders then LaVine and Vooch. Lavine and Vooch are both average defenders. LaVine is not bad on defense anymore, watch games.  Vooch gets exposed on switches to the perimeter. Our guards didnt play defense, we overhauled our guard depth and now have 2 good to great defenders. Shores up Vooch's weaknesses.  There is 0 chance we are worse then last year."
"They also got Ball, a good defender, and Caruso, a great defender, to take minutes from Coby White, a terrible defender and ensure that Denzel Valentine, another awful defender, doesn’t play anymore"
"I remember he was supposed to be the instant offense guy out of his class with a great shot and big vert.   Don't actually know how he plays though, never watched. I just assume he is to the Hornets as Denzel Valentine is to the Bulls."
"Too bad our bench is Coby White, Caruso, Denzel Valentine, and Troy Brown lol"
"Bulls have some pretty good starters, but I have no idea who is going to play significant bench minutes outside of Coby, Caruso, and maybe Denzel Valentine. Need some bench bigs for this team desperately"
"Why did you guys give us gafford for TBJ just to lose theis in the off-season? We love gafford in DC like 10x more than we ever loved TBJ (personally, I think he’s Denzel valentine 2.0)"
"I'm not a Denzel fan at all but you do have a point...if anyone could actually maximize Valentine, it's Bud"
"I kinda wanna see if one of the good PGs gets stuck with no teams having money anymore and having to settle for our MLE for a year or something. If we sign someone before the market craters, I'd like someone like Denzel Valentine or Danny Green personally. Or putting pressure on the Lakers with Caruso."
"If we're patient enough, the market is going to dry out pretty quick here and we might be able to get a starting caliber player on the cheap. If we're not patient, I've been hoping for someone like Denzel Valentine personally; I think he'd be really good in Bud's system. Maybe Danny Green or something? Not sure. I'd imagine it'll be a point or wing. Would be really nice to have a good backup ball-handler but unless guys like Schroder have their market totally tank, the pickings for point guards are really slim."
His legacy lives within Denzel Valentine
Kosta Koufos and Denzel Valentine are brothers from different mothers. Truly transcendent.
"Lavine was still the Bulls best passer. Even when he’s double-teamed every night, and Denzel Valentine can’t make your assists, he still ended up with 5 assists a game."
"Denzel Valentine, Christiano Felicio and Tomas Satoranksky for the number 1 pick who says no?"
"Lol I was going to say this is the first time in a while I see Lonzo positivity from a Pels fan in a while. Most of the criticisms seem fair enough (I think he’ll improve though).   One thing I’ll give him though is I believe he’s more than a “decent” defender. He’s capable of being a very good defender but the Pels as a unit were just awful last season. Same with BI. Bulls kicked their ass twice, even Denzel Valentine looked like a good nba player in one of them. It’s hard to look good when your team defense is that awful."
"I went to MSU. I’ll just name a few.  Brynn Forbes(transfer from Cleveland state): championship w bucks  Denzel Valentine: chillin on the bulls roster I think lol  Gary Harris: solid player.  Draymond Green: I saw his penis once. Oh yeah, he’s won a championship or two or three  Miles Bridges: probably my favorite  Jaren Jackson jr: injured all the time but really good."
"Looks like I can't edit the post because it's past 40000 characters, so here's the Detroit team  \*\*point guard\*\*|\*\*shooting guard\*\*|\*\*small forward\*\*|\*\*power forward\*\*|\*\*center\*\*   :--|:--|:--|:--|:--   monte morris|devin booker|miles bridges|draymond green|javale mcgee   \*killian hayes\*|bryn forbes|josh jackson|kyle kuzma|xavier tillman sr.   edmond sumner|\*sviatoslav mykhailiuk\*|jae'sean tate|\*sekou doumbouya\*|\*aron baynes\*   mychal mulder|dakota mathias|denzel valentine| |    cassius winston|\*deividas sirvydis\*|brian bowen| | "

"r/nba siding with famous hard workers RJ Hunter, Jerian Grant, Denzel Valentine and Bobby Portis over Jimmy Butler and an undersized wing who had a top 20 career ever on half a knee."
"too many to count, but i’ll throw denzel valentine and mo bamba out there as pretty rough ones"
Changed to Denzel Valentine. For some reason I thought Hield's parents were Americans and he'd be eligible for Team USA.
ask us a year ago and we'd have plenty of answers like Denzel Valentine or Felicio but we've p much cleaned house I feel like
"He’s not that good haha, but he is 100% hustle - we brought in so many players we had to let go of a few. I mean if the Cavs are picking up Denzel Valentine then I think a team can pick up Ryan Arcidiacono. Although I wouldnt be surprised if he doesn’t get picked up , solid 10/11 man"
Denzel Valentine is also one
This team is much better than the 7-59 Bobcats... Edwards would carry this team to quite a few wins. I don't understand any of these comparisons.  rookie Kemba -&gt; Cole Anthony   Hendo -&gt; Dillon Brooks   Maggette -&gt; Markieff Morris   Diaw -&gt; Nic Batum (sorry too easy)   Biz -&gt; Biz (again... too easy)  DJ -&gt; Trey Burke   Higgins -&gt; whoever the worst SG in the NBA is right now   Reggie (holy shit I forgot he existed) -&gt; Denzel Valentine?   Mullens -&gt; tough one...  Kevin Love on nights when he really doesn't give a shit?   Diop -&gt; is Christiano Felicio still in the NBA?    Tyrus Thomas -&gt; Obi Toppin?    Matt Carroll -&gt; Steph Curry   Derrick Brown -&gt; Obi Toppin?   DJ White -&gt; pick a PF that's bad at everything and runs like he just shat his pants   Eddy Najera -&gt; Udonis Haslem
That would be Denzel Valentine not JR
"Just think that say, for example, the Cavs should have a guy like Jeremy Lin/Bismack Biyombo/John Henson to mentor either SexLand or Mobley/Markkanen/Allen instead of Denzel Valentine and Tacko Fall, you feel me?"
Kobe is definitely better than Denzel Valentine that’s for sure
Denzel Valentine is a porn star name
Spoken like a man who’s never been a fan of a team that has had Denzel Valentine.
"I know /s but I’d be so pissed if they trade Sexton for another guard lol. They have guards and bigs for days. Right now the wings are Cedi Osman, Isaac Okoro (I think he fits better as a guard, personally) and now Denzel Valentine. If they trade him, it needs to be for a wing."
Can you make me a positive Denzel Valentine moment in his Chicago career?
Anyone not named Denzel valentine.
They replaced Dameyan Dotson with Denzel Valentine. Both fringe NBAers who won't get many minutes. How does this not make sense?
You’re a Cavs fan who is ignoring the potential of guys like Mobley and Garland and Sexton and Okoro and flipping out over Denzel Valentine on a non guaranteed deal? No wonder the Cavs fandom is considered the second whiniest in the league after the Sixers.
‘It’s Denzel ValenTime’ -Denzel Valentine
Didn't we just let Denzel Valentine go?
"You would undoubtedly have seen that already imo if LaVine was in Utah in Mitchell’s place. Playing next to some legitimate NBA point guards (Rubio, Conley) and shooters over the years on a team with a perennial DPOY candidate center, I’m extremely confident that an alpha scorer as efficient as Zach would consistently have that team in the playoffs. I’m hesitant to say he would “lead” them to the playoffs because I’m hesitant to say Mitchell “leads” Utah to the playoffs. He’s undoubtedly their lead man offensively but Rudy Gobert is the guy who drastically raises the floor of the team and makes them as a playoff lock.   I’d like to see Donovan Mitchell lead Lauri Markkanen, Wendell Carter Jr, and Denzel Valentine to the playoffs."
"Not in Chicago anymore but Shaq Harrison was always good for a “how’d he do that?” Or “why’d he do that” moment…..now that I think about it Denzel Valentine was the same way, sadly Denzel was a little closer to rotation that bench than I would have liked"
There was also the Denzel Valentine game against the Heat. Possibly the most memorable moment of our season.
"People are underestimating how bad Lauri was on defense.  Also I am a Denzel Valentine fan, but our team should get better just by not having him play 17 minutes a game."
We also got rid of Lauri who was as bad or worse than Demar and moved Coby who is worse than Demar to the bench.  Don’t forget we also gave Denzel Valentine 17 minutes a game.
Best we can do is a S&amp;T with denzel valentine
"Bulls finished 12th in defense improving from 24th after the deadline with vuc, lavine, coby white, Denzel valentine, and tomas satoransky playing heavy minutes.  The defense won't be atrocious, especially when you consider coby white was one of the worst defensive players in the league last year according to raptor."
"The thing is Derozan is essentially replacing Lauri in the starting lineup (pwill covers the better forward player for both) and Lonzo replaces Coby (another bad defender.)  Derozan is very bad on defense i’m not denying that, but he is at least equal to Lauri.  I don’t expect our defense to get worse and we were at average last year.  Imo our defense actually got better with all our additions.  Don’t forget we had Denzel Valentine and Felicio getting minutes off the bench."
"GarPax Bulls EASILY from 2016 til they got canned last year…trading D Rose for Robin Lopez was heartbreaking man and then they brought in wade and rondo immediately after saying they wanted to get ‘younger’, the Felicio contract, Denzel Valentine….dark dark times"
"I know what you are trying to do, but if you use stats like this, it’s called cherry-picking your stats to fit the narrative you want. So first if you are going to look at who the better shooter is, you shouldn’t just look at playoff stats (which are a pretty small sample size - it takes like Steph ~25 games these days to shoot as many 3s as Larry Bird did in his entire playoff career).    But most importantly, take a look at the era.   Here are the leaders in 1986 by 3 pointers by attempt: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1986_totals.html (sort by 3PA). Larry Bird lead the NBA that year with 194 3PA.   That would place him 168th for the 2021 season: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_totals.html.   That’s right..he shot fewer 3s that year in his MVP year in 1986 than guys like Garrison Matthews, Solomon Hill, Denzel Valentine did last year, and last year was only 72 games too…  That’s because it’s like way easier today to shoot 3s with the spacing and rules than 35 years ago, and the offense is designed for players to shoot 3s. Take for example Draymond. As a Warriors fan, I can assure you almost every single 3 Draymond takes is wide-open, something Bird never had the luxury of."
"Absolutely incredible what they've done  It was obvious, I said it for years, that the ONLY thing holding the Bulls back from returning to absolute league-dominating glory, was Uncle Jerry, Paxson, and all of their disgustingly toxic, racist, fratboy cronies.  NO ONE (players, coaches, janitors...) wanted to work for those abusive slobs.  They were literally the most anti-player brass in NBA history  All it took was the old man aging out &amp; Michael taking over for the Bulls to get back on track for the first time in 22 freaking years.  Literally, immediately upon GarPax's termination &amp; the complete dismantling of their entire operation, the Bulls have signed premier free agents, one of the league's best coaches, &amp; begun finessing teams in trades  Mark these words:  Karnisovas is going to be the league's next great executive (along with Schlenk &amp; possibly the kid in Memphis).  What he did in Denver was brilliant, and now we're seeing what he's capable of with loads more freedom, a massively larger stage/platform, and a blank cheque book.  He &amp; Eversley are 200% locked in to bringing Chicago back to greatness.  GarPax would've maxed Markkannen, re-upped Denzel g0d@mn Valentine, called it a day &amp; headed to their yachts for the rest of the off-season.  Seriously, that's more or less precisely what the Bulls' off-season would've looked like under them LOL  See Red!  All Hail AKME!  The Madhouse On Madison is back in business!  That place is going to be live as sh!t this season..."
Is Denzel Valentine included in these “most nba players?”
We were mediocre last season… Trying to make the playoffs with Denzel Valentine getting minutes lol. That roster was a mess. We’re now a playoff lock and our Franchise player + young players will finally get to experience winning and grow through that.   We have to start somewhere. What do you expect? Just because we couldn’t sign Kawhi or KD we should’ve let a 26yo Lavine walk and start over?
Even Denzel Valentine rotational minutes didn’t disappoint you?
DENZEL VALENTINE!!!! If you are a Bulls fan you know exactly what I’m talking about.
Was ready to see a Denzel valentine moment
this reminds me of that denzel valentine shot with different results
Sleeper agent planted in Cleveland with Denzel Valentine. He'll gather intel from the bench lol
9-0 run? So surreal I’m still expecting to wake up and see Boylen coaching Denzel Valentine
I might be being a prisoner of the moment but since this happened I can’t get it out of my head lol[Denzel Valentine with the iconic heat check ](https://youtu.be/6oECxaUkKTg)
"Look back and you see Lauri, Wendell, Sato, Denzel Valentine, and Felicio. Look forward and you see Lonzo, DeRozan, Vuc, and Caruso. Take your pick."
Rakeem Christmas Jrue Holiday Denzel Valentine
Denzel Valentine  Heat are the whelps
"Collin Sexton, Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, Denzel Valentine, Jonathan Kuminga because lol"
Giannis Antetokounmpo and Denzel Valentine fused to create the perfect basketball player
is that a combination of Giannis Akumpo and Denzel Valentine?
Who he play for?  1. Derrick Favors 2. E'twaun Moore 3. Denzel Valentine 4. Rodney Mcgruder 5. Aaron Holiday
Denzel Valentine
Denzel mfing valentine
Denzel Valentine
My biggest takeaway is that Denzel Valentine is still in the league.
Denzel Valentine and Frank Kaminsky won player of the year in college
"Vuc has very good shot contest rate. He doesnt rack up blocks but is a Steven Adams level deterrent.   Williams and Ball are both situated perfectly. Ball/Caruso are statistically excellent point of attach defenders and Pat Williams looks like he can become a Robert Covington like forward who is versatile both on and off the ball on defense.    2 great defenders, 1 solid rim presence  and then you have your two you can hide--- just like every team has to hide someone or another.    DeRozan will be subbed for Caruso a lot, but its not much worse than any other team imo. We also had much worse players and athletes last year playing guys like Lauri and Denzel Valentine and Billy Donovan still ended up with a top 10 defense rating"
"Denzel Valentine was one of them, I can guarantee you that"
2016: Denzel Valentine to Juancho Hernangomez  2017: Lauri Markkanen to Frank Ntilikina  2018: Wendell Carter Jr to Collin Sexton  2019: Coby White to Jaxson Hayes  2020: Patrick Williams to Isaac Okoro.
"2016 papagiannis -&gt; Denzel Valentine  2017 fox, Justin Jackson, and Giles -&gt; Isaac, Patton, Terrance Ferguson  2020 Hali -&gt; Kira Lewis  2021 Davion -&gt; Ziaire  But somehow it’s all still worth it for 2018"
Last year it was denzel valentine
"So he can play with , Denzel Valentine and Kevin Knox in his starting 5"
"They should trade Luka for quality 3 and D wings to surround Boban with, someone like Denzel Valentine and Lamar Stevens."
Denzel Valentine
Denzel Valentine.
I thought Denzel valentine
"Oh yay time for me to post my favorite ref moment EVER which also includes the Bulls! Offensive Foul on Denzel Valentine, reviewed and upheld by none other than Tony Brothers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8p1KbbxeA"
"I swear that if after Mobley returns from injury and I have to watch Denzel Valentine take a single step onto the court except when we're up by 45 with a minute left, I will personally pack Bickerstaff's desk up for him"
"Garland , Mobley , Denzel Valentine"
If I have to watch one more second of Lamar Stevens and Denzel Valentine so help me god.
"No, I think who they want is Denzel Valentine"
"When you take into account all the other injuries/illnesses we will probably drop every one of those games. Dean Wade, Denzel Valentine, and Tacko Fall are getting extended, non garbage time minutes."
"Have tickets to the game and was lookin forward to seeing all these guys in person.  Denzel Valentine, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler just don’t hit the same.   Tacko getting 20 minutes should be fun I guess"
"stacey yelling NO, when Denzel Valentine chucks up a game losing three was so good last year 😂"
Just for fun I've thought about what Michgan State's team would be:  G: Bryn Forbes  G: Denzel Valentine  F: Miles Bridges  F: Draymond Green  C: Jaren Jackson Jr.
"we are missing 3 starters, not to mention mobley for the entire fourth quarter. we gave DEAN WADE AND DENZEL VALENTINE A COMBINED 57 MINUTES dude."
Denzel Valentine 21 minutes  Dean Wade 34 minutes  That's the summary.
how is Denzel valentine still in the league
Lmao we won a game with Denzel Valentine playing 23 minutes
Denzel Valentine is in...we will lose
90% sure that was Denzel Valentine
yeah i think he gets genuinely frustrated with the team sometimes which sometimes comes off as salt but it’s pretty entertaining.    Edit: The pure disdain in the Denzel Valentine shot last year was perfect.
"Or they could have gotten Dragan Bender or Denzel Valentine or Maquese Chriss and been exactly the same as they are now except with an extra bad season under their belt instead of some degree of success.  They’ve had chances to put proper teams around Dame and fucked it by handing out terrible contracts to bad players and using the firsts they did have poorly, an extra mid-late lottery pick isn’t going to save them from shit roster building."
"You obviously have not followed any Bulls basketball the last 5+ years. What GarPax did with this roster until they were fired was an abomination. Denzel fucking Valentine was a starter for this team, as were a large handful of other players you've probably never heard of that I won't bother naming, most of whom are now rightfully out of the league. Nobody could've taken this roster to the playoffs.   'Should've taken the Bulls to the 8th seed in the last 5 years.' That would be pretty tough since he's been there less than 4 seasons and had a torn ACL. If you actually follow basketball and can honestly say you 'have no respect for LaVine as a player' then you are somehow dumber than I already thought, Boomer. Basketball is clearly not your thing. Go back to farming karma on RPGs lmfao."
"The starters are gassed from playing 3 games in 4 days on top of being at the end of a road trip I would guess. But the issue is that the recency bias thing has nothing to do with pulling your starters with 6 minutes left down 12, and if it were true Bickerstaff was staying with the bench because they got us back in the game, then why did he put in Garland and for gods fucking sake why did he put in Denzel Valentine"
"He's not good. His value is in being a high energy guy. His skill set along with his size doesnt make him a fit on a good, deep NBA roster. Our wing depth is just that weak right now. Okoro is hurt, and a bit undersized when he is out there. Cedi Osman just got a DNP-CD in *favor* of Lamar Stevens, Denzel Valentine was our big wing free agent signing and he can't seem to crack our lineup, and Dylan Windler is a total question mark who's just getting back from his third injury stint in as many years.   Were not starting Markkanen just to be quirky. It's a necessity thing too."
Denzel Valentine
