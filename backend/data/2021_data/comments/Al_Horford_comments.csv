"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"
Al horford
"Mike Conley. People forget this man was part of the Grizzlies roster alongside Marc Gasol that made the WCF. Plus he had to play against Steph, Dame, Russ, Harden (when he played PG), pre-Lakers Steve Nash, Chris Paul, and many more. Never had a shot of making the All-Star team, until this year. I would say his name and Donovan Mitchell's name (but I had to do only 1 Jazz player) at the top even if I wasn't a Jazz fan.  Honorable mentions: Dame, Giannis, Al Horford, and Paul Millsap."
We still doing this? Even while he's averaging 1 point more than Al Horford.
"Gordon's retaliation appeared to be brought on by Lowry's boxout that got him in the knee/inner thigh a couple minutes earlier.  I'm sure it was heavily compounded by the earlier incident, but that was the trigger point.  I'm just tired of seeing comments like ""Lowry is a dirty player who tries to hurt people"" because it's absolutely ridiculous.  This sub has hated Lowry for years (from the ""trash bros"" days, even though he had literally one bad playoff series with the Raptors, and that's it) and calling him out for flopping (half-true, he does draw a lot of charges but he definitely sells contact), and now the narrative is that he's dirty.    Does he play on the edge?  Absolutely.  Was it a stupid foul on Gordon?  Absolutely.  But Al Horford put TJ Ford in the hospital and nearly paralyzed him with a stupid foul, and nobody has ever called him dirty.  Mistakes happen."
"Woah Ken, I never said I did it. Here‚Äôs a story; I sat next to this 70 something yr old white dude a few years ago at a Hawks game. He was a cool dude, apparently he was a long time regular. Had a special jacket gifted to him from the franchise with a bunch of badges &amp; autographs on it from over the years, Al Horford knew him by first name. He was talkin‚Äô shit to John Wall cuz he flopped. He said something along the lines ‚Äústop fuckin floppin John!‚Äù John made eye contact with him and followed with a huge grin. Just saying, some NBA players think they‚Äôre better than the fans and have a shit attitude, kinda like you."

"It's funny every time you say anything here about Gordon's hit being cheap or dangerous, in come the whataboutism police yelling ""Well What about Kyle in the bubble!?!""  &gt;Either judge both Gordon and Lowry on potential worst-case injury that their foul could have caused  I'm pretty sure we did that for Lowry...months ago, when it happened in the bubble. Gordon's happened yesterday, which is why we're talking about it. Am I not allowed to speak on AGs hit because Kyle fouled him months ago?   Kyle makes reckless plays at the rim to try and stop dunks. He did the same to Donte last week. I'm glad you brought up TJ/Horford because it actually reminds me of young Horford. He wasn't a dirty player at all, but was just sometimes reckless. I remember Al doing that to another Raptor player again after the TJ Ford injury.   That still doesn't change the fact Gordon's hit was pretty dangerous itself and probably warranted a flagrant 2. It wasn't a basketball play and had excessive intentional contact. The original poster called it ""safe"" which is why I responded, as it obviously wasn't."
"If they get Derrick Rose, Al Horford,  and Paul Millsap they can have a big 8"
And still less than Al Horford
OKC boys how is Al Horford doing after a quarter of a season? Like legit takes.
On Al horford too...jheeez that‚Äôs a tough great move. He wanted horford to make eye contact with him so bad lmaoooo
"No team is ever stuck with anyone. Philly somehow traded Al Horford. Whatever I thought I knew about trading is wrong. Anyone can be moved, no matter the contract amount, or length of time. 34 year old Al Horford was 1 year into his 100+ million dollar contract, and he was moved for a 2nd round pick and I think it was a top 5 protected 1st. Where there's a will, there's a way. With that said, I don't know if GS is looking to move him or not, but if they aren't, they should be."
They need to trade for Al Horford somehow.
why does the coach look like al horford?
"Danny Green's foul on Klay Thompson put him out for a year and it wasn't remotely dirty.  TJ Ford's career was nearly ended twice by non-dirty fouls (Mark Madsen and Al Horford).  What Lowry did was reckless, but the hate boner this sub has for him is absolutely ridiculous."
"Brett Brown in a nutshell lmao, out of position and next to Al Horford and JRich which just swallowed up all of our non-existant spacing next to Ben and Embiid"
"they are 98m with Al Horford, without him 71m, but they would have Danny G for 15m, TFerg and Poirer for 7m, so they would have in 91m."
Its because Embiid is net positive with damn near anybody. He was fucking positive with Al Horford last year.
"now put al horford, james ennis, and josh richardson in there"
Based on more than half the teams having a center who is clearly better defensively...  1) Nikola Jokiƒá - Denver Nuggets  2) Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers  3) Rudy Gobert - Utah Jazz  4) Jusuf Nurkic - Portland Trail Blazers  5) Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá - Orlando Magic  6) DeAndre Ayton - Phoenix Suns  7) Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas - Memphis Grizzlies  8) Steven Adams - New Orleans Pelicans  9) Myles Turner - Indiana Pacers  10) Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks  11) Jarrett Allen - Cleveland Cavaliers  12) Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks  13) Karl Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves  14) Al Horford - Oklahoma City Thunder  15) Tristan Thompson - Boston Celtics
He got possessed by Al Horford
Al Horford to the Hornets.
Yes! Al Horford at Center.  Rest of the team:  Russ  Kd  Harden  Melo (PG13?)
"Dude I'm done with you after you called fucking Jabari Parker a defensive Stalwart. Travis only signed players on EXPIRING CONTRACTS, that wouldn't eat at our cap space or require us to cut any of our young core. You expected him to do something stupid like signing Al Horford to a 4 year extension and letting Reddish walk because he had a rough rookie year? They cannot run a offense with Trae and Collins, you have to be a moron or a manchild laughing to himself over this weak troll attempt. What has Luka accomplished other than losing out of the first round? We're handing out participation trophies, I can gloat how Luka's team is 11th place and most likely gonna miss the playoffs if they don't make a trade soon while Trae's is in 6 and only has the Cavs, Magic, Heat, and Knicks to worry about. Gallo been more productive than a 7'3 big that gets murked by Cousins."
"I will defend Kyrie more than alot of people on this sub, but the most games Kyrie has ever won without another All-Star teammate is 49 and he did that with former All-Stars in Al Horford and Gordon Hayward and a young stud like Tatum who would be an All-Star the very next season.  Outside of that, Kyrie won 21, 27 and 33 games without another All-Star in his first three years in Cleveland and last year was 8-12 as a starter with Brooklyn before he got hurt.  Dame has been over .500 and made a WCF without an All-Star teammate, but i think we can all agree that CJ is a player that is as close as you can get to being an All-Star without actually being one.  Steph is better than all these guys and we have LITERALLY ZERO EVIDENCE (outside of his first three years when he was injured) that he can't lead a mediocre squad to a bunch of wins. People that doubted Steph in this sub are actually clueless."
Al horford. Such a boring game but he always dices my Knicks up
"Lmao you really think we're gonna lose to that heat team? Its alright, yall forgot we had Al Horford last season, you'll see. Butler cant shoot 3s"
Somewhere al horford does a single clap as he jogs back up the floor.
They should trade for an All star big. I think Al Horford would be a good fit on their roster.
"Lol nothing to figure out this season, I think. Losing Al Horford and Hayward really hurt our chances in the short term. Kemba wasn't the answer. We just needed someone to facilitate the ball to JB, Tatum, Hayward and Horford, and instead we went out and signed Kyrie-lite. Even though Kemba is a much better teammate and not toxic, at least."
"Yup. Gordon Hayward and AL Horford soured on the franchise and left because of Kyrie too, and not for no reason. Kyrie is just toxic."
Joking was guarded by Zubac and Harrell lol. Why we acting like he dominated Joel Embiid or Rudy Gobert? Al Horford is so much better than Zubac.
"He was the best player on our team in their 2016 run before KD left. Russ was one of the best players in the playoffs that year except LeBron and curry. If KD came back in 2017, I think we would've won. We would've had more depth, possibly al Horford, a good backup ball handler in oladipo, and the rest of the team that took the 73-9 warriors to 7 games. Just a shame KD didn't wanna try"
"KG isn‚Äôt prototypical IMHO, he was a 7 foot SF that shifted to PF.  He‚Äôs in that hybrid section.  He just slowed down later in his career and went to a PF/C.   Blake Griffin is prototypical, as is Duncan, Stoudamire, Pau Gasol....  Guys who can both play high and low and rebound.  Al Horford might actually be one."
"Oh, the soccer community here knows it. Hockey is alittle different where they‚Äôre kind of a decent mix of high schools, travel teams, and pro youth development systems. But it‚Äôs fun to see it creep into basketball. [Sabonis, Al Horford, the Curry‚Äôs, Klay, Kobe, Austin Rivers, Wesley Mathews, Devin Booker (etc)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_second-generation_National_Basketball_Association_players) are all legacy kids with more on the way like a Bronny Jr. Hell, most 2nd round picks get cut or sent to the G-League never to see the light of day while Giannis‚Äôs brothers were signed to roster spots as Giannis leverage. Wealth will soon dominate American basketball talent"
"Al Horford has improved as a shooter, he was never a 3 point scorer but has improved his range!!"
Al Horford prime where he becomes a Sharpshooter
The Moose (Mike Muscala)  The Whore (Al Horford  Pokumon (Pokusevski)
Casuals prolly won‚Äôt see it but there‚Äôs a lot of Al Horford in his game ... you can tell quickly studied a lot of horfords old hawks and Florida film

Y'all think we could just leave DJ and take Al Horford with us? I feel like he'd fit in pretty well with the nets.   How's his D?
"I still didn't get that. We traded shamet, the phoenix pick and scraps for tobi. The contract is its own thing. But we did get tobi on our team for what amounts to nothing. Shamet wasn't going to be Tobi and we went over the cap to sign tobi anyway. The real blunder was Al Horford."
"Popularity has literally nothing to do with allstar appearances when it comes to the bench. If popularity was taken into account by the coaches, then guys like Al Horford and Paul Millsap would not be multiple time allstars."
Westbrook for Al Horford and George Hill.
Reminds me of when jr Smith pushed al horford in the air back in the 2017-2018 playoffs. Dirty shit that has no place in the game. Bron deserves a suspension.
He starting where Al Horford was so no its not at all frustrating. Everytime Embiid doesn't get doubled I smile.
We seriously can't stress enough that we were playing with a starting line up with Simmons - Harris - Al Horford and Embiid.  Under the premise tall = good.
"Disclaimer that this is not an excuse and this lineup 100% blew a 23 point lead against Detroit.  **Starters:**  PG: CP3  SG: Book  SF: Mikal  PF: Crowder  C: Ayton  **Bench:**  PG: Cam Payne  SG: Jevon Carter  SF: Langston Galloway for first 10 games, Abdel Nader after  PF: Cam Johnson  C: Dario Saric  Book, Saric, Payne have been battling injuries or covid. Payne turned his ankle (i think in the houston game), came back, and hasn't really been since; he was on fire to start the season. Saric was in almost all of our most productive lineups, and the dropoff from him to kaminsky is steep. But kaminsky is simply better than Damian Jones who by all means should not be on a roster.   Cam Johnson was 9 of 35 from 3 coming into this game over the last 5 games, where he took over for Jae Crowder in the starting lineup but probably shouldn't have? Idk, the starters were really, really bad, and it was apparent in the Wizards game.  The suns hot start was due to insanely hot bench production. Mikal, Cam Payne and Cam Johnson would take us on massive runs and the starters would allow teams to come back into it, but in the Jazz and Denver games (first ones), our lead was too big to blow or we somehow clutched it out with book / cp3 isos. Those isos have not been working in the more recent clutch games. Vs. Memphis, Houston, and Denver twice, Ayton played amazingly, and when we need him to be dominant against an aging Al Horford, he gives us 5 points on 6 shots and a bunch of soft baby hooks screaming of indecision.  Surely, the starters' lack of production cannot be THIS poor for so long. For a group of high-contributing basketball players, ***playing this bad is IMPOSSIBLY UNSUSTAINABLE.***   But if there's a team that can do the impossibly negative, it's the Phoenix Suns.  I thoroughly expect the Warriors to shove their fist up their asses tomorrow."
Al Horford imo
"He was good down the stretch for the team and did Al Horford shit. I think Al‚Äôs presence is so good for this team. Plays hard and smart. Obviously he‚Äôs not a part of the long term, but why not show guys like Shai and Dort  what winning basketball looks like."
Yeah let‚Äôs see you play against Al Horford after going toe to toe with Joker in a close games.
"Ok Takeaways:  OKC YESSIRSKI ‚úÖ WE DO NOT LOSE FOLKS DONT FUCKING FORGET IT  That was like watching last years team scrimmage at 100% and CP3 is so good he has the play against all the young guys and Al horford for it to be fair  Abdel Nader - the return, the revenge  Jae crowder is so solid bro  Dort is actually so fucking good pay attention to the man  me telling the refs to T up Chris paul   Poku got some nice run. This is how we make him into the 7 foot sniper guard he will inevitably become ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  Diallo is waaaay too tough  Flacko Roby SZN  CP3 is probably so furious rn hahaha  Awesome Shai  Good work OKC. Let‚Äôs keep competing"
Al Horford and Robin Lopez are great at this as well.
Al Horford with that new daddy juice.
It's not so much I disliked the guy... but I could never really buy into Al Horford for the brief time he was with us. It kind of just felt like he was there for the money.
"Underrated: John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMarcus Cousins, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Paul Millsap, Al Horford and Derrick Rose, especially if they missed out on pre-injury Rose  Russell Westbrook is so polarizing that he will remain stuck on a pendulum.  While I generally like Kyrie Irving, I think he has been and will remain overrated, despite being a very good player.   He's flashy and efficient, which works to his benefit, along with his undeniably, spectacular peformance in the 2016 Finals. As a star player though, he's produced a very little amount of sustained team success as a leader, away from three surefire Hall of Famers, one of which is considered the GOAT for a whole generation of fans (and, all three are among the greatest scorers/offensive talents the league has ever seen).  That's not really Kyrie's fault, but I don't think people in the future who didn't see will consider that aspect all that much."
Those hawks teams overachieved so hard. Our best player was al horford and we won 60 games.
Hmm I normally would agree but not really feeling Kyrie and harden together on the floor.   And what buyout guys will be big time tho? Al horford? If they lucky whiteside
"Such a good point. His agent‚Äôs name is Jason Glushon and the list of other players he represents or once did is interesting - Joe Johnson, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, and Jaylen Brown are his 4 big contracts all over $100 mil. He also represents Dinwiddie who just signed that $32 mil Bitcoin contract. All his other clients look to be vet min guys but hard to believe he never got Jeff Green paid more."
Yeah bro are you seriously talking shit about that playoff series? No Simmons and fucking Al Horford?
"Our offense wont be the same lmao, are you even watching us? Embiid looks way better and he was already a top 10 player. Then we replaced Al Horford and J Rich with Danny Green, Seth Curry and Dwight. We're  a way better team."
"He's always been this good, he's just in better shape now and not having to play next to Al Horford."
"The thing is Jokic isn't some kind of new era center *on defense.* He's not good at switching or guarding the 3pt line. You're talking about him like he's Al Horford - a nominal center who wasn't great as a rim protector but was excellent switching against smaller players. Denver wants to drop Jokic back in drop coverage, but that means he has to be a rim protector. And that sometimes gets him into trouble. So they often bring him up to the level of the screen, making switching more likely. Like, what part of defense do you think Jokic is good at? For the record, I think he can be passable, but he can also be exploitable."
Al horford is not a good rim protector but the Celtics back then were very good defensively.

"I might be wrong, but I don't believe CBA allows teams to extend a player during the season. There are certain deadlines.  Secondly, NBA owners run a business. Just because Lakers have 30x more endorsements and multi-billion dollar local TV deal (on top of national tv), it doesn't mean that every market can replicate that. [Dan Gilbert lost $40M despite winning a championship](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/01/27/how-lebrons-cavaliers-lost-an-nba-high-40-million-last-season/?sh=1ea3eed37699). It's not about being cheap, it's about running a sustainable business. Sarver paid luxury tax from 2008 to 2010. That's a fact! He sold Rondo because Suns were trying to win a championship, and D'Antoni didn't want a rookie - he was never known for developing young players. Kurt Thomas was due $8M in 2008 and at the time that he was already over the hill. If Suns kept him, they would have paid $16M due to luxury tax. Back then that was more like paying $30M for Al Horford."
"PHI is high on my list because of Morey. I worry about long-term future because it seems they really want to compete (see: Tobias Harris trade/resigning, Al Horford signing), but their future is pretty bright."
Al Horford? Lol
"Horford seems to be like the Duncan type of leader of leading by example, except Duncan is literally 50x better. Duncan was the good cop type of leader of the spurs, Pop was the bad cop. With Jordan and Pip, Jordan was the bad cop, Pippen was the good cop. In Boston, there seemed to be Al as the good cop, 3 bad cops, and 1 weird cop. In Philly, Al seemed to be perfect as the backup 5, but for that amount of money tho?"
Horford would actually be great for them but I don't know if they have the salary for it. Is Al still decent? He was alright for us just a terrible fit.
Al Horford wasn‚Äôt on the team just fyi
They have any more picks? We have Al Horford and Trevor Ariza.
Crazy how good this man is when he doesn‚Äôt have to play next to Al Horford
I mean i know that he wasnt as good as Ewing but he sure was better than a player like Al Horford
Mourning was a solid player like an Al Horford. Not someone you call an all time great but would make a few all star games
"I thought at the least he could generate offense similar to Al Horford, be the man setting screen for Pick n pop, post up sometime, run some dribble hand off action. But damn it‚Äôs sad"
"Ok fair enough but I don‚Äôt think it was about political correctness. Jarrett Allen was effusive in his support of Kyrie.  If he felt differently he could‚Äôve sidestepped it.  If KD is displeased, we  see it, like with Dray or Westbrook.  For all the locker room cancer talk, even all his former Celtics teammates all praised him except al Horford.  Jayson Tatum always talks about his love for Kyrie."
"oh nope, Im sorry, I forgot about Al Horford but he's inactive."
Al Horford is away from the team for the birth of his kid. He‚Äôs normally the starting center.
"Give Steph, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, and Terry Rozier and I guarantee he doesn't flame out in the second round all the while talking about he should've shot more, when he's like 2 for fucking 17. Kyrie hasn't done shit without having a top three player on his team."
"I remember a series like this: [2011 Hawks vs Magic.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2011-nba-eastern-conference-first-round-hawks-vs-magic.html) Dwight did whatever he wanted inside, but it didn't matter, the Magic were still defeated in 6. And that was a Hawks team with Joe Johnson, Al Horford, and Josh Smith, not KD, Kyrie, and Harden.  Although to be fair, if Dwight had averaged the magical ""28 and 15"" instead of just 27 and 15.5, they would have won FOR SURE."
"lol wut? coming from a philly fan? seriously, you guys are 2 years removed from maxing Al Horford and trading him with a 1st round pick for nothing get the fuck outta here."
"Sixers just traded Al Horford and a garbage 2025 first for Danny green, but sure nobody wants late draft picks."
"I think the problem with Allen is, he's due a fat contract that makes it so he is the third piece.  No wiggle room.  As it is, when Walker's contract expires, the Celtics will have a shot at a free agent to pair with Brown and Tatum before they get 30% max contracts.  That would literally be the last chance to add any free agent to Brown and Tatum in their primes.  If they had to re-sign Allen (sunk cost and all of giving up picks), his salary would remove any cap space before Brown and Tatum get paid.  &amp;#x200B;  Personally, I don't think Allen is all that great to be the third best player on a championship team.  And Boston is attractive enough that they could risk it and hope for free agency.  A Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Kemba Walker tier player is much better than Jarrett Allen.  I might be wrong, but I don't see Allen ever being as good as third options on recent championship teams (Lowry, Klay, Love)"
ah the ol Al Horford
"Number 1 worst is Al Horford, and it's not close. Pascal Siakam and Wiggins are also worse contracts. Kemba is still an all-star level guard"
George Hill and Al Horford
acting like Philly fans weren't even worse to Al Horford and his family lmao
Damn this is a perfect Al Horford trade that they might not be able to do
Al Horford.
Damn this is a perfect Al Horford trade when we used to have him LMAO.
"Not trying to be rude, but that trade is utter shit for Brooklyn. Al Horford at best is a non-entity in a trade, and at worst is a negative value asset with his age and contract. That being the case, that would end up being basically a George Hill swap for Kyrie. I love what Hill did for us as a player, but there's no rational universe in which that's a good trade at all. OKC would need to attach at least 3 first rounders of some sort to make that an even trade, even with Kyrie going AWOL. Also doesn't really make sense for OKC either because they aren't looking to move draft capital for vets in their prime. Trade would need a third team minimum to make it make sense for those two teams."
Al Horford and George Hill for Kyrie? I dunno Ive been on trade machines for too long
"Based on the early returns from this season, it doesn't appear that was a blip. In the¬†[Milwaukee Bucks](teamlink://347)' win over the¬†[Dallas Mavericks](teamlink://338)¬†on Friday night, Giannis went 1-of-10 from the line, which was lnot only the worst free throw night of his career, but one of the worst ever.¬†  Only three other players in NBA history had ever shot less than 10 percent from the line in a game with a minimum of 10 attempts: Shaquille O'Neal,¬†Andre Drummond¬†and¬†Al Horford. As a result, Giannis is now shooting a career-low 57.5 percent from the foul line this season, and he and the Bucks appear to have a major issue on their hands.¬†  Holy shit"
Didn't even know Al Horford was on the Thunder til now lol
"Simmions is 24. They build around Simmions, Deni, Rui, Bertans, Thomas Bryant. Their lottery pick cause they are gonna be bad. Trade Russell Westbrook to OKC for Al Horford?"
"they shouldn't have gotten Adams in the first place, Myles Turner and Al Horford were both available and both fit better next to Zion."
"The harsh truth is you realize how bleak the future of your team is, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre on Reddit turning red in the face when someone points it out. The raptors are the new Al Horford Atlanta Hawks, solid regular season team that doesn‚Äôt do anything but become a nut rag for teams like the Celtics, Bucks, Nets, 76ers and Heat to advance in the playoffs.   The raptors are a poverty franchise, the elite franchises laugh at you. Sorry man."
"This year is exactly why he didn‚Äôt re-sign. The raptors are the new Al Horford Atlanta Hawks, and the Clippers are one of the best teams in the league.  Why do people keep trying to push this narrative?"
Steph + Al Horford  Al was so good in his prime.
"Bynum was behind Dwight in thr very early 2010's for like a year. I would say Pau is a PF during his laker days. Hibbert at his peak was top 3 Imo, then he fell off a cliff. Chandler was just a double double defensive anchor, at his peak a top 5 center at most. Now that I think about it al Jefferson and AL horford was probably better than Tyson."

Looking like Al Horford watching a free throw hit the rim
"Al Horford, George Hill and Trevor Ariza ^please"

"Hell no wtf, OKC should be giving the spurs picks in this trade. You realise LMA and Trey are both expiring contracts and Al Horford is on one of the worst contracts in the league? And even if OKC was to give a first round I dont think I'd do it because the spurs would lose the max slot they've opened up for free agency."
"Plumlee never started next to Jokic in ANY of the matchups the two have played. And oh, interesting... last year was the year Al Horford was in Philly and he started both games... Hmmmm. He's a 5 at this stage in his career and he I am sure got his share of minutes against Jokic.   Try again, to provide some evidence instead of childish trolling next time else I can only conclude that you are a thicker than a couple phonebooks stacked atop each other and equally as useless."
Somehow it will be Al Horford
Al Horford
&gt;Seth is a good addition. Daryl deserves major props for that. He also deserves credit for Dwight and flipping Al Horford  That's what you're missing
"Just went back to check. The starting five of the 2008 Rookie Team was composed of Al Horford (21), Kevin Durant (19), Jeff Green (21), Mike Conley (20), and Luis Scola (27 years young) lol"
"Officiating is the reason that I struggle to watch the NBA casually. In college basketball I can usually get a feel of how the refs call a game and I'll know what they'll likely call and what they'll likely let go. In the NBA it seems much more dependant on the player and situation and fans. And then there's stuff like this, which happened IN A PLAYOFF GAME  https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2018/04/25/bucks-joe-prunty-still-upset-whistle-didnt-blow-al-horford/547994002/  Note - it may not be all the refs fault. Player attitudes and rules themselves could help the situation. At the end of the day, though, it can sometimes lead to terrible product on the floor."
Al Horford exists
al horford cookin this year
Would you let fans in to see al horford and george hill as your second and third best players?
Al horford who thinks he is a pf plus embid.  I don't think draymond would work well with Ben simmons....  On offense.
Al horford
Al Horford
Al Horford.
I think Embiid‚Äôs best defender for a while was Al Horford before he came to the Sixers
"*Trae Young hits a 3*  ""And Westbrook hits the 3""  ""Now they're saying it was Al Horford"""
That‚Äôs a really underrated signing tbh. Before him and Al Horford the sixers had the worlds worst backup Cs so Embiid had to play basically 48 minutes a game if the sixers wanted to win in the playoffs.
"We must view basketball through much different lenses then. Some examples of bigs that I believe guard switches well are Gobert, Bam, Jarrett Allen, Al Horford, DeAndre Ayton."
"Yeah he's been the leader (or one of the leaders) in 3PT assists for the past few years. I believe he was the leader last year while passing to Al Horford, Josh Richardson and Tobias Harris."
Yo you can probably get Al Horford from the Thunder. Will cost you a 1st rounder due to the Presti tax.
Al Horford is better than Dwight Howard lol
Kyrie Irving   Jaylen Brown   Jayson Tatum  Gordon Hayward  Al Horford
"I would be selling.  Specifically, I'd consider selling cap flexibility along with the vets. I don't think there's going to be any good deals to be had at the top of free agency this summer, and most of the better players either don't fit the timeline or are restricted.  We're also too good to get a high pick that would lead to a franchise-altering player...and I don't think we have a #1 guy on this roster.  So if somebody wants to move off of ""bad"" long-term money in an Al Horford sort of way in exchange for one of our expiring vets? I'm in, even without much compensation for doing so.  For instance, this team with Horford instead of Aldridge would be *significantly* better, and I feel like that move would have been available this summer."
"Ironically, Al Horford would be a perfect fit for the Celtics now"
OKC's Al Horford?
"All of us defend the process. It got us Joel and Simmons, 2 all-stars and a great foundation. What we all are generally critical is what came after when Bryan Coangelo tried to singlehandedly sink the entire franchise with bad move after bad move.   From 2016-20, our front office was a mess. We fucked up the fultz pick, we chose Brett Brown over Jimmy Butler, the Tobias max contract was highly questionable, and the Al Horford decision was one of the worst moves we've ever seen."
He‚Äôs talking about all the times he tried to extend Al Horford
Passing   one of the biggest myths is the idea of the ‚Äúfloor spacing 5‚Äù you can count on one hand the number of 5s that are actual floor spacers. These al horford Myles Turner types nobody guards them regardless of whatever their percentages are nobody cares. They don‚Äôt provide floor spacing. It just doesn‚Äôt matter people conceptualize it as way way more valuable than it actually is   Legit playmaking from a big opens up a lot in terms of how you can run your offense

"See that's also an oversimplification.   Yes, ideally Tatum needs to be more efficient. I'm not going to argue there.    However, the mistake you're making is assuming players should be compared to league averages and not team averages. I would love for Tatum to defer his shots to LeBron James more frequently, but unfortunately, we don't have LeBron James on the team.   Tatum often can't pass out of a bad shot because if he passes out we get an even worse shot. He can't defer to Jeff Teague, Semi Ojeleye and Grant Williams.   Kyrie on the other hand, had: Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier. There were guys he could have deferred to. Instead, he took shots away from them to focus on his own volume stats.  There is an argument to be said that Tatum could offload a couple of extra scoring attempts (and I've been wary of his low assist numbers and poor body language lately), but we really need him scoring ~20-25ppg at least, even at this efficiency because we can't get those points in a more efficient way.   &gt;Does that mean you'd rather have Deandre Jordan as a scorer than Tatum?  No.   Because as much as Tatum has struggled recently:  1. His efficiency isn't bad for a perimeter player (TS% is warped by highly efficient bigs on low volume) 2. His efficiency needs to be seen in the context of the team, not the league."
"Your take is ridiculous when you look at his coaching history.   He coached a starting lineup of Rookie Smart, Avery Bradley, Evan Turner, Brandon Bass and Tyler Zeller to 40 wins.   The next year was IT, AB Crowder, Sullinger and Amir. Three of those guys aren't even in the NBA anymore. That team won 48 games.   They won 53 and the ECF the next season by replacing Sullinger with Horford.   Then they went to the conference finals with Rookie Tatum, 2nd year Brown, Scary Terry, Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Marcus Smart. And they were minutes from the finals. They went through Giannis/Middleton and Embiid/Simmons."
... Al Horford is on the Thunder now?? That feels so random
"You're making my point for me. Imagine a conference where Jeff Teague, Al Horford, Demar, Lowry are making all star teams and leading top teams. Hahahahaha!!!!  And Rose was one of the most controversial MVPs ever. Most didn't think he deserved it and even then he had no one to help him offensively going up against prime Lebron, Wade and Bosh"
TIL Al Horford is playing for the Thunder.
"&gt;20yo Rose  Who just won MVP on a team with the best record that year  &gt;Al Horford, Jeff Teague  Who were all stars and led their team to the best record in the East  &gt;Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry  Again, best record in the East and both All Stars.  Fortunately you don't win a championship by being the best team in your conference, you win it by beating the best team in the other conference which Lebron did 3 times in the East.   You are a grade A nonce"
"Coming out of an all-time bad conference and teaming up with 2 other all stars when 80% of the top players in the league were in the West  Very impressive going through the corpses of KG/Pierce/Ray, 20yo Rose, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry, Marcus Morris, 5'6 Isaiah Thomas, 5'7 Kemba Walker, teenage Jayson Tatum etc. Most these guys can't even make AS teams in the West (Isaiah, Demar, Lowry, Millsap, Horford, even PG was an injury replacement his first year etc). And these guys were his main competition in the shitty ass Least hahahaha. And he had Wade/Bosh or Kyrie/Love on his team  The best player Lebron saw in the East for his finals streak was Paul George LMFAO. And we see what Playoff P truly is in a real conference the past 3 seasons. Upset as the favorite 3 straight years, getting sonned by Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum and Gary Harris."
Made me happy to see Ol‚Äô Al Horford so excited about the W
Trade for Al Horford.
"Coach D said after the game that the play was drawn up to be a two-man game with Shai and Horford, but Horford adjusted after the ball was inbounded. That‚Äôs basically code for ‚ÄúPoeltl fucked up, so Al took advantage.‚Äù"
Al Horford
He took Al Horford and the rookie deal crew to game 7 of the ECF against LeBron
Would you be interested in Al Horford? I think he‚Äôd be an excellent fit
Maybe you‚Äôre interested in Al Horford who‚Äôs shooting 38% from three on decent volume? ;)
You thought al horford was better than him 2 years ago I got the receipts
He just had an Al Horford game 2 days ago in a loss to the Hawks.
horford has had the ‚Äúaverage al‚Äù brand stuck on him and casual fans that don‚Äôt watch him just go with it
"I think horford gives you better options than gobert personally. I‚Äôm not gonna flame you for choosing gobert, but horford‚Äôs passing and PNR game with a skilled guard are really underrated. He is also a very good defensive big, obviously not gobert level though, so I guess it depends what you want from your 5. I like how good Al was at distribution and when he developed a 3-shot, it created some amazing spacing.  EDIT: like 3-4 years ago obviously, I‚Äôd take gobert today over horford today."
"True Al Horford was a spot up shooter for the sixers last year, that had more to do with the horrible spacing on the team, but it just isn‚Äôt what horfords strengths are"
"To me, not having Thabo for defense was a huge killer for them.  Also, I don‚Äôt hate on that Hawks roster. I love me some Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver (fuck Delly), and Al Horford (though I really hate Jeff Teague)."
"Al Horford is a ""who he play for?"" guy in 2021."
"Yet he has/had his career highs against Utah, Philly, Phoenix, and Boston, all teams with trash big men like Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid (2x), Deandre Ayton, Al Horford"
Al Horford + Moses Brown for Zinger and a 2026 top-3 protected FRP.  Take it!
Horford is nearly washed. Why would the Mavs *ever* want Big Al?
Has regressed defensively big time this year and would be almost unplayable in the playoffs.  No idea if the money would work but KP.   If I was Dallas I‚Äôd be considering trading him for Al Horford
"They bragged about beating us when we didn't have SGA, Al Horford, George Hill and an 8 man roster lol."
"Oh damn, I looked at the wrong thing and thought I saw Rose on a cheaper contract. I messed up there. That's still cheapish in today's NBA, but I thought read he was on a lesser salary. That's my mistake.  I will say, not being stuck with Kemba's contract would have opened the door for a little more flexibility. We ended up with Tristan Thompson and Enes Kanter with our last MLEs. I would have preferred just upping Timelord's minutes over them 2. People always say players can't be traded such as Al Horford last year, but there's always a way to make something happen. This just sounds like more reason for me to not like our FO, because this screams mismanaged cap along with underwhelming roster construction."
&gt;much more to do with the front office than the player  I mean OKC has always surrounded him with talent good enough to win no ?  The 2016 would‚Äôve been bolstered by Al Horford joining them had he stayed. OKC built competitive teams year in year out. It‚Äôs not like he was in fucking Minny.
"I‚Äôm not feeling great. Ben Simmons is playing great, so a lot of homers in my sub are saying, ‚ÄúThank god we didn‚Äôt trade him, fuck Harden!‚Äù But Harden is playing like a top 3 player right now. Ben is playing like a top 20 player. To me, that‚Äôs worth surrendering your draft control for the next five years (your window anyway) to pair two top 3 players together.   Anyway, missing on Harden is just the latest in a comedy of errors going all the way back to forcing Hinkie out. In summary:  1) Force Hinkie out 2) Hire the Colangelos 3) Trade draft capital to move back into the first round to take Andres Paschecniks (out of the league) 4) Trade a FRP to move up (with your biggest rival) to draft Fultz.  5) New GM because your last bad one couldn‚Äôt stop making fun of his own players with fake Twitter accounts. But first, your coach will run the draft! Proceed to draft the perfect 3+D wing, Mikal Bridges, a senior from a championship team. Wait, nope, you‚Äôll trade him for a total project who‚Äôs now out of the league. 6) New GM proceeds to liquidate remaining assets for the wrong players: Jimmy and Tobi inbound 7) Despite being the wrong players, you‚Äôre now pot committed so it‚Äôs time to pay up for Jimmy because you need a real guard initiator/scorer. Nope. You let him walk and sign a washed big man: welcome to Philly Al Horford. Oh, and let JJ walk because you want to save money on tax. Snag Josh Richardson for Jimmy who will promptly prove his 3-pt shooting was a flash in the pan. 8) Owners clean house because they don‚Äôt like how their own mistakes taste. But welcome to Doc and Morey who will try to make this roster work, without having sufficient draft capital or decent contracts to trade.   Being a Sixers fan is fun! But hey, at least Embiid looks like a top-10 all-time big man. There‚Äôs that."
"Oh that would be a big haul for Orlando. JV is good also obviously a significant downgrade but that's a solid starting center. And Anderson has been a legit starting caliber 3/4. I wouldnt do that if Memphis but that's probably the type of offer Orlando is looking for yes.  I agree I dont think it ever happens with Boston, Vuc also isnt the kind of defensive center I think Danny Ainge would really want to commit to if he ever spent on the position like he did with Al Horford once. Boston is in a weird spot because tbh it's harder for them to make a big splash now than it has been in the past. Nobody is touching Kemba, Jaylen/Tatum arent getting moved, all those picks are now young players who are mostly meh etc. And Danny just doesnt make significant deals unless he thinks he's really coming out way ahead"

I think you're right but like isn't that the problem. Theis doesn't really have Horfords skill set. Like he's a good shooter but at the 4 nobody is gonna leave him open. Al could legit switch at the tail end of his prime. I also always figured playing horford at the 4 was more appeasing horford who didn't like playing 5 vs like stevens actual philosophy. I think part of the reason y'all beat us that year is he kind've brilliantly gave Baynes the green light on those open Baynes corner 3s but like Thompson can't make those shots and Theis just isn't Horford.

So unguardable that they signed Al Horford to a $109 million contract
2019 Al Horford was pretty good at it too
"Nice topic.  There are two best ""Embiid stoppers"" in recent NBA seasons: Al Horford (Celtics) and Marc Gasol (Raptors)  Both of them out of this race in the East right now and as you said, there are not much player in the conference who can guard Joel. After every success, every rival should counter for biggest threat.   In a word, yes, If Sixers can success this season, teams will try to get and create Embiid stoppers."
"Should be easy. All you have to do is select ‚Äúimport DNA‚Äù when you‚Äôre in the player creation menu, and select 2019 Marc Gasol or 2018 Al Horford."

"Any team with Al Horford starting next to their superstar center, clogging up the entire floor would struggle to win a playoff series. Completely different team this year and current 1 seed.

"You can always trade for ""the Embiid stopper"" aka Al Horford."
The main difference is he can take more pull up trigger threes and he's more decisive with the ball in his hands. Also he now plays the 4 and with seth curry and Danny Green instead of al Horford and josh Richardson. I think that's bigger for tobi.

"1. Sign and trades are a thing, the players are usually notified beforehand. And most teams arent high on trading a player, so if they do its either because theyre a bad team fit (Al Horford, Josh Richardson) or the player themselves is disgruntled as has asked to be traded (Anthony Davis, KG, Ray Allen). And if a player has not asked to be traded, their careers are giving a better chance to succeed like we saw in the James Harden, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Lowry, Zach LaVine, etc. trades.   2. Rookie caps are (afaik) to protect teams ~~like the Timberwolves and Pistons~~ from making Joe Smith, Aaron Gordon, Harrison Barnes ass contracts. It sucks dick that players cant immediately choose their team, but as stated earlier they can demand a trade or even sit out games much like Jimmy Butler until they get traded or trades/signings are made to improve their team. I wouldnt mind if rookie caps are repealed, though. They are scaled depending on where in the draft you were taken, so theres that.   3. The fact players cant immediately cant choose their team is that it also gives small market teans (like the Cavaliers and Warriors) a chance to grow their status. If Lebron left Cleveland for somewhere like LA or Boston immediately on draft night the Cavs likely wouldnt be a franchise as of right now.  4. And I'm not entirely sure on this but I believe its possible to get a contract raise if youre already on a contract? I remember Dirk willingly taking pay cuts in order to improve his team but I'm not entirely sure on the other way around.   TL;DR theres a lot of ***nuance*** in these decisions made that make more sense if you look at them beyond face value."
"there are downsides to long contract I agree. lika a team deciding to trade your ass to anywhere...   but there's also an upside. if you play bad (see KLove, Griffin, Al Horford, Batum), you still to get to get paid way more than your worth.   if you want to not be moved and have choice where to play, sign short contracts. but wanting your cake (a long guaranted contract) and to eat it too is not realistic."

"Bulls could give up porter for him if they wanted him  The mavs could give James Johnson and one of a few others   The nuggets have a few players on pretty big contracts that are tradable  Warriors could give Wiggins  The rockets got olidipo, or Gordon  The griz have a bunch of things they could give  The heat have iggy and Kelly   The t wolves have Ricky  Pelicans have adams  Okc had al horford   The magic have Gordon  The trail blazers have nurkic + another little bit   The kings have Harrison Barnes   San antonio has LA  The wiz have bertons  I could argue all those players are non essential. And Ik a lot of them ofc would never trade for Drummond but most teams have tradable pieces for Drummond"
"If the Warriors ownership was willing to pay infinite tax, they absolutely are not chasing Al Horford."
The disrespect to AL Horford and JRich
Is AL Horford any good? Haven't seen him play in a while. Last I heard he was washed.
"Al Horford, sitting at home &amp; cashing max levels checks sounds pretty legit."
Definitely Al Horford. He's gotten a couple massive contracts and he's married to Miss Universe
Al Horford. His sister is so fine
Al Horford  Paid to do nothing
"It's honestly some hardcore 2k level rebuilding. Having 49 million committed next season is ridiculous. I think they'd try and match a few offers on Svi, and maybe Tony Bradley. They're also in a great position to get an absolute haul when they offload Horford at some stage. Contenders will be licking their lips at signing a rested Al Horford and also potentially clearing cap, but its damm sure gonna cost some assets."
We have shooters and Al Horford is out of the league
LeBron is warning us that the Thunder are gonna find some way to get Al Horford to the Lakers on a 1 dollar salary
"That‚Äôs tuff, same Al Horford led Celtics that basically swept your team"
Against the Oladipo Pacers and the Al Horford led Celtics? Lmao yeah I do.
"Imagine Joe Johnson and al Horford with young Chris Paul, that‚Äôs an ECF team competing with Boston, Cleveland, Detroit and Orlando in the late 2000‚Äôs"
"Gotta feel bad for the Kings. They haven't finished a season over .500 since 2006.  For clarification, that was LeBron's first year in the playoffs.   Chris Paul, Derron Williams, and Andrew Bogut made the All-Rookie team that year.   Clifford Robinson and Kevin Willis were still kicking around.   LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and J. J. Reddick weren't even in the league at that time.   Al Horford and Joakim Noah were teammates in college. Kevin Durant was a year away from declaring for the draft.   Derrick Rose was still in high school.   Blake Griffin was 5 years away from playing his first NBA game.   Antony Davis was still in GRADE school.   Luka would have been in the second grade!  LaMelo Ball would have been in pre-school.  &amp;#x200B;  THAT'S how long it has been since the Kings were over .500.   &amp;#x200B;  :-("
Al Horford got the [DNP - Old](https://i.redd.it/91op236qbvq61.jpg) a few days ago.
Want Al Horford for a pick then?
"Yo, listen - their fanbase was clowning us after they swept Simmonsless Al Horford Sixers. We need revenge. You can have them next year."
PG: Terry Rozier   SG: Aron baynes  SF: Jason Tatum  PF: Marcus Morris   C: Al Horford  They destroyed us that entire season
Don‚Äôt forget al horford
"Honestly, Al Horford being only 6'9"" is a shock. I wouldn't be surprised if that was off as I for sure have seen that number at 6'10"" in the past. He plays bigger than that number for sure.   Either way, there is a difference, albeit small, between 6'9/10"" and 6'8"". Having that height differential and becoming a good center is the exception, not the norm. So my point stands."
"Well I've heard a lot of people say Horford is trash and not really the center of the team, and I completely disagree with that.   As good as the Jays are, Horford was the anchor of that team that both did the dirty work and could pick up the slack in scoring if their ISO ball wasn't working.  Hell, even Marcus Morris was good for those kinds of nights as well, though he was probably much less valuable than Al."
nah they had a good center al horford but they have done nothing to replace him
Nah. They tried playing like it was the 80s. That twin towers shit not working with Embiid and AL HORFORD. Especially when your point guard isn‚Äôt shooting.   This year they did the logical thing and picked up shooters.
"The NBA has way higher AAV contacts though.  Bryce Harper is making less than Al Horford this year.  Trout, Lindor, and Cole make about the same as Paul George, Mike Conley, Kawhi Leonard and Tobias Harris.  I was really shocked when Bauer got $102 million over the next three years but that deal has two opt-outs and other crazy stuff."
Al Horford. Not on purpose I just shoot like that lol
Jayson Tatum was carried by others in his first playoff series against Philly and then went 4-0 against a Philly team without Simmons and the corpse of Al Horford. Try and keep up
Al Horford is not washed
"And then you realize he turned a a 5‚Äô10 dude into an mvp candidate, a team with its best player being al horford to game 7 of the ecf, and turned brown and Tatum into stars, and then realize that Jeff Fucking Teague doesn‚Äôt really matter in the grand scheme of things"
"Only 16% of Jaylen Browns shots come from mid range 2s, and he shoots them at a great clip. His shot selection has literally nothing to do with the Celtics offensive struggles.   The Celtics struggles come mainly from the ISO heavy offense they play. And before you try and put the blame on the Celtics current personnel, here's the Celtics rank in the NBA in ISO possessions per game   2021 - 7th  2020 - 8th   2019 - 8th   2018 - 7th   Doesn't matter if we have Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Kemba Walker, or the Jays. The Celtics have been an ISO heavy team for years, and the only common denominator is Brad Stevens."
"We had no Simmons, JRich, Al Horford, and Brett brown. Very different team"
"OKC isnt getting a blue chip prospect with Al Horford  I think Dinwiddie is actually a good vet fit with SGA and the (possibly) 2 high draft picks they'll have this year, and he not he's infinitely more flippable at next year's deadline than Al Horford is."
Al Horford - 28
"I agree with you that organizational philosophies differ, but both teams are going through a rebuild. When Presti acquired Horford they were a completely different team who finished fifth in the west. Where they were when they acquired Al is a lot different than the circumstances they‚Äôre in now."
"He is nothing special at the 3 for center. He ranks 36th for centers in terms of 3point percentage at 33%, and he attempts 1 per game. You are talking about his jumpshot like he's Al Horford (36.8%, 5.4 attempts per game) but he shoots  like Nurkic who is also 33.3% and attempts 1.1 per game."
"It's not a team option.  Basically if you trade for Horford this offseason you're absorbing something between a 2/$41.5M and a 2/$53.5M.    So, bare minimum you need to be totally cool with paying 36 year old Al Horford real money.  Which is the entire problem with trading him.  That's a *big* contract to take on - most contenders can find better things to spend money on."
al horford
and Al Horford is better than Luka
"Al Horford much like the Orlando Magic, shut it down for the season at the trade deadline."
Lucky for embiid he doesn‚Äôt have to go against his dads al horford and Marc gasol
Shouldn't they be under investigation for shutting down Al Horford anyway?
"*checks notes*  Yes, the Celtics have indeed lost Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, and Marcus Morris in the last 5 years. Great observation man"
Paul Millsap and Al Horford
malik beasley definitely could be starting for a good team and his contract is looking nice.  al horford would be a wanted commodity if he made 10mil less.
"Also a low key tribute to Al Horford, who has no relation to these two teams"
"And that is why I said it's a boring take. But I can't take anything you say seriously. You basically said out of the two teams, Al Horford is the best player lol..."
Al Horford was better than your ‚ÄúMVP‚Äù Gobert.
Name one person on that roster that is better than this years Jazz. Pero Antic?  Kent Bazemore?  Elton Brand?  DeMarre Carroll?  Austin Daye?  Al Horford?  John Jenkins?  Kyle Korver(ILY)?  Shelvin Mack(UPSHELVINS)?  Paul Millsap(ILY2)?  Mike Muscala?  Adreian Payne?  Dennis Schroder?  Mike Scott?  Thabo Sefolosha?  Jeff Teague?
That‚Äôs Al Horford money
"&gt;Also Horford is like at best their 4th or 5th best player  Not that it was ever gonna happen, but when they had their ads trying to promote their guys to make the All Star team, it was SGA and Horford who they were pushing. Al was terrible on the Sixers because he was a bad fit but I think he can still play. I think he'd be somewhere from 2nd to 5th best on the Thunder. Outside of SGA, who else is definitely better than him?"
"What you mentioned. Shooters, a pass first PG, a defensive coach, a roll man that can pick and pop too, id figure a big man like Al Horford would be perfect."
Do you think Al Horford saves these two games for the Thunder?
"Shai is legit injured, Dort is in concussion protocol and couldn't play even if he felt good to go.      If you think Al Horford saves these games for the Thunder..."
Still sucks that we could've had both of them... but Brand decided to choose Al freakin Horford over Jimmy.
George Hill wasn‚Äôt healthy when he stopped playing for them  Al Horford was
He dumped Al Horford off the back of his seadoo and then left him in the middle of a lake.
If it‚Äôs not Al Horford it‚Äôs not the worst contract in the league.
"Conaidering the roster Bud was working with, he gets far too much criticism for that series (and I'm no Bud apologist or anything).  That Hawks team had a starting 5 of Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver, DeMarre Carroll, Paul Millsap, and Al Horford.  Their main bench players were Dennis Schr√∂der, Kent Bazemore, Mike Scott, and Pero Antiƒá.  Lots of solid players, but does it really surprise you that Lebron swept them when he pretty much single handedly brought the Warriors to 6 in the finals? (plus he had Irving in 2 of the games against the hawks vs just 1 game in the finals)"
"&gt; Oden had one good game in the tournament against al Horford  Yeah...you mean the fucking National Championship game?  &gt; He mostly dunked on smaller college players   Just like every big prospect who played in college   &gt; Oden was barely better in college at 19 than Andrew Bynum was in the nba at 20  Oden was the defensive player of the year, 2nd team all american, Best big man award, and first team all big ten. And yes no shit an nba player is going to be better than a college player when Oden hasn‚Äôt played nba competition yet. That‚Äôs how development works"
"&gt;Did you watch Oden? He was one of the best big man prospects ever  Yes, I watched him plenty.  He mostly dunked on smaller college players for 15 ppg, at 19 years old.  The best big man prospects were already in the NBA at that age, or doing more in college.  Oden had one good game in the tournament against Al Horford, but was otherwise unremarkable.  He had nothing for Roy Hibbert, and played even weaker games against even weaker competition -- 9 points and 3 rebounds in a 1-pt win over Tennessee and Wayne Chism, for example.  It's easy to be fooled by college players dunking on much smaller opposition.  Look how they play against the best teams and players -- and Oden was inconsistent at best.  He scored 20+ points 5 times in his college career, and averaged just under 10 boards.  For a kid his size and age, that's merely good.  Oden was barely better in college at 19 than Andrew Bynum was in the NBA at 20 -- so if Oden was ever going to be even an All-star, he needed to develop much more than he showed at Ohio State."
They should trade him to OKC for Al Horford and some picks. Could really help their center rotation.
"with the help of Al Horford, and dont you forget it!"
You didn‚Äôt have effective players to make that choice lol.  Al Horford is about to be 35 and nobody was tuning in to see him. This OKC team is still miles better than those process teams
He's like DeAndre Jordan if h√© was taught how to play by Al Horford
"I mean he destroyed Al Horford, Tatum and Brown."
"These guys are obviously casuals lol. Let‚Äôs think of those IT teams... IT, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, Amir Johnson, and Al Horford, with Smart, Jerebko, T. Zeller, 22yo Rozier, and 20yo JB off the bench.   Imagine saying ‚ÄúIT made Brad look way better than he is‚Äù with a roster like that haha. r/nba is filled with some of the dumbest people lol."
I picked him up on the waiver wire last week when Al Horford got shut down. So far he‚Äôs been an awesome pickup!
... am I crazy to nominate Al Horford as one candidate?
fine I guess we'll accept that bum luka for al horford.
"A contending team thats over the cap really shouldn't be buying out anyone. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think the Nets still have a first. If they can get Dinwiddie to opt in and also add someone with their taxpayer MLE, they could go for AL Horford for example and add in young players and picks they have left."
I'm so tired this at this point just force NBA players to sponsor WNBA players. Al horford ain't doing anything he could cover like 6 rosters payrolls
He‚Äôs a great fit in the sense that his name is Greg Monroe or al horford
Wow even Eric Bledsoe huh  Tatum had kyrie irving/Marcus Morris/Marcus smart/al horford/jaylen brown and couldn‚Äôt even get out the second round
"I mean they‚Äôve signed Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, and Kemba Walker in the last few years. None were superstars but all were, at the time of signing, All-Star caliber players"
"True but don't forget the Al Horford contract that my Sixers signed him to... And Holmes is quite a bit younger. You never know a team may be willing to overpay Holmes especially since Centers are on the rise again with Embiid, Bam, Jokic, KAT, etc."
"His leg exploded in the first 5 minutes of his first game. Al Horford and Kemba Walker were also free agents, they like(d) it there."
"Come on dude, you know this is bogus. Theyre sitting a healthy Al Horford. The FO wants to lose games .  The players are winning games because they are playing better than Sam Presti thought they would , this isnt a ""winning culture"" situation"
"Yes... Being in NYC means always getting the star free agents. The knicks signing Lebron and Wade in 2010 was really unfair for the league.   Before KD and Kyrie the biggest free agent signing for the nets in brooklyn was (checks notes) a washed andrei kirilenko (and people cried about that signing as well).  The celtics the last 6 years have signed Al horford, Gordan Hayward and Kemba Walker all coming off all star seasons."
"Such as making it to the ECF with a line up of   IT, Bradley, Crowder, Amir Johnson, and Al Horford  and pushed LeBron to 7 in the ECF  Terry Rozier, sophomore Jaylen Brown, rookie Jayson Tatum, Marcus Morris and Al Horford.  Which of those is ""less with more""?"
"&gt;	But most importantly, it‚Äôs a culture where every decision made, starting from the owner all the way down to the lowest fitness coach or w/e, is made with the express intent that the team wins as many games as possible regardless of the current context  Looks at Al Horford..."
"Moses ""demigod"" brown exist.   On a real note, Moses brown is Hella a steal, being able to be a consistent scorer and a really good rebounder.   The team also have young players that sometime light up once in a blue moon that contribute them to win games. Playing hard as a team even without any veterans avaible on the floor every night ( I believe Al horford Barely play anymore)"
We'll take him if you give us a pick. You can also have   *checks notes*  Al Horford
Thunder probably looking at DJ like [this](https://i.imgflip.com/1x0up9.jpg) . Al Horford too good for the tank smh.
"The Celtics. As a sixers fan I find it funny when Celtics fans bring up the fact that they swept us in the playoffs last year when we didn‚Äôt have Ben Simmons, Brett brown was our coach, we had al horford starting, and our bench was Kyle oquinn,James Ennis, mike Scott, and Raul NetoüòÇ"
Is Al Horford really out for the rest of the season due to rest?
There was a point where every undersized center who was a top prospect was compared to Al Horford but I'll admit I haven't seen one compared to him in a while.
"Yes, he was 19-20, 7 feet tall, athletic, and just dominated the National Championship game against Joakim Noah and Al Horford"
Kevin Love: Malibu  Westbrook: Clippers   John Wall: Glue Factory  Al Horford:  Lakers/Warriors/Heat
Kevin Love- Timberwolves  John Wall- Wizards   Al Horford- retires and takes up crocheting  Russell Westbrook- Thunder
"Will Al Horford and a first work?   We also would like PJ Tucker, Demarcus Cousins, and any other player over 6‚Äô7 on the roster in return.   Forget harden actually, just give us all the power forwards please!"
Al horford worse
"He woulda hit the game winner in his last game against Boston as a Laker too if the refs hadn't missed a clear goaltend by Al Horford, interfering with his shot through the net. It worked out though, Rondo hit it instead."
"What? Lost Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Kyrie Irving, Marcus Morris, and Gordon Hayward. That's a playoff starting 5 in the east"
Gonna sign Kyle out of retirement with the other roster spot then snag Al Horford in the offseason
We could have provided (1) Mike Muscala and (1) Al Horford
They are basically doing that this season and already probably won too many games to get as high of pick they wanted.   This team could have fought for the 10th seed if they weren't resting everyone and played rotations that actually made sense.   SGA developed into a fringe all-star. Dort is a solid NBA starter that would be in any teams rotation. And Poku doesn't look completely lost anymore. Theo Maledon looks like steal in the 2nd round. Moses Brown is basically prime Shaq. Only disappointment has been Bazely but he's still only 20 years old.   Difference is OKC has a plan from the top down. The plan is very clear and everyone is on-board from the Owners to Front Office to the Coach to the Players.   I mean fuck Al Horford has been in OKC for 5 months and is already on board with the tank.
Frank ntilikina   Al horford
"I'm telling you, though, this is a trap. One year Aron Baynes and Al Horford turned super saiyan against you guys. If Evan Fournier breaks the playoff 3 pt record and Tatum averages 35 against the sixers, then the next series they get swept by the Nets, at least you were warned about it."
"Aldridge could have came to the Knicks on a one year deal at 40-50%.  I think the best way is to have it a high number to reduce the amount of strain on small markets. Instead of blowing big money on a role player you can gamble that a buyout will occur and use your salary over there. IMO you need a little downward pressure on the NBA salaries you have over the hill players like Al Horford taking big 5 year contracts for 1-2 good years. For a buying team that is still a decent deal because you can't get much better due to the free agent class etc. But you have the chance to pick up a Blake, Morris twin, Zubac level player for 6-7 mil, it doesn't seem as worth to give Al a 5 year/120 mil deal"
All I am saying is if someone gives a player a deal due current market that they physically don‚Äôt deserve literally a year in to it and than team continues to pay them and but they have to sit...is not a bad situation to be in. Al Horford does not need to ‚Äúrescued‚Äù from his current situation. We don‚Äôt need rules that ruin parity in the league so 35 year olds get paid millions of dollars and walk in to championship rings.
"Russ and John Wall are indeed untradeable UNLESS they‚Äôre being traded for one another. Same was true for Christopher Emmanuel Paul after he looked like was in stark decline in his last year in Houston. After the season he had in OKC, he put himself on a different planet then either of those guys as well as big Al Horford."
Al Horford or Joe Johnson
"You signed Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, and Kemba Walker all within like 3-4 years. That‚Äôs better than like 90% of the league could do."
Al Horford but the warriors have to throw in two additional firsts.
"Ah yes the terrible, healthy in the playoffs starting line up of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward and Al Horford with Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Daniel Theis, Aron Baynes and Robert Williams of the bench 3 years ago. A 4-1 loss in the second round is all that could be expected of such a subpar roster. PJ Dozier on a two way then"
"There was not a good center available after the 8th pick. Also you guys had Al Horford, Baynes, and Theis so center wasn't your main issue back then."
Al Horford at center from 2016-2019 doesn't count?
Kevin Love   Bradley Beal   Domantas Sabonis   Nikola Vucevic   Al Horford   Paul Millsap   LaMarcus Aldridge   Mike Conley   Khris Middleton   DeMarcus Cousins   CJ McCollum
"I think that's overstating it a bit for the Eastern Conference. Definitely more true in the West at that time though.  -  Eastern Conference centers in the playoffs that season:  * Chicago: Joakim Noah * Miami: Joel Anthony * Boston: Jermaine O'Neal * Orlando: Dwight Howard * Atlanta: Al Horford * New York: Amare Stoudemire * Philadelphia: Elton Brand * Indiana: Roy Hibbert  -  Eastern Conference small forward in the playoffs that season:  * Chicago: Luol Deng  * Miami: LeBron James * Boston: Paul Pierce * Orlando: Hedo Turkoglu * Atlanta: Josh Smith * New York: Carmelo Anthony * Philadelphia: Andre Iguodala * Indiana: Danny Granger  -  The centers are hit-or-miss, but the SFs are absolutely stacked."
Paul George Kawhi Leonard John Wall Dwight Howard Al Horford Kyrie Irving / Uncle Drew  Zach Lavine Donovan Mitchell Ben Simmons  Kemba Walker
"This is actually really amazing. Check out the list from 10 years ago (2010-11 season):  1) Kevin Love: 15.2 (USA)  2) Dwight Howard: 14.1 (USA)  3) Zach Randolph: 12.2 (USA)  4) Blake Griffin: 12.1 (USA)  5) Kris Humphries: 10.4 (USA)  6) Pau Gasol: 10.2 (Spain)  7) David Lee: 9.8 (USA)  8) Al Jefferson: 9.7 (USA)  9) Emeka Okafor: 9.5 (USA)  10) Tyson Chandler: 9.4 (USA)  Okafor's parents are from Nigeria but he was born and raised in the USA and is an American citizen  Humphries only played 44 games, though‚Äî11th place w/ 77 GP was Al Horford, who is Dominican"
"Well if you asked this around 4 years ago the Celtics were the #1 pick for this question.   That roster will be a conundrum for people in the future  &gt;Kyrie Irving &gt;Jaylen Brown &gt;Jayson Tatum &gt;Gordon Hayward  &gt;Al Horford  That‚Äôs just insane considering the role players like Marcus Smart, Aaron Baynes, Daniel Theis, Terry Rozier, and Marcus Morris. They also had draft picks galore, a great young coach, and solid management.  The point is it is a lot harder to win irl than it is on paper, and it‚Äôs hard to forecast the future.  Can‚Äôt believe that got fucked up so hard in so many different ways."
"Al Horford maybe? Not exactly a current star but he made an all-star game as recently as 2018. Five all-star selections, one all-NBA 3rd team, one 2nd team all-defense, and 1st -team all-rookie. Not exactly a star but he played at a high level for a long time.  Another one is Boogie, made four straight all-star games and two all-NBA teams before injuries tore his career apart."
"Those were NOT the same Sixers lol. They lost Ben and Redick too, and replaced Jimmy with a net negative in Al Horford."
yeah but i‚Äôm not staying up all night to see Al Horford
"Al Horford Resume:   College National Champion  SEC Tournament MVP  5x All-Star   1x All-NBA   1x All-Defense  1x Centrobasket Gold Medalist   1x FIBA Bronze Medalist, with a non-America team (always viewed as impressive)   Derrick Rose Resume:   1x MVP  3x All Star   1x All-NBA  2008 ROY   2x FIBA Gold Medalist   So...not really an opinion just more like backed up by history facts"
"Yeah, the Raptors weren‚Äôt fined for resting or tanking. They were fined for a lack of transparency about the reasons why. Also, the Thunder have a (whether you buy it or not) competitive reason to give the league: they want to try out and develop young center prospects in Brown and Bradley, whereas Al is not going to be with the Thunder after this season. That reason may be totally dubious, but it‚Äôs hard for the league to say you can‚Äôt play young players to try to develop them instead of old guys like Horford."
Lol sorry bro but I don‚Äôt care about those stats at all there‚Äôs no exact written criteria for the hof. If you seriously think al horford has a better chance of getting in the hall compared to d rose then you need to re-evaluate why you even watch basketball lmao
He has a better overall case for the hall than DRose so if you are arguing for DRose you are arguing for him.   Basketball Reference has a Hall of Fame probability predictor.   Al Horford sits at a 12.2% chance   DRose sits at a 11.9% chance   Rondo is at 60%   Gilbert Arenas is at 24%
Idk how you convinced yourself that I‚Äôm arguing for al horford to be in the hall but aight man lol
"If we had the roster to limit his role to bringing him off the bench for like 10-15 mins a game, it'd be fine (though I expect he'd still make just as many boneheaded plays as good ones). With our roster depleted, he's playing too many minutes and is way, way out of his depth.  I remember he used to start for those Budenholzer Hawks teams... Not sure how they were able to have a 60 win season w/ him starting. Maybe his low IQ play was made up for by high IQ play by Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver, etc..."
"Well it would be a shame if DRose got in, would hurt the hall even more.   Hope you change your mind or prepare to defend Al Horford Hall of Famer...."
If DRose gets in you are opening the door for a lot of players who have done more than him getting in   If DRose is in the Hall you say everyone on the below list should make it today:   Kemba Walker  Tim Hardaway SR.   Shawn Marion   Rajon Rondo   Jimmy Butler   John Wall  Jermaine O‚ÄôNeal   Al Horford
"It would have been the exact same thing.  Contrary to popular opinion, there isn't a major schematic difference between Brett and Doc.  The only major changes are on defense with Embiid playing less drop coverage.    The main difference between the Sixers from last year to this year are spacing that Danny Green and Seth Curry provide that Al Horford and Josh Richardson do not.    If anything Butlers lack of consistent 3pt shooting would have led to the problems we had last season and the season prior.  Tobias wouldn't have space and opportunity to post up.  Joel would have very little space to manuever and harder double teams to face.  Ben would still stuck in the dunkers spot."
The Thunder sat our boy Al Horford. Celtics tanked the tank out of spite
"I mean, we are playing the same players if healthy as we did before the deadline besides Al Horford.  If this is disgraceful, we might need a good draft pick."
Al Horford perfectly content chilling on a beach somewhere.   If I was SGA I would want no part of this shitshow either.
"Your definition.   My definition is the thunder over the last 26 games have a net efficiency of almost -20.   Believed to be the worst of all time.  More than twice as bad as the 10-72 Sixers from a few years ago.   They sent home Al Horford specifically to tank.   Not a thing wrong with him.   George Hill helped them win a couple games, got to go.   SGA, plantar fascitas or plantar tankitis?"
Im talking last 26 games since al horford was banished.   Sga got hurt.  George hill traded.   Worst team ever
Not surprised. Out starting lineup is a joy to watch. Have to say Morey pulling off Danny Green for Al Horford is legendary
"Not really, SGA tore his foot up. Not much you can do about that.  Al Horford is not gonna change this stat too much."
"Man, everyone clowned us this summer for signing Plumlee. Then he balled out slightly so we've sat him a handful of games to keep him healthy for a potential trade this summer and apparently it's some mortal sin.  Meanwhile five-time NBA Allstar Al Horford has just been vibing for like 50 games."
"I mean, I still can‚Äôt quite wrap my head around the fact that everyone‚Äôs just okay with the fact that OKC shut down a healthy Al Horford for like 40% of the season despite the fact that he‚Äôs still good and under contract for 2 more years."
&gt;The only common denominator between both teams is Stevens   Well Actually the common denominators are the Jays. I think that they both should be traded this off season for the way the team has underperformed. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum for Ty Jerome and Al Horford who says no?
How did SGA and Al Horford win with this team?  The world may never know.
Who are they sitting lol I guarantee you they can play Al Horford and still lose games
"If you somehow create a post omplaining about us not getting fined without using the words ""tank"", ""Al Horford"", ""disgrace"", ""losing"", ""rest"", and ""fake injury"", I will award your post"
The team was already bad before SGA was injured and Al Horford sat out. We only managed some wins because SGA was going ballistic before the trade deadline.
"Oh boy, here come the posts   [""The fine has more to do with transparency (or lack thereof) from the team""](https://twitter.com/jlew1050/status/1383546493437505542?s=21)  Al Horford decided to sit down because he agreed with the team moving forward with a path toward ""player development"". You can call it tanking all you want and say it's a disgrace to competition or whatever, but I think it's better for everyone that we see Moses Brown or Tony Bradley, two players who have something to prove and is fighting for their literal NBA lives, play than Al Horford half ass games because he's forced to.  Anyone who argues otherwise most likely does not actually watch our games and is just mad we managed to get to third best odds for the draft."
"Do you see how tight the tanking race is right now? We are talking game differentials in a top heavy draft. He‚Äôs been out since the all star break when they were in the playoff and shai was healthy. Al Horford has a positive impact and is a fantastic defender, he has an impact. They aren‚Äôt losing by 40 EVERY night, lazy take"
"LMAOO I know a pistons fan aint saying this... jerami grant and plumlee get pulled constantly, and youre mad about old ass Al Horford..."
Fr people are acting like Al Horford is the difference between a blowout loss and a win. Thunder's season was over the minute Shai went down with injury.
1. It‚Äôs obvious they did that and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm upset. Everyone can read the read the room   2. Al Horford is 2 tiers below an all star but doesn‚Äôt have the age or potential to live up towards the contract. If he was making a matchable salary he would be on a competitive team
So should Al Horford be punished for asking the team to not play and them agreeing to it?
"It kinda pisses me off, there has to be some sorta repercussions. I get playing ass players, extending recovery times, and all the tanking sorts I‚Äôm for it. But straight up shutting down healthy Al Horford is too much"
"Plus maybe like kyrie and al horford, man we would be unstoppable!"
"he's there, and he's already Highly Effective.     He isnt playing a First option offensive role... so his points are down. He is shooting less than 4 shots that last season. With similar minutes.  He is playing the Marc Gasol and Al Horford role.... reliable big man playing a key role in a system that is translating to wins.   he could probably average 23+ points now if he just try to take more shots but it will likely hurt the team's system and success."
"Adams was already on a terrible contract in OKC and Pelicans decided to not only give up assets for him, but to also extend him at a price far above his market price. He's a slightly above average rim protector and rebounder, but bad shooter, passer, shot creator, and perimeter defender.  At his salary, you could find many shooting 5s with average defense and you wouldn't need to give up assets to get them. Al Horford, a far superior shooter  and facilitator with comparable defense, has the same amount of years left on his contract and you could've gotten a first round pick for taking him on instead of giving picks away.  In regards to your point about Favors, you had great spacing last season because you had Jrue instead of Bledsoe. There's only so many non-shooters you can have on the court at once before all spacing dies. Once the Pelicans made a move to get Bledsoe, which was b4 the Adams trade, they should've known not to take on another expensive rotation piece in Adams who can't shoot."
Sixers legend Al Horford
"Dwight Howard, Al Horford"
"This should be on Danny Ainge. That roster is ASS outside of Tatum, Brown and Smart. The miss Al Horford bad in the frontcourt too. His passing and defense made everybody job easier."
"Sounds like an oversimplification that ignores a lot of factors.   First and foremost, the loss of Al Horford.   Horford was huge. His impact was grossly underrated, and they've got nobody to compensate for what he did.  Second, this season has been an anomalous year, and NOT team in the NBA outside of perhaps the Suns and Jazz have been playing to their potential.   On top of that, Kyrie wasn't scapegoated: the team didn't perform as well with him because he is an individual talent and not a team talent.   Jay Williams is COMPLETELY ignoring the fact that the Celtics made two conference finals WITHOUT Kyrie and made another AFTER he left.   But the Celtics have lost talent.  No Horford. No Hayward. They lost a franchise played in Kyrie and got nothing back. They lost Scary Terry.   So yeah, they aren't as good as they were.  They only criticism I would have of Stevens is his failure to come up with an answer the Heat's zone last year.   Sound, this sounds like a shitty 'hot' take."
"You‚Äôre right, I meant 2 - but I disagree with the years. In 2017-18 the loss of Irving/Hayward made a finals run improbable and I give Stevens credit for that run (also Al Horford, his importance in that run was super underrated). In 2018-19, that was the year everyone picked Boston to make the finals with certainty damn near. Even after playing poorly in the regular season people still picked Boston to make it due to having a playoff switch that no one on the roster had. In 2019-20 the expectations to make the finals weren‚Äôt always there but once they got to the ECF, I really believe they had the talent to win (even without Hayward). I just think Stevens got outcoached there"
"Michael Carter-Williams had 22/7/12 with 9 steals in his first career game   He played 70 games that season. Assuming he played 70 games for 8 years, while maintaining those numbers he‚Äôd have 12, 320 points   That‚Äôs more than Al Horford and Jrue Holiday"
This man could‚Äôve put George Hill and Al Horford around Zion to space the floor while still preserving the defense but instead chose brick feet Adams and Bledsoe who is a subpar defender now
"Jojo played PF last season next to Al Horford. This season Tobi is the center and Jojo is small forward.  He is clearly a forward. Next season Ben at the 5, Jojo at the point."
"&gt;Dwight's accomplishment is having a better year than Andrew Bogut  He made all nba 3rd team in 2007 under Amare and Yao Ming  (and in 2013 under Marc Gasol and Tim Duncan) - not with Magic  (Made all nba 2nd team in 2014 under Joakim Noah (4th in MVP votes, more than Harden, Curry and CP3 combined) and over Al Jefferson) - not with Magic  And made all nba 1st team over  in 2008: Amare and Yao Ming  in 2009: Yao Ming and Shaq  in 2010: Amare and Andrew Bogut  in 2011: Amare and Al Horford  in 2012: Andrew Bynum and Tyson Chandler  He was better than HOF Yao Ming and pre-injury Amare"
"&gt;	Yawn. You can have your regular season championship and awards.   Ya those awards are apparently meaningless now haven‚Äôt you heard? You don‚Äôt like them because Curry decimates Durant on that level.   &gt;	Curry Finals record with KD: 9-1 &gt; &gt;	Curry Finals record without KD: 8-11  What a moronic way to compare things as if the earlier post season doesn‚Äôt matter? Lol   Anyways ill end this on a note which you really can‚Äôt say shit about lol:  Who joined who? Who joined who after getting their ass handed to them in 2016? Who joined a **73 win team** after getting clapped a few month prior.   Imagine if Curry went to Cleveland after losing ? Lmao you realize this is what Durant did, no? Why did no one take him seriously the moment he ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùwon rings‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù? Oh right, because he joined a 73 win team like a coward instead of trying again with a stacked roster who was going to get al horford in the off-season."
"If it's any consolation I know exactly how you feel right now. Watching al Horford leave and trash our city and fanbase and team hurt, and the years between rebuilding till now were rough."
"We had Greg Monroe and Boban. Not sure if Amir Johnson was still on the team at the time.   Yeah we didn't get Embiid a decent backup until we moved Al Horford to the Bench last year, and even then the spacing was so dogshit it never really mattered.  Turning last years roster into what we have now is the reason why I love having Morey so much. A good backup 5 in Dwight, which is a major need, but also having Danny Green and Seth Curry next to Embiid has given him so much more space to operate and gives him players who he can pass out to that make their shots at a decent rate."
"The Clippers. The Hawks would be fun to watch with T-Mac, Stackhouse, Josh Smith, Joe Johnson, Al Horford, Hinrich, Jeff Teague, Marvin Williams, Radmanovic, Erick Dampier, Zaza, and Willie Green."
"Less than two months after his 27th birthday, Joel Embiid looks like one of the most important players in professional basketball. He's more confident than ever for one reason: He has become one of the most complete superstars in the game.  As Embiid enters his prime, he's the centerpiece on both ends of the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers, who have become a legitimate threat to win it all.  No center has won the MVP award since Shaquille O'Neal in 1999-2000 for the Los Angeles Lakers. That drought should end this year, with both Embiid and Nikola Jokic making strong cases and reminding us that big men still matter. Not only does Embiid rank third in the league in scoring this season, but he also anchors one of the best defenses in the league, a key claim that Jokic cannot make.  Entering Thursday, the Sixers have the best record in the East, and Embiid is the biggest reason for that. Consider this:   In the 1,457 minutes he's been on the court this season, Philadelphia has a monstrous net rating of plus-12.0.  In the 1,693 minutes he's been on the bench this season, Philadelphia has a net rating of minus-0.3.  Embiid has had a breakout season, and while his place in the MVP race might dominate podcast conversations, that's just a distraction -- the real story here is Embiid and the new-look 76ers appear to be evolving into one of the most sustainable contenders in the NBA.  The arrivals of Daryl Morey and Doc Rivers signified the beginning of a new era in Philadelphia. Together, they've overhauled the vibes around Embiid and Ben Simmons. Morey quickly traded Al Horford and added good shooters like Seth Curry and Danny Green, while Rivers refreshed the actions and the rotations.  The result has been a more cohesive, more spacey ecosystem, which has cleared out the clutter and enabled Embiid to do what he does best. He's scoring more than ever, and he's doing so at a more efficient clip than we've ever seen from him. He's on pace to set career highs in both 2-point shooting percentage and 3-point shooting percentage. When you look at his shot chart from this season, you can see he's filling it up from all over the place.  Embiid is both more active and more efficient as a jump shooter than ever. He has both attempted and made more jumpers than anyone else on the Sixers. He's taking more than 15 jumpers per 100 possessions, up from 13.6 last season, and he's making more than 40% of them for the first time in his career.  Coming into this season, he'd struggled to achieve average 3-point shooting efficiency despite being gifted wide-open looks by defenses that dared him to shoot. But this season, Embiid has converted 36.8% of his 3.1 3-point tries per game.  That's a massive development because defenses now must honor his long-range game, which opens up other opportunities for him and his teammates elsewhere.  The bigger development has come inside the arc, where Embiid now shows off a feathery touch on midrange shots. He's attempting 11.4 non-paint 2s per 100, the highest such number among the 83 players who have tried at least 100 midrangers this season. Oh, and he's making them, too, converting 43.6% of his non-paint 2s this season. That's not only the highest such mark of his career by far, but it also changes the math on how teams must defend him away from the rim.  While his outside shooting has developed, it's his nightly performances on the low block that provide us all a reminder of the virtues of a style of play mostly left for dead in recent years. For decades, big post-up centers like Embiid dominated the NBA, but post play rapidly declined as the NBA fell in love with 3-point shots, motion offenses and faster-paced action. Post -ups happen more than 50% less frequently than they did just eight years ago.  Since the league added its player tracking system in 2013-14, post-up activity has cratered. That season, NBA teams posted up over 16.35 times per 100 possessions. This season, that figure is 8.17 times per 100.  But that staggering trend does not apply in Philly or in Denver, where the league's top two MVP candidates just happen to be dominating the league via old-school post play.  Get this: Embiid is posting up as an individual more per game than 27 other teams are collectively! Only the Lakers and Nuggets as teams are posting up more than he does.  Jokic isn't far behind, posting up more than 24 teams.  Just like the folks who have made us recently reconsider our stances on mom jeans, Embiid and Jokic are making post play cool again.  Embiid ranks first in the league, posting up 19.3 times per 100 possessions. Jokic ranks fourth, posting up 13.7 times per 100. And out of 19 players who have posted up at least 200 times this season, Jokic ranks first in efficiency, Embiid ranks second.  It's remarkable that the league's top two MVP candidates are both centers who are revising the conventional wisdom of the past 10 years: Centers were supposed to be endangered species; post play was supposed to be dying out.  Embiid is the only player in the league scoring double digits per game on post plays, and his MVP campaign is also a demonstration that the old Mikan-Russell-Chamberlain-Jabbar dance ain't dead just yet.  The pace-and-space era and the 3-point revolution have reformed the ways NBA front offices value the skills of frontcourt talent. The ability to thrive in the post on offense and defense used to be paramount. Now it isn't, and scouting reports for big men now examine their abilities to guard multiple positions, shoot from 25 feet, run the floor, grab rebounds, protect the rim, and serve up dribble-handoffs to the guards and wings they share the floor with.  As a result, the players attempting to stop the post actions of Embiid and Jokic might not be as common or as equipped to defend these actions in years past.  Just as post offense is a lost art, so is post defense. That is great news for Embiid, who is on the right side of his prime, one of the most imposing post players this league has seen in decades and still getting better. Embiid and Jokic would have thrived in any era, but in the context of the modern NBA, in which strength and size are less prioritized, there is a mouse in the house more than ever before.  As a defender himself, Embiid provides the Sixers with quite the opposite. As a 280-pound 7-footer with a 7-foot, 6-inch wingspan, he's among the league's biggest and best defenders.  The Sixers rank second in defensive efficiency in the NBA this season, giving up just 106.8 points per 100. While they decorate the defensive end with an imposing fleet of willing, savvy and sizable defenders, they play their best defense when both Simmons and Embiid are on the floor. Simmons is one of the world's most talented perimeter defenders. The combination of his point guard instincts, his defensive will and his own physical prowess make him a solid Defensive Player of the Year candidate. Meanwhile, Embiid is both an elite rim protector and rebounder.  The numbers are staggering.  Philadelphia is 32-6 in games in which Embiid and Simmons have played, a 69-win pace in a full 82-game season. In the 1,066 minutes in which they've shared the floor, Philadelphia's net rating is an absurd plus-16.2. That's the highest such mark among any two-man combo in the Eastern Conference (minimum 1,000 minutes played), and it has a lot to do with getting stops; with Embiid and Simmons on the floor, Philly's defensive rating is an eye-popping 102.2. If these guys can stay healthy, Philly's crunch-time lineups will be two-way nightmares for anyone.  At 27, it's impossible to watch Embiid and not think of former GM Sam Hinkie, and the early days of Embiid's pro career. It didn't look good. How many players miss two entire seasons of play before eventually turning into franchise players? Not many, but that's exactly how Embiid's arc began in Philly, which makes what he's doing right now even more impressive.  Along with Jokic, Embiid is making centers great again, but along with Simmons, he's also further validating the radical team-building process Hinkie designed eight years ago. No matter what happens from here on out, Embiid's eventual legacy will be tied to that polarizing tanking experiment.  No center has won the NBA MVP since Shaq did so in 1999-2000. That's about to change. Centers are relevant again, but that's not all. Basketball in Philadelphia is relevant, too. And even though Embiid might come up short on the MVP vote this season, it would be foolish to label this regular season anything short of a triumph. As a player, he has yet to reach his ceiling, but he has driven himself into the MVP conversation, and in the process, he has taken the 76ers from a punchline to the top of the Eastern Conference.  That was the plan all along."
"I dunno man, I still think giving Al Horford a near max could work."
That was a very unique dynamic to that team that played team basketball and al horford was that teams best player not milsap. Youre taking one extreme past the generalization? Nice logic. I defended the heat last year too and had you guys top 5 in the east when no one said that.
"Joel definitely came prepared this season but I think his ascent this season is more about the fit with the team than his personal level of physical fitness.    Obviously seth and danny work much better with jo and ben than horford and jrich did.  But then there‚Äôs Morey snagging an above average backup center to replace Al for the minimum (dwight‚Äôs been awesome).  It is much more satisfying to root for a smart team.  Sucks to watch your team shoot themselves in the foot, pretty sure we‚Äôve all had Billy King at one point or another.  Failure is fine, FO incompetence is enough to put you off the team if it‚Äôs not in your blood."
"Somewhere in Oklahoma, Al Horford just flinched at an imaginary missed FT"
We have the Great Value ‚Äúwash up vet who played well in OKC‚Äù player in Al Horford if you like
"To answer the Al Horford question, it is most likely that he did not get the value that Presti wanted during the trade deadline. Even though people can see him as a negative asset, it will definitely be a lot easier to trade him during the offseason with more time and the remainder of the year off his contract. Will it happen? I am not sure, but I have seen Presti pull magic out of his ass numerous times. If he gets injured during the time period between the deadline and end of season, that little value immediately goes out of the window.  It was stated in the article that the team was going to look for options for him after the season ends, but at this point, the best option for the team is playing Moses Brown, who we recently signed, and see what we can get."
Didn't the same thing happen when Al Horford left?
"Yeah, I don‚Äôt understand why people think we should be fined because we sat Al Horford. Despite everyone saying we are tanking (which we are), OKC made it clear to the league that Al Horford wants to sit because he doesn‚Äôt want to play and we are moving toward a ‚Äúplayer development‚Äù path.  If Horford suddenly came out and said, ‚ÄúOKC lied, I want to play right now‚Äù, then please, fine OKC to the moon. But he has not done that.   Besides, the Raptors got fined because of communication issues, not because of tanking. If the team, the league, and the players have full communication with each other, I don‚Äôt see why fines should be implemented in the first place, whether it be OKC or Detroit."
OKC has one named Al Horford. I'm sure they would accomodate that trade! Lol.
"Al Horford? He had a sick block on Giannis in the 2019 playoffs, but idk if that play is considered popular."
They can bring either Al Horford to come out of the bench and mentor the young guns; or KAt. Why not both? Both are Dominicans and NYC has the biggest amount of Dominican immigrants in the US. KAT is also from NYC. I can see it working.
Kawhi and Al Horford same calibre of player tbh
"I mean he was a bad fit on the Sixers, but Al Horford is definitely better than Drummond"
"Kemba and Hayward were All-NBA players when we signed them, and Kemba is easily movable should we need to go down that route, look at Al Horford last year.   But re the Knicks, there have been strong rumors that DeRozan and the Knicks have mutual interest and that's the exact type of player you sign if you are content to get your team to 45 wins and nothing more, not if you want to actually win a championship and go deep in the playoffs."
"Player development and tanking is not, and never will be, mutually exclusive. Framing it that way is weird. You're tanking, and you're entire sub knows it. Look at the comments on many posts, hoping for higher draft picks etc. No one cares at all, people are only mad because Hinkie got pushed out of the league for clearly tanking when the Thunder are doing the same thing.   I mean, the fact that the Thunder took on the worst contract in the league in Al Horford follows the Hinkie model: take the worst contracts in the league because of your huge cap space, and swindle picks out of teams for dumping those contracts. Then sitting them. Don't sugar coat it."
Well for starters you could call Al Horford back from Cancun to play basketball.
"I know it's hard for you to understand, but the Thunder really are interested in developing the players that they are testing out right now. That's literally the point of resting Al Horford. He's 100% gone next year, so we might as well see if Moses Brown or Bradley is any good. We would be doing it even if we were in Houston's spot - guaranteed #1 lottery odds. And as Icarpet noted, Bazely, Poku, Maledon, Roby, Kenrich, and Ty Jerome will 100% be back next year and we are using this time to develop them. You haven't been paying attention to the Thunder at all. You just buy into this narrative that everything the Thunder have done is tanking. It's not. Certainly tanking is part of it, but there's a lot more nuance here, just like there is in Detroit. Literally same GM tree.  And keep putting that tinfoil hat on about ""excuses"" with Shai and Dort's injuries. They are real. Just because we are tanking, doesn't mean players can't get hurt."
"Did the NBA suddenly force Iguodala to play during that time period when he refused to? Did they NBA force Memphis to do something about the situation? If they did, please remind me because I do not remember all the events during that time period.  If the NBA or team did not do anything to force Iguodala to play when they wanted him to, why do we have to force Al Horford to play when Horford doesn‚Äôt want to as well? Sure, the situations of the team are different, but it‚Äôs still a player who doesn‚Äôt want to play and both teams wanted to make a decision that benefits them better."
"You would still be forcing a player to play when he doesn‚Äôt want to.   Sure, OKC is not playing good basketball right now, but I rather see players such as Moses Brown and Tony Bradley instead of forcing Al Horford, who doesn‚Äôt want to play anymore, to suit up."
"I‚Äôve said this before, but Ainge has gone through three separate rebuilds since the big three but nobody even noticed because he managed to keep the team in the conference finals every other year anyways.   He built the IT team out of Al Horford and spare parts that other teams were using as salary filler to complete trades. But that team topped out at the conference finals and he moved on.  Then he built a different team around a big three of Kyrie/Hayward/Horford. Hayward‚Äôs leg exploded game one, then Kyrie needed surgery, and that team never got off the ground.   Then he pivoted to a team built around Tatum and Brown and made another conference finals immediately. And our two stars are locked up long term and both under 25, while the team just got out of the repeater tax and will have the flexibility to make serious moves to stay in contention the next few years."
"What kind of revisionist history is this? Brandon Bass and Gilbert Arenas were supposed to step up and be his number 2 guys against Joe Johnson, AL Horford, and Josh Smith?   Dwight averaged 27/15.5.    Ouside of game 1 where scored 46 of his teams 93 points he didn't have a team mate score more 17 games in the series. Wilt Chamberlin would have had the same issue."
He‚Äôs had a good season but Al Horford is still a bad contract
al horford flinching after a brick vibe
"I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. She started watching in 2012, and watched her team play 8 years of top level basketball (or at least playoff level) but as soon as they have 3/4 of a bad season she can‚Äôt take it anymore? It‚Äôs too much? So spoiled this is a ridiculously out of touch post. 14 teams miss playoffs every year, and 34 year al horford isn‚Äôt the difference between then missing playoffs and them getting blown out as a 10th seed in the play in.   This just comes off as being a fair weather fan. And even then, okc are in a great position thanks to Sam presti. Imagine if she had been a kings fan instead."
"Bro u ain't what u think u is. Since when have the Hawks been that much better than the Hornets?  This ain't 2009 anymore. Joe Johnson, Jsmoove, Al Horford ain't walking through the door.üòÇü§£"
"this is the damn facts. rebuilding i don‚Äôt mind. trading everything that‚Äôs nailed down for future assets can be a great idea. but there‚Äôs a difference between truly rebuilding from the ground up like the process sixers and actively throwing games like OKC is doing now. SGA is one of the only bright spots this fan base has right now and they won‚Äôt let him play. for what? so that they might pick top 4 instead of top 5? al horford is well known for being a character guy who ‚Äúplays the right way.‚Äù him getting on the court gives the kids something to learn from. the kids aren‚Äôt getting that now.  for the vast, vast majority of sports fans, sports are not ‚Äúchampionship or bust.‚Äù they are ‚Äúhey, i got tickets for the thunder game this weekend, wanna go?‚Äù they are ‚Äúhey, wanna come over and watch the game?‚Äù they are ‚Äúhey, can we get the game on one of the tvs?‚Äù and you can have that experience with a bad team. but a team that is throwing games and hiding healthy players? nah.  the fans pay the bills and you owe it to the people who paid to watch the game to give your best effort with the players you have."
"I care because it sets a terrible precedent, but more importantly because there are rules.  Rules that others have broken and been fined for.  No I wasn't watching OKC games, but I know Al Horford can make a team better when you're fielding random G League scrubs."
OKC is paying al horford to chill at his house this year. If they wanted to they could have made a run at the play in
Whose paying tickets to see Al Horford
Al Horford is a 5x all star
Al Horford üòÇ
"No one batted an eye when we sat Al Horford out after the trade deadline, but suddenly everyone loses their shit when we lose games and fall closer to second worst record"
TIL: Al Horford recently became a mother üòÖ
"Some of these folks doesn't know how much a bitch a plantar fasciitis is. And the case of Horford sitting out, both parties agreed. Bazley's injury was a scapula related one. Dort, hip contusions from too much bumping into screens (he needs those pads like Carmelo is using). Muscala agreed to sit out like Al. Poku has some injuries because his body can't handle the bigger bumps yet.   What the team is doing after the All-Star is checking out the role players and aee who is worth keeping or extending, and who is worth waiving/trading."
How can they bench Al Horford without getting fined?
Al Horford was not benched for being injured. SGA should be healthy by now but we have not received updates.
"I mean, they‚Äôre intentionally tanking and literally sat Al Horford for no reason. Why wouldn‚Äôt they lie about an injury so they don‚Äôt have to play one of their three good players?"
Yup it's so hypocritical that the league isn't doing anything about it. Straight up told a healthy Al Horford to chill. Milking the shit out of Shai's injury. Had Ariza home half the year before they traded him.
"Looks like I put a ton of work into this but I copied and pasted something. I guess he was no lock because the Cavs were struggling, but statistically he was having a better season than other reserve big men (averaged 14-14-3.5 back when those were really good numbers and was known as a good defender)  [https://www.fearthesword.com/2012/12/6/3732814/anderson-varejao-all-star](https://www.fearthesword.com/2012/12/6/3732814/anderson-varejao-all-star) (Cavs source)  Marc Stein ESPN (paragraph below) [http://www.espn.com/nba/dailydime/\_/page/dime-130118-19/nba-2013-all-star-reserve-picks](http://www.espn.com/nba/dailydime/_/page/dime-130118-19/nba-2013-all-star-reserve-picks)  The Olympian (Tyson Chandler) has long been considered one of the most impactful defenders in the game, which is key for the Knicks given their increasing struggles at that end, but he's also averaging an uberefficient 12.4 points and 11.0 rebounds on 67 percent shooting from the floor in addition to his role as New York's emotional compass.  And Noah isn't far off that standard, averaging 12.4 points, 10.7 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 2.0 blocks to A) thrust himself into the heart of the defensive player of the year race and, more importantly, B) relentlessly and hyperactively lead the Bulls through life without Rose along with coach Tom Thibodeau.  It only figures, furthermore, that there are several more centers to consider in this category now that, according to the ballot, we're supposed to be de-emphasizing positions like we're all Erik Spoelstra. Brooklyn's [Brook Lopez](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3448/brook-lopez), Atlanta's [Al Horford](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3213/al-horford) and Miami's [Chris Bosh](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1977/chris-bosh) \-- who, yes, counts as a center on the smallish Heat no matter how Spoelstra is labeling him these days -- all have a strong case, **as Varejao would have if he hadn't gotten hurt.**"
"I agree the list is BS, and Jokic definitely raised his chances after winning the MVP. I think Al Horford is debatable. He's an excellent role player, but he probably shouldnt be in the HOF."
"That the 76ers got better by replacing Jimmy Butler and JJ Reddick for Al Horford and Josh Richardson.  Nobody would admit to it now, but that was dare I say... an overwhelming consensus opinion heading into the 2019-20 season."
Don‚Äôt forget Al Horford
Hinkie wasn‚Äôt allowed to see his process through. A big part of it is amassing assets and having flexibility. Does Hinkie go out and get Tobias Harris or Al Horford? Does he keep Simmons or does he sell high on him? Does he draft Fultz?  There are so many things that could have gone differently since Hinkie was forced out in 2016. To use this current roster as proof that the process failed is incredibly short-sighted.
"Yeah. Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver, and Jeff Teague. Catch the fever lol"
Al Horford ducking all the way from OKC watching Ben
Sixers need a guy like Al Horford‚Ä¶
"Just throw a golden oldies squad out there:  **Guards:** Kyle Lowry, Rajon Rondo, George Hill, Wes Matthews, Lou Williams, JJ Redick.  **Forwards:** Andre Iguodala, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Millsap, PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, Jared Dudley, Al Horford.   **Centres:** Dwight Howard, Taj Gibson.  Lowry, Redick, Iguodala, Melo, Dwight.   Rondo, Matthews, Tucker, Millsap, Horford.   Hill, Lou Will, Ariza, Dudley, Gibson."
"Not going to tell you you are wrong or anything, but this bit:  &gt;And these stats were not due to lack of shooters, they ranked 14th in three point percentage and 12th in free throw percentage.  Not elite numbers, but also **good enough that you'd think the quantity could and should be raised.**  is not the right way to use stats. Increasing the volume at which you take a shot often means the efficiency suffers. Being able to shoot the three decently doesn't mean a player or team will hit at the same rate if they start taking more of them. Or that other parts of their game won't suffer. Just look at Al Horford in Philly."
not playing al horford was blatant tanking
"he tried to thread the needle of ""compete while developing"" and has failed. Steven Adams and Bledsoe have been horrific. Keeping George Hill would have been amazing for them to help their lack of spacing. Acquiring Al Horford would have been such a natural fit with Zion on both ends."
"LeBron‚Äôs back was fucked in that series/whole 2014-2015 season, I thought bro time was about to end like Larry Bird‚Äôs. Plus Iggy was fouling the hell out of him lmaooo. I think if LeBron was healthy, that could‚Äôve been a game 7 series. But in retrospect I truly think the Cavs shouldn‚Äôt have traded for Kevin Love &amp; actually went for Al Horford. Kevin Love isn‚Äôt a 16 game player due to his low motor, durability &amp; defensive limitations. They possibly could‚Äôve got Paul Millsap in that trade too due to major hype Wiggins had in that upcoming draft &amp; got off of Anderson Varejao contract."
The Al Horford shit has me rooting against OKC in the lottery
"Bucks   The 2018 Celtics without Kyrie or Hayward took the Cavs to 7. They were led by Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Rookie Tatum and young Brown  Hell the Pacers took the Cavs to 7 and they were led by Oladipo lol  Meanwhile this Bucks team has a 2 time MVP and DPOY with 2 other stars and shooters around him"
Maybe you‚Äôre interested in Al Horford? :-)
"If I remember correctly, Al Horford played him pretty tough in a couple playoff series."
"Are we really going to pretend that a team with Al Horford as their best player was ever, in a million years, going to win a championship?"
Al Horford is washed and if you'd take him on your team's roster over Draymond at $24m then would deserve to be fired as GM.  But bottom line Draymond's contract is a good deal for the Warriors.
"Oh yeah, Brook Lopez is not Al Horford, but hes not gonna get 40 dropped on him"
"I don't get why people take these rankings so personally when it's mostly who contributes to winning teams. Two seasons ago Jokic was 18 on SI's 100 best and Al Horford was 16... now one is MVP and the other is getting paid to stay home. You can find dumb takes with hindsight all over the place but narratives change.  But the way a lot of this discussion goes is like people saying Booker was trash two years ago when that just wasn't the case. It was a lot of he's a good player on a bad team and doesn't play defense. We've seen a lot of those example players be shit when paired with a good team and a lot of them take a step higher. Monta have it all, remember?"
"Trade Kemba for the corpse of Al Horford, pick up Lonzo.. Sixers/Nets in 4 still!"
name all the players you want but let me tell you smth. i used to have an al horford poster in my room and i swear i caught my gf looking at it while we were fucking and i dont blame her.
Jarrett Allen. Dude is gonna get paid like Al Horford.
"Doesn't mean they don't still win in 2017 and/or 2018. Maybe it just means they do it with Barnes, or another free agent like Al Horford instead."
~~Misery~~  1) Trade Hield for a veteran on a big contract(Al Horford)   2) Send Bagley to Houston for a couple of 2nds   3) Tank this year and target Banchero or Pat Baldwin Jr. in the draft
I actually hated it not the best with Al horford and getting swept by the Celtics
"People keep saying this but the 76ers also got back a starter in Danny Green for al horford. We could not have offered something like Green, I doubt we could have gotten horford."
"You're not addressing 2016 at all. Westbrook played like shit games 5-7, but KD had multiple opportunities to close out the series and solidify himself.    A 2017 Cavs-Warriors rematch would've been near even. The Cavs lacked defense, and they wouldn't have blown out the Warriors if they didn't have KD. OKC would've had the same assets to make a trade for Oladipo/Sabonis and flip for PG AND get Al Horford. A lineup up Westbrook/KD/PG/Adams/Horford would absolutely be a contender. 2019 would've been won if Klay Thompson didn't get injured at all even with KD out. 30 points in 30 minutes in game 6 about to force a game 7? Come on, how are you going to call yourself a Warriors fan when you don't even give credit to your own team."
"They easily could have taken George Hill and Al Horford instead of Bledsoe and Adams upon getting their transaction with OKC. 2 great vets who would have helped a young team with even better fit around Zion, Ingram and Zo.  But I guess Griff and SVG loved the idea of pairing Zion and Steven Adams bc they extended Adams right as they got him ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è fucking bozos"
"It makes sense that an elite combo guard like Lillard or harden is the best fit possible for embiid. But Its funny that Simmons and Embiid's fit isn't an issue so thats fixing something that isn't a problem. Simmons and Embiid with all of their supposed fit issues play the best together and are an elite duo according to advanced statistics every year. Simmons' intangibles might actually carry him to elite levels of production. I guess all of his coaches might be right in that he's elite because his combination of defense and passing is second to none. Him leading the league in assisted three pointers while having Al horford, josh Richardson and Tobias as his shooters proved that."
Wdym you dont want al Horford?
Where‚Äôs Al Horford when you need him
This nuggets team is still better than that sixers team last year. Put Jokic next to Al Horford and see how he does
He was considered one when he ran into Celtics Al Horford
Dwight Howard was the Al Horford we were promised
"That‚Äôs great! A DPOY doesn‚Äôt get you into the Hall. See: Alonzo Mourning.  Neither does 50 fucking wins. Again, see Joe Johnson and Al Horford.  No need to make it personal. I‚Äôm making the case against him. In my opinion, there shouldn‚Äôt even BE a case against a HOFer. It should be a no brainer. Ben Wallace is not that, sir."
"I‚Äôm genuinely not. I think the bar is set too low for the basketball HOF. I really like Ben as a player. But come on. He‚Äôs not the type of player to change the fortunes of a franchise.  Four all-star games. You know who else made 4+ all-star games? Joe Johnson. Amare Stoudemire. Al Horford.   Ben belongs in the ‚ÄúHall of Very Good,‚Äù not the HOF."
Lost Al Horford and Josh Richardson...pretty different
Bro you guys just straight up gave Al Horford half the year off because you didn‚Äôt want to win
Another team might sign Schroeder just to get off the Lakers. Remember the Sixers‚Äô contract to Al Horford? That was almost more about getting him off Boston then getting Horford himself.
Al Horford
"Al Horford, Marc Gasol, Draymond... Basically smart defensive players. They know that he can't really be shut down but they know how to force him into tougher shots."
"how about Pat Bev (expiring), Ibaka (expiring/injured), and 25th pick to OKC, Kennard and Morris to Boston, Kemba and Al Horford to Clips."
Marc Gasol  The duo of Looney and Draymond (mostly Draymond)  Raptors  Al Horford  Bam
"He did get Al Horford to bite on pump fakes a couple years ago because he fluked 40% shooting for the series, I assume that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs trying and horribly failing to get now. Also Kawhi played way up on him in the Raptors series, but that‚Äôs how Kawhi plays everyone no matter how well they shoot."

"For now.

"They disrespected D-Rose, ain‚Äôt no way he‚Äôs behind Al Horford in his chance at the HoF"
yeah with al horford on the team?
He has David Robinsons Body but Al Horford's playstyle. What initially pointed me towards this comparison was the fact that it was so hard to find other centers who get to the free throw line as little as Ayton does and Al Horford is one of the few that do.
"  I have respect for almost all great athletes, but in terms of personal heroes, I only have a few. My all time personal hero is Bill Russell. I have read all of his books, watched everyone old highlight reel of his out there and am a deep believer in what he stands for. A more modern personal hero of my in recent years has been Jaylen Brown. Another guy up there for me is Big Papi. Xander Bogearts, and Al Horford probably round out the top 5 of my personal heroes. I like Phil Mickelson, but he is more of the Tom Brady kinda of guy I like. Mostly the on field/course personality. I wouldn‚Äôt go as far to say I enjoy all of their off course/field beliefs and issues. Whether that is political alignment, or Phil Mickelson‚Äôs insider trading scandal."
Al Horford matched and raised what Chandler Parsons did
"If it were to happen this summer (which seems extremely unlikely since the date for the expansion draft was announced about 70 days in advanced in '04 with the Bobcats) and I were running the Mavs, I would strongly consider not protecting KP for two reasons.  First, the way things stand now, we can't make any big moves in free agency unless we renounced THJ's $28.5m cap hold and thus lose his Bird Rights.  Freeing up space lets us make a splash in free agency (perhaps Lonzo) while keeping THJ's Bird Rights and retaining him as well.  Second, if KP gets picked, you get a trade exception equal to his contract.  With that, you could take in Al Horford (to replace KP) for nothing and maybe even get a protected 1st back as well!"
"If you have David Robinsons body and AL horford mind/game, you're basically naming an all time talent"
"OKC is a team I think of: Boston would probably love to get Al Horford back and they could probably steal a pick as well. Plus, if he plays well enough they can flip him either next season or the one after (as an expiring deal)."
"ben and perkins cancel each other out, correct? al horford = thabo   but yeah i think you got me here although josh richardson is quite literally getting DNP'd in the playoffs and was starting last year!"
"Huh? How does starting Smart ruin our forward framework? We obviously need to add size to this team, which is why I‚Äôm not giving you names of point guards to add. I don‚Äôt want to invest in point guard. I don‚Äôt want to invest in Kemba Walker. I am good with a Smart, Brown, Tatum backcourt and adding size instead. I can give you almost a dozen names of players with size, because unlike point guard, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm interested in adding‚Ä¶ Larry Nance Jr, Al Horford, Kristaps Porzingis, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Morris, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Thad Young, Kyle Anderson."
"Plenty of Celtics flairs actually explained why they think Ainge and the Celtics have a ""reputation.""

Just wanna point out that the Knicks would only need to give OKC a protected future first (sometime within the next 5 years) for Al Horford. You have the cap space and wouldn't have to give anything tangible up in terms of players/prospects. He's actually a very good stretch 5 and still competent defensively
"Embiid‚Äôs teammates were al horford who didn‚Äôt even make the playoffs and J rich who didn‚Äôt even start and play for dallas, and tobias harris who is worse playoff choker than middleton. Denver has MPJ a star, AG, and Campazzo. Denver were a 3 seed and Sixers were a 6 seed. Jokic won MVP and has higher expectations, while Embiid didn‚Äôt."
Al horford? What the fuck did we do to Al horford?!
"Speaking of Al Horford, back when he was good in the Celtics, Tristan Thompson used to lock him up in the playoffs every year."
"It used to be Gasol on Embiid, but Marc's aged a ton and is washed at this point. So probably Al Horford or Steven Adams"
"&gt; OKC has no reason to buy out someone and then have $14 million in dead money sitting on their books for 2021-22 that they can't trade or unload   if they don't trade Horford, do you think they're going to keep horford in 2023 and pay his full salary rather than cut him for $14M?  That $14M is going to be dead money one way or another, unless he's traded. OKC and Al agreed he would get to approve anywhere they trade him to, so if a deal isn't there, it seems perfectly reasonable they discuss a buyout in the middle of next season, because they'd end up cutting him as soon as the new season hit anyway.  he could definitely go to BK. But we're not going to make that salary our problem just to ensure he's here lol."
"&gt;$27.5m for Al Horford?  Yup, I'll take that. Horford is still a top-tier post-passer and his ability to shoot 3s is huge for spacing"
"probably would end up being a 3 team trade. Imo what makes the most sense is a sign and trade  basically a team that has no cap space that wants to improve but can't sign a player. Boston would want a free agent and it would up being a sign and trade. who would that player be? Idk   but I can see the trade being a swap of another not so great contract, like Al Horford."
"&gt; I think Ayton‚Äôs intelligence is really underrated  That is why I said Ayton is pretty similar to an early Al Horford (not a volume scorer but gets points in the teens efficiently, good versatile defense, and just an intelligent player) but people turned that down. It is just a hard comparison to see because Al Horford isn't a freak athlete and is undersized while the opposite is true of Ayton but their play is pretty similar."
"I think it‚Äôs the pressure and diminishing role. Jaylen and Jayson being so good, so fast basically forced us into a win now mode and we have spent big on free agency acquisitions to get them help. The problem is that all the guys we get were first options previously on their teams and after a season or two they become 3rd options. Al Horford was the perfect fit everyone else saw their role diminish season after season because of Jaylen and Jayson."
"&gt; Al will get bought out this year  That's highly unlikely as he's still owed 2 years and $54 million. OKC has no incentive to buy him out with 2 years left on his deal unless Horford is willing to give back a gigantic amount of money (which is doubtful). Horford will probably be a buyout contract a year from now though, but not this season."
Spurs can just trade KP into their cap space if they want.  No need to send out salary back.  As for contracts then you're talking Kemba/Al Horford type deals.  Not sure if KP makes sense for Celtics since Tatum is a 4.  Maybe OKC takes a flyer if they get Cade Cunningham or one of the Jalens in the draft.
Kemba for Al Horford seems like the move that'll happen
"This is it. And it all started from Kyrie Irving requesting a trade from Cleveland. Any GM worth his salt would at the very least look into what they could give for a generational talent, and most would try to make a trade happen.  So Danny did, I think (and this statement is just speculation on my part) before he had known what he had in Jaylen and Jayson. Now you've got Kyrie Irving and Al Horford on your team. You are going to try and compete.  When, in my opinion and with the obvious benefit of hindsight, the best move from the jump would have been to officially enter a rebuilding stage around the Jays. But the front office didn't know what the Jay's would become, and they were always told that ""We compete every year."" So the Celtics overstretched themselves and tried to go all the way every season since 2018 without realizing that their real centerpieces were those two kids they just drafted.  That led to mediocre performances and growing pains that manifested themselves as locker room issues and of course, the max-players and free-agents are going to take the brunt of the pain, both in terms of their performance and the blame from the media/fans.  That's my opinion on the Celtics struggles since 2018. Trying to pin this on any given player or individual is missing the bigger picture. The overarching problem is that we tried to compete when we should have been developing and if you play like that then every year when you should be ""winning it all"" is going to be a disappointment, and someone is always going to be blamed."
"The Celtics are giving up a lottery protected first to get off his contract, not getting one.  See Horford, Al."
"There is no way Horford is a factor in OKC‚Äôs long term plans. They‚Äôre looking to build a core that will content 3+ years from now, Al will be retired at the time.  Swapping Al for Kemba would be a net positive for them even if picks weren‚Äôt involved, they get a younger more tradable asset"
Al Horford is the only one I can think of
"There was. Horford went on record saying if he knew Kemba was coming, his decision would probably be different.   &gt; As far as on the court, it‚Äôs certain Horford wasn‚Äôt interested in playing another hand from the same deck. I asked him if his decision would have been different if Irving had remained.  &gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure that has anything to do with it for me,‚Äù Horford said. ‚ÄúI just think that if Kyrie would have stayed, I don‚Äôt know if it would have worked. There would have had to be some major changes as far as players, because it was just clear that the group that we had just wasn‚Äôt going to be able to coexist.‚Äù  &gt; And what about if he‚Äôd known Kemba Walker was coming. Horford paused.  &gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get caught up in the past,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut, yeah, that would have been totally different.‚Äù  https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/10/09/al-horford-finds-hope-in-philly-after-celtics-crash/"
"$24m is a fucking bargain for a guy who still the best help defender in the league, one of the best overall defenders in the league, a guy who isn't just a great individual defender but tells his whole team where to be, calls out sets and coverages, etc.   It's a fucking bargain when that guy is also one of the best passing/play-making bigs in the league, not that far from LeBron in assist percentage (i.e. he's the guy racking up most of the assists while on the floor, helped by some Curry gravity of course).   Would you rather be paying...  $27.5m for Al Horford?  $31m for Kevin Love?  $28.5m for Otto Porter?  $19.2 for Gary Harris?  $36.6m for Blake Griffin (his salary this season before being bought out)  $15m for Andre Iguodala?  $17m for Rickey Rubio?  $24m for LMA, his salary before his heart issues forced him into early retirement?  Here, I'll even get controversial, is Russell Westbrook at $41m really more valuable than Draymond at $24m?  Draymond's extension was 100% team friendly."
"&gt; I'm not sure what use the clippers have for him though.  Kennard's '22 salary + Pat Bev's expiring contract add up to $29 million.  Could be used to trade for a disgruntled vet like Kevin Love, Al Horford, maybe even KP if the Mavs change course and decide to move him.  I'm not saying that that's likely but it's one way his salary can be used.  Clips have their '21 1st round pick and a boatload of early 2nds to sweeten any potential deals.  I actually like Kennard as a player.  He seems to have gotten over the bi-lateral knee tendinitis that slowed his development in Detroit.  I feel like he could be a Joe Harris type player in a couple years but with more playmaking ability."
"Tatum couldn't beat Milwaukee with Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Marcus Smart and Al Horford, with Brad Stevens as a coach. Cope how you want, Embiid is better. OH, and Luka will ALWAYS be a better player than Trash Young."
Definitely not Al Horford.
"To a degree yeah, but based on things that Tim has been very open about, this is how it's done in the playoffs. Vendettas, the whole 9. Everyone on this sub should read up on the scandal and listen the pods made about it. You'll never look at the league the same way. I know I don't. No one is saying Embiid isn't good...he's VERY good...and I'm a very realistic fan. I expected him to cook us. But not like that. Not on touch fouls. That's what frustrates me. Not even pick n roll fouls like Trae (everyone runs the p&amp;r like that so, it is what it is) but some damn near non existent fouls. 2 teams. Different styles. If they let them play, we lose. Badly. If they call it close equally on both sides, we win. We're a finesse team. The climate om Friday is going to be even chippier because of how Inconsistent they've been. I called back in 2016 that someone would be ejected Hawks v Cavs and low and behold Al Horford was ejected (I have receipts). If the game starts out with Atlanta getting a big lead on Friday, they'll start to call it closer and someone will likely get booted or a tech at the least. TBH, Embiid should have been booted for what he did. But the NBA has clearly shown they will not eject a superstar player; Draymond was not a superstar, especially compared to LeBron, for anyone who brings that one up...."
"there's 15-20 NBA teams that would've killed to have Ainge as the GM or to get even one of Tatum/Brown, let alone both.  Also everyone loves to forget that Ainge hit on Smart, Robert Williams, Al Jefferson, Rajon Rondo and more.  Oh yeah, he hired Brad Stevens, too.  The Kemba Walker contract was fine last year when he was an all-star but is aging poorly and unfortunately will continue to do so, and losing Kyrie for nothing hurts even if they didn't really give up that much to get him.  Horford looked cooked in Philly and Hayward was hurt again for a good chunk of this year (his contract also has a significant chance of being onerous by the end), all the hand wringing about him is pretty overblown and his credentials as a top GM are bona-fide.  Anyhow it's over now, the Jazz are very much not dead and I hope they beat the Clippers, I respect the hell out of Quin Snyder and Dennis Lindsey for putting together this roster &amp; getting the most out of them."
"a post and mid range scorer thrives when not playing SF next to al horford, joel embiid and ben simmons  easy to see why"
"I‚Äôll honestly take him for Kemba.   I think he hasn‚Äôt necessarily been utilised well but I don‚Äôt blame Carlisle when you have a generational talent like Luka.  I feel like he can be an Al Horford like player if we get the right coaches around him and KP + Timelord is a great big lineup for offense/Defense mixup.  His age profile also matches the Jays more. That contract is yikes though. Injuries aren‚Äôt the greatest look either, but there are certainly worse moves we can make."
...like LeBron played in a tough East? The East LeBron played in post 2013 was maybe the weakest it had been ever. Only the early 2000s compared. LeBron is great but look at his CF opponents from those years. Jeff Teague and Al Horford won 60 games. DeMar and Kyle Lowry and a 21 year old Jayson Tatum were LeBrons biggest roadblocks to the Finals.
"Man who had the most assisted 3 pointers at 6'10 on a team with Josh Richardson, Al horford and Tobias Harris as his shooters is not good enough"
I've been on this train since the 2018 playoffs after watching a young af Celtics team who's best player at the time was Al Horford beat the Bucks in 7. I'm posting it now because it's relevant to the NBA and it's a major talking point
"Yes, a team with Al Horford as its best player could have won the title with a different coach"
"It's a gamble for sure, IMO the best move would be a slight downward move on a shorter contract, NBA trade simulator says Al Horford gives the Mavs +5 wins over KP (not sure I buy it but it clearly isn't that terrible of a downgrade) and if he sucks you can buy him out or try and trade his expiring after only a year. Again normally not safe to bet on FA but they have a perennial all star that might attract players to want to come team up with but I genuinely do not know. I really don't think the Mavs want to put Luka in a situation like Dame where even though they make the playoffs they aren't going anywhere."
"KP for Al horford, at least his deal is a year shorter and with the value of expiring contacts you could look to get rid of him after one season instead of being stuck with KP for 3. Normally I would agree you don't want to make moves like that but IMO he's a better true center and if I was Cuban I wouldn't want to waste any of Lukas contract."
"Take it with a grain of salt   Morey got rid of Al Horford on a big contract, and there's always a team that's *just on the cusp* of being a contender that might make a deal close to the trade deadline"
"Yeah for fans that wants to win now, trading Porzingis for an aging washed Kemba who‚Äôs trash on defense or a washed Al Horford is not gonna make this team a contender or even better. Even if it clears up cap a year early, there‚Äôs no guarantee anyone will sign a max in Dallas, they‚Äôve never attracted a single star free agent before. They need to add someone and run it back, not trade Porzingis at his absolute lowest value."
"SGA is probably the best player on OKC, second best is probably either Dort or Al Horford, depending how you see it."
"Is our second best player right now Al Horford? Porzingis health is always a question mark, but probably"
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
Al Horford for KP and a second rounder. Who says no?
Al Horford and Mike Muscala? KP will net a return lol
"They're not but are a tier above the other maybes and I'd be shocked if they weren't at least in the play-ins. Unclear how good Al Horford will be at 35 and OKC only played him half a season, Kemba was rough but without him they need to find a new point guard, and they have a first time head coach. I expect Celtics will be good (and I'm a fan of the Jays) but they can't get into the obvious 1-6 because there are too many ways that they could get worse."
"They hate Kyrie cuz he was a flop and he lied to them about wanting to stay. If you have the memory to go 2 years back you‚Äôll remember that the cities favorite player Isaiah Thomas, was black. Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Al Horford, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett all are black. No they don‚Äôt hate Kylie cuz he‚Äôs black they hate him cuz he ditched them."
"When he was assitant coach with the Hawks he had a knack for developing a more consistent three pointer for our wings and our bigs. Paul Millsap, Al Horford, and Demarre Carrol all developed a consistent 3pt shot in Atlanta under Atkinson's watch. The previous years those three players all shot less than one a game.  I'd also contend that guys like Millsap, Teague, Horford, Carrol, and even Hardaway had some of their best defensive years in Atlanta which can be attributed to both Bud and Atkinson."
Al Horford was traded for 1 first round pick last off season. He had around $85M left on his contract. I think you‚Äôre vastly overstating the negative value that Bledsoe is at 1 year $18M with another year of a $4M guarantee
"In addition to making the playoffs and 50+ wins out West, Dirk made ASGs int he West going up against a ton of great bigs/forwards. Competition was so good that Dirk missed All Star Games while averaging: 22/9/2 ('01), 17/7/3 ('13), 18/7/2 ('16)  Aside from the first season, none of those seasons pop out as all time great seasons, but they were still solid numbers, in the West he didn't come close to the ASG, but in the East I'm sure he makes the ASG 2 or maybe even all 3 times with those numbers. Dirk was making all star games and all NBA teams while going up against prime Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett.   For reference the years he missed the ASG while putting up those numbers, Eastern conference bigs who got in were averaging:   * 2001: Dirk averaged 22/9/2    * Anthony Mason averaged 16/10/3    * Glenn Robinson averaged 22/7/3    * Lattrell Sprewell averaged 18/5/4    * Allan Houston averaged 19/4/2    * Antonio Davis averaged 14/10/1 * 2013: Dirk averaged 17/7/3    * Luol Deng averaged 17/6/3    * Brook Lopez averaged 19/7/2    * Kevin Garnett averaged 15/8/2    * Chris Bosh averaged 17/7/2 * 2016: Dirk averaged 18/7/2    * Paul Millsap averaged 17/9/3    * Al Horford averaged 15/7/3    * Pau Gasol averaged 17/11/4    * Andre Drummond averaged 15/14/1"
"Counter point if Steph Curry and Al Horford did the fusion dance like in dragon ball z, is that player the GOAT?"
We‚Äôre talking about Al Horford
Al Horford‚Ä¶
Lmao OKC literally gave *up* assets for Al Horford and a top 6 protected first  less than a year ago.   You gotta watch some more NBA transactions my guy. This is like the most common move in basketball lmao. They just did it AGAIN like a month ago with Kemba Walker!!
Here's a list of all stars that were drafted by small market teams in the past 20 years (MVPs in bold):  * Zion * Donovan Mitchell * Bam * Sabonis * KAT * LaVine * **Jokic** * Oladipo * **Giannis** * Gobert * AD * Lillard * Drummond * Middleton * Kyrie * Kemba * Vucevic * Kawhi * Isaiah Thomas * Cousins * Hawyward * PG * **Harden** * Tyreke Evans * **WB** * Love * Hibbert * Lopez * Dragic * **Durant** * Conley * Roy * Rondo * Lowry * Millsap * Bogut * Deron * CP3 * Granger * Dwight * Emeka Okafor * Deng * Jameer Nelson * **Lebron** * Melo * Wade * David West * Mo Williams * Kyle Korver * Amare * Caron Butler * Boozer  Here are those drafted by big markets (top 10: https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2020/)  * Trae * Tatum * Ben Simmons * Ingram * Jaylen Brown * Porzingis * D'Angelo Russell * Embiid * Randle * Siakam (I think Toronto is a pretty damn big market) * Beal * Dray * Klay * Butler * Wall * Griffin * **Steph** * DeRozan * Jrue Holiday * Jeff Teague * Rose * DeAndre Jordan * Horford * Noah * Gasol * Aldridge * Bynum * Lee * Devin Harris * Iguodala * Al Jefferson * Bosh * Kaman * Josh Howard * Yao Ming  **A lot more all stars and a lot more superstars were drafted by small market teams.**
Nah. Al horford. Simmons would get cooked lol
"Body somewhere between Al Horford and Joakim Noah right there. He does have vert, you obviously didn't watch film."
"In the 2007 championship game, freshman Greg Oden arguably outdueled Florida juniors Al Horford and Joakim Noah, both of whom had already won a title and both of whom went on to be multi-time NBA All-Stars. And I mean Oden outdueled the two of them *combined* ([box score](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/2007-04-02-florida.html)).   Greg Oden: 25 pts, 12 rebs (4 offensive), 4 blocks, 1 steal, 10-for-15 FG  Horf+Noah: 26 pts, 15 rebs (4 offensive), 2 blocks, 1 steal, 7-for-18 FG"
Actually he wasn‚Äôt lying at all. He literally told everybody when al horford was going weeks before it happened. And kawhi said he was close to going to the lakers and clippers was forced to trade for pg or else
"Lol a 2018 all-star? You mean like Lamarcus Aldridge, Victor Oladipo, Al Horford, John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, and Kevin Love? How is being a 2018 all-star relevant at this point?"
Not in order  1. Love 2. Bledsoe 3. Kemba 4. Gobert 5. John Wall 6. Horford 7. Buddy Hield 8. Harrison Barnes 9. Eric Gordon 10. Joe Harris 11. Steven Adams 12. Davis Bertans 13. Gary Harris 14. Rubio 15. Marcus Morris 16.Terrence Ross 17. Malik Beasley 18. KCP 19. Al-Farouq Aminu 20. DeAndre Jordan
Bruce Brown and Al Horford? McCollum is their secondary play maker and a critical role in how they function... I don't see them making that trade imo
"Yeah, the Blazers have done a terrible job of getting talent around Dame and CJ. The Evan Turner contract was an example of something that made no sense to me. You could have signed someone like Harrison Barnes, Al Horford, Boogie, etc."
"If you paid attention during the first half of the season, we did‚Äîand we were doing quite well.  Then SGA got injured (plantar fasciitis‚Äîan injury that requires rest and actively gets worse if you put more workload on it) and we went all-in from there.  What were we supposed to do: risk SGA‚Äôs health to push for the play-in game during a season where the home stadium was empty? Try to stay competitive during the last third of the season and see how many wins a big three of Al Horford, Lu Dort, and fresh-from-the-G-League rookie Aleksej Pokusevski can get?"
"Hear me out, al horford Marcus smart and big tack."
"Even Brook Lopez was only a 34% 3pt shooter this year  I think Al Horford still fits the bill, although his defense isn't what it was.  Turner shot 33.5% so he's meh  Embiid is definitely the best at both, comparatively speaking."
Al Horford 4-5 years ago?
"Kinda funny how aggressive your getting for no reason. Also the mavs haven't gotten free agents on par of gordon Hayward or al Horford, or KG, or Ray allen"
Why would he be compared to Al Horford?
Kyrie was traded for and he couldnt wait to leave. I wouldnt consider Gordon Hayward and Al Horford big name FA lol
"Gordon Hayward and Al Horford are some pretty big free agents. They also have gotten KG, ray allen, and Kyrie by being in Boston"
Shout out to the guy who said he'd let Al Horford rail him and instantly deleted it.
"Al Horford is like 38‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not like they got a high quality big. They gave up a 1st too I believe. Not to mention, HC switch and nobody is replacing Ainge‚Ä¶he a top tier finesser"
"Those aren‚Äôt as low as ya think. Celtics just gutted their staff and traded Kemba for Al Horford.  Not to mention, those picks were for Jerami Grant, not potential hofer Cade Cunningham"
Al Horford it is.
"I don't know. Wouldn't you consider guys like Nurkic or Myles Turner as middle class big men ? Aaron Gordon, Steven Adams, Capela, Al Horford ...  These all feel like middle class bigs."
" Improvement team: This is tough without seeing all the offseason moves but i really like the Al Horford add for the Celtics and a full year with Fournier alongside Smart, Brown, Tatum is solid. If they‚Äôre healthy, they can be a 50 win team.  Decline: I doubt Denver without Jamal Murray for majority of the season in the West can be a 50 win team(54 win pace team last season if it was 82 games)."
&gt;	Kennard because he‚Äôs not gonna get traded without firsts attached could they even fit Wall?  lol al horford got traded with one first attached making 28 million. kennard would need a pick max
Kyrie Irving and Al Horford?
"Steph Curry will fall off this year when Klay comes back simply because of lower usage. If GSW lands any other shooter or ball handler then Steph's production will also drop.   I expect Vucevic to take off for the Bulls this year. It's his first time with a decent coach who has plays for big men and won back to back NCAA titles with Joakim Noah and Al Horford. Vuc is incredibly skilled, decently mobile and wider than most centers these days. I expect there to be better spacing for him after some roster changes. And if Bulls land a real point guard then expect Vuc to get tons of easy dunks and put backs."
"al horford in his prime was not worse than Sabonis, arguably better even   draymond is better than simmons too"
I had to stretch it but that‚Äôs at his core  Jokic plays nothing like Al Horford either Horford is a defensive minded center
"2011 came kinda close. There are only 4 guys that year that have a less than 50% chance of making the Hall of Fame, according to Basketball reference probability.   One of them is Manu, whose 4 championships and 10 international medals will probably get him in, and another is D. Rose, who could get in just because every single MVP made the hall of fame. So really there are only 2 players from that year who have almost no chance, Al Horford and Deron Williams."
I‚Äôd give you al horford for that
&gt;The Celtics already started off with a big offseason news with trading away Kemba Walker for Al Horford  Lol. Probably won't make a difference.
Bledsoe is a glorified expiring. We‚Äôre better off Al Horford-ing him this season and not taking on Kemba‚Äôs albatross.   Adams is making 17 mil the next two seasons. Maybe a little overpaid but very movable and great for salary matching.
"now that ive really sat and watched the bucks these past few months, i will say that coach bud is a lame duck coach.  this is the guy that won 60 games with al horford as his best player and now his bucks team is completely lacking any creativity.    i feel like there's a million things you can do with giannis but he's just letting him clear out from 30 feet away."
"I mean I thought the Sixers were shit a year ago, and Morey somehow managed to finesse Seth Curry for Josh Richardson and trade Danny Green for that Al Horford contract. Those two players were just what they needed. The team didn‚Äôt win this year, but those were impressive moves nonetheless.   I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if ownership was the main factor in a Harden for Ben Simpson‚Äôs deal not getting done."
"Al Horford was by far their 2nd best player during that stretch where they were winning a lot of games, he is no longer in the team.  As long as they force minutes for Poku and Maledon they will lose a ton of games.  Kemba is going to be load managed a lot and will almost definitely get shut down for stretches of weeks too."
"I feel like morons just think anyone can get 25m a year. Actually look at who makes 25+m a year. Most of them are either All-Stars or players that were meant to be team's keystone players. Some weirder ones (Al Horford, Otto Porter), but most are just legit team's star players."
"I think our opinions just differ. IMO JT was the best but I can see the argument for Al  Horford. Terry Rozier tho. He wasn't better than Tatum, he disappeared more"
"The team can tell him to stay home (see Thunder and Al Horford), but many would rather have the roster spot free."
"No because Al Horford isn‚Äôt a difference maker in terms of a chip lol. I really wonder why you are saying yes, it wouldn‚Äôt be just because you are a Celtics fan right?"
"&gt; Detroit receives #3 pick from Cleveland, receives 4 future firsts from OKC  Huh? you just said Detroit received 4 additional first round picks? Even if 5 draft picks are given, most of those would be at the end of draft (except the 6th). I don't think they'd be willing to do it for a chance of Mobley or Green.  &gt; They get rid of Kevin Love for an all star point guard and a good rotation player.  Assuming rumours are correct they'll just buy out Love, and Kemba is not an all star point guard anymore, he literally got traded for a supposed ""washed"" Al Horford."
I don't think a guy who got traded for Al Horford is suddenly gonna get flipped for THT yet alone Mann
It‚Äôd be great if he gets traded back to okc and takes the al horford/cp3 mentorship role and he gets the green light to shoot it from deep since the team‚Äôs tanking anyway
"I always thought Joe was overrated. In my opinion, he basically fits the template of the most common guys to get overrated: guys who score a lot, but at moderate/slightly below average efficiency, and don't do enough else to help you win. (The opposite of Al Horford, really, who I was always a big fan of). I mean, I think there's a reason those teams typically petered out in the high 40s wins and the player who missed the season after he left Phoenix was Amare, who was injured most of the year.   I was never huge Josh Smith fan.   Korver didn't get to Atl until 2013.  Now that Trae seems to have made a slight but crucial shift in his approach to leading the team, and Collins doesn't sulk when he's not scoring, I love the way all this team's parts fit together. They've got a lot of guys (Bogie, Gallo, the second-half-of-the-season John Collins) who help you win more than their box score stats say. Capela is basically the perfect center to pair with Trae. If Hunter can nudge his three-point shooting up a tad he's a great fit with the rest of the team.   The great forgotten Hawks team, IMHO, is 2015. I think they could have put a scare into the Cavs in the east if not for the NYPD. (Everybody forgets that team, but Thabo was the guy whose job was to make LeBron work for it. It doesn't feel like an injury to a role guy should turn a series so dramatically, but that team was like a Swiss watch - everybody excelled in their role because they understood what it was and they weren't being asked to do anything outside of their strengths - but remove one cog and the whole thing falls apart) In hindsight, I suspect David Blatt would have outcoached Bud in a close series, if LeBron let him - but that's not a given."
Is that Al Horford music I hear? ü§£
Mike Bibby and Al Horford. Easy.
Never forget we went from almost signing Al Horford to signing Mahinmi for 4/64
Al Horford left the Hawks because more celtics fans showed up to their playoff games
"A bad shooter having the courage to shoot is still vastly better than never shooting at all.  When players guard Giannis, they just pack the paint because they know he will refuse to take a shot at all.  I dont know how you can watch that and even begin to defend it.  Boston literally put Al Horford on him, and Al just sat at the restricted area and didnt even bother moving out.  Giannis will still hit the occasional three, sometimes even 3 or 4."
"Trae made this city his, finally a star player. Not fucking Paul Milsap ( I love him) or Al Horford (no offense)."
"That wasn't close to happening though. We were just being delusional.   A better one would be if Al had chosen DC over Boston in 2016 FA. That 2017 team with Al Horford instead of Mahinmi, Nicholson and Smith definitely makes the ECF and takes at least a couple from the Cavs imo."
"I like this question so I'm trying to cover some of the non discussed ones like the doubles, I'm sure I'm missing people. 1-1 Harden CP3 3-5  Dr. J and Moses Malone. 5-5 Hakeem and Sampson. They were both playing center.  2-2 Maybe TMAC and Vince? (They hadn't really come into their own yet that's probabaly not the best) a classic one would be Jerry west and Gail Goodrich 4-4 This one is hard but I am gonna go with Josh Smith and Al Horford  3-3 Paul George and Kawaii Leonard."
"Yeah, I think that's the part non Celtics fans don't really understand. Al Horford is an extremely talented passer and plays unselfishly. He's one of my favorite Celtics of the last 20 years, the way he glues those guys together, and we can get away with Marcus Smart's faults now that Al is back."
And Al Horford. He is a beautiful man.
"Dort, Shai, prolly Ja, and of course Al Horford"
"How restricted is tanking right now? OKC is just sending Al Horford home for half a year and declaring that SGA has the worst case of plantar fascitis known to man. It's still a thing, teams just modify how they get there. They just changed the draft odds to try to discourage it."
Here‚Äôs a list of the top 5 playoff games without a finals appearance: https://www.instagram.com/p/CQzSJkMrQkZ/?utm_medium=copy_link  Paul Millsap - 129 Al Horford - 124 Chris Paul - 123 (until Game 1) Joe Johnson - 120 Steve Nash - 120
"&gt;Russ tries so hard every game tanking with him on the team would be tough  Just rest him a lot, give him the Al Horford treatment and don't worry. He ain't gonna totally ruin a tank"
"It's starting to look like he's lost his spot on our team but he's not nearly as bad as our sub treats him.   His biggest problem is that he's too passive. If a team can get him to come out of his shell consistently he could be a nice rotation piece.   ***  **Shooting:**   From a 3P shooting standpoint, he was as accurate and as frequent as Jae Crowder was for us over his last 2 seasons in Boston, he just played a smaller role.    | 3P%| 3PA per 36 ---|---|---- Semi| 36.7 | 6.0 Jae (2015-17) | 36.9| 5.9   The issue is Jae scored a lot more off everything else. He was a much better cutter and more active scorer overall. Semi is too passive outside of his shooting.     | 2P%| 2PA per 36 ---|---|---- Semi | 49.2| 2.4 Jae (2015-17)| 53.4| 6.0  ***  **Defence:**   Semi has an incredible defensive body: 6'6, 240lbs, good vert, great lateral quickness, good wingspan, absurd strength and a lot of that strength is in his lower body.    You'll legitimately see power forwards bounce off him. He's the immovable object we often play when dealing with an unstoppable force.   Last season we had a good example against the Knicks. Randle was getting to the rim at will powering through everyone on our roster. We subbed in Semi. Randle bounced off Semi once or twice. Randle stopped trying to drive towards the rim.    The issue again is his passiveness. He's too much of a gentle giant. He's great at using his strength to absorb contact, but he doesn't use that strength to bully anyone.  You see it in the stats, he has a low foul rate (considering the role we have him in) but he just doesn't take any risks [\(eg. 0 blocks all season\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ndzqlt/semi_ojeleye_finished_the_season_with_zero_0/)   ***   **Culture:**  You're not going to get anyone less drama-prone. His workouts are the most famous thing about him:   &gt; It sounded like a sledgehammer was hitting behind Al Horford's locker stall inside TD Garden and Boston‚Äôs veteran big man can feel the reverberations as he puts on his shoes. But Horford just smiles and shakes his head. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúI have a lot of faith in those concrete walls,‚Äù said Horford. &gt;  &gt; Boom. &gt;  &gt; These loud thuds became a familiar white noise in the Celtics locker room after games this season. But, by late April, it felt like the noise was getting louder. Marcus Morris‚Äô stall is a safe distance from the epicenter but even he couldn't help but notice the decibel level.  &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúShem, god damn,‚Äù said Morris.  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Further across the room, Terry Rozier heard the noise but always figured it was just part of the perpetual construction happening around the Garden. Gordon Hayward, who is as far from the pounding as possible, was more aware of what was happening in the adjoining weight room.   &gt;...  &gt;Those booms were a medicine ball that Ojeleye had repeatedly launched into a wall as part of a CrossFit-like routine that Celtics rehab and performance coordinator Zach Markowitz had designed for Ojeleye on nights he doesn‚Äôt get into game action.  &gt;https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/semi-ojeleyes-wall-rattling-workouts-have-readied-him-giannis-antetokounmpo   So if you want someone who's just going to turn up and work without stepping on anyone's toes, that's Semi in a nutshell. But you're not going to hear reports about him holding players accountable or taking a vocal role in the locker room.   ***  The big issue with Semi is that he just doesn't do enough to justify a roster spot atm. It's not an abundance of lowlights that holds him back, it's a lack of highlights.  You'd be happy with everything he provides, if only he was providing more.  Put him on a team like Brooklyn where Harden can feed him corner 3s and he'll have vets like Green (and potentially Tucker) pushing him to be more aggressive defensively and maybe he could be a really nice piece."
PG - Mike Conley or Lillard SG - Jrue Holiday or Jimmy Butler SF - Giannis PF - PJ Tucker C - Al Horford
"marcus smart, evan fournier, jaylen brown, jayson tatum, and al horford."
If the Thunder can get value out of Al Horford who knows what they can make Simmons look like in a year. I really hope.he goes there.
"If you're not an allstar you're not invited to Nets, their third unit will be like Al Horford, Pall Millsap, Kevin Love, Deandre and Jeff Teague"
"**Everything the Boston Celtics did**  They acquired:  - Kemba Walker, whom they had to attach picks to trade away  - Enes Kanter, didn‚Äôt move the needle  - Vincent Poirier, didn‚Äôt move the needle    They Drafted: - Romeo Langford (No. 14 pick) - Grant Willaims (No. 22 pick) - Carsen Edwards (No. 33 pick, via 76ers) - Tremont Waters (No. 51 pick)  Not one of those players turned into something good.    They Lost:  - Kyrie Irving (signed with Nets) - Terry Rozier (trade with Hornets) - Al Horford (signed with 76ers) - Marcus Morris (signed with Knicks) - Aron Baynes (trade with Suns)  That‚Äôs a legit squad to lose. Sure, things didn‚Äôt work out chemistry wise, but the Celtics are back to square 1 with less assets than before and their coach and GM are both gone(retired/promoted)"
The al horford contract
"Why mention Gasol if he isnt Latino?  And  think Al Horford is the best Latino player, not Ginobli."
Al horford Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford
RT this.   Did anybody expect Jeff Teague/Kyle Korver/ Demarre Carrol/Paul Milisap/Al Horford to make the conference finals?  The bucks were going nowhere before he came.  The dude overachieves
He was awesome against Jokic this year? The only guy he consistently struggles with is Embiid and that's literally everyone outside Gasol and Al Horford?
Al Horford was a star in the MIL series in the 2018 playoffs bruh
"We don't have to trade him during the offseason. If all we're getting during the offseason is based of his ATL performance, I'd rather keep him and revisit early season/trade-deadline. This isn't an Al Horford situation where he NEEDS to go or we need that cap space. We still have a very good team with Ben in the lineup."
"Bro, you traded for the Ghost of Al Horford and gave up your pick just to get rid of a dude... That's not ""Keen to make a trade"" that's dumping a crippled Kemba... And you know what? Boston won that trade."
"Oh, definitely. Even around the league they weren't generating as much excitement as their record should. No one wants to watch a team led by Al Horford, Kyle Korver and Paul Millsap lol."
"Jeff Teague made it because he was a big reason why the Hawks won 60 games and had a 19 game winning streak when no one really expected it. I think it was simply a way to reward a true team effort.   Also, how is no one mentioning Al Horford? He is a 5 time all star who averaged 18.6 ppg at his peak but mostly settled around 10-14 ish points. His highest rebounding numbers sat around 10. I'm not saying he wasn't deserving, but given the criteria I've seen so far on this thread, he should fit lol."
"Sixers screwed up with the Al Horford trade, they gave up a heavily protected 2025 1st which blocks them giving up 2024-2028 1sts/swaps.  Doubt the Sixers have the ammo to get Dame, rebuilding teams want draft capital not good players that won‚Äôt be around in 4 years after the rebuild is over."
"Why do people always say this as if Brown and Tatum were the sole reasons for that.  A. Jaylen Brown averaged 5 pts/game in their first ECF run and Tatum wasn‚Äôt even on the team.  B. The year after Al Horford was their best player and Rozier went off.  Their third appearance was definitely because of them but I mean they always had a cupcake path to the ECF. The one time they had a good second round opponent they got smoked.  Now the ‚Äúother guys‚Äù on Boston are objectively worse and the Bucks, Nets, 76ers, and Hawks ain‚Äôt going anywhere. Their future is not as promising as it sounds."
You're right. Losing Kyrie and Hayward for Al Horford and (maybe) Fournier was good. Glad they're finally on the right path.
"I think Timelord will be amazing after 1-2 years of tutelage under Al horford, if the Celtics will choose not to pursue a salary dump.   Salary cap wise, I don‚Äôt know if keeping Al around outweighs getting younger and more talented players, but I hope they‚Äôll go that route!"
"Lol fair, but they‚Äôre totally different dudes in my opinion.  Remember Bagley was so bad on D they had to hide him in the corner on a 2-3 zone? Like the same thing the Heat do occasionally with Duncan Robinson? Mobley blocked 3x as many shots and was terrific at containing penetration, literally the perfect modern defensive big.  Bagley was also mostly a garbage man on offense, while Mobley was an initiator who could actually read the defense and play from the perimeter in addition to rolling to the rim. Bigger Al Horford in my mind.    I get taking Cade/Green ahead of him cause of where the game is going, but I‚Äôm crazy high on Mobley too."
Is Al Horford a hated player?  I hadn't heard much about that
Al horford
You‚Äôd also have Al Horford. He may be the best option.
Didn't delete my comment history but I held back negative comments about him: Al Horford
Fans are some of the most emotional people. Two years ago every bucks player was nuttin for bud on the team. Remember when Bud took the Hawks far in the playoffs and got coach of the year? A team centered around Paul millsap and al horford‚Ä¶.Great players but not superstars. Bud is a good coach. Bucks are in the ECF. Just cus he got out coached in a series doesn‚Äôt make him a bad coach. The team won anyways.
"Crazy, maybe that‚Äôs the exact reason we played the defending champs in the first round as a 2 seed. I love how all of you NBA Twitter fucks never seem to comprehend that. The Lakers weren‚Äôt a normal 7 seed, but AD missing 2 games and Lebron not being 100% made them a lot closer to that... even though you‚Äôre brain dead if you take the 2021 Celtics or either 7 seed last year over this hurt Lakers team (Dinwiddie Nets and Blazers).   I mean we are at the exact same point the Celtics have gotten to in the past decade, that‚Äôs just a factually true statement. Y‚Äôall started off in a much better shape, had the trade of the decade, and yet your success isn‚Äôt greater than the Suns with Devin Booker. Tough to hear, isn‚Äôt it? 3 conference finals, never won a 4th game.... tough. You thought you‚Äôd be on the rebuild... with Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, and Al Horford? Or was that with just Kemba and Gordon? 3 allstar level players, Tatum, Brown, and Smart... still couldn‚Äôt make it past the ecf. Like I said, tough lmao"
"Idk about other teams but Boston fans fucking love Anna Horford, almost as much as Al himself."
You are using an article quoting Al's father. Al said in this interview https://www.ajc.com/sports/basketball/horford-opens-about-his-decision-leave-atlanta/wLF0O26kyzG1GG6WGRZ9hP/ that he disagreed with his father.
"[His *dad* talked some smack](https://www.ajc.com/sports/basketball/horford-opens-about-his-decision-leave-atlanta/wLF0O26kyzG1GG6WGRZ9hP/) that Al said he disagreed with, but yea... Not finding much about Al saying anything bad about Atlanta."
https://www.si.com/nba/2016/07/03/al-horford-dad-hawks-celtics-fans-decision  Dude was a dick but thanks to him leaving we got a rebuild and Trae so it definately worked out.
Grant Williams and Al Horford for John Collins. Who says no?
"Not total turnover but after the 16-17 season, the Celtics got rid of everyone but Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Al Horford, and Jaylen Brown. Smart and Rozier were also the only guys left from the 15-16 team."
"Paul Millsap is a good one, so is John Wall. Dlo, Vucevic, Luka, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, KAT unless he really turns his career around, Iggy shouldn't make it IMO but he might."
"3-seed + Tatum being top 3 in MVP voting.   They‚Äôre both *possible* and they probably depend on each other to happen, but I just can‚Äôt see either happening. Celtics were in the play-in last season, they‚Äôre going to jump to 3 now because of Al Horford? Tatum definitely has the talent but if the team isn‚Äôt a top 2 seed I don‚Äôt see how he can be top 3 MVP candidate."
"Because last yr people were talking about him as ""worst contract in the NBA"" type status and Zach Lowe said the league viewed Al Horford last offseason as a meaningfully less negative deal it was that bad. Now I bet he's more a slight negative to other teams some maybe even a neutral asset.  29 yrs old 6'8 forward neutral defender now mostly, 20 a game on 60% TS someone can talk themselves into it type of guy teams do it with.   Im not a big  Tobias guy, he did escape alot of criticism because of Ben Simmons, but his value is definitely higher now than it was a yr ago"
"I‚Äôm a huge fan of Taytum and Brown has really grown on me. Smart has a weird style but it works for them. Celtics finished 3rd last season behind Nets and Bucks. There‚Äôs no way in hell they become better than they were last year with a team that literally substituted young/mid-prime players for a bunch of guys on the verge of retirement and an even more Inconsistent Pg, then you‚Äôre trippping.   They added: Al Horford Kanter Dennis   They lost: Fournier  Thompson Walker  Comparing what they got and what they lost, the latter is obviously better."
"I give it a solid B+ Maybe even A-  Tatum, Brown, Smart, TimeLord Locked up long term on good contracts. So the core is secure.  Biggest issues was bench depth last year and lack of ball movement. As well as lack of trying on defense honestly.  Al Horford and Schroder together add a solid center, ball handling, spacing, and ball movement through Al. Plus a bench with actual NBA players in Kanter, Dunn, Richardson. (Nesmith and PP will step up more too). Plus Schroder was a steal.  New coach ‚Äùshould‚Äù fix lack of ball movement and defense as well.  Biggest question is Al Horford‚Äôs age but should be solid either way. Just needs to be average al.  So solid B+/A-  People sleeping on how good this team will be. ALSO saved money and space for Beal next year."
"It‚Äôs never too late to get educated‚Ä¶[here‚Äôs 8:40 of Yao‚Äôs career highlights](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve3H4tYj47c). It is a joy to watch, featuring posters of Shaq, KG, Alonzo Mourning, Ben Wallace, Theo Ratliff, Al Horford, Zach Randolph, and many more."
"Probably going to see Rob as the starter barring health issues. Horford is a great vet to have with this crew but Rob is a literal game changer when he's in there. Plus, there are a lot of questions on the roster and having someone like Al to stabilize the bench unit has a lot of merit as well. Overall, this roster, as offensively limited as I think it's going to be, has almost universally swappable pieces at every position except 4 (still nobody behind Tatum), so I think we're going to see a lot of different lineups starting and throughout the games. We did that last year too, but it because our team had commandeered an entire hospital ward, this time it projects to be by choice."
"Honestly hard to say, especially with a new head coach. Most Celtics fans and media have assumed Jayson, Jaylen, and Marcus are locks, and Rob Williams/Al Horford will be the starting center. Then the 5th after that who knows"
"Horford is more advanced than Rob as a passer, ball handler, and screen setter, and of course lets them play 5 out. I think Al will get the start, but it will be like a Gasol/Ibaka situation where both are similarly important."
"Ya the wizards have gotten Spencer Dinwiddie and the Celtics got Al Horford, Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward and hell even Kyrie had Boston on his list in the last 7 years. What are you even talking about man. And lmfao at Tatum coming to DC. Also, Brad has been great this offseason. Let‚Äôs see what happens tho."
"They didn‚Äôt stop trying. Their best player, Christian Wood, got hurt, which prompted the losing streak. Go watch the press conference with Steven Silas when they hit 20 straight losses, that was not a dude not trying to win. He was devastated. Point me to specific lineups he put out there.   The Thunder were 19-24 before their best player got hurt as well. And the Al Horford move was as much about wanting to play young players who the team was interested in as it was about tanking. The Thunder‚Äôs coaches and players played extremely hard last year. They may have been Sabotaged by the FO shipping out all the vets, but they weren‚Äôt sabotaged by the coaches. They certainly would not have beat the Clippers in the last game if that was the case.   Think about your team next year, now imagine you have some big injury problems. Super young  rebuilding teams have the bottom fall out when that happens."
"Houston was 11-11 last season. Harden was traded mid January, and they actually won 7/8 games after that...so that shows they COULD compete. But they stopped trying.  Out of the remaining 50 games, they only won 6...and finished with the worst record in the NBA. I'm sorry...but ANY NBA team could do better unles they are actively trying to lose. Wall didn't play in 23 of those games.  Also shoutout to the Thunder (who had the 4th worst record) who was paying Al Horford 27.5M dollars to sit on the bench (not injured) because he might win them more games."
"I doubt Ainge would've offered Horford the same contract that Philly did, but Al said that things could've gone differently if he knew the Celtics would be signing Kemba.  The Celtics may have gone to the Finals in the bubble if Horford was there. Their biggest weakness was an inside presence; Theis just got continually bullied by Bam in the ECF.  Regardless, I think it was a mistake to sign Kemba, and apparently Brad Stevens agrees lol"
"Oh yeah I forgot about Al Horford, but like you said if KD had stayed in OKC Horford would have gone there too.  Was that the same year Aldridge was a free agent? Honestly can't remember."
"Ownership would've shelled out to keep the starting lineup + Smart together for at most one more year, and this is assuming that Al Horford is willing to take less money to win some more. I could also see us giving Morris a two year deal, so that he can be off the books once Tatum gets on his max. After that, Hayward probably leaves for money and the Celtics are likely unwilling to pay out as Irving, Smart, Brown, Tatum, Horford is plenty expensive (and competitive) as is."
"in 2021 that's 5 20 ppg scorers and then Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Daniel Theis, Morris who are starter quality players who play both good offense and defense   the timing wasn't right for the team especially with the Hayward injury and Tatum and Brown not being good enough yet"
At the time I was Worried the Warriors could have put more pressure into getting Aldridge.   I think Al Horford was also FA although he was likely to go to OKC.
"You are missing guys in that list...Here's his career drafting history in the 11-30 range:    Decent Picks| Bad Picks | Unknowns ---|---|---- Kendrick Perkins| Marcus Banks| Romeo Langford Tony Allen |  Delonte West| Grant Williams Al Jefferson|Gerald Green  | Aaron Nesmith Rajon Rondo|J.R. Giddens  |   Avery Bradley|JaJuan Johnson |  Kelly Olynyk|Jared Sullinger|  Terry Rozier| Fab Melo   |  Robert Williams| James Young    |  Payton Pritchard| RJ Hunter|    |Ante Zizic |  |Guerschon Yabusele|  With 9 good picks and 11 bad ones, he's pretty much bang on 50% in that range.  Also worth mentioning, the last 2 'bad picks' (Zizic and Yabusele) were just guys we grabbed who were willing to be stashed for a year because we needed to clear roster spots for incoming stars Al Horford and Gordon Hayward."
Al Horford must‚Äôve kidnapped his wife or something
"&gt;Is Minnesota, Memphis, or Salt Lake City any better than Chicago, New York or Boston?   New York got Amare and Melo and Boston signed Hayward,Al Horford and Kemba.  Minnesota,Utah and Memphis signed jack shit in the past 10 years."
Nephews honestly think that Al Horford was the difference for us making the playoffs that year lol.   Also it's clear tanking is not 100% guaranteed as the kings and Cavs are doing it for years and yet they haven't moved an inch out of the lottery
I wanna say don‚Äôt sign Al Horford so bad but then we don‚Äôt get Danny Green and I like Danny Green so
"&gt;Horford (small upgrade)  Horford ain't the same AL from two years ago, but even at 35 he still is a a whoooooole lot better then Thompson. Tristan was unplayable at time last year. I think offensively Schroder is a downgrade, but Kemba health and defensively make him a liability."
"They just seemed to be totally aimless for the exact wrong 2-3 year stretch.   They fundamentally changed up their roster for like three straight years, sunk their capital, then changed up again. I‚Äôm not sure the RoCo-Reddick-McConnell roster was all that much worse than this current one, but they never stuck with a group long enough to find out if it could just be tweaked.   Instead it was wild swing after wild swing and then ‚ÄúO shit! I guess Al Horford makes zero fucking sense on this roster! Sell sell sell!!!!!!!!‚Äù"
Yeah because people wanna see al horford and Paul millsap on Christmas
No I‚Äôm saying imagine. That you just said trade an all star for a package centered around a backup center that will get maybe 15 minutes a game if that. And Al horford came off the bench for them at the end of his tenure with the sixers.
"How are we supposed to prove a team is tanking actually, a team like OKC would just be like ""yeah Al Horford is day to day with a sore foot"" or something like that and make him miss 20 games.  Is what the Raptors did last year tanking ? Or does it only matter if it starts earlier in a season ?"
"Boston Sends:  4 second rounders, a first rounder, Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier, Tristan Thompson  Boston Receives:  Al Horford, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and 17m TPE that they likely will not even use."
"Kevin Love, Steven Adams? Al Horford? John Wall?"
This is just my skewed view on what I‚Äôd expect from each pick by using a player and their accolades/skill  1 - John Wall   2-5/6 - Al Horford/Mike Conley level  6-10 -Wiggins  11-14 - Terry Rozier before he left Boston  Past Lottery you should be happy with a starter/25mpg level guy imo
If you are trying to make this a big market thing Philadelphia is not a free agent destination.  Their biggest FA acquisition this millennia was 34 year old Al Horford on an overpay.  It‚Äôs NY/LA/ Miami and a massive gulf after that.
Losing kemba and Fournier but getting schroeder and 35 year old al horford.   still we won the off season lol
"What, you got tired of Lou Merloni saying Al Horford was league average?"
"If Beal is an FA and wants to go to Boston, he‚Äôll end up there and the Wizards will be lucky to get 35 year old Al Horford back. Of course this all is dependent on Beal wanting to go to Boston, if he doesn‚Äôt then tough luck."
you don't think we're getting Brad Beal for a 35 year old Al Horford? üòÇ
"i watched the entire thing at 6x speed. it's not THAT bad of a list  how is andre drummond #165? how is he above al horford, bradley beal, jrue holiday, john wall, KAT, brad daugherty? kevin love over yao ming? billups over reggie miller? moncrief over miller?"
"the 2019-2020 Celtics didn't have Al Horford, so that's a bunk comparison"
Idk why teams just dont do the OKC and Al Horford last year and say ‚Äúyeah he‚Äôs not injured but he‚Äôs off for the last 28 games‚Äù instead of a buyout. Not unless the player has some legal say in not playing I dont know about.
Al Horford

"Comparing their age 20 seasons Zion is scoring 10 more ppg on better efficiency than Tatum. Put Zion on a team with Kyrie, Hayward, non-washed Al Horford and Jaylen Brown and he would make the playoffs too. There are some arguments for Tatum over Zion but this isn‚Äôt one."
Al Horford HeHe - will he even get 10mins a game?
Williams will take over at some point if he‚Äôs feeling good.   Horford will start as Timelord works on getting his stamina up and playing every game. Then I think as the season progresses Al is going to rest a lot to be in peak for the playoffs. Horford‚Äôs defense is critical for the Celtics to have a shot to get past Giannis or Embiid in the East so they can‚Äôt have him banged up.
"&gt;	Stars of today  &gt;	Al Horford, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Paul Millsap  Think you scuffed that one buddy"
Is 35 year old Al Horford really gonna start the whole season? Any chance Robert Williams supplants him?
My exact thoughts. Big al is Jefferson‚Äôs nickname not horford
"Al Horford and Robert Williams are good defenders, u guys had TT last year who was horrible and couldn't defend."
Al Horford is already forgotten. Every time I see he‚Äôs on a team i‚Äôm amazed he hasn‚Äôt retired yet.
"I scored on Al Horford. I blew by him and did reverse lay up but I ended up hurting my ankle, but was worth it. He was also trying by the way, he tried blocking my shot and I can tell cause he smacked the backboard but I did a reverse lay."
"I‚Äôm confused because this sub sucks when it comes to abbreviations. Are we talking about Allen Iverson or Al Horford?   If it s Iverson then it‚Äôs a stupid comparison. Different eras, different roles, different positions. No point in comparing them.   If it‚Äôs Al Horford then it‚Äôs a stupid comparison as well. Jokic is obviously better."
Like Al Horford??
Yeah the hype was legit. And even though OSU lost the title game he as a true freshman completely destroyed Al Horford and Joakim Noah who were like 2-3 years older.
"Lol probably. He‚Äôs not bad. I just don‚Äôt think this guy is as good as some people say. I mean, Jokic? He‚Äôs not even close in terms of their passing abilities. Jokic is a wizard man. Even Al Horford is better than Noah."
The most comparable player I can think of is Al Horford.

"Bud also won 60 games with a Al Horford, Paul Milsap, and  Kyler Korver big 3. I don‚Äôt know why you are getting downvoted."
Westbrook averaged a triple double for four out of the last five years and is 2 spots above Al Horford and 5 spots below KAT. Not saying WB is a world beater but this list is a little weird. Might be helpful to know more of the metrics they used.
Thomas was a legitimate MVP candidate that year  Bud also made it to the ECF on a team with Al Horford as the best player.
&gt;  identical resume to Brad Stevens who was seen as one of the best coaches in the league  Brad was making it to the ecf with Isaiah Thomas and Al Horford.   Bud has a two-time MVP.  Brads teams consistently outperformed expectations and Bud's (until this year) underperformed.
"We added Al Horford, Josh Richardson, and Dennis Schroder to a team that didn't have a bench and was *constantly* injured last year, while losing Fournier (who played sixteen games for us) and Kemba (who played 43 games for us and wasn't very good even when he *did* play). Seriously, I cannot stress how poor our bench was, and how much more our rotation was impacted by injury and COVID‚Äî Jeff Teague, Grant Williams, and Tremont Waters started a combined **17** games for us."
Al horford was traded though
"Teams have done it.  Off the top of my head, the Lakers did it with Luol Deng, Memphis with Iggy, and OKC kind of did it with Al Horford."

"how are the celtics better then the knicks ? we stole their front court and the celtics only added al horford while losing their 1st round pick,  celtics should be much worse"
clint capela and al horford above Sabonis is fight worthy
"""Veteran Bigs like Nikola Vucevic, Al Horford, and Serge Ibaka may camp out on the perimeter, but defenses contest their outside shots less than 40 percent of the time. As a comparison, historically shaky three pointers like Russell Westbrook and Ricky Rubio are guarded at around the same rate. """
Any Al Horford fans in the chat
I‚Äôd rather have Al Horford as a coach then a player
"Let me know when they actually sign a free agent worth while, and don‚Äôt bring up Al Horford either. That dude was fuckin trash.  Also just because they‚Äôre a ‚Äúbig market‚Äù team doesn‚Äôt mean players will want to play here."
"Agreed on Horford being a really underrated move. Celtics needed big depth (especially with Rob's injuries), smart team defense, shooting, and playmaking (as in, people other than Jays who can organize the offense) and Al should still be able to do all of those. Ideally, splitting the big minutes between Al and Rob should benefit both of them too."
"A team with Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaq, David Robinson, and John Stockton and youre calling REGGIE MILLER the leader?  And theres a LOT of 5 time allstars that get .00001% of the love reggie gets. Al Horford has 5 allstars too. Kyle Lowry has 6. Amare Stoudemire has 6. Aint nobody give them the love reggie gets.  Also, I do think he should be in the HoF (mostly for longevity and some of the iconic playoff moments) but I also DO NOT think he was anywhere as good as people think he was."
He looks like Al Horford had a baby with Chris Bosh.  Which makes me all the more pissed you guys extended Allen.  Everything about Mobley but his strength screams elite Center with the rim protection and switching but I fear offensively playing with another big who can't shoot is going to relegate him to spot up duty.  For a year that's fine but he needs to operate at the elbows.
"Al Horford isn't KD, but he signed at close to the max originally, didn't he? Gordon Hayward was one of the top free agents in the year he signed, iirc."
"Al Horford was the leader first of all. You‚Äôre right about the scoring. That was my bad. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs negated anyway since he gave up close or just the same on the defensive end.  His story just shows that there is justice in this world. Even now, ‚ÄúThese ni**as gave up on me. They gave up on me.‚Äù is what he‚Äôs saying. The reality is he didn‚Äôt learn how to be a team player. He has napoleonic complex. He‚Äôs so insecure that he brings up the fluke 1 ‚ÄúMVP candidate‚Äù season any chance he gets. He wants star treatment. He wants star money. The reality is he‚Äôs overrated and the reason why he was able to do that is because it took 4 great defensive players and Brad‚Äôs schemes to hide his liability ass. He‚Äôs just at Earl Boykins level that got lucky."
"Depth matters much more in the regular season than playoffs, where we're at a disadvantage in the playoffs is that guys like Schroder/Richardson/Smart are inconsistent.   Also Al will definitely be playing over Rob when it counts, I like Rob, but always trust the experience and IQ of a player like Horford over a promising young player. I won't be surprised if Al has kinda a CP3-esque revival."
"We traded this pick for 35 years old Al Horford lmao, glad Danny is fired but Brad Stevens needs to go."
KD isn‚Äôt as impressive as he was a clear number 2 but he could picked al Horford or mike Conley as well at 3 and 4.
I'm feeling pretty good about the re-tooling this summer  - +Al Horford ‚Äì Tristan Thompson  - +Josh Richardson ‚Äì Evan Fournier  - +Kris Dunn ‚Äì Kemba Walker  - +Dennis Schroder
"Damn forgot Al ""scared of the ball"" Horford was there. Seriously that's a sweet lineup"
Nah we have former Schr√∂der Hawks teammate and certified locker room dad Al Horford
Al Horford might not start
Al Horford? Idk if he‚Äôll start but he‚Äôs getting 27 mil. If he starts it‚Äôs Gallinari at 20 mil.

"2016 Wizards went from chasing KD to chasing Al Horford to signing Ian Mahinmi, Andrew Nicholson, and Marcus Thornton"
What team does al horford play for?
"&gt;  So they destroyed their cap space for two years for picks they may not even convey all while losing both Al Horford/Kemba and Moses Brown.  This may be the most delusional Celtics fanboy thing I've read on this subreddit lmao. Nice job miscontruding the situation to make yourself feel better about the Kemba trade. You know, both parties *are* allowed to be happy here, right?"
Al Horford in Atlanta. He practically nuked the bridge on the way out
"Yeah, I think hindsight makes it clear the Celtics and OKC viewed this trade as #16 for Al Horford and offloading dead cap.   Obviously OKC still kicked the tires to see if they could find a deal they liked before eating the dead cap but they clearly did the deal expecting it."
Which they traded for two heavily protected Houston firsts. So they destroyed their cap space for two years for picks they may not even convey all while losing both Al Horford/Kemba and Moses Brown.
"Well neither Kemba nor Al Horford will be playing for them next season which also needs to be taken into account.  Pretty much, they destroyed their cap for two years for two heavily protected Houston first rounders.  This is what happens when asset collection goes to far, and to be honest if I‚Äôm Shai in this situation I‚Äôm pissed."
Except that if they had just kept Al Horford with his year 2 partially guaranteed contract they‚Äôd have more cap space on average over the next two years with much more in year 2.
But that‚Äôs still more cap being taken up by Kemba‚Äôs buyout than Al Horford would‚Äôve had because he‚Äôs only partially guaranteed after next season.
His sister is queen of stirring it on social media when it comes to all things AL Horford.
"If the Clips are trying to get two-way players on the level of Siakam, I'd be really surprised if Mann wasn't being included in those discussions.  I think a package of Kennard and Bev/Rondo plus the 25th pick might have been enough for a player like Al Horford before OKC traded him to the Celts, but Toronto is probably getting more competitive offers for Siakam."
"Still have no fucking idea why Ainge drafted a sub 6' shooting guard with such a high second rounder.   Actually I love telling the story of how they drafted Carsen Edwards because it's such a clusterfuck:  2019 draft night - Boston owns #20 which ends up being Matisse Thybulle. Boston has 3 first rounders that night so they're kind of forced to trade out.  Boston trades #20 for #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). #24 ends up getting traded along with Aron Baynes to Phoenix to free up cap space to overpay Kemba Walker. Phoenix has a protected 2020 first from Milwaukee that they give to Boston.  2020 draft night - Boston's first from the previous trade is #30 which ends up being Desmond Bane (all rookie team, mind you). That pick is immediately traded to Memphis for future second rounders.  Those future second rounders are traded for a half a season of Evan Fournier. Boston then traded their 2021 FRP (#16) along with Kemba Walker to OKC for Al Horford and to free up cap space which they were hopefully going to use to re-sign Fournier. Fournier dipped for the bag.  So long story short, Boston squandered those picks (and ended up giving another pick away) for pretty much nothing."
"And you know what's funny? Haven't we seen a ton of good offensive bigs just suddenly extend their range to the 3 point line halfway through their career? Marc Gasol, Jonas Valanciunas, Nikola Vucevic, Joel Embiid, Al Horford, all these dudes started out shooting only last-second heaves but were solid in the midrange, then they stepped back one summer and naturally added a 35% J to their arsenal.  I'm certainly not saying Sengun is going to start making 3+ a game, but it seems like one of those things I'd be less worried about if I were a GM."
"His agent also reps Duncan Robinson, Jrue, Al Horford, Dinwiddie and others that have gotten incredible contracts. Has r/nba thought that maybe the league didn't value Payne as much as this sub? The guy had plenty of chances before finally fitting in with the Suns so maybe most teams weren't willing to give much more than that."
"There was a time where Al Horford and Tobias Harris were the two highest paid 6ers. Yes it was a much different FO, but I don't take anything for granted."
"Washington's offseason 2016 moves was an extreme blunder that should be talked about as much as draft busts. The moves they made that summe, and the next summer, left them stuck, well before Wall's supermax kicked in.   *Quick run down (after being paid dust by KD, and, missing out on signing Al Horford):   Signed Scott Brooks at $35M/5yr, making him one of the highest paid coaches at the time. Also, hired another former coach of KD to the staff. Frank Vogel was hired twice during the span of that deal, first by division rival, Orlando Magic.  Signed Ian Mahinmi at $64M/4yr, making him a higher paid player than then-starting C, Marcin Gortat. Mahinmi was also turning 30, while coming off a severe injury that kept him out for a heavy majority of the subsequent season.   (*Horford was also about that age, but, also significantly better than Mahinmi).  Signed Jason Smith at $16M/3yr, adding another 30+ year old C to the mix. In that first season with Washington, he averaged less than 15 minutes per game, for the first time in 5 years.  Signed Andrew Nicholson at $26M/4yr, after being a benchwarmer for a poor Orlando Magic team. Theoretically, he could shoot, but, he couldn't play, resulting in Washington trading away a first round pick (who became Jarrett Allen) to the Nets, for Bojan Bogdanovic. Nicholson was then traded to the Trailblazers (for Allen Crabbe), who stretched his contract.   In 2017, Washington signed Otto Porter at $106M/4yr, making him the highest paid player on the team, two years before Wall's supermax kicked in (Wall signed his new deal that summer). It also resulted in Bogdanovic leaving, meaning the first round pick they traded was for a rental of Bogdanovic.  None of those players were tradable for a roster upgrade, besides possibly Otto Porter (seemed like inking Porter's deal put a time clock on Kelly Oubre's time in Washington). Otto was a highly useful player, but, that contract was a brutal amongst everything else. And, for about 3 years, Washington was reduced to signing players to vet minimum deals (or, splitting the taxpayer MLE) so the team was stuck in place, while surrounding EC opponents built rosters with depth."
"Most stupid part is that he was turned into a ''meme'' this season after a bad year with the Raptors, dude is an NBA champion, was a great back up to Al Horford in the Cs and had a career year at 33 with the Suns just last year... Basketball moves fast I guess"
"This is technically right, but if you look at the gestalt, it's not.  This is pretty much going to be a lost season in terms of chasing a banner, so the focus is really on improving for 22-23. The proof is all there at this point: the Horford deal, the slow offseason, the lack of bids for guys like Fournier, the articles and ""cap flexibility""...  So while it will be good for the brand to win games, good for fans' sanity to have a professional NBA roster... the point will be to see how the young guys can grow and fit, and how the new coach can mesh with the new GM and roster core.  Who needs to be the 3rd option? Not a Schroder-type, but rather guys already on the roster: Langford, Pritchard, Nesmith. The dream is the Jays and Timelord and Smart out there with a superstar, and then the aforementioned trio growing into the next core while scoring buckets off the bench... but plan C will be to plug 1-2 of them into the starting rotation should Beal et al not work out.  Guys like Horford and Schroder will anchor this next season, but they'll be gone after that (or be back on min. contracts), and while we won't tank, I think plan #1 will be minutes for the young guys over everything else."
"That's a great breakdown of the situation. Simmons is not a player I personally consider in the elite tier where the max contract for them is an underpay, but 76ers fans sound completely detached from reality when they say that he's worth nothing close to his contract without shooting better.   Look around the NBA, Gordon Hayward, Kemba Walker, Al Horford, Kevin Love are getting paid close to Simmons money and they produce nowhere near his value. Porzingis, Tobias and Wall are getting paid more than Simmons and are producing less value. Simmons is a DPOY candidate and a great passer in transition which like it or not, is valuable in the regular season when players are less willing to sacrifice their bodies on the defensive end. He's a 3 time all-star in 4 years of playing. Perennial all-stars get max contracts easily in today's NBA.  Simmons on the open market is still a 25-30 million a year player. He fits the Sixers exceptionally poorly because their superstar is a big, but that does not make it his obligation to change his game, it's on their front office to build a team that suits their star.   As for the trade request, wasn't this mutually agreed to when his group and the Sixer FO had a meeting at the start of the off-season? They said that they would like to trade him, he agreed that he would be better in a different situation. Then Morey spent the entire summer making ridiculous trade demands very publicly to the point where everyone who follows the NBA knows that the Sixers are only keeping him begrudgingly. Why wouldn't a player hate the team at that point? He needs to report to camp, take the money and crush the team morale as much as he can."
What was worse for the Sixers? Al Horford or Doc Rivers? At least Al isn't a moron...
Al Horford was ready to jump out his chair for his teammate getting his shit pinned
"Rudy Gobert, the 5th highest paid player who is an incredible defender, and also capable of making freethrows at a rate which prevents hacking. The next closest non-scorer to Simmons (ranked 13 highest paid) is... Al Horford at 45th. Next closest is maybe Derrick White ($17,500,000  AAV, 79th highest paid)?"
"Man, this is making me sad. The stats averages don‚Äôt tell the story. It is Dumars, not only for his all universe defense, but he was just such a solid, efficient, but not flashy offensive player. He was low usage, and in turn, had less showy stats. He was low maintenance, and low ego; not begging for touches with players that took pride in scoring‚ÄîIsiah, The Microwave, Aguirre, Dantley. The man just constantly made the right basketball play for the team at all times. He locked down the opposing team‚Äôs best player (though his steals numbers don‚Äôt show that) and could not be ignored on the other end. It‚Äôs sort of like Garnett on Boston. He could have been the offensive focal point, dominating both ends, but decided to play a role for the greater good. Isiah was probably the championship Pistons‚Äô best player, and Dumars was not as dominant as Garnett (Maybe the guard version of Atlanta Al Horford would be a better comparison), but Dumars rivaled Isiah‚Äôs value, in my opinion.  From my perspective, Rip was the least valuable player in the staring lineup of that championship team.  He got them buckets, and made defenders run, but he  didn‚Äôt extend the defense, didn‚Äôt run the show efficiently‚Äîthat was Chauncey‚Äôs job; he was the worst defender in that lineup, Big Ben anchored the defense, Prince defended the best guards and wings, Sheed created matchup problems, played great D, and scored when they needed buckets.   Rip may have been a master of using screens for midrange jumpers, but that is the only area where I feel he exceeds Dumars."
I actually like the fit it‚Äôs like what philly was trying to do when they signed al horford but he couldn‚Äôt be on the court at the same time as embiid but dray and joel would fit better
"Your first paragraph is like when the rich kid complains that his loaded parents only gave him 1000 dollars for his weekly allowance. Like in what world is Gordon Hayward, Al Horford and Kemba Walker not big signings?"
"C's should trade Al Horford + Richardson for Embiid, makes more sense than this  C's maybe throw in a 2nd rounder as a show of good faith"
Celtics offer Al Horford and a 1st for him.
"Celtics have never had a great free agent superstar willingly sign since the big 3. Kyrie was traded to Cs and then lied and left. Al Horford was never that big of a star and they couldn‚Äôt retain him. Hayward was barely a star when he joined. The only guys staying are the Js who are coming off rookie deals. In all honesty, unless Jayson Tatum stays long term the Celtics are an organization with a storied past that may not be reflected in the future. Why would anyone willingly want to be based out of Boston?  Also the Pelicans, good lord, the sheer amount of talent New Orleans has had and to be this bad still. Once again, why would anyone logically choose the Pelicans of their own free will if they didn‚Äôt have other opportunities. Zion is already unhappy, how bad does an organization have to be to be to sour a relationship that quickly. The biggest signing was Jrue Holiday as a FA. Good lord, you look at the Spurs today, no one shits on them and yet there are already talks of ‚Äúhow will they ever find a rebuild‚Äù  Milwaukee and Denver have top 5 players and no FA is running to join them. How often did a superstar think of joining SAS big 3? Role player Pau? LMA? Market always wins, org is literally just ‚Äúwho is the least annoying‚Äù. Orgs thinking they are special..these stars make hundreds of millions of dollars, they‚Äôd rather have their own doctors."
Semi the Giannis stopper  Myles Turner the Giannis stopper  Al Horford the Giannis stopper  Bam the Giannis stopper  Ayton the Giannis stopper
"Nicolas Claxton, Al Horford, Rudy Gobert, Deandre Ayton, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Clint Capela, Semi Ojeleye (lol), Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, and Bam Adebayo have all been ""Giannis stoppers"" at some point or another. Last two have been pretty good though"
&gt; I wouldn‚Äôt really compare basketball royalty to the Pelicans. People go to LA and Boston because it‚Äôs LA and Boston.  Al Horford was the first major free agency signing we had in like 20 years. We are not the same as LA.
"I'd agree we'd be hesitant, but there's a big difference between washed Al Horford and the best shooting big man in history."
Al Horford was balling out after he had his baby last season
Didn't brand make that horrible al horford signing ?
"Danny Ainge built a team with Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, Daniel Theis, and Robert Williams.  At some point the GM can only do so much. Danny Ainge did everything in his power to start a dynasty, it just didn't work out for non-front office reasons."
"Stop it, two years ago Joel had one of the best starting 5‚Äôs in recent memory with JJ, Jimmy, and Tobias against the Raptors and still put up some awful games in that series. The Sixers were loaded till they let Jimmy Butler walk for nothing and signed Al Horford lol and they STILL should‚Äôve beaten the Hawks."
Possible but there was no clear indication from Philly to Keep Jimmy. So they blew the money elsewhere   Harris got like 160M that season too  Simmons 180M  Al Horford 100M
"Yeah I agree I thought he was was good fit but Miami suits better right now   Harris was going to get paid that year and Al horford, Simmons too"
Who the hell is the 19-20 Sixers equivalent of Fox and Haliburton lol. The Sixers 2nd best facilitator that year was *Al Horford*.
Greg was insanely good. The man dominated college basketball playing left handed the whole year cuz of a right wrist injury. And then in the national title game he made Joakim Noah and Al horford look like children.
"I mean they messed up an incredible situation though. If they didn't trade for Fultz they have Embiid/Tatum/Simmons. If they didn't acquire Tobias they could have had SGA.  They threw a bunch of money at Al Horford. They traded assets for a half year rental of Jimmy Butler. Honestly, i would say the process fucking worked. They made all of these horendous decisions and still got close to beating the Raptors and are a dark horse contender."
I'll say it again: they couldn't afford to lose Reddick.  Anyone who who watched their playoff run 3 years ago could see that dude's spacing unlocked so much for them.  Almost made double-centre lineups work.   The summer they made all those moves I said they were done in terms of championship window. Adding Al Horford? Are you kidding?
"Tobias was distinctly bad at the three. Blame it on the lack of Doc, Al Horford, or whatever else, but he was decidedly worse playing the 3, and he would look even worse next to Draymond. Danny is too good to come off the bench for Tobias, and even if he did, he's a better fit for a team with Draymond than Tobias is because he's a far better catch and shoot guy."
Al Horford is on a two year contact averaging 26.5 mill.  Ben Simmons has 4 years and averages 37 mill.  Those aren‚Äôt the same contracts.  Not to mention the last year on horford contract is only 12 mill guarantees.  So Horford has 37 mill left and Simmons has over 100 mill left. That‚Äôs not the same thing
"I was referring more to the fact that some fans thought it would be an easy thing to do or thought he would still play for them in that time. This isn't Al Horford and the Thunder mutually agreeing for him to sit out while he still stays in touch with the team. There's no great way to have this much cap space tied up and not playing, even more so when it has the potential to cause locker room issues. It's going to get very frustrating for the players to be asked about this situation every single game if this goes into the season"
"Should of just done a ""can you win a championship with a team of these 35+ (year old) players""?  **Starting 5:**  * Al Horford (35) * Paul Millsap (36) * Lebron James (36) * P.J. Tucker (36) * Chris Paul (36)  **Bench:**  * Kyle Lowry (35) * Jeff Green (35) * Goran Dragic (35) * Andre Iguodala (37) * Dwight Howard (35) * Rudy Gay (35) * Carmelo Anthony (37)"
A choice between Al Horford and Enes Kanter
For a big men al horford. Hes been a simple yet effective and winning player his whole career. He can pop out and hit a 3 or start the offense at the top of the key or in the post. He knows how to move his feet so he rarely gets cooked on switches and is strong enough to handle most guys in the league. I think hes a great guy to look at since hes not an uber athletic/skilled center but still more than gets the job done. For wings id say gordan hayward plays basketball like every coaches dream just a shame hes never healthy. He almost always makes the right play and doesnt have any holes in his game. Shooting guards it has to be klay. A sniper that gets his looks moving off ball and is a pest on defense. And for pgs kyle lowry. Lowry is small and hasnt always been an amazing player but hes gotten better every year and has really made himself to be one of the most effective guards in the league at both ends. For guys a little taller jrue holiday.   Tldr: guys that play both ends and dont force it on offense

"The one time Embiid had a good backup big, the Lakers take him back and left us to sign their toxic stat-padding big.   &amp;nbsp;  Simmons playing for us with 100% effort or even at all to the playoffs is a big if and so is whatever we get for him.  &amp;nbsp;  Tobias Harris will probably need to have another pseudo 50/40/90 type season again for the regular season and step up more in the postseason.  &amp;nbsp;  We still don't have a closer. We don't have the playmaker we need- Simmons isn't it.  &amp;nbsp;  Strangely enough I still think the Sixers will have a weirdly successful regular season. Even that one season with Al Horford- we were godlike at home and absolute scrubs on the road."
"PG: Chris Paul, Davion Mitchell SG: Devin Booker, Lu Dort SF: Kevin Durant, Jonathan Isaac PF: Draymond Green, Christian Wood C:   Joel Embiid, Al Horford"
"And they still kind of messed up drafting after he left and they sucked again. The only good pick they did was Kyrie and that was the easiest #1 pick in that era besides AD. In 2011 if they draft Kyrie &amp; Klay that‚Äôs amazing back court that would provide some of the most spacing ever and with Klay being the greatest off ball shooter he wouldn‚Äôt get in the way of Kyrie &amp; then eventually LeBron as well. In 2012 instead of drafting Dion Waiters, they should‚Äôve drafted Harrison Barnes to have him play at the wing alongside Klay Thompson to make a very good defensive wing unit and keep LeBron at the 4 so the Cavs stay elite defensively and never have the drop off on the defensive end that they had in the 16-17 season. And with knowing how weak the 2013 NBA Draft is now, I think the Cavs should‚Äôve traded the #1 pick to move down and get assets for future drafts. So in this scenario the Cavs draft CJ McCollum and have him be their 6th man off the bench with anywhere between the 5-10 pick if they traded down and instead of drafting Sergey with the 19th pick in the 2013 draft, they drafted Tony Snell who becomes another defensive wing off the bench that can shoot. Then the last move I would‚Äôve made was trade some of those assets I got for trading the #1 pick to get Al Horford and have him play center so the team would‚Äôve been ahead of the versatility bigs who can switch on the perimeter while stretching the floor. If the Cavs would‚Äôve built their team like this, they could‚Äôve been a 70 win+ team I truly believe and would‚Äôve made those Heat teams look like amateurs."
Our last notable free agent signing btw. Ignoring big Al Horford of course
"i think you‚Äôre forgetting some people. when SGA was sat, so was Al Horford and George Hill was traded"
Al Horford ?
Al horford and joel embiid.
Tell me you‚Äôve had al horford on your team without telling me you‚Äôve had al horford on your team
al horford and joel embiid
Al Horford and Tito Horford
I'm not saying they shouldn't stick up for themselves but that the 76ers aren't really a bastion for FA's and being known as a toxic place towards players doesn't help that.  The last big FA they signed was a declining Al Horford who they threw 30m at to get him to come. Overpaying for FA's is a small market thing no?
"Some people don't get that defense is about consistency. It is like shooting ability.   People post highlights to prove defensive ability. I could post a highlight of Marcus Smart splashing threes. That doesn't make him a great shooter because I'm editing out the 67% that he clangs.   Rob Williams might have one of the best defensive highlight reels in the NBA. He isn't close to prime Al Horford as a defender, because Al made very few mistakes. Rob still makes mistakes (although less than he used to).   Aaron Gordon isn't a bad defender. He is useful. And his size with good defense is valuable. But this clip makes him look like a DPOY candidate."
Al Horford and Josh Richardson: The Return
One of our beat reporters said we don‚Äôt expect to move him this year we‚Äôre just planning ahead. it‚Äôll be more like the al horford situation. we‚Äôll either swap him with another bad contract or buy him out in the off season. a trade deadline buyout is unlikely
"Philly would never do this, but I find it kind of funny that ""salary filler"" in this case would definitely mean Al Horford getting traded back to Philly."
Al Horford for Ben Simmons lets get it done already
"Naw the other piece would have been the Horford signing.  Since that would give OKC Westbrook - Roberson - Durant - Horford - Adams with Dipo and Kanter coming off the bench.    You guys would have had your max slot still but would you really have signed Parsons or just kept Barnes instead. Maybe Batum or DeRozan would have been considered as well but really the drop off after KD was steep, especially if Al signed with OKC."
"The league would have to allow teams to be able to amnesty one player every season/two if we‚Äôre keeping the contracts fully guaranteed. Then that brings up the issue where John Wall, Kevin Love, Al Horford etc. all get amnestied and join the Lakers bench on minimum deals, eliminating the parity we were trying to create in the first place.  A better plan would be allowing teams to go over the cap, but being a little bit more strict on how it‚Äôs allowed. I‚Äôd be curious to see what the potential impact would be on teams losing bird rights if they are over the luxury tax line."
"That was 2 years ago, we had jrich and al horford year before, morey came last year, I'd say he turned it around"
"Yes. Now he is paid about the same money as ""guys worth that money"" like Buddy Hield, Mike Conley, Gary Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, Goran Dragic, Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Al Horford.   10 million less than Kristaps, Blake, Pascal, Wiggins, Kevin Love, McCollum, D'Lo, and Gordon Hayward.  Obviously some of these are overpays but market value for a 25 year old who is really good at one thing, and can be made better at the others? 22m a year is probably what standard looks like."
"Lmao just because they had two young good players doesn't make them young. Al Horford, Smart, Baynes, Theis, Morris, Hayward (who was admittedly injured but still had a Veteran presence)...there were PLENTY of players with skill and experience other than Kyrie. Lmao that's how I know you're a dick riding casual...you think Kyrie is a bona fide superstar. He isn't. It took the league's deepest bench for him to go over .500. Gtfoh and that same team was better when he wasn't playing."
"Yeah Atlanta Is a transplant city , and those Joe Johnson teams were never super inspiring. Still they absolutely deserved more support it‚Äôs nothing like they were ever putrid . I‚Äôd say the current generation of hawks fans is fairly different from that generation of 7-8 years ago.  Al Horford , his wife, and his dad are pretty darn annoying I think he‚Äôs a secretly not as good a locker room guy as folks say"
"Don't even bother, this happens every year where /r/NBA convinces themselves there's no way a player will be traded ""because their contract is so awful!"" and basically every time without fail they end up being traded.   Same thing with player options? ""No way Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, or Chris Paul decline their player options, nobody is gonna pay these guys!"" Lo and behold they all get paid anyways.   This place has the memory span of a goldfish."
"For people who forgot, the team he faced in the finals was Florida with both Joakim Noah and Al Horford (also Corey Brewer).  They constantly doubled Oden in the finals and he still made them look like inept defenders.  That's the potential people are talking about.  Just a shame about his knees, microfacture surgery back then was really risky and it went wrong for him (not sure what the conventional options back then were though).."
"I can‚Äôt think of a way Boston could make that work that Houston would also take. Horford and Richardson? I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôd want Smart, but fuck that. And Al is under contract for the same amount of time, so i don‚Äôt see the benefit."
How is this different from what OKC did with Al Horford?
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

"John Wall is the 11th highest paid player in the NBA @ ~43m/yr for 2 full seasons. A guy that has so far shown he may never return to half of his former glory post-injury, and is still injury prone.  tl;dr Rockets need likely a 3rd team trade with someone going all in on a title contention or really blowing up the franchise to tank  Players that could regress or bad from injury or just bad  Klay Thompson(38m/yr), Jimmy Butler (35m/yr), Kristaps Porzingis (32m/yr), Jamal Murray (31m/yr), Kevin Love (30m/yr), Al Horford(27m/yr)  Players on teams that could really shake things up, whether rebuild or all in for title  Tobias Harris (36m/yr), Ben Simmons (35m/yr), Pascal Siakam(34m/yr), CJ McCollum (33m/yr), Andrew Wiggins (30m/yr), maybe? Gordon Hayward(30m/yr)  Honorable Mentions:  Gary Harris is kind of a bad contract at 21m/yr, Eric Bledsoe makes 19m/yr, Ricky Rubio makes 17m/yr, Eric Gordon (19m/yr) but Rockets own him."
John Wall is going to be on the Celtics by the trade deadline in some sort of deal surrounding Al Horford and Josh Richardson or something.
I think the Rockets know they won‚Äôt get any offers for Wall. But saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sitting him while we look for a trade‚Äù is a way for them to avoid fines for tanking. Also allows them to give more minutes and usage to KPJ &amp; Green at the lead guard roles.  It‚Äôs sort of like the Al Horford-Thunder situation last season. Sit him while you tell the public you are looking for a trade.
"It‚Äôs because he got that contract based off of what he could be and not what he was.   Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but last offseason would have been the end of his original rookie contract (if the Sixers exercised their team option on him), correct?   Weird to think there was a time when great players had to ride out their rookie contracts and improve their game to get a massive payday instead of averaging 14 points a game and getting a max contract because they *could* be a great player one day.  Everything the Sixers have done, from The Process, to trading half of their depth for Jimmy Butler just to let him walk to keep Brown and Simmons, to massively overpaying for Al Horford, to coddling Ben Simmons then ruining their relationship with him on purpose because of one bad series, I‚Äôm almost wishing for them to fail myself. The franchise is such a disgrace the past decade."
"What team has the cap space to take on Al Horford‚Äôs contract? Outside of the team who just traded Al Horford to Boston? Makes 0 sense. Nobody has or is going to use the available cap space to take on Horford‚Äôs salary, to waive him at an expense of $14 Million.   The Bulls have no reason to take on J Rich or Time Lord‚Äôs contracts from Boston to facilitate this move either.  Wishful thinking."
We got the corpse of Al Horford and Josh Richardson
"Kyrie aint kyrie without AI in the league.  How quickly the past fades away for us. Perhaps Kyrie is ""better"" as you say, ok so he is.  AI played in a different era, where it was possible to play how he did and he crushed it.  But in sports, stats aren't everything.  There is no stat for Kyrie being a kook and teammates probably liking AI more or the fact Iverson had the balls to try to lead a team by himself against the likes of Kobe and Shaq, one of the most insane duos the L has ever seen, where as Kyrie needs 2 of the top 5-10 players in the league to team up with.  Iverson took a JV squad to the finals at the helm, Kyrie with the celts made the playoffs 1 out of two years and got bounced in the second rounds having baller teammates like, marcus smart, al horford, jayson tatum, jaylen brown plus a good coach.  Different players, different times.  Both hoopers.  Both got solid shoes too."
Al Horford
Al Horford looks like the kind of man who straight men think we find hot. I just looked up Claxton and was like Whoa he's gorgeous but then I saw him in uniform and I was reminded that he looks like a giraffe.
If this was a real phenomena then nic claxton and al horford would be competing for goat
Al Horford agreed to a deal with Boston prior to KD announcing his intention to sign with the Warriors. This is just OKC front office lies that people have eaten up
The man who's led his team to the best regular season record 2 times and won a championship in the last 3 seasons.      Also the dude who won 60 games with Paul Millsap/Al Horford as the teams best player
"He got called a snake cause he ghosted the entire org then went to the team who beat them in the wcf. Not to mention, okc were in talks to acquire al horford had kd re signed"
"many would be .  I would not be personally bc there are examples of players today that have improved their 3 point % drastically . From below average to above average. And they have less work ethic as MJ.  So for those reasons , I just couldn‚Äôt be surprised.   i.e., Al Horford &amp; LaMarcus Aldridge.  We are also discussing once in generation type player. If Zion Williamson were to become an elite 3 point shooter , I would be more than surprised. I‚Äôd be shocked."
"Al Horford in 2016 if KD stayed. With Horford and KD, Oklahoma City would have been strong contenders to win it all. Russ/Robes/KD/Al/Adams with Oladipo and Kanter off the bench would have been strong"
"There was the big almost thrice, each of which I think would have guaranteed a championship.   There were strong rumours of Blake Griffin joining okc, when exactly I'm forgetting.  The rumour that Al Horford would have signed if kd resigned, providing a big upgrade over Steven Adams and a lot more spacing/flexibility.  The biggest, of almost getting Klay Thompson. That trio of russ kd and Klay would have just ended games"
"If playoff underperformance by key players is the question, I still would have Kyrie for 2019 even though the Bucks were the 1st seed.  Box score averages: * Russ: 22.8/8.8/10.6 and 4.6 turnovers  * Kyrie: 20.4/4.4/6.4 + 3.6 turnovers  Shooting splits:  * Russ‚Äô 36/32.4/88.5 (46.6% ts) * Kyrie‚Äôs: 35.6/21.9/91.3 (44.7% ts)  Kyrie‚Äôs numbers are all worse except ft% and 1 fewer turnover per game (along with 4 fewer apg).   Outside of PG, okc was lacking efficient volume scorers (e.g Adams had efficiency but not volume, Schroeder had volume but wasn‚Äôt shooting efficiently etc). Russ only took 10 more shots than PG over 5 games total so PG got opportunities.   Kyrie took 41 more shots over 5 games than Al who shot the 2nd most, 45 more than Jaylen, and 64 more than Morris. All 3 of them were starters who could could score at volume and were doing so at high efficiency, especially compared to him -  * Kyrie: 20.4 ppg on 44.7% ts  * Horford: 16.2 ppg on 60.5% ts  * Jaylen: 16.2 ppg on 60.2% ts  * Morris: 14.8 ppg on 77.2% ts"
Yeah. I wish Pierce was the inclusive barometer (i.e. Pierce and anyone better than him got in).   I feel like we‚Äôre not far away from someone asking if Al Horford is a HOFer‚Ä¶
"Ewing overlapped his career with the following centers:  Kareem,  Hakeem, Robert Parish, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Dikembe Mutumbo, Alonzo Mourning, Sabonis I, Brad Dougherty, Rik Smits.  In that murderers row of centers, voters looked up and down the league and said ""Yeah, Ewing is a top 3 center this year.""  Dwight Howard overlapped with:  Shaquille O'Neal, Ben Wallace, Yao Ming, Amar'e Stoudemire, Al Jefferson, Kevin Garnett (look, by this stage of his career KG was a center), Al Horford, Joel Embiid.  Dwight's list isn't terrible, and hes a great player, but its not close to Ewing's list."
"I think the fact that Ewing spent his entire prime competing with Hakeem, David Robinson, and then early career Shaq, thus resulting in ""only"" 7 All NBA teams and 3 all defense teams undersells how good he really was.  I was recently discussing Ewing with someone, who argued that Dwight was inarguably ""far, far better"" because Dwight had 8 All NBA teams, 5 First Teams to Ewing's 1.  But I argue that comparing All NBA selections straight up for centers specifically really needs context, because one guys competition was Hakeem Olajuwon, and the other guys competition was Al Horford."
"Part of the issue with players of Bens caliber is that he is way tooooo valuable of an asset to let walk over a few million, but as you said, he needs the right players to thrive. So building around him AFTER he has received his extension is hard af. Ben (35M) Tobi (35M) jojo (31M) Danny Green (10M) is already your entire cap space (112M last season).    Stretch bigs are already hard enough to find. The bjelicas, Bobby portis', ilyasovas, they cost more than that. The best stretch big youre going to find for what Philly can spend is luke kornet. I love my guy luke but you would rather have Dwight.    You gave morey some credit but not nearly enough. He turned al horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth curry. I try not to syck morey off as much as the rest of this sub, but truthfully I am not sure if many gms can pull that off."
What about Joe Johnson and Josh Smith with Al horford? Certainly not superstars but a really good big 3  The last two franchise guys we've got with Granger who was on the low end of star if he even was and he didn't want to stay and was shit after that injury. Then George forced his way out also.
Plenty of players develop outside shots once they get to the league. Jaylen Brown was a bad shooting prospect and shot nearly 40% last season from deep.   Al Horford shot like 8 3s his first 5 seasons and then became a ~40% shooter as well. Shooting can be learned. Being the perfect basketball build cannot.
Al Horford or maybe Joe Johnson.
Enes Kanter was compared to [Al Horford](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/enes-kanter/) and [Tim Duncan](https://walterfootball.com/nbascoutingreport2011ekanter.php). If only Kanter wasn't so shit on defense.
"It didn't work with Al Horford, Ben, Embiid and Tobi. It doesn't work with Tobi, Ben, and Embiid. Spacing is key"
"Philly gets: Peyton Pritchard, Juan Toscano Anderson, AL Horford(money saving purposes next season) 1 first from Boston, 1 first from Golden State  Boston gets: Draymon Green, Shake Milton,  Jordan Poole  Golden state gets: Ben Simmons"
Haslem is a cheerleader. same for Varejao. LMA is a PF that moved to C given the lack of mobility. Howard and Gasol are shell of their prime. Baynes was hot trash last season. Jeff green ain't no center.  I'll give you Al Horford.
Their play styles are anything but modern except Boogie (who suffered two catastrophic injuries for a man his size). More ‚Äúmodern‚Äù centers such as Al Horford and Brook Lopez are still useful into their mid thirties
Players like Robin Lopez and Al horford managed to learn to shoot 3s at a good percentage even though they had minimal shooting skills coming into the nba. You really think the greatest midrange shooter of all time couldn't find a way to extend his range if he needed to? Even lebron figured it out and he's not half the shooter Jordan was.
"Al Horford, a pick or 2, salary filler if needed"
I‚Äôm already miserable from the flux of the off-season and the fact that this is dragging out forever. If Al Horford comes back to the Sixers I will set myself on fire and jump off the nearest roof üòÇ
those atlanta joe/josh smith/al horford teams were good they just ran into prime LeBron every year
"Nique is number 1 no doubt, Pettit and Cliff Hagan  are weird for me my grandpa actually grew up rooting for those teams in St. Louis, but it‚Äôs not like that title means anything to Atlanta. I‚Äôm fairly certain Trae will surpass Joe in the next couple seasons, but you also have guys like Pistol Pete, Dikembe, Sweet Lou Hudson, and you could probably even throw in Al Horford into the mix (although I wouldn‚Äôt) ."
"al horford is a great pick. it‚Äôs hard to imagine any fanbase remembering him, much less the nba as a whole"
Al Horford has been between all star to really good starter level for nearly 15 years and has already been forgotten while still in the league lmao.  Al Jefferson has already been forgotten and 5 years ago he was all nba
"Tobi could be, but Al is not gonna be forgotten in the future. He was an incredible player in his prime. Bit of a tangential story, my fav sports game from childhood was NBA Live '08. I played the Live version of MyTeam with the Wizards. Already had Arenas, Caron Butler and Antawn Jamison, then took KD AND Horford in the draft. Not only did we go 82-0 for the season, Al was the best player on that team. Then he joined the Celtics IRL a few years later and cemented his legacy as my favourite non-star player of all time."
"Huh, why would Sixers fans remember Al Horford over Celtics or Hawks fans?"
Beal. even if he gets traded- just not that memorable of a player for casuals even though he‚Äôs very fucking good  john wall might not get remembered much outside of DC. he was pretty huge for a while though so maybe not  Nobody will remember Al Horford outside of maybe sixers fans. the same could be said about tobias harris. talk about unremarkable.
Probably al horford which sucks cause he‚Äôs had a solid career
"In order to do that they made their second best player, 33 year old Al Horford sit out the season healthy  They relied too much on young players late in the season, sure it‚Äôs tanking but it‚Äôs the truth. One injury doesn‚Äôt cause a team to play as bad as they did"
"They went 23-7 against the West, and actually had a better winning% against those teams than they did the East.  If you think a starting five of Kyle Korver, Paul Millsap, Al Horford, Jeff Teague and DeMarre Carroll is even remotely matching those Harden Rockets teams you're on another planet."
Compared to Oklahoma though its a whole different thing. We couldn't get free agents when we where the best team in the West. Al Horford wouldn't even come.

He‚Äôd be more respected if he didn‚Äôt only play half the games last year. The thunder shut him down and sent al horford home so they could lose games   If they were able to compete last year they‚Äôd be in the Play in tournament and people would know how good shai is at this point
that year of rest did al horford good! looking fresh
"Exactly right, and hey look at who paid Nicholson in the first place.  Ernie Grunfeld.  Did I mention Ernie missed out on prime Al Horford who had to chose between Boston and the Wizards. So then to save face turned around and paid Ian Mahinmi a 4 Year/$64 million dollar contract.  Mahinmi at this point had averaged 5ppg and 4rpg AS A CENTRE.  He would averaged 5ppg and 4rpg as a Wizard over those 4 seasons. That‚Äôs 16 million per year for 5 points and 4 rebounds a game‚Ä¶ FML"
"Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler,  Kyle Korver, John Wall, Marcus Camby, Rajan Rondo, Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, Marc Gasol, Cedric Maxwell, Lou Willians, Jamal Crawford, Kevin Love, Al Horford, Demar Derozan, Andre Igoudala, Rudy Gobert and maybe DeAndre Jordan, Isaiah Thomas and Paul Millsap should all be in the hall of fame"
Would you rather have Kobe or Al Horford?
Al Horford slander.
Historically Al has always had a very heavy preference for playing the 4.  * He played the 4 in college alongside Joakim Noah.  * A big part of him leaving Atlanta was Milsap's presence always meant he had to play the 5. Two reasons he liked Boston were that we'd let him play the 4 alongside Amir Johnson and we'd let him handle the ball and initiate the offence more.  * Then we brought in Baynes to help Horford a little more in the frontcourt with tougher assignments.  * Then a big part of him leaving Boston was the fact we'd benched Baynes to play 3-wing lineups and Philadelphia would allow him to play the 4 alongside Embiid.  He plays minutes at the 5 but he's always pushed to start at the 4.

Is that Al Horford or Hakeem Olajuwon?  It's hard to tell.
"He wasn‚Äôt pegged as a genius for his scouting abilities. He was one of the first to openly admit that for a non-destination city, drafting is the best way to acquire talent, and did his best to shoot as many shots as he could in the draft. Even though the picks ended up not being successful, the logic was right. In terms of his firing, I think people realize that a GM taking the long-view is often more beneficial than a ‚Äúget good quick‚Äù scheme, something like the Al Horford signing."
the best passer they played with Al horford when they weren‚Äôt stars &amp; maybe Kyrie or Gordon when he was in &amp; out for years
Even if years go by (which it won‚Äôt) he‚Äôs definitely not getting fired. He‚Äôs by far the Best GM the Sixers had in a very long time. In his first year here he got rid of Al Horford and flipped Josh Richardson into Seth Curry.
"&gt; Al Horford was a huge difference maker for us last year, that's why we shut him down and traded him.  Lmao"
Al Horford.. no idea why
"A big knock on Brad Stevens (whom many regarded as a good coach) early in his tenure was the lineups he put out were questionable. People freaking out over Udoka after 2 games need to settle down as things like schemes take time to implement with guys who were so used to Stevens‚Äô system (Tatum, Brown and Smart specifically). Yeah we were getting killed on the boards and turning the ball over too much, it‚Äôs gotta be fixed. Could have used Kanter for a bit there instead of Grant at the 5 in the 3Q even if his defense is abysmal, and Tatum/Brown never seem to have good games at the same time. I think it‚Äôs reasonable to question their fit if this continues through this year.  In any case, I‚Äôm not sure why the expectations were so high when all the Bradley Beal to the Celtics rumors months ago fell through and we ended up with Dennis Schroder, Josh Richardson, Al Horford and Enes Kanter, but otherwise the EXACT same team and people thought these guys would move the needle to push them to the 3 seed? It was always going to be a non-contending year and they 100% have to land a guy next off season or you can start to blame the FO for not getting the personnel they need to contend.  Sorry, but a bunch of guys who are basically 6th men/bench guys hasn‚Äôt changed that. It‚Äôs going to be another rough year for Celtics fans I think."

Man we can't rely on old Al Horford to be our highest energy player
Toronto getting destroyed on the block by an 80 year old Al Horford with his own personal block party. Low BBIQ for these young raptors...
"&gt; what ""skill"" does he have? He's really not polished at all.  Watch him from a few years ago, and the skill and polish are glaringly obvious. He was a guy who was posting and attacking good defenders, like Tristan Thompson, Al Horford, even Gobert. Not a guy who looks afraid to post up Deandre Hunter (no offense to Hunter).   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRbAdIlNASw  If you showed someone in 2018 the current KP, they'd barely recognize him."
"Shaun Livingston was rail thin compared to most NBA players' physiques, and he could still score on post ups. He couldn't in his early Clippers years, but he was damn near automatic by the time he was a Warrior because it was something he worked on.  KP has clearly regressed - this is a guy who just a few years ago, his eyes would light up if he had Tristan Thompson or Al Horford defending him in the post, and would even go right at Myles Turner or Anthony Davis.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRbAdIlNASw"
"I posted this in an r/sixers thread.  Here‚Äôs my running list:  The 30 for 30 on The Process is going to be so insane.  All the injuries to draft picks who sat our entire seasons, Fultz and Simmons baggage, the bounce shot on the Toronto series, burner/collar-gate, the Collangellos in general, Jah fighting a Celtics fan and also getting busted by the cops with a gun while speeding, Mike Scott fighting an Eagles fan during a tailgate while wearing a redskins Jersey, almost killing Zhaire Smith, Jimmy Butler in general, will Dario ever come over?, MCW won rookie of the year, wanting to re-sign Nerlens (instead of Al Horford) only to have his agent not take our calls, and now Nerlens is suing and the sixers offer might be the thing that makes his case, Adam Silver interfering with everything on behalf of the other team owners‚Ä¶.  What a wild ride we‚Äôve been on for so long."
"Guards who Ray Allen lost for All-NBA honors include  Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and Jason Kidd  Centers Dwight beat for All-NBA honors include Shaq in Phoenix, Andrew Bogut, Al Horford, Andrew Bynum, Tyson Chandler, and Knicks Amare Stoudemire.  Ray played in the deepest guard era of all time. Dwight played in the worst Center era of all time.  Allen was averaging 28 ppg before taking a reduced role to win with the Celtics. He was a couple foul calls away from the finals in 2001. He's still the 3pm record holder as of right now. His longevity was better, he has one more ring, he was the best shooter pre-curry. He was in his prime 7 years from 2000-2007  I'm nearly throwing up in my mouth having to defend Ray Allen as a Laker fan."
"Not at all lmao. Why would al Horford for example give a fuck what kd and Lebron are doing? He‚Äôs a grown ass man. He‚Äôs not gonna uproot his wife and kid and move to China just because some other players are doing that, especially when he‚Äôd be giving up a fuck ton of his money since he‚Äôs not making a fraction of his current contract overseas"
"Big Z for the Cavs, Kendrick Perkins for Boston, old Sheed/Maxiell for the Pistons, rookie Al Horford for the Hawks. Nobody to challenge him in the East playoffs.  There really was nobody else besides Yao that could rival Dwight for the top spot once Shaq declined. I remember the narrative during the 07-09 seasons for centers was ""Dwight v. Yao"" there used to be TONS of threads devoted to arguing who was better and it was a legitimate debate. Then Dwight went to the finals, Yao's feet betrayed him and the rest was history."
The Al Horford approach
What is this and why is Al Horford involved?
Any team that has al horford or Kelly olynyk. That series against the hawks with walls broken hand and pierce not being able to get that corner three off in time. Killed me to see horford get that rebound for the last second bucket. And olynyk because he fucking torched us for 30+
He‚Äôs gonna be one of those guys that‚Äôs really really good at everything. Like a more athletic Al Horford. Which is probably a superstar
Yeah but what about signing Al Horford to a massive contract and have him suck next to Embiid?
"Al Horford said a bunch of snarky shit when he left Atlanta for Boston, but it's not really even close to comparable."
"The sixers cannot trade more than 1 future FRP due to the al Horford to the thunder deal. You guys traded your 2025 frp protected to the thunder and if it doesnt convey in 2025 it will convey in 2026 or 2027. You cant trade picks in consecutive years so that gives you guys the option to either trade your 2022 FRP or 2023 FRP, you cant trade any more than that. So like I said, Ben + 1 FRP will not be the best option."
"Because of the Al Horford trade and the stepien rule the Sixers can only trade 1 future first round pick which is a 2022 or 2023 first round pick  So good luck getting Dame for Brick Simmons,Maxey and the 28th pick in the draft"
They cant trade 4 firsts because of the stepien rule and Al Horford trade they can only trade 1 future draft pick in 2022 or 2023
I am so sorry to hear this Pistons fans. We hope everything is okay and someday we will beat the shit out of you in the playoffs. Wishing a speedy recovery for Cade and Al Horford (covid).

We don't know how well he did or didn't handle this until it is over. He certainly wasn't a joke when he dumped Al Horford with one of the worst contracts in the league for value when everyone thought that was impossible.
I think with Kevin Love there's a serious chance that they just shut him down and send him away from the team similar to what OKC did with Al Horford. If the dude doesn't want a buyout then keep him away from the rest of the team.
"Hey man we gave Ian Mahinmi a 4 year, 64 million dollar contract in 2016 free agency after we struck out on Kevin Durant and Al Horford"
"Tristan Thompson, Serge Ibaka, Russ, Patrick Ewing, Jokic, Dennis Rodman, Timelord, Al Horford, Clint Capela"
Al Horford is a good comp imo
Several people were saying that. And CP3 salary size could have turned into Capela + another borderline all-star player (e.g. Al Horford)  Booker + Luka + Capela + borderline all-star player + Mikal = Suns 2021 Champion
"Hassan Whiteside, Harrison Barnes, Otto Porter, Andre Drummond, Al Horford. Max Players at one point, the stretch isn't of the imagination it's of what a max player is. He's not a super max player, but I'd argue neither is Gobert he's certainly a max player though."
"Horford played plenty of ""5"" in his first stint in Boston, and was at his best as the lone big man in Phily (bench unit with no Embiid).  I am not sure what all he did in OKC there to comment since he sat out most of the season.   But even beyond that Al isn't keeping up with wings on the perimeter, especially since he is now 35.  He was great at limiting even a guy like Embiid in the post a few years back which earned him an all defensive team, if you stick him on a ""4"" in the corner you are eliminating a lot of what he can bring you defensively."
"I personally wouldn't view Robert Williams as a better player then Horford right now, especially since Al still can space for their ISO scorers and is still a pretty solid defender.     Higher on the chart then Kanter i can get behind, but I guess Enes was fine signing to be third on the chart and barely get playing time?  He started 35 games last year would just be surprising he would go to a situation for little money and not receive some run."
"How many elite dive-and-dunk bigs double as canny passers -- capable of facilitating the offense?   The number who do both at Williams' level is really small.  And how many of those can do this to James Harden in a close playoff game?   That is the promise of the ""Time Lord"" wrapped into one nine-second sequence: switching onto one of the greatest ball handlers ever, maintaining a stance, keeping his arms out, staying balanced against all fakery, and finally rising to reject a 3-pointer from an all-time scorer unaccustomed to such rudeness.  Williams had nine blocks in that game. When asked if he remembers that one, he simply says, ""We lost. I know that."" Teammates and coaches say Williams does not care about scoring or stats -- that he only wants to win. He works hard, and shows up on time now. (Williams concedes the Time Lord nickname will follow him forever. ""It ain't going anywhere, so I accept it,"" he says.)  Williams has great hands. Only two rotation players -- Williams and Nerlens Noel -- averaged more than 1.5 steals and three blocks per 36 minutes last season, according to Basketball-Reference. The Celtics have tried everything from switching to blitzing with Williams, and he has looked at home doing all of it.  ""He has natural ability on defense that not a lot of young bigs have,"" says Al Horford, a teammate both now and during Williams' rookie season. ""From our very first pickup game, that stood out.""  The raw materials of a special two-way center are here. That's why the Celtics' front office frantically canvassed sources in the middle of the 2018 draft, trying to figure out why Williams was slipping -- whether there was some medical issue -- and if they should trade up to get him, sources say.  The issue has been consistency. Williams has played only 113 games in three seasons, due mostly to nagging injuries. As Sam Vecenie has pointed out on the Game Theory podcast, Williams has logged 30 or more minutes in exactly one game.  On defense, his fundamentals come and go. Williams sometimes stands up instead of holding his crouch, and droops his arms to his sides. ""I have to improve my stance -- my posture,"" he says. He can't resist some pump fakes. ""That's hard, trust me,"" he says, laughing.  He can rotate late, and chase blocks he has no chance at -- leaving the glass naked. He sometimes swings his arms down instead of staying vertical. Boston coaches have been on him to keep blocks inbounds instead of swatting them into the stands. Back-to-basket behemoths -- a dwindling group -- can shove him backward.  As a rookie defending pick-and-rolls, Williams often abandoned ball handlers too early to get back to his man -- conceding easy drives. Now, he sometimes overcompensates by lingering too long on the ball, allowing his man to skulk behind him for pocket passes:   Mastering that stuff takes years, but Williams is trending the right way. He became more diligent on the glass last season.  Even his passing can go haywire, though it's not always his fault. He sees the game so fast, some of his passes -- especially tip passes on offensive rebounds -- catch teammates off guard.  ""I just gotta slow it down a little sometimes,"" Williams says, ""and stop throwing so many bullets.""  The combined passing between Horford and Williams is the main reason the Celtics -- and the two principles -- are optimistic the double-big pairing can work. Horford can stretch the floor, then pump and drive, and lob to Williams in the dunker spot. Williams can orchestrate while Horford screens in off-ball split actions.  Space will open when Boston goes smaller, with only one of the Williams-Horford tandem. Williams is a cagey hand-off guy, outthinking defenses by flipping the direction of his screens and signaling his shooters to flare away for corner jumpers. He is starting to eat up the space defenses give him with hard dribbles leading into soft-touch paint shots:   He slips hard out of picks, and knows all the reads before he catches the ball: dunker spot, corner shooters, wing shooters.  The Celtics expect Williams to shoot more jumpers at some point. Posting up guards on switches will be one of the final frontiers -- something Williams hasn't done much, even as several teams, including the Brooklyn Nets in the playoffs, have switched point guards onto him.  Development is uncertain. Williams might top out as an average center; the Celtics paid him as such in his recent contract extension.  But the upside is so much higher -- like All-Star high -- and if Williams stays healthy, he's a good bet to unlock at least some of it"
"this would be the weirdest way to wrap up the story  the sixers are straight up weird and never disappoint.  Tank for a few years, league takes over, colangelo burners reveal hes trading all of hinkie's guys because he is jealous, colangelo burners in general, decide not to sign jimmy butler and redick so they can give al horford the bag, hire a gm with no experience in Elton Brand, fultz forgets how to shoot, zhaire smith almost dies, weird simmons hold out where he just shows up outside at the end of a sitcom for no reason.  It never ends if we ever win its gonna be weird af.  Like Drummond finals mvp playing 10 mins a game weird."
"For those saying wiggins is a good contract, let's look at the contracts within 3 million of wiggins aav.   KAT  Klove   Brandon Ingram  Jamal murray  Cp3  Gordon Hayward  Wiggins  Embiid  Jokic  Dlo  Julius Randle  Kyle lowry  Demar derozan  Al horford  Jaylen brown  Of these players I think there's only kevin love and al horford that wiggins is definitely better than"
"Hawks is Pistol Pete / Lou Hudson / Dominique / Bob Pettit / Mutumbo. The next best options would be Trae / Cliff Hagan / Joe Johnson / millsap or Josh Smith / AL Horford or Tree Rollins.   the first 5 listed are clearly better than their next up so it's pretty clear cut to me, the only real debate is if you really include names like Vince Carter, Moses Malone, Tracy McGrady or Shareef. they played for the hawks but it was either incredibly short amount of time, or at the end of their careers so it's unclear if you really want to count them.  if you do count them it makes it way less clear cut who the best players would be, and if you dont count them then it's pretty clear cut."
"For the record, Rose has a HoF probability of about 12% according to Basketball Reference  Behind guys like Al Horford, John Wall, Kemba Walker.  Unless he has some magical reawakening and elevates his game to MVP caliber Rose for a few years, he's not getting in."
"They count, but they're given less weight than NBA. A lot of pre-WNBA women's players got in mostly off NCAA accomplishments and of course all college coaches.  For men, it doesn't get a lot of weight compared to the NBA. Al Horford as a 2x NCAA Champ, and also 5x NBA Allstar will be a good test of whether a very good college career can swing someone into the hall or not in these days."
Point Center Al Horford
Al Horford isn‚Äôt a high ceiling
His absolute ceiling is Al Horford imo
"Embiid was always the guy with the fans.   A few were more pro-Ben.  But it was 90/10 for Embiid.   Internally you are right though.   They built a roster for Ben, even paying 100 million for a center he could play with in Horford.   It seems crazy to think that both him and Embiid would stick around for the 4 years Al was signed for."
Prime Al horford ?  Da fuck ?
"&gt; It was supposed to push for finals and not developing players.  Totally agree. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not saying Tatum, who struggled offensively, should‚Äôve gotten the ball more. That would be prioritizing Tatum‚Äôs development over the chance to win. I‚Äôm talking about giving the ball more to the players who were consistently playing better than Kyrie so that we had a better chance of winning.  Take the Bucks series. 3 out of 5 starters had a ts% of over 60% - Jaylen had a 60.2% ts, Al‚Äôs was 60.5%, and Morris‚Äô was 77.2%. Kyrie‚Äôs was 44.7%. Kyrie averaged 20.4 ppg on 20.8 fga. Jaylen and Horford each averaged 16.2 ppg. Jaylen did it on an average of 11.6 fga and Horford on 12.6. Morris averaged 14.8 ppg on 8 fga per game.   Over the course of the series, Kyrie  * Had just 21 more total pts than Al on 41 more fga * Had just 21 more total pts than Jaylen on 46 more fga * Had just 28 more total pts than Morris on 64 more fga"
"I think the opposite honestly.   People seem to give BC and his successors a pass.   They fucked up so bad it's insane.      Butler was a great trade.  But then you alienate him to the point that he wants out.    Harris(and Scott/Boban) for two future 1s and Shamet was a vast overpay.  Even moving Muscala in the deal hurt us b/c a 5 who could shoot might have helped more than the other 5's we ran out against Toronto.   Harris is the definition of good, not great player and maxing those type of players are the worst thing a team can do.  Now every decision has luxury tax implications.    Those future picks could have gotten you something better than Tobi.  You also left off them paying Horford 109 million with the last remaining cap space we had before Ben's max capped us forever.  How much better are we if we took one of those picks for Tobi and did the sign and trade for Brogdan instead.    And letting Butler go for just JRich so you would keep the cap space to do Al and lose Redick in the process.  They literally decided that around our best player, a generational 5, 2 power forwards, a wing and point guard who can't shoot.   And that's being generous b/c really they put 2 PF's(Ben/Harris) and a center(Horford).     That was the end result.    Morey comes in and with one short offseason turns JRich, Al and a future 1 into Green and Curry.   Space for everyone and the 1 seed followed.      As for Fultz, we will never know but like you said if he gets him at 3 and retains a future unprotected Kings pick....that pick was very valuable.  Sac hasn't been in the playoffs forever and people also forget the only reason we even had the 3rd pick for the Fultz trade was because the pick swap Hinkie set up conveyed to move us from 5 to 3."
"I mean, if you consider 2017-18 Al Horford to be prime Al Horford, he shot about 43% from 3 that season"
"5 all star selections the fun spot with a variety of career trajectories  Made it: Reggie Miller, Pistol Pete, Sam Jones, Bob McAdoo, David Thompson  Probably will make it: Tim Hardaway, Chauncey Billups, Chris Webber  Players still very likely to get more selections: Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler  Not making it: John Wall, Al Horford, Rudy LaRusso  Third options on important teams: Klay Thompson, Kevin Love  and several 60s/ABA guys"
"Al Horford. One of the smartest Bigs in the game, is good but not great at everything."
"This is the same org that ran Jimmy away, traded for Tobi and gave him a max and signed Al Horford. The hire was perfectly in line with their track record."
When the fuck did al horford go back to the C‚Äôs
"[Durant (before he decided to leave), Westbrook, and Billy Donovan apparently were recruiting Horford pretty hard to come to OKC back in 2016](https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5508075/okc-thunder-journal-how-close-was-al-horford-to-joining-okc), which obviously fell apart when Durant left for GS.  Also -- [Durant apparently tried to recruit Pau to OKC in 2014](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2014/11/04/kevin-durant-says-small-market-of-oklahoma-city-was-pau-gasols-primary-concern-in-free-agent-meeting-with-thunder/), but Pau wanted a city with operas  Horford was 30 and Pau was in the twilight of his career, so not sure you can consider either a superstar."
Not a full 100% of the time. Tatum for example said way back when that he'd trade himself for AD for example. I also think a player like Al Horford actually has a very good sense of his own abilities and who he's better or worse than.
"There is literal evidence that proves Embiid is talking out of his ass. Jimmy voiced the reasons why he left in both a podcast with JJ Redick and in a SI interview. None of it involved Simmons. Also, the entire basketball world knows the reason they got Horford is because Al owned Embiid in the playoffs and taking him out of the equation was seen as a big positive, and he was seen as a good insurance policy for the oft injured Embiid, not only if Joel got injured but to also allow him to rest more. Again, it had nothing to do with Simmons."
except the franchise sided with Ben for the previous 5 yrs.  The colangelo burners prove it and Embiid himself said they chose Ben over Jimmy and got Al Horford to space the floor for Ben.
Probably Gordon Hayward. Or Al horford
Would this be an Al Horford situation where he‚Äôll get benched until a trade happens?
"We might as well talk about KD's legacy as well then because it's by far way more important out of the hypotheticals.  After the 3-1 comeback from GSW does KD and Westbrook vow to get better so they can return back to the finals in 2017?  5X All-Star Al Horford, a severely underrated, unselfish glue guy was ready to sign with Thunder the same year. Oladipo, Ilyasova was traded to Thunder for Ibaka where KD said Dipo was a great pick up. We saw Dipo flourish and develop in such a small time span does KD win a ring for Oklahoma for the first time and become that childhood hero?"
"Oversized superstar PG - check  Super scoring 2 guard - check  Borderline elite 3-D player - check  Above average lob threat center - check  Just use that CP3 cap space to sign another borderline all-star 4 like Al Horford, and Suns would have had one ring right now and West conference favorite this upcoming season."
Al Horford looks good
Al Horford
"Beating Al Horford and Paul Milsap, Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry, and young PG and Roy Hibbert.  Context please.  Shaq had to go through Duncan and the Spurs, Dirk's Mavricks, Webber and the Kings, Nash and Stoudemire, prime KG, Pippen's Blazers.  All of those teams were better than anything Lebron faced during his 8 straight Finals.  Shaq actually had competition before the Finals.  Lebron did not.  Lebron's Finals run is one of the most overrated accomplishment in sports history."
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
"Look I‚Äôm not about to argue w you over the hypothetical roster GSW would‚Äôve gotten had KD not joined. I‚Äôm and not going to argue about whether GSW w Harrison Barnes and Al Horford is better than GSW w KD. The point remains, KD made major contributions to that team, and GSW would not have won two back to back chips without him. You don‚Äôt want to give him credit bc of arbitrary ‚Äúcontext‚Äù and you seem prepared to die on that hill. So there‚Äôs really no debate to be had here."
"We‚Äôre gonna act like 2019 never happened? The warriors were still contenders without Durant. Not ‚Äúbest post season record‚Äù prohibitive favorites, but still capable of winning. If he doesn‚Äôt sign they still could‚Äôve retained Harrison Barnes or gotten Al Horford (a stretch 5 to add size and defense to the death lineup).   Wade won in 2006. In 2008 the heat won 43 games 43 games, missing the playoffs then won 47 games followed by a first round gentlemen‚Äôs sweep in 2009. The warriors won 67 wins and the championship then won 73 and were one possession away from repeating. That comparison is ridiculous"
I'm legit wondering if the Cavs will shut him down for the season like OKC did for Al Horford
Al Horford for Simmons. Who knows  maybe Horford would play great next to Embiid ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Fuck al horford man I was at that game lmfao
"Which players in the East from Lebron's eight year run will be in the Hall, in your opinion?  You say we don't know because we are not far enough removed.  I feel we have a pretty good idea right now whether or not Paul Milsap or Al Horford deserve to be in the Hall.  Demar Derozan has shown us enough to say he isn't a Hall of Famer.  I don't think Lowry has done enough to make the Hall, and if he does, it would be almost entirely because Kawhi dragged him to a title.  PG has a decent chance, but I'm not sure he has done enough yet.  Plus, PG was far from his prime in those early Pacer days.  It is all opinion in the end.  There is no way to say with any certainty that the 97 Heat would beat the 60 win Hawks or Raptors.  I can't say for sure, but it is my opinion that the Heat would indeed win.  I watched those Heat teams.  I watched those Hawks and Raptors teams.  I would take the 97 Heat over any team Lebron beat during his eight year run.    I do think looking at how many Hall of Famers were battling in the conference gives us a good indication of just how competitive that conference was.  When talking specifically about Hall of Fame credentials a couple years ago, Zach Lowe and his guests on his podcast discussed how the Eastern Conference over the proceeding decade had skewed the notion that having ""x"" number of all star appearances helped make a players case for the Hall.  They were debating whether or not the all star appearances in the East should count as 2/3 or 3/4 of an appearance based on how weak the talent level in the East has been.  The Eastern Conference being a joke for that entire decade is pretty universally accepted.  Are you arguing that the East was not incredibly weak during that stretch?"
"2017-2018 Celtics.   Core of Kyrie, Hayward, Al Horford with Rozier, Brown, Smart, Tatum, Theis in the periphery  They wouldn't have beaten the Warriors but they probably could've won the East that year"
Al Horford?
"Al Horford back, Marcus Smart contract extension, Ime Udoka coaching.  Must be a nice change of pace for Celtics fans from a few years ago lol"
Advance statistics are overrated. Al Horford had a higher win shares than Kobe during the 2009-10 regular season. Was he better than Kobe? Gasol was very good in Memphis as the first option but he got his as(s) whooped in the playoffs three straight years without winning a single playoff game. Gasol benefitted from having Kobe‚Äôs presence on his team as a Laker. Check his career shooting percentage with the Grizzlies and compare that with his Lakers‚Äô shooting percentages. His Lakers‚Äô shooting percentage overall was a lot higher.
That would just be Al Horford 2.0 lol
"And now Sixers would have to give up a haul of assets + Simmons to get Lavine lol and Bulls probably still say no  Also that thread is wild, people saying Lavine should be traded for Danny green, Kuzma and pick 28. Or Lavine for Al Horford and 2 picks."
3 team trade  Raptors get: Al Horford  Utah gets: Goran dragic  Celtics get: Donovan Mitchell
"Al Horford wouldve been the most notable free agent signings for at least a few franchises, including the Wolves and the grizzlies."
"We get FA because you have to have 15 players every year. The only recent notable FA‚Äôs we signed were JJ Redick, and that‚Äôs because we overpaid 1 year when we were below the cap. Second was Al Horford so I guess that‚Äôs someone but other than that? We don‚Äôt get good FA‚Äôs lol"
Not just the wolves.  Look at who the most notable free agent signings have been for teams like the grizzlies.  Im not just talking about shit teams like the wolves.  When the sixers signed Al horford a couple years ago - that wouldve been the most notable signing for the grizzlies
"so Robert Williams and Al Horford are just, like, window dressing, then"
Ime udoka said they know what they have in Al horford (at this point we can assume he is the likely starter probably) and they wanted to just test out other combinations.
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"Because Embiids backups have been guys like Richaun Holmes, Amir Johnson, Boban, Greg Monroe, and Dwight Howard. When he did play with the type of center he thinks he‚Äôd fit with, Al Horford, he had better net ratings than he did with Embiid that year."
Crazy that it applies every time outside of al horford. Sixers sign a tall white guy who can shoot challenge lol.
Simmons and embiid are holding each other back. The numbers show they work together. But thats just due to raw talent levels of both players. It's clear that Ben succeeds with a center who shoots and embiid needs a point guard who can shoot and penetrate. Both players benefit from an open paint. Embiid would be an unstoppable monster if he had even McCollum let alone harden or Lillard. Ben also played his best with a stretch 5. There  was that 16 game win streak in his rookie year without embiid. He also did well playing with al horford. I think that's what ben means by that statement. They play well together but they aren't reaching their individual peaks.
"here are some fun stats. the first list below is the top 20 accrued Win Shares for anyone born outside of the US, and the second is the top 20 WS / 48 by the same criteria  'Nique is about as foreign as Kobe and this cross-section misses obv. folks like Tony Parker but i thought it interesting   *Foreign-ish WS Total*  * Tim Duncan * Dirk Nowitzki * Hakeem Olajuwon * Pau Gasol * Steve Nash * Patrick Ewing * Dominique Wilkins * Dikembe Mutombo * Tony Parker * Detlef Schrempf * Manu Gin√≥bili * Vlade Divac * Al Horford * Marc Gasol * Peja Stojakoviƒá * Carlos Boozer * Rudy Gobert * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Rolando Blackman * Kiki Vandeweghe  *Foreign-ish WS / Game*  * Boban Marjanoviƒá * Nikola Jokiƒá * Rudy Gobert * Tim Duncan * Clint Capela * Yao Ming * Arvydas Sabonis * Chris Boucher * Dirk Nowitzki * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Joel Embiid * Manu Gin√≥bili * Ivica Zubac * Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas * Dwight Powell * Tiago Splitter * Hakeem Olajuwon * Pau Gasol * Kyrie Irving * Todd MacCulloch"
Won't happen but Al Horford would be cool. He's been great.
"&gt;He‚Äôs been a positive contributor on the court and completely outplayed Horford recently as the primary big man  Well that's a lie and you should feel bad for thinking a Celtics fan is just going to eat your bullshit.   Over the last 5 games, Al is averaging 10 points and 8.4 rebounds (whilst being in a massive slump on his 3pt shot). The Turkish git is averaging 6.6 points and 7.8 rebounds. Let's look at the last game against Raptors - Al got 17/11 in 26 mins, Kanter went 9/10 in 22 mins.   We're not going to even bother with defensive metrics because obvious reasons, but even using offense alone (I.e Kanter's only forte) you're full of shit.   &gt;he‚Äôs the only person in the league willing to address any of those issues  People say all sorts of shit behind the protection of social media. Oh wow, he trolled someone via Twitter, he sure is such a brave man!   &gt;I think his basic point is that we at least have political and legal freedoms/protections here which is completely true  Funny way of making that point eh? Shut up and don't criticise your country, you have no idea how good you have it is either dumb (because events outside one's country have absolutely no effect on that person's view of their own country) or malicious (because having the legal freedoms/protections in the first place means the individual can and should criticise the country's failures or shortcomings). Either way, he can fuck right off.   &gt;Try supporting LGBTQ or minority interests in countries like China or Turkey. You can‚Äôt.  Don't really care, am not in China/Turkey and my team doesn't play there either. Enes should however travel and wage his noble battle there. Everyone will come out winning from it."
"Thank God for Danny Ainge throwing that max Kemba's way after Kyrie's move.   Weirdly, everyone involved still managed to get a decent haul out of Kemba (progressively smaller one at that). Hornets got Terry, Celtics got Al Horford, Thunder got a pick, Knicks got to pick him up on the cheap."
Holy crap that pass by Willy lol. Somewhere Al Horford just flinched.
Idk if you wanna watch that series or not but we were terrible defensively because our guards couldn't stay in front of anything and we were playing an injured Al Horford at the 4 guarding Jaylen Brown.
In the trash east against Demar Derozan and Al Horford.
Eh  Lowkey Marcus smart is at his career average for 3s so I don‚Äôt expect that to get better Al horford def should return to the mean hopefully
"It's a bit of both. With that being said we have a few guys like Smart, Tatum, Nesmith, Pritchard, and Al Horford who are mired in big shooting slumps. On the flip side we have a couple of guys like Grant Williams and Romeo Langford who are shooting better than their profile. We suck at shooting in aggregate, but we're also shooting worse than we probably should be."
I‚Äôm old enough to remember Brad Stevens getting laughed at for moving Kemba for Al Horford.
Let me put it this way: Kobe had more assists when he played with smush parker and kwame brown than Tatum has playing with Jaylen Brown and Al Horford. The quality of teammates isn't the issue. His attitude is.

shoutout 35 year old al horford for quietly dropping a double-double
Montrezl Harrell and Al Horford
"Potential Lineups:  Toronto ‚Äì Fred VanVleet, Svi Mykhailiuk, Scottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam, Precious Achiuwa  Boston ‚Äì Dennis Schroder, Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford  Not very promising for us"
"Sounds like an Al Horford, John Wall agreement"
"depends on where you think his best position   so many people just want to stick him in the post and ask him to guard people like al horford   i don‚Äôt. i want him to be a perimeter player. his passing is so good that i would pine for him to be our main playmaker if we didn‚Äôt have darius garland   we have Allen to bang down low with people. if they want to go big to defend Mobley, then the Cavs will run a Mobley/DG PnR (yes, DG will be the screener) and the cavs will get the switch, as they have down time and time again   go watch mobley from last night, he‚Äôs hitting pull ups and taking dudes off the bounce with regularity (truly looked like the only thing he was told was ‚Äúscore the fuckin ball‚Äù)  Mobley himself has said he wants to be a perimeter player. i agree he needs to get stronger and put on muscle, but not because it‚Äôs going to make him able to ‚Äúbang in the post‚Äù it‚Äôs because he will get quicker, he will be able to jump higher, and he will be able to absorb more contact when he drives   mobley needs to be off-ball and weak side as much as possible to maximize his defensive impact. he‚Äôs so good at getting switched onto smaller guys and also helping from the weak side. if allen and mobley force you to play 2 guys who don‚Äôt have 3 point range, the paint is instantly shut off and the guards can now gamble all night   Mobley needs to bulk up as much as Bill Russell did"
"Definitely feelin‚Äô the Julius Randle - Z-Bo comparison although Julius is more perimeter oriented with a better handle and playmaking. Z-bo‚Äôs footwork/positioning, low-to-mid-post game was top notch. Maybe someone like prime Paul Millsap?   Sheed is a harder comparison‚Ä¶ maybe Al Horford? Or someone like prime Serge Ibaka with way less blocks and a much more refined post game? Hard to find players with Sheed‚Äôs offensive low post skills, ability to stretch the floor, AND provide All-NBA level defense and major swagger‚Ä¶ loved Sheed! He was always a top level talent that gave zero f*@ks about how you viewed him. Was definitely the x-factor/missing piece on that awesome 2004 Detroit Piston Championship team."
"You‚Äôre a absolutely right. AD had that one great shooting stretch in the playoffs and now he thinks he‚Äôs Dirk. Every time he settles for a jumper the defense is relieved but not only that, if he had more drive and a sense of urgency he‚Äôd be a sure fire top 5 player. As for LeBron, he‚Äôs settling for more 3s too and he‚Äôs struggling to get by guys like Alex Len and Al Horford. Now that could be either injury related, because I think he came back early, or age related. Either way both of these guys aren‚Äôt playing with enough effort."
"Is there a bot posting this shit? Giannis put on a lot of weight, became overwhelmingly powerful and is still very agile. Dwight when he came into the league also put on a lot of weight and was still a monster as a pick n roll defender and as a help defender. He needs to put on weight, did you see how old man and undersized Center Al Horford bullied him the last game just before the injury? The guy is rail thin. It is actually more important for his offensive potential that he puts on weight, not even defense. It will help him get to the line more, he is already a decent free-throw shooter, it will help him bully smaller players in the post too."
"Carmelo's two biggest issues defensively are that he has never totally cared on that end and that his lateral mobility is just nonexistent nowadays, despite him being probably in better shape than he ever was in his prime.    But part of it is also just mental. He has never been a great help/rotational defender. He's never been a guy who gets to the perfect spot all the time, or plays the perfect angle. Like old Blake is still a pretty useful defender because he just knows what to do, and is willing to do whatever. Steph is a fine defensive player because he just knows what to do and where to be, and he tries. Al Horford has been in the exact right place and made the exact right decision on every single play for like 15 straight years. Tim Duncan's mobility absolutely stunk in later years, and he was still always in the right spot, and was pretty damn effective regardless of physical limitations.  Melo is not *more* physically limited than late-career Duncan, you know?"
"thats because all davis does is take it to the rack, embiid has a much better arsenal and can score in far more ways.  Yes these are this year's RAPTOR. Let's look at last years:  Embiid oRaptor: +3.8, dRaptor: +4.6  Davis oRaptor: +1.0, dRaptor: +2.7  It becomes clear that Embiid is far more important.  Now if we look at 19-20 season:  Format: (Player ORaptor DRaptor)  Embiid +0.7, +3.4 (note this is the year with Al Horford, probably the worst built lineup yet)  Davis +3.1, +4.3 so the last time Davis was more important than embiid is when the sixers were constructed embarrassingly bad. Note that the Lakers did win a chip this year though  Any years before this is when AD was a Pelican."
"POBO Brad built a defense-focused team in the most prolific offensive era in the history of the game. They basically just banked on the Jays scoring ~30 each every night and figured everyone else could throw in whatever bullshit came their way, and shut everyone down on defense to make up for it. But the Jays almost never have great games on the same night, and more importantly one of them is always out of the lineup, so we are left depending on Marcus Smart, Dennis Schroder, Al Horford and Josh Richardson to make up for it, which they can't do.   On top of that, Tatum has really bought in to his own hype, and gives the defense the absolute easiest task of just standing around and watching him Iso into a sidestep 3 as his main scoring preference. He has had a couple of games when he has made a clear effort to not do that, and he has looked unstoppable, and his rebounding and passing have both improved dramatically this year, but he just can't get past defaulting to playground ball, and the worst part is that we don't really have the roster to prove to him that he can defer sometimes to make the defense think and work a bit.   Basically, our team sucks in both roster construction and execution."
We‚Äôll never know. We would‚Äôve signed al horford as well that off season if KD stayed. Would‚Äôve been a fun season that‚Äôs for sure
"You're insane if you think Morey is getting fired. In his first year he got rid of the Al Horford Contract, Got Seth Curry for Josh Richardson, Then got Dwight and then Drummond. That man will never see a Pink Slip from the Sixers."
Probably the same reason they didn‚Äôt force the Thunder to play Al Horford last season
Al Horford would like a word
Al Horford giving the pep talks. Im dead lmaooo this team is down horrendous
"CP3 trade was bad? You do know how close that team was taking down the historically great Warriors.   And let‚Äôs see, he discovered Patrick Beverly, Chandler Parson, Clint Capella, Tyrese Maxey. Traded for Seth Curry, got rid of Al Horford contract while picking up Danny Green. Harden trade was definitely not his only good transaction.   Oh, btw. Simmons was the one who requested the trade. Team fined him when he claimed that he had mental issue m, but refused to cooperate and provide any update.  If you tell you boss you need a mental break. Your boss will probably let you take few days off. But after taking a break for couple weeks, don‚Äôt you think your boss has the right to ask you provide any update or a give them a doctor note?"
So if you were given the option you would diminish the role of Al Horford so Enes Kanter can play more?
"Is it your opinion that Enes Kanter is a better basketball player, and one who contributes to winning more, than Al Horford and the Timelord?"
"We were missing our two best players on the team in Kyrie and Hayward. You guys had 23 and 12 all star starter Embiid and Rookie of the year Ben Simmons. You guys legit had the best two players in the series at that time and got beat 4-1 by a team with a 19 year old Tatum, 21 year old Brown and Al Horford. All I‚Äôm saying is wanting to take Embiid over both Tatum and Brown wouldn‚Äôt make that much sense to me being that Tatum and Brown have accomplished more than Embiid has and that‚Äôs including Embiid getting to play with Jimmy Butler"
"So moving on from a washed overpaid Kemba and getting Al Horford who has been awesome for us was indicative of significant chemistry issues?    Celtics FO consulted with players when identifying the next head coach, definitely sounds like a lot of tension there too lol  if you said that we lack effort and playmaking sure, but the players themselves have consistent denied the ‚Äúreported‚Äù chemistry issues"
"I'd say there is a small, but not insignificant chance that Houston is able to trade him this off-season. I only say that because of what happened with Al Horford in OKC last year. Everyone assumed that contract was unmovable, until another unmovable contract came along and they were exchanged.    That said, Wall is making more than Horford, and is definitely not the player that Horford is at this point. So I'd say it is like an 80% chance he finishes this season in Houston, then agrees to a ~$20M-$25M buyout next year and signs for a small contract to play elsewhere.    But yes, I would be pretty surprised if he doesn't play again. It just wont be in Houston."
"The Sixers, for most of a season, started Ben Simmons, Josh Richardson, Tobias Harris, Al Horford, and Joel Embiid. Please don't ask us questions like this."
Al Horford
"&gt;CHA: Lamelo, Miles Bridges, PJ Washington &amp; a 1st  &gt;BOS: Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart &amp; Al Horford   &gt;PHX: Booker &amp; Ayton  Those are the only teams I see with good enough assets and Luka brings his winning style of basketball to these teams."
"Oh, I have a few of these.  1. I hope Al Horford never wins a ring for starting the end of TJ Ford's career. 2. I hope the Raptors never retire Vince's jersey. He can go in the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame for his contributions to basketball in Canada. 3. Related to the above, I hope Alonzo Mourning steps on a piece of Lego every day for the rest of his life."
"Mobley's numbers this season are identitical to Al's career numbers.   **Per 100 Possessions**  Mobley: 21.5pts/11.8reb/3.6ast/1.5stl/2.5blk on 55.5% TS  Horford: 21.9pts/13.0reb/5.2ast/1.3stl/1.9blk on 56.8% TS  Furthermore, Mobley is on pace to make All Defense this season, something Al's only ever done once.    Mobley's floor is basically Al Horford but skinny as fuck, thus Toothpick Al Horford. Almost certainly will be much better than that though."
"what does that even mean for your floor to be ""toothpick"" Al Horford? Is Mobley a 4x all-star at the very very least?"
Cade's floor: Kyle Anderson  Cade's ceiling: Khris Middleton with better playmaking  Green's floor: Marshon Brooks   Green's ceiling: Jordan Clarkson  Mobley's floor: Toothpick Al Horford  Mobley's ceiling: Kevin Garnett
"I do not want the process 76s to win a ring. I hate egregious losing for seasons on end. They made zero effort to win. Same with modern day OKC, how they got away with just not playing Al Horford for the last 30 odd games is unbelievable. We all just seemed to laugh it off."
"Also can't forget Al's primary offensive skillset is all based around setting screens and making plays out of screens.   Ben Simmons isn't really a PnR PG. Brett Brown wasn't really a PnR coach. They also didn't really have any PnR guards coming off the bench. The only capable PnR ball-handler you had was Tobias Harris and it took a while for the team to figure that out, you weren't really using him in PnRs that year.   I've always said, signing Al Horford and not letting him set screens is like signing JJ Redick and not letting him shoot 3s."
"al horford and robert williams sharing the floor (110 minutes): +6.39, including a 95.45 defensive rating  He can still play PF. The problem was, embiid and simmons were basically both centers offensively, tobias harris was a power forward, and josh richardson was bad. Adding a big man in horford to that mess of a lineup just made it even worse."
Are you... are you AFunkyDiabetic?  I‚Äôm your biggest fan.  Try Al Horford highlights again.
They have to. Otherwise Lebron's gonna be flinching like he's Al Horford rebounding Free Throws everytime Beef Stew looks his way.   Still some bullshit.

"Al Horford quietly making a case for at least all defense, maybe DPOY. Tied for 3rd in blocks, guards everyone 1-5 every night he plays due to our switch everything scheme, getting a sustainable 8 boards a game (expect some of the more eye popping numbers to even out). Celtics defense has been one of the best in the NBA lately. If our record continues to improve to around top 4 seed, expect to hear more about it because it's overshadowing how great he's been overall, especially defensively."
"Cavs had a bunch of bad players, traded them all at the deadline for other bad players, but won their first game as a new squad. They proceeded to still suck the rest of the year, getting carried by Lebron who pretty much singlehandedly willed them to the finals. The Cavs narrowly beat the Pacers led by Oladipo in 7, Lebron went god mode to sweep Toronto (which is why it was extra embarassing and they looked to get kawhi for derozan), and then Celtics without Hayward or Kyrie led by Al Horford and rookie Tatum took Lebron to 7 again. Lebron willed them to the finals, nearly stole game 1 from Golden State (a team predicted to sweep the Cavs), but JR Smith didn't know how the clock worked and cost Lebron a win in one of his best performances ever."
Al horford always flinches. Always.
He had al horford for a bit at the start of last season
"Then imagine hearing at that time that Doc and the Big 3 all left soon after and Al Horford of the Hawks would be our vet leader 4/6 last years.  After the 08 playoffs and further games, I never would‚Äôve thought he‚Äôd be such a big Celtic player."
"Bro Al Horford is chunky af, and he simply knows how to rebound. Grant williams as well, to a lower degree. I don't think it's outrageous to get out rebounded by Horford give the man his respect."
Sixers told me Al Horford was ass
How you gonna get out-rebounded _and_ outscored in the paint when the tallest two people on our team were Al Horford and Grant Williams. WTF.
Also I like how AD manages to have a 30 point game and its on ancient Al Horford
"Al Horford is an elite role player, he really is. The small things he does, I don't know if anyone does it better than him and Draymond"
"Lmao AL Horford wasn't even close to one of your worse pieces that year, he was just a bad fit and your coach had no idea how to play him. Literally the next year okc had to sit him bc he was contributing to winning too much."
the AL Horford part had me rolling ü§£
Wait why did Al Horford pull up lol
When Al Horford pulled up I lost my shit
"I dont disagree but his shot profile is actually better than last yr lol which I think is telling. One problem is he's not really a rim runner or the type of guy who can get that many easy shots for himself off ball. Part of that is you have to always play with a true 5 like Mitch or Noel itll clog the paint but that's kind of always been the trade off with what Thibs wants defensively. They can probably use him a little more in the high post or DHO game(ie Al Horford or something) but his playstyle also just kind of is what it is, he'll always have the ball a fair bit and is methodical"
"This is a situation Morey inherited.  All the moves made since he took over (trading JRick for Seth Curry, Dumping bum ass Al Horford for basically nothing) have been stellar."
"Imagine never makings a finales appearance despite having Kyrie, Tatum, Brown, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford and those picks"
Al Horford as the getaway driver killed me. Fantastic
"Brogdon + LeVert, which is really just a package for Brogdon given LeVert's injury history, was offered like a week into the offseason. I'm not entirely sure we'll net a better player all around, but it's far from an obvious move to make. I wouldn't jump at the first offer either, no matter who I'm trading. Overall most of the packages were for the Buddy Heild/Malik Beasley types. People keep saying we ""fucked up"" because there was some nice package we just turned down. That's not what happened this summer.  &gt;The 76ers are straight up a better basketball team without Simmons. Adding Brogdon and Levert would have been great additions.  Absolute lies lmao this team is a better offensive fit around Embiid, but we are not a better team. Our defense is below average and a lineup of Maxey/Curry/Brogdon/Tobias/Embiid is not that good in the east anyway.  We could be a better team in October/November/December if we had already traded him for role players, but that doesn't serve our long term goals no matter how you cut it.   &gt;Over the summer Morey was sending clown offers like Simmons for Lillard and Simmons for FVV+4th overall+OG Anunoby.  I think the GM of 15+ years knows what he's doing when he calls other people around the league lol. If you read at all about how trades get made it's rather informal and GM's talk all the time. Daryl, is also known for being the most active GM calling other teams with crazy offers and that hasn't hurt his stock, shunned him from the league, or prevented him from making good deals like he did with Josh Richardson and Al Horford.   There's things to criticize from our side for sure, but I would 100% rather wait for Minnesota to be desperate 30 games into the season than trade Ben literally weeks after he had the worst few games of his career."
"Our head coach and star player did not shit on him lol. Doc said he didn't know if he was a championship PG and Embiid said the passed up dunk was the turning point in the game.  The main issue is exactly what you said, a guy shooting 33% from the FT line and failing to make a FG in the 4th quarter of games 5, 6, and 7. NBA GM's have thousands of minutes of footage of Ben and can weigh the positives and negatives.  Most people believe in Morey because his 15+ year track record is pretty good and what he did for the sixers day 1 was trade Josh Richardson for Seth Curry and get off the Al Horford contract. Nobody is sucking his dick we just think this strategy is our best option. Trading him for Buddy Heild closes our championship window anyway, might as well rebuild if that's what we wanted to do"
"He's been one of the most active GM's on the trade market for years, what are you talking about? This doesn't change the fact he traded Josh Richardson and Al Horford the second he got to Philly. Other GM's actually tend to enjoy doing business with him"
"Bro, we went from Hinkie getting sacked by the league, to a dude who beyond being a terrible GM in trades and the draft, was literally calling out his best player on twitter on burner accounts, to Elton Brand who never had any experience in that type of role and spent the last amount of cap space on Al Horford.  Morey came into this shitty Ben situation, and was not helped at all by Doc after the playoffs. With zero cap space, Morey traded Josh Richardson for Curry, somehow got off the Horford contract without hemorraging blood, drafted Tyrese Maxey, brought in Danny Green, etc. The Ben Simmons situation has always been 24/7 drama, no one in the organization is actually that upset he's gone, if anything it's galvanized everyone else on the roster. I know everyone loves to shit on Philly and Morey, but just caving and trading Ben bc you feel you have to right this second isn't helpful."
"Dwight absolutely deserved to make it, but this argument is misleading. His prime was during the worst center era in NBA history. Every year he got first place these were the runner ups.  07-08: Amare Stoudemire, Yao Ming  08-09: Yao Ming, Shaq  09-10: Amare Stoudemire, Andrew Bogut  10-11: Amare Stoudemire, Al Horford  11-12: Andrew Bynum, Tyson Chandler"
It's Al Horford
"Most overrated GM in league has in one calendar year done the following, but please, go on, tell me more   \-Flipped Al Horford for Danny Green  \-Acquired seth curry for some guy named josh richardson  \-Signed Niang/Korkmaz to below market deals, currently both wayyyy outperforming their contracts  \-Drafted Tyrese Maxey"
Shouldn't have been playing center with his build.  That's on the Cavs.  He was being tossed around by Al Horford of all people.
"Yeah, people confused Al Horford not being worth what Philly was paying him with Al Horford being washed. He just wasn‚Äôt a good fit on a team with Embiid/Simmons/Harris, especially not for that much money."
Al Horford and Marc Gasol. The two boogeymen of big man nightmares.

"Former Hawks:  PG: Dennis Schroeder  SG: Tim Hardaway Jr.  SF: Paul Millsap  PF: Mike Muscala  C: Al Horford  Bench: Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, DeAndre Bembry, Taurean Prince, Dwight Howard, Dewayne Dedmon  Thank goodness for Trae."
"You mean Schroder and Al?  Smart had a turnover, a bad pass to Tatum that forced him to travel, a tough pass to Horford that caused another turnover and a fadeaway foot on the line jumper with 12 on the clock.  Threw away 4 possessions in the final stretch.  Hardly call that a big performance.  &amp;#x200B;  Meanwhile the Cavs tried to attack Al and he held his own on the perimeter, hit a huge 3 and got a nice roll on a Schroder pass for an easy 2."
Al Horford was a welcome presence. Absolutely made a big difference vs last game when he was out. Such a good defender on big guys
Still pretty good. Celts pretty much switched off him whenever they could. Couple big plays per usual tho. Time lord was a much rougher matchup offensively (Mobley defending) for him but al horford had his number on defense.
"Ah the Al Horford revenge game after an embarrassing loss, just the player we expected to have a bounce back game"
Al Horford just gave Mobley his welcome to the NBA moment
"Are Cavs fans supposed to hate Kyle Kuzma? If six that's new to me. I only have Carlos Boozer, Al Horford, and Joakim Noah in my ""basketball players all Cavs fans hate"" list."
Embiid has had Josh Richardson and Al Horford as starters. The best just offensive player he's had was one way JJ Redick. Murray is better than any teammate Embiid has had.
Right now his role is to keep the bench warm for old al horford. Without actually being in the front office I can‚Äôt give you an answer as to why he was brought in.
"To add onto this, Robert Williams is playing 14 more mpg than his previous career high and playing well in those minutes, and Al Horford has looked more energetic than most expected. It 100% is expected that the vet min injury insurance signing hasn‚Äôt gotten run yet given those things."
Al Horford
"Not trying to sound snarky but Udoka's response in the thread here is exactly why: ""We're switching a lot and doing some things that probably are not as natural for him and that's limited his time to some extent""  I forget where I heard it but I think the Celtics are switching *by far* more than any team in the league. The only bigs we are playing at this point are Robert Williams, Al Horford, Grant Williams. They might not be able to defend quicker guards, but all three of them can at least hang with wings. The *second* we put Kanter (or Jabari Parker) on the court, the entire defensive scheme has to change."
Al Horford
Al Horford has been great
"The thunder with Oladipo, Sabonis(coulda still made the PG trade), Jerami Grant and Al Horford would've had a good shot."
They definitely milked it and sat them longer because they wanted to be worse. Also Al horford
"yah this isn't the same situation at all, I'm sure they'd love to trade Wall but no other team in the league wants that contract so there's no buyers.   He's still getting laid his max salary, is very involved with the team, and is getting a lot of time to work on his body and rehab, which definitely allow him to extend his career like we've seen with Al Horford &amp; Blake Griffin"
Ok but don't underestimate how rudderless the Celtics are without Jaylen Brown and Al Horford.
"People talk about a ""downsizing"" in the league, but that has primarily occurred at the 4, not the 5. Most traditional power forwards have now either shifted to center if they are big enough (plus some guys just get older and slower and sort of ""age into"" the position), and/or expand out to the three-point line. Kevin Love and Paul Millsap starting shooting threes. Lamarcus Aldridge and Al Horford are centers now. AD slides between the 4 and 5. Ibaka went from regular PF to stretch center. A lot of 4's now are just big wings. Mmmm, big wings."
"Kyle Korever, Paul Millsap, Al Horford"
26 year old al horford
Happy to have Al Horford instead now. Worth the loss of the first round pick.
Yeah we halted the progression &amp; growth of the young al horford so he would be available for a trade...

And if you dedicate your entire life to Al Horford then there is something seriously wrong with you
You can support an entire team despite hating one player. Ask literally the entire sixers sub last year when we had Al Horford.
Al Horford is apparently the difference maker in OKC

"Basketball reference has a cool [HoF Prob](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html) stat that tracks their understanding of the player's chances to be in the HoF based on accolades, stats, and a few random other factors (for some reason, height?) that I've dug into pretty deep. I can get into it a little if you're interested, but it's a little overly conservative and can't really take coaching experience or cultural impact into account, so it really breaks for some obvious ones (Don Nelson and Drazen Petrovic both show as no chance essentially)  Anyhow, they have Rose at a 12% chance, just behind Al Horford and just ahead of Bernard King (who is in the Hall). Cousins is all the way down at a 1.5% chance, just behind Larry Siegfried and ahead of Scott Wedman. Per this specific measurement, Drummond actually already has a better chance at the HoF than Boogie - as do DeAndre Jordan, Paul Millsap, IT, etc.  For what it may be worth, per this stat, best player not to make the HOF yet despite eligibility is Bosh, who has a 99.51% chance, but was only eligible one year. Second place is Larry Foust, a star C from the 50s, with a 94.2% chance, an third is Chauncey Billups, with an 84.4% chance."
Al Horford has done this? Damn he's a good shooter that's weird
I dont have one personally but my friend hates evan turner and al horford because they have ‚Äògay eyes‚Äô smh
I think Morey is more responsible for that by dumping Al Horford and basically rebuilding a new version of the 2018 team.
"Nah bro, get Christian Wood some help! Trade a couple picks for a veteran guard and big man. Something like this maybe:  John Wall/George Hill/Christian Wood/PJ Tucker/Al Horford  Man that gets y‚Äôall in the playoffs for sure!!"
Al Horford was terrible though.  It wasn't just fit.
Lmfao  Al Horford = James Harden?  LMFAOOOOOO
"We said this about the sixers when they signed al horford. Talent is important, but so is fit. This nets fit is questionable"
I was clearly talking about Al Horford
"There were a lot of talented centers masquerading as PFs back then, the league wasn‚Äôt totally ready to commit to small ball yet. Guys like Pau Gasol and Al Horford would be unambiguous centers today but split a lot of votes as PFs for all-nba"
"1. Bradley Beal FOR Pascal Siakam  2. Bradley Beal FOR Jrue Holiday  3. Bradley Beal FOR Tyler Herro, Andre Iguodala, Kelly Olynk  4. Bradley Beal FOR Ben Simmons  5. Bradley Beal FOR Al Horford, 4 1st Round picks  6. Bradley Beal FOR Jamal Murray  7. Bradley Beal FOR Eric Bledsoe, JJ Redick, 2 1st Round picks  8. Bradley Beal FOR Kemba Walker, Payton Pritchard  Which of these trades is the best?"
How do you feel about Al Horford?
No one was asking that when y'all had Horford. That was the whole reason the 6ers picked up Al. And last year the 76ers were just an awfully constructed team.
By not playing the Lakers and starting Al Horford
So the 2015-2016 or any of the 60 win raptor teams with al horford is a super team? Give your head a shake.
Oh I'd love al horford if he was bought out
Yeah I mean KG and Pierce were not even close to like last year on the Hawks Al Horford/Paul Millsap when they were traded to the Nets. I‚Äôd be shocked if either any of those picks end up a good a player as Harden or that Harden will be even remotely close to as bad as Pierce and KG were at the time. Hell even 50% of current Harden is more valuable than Pierce and KG were at the time lol.
Like you could probably trade him for Al Horford or something but why even bother
And al horford is gonna push philly to 60 wins
okc for al horford and a second
"His conditioning is so much better than last year. Combined with the fact that he doesn‚Äôt have to play with al horford, this is the best we‚Äôve seen joel play"
Having Al Horford playing with him literally drew two extra defenders in the paint.
"he also said he was playing more passive trying to get others involved, unfortunately those others were trash aka al horford."
Trading young talent for expiring vets is exactly how we ended up with Al Horford making 109 million dollars while having no depth
True. CP3 definitely turned people's perception of him around in that year with OKC though. Not sure if someone like Al Horford who turns 35yo in a couple months and is GTD 69M over the next 3 years can do the same. Hill possibly though.
"Your best player is al Horford. King James, AD, Kuzma, Caruso, KCP, Trez, THT are better"
I know but I already gave up on this week. Lol dude I‚Äôm playing has Embiid and KD and Embiid just dropped 94 on me and my only player playing tonight is Al fucking Horford Lol.
"ah yes the hyper athletic center, al horford"
playing with 2 other centers in ben simmons and al horford will do this to anybody
We played him with Al Horford. Literally that‚Äôs it
Obviously it wasn‚Äôt all his fault but that is simply not true. Al Horford wasn‚Äôt good last year.
1 lightly used Al Horford
"Yes they did. Al Horford when asked about playing with Kyrie said it was difficult. He also said this:   &gt;‚ÄúI just think that if Kyrie would have stayed, I don‚Äôt know if it would have worked. There would have had to be some major changes as far as players, because it was just clear that the group that we had just wasn‚Äôt going to be able to coexist.‚Äù  And we all saw the Hayward and Kyrie issues."
"Nah, SGA isn't that valuable. He was just filler for the Paul George trade. What you really want is max player Al Horford for a discount of two first round picks"
"It‚Äôs a philosophical thing for Brad:  &gt; ""I spent a lot of time studying this at Butler,‚Äù Stevens said, via WEEI.com. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say out of the 12 years that I‚Äôve been a head coach we‚Äôve rarely had them [captains]. And the reason being is that you want to empower everyone to add leadership within their own authentic way.  &gt; ‚ÄúWe want players like [Al] Horford and [Aron] Baynes, who are the most experienced, to be vocal and active within their personality. We want our best player in Kyrie [Irving] to be vocal and do it within his personality.  &gt; ""[And] we want our other players that aren‚Äôt as accomplished and maybe aren‚Äôt playing as much [like] Robert Williams to feel like it‚Äôs okay to have ownership and say within his personality what he thinks, too."""
They need a lightly used Al Horford
"&gt; The Los Angeles Lakers have acquired guard Dennis Schr√∂der from the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Danny Green and the draft rights to Jaden McDaniels, it was announced by Vice President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Rob Pelinka.  ...  &gt; Philadelphia 76ers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey announced today that the team has acquired Danny Green, Terrance Ferguson and Vincent Poirier (pour-ee-ay) from the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Al Horford, a 2025 protected first-round pick and the draft rights to Th√©o Maledon (No. 34 selection in 2020 NBA Draft) and Vasilije Miciƒá (No. 52 selection in 2014 NBA Draft).   You guys got off Horford's albatross of a contract, but Green looks hella washed now. How are Ferguson and Poirier?"
"&gt; 2007-2012 era of Centers was pretty damn weak. The big brutes that Shaq had faced in his prime were all gone, and the super athletic guys hadn't come into their prime yet. &gt;  &gt; Shaq's opponents during that time, woulda been Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard, ZBo, Ilgauskus, Mehmet Okur, Rasheed Wallace, Duncan, Chris Anderson, Tyson Chandler, Larry Sanders, Al Horford, Kendrick Perkins, Elton Brand, and some other foos I can't remember.  Ilgauskas was big, so was Okur.   Pau wasn't a C, it was Tsakalidis/Wright in MEM and then Bynum/Dwight in LA.   Zbo wasn't a C either, that'd be Joel Przybilla in POR, Eddy Curry in NY, Marcus Camby in LA, and Marc Gasol in MEM.   Elton Brand didn't play C either, Chris Kaman did.   Larry Sanders was only relevant for 1 season, and even then he played less than 2000 minutes that year.   Chris Andersen was a backup, Nene was the starter.   I dunno why you're listing a bunch of PFs and backups, but whatever.   If PHX wanted to run P&amp;R all day, they already had Amare, one of the best P&amp;R bigs ever. Why would they want ""skinny Shaq"" as the roll big when Amare was already elite at it?   &gt; But imagine a slimmed down Shaq running Pick and Rolls with Dwade instead of Joel Anthony. That duo might be able to run through Boston in 08.  08 Miami lost 67 games. Even prime Shaq isn't taking a 67-loss team to the Finals, let alone a 35yo Shaq, no matter what he weighs. Neither could prime Jordan or prime Lebron or prime Jesus."
I agree Bazley ain‚Äôt it yet but I think a lot of the teams stats have to do with resting players like George Hill and Al Horford.  If you check the line up data your starters have a .1 Net rating.  That‚Äôs the lineup with the most minutes and it‚Äôs actually positive.  So the bad net rating comes from other lineups not doing well.  In fact offensively speak that lineup has a 111.8 offensive rating.  It does really well and it has by far the most sample size of any lineup on your team so it‚Äôs not like their isn‚Äôt validity to it.
"Kobe's idea for Shaq's in-shapeness probably would be physically impossible.   Imagine being Shaq's size, working out and running all summer and dropping let's say 30 pounds and getting his BF down considerably.   Now you're playing 40 minutes a night, plus practices. But ideally by the time you're in the playoffs you actually want to be maybe 20 pounds heavier.   It's way easier to start off the season with some extra, play your way into shape, and then by the time you're in the playoffs you're feeling the best you've felt all year long.   The only issue really happened when he was past his prime. After the 2007 season when he couldn't play as many minutes, he couldn't play as many games, he wasn't as effective, he was noticeably slow and easier to take advantage of.   Tim Duncan began to drop a lot of weight as he got older. This allowed him to stay on the floor, play in a faster paced offense, and rely less on posting up and backing down.   If Shaq had gotten skinnier (instead of fatter) instead of becoming a journeyman he probably could have become the league's best Pick and Roll partner, and actually been a much better defender as 2007-2012 era of Centers was pretty damn weak. The big brutes that Shaq had faced in his prime were all gone, and the super athletic guys hadn't come into their prime yet.   Shaq's opponents during that time, woulda been Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard, ZBo, Ilgauskus, Mehmet Okur, Rasheed Wallace, Duncan, Chris Anderson, Tyson Chandler, Larry Sanders, Al Horford, Kendrick Perkins, Elton Brand, and some other foos I can't remember.   But imagine a slimmed down Shaq running Pick and Rolls with Dwade instead of Joel Anthony. That duo might be able to run through Boston in 08."

"Wait, when did Al Horford end up in Oklahoma City?"
"Wiggins and Harris have both shown marked improvement, so neither of them are the biggest albatrosses of the NBA.  That honor might go to Russell Westbrook or Al Horford."
Al Horford
I just want to say that Al Horford is a gorgeous looking man.
"Yea, a Eastern Conference contending team left after that season: Rozier, Marcus Morris, Baynes, Kyrie Irving and Al Horford.  Even with those departures the Jays/Kemba/Hayward/Theis and Smart helped bring the team to a Eastern Conference Final in '19-'20."
"Lol BI top 5 potential? GTFO, he doesn‚Äôt even have top 5 F/G potential lmfao. Dude is a great player and the best of those Lakers, but even then he tops out at a second option at best. Plenty of other teams had/have better rosters than that and don‚Äôt lure FAs. It‚Äôs not hard to get rotational pieces from the draft, that‚Äôs how 85% of the league gets their players. The hard part is getting stars/superstars, which the lakers don‚Äôt have a problem with bc players just ask to join lol. Christ look what happened to the 2019-20 Sixers, they couldn‚Äôt lure anyone but Al Horford and they were one bounce from going to the ECF"
We already had a big al and I loved him but I don‚Äôt won‚Äôt Horford I‚Äôd take a prime al Jefferson tho
"He absolutely can get to Ewing level with improvement to his ball handling.  Most likely is the center version of Al Horford, all round all star center.  If the Suns can keep him as their third best player, they are going to be very good for a long time."
"Yeah bro. Rebuilding is tough to watch, we have to watch broken Griffin move like a turtle every game, and you guys have to watch Al fuckin Horford lol. Hope we both get back on track soon :)"
What does Al Horford have to do with this?
Man Al Horford really shooting    And from the field
"I'm neutral towards Jazz and like Gobert. Good on him for getting paid, the real thief is Al Horford getting a max over Butler @ Sixers."
You can now get a slightly used Al Horford for a low value of ~~one~~ two first round picks
"Give Billy Donovan some time with Wendell. I agree, he would be dope on the Hawks but I actually love his current pairing. Wendell is his Al Horford. He's always reminded me of him as a prospect and then to team up with his college coach is a W."
"I've watched more Hawks games this season than before (practically none, except for when guys like Al Horford, Josh Smith were on the team), and so far he's looked very inconsistent. Maybe he's not being utilized very well, or he's just streaky.  If he's streaky, that's not going to help the Bucks come playoffs."
let's get Al Horford for him.
"2019-20 Hayward was essentially 2016-17 Horford.   Played really really well, but most people don't watch our games so they didn't get to see it.   The difference is that Horford got his moment in the playoffs and the 'Average Al' hot takes died down, Hayward missed the playoffs so never really got to show off how well he'd been playing."

"Embiid's statlines when he has monster games look like those of elite big men that came before him, its not really anything the league hasn't seen before.  Jokic's sometimes just has monster games that see him basically become 7ft Magic Johnson and put up insane assist numbers (with the flashiness to match). That is rare for a big man, and understandably people get more hyped with it  I do agree sometimes Embiid doesn't get the recognition he deserves such as the very strong series he played vs Boston in the bubble, but at times when the spotlight has been on him he hasn't delivered (2018 vs Al Horford &amp; 2019 vs Raptors)"
"PF-Centers that come to mind, whether starting at one and transitioning to the other at different stages of career/roster/or even mid-game: Channing Frye, Al Horford, Kevin Love, Paul Millsap, Domantas Sabonis,  LaMarcus Aldridge, even Giannis plays a fair bit at 4/5...Porzingis as well has that flexibility.   Are PFs really getting smaller/faster/more skilled more so than any other position, or is that just happening more pronouncedly at the 4/5, where there was the most room for improvement? It'd probably be fairer to say there has just been an overall blurring of the lines between roles rather than focusing on just the meta changes at the PF"
Y‚Äôall want Al Horford?
In other news Al Horford has been awful ‚òπÔ∏è
"Everyone thought the stretch five that is going to be traded would be Al Horford...  When in reality, it is Mike ‚ÄúHeat Check‚Äù Muscala"
It is amazing what subtracting a washed up Al Horford and adding shooters will do.
There's two players in the league that can and they're both west. Marc Gasol and Al Horford
"Off hand : Tobias Harris, Kevin Love, Al Horford, Gary Harris, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell,"
"Gotta say Al Horford and Wiggins over KP. If you‚Äôre even putting KP, I‚Äôd also argue Klay with back to back severe injuries but I‚Äôll think he‚Äôll be fine."
What if KD didn‚Äôt leave on July 4th and the Thunder had signed Al Horford that FA (which was planned). Also if we would‚Äôve won that chip lol
"The only ‚Äústars‚Äù Boston signed were Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, and Kemba Walker. Philly signed Horford over Boston, Charlotte signed Hayward over Boston and Indiana. Kemba Walker came from Charlotte."
Can you just say their names? Especially if you are gonna right Al in there and actually mean Al Horford? My brain hurts
"Al Horford, Blake Griffin and Kevin Love"
"He didn't even mention signing Al Horford to a 109M deal, even though he needs to play at 5 to be effective. And the Tobias Harris trade and signing to a massive deal (which looks better now that we have spacing admittedly)"
Al Horford really secured the üí∞.
"I mean every team goes through turnover over a 2-3 year period. Here's some of the players the Celtics have lost since your championship run: Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Aron Baynes, and several other players that weren't starters but were part of the rotation."
"This is golden god level nostalgia, thank you  EDIT: Where does one go for Al Horford Highlights, vimeo?"
"The weird thing about that lineup is that they don't even take advantage of it. They have  Theis ""spacing the floor"" on the perimeter like a poor man's Al Horford when realistically both he and TT should be in the paint boxing out and working together for rebounds."
I can't imagine ignoring every stat that exists and running with a narrative that Embiid and Simmons can't play together bc they were forced to play with al fucking Horford last year.     Every lineup with Ben and Embiid without Horford has been extremely positive.
"I feel like its the celts, bc a lot of people expected the fit of al horford to be extremely questionable when he was signed, especially alongside embiid and ben.   Meanwhile the celtics just came off the ecf and added hayward and kyrie, everyone thought theyd win the east with no problems whatsoever especially with bron gone"
Hey be more creative  We can also trade for Blake Griffin or Westbrook or Lamarcus Aldridge or Al Horford
Kyrie Irving  Jaylen Brown  Gordon Hayward  Jayson Tatum  Al Horford
They can have Al Horford for a 1st in like 2058
Lebron was amazing that playoff run but the east teams he played weren‚Äôt very good  Rookie Tatum and al horford pushed that cavs team to 7 and same with oladipo and the pacers
"Because it makes for a worse league with bad contracts filling up cap space while the team stays the same or worse.  Mitchell and Gobert aren't bringing a title to Utah. Their salaries will also make sure they can't bring in another great player to help them be true contenders. So now they're a worse version of Stockton-Malone Jazz.  The other problem is owners then holding the players by the balls before new CBAs. Players want to get paid, stupid owners give them fat contracts and then whine about losing money on bad contracts because the team isn't going anywhere because the maxed out player isn't playing as good as the money he's getting.Then we get those lockouts looming every few years over the same shit because owners know they're overpaying players and the players don't wanna give it up.  Stoudemire, Carmelo, Al Horford, Dwight Howard, Paul Milsap, Joe Johnson, Deron Williams, Rashard Lewis, Chris Bosh, Elton Brand, Michael Redd... these are just some of the guys who were in the top10 salary wise in the last 10 years and they were never worth it. And that doesn' t even include guys like Mozgov or Deng who are memes at this point.  I don't mind guys getting paid, the amount of money going around NBA is insane and I'm happy for them but we see the same shit all the time- guy plays good for 3 years, somebody gives him max or near max and their production stays the same while the team is stagnating and they can't bring in another player because the salaries don't match and nobody wants to take him on anyway."
"You can watch the minutes he's played in the 5 in the past it's not any good. You dont play him at the 5 because he's not a 5, the Sixers backup 5 spot has been a problem his entire career outside of 2020 with Al Horford. That combined with Embiid missing time every yr gives Simmons plenty of chances to get minutes at the 5, he doesnt get alot because it doesnt work it's obvious why. He's not physical enough and doesnt have that kind of presence inside."
"Chill bruh, he only watches Al Horford highlights."
&gt;neither of them can really shoot  Al Horford last year from 3: 35.0%  Aron Baynes last year from 3: 35.1%  Such an upgrade!  Aron Baynes also holds the NBA record for most 3s made in a game by a center.
"My team would probably top 2-4 seed. (all these guys in their primes)  IT4(Celtics Isaiah)  Marcus Smart  Bird  KG  Horford.  On offense, you have 2 go-to guys, in IT and Larry Bird. Both are great playmakers and 3-level scorers. Marcus Smart is a solid catch-and-shoot guy, and both KG and big Al can stretch the floor to a degree.  On defense, Marcus Smart would help hide IT, we would have incredible post defense with KG and Al, Marcus is an all-nba defender, and Larry Bird is solid.  Only problem is KG and Marcus might not get along, but Horford can be a leader and glue guy for this team.  I would love watching this team play  EDIT: If I can have a 6th man it's gotta be Eddie House."
Only an Al Horford contract left to pay him.
"True, but I think the circumstances were different. Majority, if not all of the minutes from that game came when he was playing the de facto 5 because of the absence of Al Horford, and he was able to play more inside game besides some spot up 3s. With him being really the only inside presence, I think the system helped his case a lot, but of course he had to execute himself, which he did. Throwing him in against the team that doesn‚Äôt have a pure 4 would be a difficult match up for him, as he doesn‚Äôt really have the quickness guard the likes of Aaron Gordon and feast in the paint like he did with another center on the floor"
Al Horford?
"Started following the Mavs because of Dirk, but what cemented my fandom was seeing Villanueva with them, as he is Dominican. Had I known Al Horford (very non-Dominican sounding name) is Dominican, I would‚Äôve been a fan of whatever team he was on at the time, which I think was the Hawks."
Trade for Al Horford.
"I love defensive highlights man. Draymond, Simmons, Giannis and Kawhi are some of the most fun guys to watch on defense. Also Al Horford before his body started decomposing"
Isnt that AL Horford?
&gt;Horford did even better when he was on the same team as Al  what??
I think zu/lou will for al horford and george hill will be at play.
"Shit is hilarious. As if retaining Al Horford or Kyrie Irving would have been worth it. And Hayward brought the biggest TPE in history, Terry Rozier brought Walker, and Marcus Morris is a bona fide bum who makes 72 million now."
It could even be Al Horford!
"Lol the Celtics asset management the last few years have been awful. Here are some names that the Celtics have lost for nothing:  Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris. If that‚Äôs not bad asset management, then I don‚Äôt know what is."
Al Horford only has another year after this one. His deal really isn't that bad given pretty much all his teams play better whilst he is on the floor (with the exception of the sixers because of their poor fit with embiid)
Yeah we really screwed over Gordon Hayward and Al Horford with those massive contracts they got in free agency ü§°
"You can run your offense through him Al Horford style, he's a very good passer.   But yeah his defense is not good and the 3P% isn't great either."
We will trade you al horford for 5 first round picks.
I thought a Horford/Blake deal could work but Al is playing really well all of a sudden so doubt that.
"Al Horford was probably the Celtics best player in the 16-17 run to the conference finals, 15/7/6/1/1 on 58/52/76 (67% TS).  Matter of fact I think there's a case to be made that Horford was the best player on three conference finals runs, Atlanta 14-15, Boston 16-17 and 17-18."
Al Horford would be a great fit for Boston
I think they need someone like Al Horford if I‚Äôm honest. Hordford and 2 second rounders for JB who says no?

Idk why they never replaced Al Horford. They need a decent big man.
Al Horford is still there
"The fact that OKC are near .500 with SGA and a bunch of 2-4 year players and Al horford means something, they‚Äôve kept it close with LA and Den and beating Milwaukee tonight. This team will be absurdly good in 2 years. How Presti manages to constantly do so well is beyond me, even when they‚Äôre putting on a supposedly bad product on the floor, it‚Äôs still a great product"
I still am a proud owner of an ‚ÄúAl Horford Appreciator Club‚Äù t-shirt
Al Horford fits nicely in that TPE. OKC wants to be in the top 5 in terms of draft picks in 2021. Al is not helping them do that lol
Al Horford has been great lately. I miss him
They should trade for Al Horford. It‚Äôs actually perfect if you think about it.
Al Horford is the answer.   Need solid play from your C?   Al's gonna be solid.  Need someone to step up for a win?  Al's going to be solid.
"Al Horford, he fits into the TPE and all the Thunder will want is a FRP"
celtics fucked up badly. Hayward at 30$ mil is better than kemba rn. I'd rather have rozier + extra cap space than kemba rn. Also rather have al horford at 30$ mill than kemba rn.
George hill and/or al horford would help right? Give me picks.
That's not how you spell Al Horford
"Hey Boston we got this Al Horford guy, looks like a good center I've heard that you need. I think he would look good in a Celtics uniform. George Hill is nice too just gib picks plz."
"I‚Äôm still convinced Wendell Carter is an Al Horford like talent. Super good defender, good shooter, high IQ. Fringe allstar talent.   He needs a new situation."
How about Al Horford back?
This jazz team is more al horford/ millsap Atlanta hawks than 2014 Spurs
"Al, easily.   There's no guarantee KG is on for all the games, and Kwame at his best doesn't come close to Al Horford."
With Al Horford as your best player I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll get very far anyway
I'll take my chances with 3 or 4 games of a top 25 player of all time vs 7 games of Al Horford.
"Honestly the disrespect to Al Horford, you‚Äôre basically asking if he‚Äôs worth half a Kevin Garnett. There are plenty of players worse than Al that I‚Äôd take over half a KG."
Player B. Would you rather have Al Horford for all 7 games in a 7 game series or Kevin Garnett for 3 or 4 games in a 7 game series?
Al Horford. Not trying to see my Allstar turn to Kwame Brown every few games. People forget how good Al has been in his career.
Al Horford
Al Horford.
"this is a good pick too. i went with al horford, but boozer did what he did and went home.   udonis haslem?  good for 8-14 every game off of broken plays...i dont know if they ever ran a play for haslem but he still shows up on the stat sheet."
al horford?
"Al Horford ~~has~~ ‚Äúhad‚Äù Giannis‚Äò number. Cell, home, fax, work, everything."
*Al Horford nods*
"I just checked bball ref's HoF probability list and it's laughable, they have Rose at a 12% chance behind Al Horford and Kemba Walker."
"I had this take back when they made the trade, but:   Al Horford is going to rehab his value so much that OKC flips him for a positive asset by this summer a la CP3. It turns out, the problem was just that Philly's four best players were all either 4s or 5s."
"You don‚Äôt have to give up a single pick to acquire Al Horford, OKC would love off his contract if anybody wanted to take on his contract. (I do think he‚Äôd be a great fit it Toronto though, he‚Äôs still very solid)"
Giving up picks for Al Horford?!?! I think I just threw up in my mouth a little
"-You‚Äôre saying Donovan Mitchell is no better than Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver, or Al Horford? Really?  -That subpar wing defense held Giannis to 2 points and 3 FGA in the first half, and most of his points came in the 4th quarter in garbage time.  But maybe you think Giannis is a subpar wing."
&gt; one idiot straight up pitched trading him for Al Horford 1:1.  That guy deserves a lifetime ban from your sub lol
"Depending on both what you would consider his prime, and what a star is, you could say there were three (not directly related to injury) careers that rose and fell.  - Al Horford - OJ Mayo - LaMarcus Aldridge  For players with injury histories, there are some notable names.  - Brandon Roy - Blake Griffin - Derrick Rose"
Mavs fandom is so entitled sometimes. Porzi≈Üƒ£is comes back from surgery and averages 20 &amp; 8  with 2 BPG on 46/32/85 shooting and he's become the scapegoat in /r/mavericks. As if those numbers are remotely bad. His defense has looked shakey but it's improving.   Folks have mentioned trading him and Brunson for Andre Drummond and one idiot straight up pitched trading him for Al Horford 1:1.
"So he didn't have 2 all-stars with him.   The Warriors and maybe the Rockets bounce the Cavs sure. But it would take a 60 win type top West team. Indiana was good that year they are basically the Jazz West. Oladipo, Myles Turner, Sabonis, Bogdanovic etc good team all around shooting and defense.  Toronto was a 59 win team they had a better record than the Warriors that year they were excellent. They were the favorites to win the series. They had Valunchunis and Ibaka and Fred Vanvleet.  Boston was better without Kyrie. They had a better record without him playing and they were a better defensive team without him. Boston was led by the all-star/all-defense Al Horford. Tatum balled out his age doesn't mean anything. The Cavs were led by a 34 year old Lebron James.  That Boston team wouldn't get swept by anyone. '19 year old Tatum' beat Giannis and Embid before running into Lebron. Boston had the #2 ranked defense in the entire league."
"We traded for Al Horford so yes, we're tanking."
"Poor Lakers, they apparently needed DPOY Davis to comfortably beat Al Horford and Hamidou Diallo :( lmao gtfo yall are delusional"
"It was the same Boston team Lebron beat but with Kemba Walker instead of Terry Rozier, and no Al Horford."
"I‚Äôm an idiot because I though it said Al, like Al Horford. Not A.I. I was so confused..."
"Nothing much better than what he has now. A max deal for him or any rookie is way too risky and unlikely as it is essentially a futures bet. Zero to low precedent for any rookie to get max in 2nd year. If he wants to play for the Sixers 3 years past his prime, we can accommodate under the Al Horford precedent and throw a hundred mil at him. üòÇ"
If Al Horford got a LeBron before LeBron I would lose my shit
who thought leaving Al Horford on the court for that play was a good idea

4 secs and they wanted Al Horford to catch the ball mid-court? Sounds like a good strat
It was his defense but also the fact that Lebron didn‚Äôt drive because Al Horford came in the paint to prevent the drive to the basket as well.
"What's funny is al horford had 25 7 7 at one point, would've been hilarious if he ended the game with a lebron statline against lebron"
If I have to watch Al Horford bring the ball up in crunch time again I might put my fist through the TV screen
"Seriously, you pass it to *Al Horford* running the opposite way 75 feet away from the basket with 4 seconds left and no timeouts? Play was as good as dead even without the steal."
Damn i wish we had this Al Horford guy
"&gt;that's three power forwards i can't go through this again after last year.  Issue with last year was Al Horford wasnt a real floor spacer nobody actually guards him despite what his %s are. Otto Porter is. Even as recently [Otto Porter used to be a rather versatile defender](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/knarsu3/) theyd put him on guys like Goran Dragic. That's another difference with him and Horford, Horford it was pushing it to have him guard 3s and some 4s even. Whether Tobias is a 3 or 4 defensively doesnt really make any difference for him.   Also Otto's gonna play 25ish min a game in this hypothetical you can stagger his minutes I dont its a big issue the fit.   That said this is all just a hypothetical he makes too much it's not gonna happen so wouldnt really worry about it."
George Hill and Al Horford
"I guess I just fundamentally disagree. It's a fan event showing off the brightest stars in the NBA. Team success should have nothing to do with it. It's commendable that players come together and make it work and have a ton of success in terms of wins, but that's not the spirit of the event. Let me give you an example, in 2014-2015 the Hawks had four allstars. They had Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague, and Kyle Korver. They had a really good record and clearly they deserved multiple AllStars, but Kyle Korver had no business being an AllStar. That guy is the ultimate role player. Really really good at what he does, but not an AllStar. That's what I'm talking about. So the Jazz would really deserve to have Mitchell and Gobert. Conley is playing well, but his numbers are in no way deserving of an Allstar nod. So who else would they get?"
What kind of draft compensation would the Celtics give OKC to trade Kemba for Al Horford + George Hill?
"Trae's a huge defensive liability and is lazy off-ball movement. He only adds value with the ball in his hands.   Swapping him with Simmons is not a net positive even if your other player is Embiid IMO.  Conley's more intriguing: elite shooter, good passer, good defender.  They might get past Toronto and Milwaukee if they had Conley/Reddick, not sure.  The problem is their system sucked.  They already had a perimeter spacing talent with distance in 2018 named Tobias Harris.   The problem is they were still using Simmons as point forward and relegating Harris to spot-up shooter and went out and spent their cap on Al Horford instead of getting more shooting.  Simmons and Embiid haven't changed their games this year: they can co-exist once the GM and coach understand how to make it so."
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
Is horford really an embiid stopper? Idk if this version of al is
3 team trade where OKC gets Spencer Dinwiddie Landry Shamet and matching salary BKN gets al horford and the 3rd team is for salary filler to get OKC enough $$
"Trezz thought he was AD tonight lol.  Between the coast to coast, bully ball on al horford, and key defensive plays, he was like our Walmart AD tonight"
Al horford keeps throwing up air balls on switches vs Dennis schroder he‚Äôs gonna tank his value to where BKN can get him for DeAndre and Dinwiddies expiring
Al Horford is the new NBA tank commander
Al Horford is super tanking.
I still think he was a star but I know he wasn't a #1 guy. Al Horford was their best player that season but Paul Millsap was the team's best the next season.
"I disagree. Those Hawks teams were notable because they were successful without having a star and Al Horford was generally considered to be their best player. The year they won 60 games was a fluke and they got swept in the conference finals.  Regardless, the comp to KG still doesn't seem right, even if you think Millsap was more than a very good role player."
It's weird how people keep knocking Danny for doing nothing when every big move he's made seems to blow up in unexpected ways (baring Al Horford signing).
"Al Horford is a piece that will put a good team into contender territory.   I would say Utah, Portland, or the Celtics."
Lmao what do you mean win a game and drop confetti. Think you win a game and drop confetti before losing in overtime to an Al Horford gamewinner is the way to go
"He signed Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, and Kemba Walker in 3 of 4 offseasons  He hasn't really made big trades but he's definitely retooled the team plenty. It just a) hasn't worked and b) is around the margins"
"""Or"" isn't enough.    Over the past 5 years, Danny brought in:  Isaiah Thomas + Al Horford + Gordon Hayward + Kyrie Irving + Kemba Walker + Jayson Tatum + (soon to be All-Star) Jaylen Brown.   If ""or"" was enough then people would already be satisfied. Danny fell short because he didn't bring in all those guys ""and"" more.  You have to get every single All-Star in the NBA or you are a failure."
Scrubs  \-Al horford
It‚Äôs hard to say tbh the comp for KG to me from a physical perspective is al horford and horford was always able to hold up surprisingly well vs Embiid they could put him 1 v 1. Both were in that 240 lb range old man strength is a hell of a thing also    It‚Äôs weird though I can see what your saying he doesn‚Äôt have Bam‚Äôs physical strength and tbh bam can‚Äôt guard Joel Embiid they played tons of zone last year vs Philly and different things to minimize the time Bam directly spent 1 v 1 vs Embiid. Which is part of why I think it‚Äôs hard to say
"1. Al Horford was supposed to be the ‚ÄúGiannis Stopper‚Äù after the 2018 playoffs, where Khris was the main factor then.  2. Why the hell do you keep bringing up Middleton lol? 20 ppg helped but I‚Äôd much rather try containing 30 ppg"
If Nets get Al Horford ima be shook
"&gt;I think **short term** Al Horford does more for GSW than Draymond. But Al Horford is on the decline.  First read what I write, second certainly adding spacing and defence at the 5 would improve you this year. It's not the best bet longterm ofc since Draymond is younger and Horford is declining rapidly but your team would be a lot more balanced with Horford in the starting lineup and your offence much more potent."
Bro al horford over Draymond?? What color are the padded walls where you live?
I think short term Al Horford does more for GSW than Draymond. But Al Horford is on the decline.
I think the semi realistic dream is scour the market for a 3rd team to see if you can come up with a viable partner to make a Spencer dinwiddie Landry Shamet Nic Claxton for Al Horford framework work. You need more matching $$ which is why I said 3rd team but if you can find it that‚Äôs the one I think is a difference maker. I don‚Äôt see OKC doing this if you make them take back DeAndre since Horford is only partially guaranteed his last year
With Harris he‚Äôs 29 but he‚Äôs also the type of player who‚Äôll age well. JJ Redick was able to bring it at about the same level until he was 34-35. Harris has more size so he might be able to age better defensively he may very well have like 5 years left of being roughly this player. I don‚Äôt think Cleveland would do it Nance is pretty valuable but if I were to get an extra first yeah I would   I think the real dream for BK which might be somewhat viable is scour the market for a 3rd team to make salaries match where you can give OKC Dinwiddie‚Äôs expiring Landry Shamet and whatever else to match from another team for al horford. That‚Äôs the one if you can drop al horford on this roster even at age 35 I would be really in on even if his contract sucks
"Al Horford, Aleksej Pokusevski, 3-4 1sts and a 2nd"
"Right now ? Cause of championship contention. It's clear players want to be put in the best position to win in this buyout market / pre trade deadline.      Boston doesn't look good enough.      I think when contracts are coming to a close Boston will always have a free agent looking. They got Kyrie, Hayward, and Al Horford ""recently."" Before that they got KG and Ray Allen for a championship in 07-08."
"That's not what I said. I was and an pro-Hinkie, but I can't imagine sitting Horford is causing much anger around the league. The Process Sixers could've accepted a contract like that in a good-enough salary dump and either cut him, bought him out, flipped him for other contracts, or played him. I doubt they would've played him much, but I don't really see how this is anything but a false equivalency.   The Sixers weren't signing veterans at all, and they were forcing players that would sign with them into the worst contracts they could, shit like RoCo, Hollis Thompson, Brandon Davies, KJ McDaniels. How many veterans did they  sign to anything other than a minimum deal? Of those, how many had any significant guaranteed money? They didn't originate it but they weaponized the non-guaranteed 4-year deal like no other team. They were aggressively cute with trigger dates. It let them have lots of trade chips and save money. The NBAPA and agents hated it. Agents would refuse to let their players work out for the Sixers. Shit like that can cause labor strife and absolutely threaten work continuity at the next CBA negotiation. They were seen as making the player-friendly NBA contract model more like the ruthless NFLs. Their gaming of the salary floor was incredible. And legal. And absolutely hated in a way where paying Al Horford $27mm to work out and not get minutes doesn't remotely rate. There were years like 2014 where they may not have actually paid $27mm to players who actually saw the court, where they paid a partial year fraction of the cap hit mostly to salary dump players. There's no argument that the Sixers were putting out a better product than the Thunder are, but that's completely besides the point. Sixers fans were engaged and understood what they were doing but god-damn your analysis is either shallow or some bad-faith agenda-pushing bullshit to act like Horford is the same thing."
"Well ya, especially if the player wants to play. Al Horford isn't a positive trade asset, and hasn't said he has a problem with being benched. So the situation's a little bit different."
What makes it worst is they didn‚Äôt resign Jimmy butler or J.J Reddick for Tobias Harris and Al horford.
"The difference is Al Horford alone will not win us games. And based on last night where Moses turned into Wilt for half a game, it could be argued this wasn't even a tanking move but just a player development move."
"The only thing that matters to the league is the bottom line. They don't really care that NO tanked, they care that they're benching AD, a guy who will attract tons of fans. There's maybe 5 people in the world that will watch an NBA game solely because Al Horford is in it, and Adam Silver doesn't give a fuck about those 5 people."
"Boston gets big names in from other teams like KG, Ray Allen, Gordan Hayward, Kemba Walker, Al Horford. Id say thier history puts them in the group of desired locations.  I think the city has a big impact for sure but it is also how the organization is run, team success, culture, history of how stsrs are treated, ability to build a roster around a star, consistent competitiveness, and those types of things that bring the guys in.   Teams that try tactics like losing on purpose, sitting star players, underpaying, being cheap with salary cap, and the likes are remembered by players as places were you wont be able to get a ring. And the high level players all want accolades and proof they are great."
"Kyle Korver who was the best shooter in the league (before MVP Curry happened) and DeMarre Carroll both went down with injuries. Al Horford still played but got injured too, and that was the year a cop broke Sefolosha's leg and took him off the roster for the rest of the season."
The fact that there is a gm out there that gave AL fucking horford max money is astounding to me
"&gt;I love how your two examples of superstars signing were 40 years ago  How many other teams can match signing two prime All-time greats at any time?  Never mind signing them to play together and win a ring.  &gt;extreme overpay of Al Horford and JJ Reddick basically in the final years of his career   All sought-after free agents get overpaid, that's simple economics.  Don't want to overpay free agents?  Don't blow draft picks and trades so often."
I love how your two examples of superstars signing were 40 years ago and the most recent was an extreme overpay of Al Horford and JJ Reddick basically in the final years of his career
"&gt;Exactly that. Market. Does. Not. Matter. You're either LA/NY/Miami or you're not. Mainly LA/NY.  The Lakers have signed two major free agents in their history.  Admittedly two very good ones in Shaquille O'Neal and LeBron James, but that's a total of 10.5 player-seasons, of which they've spent about a quarter injured.  O'Neal wasn't good enough to win in Orlando, and James was 34 -- and most people thought he was semi-retiring to Hollywood.  Both of those deals turned out better than they looked at signing, and that's partially due to the Lakers being generally-excellent at roster construction.  Their 3rd-best free agent signing is Kurt Rambis, so it falls off quite steeply.  &gt;There are a ton of large markets in the NBA but only the ones in these cities get free agents to go there time and time again.  First off, Philadelphia acquired Julius Erving in his prime essentially as a free agent -- they paid cash for him.  Second, Philadelphia acquired Moses Malone after agreeing to a free-agent deal with him in '82.  That turned into a sign-and-trade after Houston sued, but it wasn't because Philadelphia wasn't attractive to him.  No one has picked up two better players on the open market.  And did not Al Horford and JJ Redick recently sign with Philadelphia when they were still sought-after?    That said, would you sign with a Philadelphia team if you had a choice?  I was watching the 1980 Finals the other day, and every time the Lakers scored a few baskets in a row, the Philadelphia crowd booed their team.  In the Finals.  Same thing happened in '82, as well.  Significant free agents have signed with non-LA/NY teams more often than not.  Durant signed with Golden State ( and Brooklyn ).  Steve Nash to Phoenix.  Aldridge signed with San Antonio ( and Brooklyn ).  Ariza to Houston.  West to Indiana.   Horford to Boston.  Pau Gasol to Chicago.  Billups to Detroit.  And many others.  And by the way, 13% of the teams are in LA/NY, so they should get about 1 in every 7 free agents by simple chance."
"Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving &amp; Lebron James was a super team in 2015.  The reason the Warriors got to the Finals that year was because the talent level was low in the league. Like I said, transitional period, the old guard in Duncan, Kobe etc were moving on and the young guys weren‚Äôt established in the league yet.  Besides Warriors and Cavs. You had Lob City Clips, Al Horford Hawks, Lowry Derozan Raptors, Harden Dwight Rockets, Dame LMA Blazers, KD &amp; Russ who were hurt a lot.  That‚Äôs how bad the talent was. Most teams had 1-2 All Stars at most. Lebron-Kyrie-Love is 100% a super team in comparison to the rest"
Ok guys i will tell presti to just let al horford stand on the court. It will be 4 against 5 the whole time
"Noone would turn on their tv and say lets watch Al Horford playing today, that's why"
It's al horford and a small market team. That's not worth bringing the hammer down over as long as both sides are happy with the deal. Which it seems they are
Because the thunder are a young developing team. I mean the reason the sixers got rid of him was because 36 year old al horford would outshine embidd with his vigor and his team friendly contract
&gt;	You‚Äôre right though that nobody is awake in bed right now overcome with grief that Al Horford is shut down for the season.  OP is
"Seems like a pretty narrow set of circumstances where they could swing a trade. That's a lot of salary to match so unless some team just has $25m in total wastes of space rostered and is willing to throw in a sweetener to make it worth OKC's while and get a 35yo Al Horford who hasn't played in a year, I don't see things panning out for them."
Al horford who was deemed one of the worst contracts last year is not being played compared to ad a top ten player I let you guess why
Cuz Al Horford is 34 years old lol. what the fuck
"Let‚Äôs put it this way, OKC games are still exciting and Al Horford isn‚Äôt selling anybody tickets. It‚Äôs politics unfortunately"
Al Horford is legitimately not good enough to get minutes. He mailed it in once he got his retirement contract.
The league cares about viewers. They cared when the sixers tanked because people care about the sixers. They fined the spurs for DNP resting players because it was a national game. They threatened the pelicans for resting AD because people watch AD. Nobody cares about the Thunder and they definitely dont care about watching al Horford
Dudley is hurt tho lol. Not the same. Al Horford was also averaging 30 minutes a game compared to 7 minutes for Dudley. So no not the same at all.
"Ehh, there‚Äôs a legitimate argument in there somewhere that rules like this are enforced selectively depending on a player and team‚Äôs marketability. You‚Äôre right though that nobody is awake in bed right now overcome with grief that Al Horford is shut down for the season."
"Because no one cares about Al Horford or the Thunder, why is this hard to understand?"
Because it's a nearly 35 year old Al Horford. Apples and oranges
Yeah of course. No one cares about watching Al Horford on the Thunder.
"I‚Äôm going to be honest, if you‚Äôre upset that Al Horford is sitting the rest of the season, you probably just want to be mad at something."
OKC: Al Horford is trash so we benched him. Problem solved
Al Horford still a punk bitch for what he did to TJ Ford
"&gt;Morey's best move, the fact we got an actual player for Horford is a stroke of genius  Daryl Morey (Sixers President of Basketball Operations) trading Al Horford to Oklahoma City, along with a 2025 top 6 protected first round pick, and a 2020 second round pick (Theo Maledon), for Danny Green, is the best move he's made in his current job. Philadelphia not only got rid of Al Horford, who has a large contract and didn't fit well with the team, they got a player in return who is valuable to the team, whilst they didn't have to part ways with an excess of future assets. Morey did very well in making this trade.  I expanded it a little, does this help? Let me know if you don't understand anything"
Horford  just came back from an injury as well.  Al didn‚Äôt seem to mind the decision that was made
"Nah, Curry = Harris, Collins = LMA, Capela = Drummond. Replace those names with whoever you feel is equivalent instead. Al Horford. Whatever. That is the Nets.   Regardless, it blows LA out of the water. It's not even comparable you crybabies, it's KD-GSW status"
Look at Moses Brown‚Äôs box score for the Thunder tonight. No need for Al Horford
Presti calling all 29 NBA teams that Al Horford is available and the starting bid is 3 FRPs and a couple of swaps.
"I‚Äôve been locked in a Dominican jail for four years, is Al Horford really leading a bunch of no names to a respectable record? Seems like they should be terrible besides Big Bad Al"
This man single handedly sent Al Horford on vacation
"It isn't even because it interferes with the tank that much, Al Horford isn't Anthony Davis. They'd just rather develop their young players."
Watching Al Horford play has never been exceptionally entertaining
Report: Al Horford caught stowing away in Celtics' team plane wheel well.
Al Horford
"Nobody is buying tickets to watch Al Horford, even if people were still buying tickets."
"Our entire line-up tonight takes up less cap space than Jrue Holiday.  You could have this entire line-up and a cool 4 million left over, OR one Al Horford."
Nobody watching NBA games for Al Horford.   The entertainment will be fine.
"i reckon high pick rookies would gain a lot by playing next to vet al horford for 10 minutes a night. he doesn't have to be starting or anything, but if that dude's coming onto the floor and giving advice, they'll benefit"
oh yeah the thunder traded for al horford not the 1st rounder. hes also really impeding their chance to be a title team because of his salary  so many idiotic takes
"Me: Kids, high work ethic is important as u have to work hard to earn ur keep!   Kids: Why does Al Horford get paid a lot to rest?   ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"I‚Äôm sorry but if you need Al Horford for your product to be entertaining, when Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is right there, then there‚Äôs something wrong with your product."
Can you swing a trade of Al Horford for Dinwiddie?
Wow now soon as you made this okc said al horford sitting the rest of season
Al Horford - future Net
"oh no totally, the Celtics have been wrecked by covid, and are definitely better than their record.   I just had to watch big ass Al Horford jab steps for 82 games last year so I‚Äôm going to make fun of Pete Buttigieg‚Äôs Chowdah Squad whenever I see the slightest sign of struggle"
It's the same both ways. I had to survive a year of Al Horford jokes last season ;(
"This isn't our old sixers teams. We still have room to improve, but we're a lot better now that we don't have to deal with Al Horford, Jimmy, etc. Could use one more ball handler/stretch big, but we're a much more sensible build now."
"Yeah this isn‚Äôt the east bro, 19 year old Jayson Tatum and all star al Horford aren‚Äôt your biggest threats. An injured Miami Heat took you to 6"
"Al Horford would be good for you, but that contract lol.."
"You‚Äôre right  A lot of people written the Celtics off that playoff season since Kyrie and Hayward weren‚Äôt gonna play  I remember reading how some of the lower seeded teams kinda tanked to match up with Celtics in the playoffs (though I could be wrong on that)  Nobody here really expected a team with Al Horford and a rookie Tatum to beat the sixers, especially how great they looked after that Heat series  It was definitely an upset in my books"
"Teams like Houston, OKC would trade their bad contracts in a heartbeat. It's the Spurs who wouldn't want to take John Wall or Al Horford contracts."
"Serge Ibaka, JJ Redick, George Hill, and Al Horford over KPJ and Devin Booker?"
I don‚Äôt really understand the hype around Al Horford
"&gt;Bigs shoot differently to wings. They're a little more cautious, they're often slower to get their shots off and they prefer different types of shots. Decent shooting for a C in a PnP situation doesn't translate to decent shooting out on the wings.  Yeah all of this. Al Horford for a 5 is better than most 5s at floor spacing. Which is a very low bar to clear but it's true because he'll take 3s basically. Al Horford for a 4 is not better than most 4s at floor spacing. Not at all it's the opposite. Not in today's NBA where the 4's are all these Bojan Bogdanovic types.   Everything is relative to position and the types of 3s you shoot. You can count on one hand the number of 5s that are true floor spacers with real gravity. %s arent what dictate that. And unless your a Porzingis/KAT type, there are just more valuable things to be doing offensively if your a 5 than standing on the perimeter taking 4 3s a night.   Turner is great at what he does defensively. That makes him worth $18 mil. But he's really no different than these other defensive oriented centers who's value is just on one end of the court. That's why nobody wants to give up meaningful assets for him."
OKC is 7th and we are playing a bunch of 20 to 23 year olds and Al Horford lol.
"Buddy, in 2018 you had the two best players (at the time with Simmons and Embiid) and you lost to a rookie Tatum and Al Horford in 5 lmao. We were definitely the underdog there"
The classic Al Horford
"Yeah the Celtics were really fucked when he lead them to 41-16 that first year before he got hurt, playing with inconsistent rookies and al Horford with Hayward injured"
"Can I be the devil's advocate for another point of view? As far as bone-headed moves by young point guards go, that was rough but not all that bad. he missed his guy and was more forcused on running down the clock. in the other example ppl always use, love had great position on tobias harris, but al horford was lurking, waiting to steal the ball. they're not that egregious imo.  on the other hand, the way love handled both situations sucked ass. he's getting paid handsomely to be a vet to these young guys. it's bad enough that he's hurt all the time, so to me it sucks when he handles this shit in such an unproductive way. whatever issues you have with sexton, he's a good fucking player and a huge part of the cavs' future. your job is to nurture him. period."
"Or a longer-term contract for a guy who isn't living up to it.  Obviously, there hasn't been a lot of time to grow disgruntled with the moves made in November, but things like OKC's acquisition of Al Horford plus assets for Danny Green and filler.  Now, obviously *some part of that* was compensation for Green, and some part was compensation for taking Horford.  I don't think we'd get a high 2nd and a future first in a LMA-for-bad-money swap. But perhaps one or the other might be in the cards."
Bobby Portis and Enes Kanter have long given the Sixers problems.  Marc Gasol and Al Horford were effective at stopping embiid in their younger days but they're probably a bit long in the tooth for that duty now.
Holy fuck celitcs fans are deliusonal you beat the start of the ben and joel duo. Then beat us with AL horford and no Ben. The celtics will barely make the playoffs and yall think your going to beat us lmao. üò≠
"Yikes, it's definitely not like we had Brett Brown who consistently got out coached in every series and Al Horford who was nearly unplayable, as well as no Ben Simmons"
"He also seems like a great vet to have the young bloods grow with. Even though his assist numbers aren't crazy high, he is definitely a playmaker when he gets the ball in the post. Kind of reminds me of Al Horford in that respect. He probably has a ton of hockey assists, he just needs better/healthier talent to pass the ball to"
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
"It's two things.  One, it's a volume issue - just not a lot of players in the NBA, and even less players that matter.  You don't even see a star retire every year, yet every year they're choosing Hall of Fame classes.  And there's no backlog.  So as somebody even moderately worthy comes in they have a great shot.  Meanwhile in sports like MLB and NFL, you see multiple Hall worthy players retire annually, and there's a giant back log of guys.  The second thing is the basketball Hall is not NBA-specific.  So basically everything counts - college, international, etc.  It means moderate NBA careers can get in with excellent college careers.  (why I think Al Horford is getting in)"
"I don‚Äôt believe that. A year ago, everyone would have agreed that Al Horford was on an ‚Äúuntradeable‚Äù contract but he still got traded. People would have said the same things 2 years ago about Chris Paul"
"&gt; All you need is shooting around him and a decent point guard  Nope, pairing him with Al Horford is the answer"
"Those were really top heavy classes that didn‚Äôt pan out with most of the talent coming from late 1st and 2nd round picks.  ‚Äò04: Dwight Howard, Iguodala, Deng, Al Jefferson were the three stand outs (all 15th or higher)  ‚Äò05: Bogut (#1), Chris Paul (#4), and Gortat (#57) were the ones in this draft.  ‚Äò06: LaMarcus Aldridge (#2), Rudy Gay (#8), Reddick (#11), Rondo (#21), Lowery (#24), and Millsap (#47) slightly deeper but just as many bangers #20 on as there are in the top 20.  ‚Äò07: Durant (#2 ‚Äî sorry Portland), Al Horford (#3), Mike Conley (#4), Noah (#9), Thad Young (#12), Glen Davis (#35), and of course Marc Gasol (#48).  Edit: autocorrect"
Does anyone think Al horford sitting out every back to back is actually hurting his trade value?

"He is like Al Horford. Good at defense (eventually got 1 year second team all defensive team) good rebounding and good scorer usually in the teens. However allergic to contact and never gets to the free throw line. Al Horford though doesn't have the height/length and athleticism as Ayton, it makes no sense why Ayton plays like that."
Wow didn‚Äôt expect this on a Al Horford thread
"If he can develop his handles, I can see him being as good as Al Horford.   That's a solid number 1 pick."
Al Horford could be Mr. Universe... Dude looks great.
Probably Al Horford the 5-time all-star?
"It this story time?  When I was a bagboy at Publix, Al Horford came in on his birthday to collect a Western Union he‚Äôd been sent from the Dominican Republic, where he‚Äôs from. He took some pictures when us and was overall very nice, soft spoken.   Also, he‚Äôs fucking gigantic. Dude had to duck under the cash checking sign at the front counter."
"Type in 'Al Horford' in google and the first suggestion is ""Al Horford wife'.  Clyde wasn't exaggerating. She was nominated Miss Universe in 2003."
"I'm a girl, Al Horford is ugly, I don't get why ppl think he's pretty?"
"No.   It's entertainment. The tone they're intentionally going for is conversational, relaxed, as if you're watching it with friends. Clyde is the ""color commentator"", literally there to bring humor and levity. He's not commenting on Al Horford Sales Projections for the 3rd quarter."
Al horford &gt; Kelly oubre for prettiest nba player
"He also did it playing against an entire team of 1st and 2nd year players minus Al Horford and Kenrich Williams.. he's doing great but lets pump the brakes here a bit...   Outside of those two the oldest guy on that team has played a total of 34 NBA games, basically college players"
Another Al Horford highlight
What's crazy is Al Horford is probably prettier than his wife.
PG: Ben Simmons SG: Mattese Thybold SF: Tobias Harris PF: Al Horford C: Joel Embiid  Nah that‚Äôs fine /s
"&gt;	Everyone says this every year and then a bad contract gets traded. &gt; &gt;	Al Horford got traded.   Yeah you needed to give up a first to dump horford. Horfords contract was way better than tobias‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt say it was untradeable, just that Philly is gonna have to chalk up two firsts just to get rid of him."
"&gt;No one is gonna trade for Tobias and his awful contract lmfao.   Everyone says this every year and then a bad contract gets traded.  Al Horford got traded. Andrew Wiggins got traded. John Wall got traded. Gordon Hayward ""wouldn't opt out"" and then gets a 30/4 contract.   Philly has all their assets. If you dont think there's a tanking team out there who would take a few years of an overpaid wing in exchange for assets attached, then you don't have a good awareness of the league."
It‚Äôs actually insane how bad that roster was. Brand took a 50 win team with balanced shooting around Joel and Ben and completely ruined the spacing. If they had just kept JJ instead of signing Al Horford they would‚Äôve been probably 5 wins better.
"It's wild how utterly delusional this take is.  * FRP for Rondo * Made two insanely huge trades to land both KG and Ray * Perkins for Green * Doc Rivers for a FRP * KG + Pierce for 5 FRPs (two of which became Tatum and Brown) * My personal favorite trade NOTHING for Marcus Thorton, Tyler Zeller, FRP * Zeller + FRP for IT + Jerebko * Rondo for Crowder, filler, FRP * Green for MEM FRP * 1st overall (Fultz) for Tatum + FRP (which turned into 2 FRPs through more moves) * Crowder, Zizic, IT &amp; BRK FRP for Kyrie * Signed Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, and Kemba Walker to max free agent deals.  Lost in the ECF 3 of the last 4 years. Missed the playoffs once since 2008, and only 3 times in his 18 year career with Boston.   By all means, do point out managers with that sustained level of success that arent Pat Riley."
Getting to watch this team ALMOST makes the Al Horford experience worth it
Al Horford and Joel Embiid a close second
pulling the patented ole al horford flinch
"Send kemba and some picks for Al Horford, I'm dead serious lol"
you mean like al horford
"Brook Lopez. Joakin Noah, Pau Gasol in the Bulls? Al Horford?"
"at least you admit it. reddit was shitting on chris paul big time.  the overreaction to ""bad"" contracts whether it is westbrook, paul, or wiggins, or jamal murray or simmons or siakam or al horford or (or even blake griffin) or whoever, is totally ridiculous. they are always way easier to shed then people claim and half the time the player in question is not nearly as ""washed"" as everyone claims. plus, everyone acts like ""cap space"" is this magical thing without understaning how rare it is for genuine difference makers to ever hit the market and how much, generally, you have to overpay for them when they do."
"Deck*  also I think Al Horford is from the Dominican Republic, and the knicks recently signed Luca Vildoza"
"Because most defenses are not focused on MPJ, they are focused on the mvp he is playing next to, as well as the elite scoring guard he played with most of the season. Shai on the other hand, is putting up great numbers on elite efficiency with his second best player being a fairly washed Al Horford, or Lu Dort who despite all his improvements still isn‚Äôt a very good offensive player. Besides, the Thunder were 20-27 before Shai went down, which isn‚Äôt good but certainly isn‚Äôt terrible."
"Here's from some fellow 76'er fans:    &gt;Still waiting on the fine for not playing Horford for 2/3rds of the year, i'm sure there are more Colangelo's that can fill in as GM    and    &gt;I better see Bryan Colangelo hired by the Thunder tomorrow.    and    &gt;Anytime I hear anything about the Thunder and all their draft picks and how well Presti is doing as GM there I just get angry.     and    &gt;It's just hard to not be a little bit salty that he's spitting in the face of the NBA rules harder than the Sixers and getting no punishment for it    and    &gt;Come on bro. I believe tanking should be a legal strategy but OKC needs to be punished the same way the Sixers were. Look at the garbage lineups you guys are throwing out there meanwhile Al horford and SGA are nowhere to be found. If we got punished by the league for what we did then you guys should too.    and    &gt;The process sixers never did this and they got absolutely butt fucked by Silver and the Colangelos. They arent even trying to hide they are tanking which is why im told this happened to philly being too transparent and not dressing it up    and    &gt;Thunder are taking advantage of the current league roles. Sixers took advantage of prior league rules. Both made smart decisions, but only we‚Äôve been made the enemies and forced the league to overstep its boundaries    All from different 6er flairs made over the last three or four days.  I didn't bother looking further back.  I get it, the league did y'all dirty.  OKC had literally nothing to do with that.  Stop trying to get our GM fired just because yours was."
Al horford washed.
Well they‚Äôre not getting Bam lol. They can go for someone like Myles Turner/Al Horford though
Why?  It's going to be Al Horford all over again.
"Bro you litterally maxed out Tobias Harris,Ben Simmons and Al Horford why you talking?"
"Yup. NBA just doesn't really see much star free agency movement (especially when you exclude the players that are moving to create super teams with whoever currently has cap space, and look instead solely at the players that moved for the destination).  Biggest name that moved in free agency in the past decade that wasn't moving to create/join a super team is probably Al Horford to Boston, Terry Rozier to the Hornets, or Andre Iguodala to the Warriors. edit: LaMarcus Aldridge to the Spurs."
"But then this has literally nothing to do with losing those guys. Please explain to me who we could have traded those picks to and when to replace the production of Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, and Al Horford. And please tell me which salaries are coming along for the ride to make the deals work."
Come on bro. I believe tanking should be a legal strategy but OKC needs to be punished the same way the Sixers were. Look at the garbage lineups you guys are throwing out there meanwhile Al horford and SGA are nowhere to be found. If we got punished by the league for what we did then you guys should too.
Without Shai &amp; Al Horford then.  On a b2b.  On a 14 game losing streak.  at home.  God we‚Äôre garbage.
"You mean before they traded away George Hill, sidelined Al Horford, and SGA got injured?"
&gt;missing some guys  Al Horford doesn't want to know your location
Al Horford revenge game. Wait - he didn‚Äôt play? Lmaooooooooooo
Al Horford costs 27 mio a year.
"They were always dumb. Yeah Horford and Embiid don't fit together so of course we were gonna trade Embiid and build around the duo of Ben and Al. I mean, the front office isn't the brightest but they aren't actively trying to be horrible."
"Constantly shits the bed in the playoffs? They lost their first year in the second round, and then to hot ass Kawhi and then in the bubble season with Al Horford, Jason Richardson, and no Ben.   Do people think Teams just go from sucking to winning the finals in a single year? It took MJ like six years to get to the finals."
*Al Horford chuckles*
https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2875782-joel-embiid-trade-rumors-nba-execs-preparing-for-76ers-to-possibly-deal-star.amp.html I think the rumors started when it was clear al horford was a bad idea
"Experience. They need someone who talks defense, preferably a big man. They need to be told where to be, how to rotate, and what to look for.   Al Horford, Marc Gasol are 2 big men that would help them. Rondo is a great guard addition to teach them. They just need to constantly to told what to do, then it becomes more instinctual.   They need to be taught, and then practice. Granted, this is the first season of SVG, so they needed to focus on the offense. They should be better next year with time."
Could‚Äôve had Al Horford and George Hill instead. I get those guys are older but they‚Äôre much better fits and they could‚Äôve had both of them
"Al Horford, come on down."
Al Horford. Dude is making 27.5 million this year and all he has to do is sit on the bench.
"Of course they do what are you even talking about lmao. Moses Brown, Poku, Svi, Mike Muscala, and maybe you've heard of Al Horford. There's more NBA quality players than roster spots sure but the majority go overseas."
Have him go sir on the beach next to Al Horford
"How do you expect to win without former Sixers Legends Mike Muscala, Tony Bradley and Al Horford ?"
Had to look twice to make sure it wasn't Al Horford
play Al Horford
"Yup. Al Horford to fix their spacing woes, as well as getting a few better shooters instead of Roberson, would‚Äôve made them favorites honestly.   KD‚Äôs legacy would be even better if he won that ring in OKC because I think a ring in OKC is more likely than he thought at the time."
"You're not helping by saying Al Horford is the biggest obstacle he's overcome in the playoffs lol.  &gt;They win game 1, people were saying it‚Äôs over for the Bucks.   That was just Paul Pierce, and everybody clowned him for it as soon as he said it."
And the Thunder traded Ibaka for Oladipo and were going to get Al Horford in free agency that year before KD left
"Dysfunctional Celtics team or not Al Horford was the biggest obstacle Giannis faced until that point, Horford was a defensive mastermind, and Giannis dominated him. You need to add context to context, the Celtics were dysfunctional, yes, but they swept a solid Pacers team just the series before and people were saying that Kyrie was amazing (which he was). They win game 1, people were saying it‚Äôs over for the Bucks. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not what a dysfunctional team would do"
Marc Gasol and Al Horford
Al Horford was allegedly ready to sign with them in 2016 on the condition that KD stayed. That would‚Äôve given them a lineup of  -Westbrook  -Oladipo  -Durant   -Sabonis  -Horford   In this scenario Oladipo and Sabonis are likely traded for another star though
"CP3 had the 23rd most FGA, so he missed the cut.

"https://www.nbcsports.com/edge/basketball/nba/player-news/headlines/10105976  &gt;Lu Dort (The Al Horford Special, right hip, tank commander, Cade Cunningham) will not play on Monday vs. Philly.   &gt;Of course he won't. Dort has had a remarkable season and that's why the Thunder continue to hold him out of back-to-backs as they try to make up ground with fellow tankers Houston, Detroit, Minnesota and Orlando. This draft class is loaded with talent if you're wondering why tanking has gotten out of hand this season. Look for Svi Mykhailiuk, Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams to soak up extra minutes. Dort will probably see time in three of OKC's five games this week."
"In college everyone is relatively the same age. But when I got drafted, I was 19 and had guys on my team like Al Horford who was like 30-32 years old with a wife and kids. It was weird how two people can be at two totally different places in their life but be on the same team. And also just the travel schedule. - Jayson Tatum"
"Cap space is nice but in practicality it almost never works out in the way you think it will. Especially not for the Spurs. Im very very interested in how the spurs manage that cap space. It'll probably be the final indictment needed to judge the spurs front office.   I really really hope we dont end up giving 10mil+ contracts to Demare Caroll and Marc Gasol, while trading for Al Horford or something."
You mean all-star and all-defense player Al Horford? 1st team all-defense Marcus Smart? And another lottery pick in Jaylen Brown? That roster?
The problem is you're comparing a full season with playoffs included to LaMelo's 41 games played so far. If we look at everything LaMelo has shown us so far I have no reason to believe he would've done worse than Tatum on that Celtics team. Also I think Al Horford was the best player in that playoff run.
"It‚Äôs an easy explanation. Horford had been on the team for forever at that point, and Millsap has been an All Star for what, at least a couple of years?  Meanwhile it was Korver‚Äôs first and only All Star appearance. So while it was def Al Horford‚Äôs team, I remember it as ‚Äúman, remember that one Kyle Korver balled out and the Hawks got 60 wins?‚Äù  It‚Äôs not meant as a slight to the other players."
"It doesn‚Äôt. At the end of the day, all advanced metrics are flawed in the sense that it‚Äôs impossible to actually separate your contribution from your teammates over the course of 1 season. You need a 5 year sample size of you playing in a bunch of different line ups to do it properly. The jazz have like the 3rd best offense in the league, gobert plays a lot of minutes and shares those minutes with mike Conley and Donovan mitchell and shooters. It‚Äôs also the reason Mike Conley is rated as like a top 3 defender this season in most advanced metrics.  Edit: al horford has certain 5 year rapm samples that he is ranked higher offensively in than any sample of gobert"
"Also, with you being a jazz fan, it‚Äôs actually hilarious that you call Al Horford barely a star. Al Horford has a lot of the same credentials that Rudy gobert has. They both have 1 all team third nba, both are great defenders. Gobert is the better overall defender obviously, but Horford honestly has some great qualities on defense that make him maybe more valuable against more perimeter centric teams, and Horford is a floor spacer on offense and has a better offensive game. I feel like you under rate Al Horford similarly to how many under appreciate gobert"
"Read my latest edit. I made it right as I got your reply. I was saying that yes, I don‚Äôt actually think the jazz are the 2015 hawks. But I do think prime Al Horford was basically as good as mitchell is right now. The jazz are a better team than that team was though"
"Donovan Mitchell has similar numbers to James Harden in 2015 and Harden was a top 15 player then. Mitchell isn‚Äôt a top 15 player right now but he‚Äôs somewhere between 16-21. There is way more talent in the league now than there was in 2015, so comparing their respective rankings in the league is irrelevant. You can‚Äôt tell me that a team with Al Horford as the main offensive threat has an equal chance at the title as a Donovan Mitchell led team. You could also make the argument that Gobert is better than Horford."
"You realize that in most people‚Äôs lists, Donovan mitchell is like the 20th best player in the nba right? You don‚Äôt think al Horford was maybe the 20th best player in the league in 2015?"
Al Horford has entered the chat.
Al horford has PTSD after ever bad FT attempt
"You need a C who can play C on defense (protect the rim) but plays the stretch 4 on offense. Someone like Al Horford would be great but he‚Äôs too old for a long term solution. So a Myles Tuner-like player would be a valid choice if you want to go younger. Steven Adams absolutely cannot share the floor with Zion. How they can actually trade for Myles Turner is another question, but the Pacers probably are ok trading him if they get the right players back.   Eric Bledsoe also needs to go. They need a SG who can actually space the floor and be a 3+D player. Josh Hart is nice but he‚Äôs probably best suited as a 6th man so they need someone else. They could try to get someone like Duncan Robinson and alternate him and Hart offense/defense, but they definitely need a SG who can stretch the floor.   Ingram is fine at SF. They need another alpha scorer who can create his own shot. PG is iffy. I think Lonzo will try to leave, so it‚Äôll be interesting who they replace him with. They have Kira Lewis Jr (their pick from this year), but they also probably get around the 10th pick this year. I like Davion Mitchell a lot, if he can shoot the ball. He‚Äôs already an excellent defender and his ability to change directions is elite, but if he can also be a 38% 3PT shooter (big if), I think him as a possible replacement."
"His first two years weren't too far off from AD's. His 3rd year is about the same age as Joel Embiid's rookie year. Ayton was supposed to take a leap this year and prove he is the same caliber of player as Embiid as he matches his age when he started. He hasn't done that. Ayton was the 20/11 65 TS% guy in college, not Embiid and not KAT. Yes, he is on a very good balanced team and not first or second option, and yes he is on one of the slowest paced teams in the league but nobody saw this coming and even bigtime critics of the Ayton pick thought he would likely put up David Robinson or Patrick Ewing type production but that type of player isn't as valuable in today's NBA. I think there is a chance Ayton produces similar production to a young Al Horford as far as scoring in the teens and good defense but not MVP or DPOTY candidate. I do think he could score 20+ ppg with great rebounding and great switchable defense too though. Don't know if he ever gets you top 4, now that there has been a center resurgence compared to the late 2000's and early 2010's."
"Atlanta loves basketball, it‚Äôs just people don‚Äôt really have any historical love for the hawks franchise. We haven‚Äôt really had an exciting star in ages. When I was growing up Al Horford and Joe Johnson were what we considered star power lol"
Al Horford pretending to be afraid of the ball is an all time great NBA troll
"I mean it's fcking obvious now, but it was also hard to pull off and even risky.   Dumping Al Horford on okc, and still getting Danny Green in return, I don't think many gms would've pulled that off. Everyone thought they would have to give up much more to dump him.  And Seth for JRich, that was baaaallsy, at the time JRich was def considered the better player, plus they gave up a a pick in the 30s."
Don't forget his defense! Al Horford is such a versatile player.
What? You mean Seth Curry and Danny Green are upgrades than 35 year-old Al Horford?!
"Honestly Al Horford missed it by like 3 years. He spent so much of his athletic prime nailing shots 4 feet inside the arc, he would've been so much better if teams committed to having him as their 3 point shooting center. He also got bodied by bigs like Dwight Howard. If he came into the league now he'd be a regular all star, occasional all NBA"
Al Horford
"The Wolves traded Wiggins and their first-round pick FOR Dlo and his terrible contract, not the other way around, they wanted him to keep KAT happy. Russ and John are playing fine, just not quite up to their contracts, on terrible teams. You're also forgetting Al Horford, who was considered the worst contract in the NBA, that the Sixers traded to OKC for Danny Green with just a throw-in second."
Maybe Al Horford? I'm sure okc would like some more picks.
"It seems like a lot of centers go from that 1.5-2.5 assists per game (or 36 if few minutes) to that 5 assists per game (or 36) range.   Al Horford, Marc Gasol, Joakim Noah, Demarcus Cousins, and Sabonis from the top of my head. Hoping Ayton can do that one day as well, he just isn't asked to make many plays because of CP3 and Booker is playmaking SG."
Marc Gasol and Al Horford I named two players
"Really, it‚Äôs a dumb mindset to have and I believe that most NBA players would hate if their coaching staff had it. I mean you saw what happened to Al Horford after OKC said they‚Äôll just be selling for the next few years which isn‚Äôt the worst idea if you‚Äôre a team that has no chance at even a playoff birth at most."
Al Horford
"In playing fantasy basketball this year, I love how in the updates they'll just blatantly call teams out for tanking:  &gt;Pascal Siakam (shoulder) is not being listed on the injury report for Wednesday's game against the Nets. Spicy P missed one game for rest and another one with a pretend shoulder injury,  &gt;OG Anunonby (calf) is not being listed on the injury report for Wednesday's game vs. Brooklyn. It appears the Raptors have run out of appendages to lie about with OG, so he should be back in action tomorrow night,  &gt;Lu Dort (hip strain, tank violator) will not play on Monday vs. the Wizards for the second leg of the back-to-back. The Thunder are just making injuries appear out of thin air as opposed to calling it rest. Dort has been playing out of his mind lately and would give the Thunder a chance to win vs. the Wizards, so the tanking Thunder can't allow that.  Also on Dort:  &gt;Dort will not play Wednesday against the Warriors due to a sore left shoulder. Dort looked just fine in Tuesday's loss to Utah, when he hit seven threes on his way to 42 points, seven rebounds, four steals and three assists. There was no indication that Dort was dealing with a shoulder issue, so this looks like the Thunder are simply looking to lessen their chances of picking up a win Wednesday night.  They also called Al Horford ""the world's most rested man."""
"Al Horford. He's at the back end of his career, but he still has a decent amount to provide for a contender. He would be a great addition as a bench piece for a contender in the next season or two.   He's just been a quiet, solid player for so long. I wouldn't mind seeing someone like him go get a ring before retiring."
"Al Horford, maybe?"
"2014-2015 hawks. Al Horford, Kyle Korver, Paul Millsap, and Jeff Teague. No real superstar though."
"They get cooked if there‚Äôs a jump shooting big or the offense runs through a big in the high post. That‚Äôs why Al Horford gave them fits. It forces Joel to step up on the perimeter and exert energy. He‚Äôd be gassed by the 4th qtr.   That being said, he‚Äôs in much better shape this season and the other teams in the east don‚Äôt have that threat. Can they avoid switches on the perimeter though?"
2014 roy hibbert. 2015 korver. Even al horford made it avging like 13/7 iirc but east had 0 bigs i guess lol
"He wasn‚Äôt one of the worst players. He wasn‚Äôt even one of the worst starting centers.  Biyombo, Al Horford, Aron Baynes... let‚Äôs not even mention the injury replacement starters like Naz Reid."
"Sexton started off insane first ten games with 27 points on 52/47/79 shooting splits to go along with 4 assists.  It dipped down cause after that whole Net's game. Boston started to lead notes on how to stop him via double teaming on perimeters and clog up around the 10 feet area of the basket and leave LNJ, Okoro and a horrible chucking Cedi open, close out Windler and he'll pass up the 3pt shot.    Easier to shut down Sexton when teammates beside Garland can't shoot for shit, contrast to George Hill  and Al Horford and Muscala."
Al Horford?? He was more impactful than his numbers suggested especially on Boston
"Al Horford for recent league, Latrell Sprewell past gen"
"not getting fined for setting ""old"" al horford"
"Towards the end of his tenure with the Hawks, Horford was just starting to playmake a lot more. Prior to that he was pick n pop big who was money from his face up jab step midrange game. Bam already is a more complete player than Al ever was."
CP3 is about to get an Al Horford contract which will be neat
"At the moment, Al Horford is technically holding out."
"Barring a direction change based on the new ownership, the team seems to be barreling forward with KAT + Russell as their foundation of the future. That is in part why they took Ant Man #1 over LaMelo--too much overlap between LaMelo and Russell.   With that in mind, the top picks in this draft mostly seem to present the same issue once you add Ant Man to the mix.   With all that said, wouldn't it behoove the Wolves to look at trading back to add some more immediate punch to their team? There's going to be a rebuilding team or two that desperately needs some foundational talent and is going to get unlucky in the lottery, if the Wolves could trade back to 5th-8th they could nab someone like Jonathan Kuminga, Jalen Johnson, Scottie Barnes, or Corey Kispert that would pair great with the core they already have.  Here's three potential deals I could see  A package involving Al Horford + #5  Larry Nance Jr. + #6  Marvin Bagley  + #7  These all help the Wolves get more veteran help to be more competitive in the next year (when they'll owe their pick unprotected) while still drafting a high level talent that better compliments the core they already have invested in."
"This thread is further proof that ""ceiling"" should be exorcised from the NBA lexicon. Any discussion about a player's ceiling just devolves into an argument between the people who interpret it as ""the best a player can possibly get by maximizing his natural abilities"" (people saying Garnett, Jokic) and the people who interpret it as ""an optimistic prediction"" (people saying Al Horford)"
"I mean, yeah I didn't watch much of Horford, but if he's already putting up more ppg and apg on higher efficiency even when you adjust for pace, while having better offensive advanced stats, you cant say that Bam's ceiling is Al Horford. Im not saying Bam is as good as Horford offensively yet, Im saying thats definitely not his ceiling because he's already almost there, and it could he argued that he already is or has surpassed it."
Bam is currently averaging more points and assists on better efficiency than Al Horford ever did in his entire career.
Al Horford and Josh Richardson guarded Embiid last year
"&gt; I don't think this version of their team is as good as the 2019 playoff version.   Bruh this team has way better shooter and defenders. Its all about fit and J Richardson and Al Horford didn't fit compared to Seth Curry and Danny Green, who are pretty good shooter. There is a reason they have been amazing to watch this season."
"No. Unless you mean someone who was an all star once upon a time like Al Horford, then maybe but why?"
As if OKC is not sitting Al Horford for no reason lol
lets sign al horford to be this teams dad my god we gotta do somethin
Lol you're insane if you think OKC would turn down the chance to turn Al Horford and a few first rounders into a 27 year old All Star.
"Technically, Al Horford is reported as the one who wanted the break and not the Thunder benching him. Similar to what Ariza did earlier in the year. That's why they haven't been fined. The NBA would have to fight the NBAPA to do something about it."
Honestly. Al horford just agreed not to play the last 2 months of the season. Are the raps just not being blatant enough?
Al Horford is just straight up not playing for no reason. Doesn‚Äôt make sense that the Raps get fined but not the Thunder.
"What mental gymnastics?  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31148420/sources-oklahoma-city-thunder-shut-al-horford-seek-offseason-trade%3fplatform=amp  I‚Äôm literally quoting WOJ, Presti and Horford."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31148420/sources-oklahoma-city-thunder-shut-al-horford-seek-offseason-trade%3fplatform=amp  This isn‚Äôt rest.
Throwback to OKC listing Al Horford out because ‚Äúold‚Äù
Also did Al Horford worry about it? After he signed with arch rival Philly was he talking about how he was worried about racial slurs being thrown at him? My point in this is that this is the shit that Kyrie does and he shouldn't throw this shit out there. That's going to make things much much worse.
Al Horford
Like Kevin Love and Al Horford?
They could‚Äôve just got al horford and George hill instead and their team would‚Äôve made complete sense. I know they‚Äôre older but it still would‚Äôve beeen the right move imo
Oh you‚Äôre getting no argument from me. I‚Äôm a Sixers fan and I despised our team last year. The Al Horford experience made my eyes hurt on a nightly basis.
"My point is that we aren‚Äôt some place that attracts free agents all the time. Listen to what I‚Äôm saying, this has nothing to do with the wolves or your misfortune, so pause on that.  Celtics are a big market but we‚Äôve only attracted 3 mid-tier stars in the past 5 years. For a team that is tied for most championships, has a championship GM, and retired greats that bleed green, you‚Äôd think more come here but that‚Äôs not really the case. We typically draft and trade for players.  Al Horford went well, wish he stayed but he walked. Gordon Hayward was pretty much a mess from beginning to end and then walked. Kemba Walker got injured his first year with us and has been up and down. Turns out things aren‚Äôt perfect over here and we have a lot of bad luck DESPITE being a competently run team."
"&gt; Who tf wants to go to Boston?  Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Kemba Walker in the past few years lol.  They were also listed on Kyrie's list when he demanded to be traded, and Hardens.   this is such a stupid narrative"
He's as good of a fit with you as Al Horford was and he's gonna demand similar money. You sure?
Al Horford for Wiseman + Oubre S&amp;T
Clippers and Jazz were a lot better than the Celtics and Pistons...  &gt;Oh that‚Äôs right this is r/nba so rationality doesn‚Äôt exist and hot takes are the norm   It‚Äôs honestly hilarious how you‚Äôre comparing Jokic dominating against Rudy Gobert and Dwight/AD to Giannis dominating against Al Horford and Andre Drummond.
Al Horford is available üëÄ
"Yeah, when TJ Ford was with the Raptors, Al Horford fouled the shit out of him on a fast break.  In his own words it was basically the beginning of the end of his career. Mind you he'd had back issues before the incident, but stingers are serious shit with a lot of potential for getting aggravated in the future."
Offensively Jaylen Brown statistically had an almost identical post season 2018 as Jayson Tatum. And Al Horford statistically had a superior post season 2018 than both of them. So ‚Äúlead‚Äù is a reach.
Sure the hawks were in the playoffs often but that is not a hard thing to do in the NBA. They also never really had a big name superstar during those years. People aren't gonna turn out to watch Joe Johnson and Al Horford.  Atlanta has grown a lot in the past decades so maybe all the bandwagoners are just new to the city. I honestly things are going to change in ATL. Trae could be a big star and this young core looks like it will be a playoff team for the foreseeable future.
ben simmons didnt play. al horford and jason richardson were still on the team. brett brown was the head coach. tobias harris was terrible. way different sixers team this year compared to last year.
Drummond doing his best 2019 Al Horford impression out there
Gotta give Tobias his props. Was terrible with Al Horford taking up his spot and came back better than ever
"Hot take: Al Horford contract was a rookie mistake but if Elton Brand has been learning from Morey, when Morey leaves we might have our GM for the next 20 years"
We have danny green and seth curry this year instead of Al Horford and Jrich
Lebron played in the weakest conference of all-time. Facing players like Al Horford and Demar Derozan.  Who cares about getting to the finals by default and losing.
Al Horford worked out pretty well
Al horford can‚Äôt hurt him anymore
Shai  Dort  Poku  Bazley  Kenny Hustle  They poach Al Horford
Is Al Horford singlehandedly keeping OKC out of first?
"Ohhhh yes yes yes with a prime al horford, jaylen brown and Marcus smart in the east! I mean teammates def had nothing to do with it! Oh let's add kemba for last year too, he's been playing with 2-3 other all stars his whole career buddy."
"Same with Kobe, klay, Cole Anthony, bol bol, jalen Brunson, nic claxton,Jae crowder, Ed Davis, garland, jeremi grant, Tim Hardaway Jr, al horford, Luke kornet, Wes Mathews, jabari Parker, Kenyon Martin jr, Austen rivers, Sabonis, Gary Trent jr, Wiggins, Winslow etc etc etc etc etc etc etc   LOTS of guys have nba dads, not many are this good. Damn so hateful"
"There are a lot of bad contracts that could use an amnesty: Kevin Love, John Wall, Al Horford, Steven Adams just to name a few"
Is it not Al Horford?
I don't follow OKC but didn't they pay Al Horford to not play the 2nd half of the season?  Gotta give Al some love in this category!
it was widely said that cp3 was washed and on an albatross contract that only okc would pick up because they weren't going anywhere for years haha. they traded him and got the *real* albatross tank commander in al horford
"Al Horford is old and not good, and AD is an All-NBA player caliber player."
The one i noticed alot anecdotally was al horford
Celtics : not retiring Rondos number   Hawks : Al Horford ? Not too sure about this one but Hawks fans my disagree  Heat : Bosh jersey is already retired  NOLA/Hornets : Might retire CP3  Blazers : Dame will be retired but Bill Walton is the Blazers GOAT. Also thoughts on LMA Blazers fans ?
Everyone up in arms what‚Äôs left of Al Horford is not getting 20 minutes a night to potentiality squeeze out 1/2 a win over the last 30 games.
Yeah we call that the ‚ÄúAl Horford and Embiid lineup‚Äù special. It does not bring good results
"Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown. Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier. Sounds like a pretty solid team to me. Except it wasn't, and we know exactly why, because only one of those guys is still a shitty teammate. And it just so happens he was supposed to be the one that held it all together."
"I think his defense is good but not singularly good enough to land him 1st/DPOY. I think he might likely end up being around Al Horford-level impact long-term. Currently looking around the Center position in the league, I don't think he would pass anybody to grab that first spot even in a 'down year' when the DPOY isn't a Center. Embiid, Gobert, Adebayo; competition is pretty stiff."
"Yeah but Drummond put up relatively dominant rebounding numbers &amp; in general had a good statistical profile for selection. You could certainly make the argument that his numbers were inflated by his own propensity to miss, but that narrative (to my memory) has come around more recently and didn't feel as present when he got his All-Star nods.  Al Horford would be a good counter in terms of counting stats mattering less for an All-Star selection, but Horford also had the benefit of being considered a DPOY-level defender on an East-leading team. So Allen's team would either have to 1. Get dramatically better and be a top 3 seed &amp; Allen would have to emerge early as a DPOY candidate; or 2. Allen's counting stats would have to significantly increase.  The reason I don't think that will happen for Allen is that I don't trust the Cavs to become that much better lol and I think he's somewhat maxed out his skill level already. I guess either of those outcomes *could* happen but I personally don't think they will."
"If al horford contract can be moved, any contract can be moved."
Are you referring to Al Horford? /s
Can I interest them in one Al Horford? Add to their collection of former celtics
How the fuck does that prove your point?  The toughest teams the Cavs faced were the Oladipo Pacers and the Al Horford Celtics
"I feel like you're answering a question I didn't ask. It seems like you're trying to have the ""is Smart worth that kind of money"" discussion, but what I asked is if you think Smart and his agent would never think they could get the same kind of money that guys like Schroder, Lonzo and FVV do. I think they'll absolutely think that *someone* will make Smart that kind of offer, and that's really all that matters. The Celtics didn't think Al Horford and Gordon Hayward were worth the contracts they got either, but they were wrong to think nobody else would offer them money like that.   What do you care anyway? If he's so overrated simply because he plays for a big market then surely the Celtics won't miss him when he leaves, right?"
"&gt;1.	‚Å†They sat Drummond with the expressed purpose of trading him, which they did. I haven't heard about the Thunder trying to move Horford, their purpose is to give young guys more PT (and help the team lose more games).  The Thunder have been trying to trade Horford since he got on the team lmao. Since y‚Äôall making excuses for the Cavs we can say the Thunder sat Horford to see what they had in their young big men. That decision was not made to help us lose more games but to see if any of the young bugs are good enough to keep.   &gt;2.	‚Å†You could make an argument that Drummond didn't really help the Cavs, the Lakers probably won't be playing him heavy minutes in the playoffs. Horford definitely helps the Thunder.   Yep Al Horford definitely would‚Äôve helped us win another game or two lmao. In the second half of the season while Horford was sitting at home the Thunder got blown out in so many games but yea Horford would‚Äôve definitely changed a lot of that."
lol at talking about competition when Lebron played mot of his career in the east facing players like AL Horford.
Is no one going to post the ref doing the Al Horford troll flinch to Lamelo‚Äôs missed FT?
"The 2021 Suns feel like all those Al Horford/Paul Millsap Hawks from a number of years ago. They have an impressive regular season record, but no one takes them very serious in the playoffs."
My thing is why tf do you care if you don‚Äôt even watch us lmao? The same shit happened in Cleveland and Detroit this season but you don‚Äôt see people bitching about it. Hell Toronto rested so many of their starters to end the season but you don‚Äôt see threads about that. Shit like this is happening all over the league but ya know everyone wants to see Al Horford play for the Thunder. since were the only team in the NBA doing this (to this degree I guess lmao) the NBA should take away our draft picks.
"lol I said they were semi hot takes. I'm probably dead wrong on most of them, and certainly wouldn't put any money on most of these   Jazz would rightfully be favored over GSW, but I'ma slander them for a bit and say there's upset potential with the Warriors - GSW has the best player in the series, with a semi-decent supporting cast with Draymond, Wiggins, et. al, as well as championship experience, and those things shistorically have counted for something in the Playoffs. Meanwhile the Jazz are unproven - it might be overstated, but Gobert has had some regression in the playoffs, and Mitchell has his flaws. Their main advantages are their defense, which relies heavily on Gobert, but offensively, what they have going for them is they have a ton of good-but-not-great players, which gives them numerous paths to 4 wins, but they remind me too much of that Hawks team who won a ton of games, had 4 all-stars, ran away with the 1 seed, and then got waxed by Lebron because their best player was Al Horford, who's uninspiring at best. If you're the Warriors, who specifically scares you on that Jazz team? They're a 1 seed without a legit MVP contender in a season where people are stretching to find anyone at all to compete with Jokic, and the 2 least respected All-Stars. The only players who I'd really respect as difference makers are Conley and Ingles. It's the We Belive Warriors 2.0 vs the They Probably Don't Even Believe In Themselves Hawks 2.0. If that's the matchup, gimme Warriors in 7.    As for the Blazers, I think they're a bit underrated based on their record due to injury, and Dame alone has all the killer intangibles in himself, that a team like the Jazz doesn't have on their entire roster combined. Their defense is suspect, but I think they can hang with the Nuggets in a shootout, and scrape by. Ditto against the Suns, who I'm high on as well - I love CP3, and Booker is valid - but I think Dame is due for another semi leap."
"Funny that even with the draft talent we had, our top FAs signed were Tobias Harris, Al Horford and JJ Redick. All of whom we paid a significant premium for..."
all my homies hate al horford
"Man, I forgot Brook was on the Lakers for a season. But he feels a little different to me, because he was a big with a soft jumper, but he took a lot of long twos and then he just started backing up and bombing. Al Horford and Marc Gasol all into that category too for me; I think they always could have been okay 3 point shooters but the strategy wasn't in vogue so they barely took any. Ingram and Randle were both taking some 3s earlier in their career, they just weren't as good at it."
Al Horford isn‚Äôt awful at all (although definitely overpaid). The minutes where he plays center are still good even on the Sixers. It was when he played the 4 next to Embiid that he played really bad. He‚Äôs just too old and un athletic to play on the wing but is still very good as a big man
I have nothing but love for josh richardson.  al horford is just awful (at this stage in his career) and it‚Äôs a miracle morey worked his way out of that albatross of a contract.
Sixers also had an FO change that turned Al Horford and Josh Richardson into Danny Green and Seth Curry. That's what saved us the most.
"So because Joel Embiid can‚Äôt dominate al horford for some reason, the sole solution is to over pay an aging center for 4 years. I understand you gotta make moves but how about you put faith in Joel to get better and learn to dominate someone who is getting older and isn‚Äôt as good as you anyway"
"Because they don‚Äôt care about tanking. They want the big names to play, especially the ones in big markets. We‚Äôre only OKC, and it‚Äôs only Al horford, a former all star but not a flashy or exciting player. It‚Äôs complete hypocrisy but that‚Äôs what happens when the number 1, number 2, and number 3 concerns are money, money, and more money"
"If yall needed to move him, i wonder who could be available. Wiggins probably not, Wall/Westbrook bad team fits w/ luka... maybe al horford? Poku/Porzingis frontcourt for the thunder?"
"Deserved. They sat out al Horford with 50% of the season, rested Dort despite the fact it‚Äôs only his 2nd year, and has put out G-Leaguers for the last 2 months."
If Al Horford can get traded so can Middleton
"For the last 5 years Definitely remembered: LeBron, Curry, Giannis, Durant, Klay, Davis, Lillard, Harden, Russ, CP3, Embiid, Kyrie, Wade, Kobe  Likely remembered: Jokic, Tatum, Korver, Griffin, Derrick Rose, Donovan Mitchell  Potentially forgotten: Jimmy Butler, Kemba, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Bradley Beal, Al Horford, Devin Booker  Likely forgotten: Lowry, Aldridge, Millsap, Kevin Love, Marc Gasol, Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall, Ben Simmons, Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert"
"Wtf he somehow traded Al Horford for Danny Green, absolutely scammed the Mavs out of Seth Curry, snatched George Hill from the Thunder for 2 second rounders due in like 5 years, scooped the best backup center in the league from the Lakers for like $2 million, had a fantastic draft, has done like 10 other trades/signings to fill out the end of bench depth going into the playoffs, and has additionally managed to do absolutely nothing stupid (which is not a given in this league).  Morey has done an absolutely unbelievable job, dude committed highway robbery like 5 separate times already lmao"
Point god Al Horford? Why wouldn‚Äôt we be talking about the same guy?
"All Star 5.  This team ain‚Äôt winning shit until we get a legit Big or even a Prime Al Horford level player.  In a conference that houses Embiid, Giannis &amp; Bam. You ain‚Äôt going anywhere without an Elite Big unless you have like 2 MVPs"
"Nope. Him + Morey. If they run back the same FO that overpaid Al horford and didn't trade Josh Richardson for one of the best 3 pt shooters, guess what? They ain't the 1st seed"
"Ah that's my bad, I thought it was the 2018-19 season they were talking about so I thought it was after his breakout year that they thought Al Horford was better than him. pre-2017-18 makes a lot more sense, that's a fair ranking"
"A couple of things:  1.) This feels self-serving. Is Draymond making the case for Steph's MVP here? ""Westbrook had a bad team but drug them into the playoffs. Same with Steph. Hes a deserving MVP candidate too.""  2.) Draymond lead that Warriors bench in clowning Russ those years. When Dray got a triple double in a few games I seem to remember him saying something like, in reference to Russ "" I could get one every game too. But it doesn't help the team win."" Those GSW vs OKC games were particularly intense, if not terribly competitive, but Draymond was an instigator pretty consistently.  3.) This also feels like a continuing narrative he and KD like to push that attempt to justify Durant leaving OKC. ""KD cant play with those cats."" That team took GSW to the brink the year before, and in the offseason traded Ibaka for Oladipo. Al Horford reportedly was expected to sign but didn't get assurance that Durant would sign long-term so he went to Boston (where they thought THEY had the pole position on signing Durant) instead.  TL:DR That ""horseshit"" team was designed to have Russ/Oladipo/Durant/Horford/Adams starting with Sabonis/Grant/Kanter/Roberson/Abrines coming off the bench. It was a contender for sure. KD slit their throat and went to the competition. It will always be considered an all-time bitch move. And Draymond is still justifying it while also trying to prop up Steph's MVP candidacy."
We really flipped Josh Richardson and al horford for Danny G and Seth. That is so friggen crazy
Anyone who has long term memory should agree with this. Last season after the playoffs was the lowest part of the franchise since Sam got hired.   -We just got swept by Boston after going into the playoffs as a disappointing six seed -Ben was injured and couldn't even play in the series -We fired Brett Brown  -We were just one year into a four year massive contract with Al Horford and were already desperate to somehow get rid of him. Most experts thought we'd need to attach a first to even have a chance at trading him   Now look at us.
Yeah how dare okc rob us of watching the electric Al Horford.

"I'm sorry. The Thunder were the team I thought about most with tanking this year because of the hilarious notes in fantasy where they'd say shit like ""Al Horford (world's most rested man) out tonight"" or ""Lu Dort out (hip/tank)"", etc."
OKC banished Al Horford to Corsica and didn‚Äôt even make it to the commercial break. Cold world
They sat fucking Al Horford because he was too good for them lmao
bro al horford was old
Doubt it .  He would play with Dominion republic with al horford .
"Jokic, Gasol, Kat, Sabonis, and Bam are the top 5 for play making centers. Embiid is not nearly as good as any of these 5 players as a passer.   Al Horford - 4.5 assists per game over the last 7 seasons. Better assist to turnover ratio than Embiid  Nikola Vucevic - Pretty self explanatory here. Could be in the top 5 honestly.   These two are also better so that‚Äôs 7 right there. There aren‚Äôt many good centers in the NBA. It‚Äôs easily the weakest position.  So back at 8th-10th he‚Äôs competing with players like Nurkic for play making.  Being 8th-10th among centers isn‚Äôt that good compared to being 8th-10th among PGs or Forwards.   He‚Äôs better than average for the current lineup of centers in the league but as a player compared to the rest of the league, he‚Äôs a mediocre play maker."
"For sure, he gave al horford and Tobias 300m ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Why not make him a coach. I half think that's what the Celtics are going to do with Al Horford. Certain guys are just made that way.
People were actually trying to say Ben simmons is headed to china   As if he doesnt have trade value.   Yall mfers saw Al Horford get traded 3 times and John Wall once and still think some players are untraceable.
"""Jayson Tatum led the Celtics to Game 7 of the conference finals when he was just a rookie.""  The Celtics' playoff run in 2018 was built on great defense and a balanced scoring attack. That team had no stars. Tatum's impact wasn't any larger than Jaylen Brown, Terry Rozier, Al Horford, or even Marcus Morris."
"In hindsight the hate on Myles Turner is kind of ridiculous, especially when you consider the transactions made to get Kemba off the team in exchange for Al Horford who fits that stretch 5 role.  The issue with the TPE though is that if Boston wants to use it they'll most likely have to continue attaching some sort of assets in any transaction. As you mentioned, Fournier still cost some second rounders and he's an UFA. I know the chance of not re-signing him is slim, but they also had to attach a first rounder to Kemba to clear up cap space to hopefully re-sign him.   I think they have like 10M of the TPE left and I'm curious to see what they have to fork over to get somebody of note back."
"We also did have a roster with Al Horford and Josh Richardson. Our best shooter was Shake Milton. Our best reserve (with Ben out, forcing us to slide Shake in his place) was Alec Burks. Last year‚Äôs team was GOD AWFUL compared to this year.  This comment isn‚Äôt really meant to be a further indictment of Ben, but even with him, we still likely lose in the first round. Just not in 4."
You mean like Jimmy Butler and Al Horford?
"Considering you apparently didn‚Äôt see that I already covered IT in my comment, I‚Äôm gunna assume you didn‚Äôt read it.  It‚Äôs possible AD hated Boston and it was because of IT, but personally, I think that‚Äôs an obvious scapegoat for the fact that:  1.	He was determined to go to the Lakers and  2.	The Celtics were the only other team with the assets to get the deal done. It was 100% in his best interest to make the Lakers the only team that would be able to trade for him by making it clear he wouldn‚Äôt re-sign elsewhere.  &gt;	It‚Äôs almost always an overpay for tier 2 stars or a trade.  Tier 2 stars get max contracts in the NBA. Hayward was the top FA in his year, Kemba was top 2 or 3. Al Horford was the top guy after KD and supposedly KD was going to sign with us if not for Golden State. Beyond that, we hadn‚Äôt had real cap space for a max guy in like over a decade. So I‚Äôd say we‚Äôve done pretty damn well in that regard."
"Probably would have been 5 or 6, our roster was still shit with Al Horford and Josh Richardson"
"For sure, man doesn't have that dog in him. Philly is notorious for its toxic fanbase but a lot of people love playing there. Jimmy didn't love how the team was run but he liked the city and the passion of the fans. Allen Iverson got bounced all around the league but has always called Philly his home. Dr. J loves the city as well, recently Joel posted how much he loves it. Most players with that dog mentality have said that Philly is their favorite place they played. But on that same note a lot of players who don't have that, for example, Al Horford and Ben Simmons, have said that they don't like it."
"The sixers lost in 2019 to a shot from heaven buzzer beater or they would've gone to the ECF and possibly the finals. I don't understand how he's overrated when he is a top 2 center in the league backed by stats and mostly backed up by playoff performance. His accomplishments in the playoffs are questionable but I'm pretty sure this was the first year where he's had a good proven coach, and a contending roster that wasn't assembled mid season. Unless you count the Al Horford year somehow"
This. They should‚Äôve kept Butler and Harris and looked for some shooters with their exceptions. Instead they let Jimmy go for peanuts and decided to sign Al Horford to a max. Not to mention letting Redick leave
"Get Al Horford back, pair him with Gordon Hayward, see if you can get a couple all star wings with your lottery picks. That'll set you up nice for a long time."
Our team is actually well constructed this year. Brett had to find a way to play Al Horford and Joel Embiid at the same time with absolutely zero spacing. It was just setup to fail.
"We also backed up the brinks for Al Horford, let‚Äôs not forget."
So did Al Horford.
"But who could forget the signing of ""Giannis-stopper"" Al Horford?"
"They were worse because they were surrounded by josh richardson and Al horford. Now they are surrounded by Seth curry and Danny green, both high volume 40 percent 3 point shooters."
"Ah yes, middle aged CP3 and Al Horford. Excellent comparison to the 24 year old in his first year off a rookie contract."
I was so impressed by rookie Al Horford lmao
"There were so many people who called this to a T when they moved on from Jimmy and the reports came out that it was because he didn't want to coexist with a primary ballhandler who doesn't shoot the basketball. I agreed at the time that Ben was more valuable for blind faith that he would improve but there were tons of people saying this exact thing would have happened. Of course it's hindsight but we have that benefit, and you judge your FO's moves using hindsight. They're there to make difficult decisions like that.  Even at the time, we all knew how much of an offensive liability Ben was in the playoffs and how much Jimmy saved Ben's ass in those 2019 playoffs. I was against keeping Jimmy if that meant giving up Ben but at least you would have gotten a warchest of players and assets for Ben when all we got for Jimmy was fucking Josh Richardson and cap space to sign Al Horford."
"He obviously wasn't perfect--especially in the draft  But he built the foundation of a rising team capable of making the 2nd round with a treasure trove of assets to be used to build on it  Those assets were used to trade up from 3 to 1 to pick Fultz, acquire Tobias and max him, acquire Jimmy and let him walk after a year to sign Al Horford, move back from Mikal Bridges to get Zhaire Smith and a whole bunch of awful moves that could have built a dynasty--or more likely considering Hinkie had his share of mistakes at least a competent contender that doesn't lose to the effing Hawks"
A Joel hasn‚Äôt been? Remind me what he stats were against Marc gasol and al horford in past playoffs
"I think the off season thing is a strange criticism considering how weird the past 18 months have actually been for NBA players. Allegedly Celtics wanted to get off Kemba a year ago because he wasn't doing anything to rehab his knees while the league was on hiatus. This stuff has happened across the board. And at his best, his biggest limitation was the awful spacing around him (lest we forget he played with Al Horford, Josh Richardson, and Embiid on the court at the same time), but he should've never been made the point guard of these teams to begin with. Philly bottomed out and tried to draft based on talent, and they ended up with 2 players who ultimately limit each other in the playoffs. Their front office fucked around with bizarre recruitment, and Morey ended up highering a coach who used him really weirdly on offense. This isn't to excuse what just happened, he stunk, Philly are easily the biggest disappointments of the playoffs and thats mostly on Simmons (even though Docs line ups were garbage). All that stuff can effect his development on the offensive end, it probably has."
Still insane they didn‚Äôt give Butler the full max and didn‚Äôt try signing a shooter but instead gave Harris the full max and signed al Horford
"Simmons is about as soft and passionless as it gets in this league.  He's now played with Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, and Joel Embiid - if those guys couldn't put fire into him, Dame can't either."
"I agree, I'm just saying I think a middle ground will be found. While he obviously has to leave Philadelphia, I don't see them getting fleeced for him, at least not with Morey running things. Somehow, some way, a somewhat decent trade will be made. They got fucking Al Horford off the books, I'm pretty sure a Simmons trade will be a cakewalk in comparison"
Al Horford is a beast
Remember when the 76ers went from Butler and Reddick to Al Horford and Josh Richardson and r/nba said they got a lot better that offseason?
Al Horford is a big who can stretch the floor. Can you imagine how good they would be if they got him to play the 4?
"What's more interesting is how little of what that 2014- 2015 team became assets for them:  * The following left in free agency for nothing: Al Horford, Paul Millsap, DeMarre Carroll, Thabo Sefolosha, Pero Antic, John Jenkins, Elton Brand, Austin Daye (waived in his final season) * Adreian Payne traded that season (his rookie year) to the Twolves for the pick that became K'Von ""Red Velvet"" Huerter  * Following were traded for things that didn't matter: Mike Scott  (a 2nd that did not convey), Shelvin Mack (traded for washed up Kirk Hinrich in his final season), Korver (traded for a retired Mo Williams, Mike Dunleavy Jr. in his final season and a 1st that did not convey). * Schroder was traded for a pick that conveys next year plus a whole bunch of nothing. *  Jeff Teague traded for Taurean Prince and a pick that was packaged with other picks to get DeAndre Hunter. * Kent Bazemore and a future first eventually became Clint Capela.   So in summary, from that roster they only really got Clint Capela, Huerter, and DeAndre Hunter. 4/5 of the ""NBA Player of the Month"" team left for nothing. I remember there was a lot of criticism of the Hawks for not getting assets for their players, but it didn't really matter. Schlenk did a good job of rebuilding through the draft and free agency."
"K. Enjoy 36 year old Al Horford next year as your starting C. Your team is dogshit.   As much as this loss hurts, I know at the very least Morey will do what needs to be done. Stevens inheriting Ainge's mess? Seems hard to overcome for you guys."
Al Horford. ü§£ü§£ü§£
A team just gave up value for Al Horford‚Ä¶ there will definitely be takers for Simmons
Yea he managed to move Al Horford after that terrible season he‚Äôll move ben
I mean the process didnt force the sixers to sign huge contracts for al horford and tobias harris. And lose jimmy butler in the offseason. That was just incompetent management from the people leading the sixers after the process ended.
"I actually don't know where Aayton's peak actually ends up. He seems like he could be one of those guys who's happy to be a super steady 18/12 guy  with great defence, get his max contract and just stay around that level for like 12 years and everyone kind of under-appreciates him until they look back at his career, realise he has 4 chips and start asking ""how did this guy only get 3 all star appearances?"" Real Al Horford vibes in the absolute best way possible."
Uhhh what about Al horford ????  /s
"in fairness to doc...  * blake griffin has also never made it past the second round despite being teamed with chris paul, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick, james harden, kevin durant, and kyrie irving  * chris paul has only been to the conference finals once on a team with james harden, and missed it on teams with blake griffin, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick... and james harden.  * joel embiid has never made it to the conference finals despite being teammates with jimmy butler, al horford, #1 pick ben simmons, #1 pick markelle fultz, that big scary serbian guy, and a revolving door of shooters including seth curry, danny green, tobias harris, jj redick, marco ""the confetti cannon"" bellinelli and doing it all in the ""weaker"" eastern conference  * paul george is in his third conference finals, despite playing two years with the indiana pacers while being coached by frank vogel, neither of which are considered a good thing on this sub in recent months.  * kawhi leonard has made so many conference finals i lost count.  idk if it's doc's fault fellas!"
OKC. Chris Paul then Al horford now Kemba then  Simmons
"Andre Drummond, al horford, Steven adams, buddy hield"
"Asset management and accumulation has been positive. Resting Al Horford and losing at a historic level for half the season, not so much. We might be able to dodge it if we‚Äôre actually ok next year, but if we‚Äôre in the bottom five again, folks will be mad."
"Outside of  Al Horford, Trae is probably the best player in those two teams. Heck Trae is probably the best right now with how he‚Äôs been playing."
‚ÄúFuckin Brett Brown and Al Horford messing everything up‚Äù
I know but let us see what Morey has in mind. He turned Al Horford  and josh richardson into seth curry and Danny Green after all.
And Al Horford about to have a resurgence and go 20/10 :(
Okc. We sat al horford all year baby. Let‚Äôs run it back
Did you see the return we got for a decrepit Al Horford last offseason? Morey magic.
"Was that the Josh Smith, Al Horford, Joe Johnson team? At the time those guys were nice if I remember correctly"
"Al Horford is just gonna keep cycling between the 6ers, OKC, and Celtics"
Celtics trade Al Horford for Ben Simmons and a 1st
"You're gonna have to elaborate, cause the only guy I can think of who came to you guys from Philly is Al Horford"
The Boston Celtics trade Al Horford for Ben Simmons and a first round pick.
Al Horford and Carsen Edwards
"Lot of C's fans talking even though their team isn't above .500 and we're like halfway through it. We legit just had an MVP season. We haven't began to peak, and when we do peak, you'll know. Also switching out Kyrie for Al Horford is not a good move"
Al Horford?
Who says no to an Al Horford for Ben Simmons trade?
"Yeah but the situation he came into wasn‚Äôt great. ben Simmons al horford and Tobias Harris all had max contracts, he had very little to work with"
It's not Morey's fault that Brett Brown traded Jimmy Butler and signed Al Horford in the 2019 offseason.
"Paul Millsap, AL Horford, Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver"
Al Horford
Oh man al horford you guys are geniuses
Y‚Äôall must‚Äôve forgot the Atlanta Hawks featuring prime Jeff Teague and Al Horford üò§
Hey remember you said Al Horford wanted to leave the Celtics because of the culture? https://twitter.com/chrisgrenham/status/1406314691161473030?s=21  How you like those apples?
Run through Rozier and Al Horford. Built different üò§
"Al Horford and Iguodala basically did the same thing but iguodala refused to play, and Al Horford sat out apparently with agreement and negotiations from Thunders. Blake went to Pistons, gave his all and played through injury in the playoffs, but yeah he‚Äôs a bitch right?"
But but Al Horford loved playing in Boston and is excited to be back! What do we believe!!!
They chose Al Horford too
You just traded for Al Horford. Please just disappear
Al Horford really brought this move to light I love it
"A lot of that could‚Äôve just been the fact that he was in the right system at the right time; Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver, and Al Horford were all All-Stars for the first and last time in 2015"
‚ÄúBig (Bank Account)‚Äù Al Horford  the horford fam back in boston is going to have celtics twitter LIT. we loved them and they loved us
The point is Al Horford is a old man who is probably best as a backup center at this stage of his career not a starting center on a playoff team.  You got worse after the trade.
"That's a really dumb take. The Sixers massively overpaid him, no other team in the league would spend $100m on a 33-year-old Al Horford. The Celtics made this trade to dump Kemba's terrible contract."
If you could trade Kemba and a young player for KAT why would the Celtics have traded him for Al Horford?
"The major highlight of the trade was taking Al Horford for Kemba, but Celtics also ‚Äúdrafted‚Äù Moses Brown with the 16th pick"
Yeah facts I aint talking Philly unless we talking Al Horford
Carlisle not gonna be their coach.   But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a fair comp. Carlisle is more of a strict my way or the highway coach. Stevens just doesn‚Äôt have the toughness/edge to him that is required to assert command of the locker room. Al Horford did that job for him and I think Al‚Äôs absence has quietly been an issue behind the scenes.
"&gt;there seems to be a consistent pattern of players who want nothing to do with the Celtics as soon as their contracts are up  Yeah, Al Horford looks really sad to be back with the Celtics.  There's some disfunction for sure, but guess what, this is a high pressure, high stakes competitive environment. 29 teams will be fighting and angry when their season is done."
"What's insane is that they recognize Smart as the only one trying to hold the others accountable, but were also trying to trade him. Did they learn nothing from losing Al Horford?  This is also why building a team isn't simple. On paper, they may have traded for a more skilled player than Smart, but would have lost desperately needed leadership. Most only focus on the skills aspect though, and then wonder why their team didn't get better even though they improved their roster."
How else you expect him to get creative in dumping Al Horford?
Lol I think you mean Sixer fans and Al Horford. No one hated Kemba in Boston my dude
Your team literally did this to Al Horford less than a year ago lmao.
I hate to say it but Jazz would've been better off with Al Horford than Gobert lmao At least he could've pretended to space the ball.
"I think the Celtics did well to get rid of a large contract mistake and get a player back in Al Horford who can help them. Kemba's arthritic knee will not get better in time and they get out of the remaining $73M. It only cost them a 1st rounder which OKC will find flipping Kemba will be difficult as teams are not willing to take on an chronic, injured player. OKC may be hoping to have him miss an entire season so they collect on the insurance money to recoup the salary. For the Celtics, it will open up salary space after next season with Horford's expiring contract plus get usable minutes out of him. Horford is not the player he once was though he is upgrade for the position.  The Celtics did well in cutting their losses."
"Kemba Walker's knee is why this trade happened. He has arthritic knee and 2 yrs $73M remaining on his deal.  Considering its only costing the 16th pick in the draft and they get back a player who can help them in Al Horford, the Celtics are fortunate they did so well with the deal."
"Can confirm, I was a hater calling them the Al Horford Hawks"
"Go to [Horford's page on Sportrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/boston-celtics/al-horford-2199/) and scroll down underneath his contract to where it says this:   &gt; 2022 $14.5 million guaranted, $19.5 million guaranteed if PHI makes Finals in 2020, 2021 or 2022, fully if PHI wins Finals (@BobbyMarks, @JeffSiegel)  They update that information constantly, they even had Horford being part of [Boston's team page](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/boston-celtics/cap/2021/) within the hour of today's trade. If that info would have no longer applied as soon as Horford was no longer a Sixer then they would have updated it within the last year."
"I have a feeling the intent here is to save as much money as possible for the 2022 Free Agency class while filling out a decent bench rather than putting together a championship contender for next season.  Al Horford is a respected veteran that can really help out the young guys and Moses Brown is the type of player we've needed for years now. Moses is 21 signed to an extremely team-friendly contract until after the 2023/2024 season. Al Horford alone saves us a ton of money and makes it easier for us to re-sign Fournier long-term.  I know this might be a ""haha Boston fans think they'll get everyone"" moment, but I have a feeling Bradley Beal's gonna be a huge target next off-season for Boston unless someone else like Steph Curry wants to come here for some reason. Beal's a close friend of Tatum and has a lot of talent, which could be useful when it comes time for Tatum's next extension."
Well it all worked out great and you had a first for al horford so lucky you
Dwight bodied Al Horford in the post play after play. No shot Gobert could even dream of a similar performance
"That Al Horford guy was pretty good, good enough that id just really want to sign him to a 100 million dollar contract at the age of 33"
Imagine trading Porzingis for Al Horford and Mike Muscala
"bro, if we can turn Al Horford into a positive return, thats proof that there's a market out there for soft, overpaid, and overrated 7 footers with no heart. 25 y.o. Porzingis is certainly tradeable."
You mean Al Horford the one who can almost get you there but can't ?
"They would take picks from Dallas to take him. OKC could take his entire contract into cap space or send back Al Horford.  The Mavs can only trade 2 firsts right now though and I'm not sure giving them up just to dump a guy they traded 2 firsts for is palatable. A more realistic option is a Porzingis/Kemba swap, or my personal favourite, a Porzingis/Westbrook swap."
That's a good question and I don't feel equip with enough knowledge and the Mavericks to answer. Maybe they should take a chance on Kemba Walker or Al Horford.
Seeing Al Horford somehow get traded last season I‚Äôm convinced anyone can be moved
Porzingis is only theoretically better than horford on the court right now. Al is clearly a positive player judging by his statistical impact on the thunder when he played. I think he would‚Äôve been a great player for Dallas this series
Incoming Porzingis and picks to OKC for Al Horford
"Been floating this idea with my friends. Dallas get Al Horford + draft rights to Vasilije Miciƒá, OKC gets Porzingus.  Rationale is Horford's contract is shorter with a partial guaranteed in the final year and Miciƒá just won Euroleague MVP and there are rumours he is looking to jump into the NBA. These 2 are the most contending-ready assests we have.  Porzingus can come to OKC and revitalise himself in the system. It will be gamble if KP can get back into his true potential with his injury history but OKC have the time and patience to try it.  OKC can definitely sweeten the deal with some 2nd round picks."
Why would they even downgrade to Al horford and give picks to them ? It just doesn't make sense for a young star to be teamed with a grandpa horford
"Luka needs a real #2, not the corpse of Al Horford."
Al Horford of 3 years ago would be
"I don't think you'd have to give up picks to offload KP, if the Sixers can offload Al Horford and his contract in an ofseason than theres gotta be atleast one team looking for a 27 year old shooting center"
Sam Presti says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so sure.‚Äù People were saying these same things about CP3 and Al Horford once upon a time too.
Al Horford is gonna be 36 next season
The Sixers traded Al Horford. You can do this too
Gotta take on another big deal. Maybe Al Horford?
Al horford but mavs throw us a first lmao
He thinks it's the same as the Al Horford trade
"Porzingus and a pick for Al horford, who says no?"
"yeah 16/11 is an ass statline when he finally gets the ball  the overreaction is insane, yes he's not worth $30m but he's not Al Horford at the 76ers bad"
Realistically? Nobody.   Because only la handful of teams are gonna take KPs 100 million $ contract.  Maybe they can trade him for one of the other bad contracts out there but is Kevin Love or Al Horford better?  Because without emptying all of their young players the Mavs will not be able to trade KP.
hmm i might take kp over al horford
If the Sixers were able to dump the Al Horford contract than literally anything is possible
Al Horford was perfect in doing both of those things. ugh i miss him  edit: and his hot sister
Joel Embiid and Al Horford
"But didn't you hear? If KD had stayed, the Thunder would have signed Al Horford!"
"Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, ..."
al horford and svi makhailuk
"Legit no one is disrespecting KLove. I was purely comparing 2018 Kevin Love to 1995 Clyde Drexler, why are you changing the subject? Booker has sample size of 6 games bro, wtf are you even trying to prove here? You want to dive into ""empty stat"" (which I never said this was a case) players who take a deep dive in all statistic categories when they join a contender? Here is a list: Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Paul Milsap, Melo.  Find my quote that says ""Lebron made his teammates stats/play better""? Are you just pulling shits out of your ass now? So you can squeeze some comments out?  &gt;Sure you can bring up the finals team Lebron went up against in 2018. The difference is Hakeem won.   &gt;   &gt;Also, the 1995 Magic are the only team who can say they Beat MJ Bulls in their prime.  Uh, yes you are comparing Hakeem's opponents to Lebron's, and it is embarrassing even trying to deny you are not. What the actual fk am I reading here?  No one acted like that, you just hate him so much and keep thinking this way. Whole 2016 Cavs roster did the job, every single member contributed. Stop it.  Stop hating, it is so embarrassing to read, very cringe."
Are people this dumb? Of course someone will. Nobody is impossible to move and CJ won‚Äôt even be hard to. They can easily trade him for value. He‚Äôs not fuckin Al Horford
"No way, John Wall and Al Horford are still way worse. And Kevin Love"
Al Horford
I miss seeing Al Horford in the playoffs
Can we add Al Horford to the mix
"Deandre Ayton and Al Horford. Al Horford is the go to player that is often compared to with undersized and not freak athletic but talented prospects. Ayton has excellent size/length/athleticism so this comparison sounds off. However Ayton plays a lot like early career Al Horford. I first noticed this when I was trying to find other centers that were bad at getting to the line and Al Horford was one of the few that fit. Both don't explode and play physical basketball, Horford because he can't and Ayton because he just doesn't. Horford also was an excellent scorer but was never a 20+ PPG scorer and Ayton hasn't done this yet so far. Horford was also a good switchable defender and Ayton has this as well. Horford got even better at passing later on and developed 3 point range, I don't think the comparison to Horford will necessarily stick as the years progress."
True but Jokic‚Äôs passing as a center at age 26 is unbelievable. Al Horford worked in the Celtics system but Jokic is unbelievable
I'd give them CJ and a pick for Al Horford and Lou Dort
"It's a funny thing, too, with fans...you see it in every sport.  You draft a kid who isn't a finished product and will take time to provide ROI, and when he shows up and isn't a finished product, everybody loses their minds and says he sucks, and calls him a mistake and clowns the team that picked him. Either that, or they ignore situation entirely.   Like *of course* rookie Josh Allen struggled. He had a roster full of garbage and wasn't ready yet. *Of course* Baker had some trouble until the coaching situation was actually stable.  I don't know whether Lamar will suddenly look like a much better passer now that he actually has some NFL-quality receivers, but it shouldn't shock anyone if that happens. I don't know if Carson Wentz will have a ""miraculous"" bounceback with a healthy, stable team instead of that shitshow that was the 2020 Eagles, but it shouldn't shock anybody.   Just like nobody should have been surprised that Al Horford, when not forced to play on a team that made zero sense together, looked a lot better. Just like nobody should have been shocked when the Lakers *still* couldn't space the floor in the playoffs. Just like nobody should have been shocked when that 2016 Bulls team had problems with spacing (Backcourt: Jimmy Butler, D-Wade, MCW, and Rondo.) Just like nobody should have been surprised when the Wolves and Hawks suddenly looked a lot more competent when their good players got healthy and they hired better coaches."
"Yeah and we signed Al Horford, signed Hayward and traded for Kyrie.  It‚Äôs not our fault Hayward broke his leg in his literal first game.  How many other franchises are in better position to succeed for the next 10 years ? I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a short list."
woah woah woah woah woah... slow down... Al MF Horford above Jokic and Giannis??
Kemba and a first for Al Horford.
Al Horford for Steven Adams /s
ooorrrrr he could be like al horford
Why would you want Al Horford
"Atl has been so underutilized since Dominique left. I get they can‚Äôt control when they get a star but even during their 60 win season a couple years ago, it didn‚Äôt seem like the franchise was anything special or had any direction. Joe Johnson and al horford are great but no stars. The atl metro has 6 million people! Also their jerseys were terrible for a long time during the 2000s"
"Al horford, Russell Westbrook, Christopher Paul, John Wall."
if only they had Al Horford hmmm
"Actually, Al Horford for KP and picks. Thunder like picks.  Who says no?"
They should try to trade KP for Al Horford.
I think I'd rather have Al Horford than KP for the next 2 years.
They might get more production out of senior citizen Al Horford than KP at this point. Might as well give it a shot.
Al Horford
All I learned is anyone can be traded after Al horford was traded.
Get Kp the fuck off the floor. If the Phillies can trade Al horford kp can get traded
Al Horford seemed to actively despise every minute he was here. I remember that Kat/Embiid fight how that dude couldn't even be bothered to walk back down the court and help/break it up. Just stood there and stared like a disappointed dad. Keep your feelings to yourself and back your teammate up dude!
"‚Äúbetter than Al Horford‚Äù is like saying skinnier than me, it means nothing."
"how about Porzingis, Brunson, and Josh Green to OKC for Al Horford, 2022 FRP, 2023 2nd, Pokusevski, &amp; Isaiah Roby? Or another scenario where you send him to IND along with J-Rich, Tyrell Terry a 1st and Brunson for Brogdon and Turner?"
Now they‚Äôre saying it was Al Horford
That reason was playing in the east against players like Al Horford and Derozan.
"AL Horford sucks and plays a useless position and costs more than Fournier. The Celtics should have lost the play-in so they could match up with the Sixers, who they had a puncher's chance against."
"Not sure which random players you are referencing too.  Was it me comparing the two best players on the respective teams (Embiid vs Tatum)?  Was it comparing each of their best draft picks over the last two years (Williams and Langford vs Thybulle)? Or most recent veteran trade acquisitions (Danny Green vs. Evan Fournier)?  Not very random.  Roster building does not happen over one season. Some teams need years to build rosters, other teams need a couple seasons.  Boston should be the latter, instead, they have been the former and have not done good enough given the stars they have drafted, the draft capital that they had and their status as a premier organization in the league.  Not sure which random players you are referencing too.  Was it me comparing the two best players on the respective teams (Embiid vs Tatum)?  Was it comparing each of their best draft picks over the last two years (Williams and Langford vs Thybulle)? Or most recent veteran trade acquisitions (Danny Green vs. Evan Fournier)?  Not very random.  Roster building does not happen over one season. Some teams need years to build rosters, other teams need a couple seasons.  Boston should be the latter, instead they have been the former.  You are correct, my KG and Ray Allen were incorrect.  I did not remember that they were traded for.  Did Kemba Walker, Al Horford or Gordon Hayward lead to a championship?  Does Gordon Hayward leaving for absolutely nothing lead to a championship (no one would have given them a 2nd round pick and a bag of basketballs for Gordon Hayward?).  They were smart to let go of Horford when they did.  And if Kemba was that guy maybe they don't get their butts handed to them as bad as they did.    I think Tatum and Brown are great and I have high expectations for Tatum, but there is nothing anyone has seen that leads anyone to believe that they have the organization that would build around. But the good thing is that now they have turned the team over to Brad.  Good thing Brad Stevens has a reputation for being able to work well with superstars like Kyri...oh wait."
I'm talking about CJ to OKC for Danny Green last off-season when it was time to make the move.   The cap space freed up could have been used to go after a quality free agent.   Sixers were able to pawn of Al Horford for Danny Green and CJ is a better player than Horford right now.
"I guess I get what you're saying but Doc, Jojo, and Tobias especially have benefitted from Al Horford and Josh Richardson being replaced by Seth Curry and Danny green more than Doc standing on the sidelines. Both Jo and Tobi play in the lane, which was ridiculously clogged last year.   I think Doc has certainly been an upgrade over Brett but it's less of a factor than having a lineup that actually fits has been."
"Ya but that's not what people are talking about when we think about clutch shots.  Free throws are also clutch scoring but you can talk about different types of shots separately rather than going ""hurr durr 2 points is 2 points""  A dunk at the rim from a putback isn't the same as a jumper in isolation. It's not the same pressure and it's not the same skill as creating space and your own shot.  Dame is arguably the best ever at shooting from distance in the clutch. If someone wants to pull stats they should look at 10ft+ shots only for a point of comparison. Rather than including Shaq and Al Horford shooting 60% at the rim. Good for them but it's not what we're talking about"

Bring back Al Horford
The Sixers traded a first and a 2nd to get out of al horford who has the same amount of years left while also being worse.
"On paper that team was insane. A team where Jaylen Brown is the fourth best player, and you have Al Horford, Marcus Smart, and Marcus Morris too. Plus Baynes and Theis who were good role players. They were 1 win away from making the conference finals without Kyrie or Hayward and got 55 wins while missing a max player for the entire season."
"Sure thing. I‚Äôll list out some players that have been attainable for either team.   Attainable bigs: Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Al Horford, Daniel Theis (WTF Boston?!?), Wendell Carter Jr. and Brandon Clarke.   Attainable Guards: Derrick Rose, Malcolm Brogdon, Caris LeVert, Buddy Hield and even CP3/Lowry if rhey made a good enough offer."
So there you have it. You want Al Horford taking clutch shots.
"&gt;Durant admitted he was ‚Äúready to just say, ‚ÄòOK. Let‚Äôs go'‚Äù after meeting with TB12.  &gt;Celtics co-owner Wyc Grousbeck believed the team ‚Äúlost in the finals‚Äù of the Durant sweepstakes. Al Horford, Boston‚Äôs free agent consolation prize, admitted Durant told him he ‚Äúdefinitely considered‚Äù joining the C‚Äôs after Horford signed with the team. And there were rumors that Durant would have come to Boston if the club had managed to trade for Chicago Bulls star Jimmy Butler.   Man you're like 0 for a million today. Maybe take a break?"

"He was probably the closest to the hype Lebron had as a prospect. He was hyped throughout HS and took Ohio State to the NCAA final. Put up 25pts, 12 Reb, 4 blocks on a Al Horford/J. Noah front court that had decided to to run it back after winning the whole thing the year before.  Shaq and Tim Duncan had also won 8/9 of the most recent championships, so bigs were valued at a premium.  (Rasheed Wallace/Ben Wallace was the other front court )      He‚Äôs also probably the reason Joel Embiid didn‚Äôt go #1 despite being the best prospect that year."
People forget what he did to al horford in the ncaa title game. He abused him.
You can easily move him + picks for Al Horford. You can trade for John Wall and gamble it will be better. You can probably do trades for several other players as well just depends on how many picks you want to give away. Want Kevin Love?   Personally I think Kemba and Picks for Kyle Lowry is your best move. Have the Raptors do a sign and trade for 2y/ 65 million contract with Lowry and send Kemba and 2 lottery protected firsts
"We lost one game, relax.   Also he was healthy last year, we didn‚Äôt have Simmons and had the corpse of Al Horford and Tobias that‚Äôs why we lost  He was healthy the year before when we lost to the raptors. We lost because we didn‚Äôt have a good backup and we were -10,0000,0000 when he sat.   Joel has never been the reason we lost in the playoffs. He gets banged up and plays through it, recall masked Embiid.   You can‚Äôt be a fan, because it has literally never been true that the reason we lost in the playoffs was an Embiid injury."
We need PG and Wing help in FA not a backup big. I like Al Horford and think he would be a great backup to Mitch but we would have to be incentived for taking Horford more than OKC taking Kemba imo
Do you want Al Horford
"Dude did you even watch last years playoffs. We were starting Shake Milton and had no consistent shooters. Al Horford made Tobi play out of position and he really struggled. Also the fact that we were the best home team prior to the shutdown and the bubble was a death sentence.   This year we replaced Richardson with Seth and Horford with Green, essentially unlocking Tobi and giving Embiid and Simmons two 40% shooters. Not even factoring that our bench got a lot better with Dwight and Hill."
"Bro.. I think u got it confused, the mavs don‚Äôt want al horford either it‚Äôs just a shorter contract."
Chris Paul is Chris Paul and he showed he still had value by dragging them to the playoffs. Al Horford is Al Horford lol.
That‚Äôs why you trade for Al Horford‚Ä¶
"Last year, Simmons is hurt and we have AL HORFORD. The year before, we BARELY lose to Kawhi‚Äôs championship winning raptors. 2018 playoffs, ben is 22 years old and playing in his 2nd season, embiids 2nd full season. You‚Äôre acting like the sixers have been banging their head against the wall for 7/8 years."
Add a few first rounders and mavs should be able to fetch al horford
"&gt;How many centers can play all-NBA defense and shoot 35% from 3?     Anthony Davis, Myles Turner, Al Horford (when he was on a contender)"
"Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, RoCo, JJ Redick, Saric, Richardson, Thybulle, Dwight.......and also some guy named Joel Embiid  Like, I'm sure Dallas has had some nice pieces but it's not comparable"
Al Horford seething rn
"Lol it's not rocket science man.  6 years and the best the East puts out is teams led by Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry, Paul George and Roy Hibbert, or uh Paul Milsap and Al Horford.  That's really all that needs to be said."
"What on God's green Earth does the last three years have to do with this one? It's not gonna be Al Horford against D'Angelo Russell if the Sixers and Nets meet in the ECF. That'd be like me judging the Knicks off of their last three seasons, it wouldn't make any sense."
With Al Horford on the team lol
"Wow like a team that maybe has Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Jaylen Brown, and Al Horford hahahahaaaaaa^aaaaaaaaaaa"
"al horford didn‚Äôt add the 3 pointer into his arsenal until 2016, and it became a pretty significant part of his game since. i imagine that‚Äôs how kg would have been too if his career had carried into the late decade"
"&gt;Do you think a 3&amp;D wing (hard to find) and a solid center  I'm fairness we got Danny Green back for getting rid of Al Horford and his horrible contract (along with giving up a '25 first rounder, not a big deal). DG has actually been great for us on the floor and as a leader this season. We also got Seth for JRich straight up, while not quite a 3&amp;D, still a pretty big net gain and a starter for us. And then on the center piece, Dwight has been the first solid backup for Embiid we've had in years, and we got him for peanuts.  A good GM who has some patience can go a long way in grabbing quality under the radar pickups in this league without giving up a ton of assets."
For sure....I guess Al Horford wasn‚Äôt drawing up those ticket sales haha
Yeah Duncan peaked from 99-07 and Kobe peaked from 05- 12  Duncan anchor one of the best defense in the league on one of the best teams in the league. Spurs cut Duncan‚Äôs minutes and shifted the offense to Parker.   And also Al horford is like 3rd team all nba level. Which is what Duncan was late career. That‚Äôs not a bad thing
"The 2007 NCAA championship game is one I still remember from high school. Greg Oden, Joakim Noah, Al Horford and Corey Brewer all feel like names from the past and Conley is still going strong. Guys like him doing a lot of work towards making me feel young still."
What's wrong with Al Horford? He is a good player!
"who can guard him at this point? Al horford is probably drinking Pi√±a coladas in some tropical island, Gasol is ancient."
I remember reading recently that a big part of Ime's defensive plans are for the big man to call out the defense. There aren't many better at that than Horford. Could be a great learning opportunity for Al to help take Rob to the next level
"Actually Rob credits Horford as a huge part of his development and they have a great relationship from his rookie year/Al's last year.   If anything, a big reason for reacquiring Al was to be a mentor to Rob."
Boston fans are definitely excited for his development but part of me thinks the Al Horford trade was a direct sign that the Stevens and company are not satisfied with his conditioning yet.  Hopefully a full offseason and reduced load playing behind Horford can cause him to work on his durability. I wonder if he'll see any time at the 4 next to Horford.
"Yeah I think he's more in the 9-22 range with a lot of room to debate.  My top 8 centers this season would be Jokic, Embiid, Vucevic, Gobert, Capela, Adebayo, KAT, and Valanciunas. I don't think you can really put Ayton above any of them.   He's in that second tier with Kanter, Jarret Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Porzingis, Ibaka, Zubac, Christian Wood, Robert Williams, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Nurkic, Steven Adams, Theis, and Al Horford.  I think Ayton is probably around the 12th-16th best center in the league, though if he keeps up the form he's had these playoffs next season I could see him making a jump into the top 10."
"Is the Suns run (not 100% Lebron, 4 of 6 games of AD, MVP Jokic, MPJr, PG, and now Reggie even) not better than the 2018 Cavs run (Oladipo pacers with second year Sabonis, demar and Lowry, al horford and rookie Tatum)?  People sleep on how bad the East was, especially in the early 2000s. Beating an mvp alone puts the Suns run over a good chunk of finals teams."
Al Horford is up there.
"Just sign Josh Richardson and Al Horford, the blueprint is right there."
"TLDR: Basically the finals streak is when Lebron became Lebron and zoomed past other all timers to #2 on the all time list and some even think #1 (lol). This is when the ""he can drag anyone to the finals"" type arguments started.  But I wonder when this actually happened b/c in almost all of his series wins, he usually had a teammate or two who was better than the other teams best player.  So when you analyze his supporting casts compared to the teams he faced, I think you can make the case that there are a lot of other all timers who would've had a similar runs (10 finals, 4 titles) if they played Lebron's career out.   KD, Kobe, Shaq, Duncan, Bird, Magic etc.  They would likely make all of those finals except 2007 and win 4 (2011 Dallas swaps with 2016 GSW so still 4).  KD is early teens all-time on most lists.  But I think he would have 4 titles and 9 finals appearances if you swap him with Lebron.  So really the 2007 Detroit Series and the 2016 GSW series is the difference between Lebron being at the top/ in the discussion with those other guys 2-12 or whatever all time and just being automatically, unanimously put ahead of them at #2 without any thought at all.     A huge piece of Lebron's legacy is the finals streak.  You always hear ""Lebron dragged worse teams to the finals"" or ""lebron could drag any team to the finals"" etc etc.   But most of the finals runs, his team was way better than anyone he beat along the way.  It just worked out for him that when his team wasn't what you would expect to be talented enough to make the finals (2017 and 2018), they basically didn't face anyone.  Exception being 2007 when they beat 1 good team in Detroit.  Which is very impressive, but its also 1 series in 10 finals appearances.   IT got hurt in 2017 and Boston's leading scorers were Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder and Lebron had Kyrie and Love lmao.  Then Kyrie got hurt in 2018 and Boston's leading scorers were 20 year old Jaylen Brown (not close to what he is now) and rookie 19 year old Tatum.  And Kyrie was hurt, but Cleveland still had Love.  Forget teams, who are the best players Lebron had to go thru to get to the finals?  Everyone knows stars win playoff series.   Most of the stars he beat were either really young (D Rose 22, PG 22,23) or really old (Celtics Big 3 was 35).   Its just a bunch of borderline ""stars"" like Derozen, Lowrey, Al Horford, Paul Milsap, David West, Luol Deng. I'm sure I'm missing some, but its a pretty weak cast.  Basically, how many series has Lebron ever won where his supporting cast was actually worse than the other team's best players supporting cast?  2, maybe 3?  To compare, KD went nuts, but Brooklyn lost because he had to face a 2x MVP with 2 other all- stars.  Luka went nuts and they lost b/c he played a 2x champ and top 3 guy in the league in Kawhi plus prime PG and a good supporting cast (compared to 22 year old PG with David West, Hibbert, Lance etc but Lebron had Wade and Bosh).   Trae went nuts and beat Philly.  Embiid is way better than anyone Lebron ever beat in the East. and Philly is better than almost all the teams he ever beat.   Joker went nuts, but ran into a team who had 3 guys who are better than his 2nd best guy.  Dame went nuts, but he faced the league MVP.  This is all just this year.  The point is, a lot of stars have had great playoff series and lost, so nobody gives them credit or remembers them for ""dragging a less talented roster"" b/c they ran into great players/ teams.  Lebron just lucked out that when his team was sub-par, the competition was bad.  And when he won, his team was significantly more talented.  How many playoff series has Lebron ever won since he went to miami where his teammate wasn't the best player in the series (other than him)?  A lot of times he had the 2 best players.  Miami he had the 2 best guys in every series other than Chicago with Rose.  15 and 16 with Cleveland every series until the finals he had the 2 best guys in most of those series (prime love is better than Derozen, Horford etc).  Lakers nobody yet (AD best non bron player).   So 2007 Detroit is like the only series Lebron won en route to the finals where his teammate wasn't the best player other than him in the series.  And most of those he had the 2 best guys too."
"This sub is so wrong on Al Horford. He played bad in Philly because he was a bad fit and they had shitty spacing due to Embiid and Ben‚Äôs shooting woes from outside, so when he was on the floor, he wasn‚Äôt getting the open looks he was getting in Boston the season before where he was a key piece to their success. In OKC, he sat because they were tanking and wanted their younger guys to get more experience. Plain and simple.  I‚Äôm willing to bet that Horford starts for the Celtics next season and plays well and in meaningful moments during games. The Celtics are not in a win now or blow up the team mode, but they‚Äôre not going to take a bad contract if they don‚Äôt think the player won‚Äôt help them."
"Oddly enough, the change happened from '19-'20 to '20-'21.  They went from 26.3 APG to 23.0 APG (This year was 23.5, slightly up)  Which suggests it wasn't the Hayward loss that screwed their passing up, but some combination of the Kyrie-for-Kemba swap and the loss of Al Horford.  Horford averaged 4.6 APG over his three seasons in Boston, and since then, they haven't had a big get even 2 APG."
"Boston is less in win now mode than Philly because of their young core (vs Embiid potentially suffering a serious injury). They actually don't believe he will be healthy and that he could have a degenerative knee condition.  They traded him and a first for Al fucking Horford, who himself required a pick to be dumped just a year earlier. That's how big of a drag Kemba's contract is.  https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2021/06/celtics-concerns-with-kemba-walker-started-due-to-lack-of-knee-rehab-ahead-of-nba-bubble-report.html"
"I made the toughest two  Lakers: Van Exel - Eddie Jones - Cedric Ceballos (Ingram if you don't want only 90s Lakers + Baylor) - Elgin Baylor - Divac   Celtics: ~~Kyrie~~  Isaiah Thomas, Both Jay-jays, Antoine Walker, Al Horford"
Celtics   PG Kyrie Irving  SG Jaylen Brown   SF Jayson Tatum   PF Antoine Walker  C Al Horford
Maybe you‚Äôre interested in Al Horford? :-)
"He never did anything to us, its not like he's Al Horford"
Kemba's already been traded to OKC for Al Horford.
76ers maxed al horford wym
Ask al horford  to explain his numbers 1st .......
"The problem is that he's a low volume shooter. Bud and the Bucks love funneling looks to guys who aren't likely to take enough of them.    Thats how they shutdown the Celtics in 2019, they dared Al Horford to become a high volume 3pt shooter and he wouldn't do it. The Bucks also defend Myles Turner and the Pacers in a similar fashion"
His passing from last year to this year was one of the biggest improvements in his game (also helps when he's passing to curry and green and not Al Horford). I think it'll get even better next year.   His ballhandling in general could improve. Conditioning could certainly be better.   He's a monster and every single thing he has worked on usually improves significantly. I have no doubts that he will be even better next season.
"The Hawks can still win this. They need to do a whole lineup change; bring in DeMarre Carroll, Kyle Korver, Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague and Al Horford.   I have no idea why they haven‚Äôt been playing this game. Maybe it‚Äôs time for them to move on from Budenholzer, he‚Äôs garbage."
"Dwight Howard, Al Horford, DeAndre Jordan were at one time All-NBA centers that are still kinda in the league, its just that ""pure"" big men just don't cut it anymore in the modern NBA.  Jonas Valanciunas, Steven Adams, Richaun Holmes kinda fit the bill, but aren't as dominant as the first group in their primes."
"No Al Horford did, on missed first FTs."
Way more love than they gave Paul Milsap or Al Horford. Majority of the jerseys I‚Äôve seen people wear from that era are Korver jerseys too.   In all honesty no one gave af about Al Horford when he was here. His family shit on the ATL fanbase cause they thought he was boring.
Nash  CP3 to Clippers (obviously would mean no CP3 on the Suns. That's why I chose Nash over Chuck)  Kareem  Am I crazy for wanting prime Al Horford over Wilkins? I think Al fits better
"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
"Haha ok it was serious, yikes.   Every single coach that doesn‚Äôt win a championship (29 out of 30 coaches) ‚Äúlose‚Äù each year‚Ä¶  Lost 3 ecf means he won more in the playoffs than almost every other coach in the last few years. Would you trade that for an actual championship? Of course. Does that make him a loser, especially with the inputs he was given? Lol. You‚Äôre saying he‚Äôs a ‚Äúloser‚Äù for losing in the ecf. Applying that logic around the league, I can‚Äôt imagine what other coaches are. Look at other coaches over that same span.  You‚Äôre also calling him a loser for not winning a national championship with Butler, not winning a championship with the 2018 celtics led by rookie Jayson Tatum, and for not winning a championship with last year‚Äôs celtics team (without Hayward). Overachieving to get them there in the first place makes him a ‚Äúloser‚Äù.   You think he traded kemba a first pick because he wanted Al Horford that bad as a massive talent increase? Look at anything about the trade, it was about money and paving financial flexibility.   No, he hasn‚Äôt been at Butler in 8 years. But go with whatever timeline you care to make up.   You probably still want to run with your take you like, but this is wildly misguided lol."
"$60 Mil on the Books  Over 33 yrs old, Al Horford"
"This right here.    Including Smart in any trade idea is just lazy writing.  Now that Kemba is gone, it's the only way they can generate clicks on the Celtics.  They know neither Tatum nor Jaylen are going anywhere, and Al just came in.  So all that's left to trade cap-wise for a good player is Smart.  The Celtics are a far better team with Smart running the point than CJ.  Smart is a much better playmaker and his defense is light year's ahead.  And while you can never have enough shooters, well, the Celtics have plenty of firepower with Horford back if they re-sign Fournier."
"His contract is astronomical compared to his production, he‚Äôs dangerously close to moving into Al Horford territory where he cant be moved without throwing some incentives into the deal. You cant look at a player like Simmons without factoring in his pay, if he were making 20 million a year you happily pay that for a guy who can primarily contribute only on one end of the court, but for the 33 million he‚Äôs going to be making next year I think most teams take a pass unless they‚Äôre also looking to move guys on an overpay like CJ McCollum. We don‚Äôt have any horrible contracts on the books so it‚Äôs unlikely we want to take one on especially when it‚Äôs a player who addresses none of our immediate needs"
"He is a high production guy but not just high points/rebounds but high points/rebounds/assists/steals/blocks. I think the best thing to look at and see why people are hyped about him is to look at the chart under Sengun's section in this [article](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/30503246/nba-draft-stock-watch-scouting-international-stars-no-1-pick-contender).  The chart compares Sengun's production to other European players like Marc Gasol, Nurkic, Jokic, and Porzingis at the same age. He actually increased his assists/points/blocks since that article was written so he would have even higher numbers. Basically he was better as a young 18 year old then any of those guys in terms of raw numbers and production in almost every stat. If I had to pick 3 players to compare I would say Sabonis, Al Horford, and Kevin Love. An OG comparison he reminds me of is Alvan Adams at least on paper, not that I watched him since he played so long ago."
"Yes. Jeff Teague, Paul Milsap, AL Horford, and Kyle Korver were all excellent that year. They were playing great team basketball which is why this year's Jazz was always being compared to the 2015 Hawks. A team that was on a hot streak in the regular season. What helped is that they won a lot of close games that could've gone either way, so no one took them seriously due to the fact no one on the team averaged more than 17 ppg. Again, the team was more than the sum of their parts, and if you shut down Korver or Milsap, there wasn't another player that could pick up the slack.   Also, Mike Budenholzer was our head coach at the time. As you can see, coach Bud has always had a history of being terrible in the Playoffs. He's a great regular season coach, but completely incompetent when it comes Playoff time."
I‚Äôm not gon let you talk about Al Horford and Kyle Korver like that
I would like to nominate Al Horford for Milwaukee killers. Dude would get 20 and absolutely shut down Greeky Freaky.
"Why would either team do this. Philly gets the Al Horford redux, and Luka will rip Simmons head off for not shooting."
"They should have traded for him back when he was on the Pelicans for Al Horford and picks. I‚Äôve always thought Horford would be a good fit next to Zion, certainly better than Steven Adams"
"Uh. Curry got taken to school by Heurter because he is absolutely trash on defense. He‚Äôs a horrible defender.   I swear this sub things points = value.  Simmons is absolutely worth a max deal in the reality of what a max deal means.   Sure there are guys potentially better than him making marginally less, but other max (or near max) guys are:  * Steven Adams * Al Horford * Porzingis * Russell * Wiggins * Harris * Conley * John Wall  If you replace anyone of those guys with Simmons are the 6ers better? I would say file that under ‚Äúhell no‚Äù."
"Basketball reference gave Ben Wallace a 45% chance of getting in the hall of fame, they give D-Rose an 11% chance. According to them he has lower odds of getting in than Al Horford. He only made one all-NBA team and three all star teams. T-Mac was known to have a short peak and he was All-NBA 7 times and an all star 7 times. Penny was known to have an even shorter peak and he was All-NBA 3 times and an all star 4 times, both higher than D-Rose. Penny isn‚Äôt in the hall of fame. A lot of players who are borderline get in due to college stats but D-Rose‚Äôs best college season is vacated due to cheating. His comeback has been incredible but he‚Äôs not making it in the hall of fame."
"Idk why people keep inflating the timeline. The Process really only lasted 3 seasons (2013 to 2016). Hinkie was replaced in 2016. Plenty of other teams have tanked longer than that. Lakers tanked even longer (2014 to 2019) tbh lol. The only difference was how egregious the Sixers were about tanking, which is probably why Hinkie got canned.  Sixers at least played their best players during the Process. Other teams since the Process era have tanked by benching their best players (OKC straight up not playing Al Horford lmao) or claiming they're 'injured'. Other teams have also used shit coaching/rotations to lose games on purpose. I think tanking is fine, but the Sixers were way too obvious and obnoxious about it."
Remember Al Horford?
He‚Äôs been injured the same way Al Horford was ‚Äúinjured‚Äù last season.  Love has had a rocky relationship with management and the direction of the team which is why he hasn‚Äôt played much.
**2015-2016 NBA Season**  |Rk|Player|Pos|FG%| |-:|:-|:-|-:| |1|DeAndre Jordan|C|.703| |2|Dwight Howard|C|.620| |3|Hassan Whiteside|C|.606| |4|Enes Kanter|C|.576| |5|Marcin Gortat|C|.567| |6|Jonas Valanciunas|C|.565| |7|Kenneth Faried|PF|.558| |8|Karl-Anthony Towns|C|.542| |9|Robin Lopez|C|.539| |10|Gorgui Dieng|C|.532| |11|Greg Monroe|C|.522| |12|Andre Drummond|C|.521| |13|Nerlens Noel|C|.521| |14|LeBron James|SF|.520| |15|Derrick Favors|PF|.515| |16|Thaddeus Young|PF|.514| |17|LaMarcus Aldridge|PF|.513| |18|Nikola Jokic|C|.512| |19|Brook Lopez|C|.511| |20|Nikola Vucevic|C|.510| |21|Jahlil Okafor|C|.508| |22|Kawhi Leonard|SF|.506| |23|Giannis Antetokounmpo|PG|.506| |24|Kevin Durant|SF|.505| |25|Al Horford|C|.505| |26|Stephen Curry|PG|.504|  So by your measure Steph was the 26th best shooter in the league during his 2015-2016 season?
"We literally only lost Kemba, Tristan Thompson, and Fournier, and added Al Horford and Josh Richardson.   \-Kemba missed nearly half the season and showed close to no burst/athleticism anymore, and was essentially turned into a jumpshooter. He was streaky before getting hurt, then take away his ability to drive and he either scores an inefficient 25 or puts up a complete dud while also being a turnstile on defense.   \-We had Fournier for a total of 16 games and had a losing record with him. I would've liked to have kept him, but he was never really integrated well and therefore him leaving shouldn't be factored into this team.  \-Thompson was awful save for game 3 of the Brooklyn series."
"Furkan Korkmaz had similar problems his first couple years.  Language/culture barrier was hard for him, but Al Horford was one of the earlier guys to really reach out and take him under his wing.  Now he has a full on bromance with Thybulle.  Losing the only coworkers you have an innate connection with would suck."
"Why do people want 37 year old Horford at the four? I don‚Äôt get this at all.  Love Al, but he‚Äôs old and is going to struggle guarding anyone who can put the ball on the floor."
I'll take Al Horford and a pick
"We‚Äôll have to see. I think for the Celtics it‚Äôs all really going to depend on whether or not our new bench guys can perform and what we can get out of Al Horford.  If he‚Äôs the same guy he was in OKC, then that is low key a massive pickup for us.  Realistically, I think this is just gunna be a down year for us in (hopefully) preparation for a big offseason next year."
It‚Äôs like the same thing with al horford
"&gt; while greeting the new free agents  yeah, with a look of contempt on his face lol                &gt;  front office sat there 2 summers ago and decided to build around Ben Simmons instead of Joel Embiid/Jimmy               damn, you people make stuff up more than the media heads you always give crap to for making stuff up. How the hell is signing Al Horford to be Joel's backup because of his long injury history 'building around Simmons and not Joel'? They also signed Al because he was thought to be somewhat of a nemesis for Joel. Also, signing Tobias to a massively oversized contract rather than sign Jimmy had nothing to do with Simmons. Ben deserves a lot of criticism, absolutely, but people left right and centre are just making stuff up because they know it will get them karma"
Dumas did not have any reporting relating to al Horford
&gt; salary filler   Al Horford?
"You do know that Al Horford is still good even with his age, right? He is so good that Presti tells everyone that he will be bench for him not to ruin OKC's tank."
"Boston‚Äôs best players were a rookie Tatum, sophomore brown and Al Horford. Idk what‚Äôs your point lmao"
"Russ is was and will be an incredible player, the stylistic difference between he and KD was some of the most dynamic and fun basketball I'll ever get to watch. And Roberson would actually randomly have these great (by his standards) offensive games in the '16 playoff run where he'd hit 1 or 2 threes and it felt like they instantly became unbeatable. Plus he was one of the most tenacious lock down man defenders of his era.  But what's more frustrating is they had just made a trade for Oladipo and Rookie Sabonis to be their sixth man and seventh men, and would have signed Al Horford if only KD had committed to the team. They were about to be absolutely stacked, and while the Russ MVP season and bubble team w SGA and CP3 were both so much fun, it's hard not to think about what could've been sometimes."
I trust Marcus Smart to make that open three in the biggest moments. Id let Al Horford Take it too no problem.
I just said Al Horford &gt; WCJ
Al Horford is in the Celtics
Al Horford at center maybe
It‚Äôs better to have Al Horford on the team then just a large dead salary from how much OKC is still paying Kemba. So I have not idea what the guys point is.
Houstons owner called chris pauls contract the worst in all of business. He has turned out to not be as washed as he seemed at the time but thats more revisionist history. Additionally they literally flipped dennis shroeder for danny green for al horford for kemba while picking up picks all along the way
Why would OKC just buy out his contract and give up al Horford to do that?
"I could imagine OKC just taking about $30M on paper. Any deal he signs with the Knicks takes money from the buyout first I think at a 50% rate.   So if Kemba signs for $20M per year for 3 years, $10M goes to OKC first this year.   A $20M cap hit to OKC is bad but not terrible. It's about the cost they'd have paid for buying the 16th pick and dumping Al Horford."
"&gt; Meanwhile the Celtics traded a 1st round pick to turn Kemba into Al Horford  At this point Horford&gt;Kemba, dude was ruining the Tank last year to the point we had to sit him. Don't let his one year in philly fool you he still is a effective player."
Yeah signing the role players back and keeping last year's core + Fournier and Kemba doesn't push them to anyone's Power Rankings top 5. But it should keep the Knicks in solid playoff contention without sacrificing flexibility to improve the roster to that level down the line.  Meanwhile the Celtics traded a 1st round pick to turn Kemba into Al Horford and lost Fournier for nothing.
Al Horford‚Äôs cousin Jesus Horford
they wanted al horford lol. everything else is true tho. Also kemba was earning 37m here. we did the right thing except signing him in the first place
Don't care + you just traded for Al Horford from the same team + any 5'10 dude is a better PG than Elfrid Payton
"Only cause they're trying to get assets back or be neutral. Kemba needed a pick to be attached to dump for overpaid Al fucking Horford who already needed a pick to be dumped last year. Literally the worst contract in the league, other than maybe Wall. It was crazy how some people thought OKC could get a pick out of Kemba.  EDIT: Obviously Kemba was an all-star two years ago. But if it's true he has a degenerative knee condition, which was speculated by some (not verified), he immediately goes to the bottom of the pile."
We saw the same thing for Al Horford the year before
"&gt;believe that the draft does not have to be nearly as hard as many teams will make it. I‚Äôm not interested in what the mocks say about where a guy should go. Five years will pass and when we look back at this 2018 draft, we‚Äôll see a long line of players who fail to have real careers in the NBA. In the moment, the selections will not seem ludicrous because the mocks have brainwashed us to believe that the best prospects are listed in the correct range and order. So when I hear people say, ‚ÄúThat is too high [or too low] to take [Player A],‚Äù I immediately cringe. Too high or too low according to what?  &gt;I care about one thing when it comes to the draft: getting a player who does not suck. Some of these guys will be stars, some might end up just being role players, but I am 100 percent confident none of them will fail. Enough with the small talk. Time to put my money where my mouth is. Vernodamus is here to save the day. These players will not suck (and if they do, I will absolutely blame the situation and the coaching):   * **Marvin Bagley III**   &gt;I seriously wonder if I have different eyeballs than everyone else. There is a 0 percent chance that Bagley is not awesome in the NBA. I‚Äôm not sure that he has ever played in a game in his life where he was not the best player on the floor. Coach K said the following regarding Bagley: ‚ÄúHe is not a good runner; he‚Äôs an amazing runner. And then he‚Äôs an amazing repeated jumper. In other words, he doesn‚Äôt really take time to even land, he just pops right back up. He wants to learn, he has no demons, he‚Äôs a great kid, he‚Äôs smart, and has an incredible motor. He never has a bad day. He‚Äôs a treasure, really. He‚Äôs going to be one of the great players in the NBA during his time.‚Äù Coach K also said that in his 38 years at Duke he has had only one other player like him: Kyrie Irving. I honestly have no idea how he is not the consensus first pick in the draft.  * **Luka Doncic**  &gt;I have expressed my worry that Doncic might not have the athleticism it takes to be a massive star in the NBA. That being said, he is smart, he plays hard, and he can dribble, pass, and shoot. I‚Äôm positive he is not going to be a failure. He is too good at basketball to fail. He also has a massive tiger tattoo on his forearm, which is a big plus. More than anything, I have warmed up to him more and more since the word that NBA teams have cooled on him, because that means he is probably amazing.  * **Wendell Carter Jr.**  &gt;This is a little reminiscent of when Al Horford and Joakim Noah were in the same draft in 2007. I loved both of them and thought there was no chance that either of them would fail. It was just a matter of how good they were going to be. Bagley is the best prospect in the draft in my opinion, but Carter is also a beast. His fundamentals are ridiculous, he is huge and has a massive wingspan‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand his shot looks as good as any player‚Äôs in the draft. A smart big that can run the floor, plays hard, and can shoot 3s? Those guys don‚Äôt fail.  * **Collin Sexton**  &gt;I love Sexton. He is smart, he is lightning fast, and he plays every game like it is his last game on earth. An absolute fighter who routinely plays his best against the best competition. You need guys like Sexton in the NBA playoffs. I think his ceiling is much higher than most people seem to think, and I know, no matter what, I will love having this guy on my team.  * **Miles Bridges**  &gt;He can dribble, pass, and shoot. He is a freak athlete. He is a smart kid that comes off great in all of his interviews. He is tough as nails. You can have the guys that you think are going to be good, and I‚Äôll take the one that I know will be. Miles Bridges is a perfect example of why teams and analysts miss in the NBA draft. He will absolutely be better than many players taken in front of him and you can see it from a mile away.  * **Jacob Evans**  &gt;Cincinnati won a school-record 31 games, and Evans was the best prospect on the team. His sophomore season he was a finalist for the Jerry West Award, which goes to the best shooting guard in the country, and his junior year he was a finalist for the Julius Erving Award, which goes to the best small forward in the country. Cincy coach Mick Cronin had this to say about him: ‚ÄúHe is a winner. He shoots a high percentage. He‚Äôs an elite defender. He blocks shots. He guards point guards. He rebounds. He just does so many things, and he‚Äôs a coach on the floor. He‚Äôs such a smart player.‚Äù Umm, sold.  * **Donte DiVincenzo**  &gt;At one point during this draft process, someone asked me, ‚ÄúIf we saw DiVincenzo drop 31 in the title game, be great all season, and test physically off the charts, then why in the hell is he supposed to go late first round?‚Äù Great question, anonymous guy! The answer is because that is where the mock draft consensus has him slotted, and the mock draft consensus is dumb. He‚Äôs a big-time competitor, super athlete, can shoot the cover off the ball, and in the biggest game of the season, he looked like the best player on maybe the best college team I have ever seen.  * **Rawle Alkins**  &gt;Brooklyn in the house! Alkins was a high school force of nature who won three city titles and two state championships in New York. He had a foot issue that hampered his career at Arizona, but this kid has so many attributes that I love. Unstoppable motor, built like a linebacker, good-looking shot, and do-or-die playing style. He has been projected too low since this process started. Alkins will be a fan favorite wherever he plays. You want a Marcus Smart, Tony Allen, or P.J. Tucker‚Äìtype player when you need a big play in a big game. I see that with Alkins.  * **Jevon Carter**  &gt;You do not want to be guarded by Jevon Carter. Bob Huggins called him ‚Äúthe best defensive player I have ever coached.‚Äù Whoa. Carter reminds me of the kind of guy who is playing in the park where the winner stays on the court, and you could leave for six hours and come back and his team would still be playing. He was conference defensive player of the year twice, and national defensive player of the year last year. He affects every game that he plays in. Bona fide bulldog. Every roster in the NBA could use a guy like him."
"Last off season they could have taken on Al Horford for a pick or signed Christian Wood and either of those guys would have been a better fit beside Zion than Adams or Val.   Griffin didn‚Äôt have to extend Adams but that would‚Äôve have been a question to begin with if he didn‚Äôt trade for him. Any r/nba nephew could tell you Zion needs to play beside a stretch 5 to maximise his strengths, why can‚Äôt Griffin see that?"
I expected the back up c to be al horford getting paid 25+  Shit got done
And Al snek Horford
Keeping Brett brown over Jimmy Butler didn‚Äôt help and then signing al horford and Tobias didn‚Äôt help
"Tbf that was post process  That had a clean capsheet, good role players on good contracts, and a bunch of picks. They turned it into half a season of Jimmy Butler, a season of Al Horford who they then had to attach assets to to trade, and Tobias Harris on an oversized contract"
"Well they *have* got some top name free agents in recent years. Al Horford was one of the top players available the year they signed him, as was Gordon Hayward, as was Kemba Walker. I think Boston absolutely *can* get free agents to sign there, but their ownership is generally pretty cheap and has not traditionally been willing to go into the luxury tax unless the team is without question a title contender."
"Crazy how a Hawks flair still thinks that the pace and space concept is an absolute necessity to win.   Playoffs slow down, where it‚Äôs about grind it out (often times iso) basketball.   That Al Horford hawks #1 seed that got clapped didn‚Äôt it? Had good 3 pt shooters and floor spacing, right?"
"The timeline would be similar but there a ton of killer mistakes made and some terrible luck.  Having so many busts or underachieving picks. Okafor, Fultz, Zhaire Smith, and to some degree Simmons.  The year we had to sign the right guys we ended up with Tobias Harris and Al Horford.  So many wasted assets. Hinkie built up a war chest and it was squandered completely when it was time to turn it in."
"They had so much potential, a max salary slot available with an elite team already and they wasted it on al horford smh"
"That's what happens when the Coangelo's showed up and said ""look at all these assets wow. Let's go spend them all on Tobias Harris and Al Horford!"""
Al Horford
"RDAmbition, infamous insider who broke the news of Al Horford to the Sixers, but got Kawhi to the Lakers wrong."
"And then Lebron and AD showed up a year after.  You might not understand this as a Lakers fan, but most franchises dont get all star free agents at all.  Small market teams never get free agents.  Even bigger markets like Chicago and Philly don‚Äôt have the pull of NY/LA.  The Sixers biggest FA signing in the past 30+ years was Al Horford, who they had to vastly overpay to get.     NY/LA/MIA teams have gotten Lebron, Ad, Kawhi, Paul George, KD, Kyrie, Harden, Butler and Lowry all either signing there or demanding to be traded there in the past 3 years.  You can‚Äôt ignore there is a massive advantage being located in those cities"
"Entering the 2017-18 season we had:  Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris, and Aron Baynes.  We also controlled the rights to Sacramento's draft pick in 2019 and had the Grizzlies first-round pick protected 1-7 until 2021.   It was such a ridiculous position to be in that Zach Lowe at that time called it maybe the greatest rebuild in the history of the NBA coming off the KG-Pierce trade where we blew it up.   Now, only 3 of those players remain, and both of those draft picks that were thought to be treasured assets turned into late-lottery picks. It's unbelievable.   Curse of IT is/was real. Let's hope it's ended now that Danny is gone."
Sixers are always quiet too unless they're giving Al Horford 100M
&gt; Making Al Horford the only real playmaker  As opposed to who? We didn't lose any playmakers this off-season so unless we trade Smart...
Bricks are so loud it's making me react like Al Horford
You guys just lost your 3rd and 4th best scorers and replaced them with the corpse of Al Horford. How is it I know your team better than you do?
"&gt;At the very least, with some playmaking just by adding Horford.   At the expense of losing your 3rd and 4th best scorers. You guys really are Pollyannas over there, aren't you? Making Al Horford the only real playmaker on the roster is not a great way to build a winner. I guess what you guys have working in your favor is last year's team is a pretty low bar to step over. Best of luck."
"Were they correct when they let Horford go so they could instead sign Kemba? If so, why did they end up trading Kemba and a 1st to swap him for Al Horford?"
I mean that's a risk with every superstar. There is no back up plan for your mvp going down so why try to half measure it and give al horford the bag for example? Either try to win with him or gtfo basically it what it comes down to. Scared money don't make money.
"2019: ""That's too much money to spend on Al Horford! Glad we let him go.""  2020: ""That's too much money to spend on Gordon Hayward! Glad we let him go.""  2021: ""That's too much money to spend on Evan Fournier! Glad we let him go.""  Bonus 2021: ""That's too much money to spend on Kemba Walker! Glad we gave up a first round pick to swap him for Al Horford."""
The 76ers were an even better team that still paid an unreachable total for Al Horford.
"Just because you can play him alongside Jarrett Allen, doesn't mean you should.  Just because Anthony Davis can play alongside Dwight Howard doesn't mean he should.  Just because Chris Bosh can play alongside Joel Anthony doesn't mean he should.  Just because Al Horford can play alongside Joel Embiid doesn't mean he should."
"The year is 2034, Jayson Tatum has retired. Brad Stevens is rolling out a starting five of Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Al Horford"
"Nah, check his stats from OKC last year. He's not 2014 Al, but he's still going to contribute. Remember, with Rob Williams not able to stay healthy, the most of our C minutes last year were Tristan Thompson's. You can't even pretend to argue that Horford isn't an upgrade over him ."
1. Wouldn't be 20m.   Players are paid based on games played (although there are injury protections).  So if you play Dinwiddie 20m and then trade him midseason you'd only owe ~10m.    Considering 2nd round picks can go for 3-4m that's a pretty good price for a much more valuable 1st.   2. OKC are already pretty much paying more than that right now.    They paid Chris Paul 39m so they could trade him for draft picks from the Suns.    They paid Al Horford 28m so they could trade him for #16 from Boston.   Now they're looking to pay Walker 36m and they're going to try and trade him for pick(s).
The ghost of Al Horford?
I don't know - I think ideally they'd like more of an actual point guard.  Still wishing for a Ricky Rubio trade - I think a table-setting point guard would do wonders next to both of the Jays and ideally Al Horford can cover for Rubio's iffy 3-point shot.
Players get overpaid and then they still end up getting traded back to the teams that originally wanted them.  Sources: Rondo and Al Horford

Dude played most of his freshman season at OSU with a broken wrist in his dominant hand. Still killed everyone. Gave Jo Noah and Al Horford the business in the national championship and nearly won it by himself. He would have been a legend.
"Al Horford, waited until Jah and Nerlens had negative value to trade them, maxed out Tobias Harris, never once brought in a starting caliber point guard, traded Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith on draft night after embarrassing his mom on national TV, sold second round picks for cash annually  For starters"
"This is pretty disingenuous nobody considered jeff teague, kyle korver (who was an injury replacement), paul millsap and Al Horford legitimate ""stars"" that year  That guy might be a russ hater idk but I dont see how two superstars being AD and LeBron (both who are imo top 10 players) along with russ who with his flaws is still a star player in this league   Its a superteam and I'm not afraid to admit that"
"The league changes so quickly.  Ben Simmons has a poisonous contract that scares most fan bases.  It‚Äôs like a 4 year contract though.  When he has a good season this year, we might all change our mind.  Kyle Lowry is so old.  He‚Äôs probably the most coveted free agent this offseason.  If he starts to have a bad season, his contract will suddenly be terrible!  Mike Conley had a terrible contract before and Chris Paul!  And now they‚Äôre highly coveted!  It makes you wonder what will happen with guys like Steven Adams, Kemba Walker, Al Horford.  The players are people and people can change, they can fully return from injury, fit in a better system, improve, etc. and we all just have to react to it and change our perception"

"Kemba walker, al horford, Gordon Hayward, all max contracts but sure keep tryna fit your narrative lol"
"The thing is, Horford is literally in that ""older and more injury prone"" category. The man is already 35 and had a history of recurrent knee issues when he was with us 3 years ago. I'm not trying to hate I love Big Al,  but lets be realistic he's no spring chicken anymore."
I can't believe we traded Jimmy Butler for this guy. I can't believe we traded 2 first round picks and Shamet for Tobias Harris and then gave him a max contract. I can't believe we spent our cap space on a 4 year contract for Al Horford. Wtf was Elton Brand thinking?
Moses is a fine player for the contract he is on. That is such an essential part of valuing the player - he averaged 8 &amp; 9 this season in 18 MPG while he is being paid 1.8 mil for the next 3 years. Our only Centers are now timelord who has significant injury concerns while also being on the last year of his rookie deal and 35 year old Al Horford. Grant Williams and Bruno are not 5s.
So we got Josh Richardson and Al Horford and dumped a pick to get off Kemba. Its proactive at least
Al Horford
"lebron &gt; embiid ad &gt; simmons westbrook &gt; al horford  defense AND playmaking, not just defense"
"No it won't. That's the exact same thing they said about the Sixers when they got AL Horford, that their defense would make up for their lack of spacing. You can't expect to not be a shooting team in a shooting league."
I mean he already was. For the unfortunate reason of dominating Al Horford on the post-season boards year after year
"I stopped listening less than 8 1/2 minutes in.          They don't understand that Al Horford was never available to the Pelicans. He started the whole transaction tree in Philadelphia. The Thunder even traded George Hill for him, so there's no world where we can even have Horford, let alone Horford AND Hill.  Simmons got the details of the Boogie Cousins trade wrong too. Said the Pelicans gave up 2 firsts instead of one. Maybe he was conflating it with the Mirotic trade."
it means he didn‚Äôt phone it in einstein     although i understand why you think tristan wasn‚Äôt playing up to his potential considering he made al Horford his bitch every year in the playoffs
"J Rich and Al Horford.  You'll love it boston, they're awesome floor spacers and Josh is also a great play maker too. you should be excited. Great amount of length and size too."
JRich and Al Horford coming back to us as enemies!
"You're not getting a 20 PPG scorer for the MLE, my friend. The Celtics are already down 20 PPG from Kemba, if we let Fournier walk as well, I'll say again, we are fucked offensively. Marcus Smart and Al Horford aren't making up that difference, and in order to get someone to pick up the slack, we're actually going to have to trade someone because we don't have the space to sign anyone anyways. The Celtics need Fournier."
Moses Brown and Al horford
Al Horford/Robert Williams/Moses Brown/Bruno Fernando
"Yeah explained why leaving Al Horford open for 3 was actually a good idea, then joked that the Bucks shouldn't do it to Morris, who had no conscience and doesn't pass up shots."
Didn‚Äôt y‚Äôall just trade your biggest FA signing for a 38 yr old Al Horford?  Yaaa ite. Boston fans should really be focused on themselves.
"OKC. Al Horford would've signed with us contingent on KD re-signing. Ibaka for Oladipo trade could still have happened, but lineup could've been something like WB/All-Defense Roberson/KD/Ibaka/Horford or WB/Oladipo/Roberson/KD/Horford  Like the hardest road shit already made me sad enough, but hearing what the roster could have been had KD signed makes it sting more"
"Beal fits in the lineup. We‚Äôd have Romeo or Pritchard starting at point guard, Beal at SG, Brown at SF, Tatum at PF, and Al Horford at C assuming we trade Robert Williams and Marcus Smart plus other assets for Beal.   That lineup is star studded and maybe the best shooting lineup in the NBA with every player (if Pritchard starts) having great range. Defensively it wouldn‚Äôt be terrible either and it‚Äôd actually be pretty good on defense if Romeo becomes starter.   I understand concerns with fit but honestly I think it would fit nicely."
We have 3 starting caliber bigs tf?  Not only do we have who I believe when healthy is a top 10 big in Robert Williams but we have Al Horford and Tristan Thompson. If anything we need to trade a big for a PG.
"I said it before the failed Al Horford experiment and I'll say it again, gotta wait before saying it's a failure.  I agree with you, star power suddenly became underrated after this trade and this team can beat a team with a better fit just off of star power."
"Not re-signing Fournier would give us a backcourt of Lonzo Ball and Marcus Smart. TD Garden would sink into the earth with the amount of bricks being tossed around. Not only that, but I'll paste in something I wrote the other day about how critical it is for us to bring back Fournier:  * If we don't re-sign Fournier, then we literally wasted 2 2nds on 16 covid-limited games of Evan Fournier for no reason.  * If wasting 2 2nds doesn't bother you, then it also completely wastes the record TPE from Hayward, which we could have just saved for this offseason. We now only have slightly more than the MLE remaining, which will get us basically a MLE level player - Fournier is much better than that.  * Fournier ended the season with 17 PPG, making him the 4th best scorer on the team (3rd with Kemba gone). It can easily be argued that with a full season and increased role, he could replace Kemba's output by himself.  * Fournier is a natural off-ball 2 guard and has all the skills that come with that (cutting, quick decisions without needing to iso, quick shooting motion - all things we desperately need), and he shot 41% on 6.7 attempts from 3 last year which made him the best 3 point shooter on the roster.  * If we let Fournier walk, we will have essentially traded two 20 PPG scorers, capable of catching fire on any given night, for 35 year old Al Horford and...Josh Richardson? Reggie Bullock? Whoever it is, it's too much of an offensive drop off to handle.   Letting Fournier go would be a disastrous misfire and we have no real way to replace him."
OKC turning Al Horford and Moses Brown into 2 firsts is kinda neat lol.
So they can trade fox for Al Horford /s
"Dude, Brian Colangelo traded up to get Fultz.  Then his replacement signed Al Horford.  Tell me again GMs are stupid."
It's karma for not getting punished for just sending Al Horford home. If the spurs tried that shit they would've been fined and punished to hell
I get that he can play 4. But saying he‚Äôs a ‚Äú4‚Äùimplies it‚Äôs his natural position. It‚Äôs not imo. Al Horford is a 4 who plays 5. That isn‚Äôt what Hunter is. I get Hunter isn‚Äôt a Brad Beal/Avery Bradley size score or defender but to me his best position would be as combo guard alongside Trae
I‚Äôd argue the Al Horford trade was a win too. Got us DG and only had to give up one FRP to get rid of that horrible contract.   It was also a win for OKC since they got another FRP trading Horford away
"Order of importance of things to add for me  * Not add but lose weight. I think he'd still be unstoppable in the post if he were 20lbs lighter and it would let him play longer and more explosively, not to mention it would put less stress on his knees.  * Passing, duh. Not much need to be said here, he doesn't have to be Jokic, but it'd be nice if he could find the occasional cutter. He has already shown tremendous improvement, so I think he'll get there eventually.  * A basic hook shot from the right block, maybe one that uses the glass like Al Horford. I feel like he posts up 90% of the time from the left block, which obviously suits him, but he lacks fluidity in his moves from the right. I think he could benefit immensely if he had a go-to move from there too.  * Better PnR fundamentals. That is obviously highly dependent on his surrounding personnel, but you never see him rolling with purpose after setting a screen.  * A friend. Get TJ, JJ or Simba back, I truly think it makes a difference for him mentally."
Less to do with believing in positions and more to do with last season when Tobias played alongside Embiid and Al Horford.
"As you say it's theoretical, but tanking and acquiring assets is the easy part. The hard part isn't Sam Presti acquiring every pick in the league it's turning those picks into a contender. Hinkie never had to do the hard part so we don't know.   Do you trade Jason Tatum for Kawhi? How about for Anthony Davis? Do you trade up for Markel Fultz to finally solve your guard problem? How about trade for Jimmy Buttler? Sign Al Horford? Trade for Kyle Lowry? Hinke never had to make any of those hard decisions. He essentially gets to have a reputation for being a genius for doing a long tank job and never had to make any of the hard choices that carry risk. All the risky moves were made by others and they get the blame for them not working.  Personally, I don't think Philly would be significantly better off. Despite Philly fan's consternation most of the moves over the last 3-4 years have been pretty defensible. You have to take some risks to turn a rebuilding team into a contender a lot of times those moves won't work out."
"Lol last year you were garbage, you can be better and still be a 1st or 2nd round exit(which you will be at best).  And you somehow got a lot better going from kemba walker to Dennis schroder and al horford? lollll  And the Sixers not being better this next year doesn't mean they have peaked, hard concept for you to grasp apparently.  You got worse last year, does that mean you peaked? No?  See how that works?"
"&gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping somebody in the Sixers organization got some stones.‚Äù  You me and both Chuck. Thankfully, I think Morey, Doc, and Elton have finally gained control on the organization post Coleangelo. Firing Alex Rucker and Ned Cohen after the Al Horford debacle was long overdue and I hope the regime is much more inclined to make the necessary decisions."
"Almost like our problem has consistently been shot creation in the clutch instead of ""spacing"". Good thing our FO went and got really good shot creation players over the last few years like Tobias Harris and Al Horford while alienating Jimmy Butler."
"How have you watched the league the last 4 years and not understood by now that the cap is mostly imaginary. You can move any money for any money mostly at any time unless you're wildly over the salary cap.   How many of the ""worst deals around the league"" have moved just in the last 2 or 3 offseasons? Because off the top of my head i can count John Wall, Kemba Walker, Mike Conley, Al Horford, Russell Westbrook twice, Chris Paul twice, Andrew Wiggins, Marc Gasol, Kristaps Porzingis and I'm probably forgetting a good number.  And we can say anything we want about Ben Simmons in the playoffs or about his mental fortitude, whatever. He is at worst the 40th-50th best player in the league. At worst. His athleticism, build and skillset on defense make him uniquely valuable in raising the floor of a team in a way not many guys in the league can do, and said skillset fills a lot of holes for Minnesota. And the kicker is he's coming at the lowest cost he could possibly come at. Based on current valuation I'd say Ben Simmons is the highest upside bad contract in the league. By a country mile. Acquiring Ben Simmons does more for Minnesota at this juncture then any free agent they could hypothetically sign within the next couple offseasons because they're scheduled to be past the cap til '23 anyways. So this penny pinching really overall is so needless. The Wolves need talent. Go and get talent that's available at an all time low asset cost. This isn't rocket science.  Sincerely, Dumbass"
*Brad Stevens enters the chat*   Al Horford PP and a 1st take it or leave it.
"I mean, I could argue that Ewing's 13 year stretch as a starter in which his team had ZER0 lottery appearances, only 2 first round exits, 4 conferences finals appearances, and 2 (but really 1 if you want to say he only played in 1) NBA Finals appearances is more impressive than what Dwight did as a starter.  I could argue that the Knicks being a Top 5 defensive every year of the 90s proved that he was every bit an elite defender, and the lack of all defensive teams is more a side effect of being a contemporary of Hakeem and Robinson.  I would argue that 7 All NBA teams competing with Hakeem, Robinson and early career Shaq is probably a little more impressive in context than 8 All NBA teams competing with Amar'e Stoudemire, Al Horford and very very post prime Shaq.  I could argue that despite All Star games being a flawed metric, Ewing making 11 vs Dwight's 8 shows that Ewing was a star for longer and in fact at the age Dwight was done being star, Ewing had like 7 more years of star production at the same age."
"Just never got around to changing it. Was al horford on the years before then he became a snek so it was Dennis then I just stopped caring, ill always be in Flex Gang"
He was injured from the jump.  My lasting memory of Oden will be him outplaying Al Horford and Joakim Noah in the championship game with one good hand.  Emeka Okafor is another guy who I think could've had a HoF career if not for back injuries before being drafted.  Jonny Flynn too with his hip.  There's a lot of guys that never truly got their shot.
"He's a massive waste of cap space regardless. If he's not willing to give back money then that kills Cleveland's chance of a buyout.   It would benefit the team in that you're just making the best of a bad situation - he's not there to mess with the locker room and you're clearly prioritizing the development of young guys. Once again, that's what happened to Al Horford on the Thunder. The only difference is he was a trade-able contract."
"&gt; If we want to start Rob, which is clearly the long-term goal, I think it's hard to have both Smart and Richardson in the starting lineup,  This is exactly how I feel. If you go with two mediocre shooters in the backcourt, Al basically has to start. I don't love the idea of Al starting at this point, and Schroder-Horford pick and rolls is a very nice foundation for a bench offense. If Nesmith can step up, the team starts to make a ton of sense.  Edit: Also thanks!"
"May I interest you in getting a reliable back up in Al Horford + two amazing young players (incredible upside) - Grant Williams and Romeo Langford, for Ben Simmons? Definitely a fair trade, just trust me on this."
"May I interest you in getting a reliable back up in Al Horford + two amazing young players (incredible upside) - Grant Williams and Romeo Langford, for Ben Simmons? Definitely a fair trade, just trust me on this."
"Salary-wise, plenty.  * Boston: Al Horford  * Denver: Aaron Gordon + Monte Morris  * Portland: Covington + Derrick Jones Jr.  * LAC: Bledsoe + Kennard  * etc etc.  A lot of competitive teams have 1-2 bigger contracts they'd be fine parting with.   It's just those trades + picks aren't enough to compete with what Minnesota/Sacramento/Cleveland can offer up."
Depends on Al Horford.  If he‚Äôs too old then yes. But if we had him in the bubble we would have had someone for Bam.  Plus we have actual bench depth now.
"If you‚Äôre talking about attracting stars Philly is not in that tier. We have a big population, but the 76ers aren‚Äôt bringing in any big FA and we aren‚Äôt players in the buyout market like the LA teams. Our biggest FA acquisitions this century are Elton Brand and Al Horford."
That's probably true for a bunch of those players. Poor spacing makes it easier to collapse into the paint and protect against these drives. I was still shocked to see both Tatum and Brown in the top 5 worst guys in the league though. If Al Horford is able to contribute much this year that could be a big help.
"He came at me first because he was shook so yeah lol. And it‚Äôs hilarious that the Celtics have been such a mess this past year that they provided me enough material to write an entire essay shitting on them.   I mentioned it already but it needs to be repeated because it‚Äôs hilarious and if this was the other way around we would never hear the end of LOlKniCKs BRuh LoLKniCKs: the Celtics traded a 1st rounder plus two 2nd rounders for the right to take on one of the worst contracts in basketball in Horford, only to watch Kemba and Fournier walk to the Knicks for nothing but cap space. $26,868,555 in cap space combined to be exact, which is less than the Celtics are paying washed up Al Horford by himself. Let all of sink in. Lmaooooo."
"Looks like I rattled you lol. And I rattled your soft ass without even mentioning the part where the 2012/2013 Knicks were the team that ended the KG/Pierce era of Boston Small Dicks basketball. The laughingstock Knicks were the ones who stuck the fork in you clowns after your Daddy LeBron James spanked your asses in the back to back years prior. Gotta be tough to accept that no?  Not to mention that your birth father LeBron James also went on to eliminate you clowns in 2015, 2017, and 2018. Y‚Äôall talked all that shit after your 4 stars could barely beat LeBron and Zydrunas Ilgauskas only for daddy LeBron to beat you in 5 straight playoff series over the next 8 years after that. Lmaooooo.  Also did typing that out make you feel better about trading a 1st rounder and two 2nd rounders for the right to take on Al Horford‚Äôs laughable contract only to watch Kemba and Fournier walk to the Knicks for the same amount of money combined that you fucking clowns are paying washed Horford by himself? LMAOOOOO.  And finally how hard was it for you to watch your supposed title contending team before the season end up looking up in the standings all year at a ragtag group of castoffs with the lowest payroll in basketball because Tom Thibodeau‚Äôs defensive scheme is apparently more valuable than your entire organization combined right now? Not to mention your season ended with an extremely harsh reminder that the team that you trade raped in one of the most lopsided trades in league history is somehow now your fucking daddy just a few years later. So you can add them to the list of current Boston Celtics fathers along with Lebron and the Knicks. Again, LMAOOOO.  By the way here‚Äôs a little highlight video from last year I think you‚Äôd enjoy:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wNWOthdz8yA  #FUCK THE BOSTON SMALL DICKS AND LETS GO KNICKS LMAO"
Al horford married to former Miss Universe
LBJ literally defended Al Horford multiple times versus the Hawks and Celtics
"&gt;at this time 2 years from now when the season actually starts he will be 35.  If he gets bought out this year and signs a 1-year, at the end of that contract he would be 33, if he signed another 1-year, at the end of that contract he would be 34, he would be 35 on his 3rd contract, which would be past the point of this buyout being relevant.   &gt;Al horford was credibly sent home all year  There was nothing credible about that at all. Same thing with keeping Shai out so long. That was OKC doing things to make their team worse and lose games.   OKC didn't care about sending the right message and culture, they just wanted to make their team as bad as possible to get the highest possible pick.   &gt;what makes you think dan gilbert won't want to make him shave 20 million for him to get bought out.  The fact that it's better for Cleveland to not have him there, and the fact that it would cost him more money to pay out the full contract.   &gt;And what makes you think kevin is cool losing 15 million dollars to be an end of bench guy on a contender?  The fact that he would be losing like 8.8 million at worst."
"at this time 2 years from now when the season actually starts he will be 35.   You can credibly not play the guy, Al horford was credibly sent home all year and kevin has shown he's fine with that as well. He spent 9 months on the DL with a calf strain last season.   also at no point in the last 3 years has he shown enthusiasm for playing on a losing team with young players. take a look at the 3 second violation video for the clearest example.   and you're right there are people dynamics, what makes you think dan gilbert won't want to make him shave 20 million for him to get bought out. And what makes you think kevin is cool losing 15 million dollars to be an end of bench guy on a contender?"
They added some quality depth without breaking the bank and are positioned so well with a combo of experience and youth. Al horford isnt going to be the same guy he was with his last run in boston but his court presence and high IQ will go really far with the talent they have. The schroder signing for $6mill was the steal of the off season.
"1. the cavs currently have players like isaiah hartenstein, jeremiah martin, lamar stevens, brodric thomas, dean wade, and dylan windler on the roster. Cutting one of them is completely free and wouldn't cost first rounders. (I might've made up one of those names, you wouldn't be able to tell.)  2. You are not getting assets for kevin love, you are giving up assets to give up kevin love.  3. Better fitting pieces as in other teams crap they throw in to match salary? Again look at #2 Kevin love is a negative value, you will give not get anything worthwhile.  I'd also like to add the cavs are not over the luxury tax, they are not competing this year or the next, and that sending kevin love home for the season ala Al Horford on OKC would accomplish the same thing as your hare brained scheme and not cost them picks/actual contributing players to their future."
"People said the same thing about Wall, Westbrook, Chris Paul 3 years ago, Al Horford, etc. There‚Äôs always a way to trade these guys especially when there‚Äôs only a year or two left on the deal."
"I'm just saying, it could be legit or maybe Cleveland just didn't want him around. Al Horford got sent home, Iggy never checked into Memphis."
"You're not exactly wrong, it wasn't universally loved there were a ton of threads afterwards that thought the move was stupid. The initial thread for these kind of things always has some feel-good comments, it's like Al Horford to the Sixers which was positive but a good amount of people were like wtf why"
"Clippers are better than the Knicks, sure.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Utah is better then the Heat  I ruled it as a tie, and I disagree. But, even if we roll with this, the result still doesn't change.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Mavs won both games against the Celtics last season, so no the east isn't better  The Mavericks won by 3 and 5 points respectively.  The Mavericks one key weakness was ballhandling to back up Luka. It's why they lost, Luka got gassed. They didn't fix it. They also replaced Carlisle with JASON KIDD. They did add Bullock and Sterling Brown and.... Moses Brown.  Celtics got versatile Al Horford who backs up the injury prone Williams, Bruno Fernando, Enes Kanter, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and most notably, Dennis Schroeder.  I'm takin the C's on this one. So, no, you're wrong."
I feel like Al Horford fits here
"So you‚Äôre telling me I can blame rich paul for the last few seasons of us not making the finals?   To be clear I don‚Äôt mean we‚Äôd necessarily make it every year, but I‚Äôd rather have nerlens over al horford for how much we paid him"
"KD actually wasn't the biggest free agent in 2016 as LeBron was also a free agent that summer, but after winning that championship in Cleveland just weeks earlier of course nobody thought he was going anywhere else. Other notable free agents that summer that signed max (or close to it) contracts were Al Horford, DeMar DeRozan, Bradley Beal, Mike Conley, Nicolas Batum, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard and Hassan Whiteside. That was also the infamous summer where role players got wildly overpaid. Guys like Biyombo, Mozgov, Mahinimi, Deng, Parsons, etc. [Here's a list from that summer.](https://www.businessinsider.com/31-best-nba-free-agents-2016-2016-6)"
"He's on that range where it doesn't matter, his longevity and regular season accolades hold him down  You never hear about where Kawhi is ranked all time because of that, if he had those accolades that type of shot does do a lot for a legacy   He's a 5 time all star, same as Al Horford"
"Paul likely has the defense that he was just trying to not be a part of tampering.     Looking at the timeline of the Al Horford deal (who Noel suggests the Sixers moved on to after they couldn't get ahold of Noel), my guess is Paul's defense is that the Sixers were trying to commit tampering and that Paul was just following league rules.  NBA free agency in 2019 started at 6 pm EST on 6/30.  Horford's deal was announced shortly after the start of free agency, which is already suspicious.  The Sixers would've had to try to contact and give up on Noel, before talking to and agreeing to all the terms of the deal with Horford.  That timeline would have to be really compressed for it to not be tampering.  But wait there's more!  Horford declined his $30 million player option on 6/18.  That was a shocking move at the time and rumors soon swirled that another team had agreed to a sign Horford on a large multi-year deal soon after the news of him declining his player option broke.  Before that news, everyone had assumed there was no way Horford would decline his option.  Putting everything together, it's very likely that the Horford deal was the result of tampering.  If what Noel alleges is correct, the Sixers would've had to try to contact Noel, give up, and then talk to Horford.  Those conversations likely happened before Horford decided to decline his player option, as Horford would not have walked away from a guaranteed $30 million unless he got some firm assurances that he would come out ahead.  Hence, they would have happened when teams are technically not allowed to talk to players.  So Rich Paul likely has the defense that him not returning the Sixers' calls was due to trying to follow league rules.  Furthermore, it's quite likely that the Sixers will be unwilling to provide evidence and testimony in this case, as doing so could very well open them up to a tampering investigation by the league."
"He also played on a much worse roster man. Y'all can shit on Ben Simmons,Al Horford,Tobias and JRich but KAT would have killed for that lineup (probably could have made it work due to his much much much superior shooting ability)."
"There's a very big problem with Noel's allegations at least in regards to how Paul treated the Sixers' interest.  At least in initial reporting, that seems to be the main evidence for Noel's claim.  The claim alleges that the Sixers tried to contact Noel via Rich Paul, but that Paul did not return the Sixers' call.  Because Paul did not call the Sixers back about Noel, they moved on to another target: Al Horford.  The problem is, the free agency period in question, 2019, started on June 30th at 6 pm EST.  Shortly after the start of free agency on June 30th, it was announced that the Sixers and Horford agreed to a contract.  Even worse, Horford turned down his Celtics player option by at least June 18th, which highly suggested that Horford knew there was another team that could offer him a deal he wanted.  Source: [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2841676-report-ex-celtics-star-al-horford-agrees-to-4-year-109m-contract-with-76ers](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2841676-report-ex-celtics-star-al-horford-agrees-to-4-year-109m-contract-with-76ers)  Why does that matter?  Well, teams are not supposed to be talking to players and, by extension, agents, before the start of the free agency period.  However, it seems like Horford definitely knew something was up by June 18th, and the speed at which the deal was announced on June 30th suggests that at least something was brewing before the start of the official start of free agency.  Therefore, I imagine Rich Paul's defense to be very straightforward: that he was following the NBA rules on tampering and that is why he didn't return the Sixers' calls inquiring about Noel.  And when Paul wouldn't break the rules, the Sixers moved on to Horford, whose agent was willing to let the Sixers tamper.  If so, the downside of the Sixers helping out Noel through testimony or evidence is pretty significant.  They would be openly admitting to tampering, which the league has tried to crack down on in the past few years, opening themselves up to significant liability.  I don't think this case is nearly the slam dunk that some people think it is, against Rich Paul."
"Well I mean, Rich Paul has fucked over some players now. Nerlens Noel‚Äôs agents decisions to rejected the Mavs $70 mil offer and take the qualifying is one of the worst contract decisions in nba history.  The 76ers massively overpaid for Al Horford according to most experts and they wanted Noel first, but the agent couldn‚Äôt be bothered to answer the phone?   Nobody talks about Shabaka Muhammad, but the dude only lasted in the league for a couple years, but was advised to reject $44 million? The dude ain‚Äôt even in the league anymore. That‚Äôs downright criminal of Rich Paul to turn those down.  If you‚Äôre about player empowerment, having agents screwing over players is the opposite of what you should want."
Al Horford is much better.
Al Horford was on the Sixers the bubble season. If you think that switching Horford for Nerles Noel changes anything about that season then I have a bridge to sell you.
"That's like saying if billionaires accepted bigger tax cuts the amount of money in the economy would stay the same.  Sure, but they're not going to do it.  The guys with the chance at big contracts don't want some pencil pusher getting them the deal, they want a shark who will get them Mozgov money, and Tobias Harris, and Al Horford money.  They also want someone fighting for their shoe to be one placed on display in stores, or their billboard in Times Square.  No one at that level wants to play fair, they want the biggest piece of the pie they can get, and that's why agents exist."
"Nono, they can have Al Horford back if they're that desperate for him.    I would love to keep Big Al around but if the 76ers are going to twist our arms then I guess a 1-for-1 would be fair."
True. Not-Al Horford is one of my favorite players in the league.
"Not-Al Horford might have, yeah."
"Paying a fucking shit ton load for Al Horford also hurt a contender, I recall."
"I‚Äôm all for the Rich Paul slander but this makes no logical sense.  We were looking at Noel the offseason before Horford was brought in plus the Horford signing was talked about (and leaked) before FA even began so that makes no sense.   It was known beforehand we were the team that wanted to sign Al to a $100M deal and move to him to PF which was his preferred position. Noel would‚Äôve been a backup center all the way and the Sixers didn‚Äôt want to make Horford that at all. They just had to because the fit was so bad amongst Embiid, Harris &amp; Simmons."
"Al Horford. Never really looks spectacular in the box score, but when you see all the little things he does on court (clever screens and boxing out, and quick passes), you see how good a player he is/was. He's a bit like a front court Chris Paul, in that he makes everyone around him look better."
Rockets one isnt tanking so thats in the clear They sat old al horford I guess thats the thing people are pissed about? Shai had a legit injury or else he wouldve played for team canada. And then dort rested a few games here and there if I recall. Dont really see this being any worse than toronto but for some reason people only target okc
Al Horford
"&gt; Al Horford was the best player on 2 conference finals teams. That‚Äôs not a glue guy. He‚Äôs clearly scalable into being a first option  See that‚Äôs exactly what I mean. Al Horford was the best player on that 60 win Hawks team but he was definitely not their ‚Äú1st option.‚Äù His usage rate of 22.2% was fourth highest on the team. He scored 15.2 ppg which was 3rd on the team. He averaged 3.2 assists.   He was the best player on the team while also having low usage and underwhelming counting stats. That‚Äôs why I call him a role player and a glue guy. A glue guy can still be the best player on your team. It‚Äôs a style of play, not a level of play, if that makes sense.  BTW, I never said I expect Wagner to be as good as Horford. I am saying his glue guy role can be similar in style. A guy who can be low usage and still have large impact.   Some draft guys say Wagner is the best defender in the draft. If he is legit defensively while being a low usage but still impactful guy offensively, he could be a really good player."
Yeah but Al Horford was the best player on 2 conference finals teams.  That‚Äôs not a glue guy.  He‚Äôs clearly scalable into being a first option even if you‚Äôll never win a title like that.  Glue guys are role players.  Al Horford isn‚Äôt a role player.  You can like Wagner but the hyperbole of saying he‚Äôs going to be a player like Horford is not needed.  The fact is he‚Äôs a low upside guy which is bad for a top ten pick.  Top ten picks generally speaking should be for picking guys who have all star upside unless no other all star upside guys aren‚Äôt available.  Sengun was probably the right pick at 8 because he has all star upside offensively even if he may never reach it.
"You are missing the point entirely. Glue guy is not a limit to how good you are, it is an ARCHETYPE and PLAY STYLE. I am not saying Wagner will be PJ Tucker or Beverly caliber player.   Al Horford absolutely is a glue guy. Low usage, low counting stats, large impact. That‚Äôs what a glue guy is, someone who makes everyone around him better while being low usage and not putting up huge numbers."
Dude.  Seriously stop.  Counting stats.  Al Horford is one of the best centers of the last 15 years.  Elite role players are PJ Tucker or Patrick Beverly.  People like Bruce Bowen or Derek Fisher.  Elite role players are luxuries but can still be replaced by other players who may not be able to do what they can do.  Al Horford is an All Star and a legit one.  He‚Äôs one of the most versatile defensive bigs in recent history.  He can be the hub of a conference finals team offense like with the 2018 Celtics.  Just being the best player on multiple conference finals team by definition makes him more than an elite role player.  Is Vuc an elite role player because as good as Vuc is now he was never as good as Al Horford in his prime.  Prime Al Horford was a top 25 to 30 player in the league.  Is your idea of an elite role player anybody who isn‚Äôt a top 20 player?  You realize how silly what your saying is right.  Franz Wagner will be lucky to ever be half as good as Al Horford.
I know you did not call multiple time All Star Al Horford an elite glue guy and sincerely mean it.
"Elite glue guys are extremely valuable. Look at elite role players like Al Horford, they are important players for team success. Plenty of guys in the late lotto have theoretical potential pre-draft but turn into complete busts. Drafting a high floor glue guy is not a bad pick imo"
"It would be absolutely hilarious to see Boston try and trot out current Al Horford for 25+ minutes a night in the playoffs, I really hope they do"
"right and your biggest point is that al horford isn't big enough to guard vucevic, even though horford has proven to be elite at guarding joel embiid.  i understand you're either 15 years old or just a troll so i'm just gonna stop engaging.  but that is some real mental gymnastics you gotta do.  you can just say ""Fuck the Celtics,"" people will love it."
isn't al horford one of the best players in the league at guarding joel embiid lol how much bigger do you need to be if you're already good at guarding the biggest scorer in the league?  and the celtics are big on the wing compared to most teams.  i think you're living in the kemba/IT era of the Celtics.  I'm not saying the Celtics are way better than the Bulls or that Vucevic isn't a good player that can give them problems.  but if the Celtics are a midget squad then like 90% of the NBA has midget squads.
ahh defensive stalwart enes kanter and noted ‚Äúnot undersized C‚Äôs‚Äù al horford and Rob Williams
"why is it a midget squad?  they have one of the biggest/most versatile defensive guards in the league, and their centers are AL Horford, Enes Kanter, and Robert Williams.  I feel like the only ""undersized"" player in their entire rotation is Prtichard who is 6'1""."
Celtics: PG: Kyrie Irving; Isaiah Thomas; Kemba Walker  SG: Gordon Hayward; Marcus Smart  SF: Jaylen Brown  PF: Jayson Tatum  C: Al Horford
Past: Billy Cunningham  Present: Al Horford June 3
"Charlotte at 11 is just wild, they were nearly a playoff team last year and they got better. Boston at 3 is interesting but I think the al horford pickup is a negative and nesmith and Pritchard aren‚Äôt exactly high level backups"
"of course, Timelord would be traded to the newest expansion team, the Supersonics to give Al Horford more minutes in the starting rotation."
Now you just need to find someone who wants to pay $39 million for Al Horford and Josh Richardson and you've got yourself a trade.
"Boston is not going to be any better than last year, I don't think an old as shit Al Horford nor Josh Richardson, or Schroeder do much to improve the roster.   Hopefully their health situation is better than last season, but on paper I don't think this roster is any better than a bottom half playoff team, and nowhere near a real contender.   The Sixers are also going to have a 2020 esque season this year, I think they made a legitimate mistake not trading Ben, not from a fit standpoint (though those issues exist), but just from a chemistry/locker room standpoint. Ben is one of the core issues on this roster as currently constructed, everyone knows it, and as a result I doubt Ben does not want to be there anymore, nor will many of his teammates want him there. It's going to be a shitshow that ends either with an early playoff exist, or trading Ben for literal scraps."
"we chose the Colangelos over Hinkie... and Al Horford, Tobias Harris, and Brett Brown over Jimmy Butler largely in part due to meddlesome ownership. Thats basically throwing away a championship for no reason which is hard to beat. I thought Dolan stayed in his lane on BBall decisions but i honestly dont know, kinda just thought he was a weirdo"
Give Al Horford the supermax you coward
That's a very good signing. His 3pt is very good and he is perfect in a team with al horford

"I also genuinely think Al Horford will actually surprise people and be great for them, plus Robert Williams could finally have a healthy year. Schroder is also really good for his discounted price. Celtics are being slept on imo"
"The 2008 Celtics were not overrated. They had by far the best net rating and defensive rating in the league that year. And while the series did go to 7 games, it wasn‚Äôt as close as you might think.   The Hawks record was deflated and they were better than a 37 win team by playoff time. The biggest reason for this is they traded for Mike Bibby at the trade deadline and he complemented their star player Joe Johnson well in the backcourt.  The Hawks also started a rookie Al Horford and since it was his rookie year it took him some time to get comfortable with the NBA game. By playoff time he was actually one of their most important players.   The playoff game is also different than the regular season and having a dominant iso scorer helps a lot in the playoffs which is exactly what the Hawks had in Iso Joe. Joe got crazy hot from (especially considering the era) in that playoff series and was able to push it to 7 games. But if you look at the actual scores from the games, the Celtics destroyed the Hawks in their wins and the Hawks barely beat the Celtics for their wins.   Just look at game 7 which the Celtics won by like 40 points."
"LeBron‚Äôs teammates showed up for the Raptors, if they‚Äôd played like that the whole time it wouldn‚Äôt have been a carry job at all despite the fact it was his best series individually. The Celtics had Kyrie most of the season, but tell me more about how a team whose best player was either Al Horford or a rookie Jayson Tatum was anything resembling a competitive conference finals opponent in a year that isn‚Äôt absolute ass. Pacers were decent. A lot of teams are decent. Could surround LeBron with the 14 worst players in the league and he should still be beating them, because he‚Äôs LeBron and ‚Äúdecent‚Äù teams don‚Äôt have any business in the Finals either. Which is my whole point."
"He still got by more talented teams. Let‚Äôs be real, LeBron had no all star caliber teammates. Love was past his prime at this point. The Raptors won 59 games this year and had an elite backcourt &amp; LeBron swept them. The Celtics were a more talented team with young studs like Tatum, Brown, Rozier and Al Horford. Yet again, LeBron single handidly dismantled them. He even nearly won a game against the KD Warriors with 50 in game 1 but JR ruined it. It‚Äôs one of the most impressive carry jobs in league history hands down."
"&gt; the 3 years he was GM they had zero success on the court.  By design. Embiid didn‚Äôt get to play yet under Hinkie. Then they got Simmons that summer. They hit on 2 of the 6 lotto picks or whatever it was. That‚Äôs what Hinkie‚Äôs plan was. Then Colangelo and then Brand went and traded for Tobias Harris, traded up for Fultz, let Butler go, and signed Al Horford.  Can‚Äôt be too sure what Hinkie would have done if given the chance but it couldn‚Äôt have been any worse that‚Äôs for sure"
WTF? The Sixers are consistently contenders despite the following  1. Lit up #1 overall pick on fire  2. Traded multiple 1sts for Tobias Harris.   3. Let go of Jimmy Butler to sign Al Horford  4. Ben Simmons deciding not to ever improve his offense.  Even with all those blunders if even one of those things turned out differently they probably would've already made a finals if not the championship already. Imagine this team with Tatum or Butler the past two years.
"This is confirmation bias, no? The most common lineup in 2020/21 with Simmons and without Embiid + Thybulle had no real center (Simmons, Curry, Green, Harris, Scott) and in 2019/20 the most common lineup w Simmons and without Embiid + Thybulle had the Sixers playing a washed Al Horford at center. Isn‚Äôt it kinda obvious that a team with no real center is going to perform way worse than a team with a DPOY-level center and an all-defensive guard? Because when you compare the Sixers when they play Embiid with only Simmons and Embiid with only Thybulle, they play better defensively with the Embiid + Simmons combo."
"Despite all our draft fuck ups all we needed to do was run it back w/ Jimmy after the 2019 loss to the Raptors and get a decent backup center. In hindsight, maybe trade Ben at that point for a third star. Too bad we fucking blew it on Al Horford and Tobias"
"So he bags him when the narrative suits the haters but his comments aren't really bagging him also when it suits the haters?            Whatever, you still haven't cottoned onto the fact that everything Embiid said in his latest comments were straight up lies. Horford was brought in solely as insurance for Embiid's own injury issues and because Big Al absolutely dominated him in past playoffs, taking that out of the equation was seen as a positive. It had nothing to do with Ben. And as for Butler, well I've already said that Jimmy himself has had nothing negative to say about Simmons. Everything that has come directly out of Jimmy's mouth hasn't alluded to any friction between them. But go ahead and take second hand accounts as gospel if that makes it easier for you to run with the 'Ben bad' narrative.            And yes, I support Australians in the NBA, so what? I've also aired my fair share of criticism towards Ben and his lack of development, and moreso his attitude towards his NBA career in general. I just take issue with all these garbage reports that are so obviously untrue and can be easily fact checked but people are just too damn lazy to do it and just run with the narrative. If that makes you upset I don't really give a crap."
thats a lie. they traded jimmy bc they gave tobias the max and jimmy wouldnt sign for al horford money. jimmy only handled the ball in the clutch. all game it was ben.  it was tobias over jimmy.   and they never built around ben or they wouldnt have signed another center to clog the lane in horford.  horford was explicitly embiid insurance bc if his injuries and bodyweight issues that led to him missing several playoff games the year before  they were done w him post playoffs. they left him alone vs media all offseason after downing him. but now that they cant get what they want they want to love him up and say hes so vital and they always wanted him to stay.  yall just need to stop lying. its embarrassing
"Embiid made statements to the contrary on Thursday, telling media members the Sixers‚Äô decision to let Butler leave in a sign-and-trade to the Heat and then sign Al Horford for the 2019-20 season was a mistake. Embiid said the decision was made ‚Äújust to make sure that [Simmons] needs the ball in his hands.‚Äù  Butler went on to have an All-Star campaign in 2019-20 and led the Heat to the NBA Finals in his first season in Miami.  ‚ÄúWhat Ben can‚Äôt be responsible for is the Sixers‚Äô decision to move on from Jimmy,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúNo matter what anybody said.  ‚ÄúThis is what the team chose to do. So now when Jimmy goes to the Finals, that‚Äôs eggs on your face. That‚Äôs not Ben‚Äôs fault.‚Äù Ben Simmons (25) shoots as Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert (27) defends in the second half during an NBA basketball game on Feb. 15, 2021. Ben Simmons (25) shoots as Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert (27) defends in the second half during an NBA basketball game on Feb. 15, 2021.Rick Bowmer / AP Showing his worth  To be fair, Embiid is the better player and harder for opponents to scheme against. Simmons is also tougher to build a team around because of his offensive shortcomings. For him to be successful, he has to be surrounded with an army of shooters and a secondary ballhandler.  Yet Simmons still managed to make an important impact with the Sixers.‚ÄùWhen Joel has not been durable, Ben‚Äôs been durable,‚Äù one source said of Embiid also missing time to injuries. ‚ÄúNo offense to Joel, he deserves to have the team built around him. They made their bet around Joel, which is fine. He deserves that.‚ÄùBut Simmons has had some of his best games on nights when Embiid has been sidelined.  A prime example was his career-high 42 points to go with 12 assists and nine rebounds while playing center in a 132-124 road loss to the Utah Jazz on Feb. 15. Simmons even made 12 of 13 free throws.Back on Jan. 20, 2020, he had 34 points, 12 assists, 12 rebounds, five steals, and two blocks to lead the Embiid-less Sixers to a 117-111 road victory over the Brooklyn Nets. He made 12 of 14 shots and went 10 of 14 from the foul line while playing multiple positions.  And a source pointed out that Simmons led the Sixers to their final eight victories of the 2017-18 season with Embiid sidelined with a concussion and fracture to the orbital bone near his left eye.  ‚ÄùThey won those games with Marco Belinelli and J.J. Redick,‚Äù the source said of Simmons‚Äô teammates during the winning streak. ‚ÄúNot James Harden. Not Kevin Durant and Kyrie, LeBron [James] and A.D. [Davis]. It was Marco Belinelli and J.J. Redick only to come back to the same style of play when Embiid returned for the postseason.‚Äù Being shopped for James Harden  The 2020-21 NBA season was the most difficult for Simmons, a source says.  Before the season, Simmons thought he would be traded for Harden.  In fact, he was so sure he would be dealt  that he went house shopping in Houston. A source said the Simmons camp was even informed by someone in the team that he more than likely would be moved.  ‚ÄúWe realized this move was a result of putting all the eggs in Embiid‚Äôs basket,‚Äù one source said.  In Harden, the Sixers would have gotten someone to pair with Embiid such as when they had Jimmy Butler, but better. Harden finishes isolation plays by taking opponents off the dribble or burying step-back three-pointers. The Sixers needed someone to strike fear in defenders while making things easier for Embiid.  It didn‚Äôt take long for reports to leak that the Sixers were interested in acquiring Harden via a trade for Simmons.  At the time there were reports that Harden‚Äôs close friend, Meek Mill, wanted him to play in Philly. Harden and Meek Mill both have a relationship with Sixers minority owner Michael Rubin.  Morey developed a lasting relationship with Harden as Rockets general manager before joining the Sixers. The 2018 MVP, however, got his wish and was traded to the Nets.  Sources believe that Morey was never fully comfortable with Simmons at point guard. A team official refuted the notion that Morey didn‚Äôt like Simmons‚Äô game. But other sources said Simmons noticed how Morey reacted during games when displeased with something the player did.  Simmons remained committed to the Sixers throughout the season. He had an ally in coach Doc Rivers, who went to great lengths to defend Simmons in the media. However, folks close to Simmons believe Rivers and Embiid threw him under the bus following the Game 7 loss to the Hawks. Sixers coach Doc Rivers says he wants Ben Simmons back on the team this season. Sixers coach Doc Rivers says he wants Ben Simmons back on the team this season. Elizabeth Robertson / MCT Time to move on  After the series with Atlanta, Simmons informed Paul that he wanted a change of scenery. Paul then told Morey two days later. Then the agent informed Sixers brass in person during a private meeting at the NBA draft combine in Chicago of Simmons‚Äô intent.  In that meeting, a source said Paul told the Sixers that arming them with ample time to find a deal was Simmons‚Äô wish. The source added Paul wasn‚Äôt demanding or threatening anything, simply informing them of Simmons‚Äô decision. Paul told the team administrators to stop asking Simmons to be something he‚Äôs not and focus on what he‚Äôs telling them.  Paul told them, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs telling you that ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not coming to Philadelphia. My time as a 76er is done.‚Äô‚Äù  ¬ª READ MORE: Joel Embiid will be expected to do more on defense for the Sixers without Ben Simmons  The Sixers asked why Simmons wanted out, and Paul informed them that the point guard was mentally exhausted. The source believes they didn‚Äôt pay attention to Simmons‚Äô state of mind or feelings about being in Philly because of the four years remaining on his contract.  ‚ÄúThe icing on the cake came when Ben told the Sixers brass face-to-face during their August meeting in Los Angeles,‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have anything personal against Embiid. He also appreciated managing partner Josh Harris, co-managing partner David Blitzer and the organization and what they‚Äôve done. But at the same time, it‚Äôs run its course.‚Äù  Now even if he does come back to Philadelphia, Simmons still doesn‚Äôt intend to play a game.  ‚ÄúYou are never getting the same player back in Philly,‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúYou definitely are not getting him back in uniform. Even if he was in uniform, you are not getting back the same player.‚Äù  A source added that when a player is motivated to come back after defeat, they come back and you just know how motivated they are. Teams don‚Äôt need to convince them to return.  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to ask and go searching,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúAnd when they don‚Äôt want to be somewhere, they tell you it ain‚Äôt going to work.‚Äù  Well, Simmons is speaking loud and clear."
that was some hinkie bullshit for the league forcing them to play someone they didnt want to.  Meanwhile OKC is sitting Al Horford for the whole season just because.  Let the teams do what they want and we wont have problems
"I mean I'm sure the difference is Horford didn't complain and AD did. I just think it was wild that OKC sat Horford to try and lose games because it would be beneficial to the team and that was fine, while the Pelicans sat AD so he wouldn't get hurt because him getting hurt would be detrimental to the team and that was somehow a problem.  I suppose it's also an issue of popularity. As much as I love the guy, nobody buys tickets to go see Al Horford play. They do for AD."
Meanwhile OKC just got to DNP:Old Al Horford. Shit was mad hypocritical
"Lol you don‚Äôt give a 109 million dollar contract to a backup. You can‚Äôt possibly think that was ever the real plan for Horford. He was supposed to play with Embiid just as much as he was supposed to back him up.  Our backup centers sucked but that is not the only reason, or even the main reason, why we suck with Embiid off the floor. Nothing changed with Al or Dwight. We still suck with Jo off the floor. The biggest reason for that is horrible rotations. Brett had some bad rotations but I think a lot of it was personnel. Doc has even worse rotations. Doc played Ben or Tobi with 4 bench guys and even a whole bench unit in the playoffs real minutes for fuck‚Äôs sake. It‚Äôs pure incompetence."
Al Horford.
"I was like "" Al? Allen Iverson? No,that can't be right, oh He means Horford."""
I kept asking why they signed Horford and I never got an answer that made any sense. It always some combo of a) Al guards Embiid well b) this weaken the celtics c) just in case Embiid gets hurt.
I was confused too. Al Horford....
Al Horford.
As someone who doesn't hate or love Simmons this is how I see it.  Simmons single handedly made the org pay 34 year old Al Horford 100M/4Y? Really?
butler himiself came out and said he lost faith in brown and the organization and wanted out.  that and the FO offered tobias more than him.  just terrible management Morey made a small miracle in turning al horford into something that fits
"Jimmy himself was blantant and said he didn't want to stay, they had no leadership in the coach.    It was a terrible move to give up two good valuable pieces and then go all in on Harris and that al horford was the fall back option after such."
"true, but it would've hardly made a differene. Al horford was a terrible fit, but relying on noel for that role would be even worse. He'd be absolutely great off the bench, but thats not comparable to Al horford money or can't exchange one or the other.   Nonetheless, Brand dropped the ball. Hilarious Minnesota wants him apparently, Twolves are gonna Twolve."
What is it with Philly team and signing players just so their rivals don‚Äôt have them..  Demarco Murray.. al Horford shit I guess technically Bryce Harper
"&gt;the reason we signed al horford    They signed horford because embiid is injury prone and the front office vastly overpaid crippling their cap for a year.  Kinda revisionist history to claim they signed him for Simmons sake, and it glosses over the horrible overpay which wasn‚Äôt Simmons fault"

Think he's talking about the Al Horford Sixers
"Does Embiid count? If not Brook Lopez, Al Horford, or Marc Gasol, if I understand your definition of stretch 5 properly"
"I drafted both KD and Al Horford to the Wizards in NBA Live '08 when I was a kid, and the starting five of those 2, Arenas, Caron Butler and Antawn Jamison went 82-0. Does that make you happy?"
"He's a good all around offensive player who is very efficient, excellent passing center who can work as the hub of a good offense, very good rebounder, acceptable defender. I think he has the type of game that looks better on a good team too, which means if/when the Pacers get some more pieces he's only going to look better.  I don't think he's a #1 guy at the moment (or probably ever) but he's an excellent #2 in the vein of like Chris Webber or Al Horford."
"Please don‚Äôt pretend you‚Äôre interested in a rational argument. You believe that the players should be grilled about their medical info by media. That isn‚Äôt rational.  I never said it‚Äôs only their business, but it‚Äôs certainly not the business of the media or the fans. The fans are going to know by the time the season starts anyways because the team will make a statement or the player is clearly going to be absent from the games.  It‚Äôs certainly not fun as a fan to have a player you like sit out and potentially hurt the team, but I didn‚Äôt see Thunder media or fans on a witch-hunt to ask why Al Horford wasn‚Äôt playing last year when they obviously just rested him for the season to lose games. The fans didn‚Äôt get to watch him play. Did that not have implications for the team‚Äôs record? You only care about this now because it‚Äôs convenient for your own lazy argument."
Yeah you‚Äôre interested in Al Horford? :-)
The Sixers' backup point guards in this span were Raul Neto and a rookie Tyrese Maxey. Their backup centers were Al Horford and Dwight Howard.
Philly had no use for Al fucking Horford either and they gave him a bag in free agency.  Doc Rivers would probably trot out a Maxey/Green/Harris/Sabonis/Embiid lineup and think he was smart for doing so.
Must still be mad he had to watch Al Horford last season
"I live in a city with no professional sports but ok bud.   You also could have signed Jimmy butler but your team fucked that up, congrats on maxing Tobias Harris and al horford and Ben Simmons though.   Yalls front office clearly sucks, maybe that‚Äôs why the good players don‚Äôt care to meet/sign with yall?"
I'm sure their fans will lose sleep over missing the opportunity to sign Al Horford in FA
"Philly fans are brutal sometimes.  Remember when they gave Al Horford and his sister(?) death threats just because of the mistake the FO made? As if him getting a massive contract was a slight directed towards them.  In this situation, however, they're (mostly) in the right. Simmons has to grow up and put some work in eventually, and wanting out as a result of your inaction is pretty immature."

Simmons and Embiid is a great duo. They just totally fucked up the rest of the roster.   They were a crazy bounce in game 7 away from going to OT with the eventual champions with Butler. Then for some unknown reason they spent tons of money on Al Horford and Tobias Harris. Imagine if they stayed patient and flexible and traded for Harden last season instead‚Ä¶
"You can't really believe holding onto a player on a 4 year contract is going to reflect poorly on our front office and organization? We're not holding Simmons back, the market for him sucks and we don't want to actively make our team worse. The player does not determine where they play, if we want to hold onto him we can. It's not even a Harden situation where he can walk for free, he's literally 1 year into the max he signed lol what are you talking about?  1. We never attract free agents anyway. The ones we do are overpays like JJ Redick and Al Horford, we aquire good players through trades I'm really not worried about our ability to sign a backup C or PG being affected by this.  2. I've got no problem with Paul doing what is in the best interest of his client, but you're talking as if we're forcing an injured player to play or something. Paul already has a bad relationship with us because he wouldn't return our phone calls for Nerlen Noel and now he's being sued for it. Maxey is going into his second year so we have to have a relationship with them for a while anyway.  You seem to be confusing fan animosity with friction between the two parties. Ben and Rich Paul met with our management multiple times this summer. The idea that he's ""ghosted"" anyone in the organization has been proven wrong by our players themselves. What exactly have we done that you think is so egregious lol? We've tried to trade him and have determined that the value just isn't there so we're asking him to show up and play..."
"I can‚Äôt find the original article, but there is an article from the Athletics saying that after a long debate, everyone on Sixers FO were on board on bringing Jimmy back and Jimmy would consider taking the max offer from the Sixers. However, Al Horford suddenly became available and the team decided that Al is great for this team‚Ä¶."
"Not Tobias Harris, old ass Al Horford to a max contract lmfao"
Al Horford Langford two firsts
"Jimmy was electric before he hurt his wrist. Then he got hurt, but adapted his game so well and was our de facto closer to end the year. I‚Äôm still fuming that our front office decided fucking Al Horford was more useful to us than one of the best clutch performers in the league‚Ä¶on a team desperate for shot creation and crunch-time offense."
"Yet they licked their chops at Al ""Embiid Stoppa' Horford and Tobias ""Inconsistent"" Harris."
Including Al Horford to Philadelphia
Al Horford to Philly lmao
Celtics receive: Ben Simmons  6ers receive: Al Horford + Josh Richardson + FRP  Who says no?
Any Philly fans want an Al Horford reunion?   We'll chuck in some picks too.
"I'm willing to trade Al Horford and filler. You interested, Philly?"
Facts! Bust Kevin Durant at 2 before superstar Al Horford at 3
"&gt;know better than the elite experts  ""Know better than the elite experts"" LMAO look at what you're typing. You 12?   1. Who are the ""elite experts""? 2. What do I know better than the ""elite experts""  &gt;Yikes...didn't realize I hit so close to home with that one.  Dude, your franchise and Luka are irrelevant. I have more thoughts or feelings about dunno, Al Horford, than I do for Luka. Different conference, never played the Bucks in a game that matters, has never even won a playoff series. You probably think Luka and the Mavericks are more important than they actually are. Stop, it's embarrassing to actually suggest I have reasons to shit talk Luka as a Bucks fan other than the stats themselves.  &gt;Which is why you tried to use Giannis' highly positive on-off as an argument for Luka's negative on-off  That was a reply to your argument (which other Mavs fans also made) that the Mavericks don't have good players around him. Well guess what, you're now 8-4 and Luka still has an atrocious On-Off. I used Giannis as an example of another superstar who has a terrible team around him (because the Bucks are literally missing 3 or 4 starters in almost every game) and showed you he still has a VERY positive On-Off, as do most superstars in the league really.  Don't be mad. Luka ain't paying you to defend him on reddit anytime soon. Chill and enjoy another year without a postseason series win while you act like people are jealous or mad at  your mediocre franchise and your Can't-Win-A-Series superstar."
"Lol, I'm enjoying the Al Horford-George Hill match-up."
the celtics have Al Horford which is not the most dominant big man. run them off the court
"I genuinely believe that Simmons should just stop training or put in minimal effort such that he's unplayable, and retire at the end of his contract. He'll basically become a John Wall/AL Horford type contract except he can just choose to stop trying, lose some fitness, and retire. After this season of sitting out the whole year, he will have basically no trade value anyway.    $200mil in lifetime earnings is plenty enough, and you're clearly not a competitive guy. Just go live in LA like you've always wanted in Hidden Hills and enjoy investments and retirement."
He‚Äôs on the super Al Horford program. Will turn some heads in two years after staying healthy.
Al Horford wasn‚Äôt a max. And obviously it ended up terribly. But the point was he was acquired because he was their attempt at building around Simmons. Simmons played better with Horford than Embiid anyway that year
Al Horford
&gt; I'm talking a back up stretch 5 allowing Ben to play with the bench unit ( which he hasn't done since his rookie season)  Also that was literally the point of Al Horford who shot 4.6 3s on 36% the year before he came
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/sixers/joel-embiid-ben-simmons-holdout-sixers-nba-training-camp%3famp  ‚ÄúI feel like I can really play with anybody and I  can make anybody be better on the court. I don‚Äôt necessarily need shooters. But I feel like over the years ‚Äî like you look at when we got Al (Horford), it‚Äôs because we needed a stretch five, just to make sure that was for him. And most of my career I‚Äôve had to kind of step out to the three-point line quite a bit‚Äù ‚Äî Joel Embiid  I mean if you don‚Äôt wanna take my word for it, here‚Äôs Joel‚Äôs so idk what you‚Äôre trying to argue. I completely disagree with the notion that a 40% shooter in Tobias is taking away from the spacing required for Ben to drive.   Ben‚Äôs issues are his own, the sixers have put talent around him and he hasn‚Äôt expounded on his game since he entered the league."
"Yeah that‚Äôs kind of where my thinking is as well. He worked well with Horford for many reasons, and it‚Äôs kind of a shame Al would be 2 years older by now. Which I think also inhibits the logic of this trade. Once Al starts getting close to retirement or taking a full time bench role the fit makes less sense, that‚Äôs the type of big you‚Äôd need to make it all work.   I honestly don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd lose A TON if it were a trade for Jaylen, I think it‚Äôs more of a lateral move which doesn‚Äôt get them closer in any impactful way. Just a different team construction. The Jays with Ben would be awesome, for obvious reasons."
"&gt; Simmons would fit awfully on a Celtics team with minimal shot creation and two big men  Big disagree. For what he brings defensively in their switch heavy scheme, and what he contributes offensively in terms of ball movement and tempo I think it would be great. The atmosphere would suck and it would probably be a failed experiment but he played his best basketball next to Al Horford and brings a ton for the weaknesses of the Celtics.  Last year when he was out you could see we struggled massively on offense. He's great at setting the tempo, directing play, and would inject some non ISO Ball into their offense. It would crumble in the second round of the playoffs but until then I actually think he'd be great there."
Reminder that NBA media acted like OKC and Sam Presti killed a family of 5 for sitting Al Horford after he played half a season.
"35, just ask Al Horford."
"Thank you, I keep getting replies that he's 6'8"" as well, ignoring the fact that he traditionally plays centre and he has a massive wingspan. AND Celtics also have Al Horford"
"Al Horford has been way better so far than any 10 game stretch that Kemba had for us last season.  Brown has been injured and Tatum has been shooting like dog water, but if we're just talking about Kemba, we've been better off by not having him."
I hate Al Horford because of that series
"If al has millions of fans, i'm one of them. if al has 10 fans, i'm one of them. if al has no fans, that means i'm not on earth anymore. if the world is against al horford, then i'm against the world"
"&gt;Dwight is easily more ***individually*** accomplished than half the players included on the 75 list  The key thing there is 'individually.'   Basketball is a team sport.   Again, I want to stress, I think Dwight *is* deserving, but it's hard for me think Ewing and Parish shouldn't be on that list.   I mean, Ewing was the centerpiece for the Mecca of basketball for the better part of two decades. He was the biggest challenger to Jordan, and likely would have had one or two FMVP if not for the Bulls and some questionable officiating.   He was clearly a much better scorer. As for defense, he was GREAT. It is easy to down play his defense because he played in the greatest era of defensive centers (Hakeem, Robinson, Kareem, Mourning, Mutumbo, Eaton). But Ewing was swatting away 3-4 bpg in his prime.   And he was epically better on the offensive end. He was likely just as good a rebounder to, he just happened to play on a great rebounding team (Oakley, Mason, etc.).   Parish... he is such a grossly underrated and underappreicated talent.   Without him, the Celtics wouldn't have won a single title in the 80s. He was a stellar defender and diverse and highly efficient offensive player. And, given that basketball is a team sport, and he has four rings, that's something to consider, as is his 9 All-Star teams. Again, Parish played in an era that was DEEP at the center spot. Were Dwight competing for All-NBA team selections against Kareem, Ewing, Moses, and Hakeem instead of Al Jefferson, Al Horford, Andrew Bynum, Marc Gason, and Andrew Bogut, you can rest assured that he'd likely have as many All-NBA team selections as Parish.   Mourning... I hate the dude, but he was easily a superior defender to Dwight.  He was just as athletic (or nearly) and he was far more cerebral. He had a much higher BBIQ.  I might see a case for Dwight over Mourning given Mourning's shortened career, but I think a lot of people also see that as a narrative that strengthens Mourning's case.   &amp;#x200B;  At any rate... Dwight is fucking incredible. I almost feel like the league ought to have gone a different route with the list, honouring the original 50 and adding 75 more perhaps?   But great talents would have been left off either way.   Dwight's a HOFer, that's clear. And I think that matter more."
"Ima say Al Horford.   I think similar to Horford, all the people saying OBJ is washed are going to realize how good he still is when he gets to his next team.   His advanced metric are all still insane. He is getting open at an elite level still, his problems are the QB."
"surprisingly you have to put Al Horford in this conversation too. He was averaging 3 blocks a game, a steal and a half a game, is guarding every position pretty effectively. Might fuck around and make the all Defensive team this year."
"We had Chris Paul, AD, and Jrue for years. Eventually most players will leave, so those were bad examples.  Randle signed a 1 year deal there to replace Boogie and we let him walk when we knew we were picking Zion, because they play the same position and neither can effectively play another one. Another bad example.  Christian Wood Barry played with us, and we waived him. Another bad example.  Pelicans could‚Äôve brought Lonzo back if they wanted to, but decided to sign and trade him instead. That was the Pelicans decision, not Lonzo‚Äôs, so another bad example.  We literally extended JV before the season so that doesn‚Äôt even make sense.  Zion has lots of years left, and the Pelicans may want to trade Zion before Zion even wants to be traded with the way things are looking.  BI said he wants to be here and is behaving that way, plus he has multiple years left on his deal.  I could say Philly is a farm team because AI, Barkley, Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, and JJ Redick all left.  Also, Ben Simmons is about to leave.  Also, Joel Ennius will force us way out after you fail  to put enough talent around him and get eliminated early in the playoffs again.  Tobias Harris will probably want out after that too.  Let‚Äôs just play it safe and say Tyrese Maxey will want out after that as well.  How did that post even get this many upvotes? ü§¶"
"I mean the 76ers aren‚Äôt particularly great at retaining talent either. Off the top of my head.   Andre Igoudala, Nikola Vucevic, Jrue Holiday, Jimmy Butler, Mikal Bridges, Al Horford, Ben Simmons (soon)  None of these guys are as criminal as AD and CP3, but you can conceivably make a deep playoff run with these guys alone."
and al horford

Wait until you see who we got for Al Horford
"It doesn‚Äôt matter that Curry is the best player when Boston gives up significantly more value. GSW still has Klay, Kuminga, Wisemen, Wiggins etc. they have a solid roster and with Tatum/Brown they‚Äôre stacked for years. Boston‚Äôs next best players are Marcus Smart and Al Horford, how the hell are Curry and Draymond coming there to win a chip before they start declining?"
Knick fans are rejoicing the Celtics trading for Al Horford
Sounds good. I‚Äôll call Daryl Morey and have him trade Simmons for Marcus Smart and Al Horford
Yes and I‚Äôm saying they would play inefficiently together.  Just like 5 Allen iversons on the same team would play inefficiently with each other.  Think al horford + embiid but better.
"if the Bill Simmons phone call was true, then Stevens is the bigger idiot there, not Morey.   BS: ""Hi, what's up with Ben?""  DM: ""Not much, who do you have to offer?""  BS: ""I can do Marcus Smart and Al 'Batross' Horford""   DM: ..."
Could you imagine if they traded away jaylen and ended up with al horford and Ben Simmons? I‚Äôm dying just thinking about it lol
Al Horford has been training his flinch muscles to save him from that.
I forgot to mention Lonzo and al Horford
Al Horford is an elite defender.
He got the Al Horford in OKC treatment. They have an agreement for him to not play and look for a trade instead.
Al horford for Ben Simmons and 2 protected firsts.   Who says no?
Al Horford the first man with Alzheimer's to play in the NBA
Al Horford
Al Horford: All of this trouble‚Ä¶. And where did it lead you? Right back to me‚Ä¶..
"Empty stats in a 49-33 team while still sporting a 4.8 VORP? The team went to 7 against a Celtics team who had IT and Al Horford play out of their minds, and he averaged 30/10 in the first round and 25/10 in the second round. How can you be the best player on a really good team and put up empty stats?  I can tell you how to feel on the gang signs (it‚Äôs kinda the reality when you being a guy who grew up in the hood to the nba) but his level of play was undeniably elite. [Just](utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) take a look at a [a couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/69y3cn/barkley_john_wall_is_the_best_point_guard_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) posts around that time. Guy was pretty unanimously considered a top player in the east. Hindsight is always 20/20.  Maybe his dollar figure was a little high, but if he was still elite no one would care that he‚Äôs getting 5 million more then he should"
Would you trade al horford?
Y‚Äôall want Al Horford again?
May I interest you in a slightly use Al Horford?
"Such as?  Al Horford?  Josh Richardson?  Been there done that with both, definitely not.   Brown and Tatum are the only guys Celtics have worth positive trade value (Maybe Robert Williams but Sixers don't need a 5, Smart can't be traded until January)."
"Eh, I mean Al Horford may be washed and Aaron Nesmith may be a bust but given larger sample sizes both are most definitely going to be better 3 point shooters than Simmons.  Simmons has actually managed to have Marcus Smart type efficiency from the arc the last 2 years on paper (.300 and .286) but that's on 17 attempts and with, I'm guessing, no one within 8 feet of him for almost all of those shots. He has still never hit a playoff 3, he's famously averse to effectively taking coaching on his 3 point shooting, and is famously afraid to shoot.  Moreover it's not just 3s. Last year Simmons only took 15 shots from further than 14 feet out. From 10-14 feet he was 11/37 for a 29.7% FG%. His spacing issues aren't just a matter of his limitations at the arc, he's just not much of a threat to shoot until he gets within 10 feet. That's a huge problem for Smart, but it's an even bigger problem for a star player you try to build your team around.  Al Horford's taken 40 shots from &gt;14 feet out *this* season. Last year he shot 50% from 10-14 feet on 28 attempts and 43.8% from 15-19 feet on 32 attempts.  And, of course, Simmons is a star player who's on the ball a lot so his shooting limitations represent a particularly big impact.  Importantly I think the book on how to make use of Simmons is pretty clear: ideally you'd surround him with guys who can shoot making it easy to open up the lane and maximizing the spacing you can get with him on the floor. The Celtics, um, can't do that, especially if they're shipping out Brown.  The team that trades for Simmons should be a team that's particularly good at shooting the 3, not particularly bad at it."
The same Embiid who took way more perimeter shots than he should to accommodate space for Ben Simmoms.  Embiid is a great shooter from the perimeter even though he shouldn't take those shots.  Tatum and Ben while good on defense is really bad on offense for how Boston wants to play.  They want rim running bigs or the AL Horford elbow type.  Ben Simmons is neither.  Simmons is a play initator and not a real play finisher.  I'd love for him to be someone who run a bunch of pick and rolls but on Boston that ain't happening they don't have those types of guards.  So then what you put the ball in Ben's  hand and run an ineffective pick and roll with him and Robert Williams.  I don't see.the fit.
"Could you imagine a defense with Joel Embiid, Al Horford, and Josh Richardson? No one would be able to score on them!"
"We have Al Horford, I think he's the perfect fit next to Embiid. Josh Richardson could help the Sixers depth as well."
"There are actually so many, I had no idea. Other than the ones you listed, JJJ, Domantis Sabonis, Ed Davis, Al Horford, with Jerami Grant and Jae Crowder as small ball options."
"He's averaging 2 more contested shots than Poeltl in 5 more minutes per game.  Al Horford is averaging the same 3 point contests and 3 less 2 point contests per game in 29 mins a game.  Isaiah Stewart is averaging 1 less 2 point contest in 12 less minute per game.  People need to stop using this stats as a some great, dominant defensive metric."
"2017-2018 Celtics against Warriors in the finals would have been awesome. If we faced them with Kyrie and Hayward I legitimately think we could have taken them to 7, we had been matching up really well with them that season and their 73 win season.   But if we faced them injured, would still be insane to see a team with Al Horford as the best player make the finals and see rookie Jayson Tatum and sophomore Jaylen Brown going up against Golden State."
Al Horford. He‚Äôs taking the mid-life leap
Idk on one side the hornets desperately need defense on the other end we already have enough bad contracts. Terry rozier and mason plumlee for al horford and marcus smart.  edit: Nvm forgot we cant trade terry yet
"are you trying to say that al horford, king of the three from the top of the key, the prodigal papa, the dominican daddy, is not a superstar??"
Al Horford looking young
"I do the Al Horford flinch every time I cross one of my roommates paths (who I don‚Äôt know well). He laughs a little but I think he honestly thinks I‚Äôm jumpy (I pretend I don‚Äôt see/hear him coming, then I flinch when he‚Äôs insight lol)"
*Al Horford flinch*
nah the best one is the average sized white guy in a suit on the bench who does a full body al horford flinch lmao
"Okay ben is being a cunt but this is fucking ridiculous lmao. Blake griffen, mike conley, john wall, demar derozan, al horford do you know how many max contracts have been given out for the player to not win jack shit and be a ghost when it matters."
"How are they blatantly tanking this season? Would love to hear your rationale.  Last season they *clearly* were, as they shut down a healthy Al Horford for no reason. This year they are out there trying to win, but are simply outmatched by most teams due to talent and experience. In other words, they're *bad*, not tanking. If they were randomly shutting down healthy, talented players they would be tanking."
"Al Horford is 6'9"" and 35 years old and is doing a better job this season. I don't see old as an excuse but you're right they are old."
Al Horford is the best player in the league who‚Äôs over 30

Imagine the difference between having Al Horford as your center and team leader and fucking Tristan Thompson.
"To be fair, I don't even remember prime Al Horford doing that."
"What makes Al genuinely special offensively is his screen setting. Not only does he set good screens but everything else he does kind of comes from screens as well.     Ideally, he should have the ball in his hands and he should be setting a screen for someone. His skill set and decision-making in those situations is so elite.   * His best passes are off screens  * His best drives are off screens  * His best jump shots are off screens  * His best off-ball spacing comes from how his screens      During his first Boston stint he had guys like Isaiah Thomas and Kyrie Irving who he could set screens for and then make plays out of those screens.   * Sometimes he screens and rolls to the rim * Sometimes he screens and pretends to roll to the rim but then seals a defender to open up a driving lane * Sometimes he screens but instead of rolling he pops out at the FT or 3P line * Sometimes he slips the screen and spaces out to the perimeter to pull the big man out of the paint * Sometimes he fakes the handoff and drives to the rim * Sometimes he fakes the handoff and swings the ball around to someone else * Sometimes he fakes the handoff and then throws an entry pass to the now cutting guard who he just faked the handoff with * etc etc.  The possibilities are endless and it makes him so effective because you never know what he's going to do and he reads and reacts so well that he can kind of make it up as he goes.   Then he goes to Philadelphia where neither Ben or Joel use screens and Brett Brown's system didn't really use them either. Harris is a nice PnR scorer but it took the 76ers a while (and a coaching change) to figure that out.  You're right, Al is super plug-and-playable, but he ended up on the one team in the league that didn't really value his screen setting.   They tried to play him off-ball and that's kind of missing the point.  Signing Al Horford to a big contract and then not having him set screens is like signing JJ Redick and not having him shoot 3s."
"We‚Äôre talking about this season so maybe he should be dropped. But at least it made sense to list him given his body of work, unlike your boy. And Dame will bounce back. Btw ZERO winshares in 8 games. Can take out Kawhi too whom I hesitated including to begin with.   But then add Ja, DeMar, Brown, Miles Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, McCollum, Herro, Sabonis, Dejounte Murray, OG, Valenciunas, Brogdon, Richaun Holmes, Myles Turner, Draymond, Tobias Harris, Lowry, Randle, Seth, Montrezl Harrel, Al Horford, SGA, Ayton, Christian Wood - all winning players btw  Top 45 maybe"
But this is exact thread we're in now is specific to a stat about Steph. It's not about Cade Cunningham or Al Horford or whoever the fuck. Quit being so obtuse.
"Al Horford gets the Team Chemistry +5% bonus every time he does this shit, he's singlehandedly going to flinch the team back together again"
Al Horford is younger than Tatum and nobody can tell me otherwise.
"Al ""Vince Carter"" Horford"
##AL FUCKING HORFORD
How old is Al Horford????
I have no idea how the 76ers couldn't make this guy work. Al horford has to be the easiest guy to just plug into any team
i missed al horford not gonna lie
to be fair josh smith and al horford ran some pretty good PnRs close to the key

I wouldn't think twice about terry for al horford. Not sure why you would want terry back tho I feel like he's not what the celtics need at all.
Al Horford must just actually fucking hate the city of Philadelphia.
Al Motherfucking Horford
al horford could wind up with a low key triple double if the starters come back in.
"Marcus Smart is not a good leader no matter your score and Al Horford is a smart guy but has he ever been considered a ""leader?""  Veteran, absolutely, leader... no.  The issue is you guys play terribly selfish basketball, it's actually quite easy to see rather quickly."
"Brown and AL horford for KP, Powell, and trey. THanks and please."
"They role players definitely aren‚Äôt amazing but they‚Äôre solid. Marcus Smart trash start but he‚Äôs great defender, Al Horford leading league in blocks per game. Robert Williams solid, Josh Richardson solid, PP solid but needs more minutes. Shroeder has been good. I don‚Äôt expect this group of guys to win the Finals or anything but they‚Äôre better than they‚Äôre playing now"
"Im not saying they don‚Äôt, I mean the team looks like shit rn but if they were 5-2 everyone would be saying how great Al Horford and Marcus Smart have been as leaders. Also a brand new coach.  Moreso just saying it‚Äôs pretty difficult to tell what the issue is when we watch 8 hours of games a week and these guys spend every single day together"
"Your points are understandable. In response, He may have spoken his feelings after one game but that's not a reflection of just this game only. For the last couple seasons, Celtics fans have been complaining about playmaking on offense, play calling on offense and personnel. And on nights it works, it's not an issue and everyone's happy and when it doesn't, people get rightfully mad about it. The team is the same general makeup with a few subtractions and additions and when the same problems as usual come up, the same frustrations will too.  1. From a playmaking perspective, everyone we've had so far in the last 3 years is fine, passable but not terrific. This includes Kyrie, Kemba, the Jays and everyone else. Hayward was generally excluded from this as our best passer along with Horford but Horford left and Hayward was never fit. They Jays have improved on this aspect, yes, but not enough. When they struggle to get a shot, as you can see often from whenever Aaron Nesmith or Pritchard got the ball last year, or even lobs to Rob Williams, the pass is just a bit off. Enough that they can't go straight up and shoot it off the passes.  2. Play calling/offense. It's a lot of isos or 2 man screen game if any. It's a lot of your turn, my turn kind of offense and when it works, it's great. I'll throw it back to something Brad hammered home in our NBA finals year without kyrie. Paint touches. It's something from the eye test, no numbers to prove, to me that has decreased a by some amount. We worked hard that year to get it to Horford inside so we can get the ball outside more. And that has gone down as the Jays have gotten more involved with the offense. We still do run some cool stuff to run those kind of looks with Al now and at times with Rob Williams last season. We couldn't with Tristan Thompson with his stone hands and not as much with Kanter due to him being better off trying to score when he gets the ball. We can't really do that with Grant Williams because when he's at center, he's not in the pain often, as we play a 5 out of sorts. And when Tatum posts up, he's looking for one thing only and it's not to pass it out. We can definitely get better with that with our current personnel and we should but there needs to be gradual changes in that too.  3. Personnel. He's not always the problem. And its absolutely too soon to dislike it. Watching Josh Richardson has been pain so far. Some more Nesmith would be nice but I imagine he's not playing a lot for a reason. I'll choose to believe in Ime for now. We haven't had an out and out shooter for a while. None comes to mind. Could've been Tyler herro but Miami got to him in the draft first. And he's since shown to be more than that anyways. Wasn't Carson Edwards. Isn't Nesmith quite yet. So the who are they passing to criticism is fair, but obviously if trying to be solo offense isn't working and is costing us wins, then fucking pass even if they suck.   We suck at rebounding this season so far. Getting progressively worse every year. 21st in the league this season, 14th last season, 11th and 10th the 2 seasons before that.  Etc. Could go on. Don't want to be too much of a downer.   TL:DR Basically, things could be better. Smart isn't only frustrated about this game only and he isn't necessarily wrong either. And it isn't solely the Jays at fault. But it's fixable, and hopefully will be asap. I would rather be celebrate than bitching."
"Go back and watch the fourth quarter. They found Smart, Josh Richardson, Schroder, and Al Horford open for 3‚Äôs all throughout the 4th quarter. It‚Äôs not Jaylen or Jayson‚Äôs fault that those guys missed open shots."
"If you want yourself options for a tradez you dont "" preserve yourselt"" you show morr value, thats been the general pattern for older players on younger teams. See cp3 and al horford re establishing themselves, not getting dnps (not horford until his value was established)"
One: Al Horford.  Tatum and Brown do not deserve All-Star nods and I beg every other fan base to vote against them.
"Brown and Tatum have absolutely taken big leaps the last 4 years. The rest of the roster on the other hand...has not. If they had Al Horford from 4 years ago or pre injury Gordon Hayward, it might be different"

"I don‚Äôt think Smart can be the leading voice in the locker room. Conspiracy theory time, but I think the second Smart got paid (summer of 2018) is when he started trying to jump the hierarchy as the longest tenured Celtic and it started this dysfunction we‚Äôve been hearing about. It‚Äôs really hard to be a leader in a sport when you‚Äôre not the best player, or even the second best player on your team. I‚Äôm not a Smart hater but I think it‚Äôs ironic he called them out when he‚Äôs prone to taking dumb shots himself. Like I said, conspiracy theory.  However, I think there‚Äôs some truth to what he said here. Tatum/Brown not being able to play off of each other because they can‚Äôt run PnR action where they switch similar size defenders onto each other leaves them prone to standing around watching the other guy work. Their volume of shots combined just doesn‚Äôt leave enough for the rest of the team where if one of them has a bad game but takes 18-20 shots, the whole team suffers. The whole offense stutters and it throws off the whole rhythm and pace of the game, and with our team specifically, the effort.  Tatum and Brown are combining for nearly 45 shots a game (44.8) this season but combining for only 6.2 APG. In 2016-17 when they wildly overachieved, Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley and Al Horford took a combined 45.3 shots per game and combined for 13.1 APG. It is undeniable they played more team basketball than they are now."
"Well, I would have to guess they already talked about it and nothing changed so Smart decided to criticize them publicly as well... something is off when Al Horford is one of your best players so far and you have so many young studs lol... He saved their asses in more than one game... I love Al so props to him for playing his part perfectly but Jalen and Tatum need to chill the fuck out and play team basketball, especially Tatum. Cuz Smart is right, they ain't going nowhere if they don't come together and their record shows it, they look like shit most of the time and Tatum is forcing like crazy... Even freaking MJ couldn't do it by himself, Tatum is for sure not doing it. They need an authority figure on that bench, someone they respect... I would bet anything, if this squad was in Miami they would be scary as hell under Spo and Pat. They've been together for some time now and need to figure this out or shit is getting blown to pieces and soon!"
"meh dude formed a roster of  kyrie irving, jaylen brown, jayson tatum, gordon hayward, al horford, terry rozier, and marcus morris  thats a really fucking good team. like.. really good lol.   but got hit with basically worst case scenario and then the celtics were too content with not making moves after it fell apart  while he made mistakes, he did legitimately form an amazing team in 2018. just unfortunate that it didnt work out"
"Can somebody send this to KD and Jokic for reference   KD has shot a ridiculous 74/127 (58%) from the field so far this season. Jokic has also shot a ridiculous 68/112 (61%) from the field so far this season. Yet they refuse to take more than 15 shots a game.   While this Melo regen version of Tatum has shot a equally ridiculous 172 shots, going 68/172 (40%) in the process.   I was super excited for my boy the Time Lord to take a giant leap this year but with Tatum seemingly hell bent on playing hero ball, I don't think that's likely.    I am sure Ime is a great guy but his handling of Tatum so far has been extremely underwhelming. Tatum needs Al Horford to knock some sense into him. I swear, he desperately needs a vet PG like CP3 or Lowry to knock some sense into him"
Al Horford didn‚Äôt even play too bad this game
Give us 2 protected FRPs and DJ for a lightly used Al Horford
Never thought I‚Äôd be *appreciating Al Horford* with a *philly fan*
Honestly they'd probably have a chance in the East; the Bulls have been missing a true lead guard and SGA would do wonders there. Thunder also flush out the depth chart.   PG: SGA / Satoransky / George Hill   SG: LaVine / Coby White / Dort   SF: Otto Porter Jr / Patrick Williams / Justin Jackson  PF: Lauri Markannen / Thad Young / Darius Bazley   C: Al Horford / WCJ / Muscala
Al horford
Al Horford is a very good basketball player who fills a very specific role that did not exist on the 76ers.
"I anticipated that rebounding would be an issue like it has been throughout the season, but that‚Äôs not a stat I want to give up too often as a young team. The execution, the defense, etc, and other things I‚Äôm perfectly ok failing, but hustle plays like that I wish we can see more. Can‚Äôt let Cole Anthony get an offensive board like that.  I hope to see some different offensive sets. It feels like we rely a bit too much on individual brilliance. It‚Äôs early in the season with a new roster so the chemistry might not be there, and that‚Äôs completely understandable. However, I do hope to see some cuts and off-ball actions a little more, especially for bouncy young guys like Diallo and Bazley a la Westbrook lobs to Roberson. The offensive felt a little one-dimensional and there are just so many spread pick and rolls and pops you can learn with Diallo, Pokusevski, and Kenrich Williams. As the young guys develop more offensive feels, perhaps we can see some more of that, maybe double screen up top with Bazely sipping to the rim and Horford popping.  A little fortunate regarding Orlando's shooting. Yes, they were missing Fournier but they couldn't hit anything. Definitely got away with that one.  WE HIT OUR FREE THROWS HALLELUJAH, a bit of a regression to the mean after being ranked last in the league coming into the game. Speaking of regression to the mean, I kinda fear that such is going to happen sooner than later to Lu Dort and Mike Muscala‚Äôs three-point stroke. Hopefully, they prove me wrong.  Theo Maledon masterclass here. The rook guided an often not-so-good Thunder second unit almost singlehandedly. That sling pass from his left hand to the corner to set up a Diallo three was just too sweet.  Darius Bazley heard me talking trash and proved me dead wrong today. Played hard in every aspect, shot the ball well, another double-double, and played some phenomenal defense. If he continues to do this, he will be one of the best young 3-and-D forward, which is hard to come by nowadays. Player of the game easily.  George Hill continues to be a steady veteran presence who took over for a little bit in the third quarter to help the stagnant offensive. Al Horford made some huge plays at the end to put the game to an end. With the presence of Horford, the rim protection took a noticeable boost as well.  Diallo disasterclass. I don‚Äôt want to see this take another step back mid-range jumper again. I am not a fan of him being tasked with running the offense more when we have three point guards - that‚Äôs just not gonna be his role in the NBA.  Kenrich Williams is trying his best to give minutes to Justin Jackson.  Pokusevski also had a pretty rough outing, but unlike the other two above, zero worries about him at the moment.   Sad to see Isaiah Roby not get any minutes but it wasn‚Äôt really a great matchup for him.   Nonetheless, the Thunder just played solid basketball for 48 minutes and beat a team that is on a roll, given they are missing their best offensive weapon. We competed hard and looked like a completely different team than the one that got blown out by the Pelicans. Hopefully, we find some more consistency and continue to surprise some folks in the league. Thunder up!"
We've always been Al Horford Appreciators.
Al Horford was a rookie?
Al Horford was a rookie?
I have nothing to be mad about lol. My team didn‚Äôt piss away a top 15 player for al horford.
Russell Westbrook for Al Horford + George Hill
If they give him up for Harden they‚Äôre nuts. What they really need is a defensive big who can guard AD passably. Someone like Al Horford with knees.
"I actually wanted Al horford. I wanted to sign Al Horford and keep Jimmy butler and JJ. You gotta understand up until that point for 3 straight years the sixers had really good starters and fell apart no matter what when Embiid wasn't on the court. At the same time I'm watching all the success the raptors have with using Ibaka as backup 4/5. Also Al Horford had just had a ton success gaurdinf Giannis whereas Giannis was torching us.   The truth is the horford signing did half of what it was supposed to. The sixers didn't fall apart when embiid wasn't on the court anymore, they now fell apart when Simmons wasn't on the court. The original sins were not keeping Jimmy and JJ to me. I think Al really took too much heat. Playing Tobi and Horford at forward was stupid. Letting Jimmy and JJ walk was absurd.   I still think it might've worked if they just brought horford off the bench and stopped playing Tobi, Horford, Embiid together. This was actually the plan going into the bubble and we did it for like two games but Simmons got hurt and Brett panicked and started Horford again."

"Cap space is not just for free agents. The Thunder need space to do more Al Horford-esque trades to take on contracts and get picks. They have a limited window to take advantage of that, so they need to capitalize when they can."
Al Horford and Isaiah Thomas both loved their time in Boston. I don't think a single former Celtics player has come out and said they didn't like playing in Boston this century but I could be wrong.
"I love this comment because you could think of it as AI as in Iverson, or Al as in Horford, and both would be true"
I got one Al horford I can let go.
"Idk man, we traded Al Horford for Danny Green on an expiring contract."
"YESSIR BRUNSON BURNER ON THE LOOSE.  I didn't want the game but Stats seem pretty efficient, glad we have him on the team.  Okc fans I can only say this, I always forget   Al Horford is on your team"
"He's 6'10"" in shoes with a 7'1"" wingspan and 9'0"" standing reach. He's definitely big enough, especially since he's still growing in to his body. His real asset is that he could become an Al Horford style flexible anchor, but of course at this age he can get bullied by a vet like Dwight, and Bradley is genuinely huge."
al horford blowing by maxi is a really bad look for maxi
Dude is the anti Al Horford
"It's wild how utterly delusional this take is.  * FRP for Rondo * Made two insanely huge trades to land both KG and Ray * Perkins for Green  * Doc Rivers for a FRP * KG + Pierce for 5 FRPs (two of which became Tatum and Brown) * My personal favorite trade NOTHING for Marcus Thorton, Tyler Zeller, FRP * Zeller + FRP for IT + Jerebko * Rondo for Crowder, filler, FRP * Green for MEM FRP  * 1st overall (Fultz) for Tatum + FRP (which turned into 2 FRPs through more moves) * Crowder, Zizic, IT &amp; BRK FRP for Kyrie  Signed Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, and Kemba Walker to max free agent deals.  Missed the playoffs once since 2008.  I know Knicks fans have no idea what success looks like but jesus christ dude."
Dwight lost to Al Horford and his 44 win Hawks........
2011 Orlando was definitely a better team than last years Sixers sans Simmons lol.   JRich/Hedo/Rasheed Lewis/Jameer Nelson/Vince Carter was an absolutely great supporting cast compared to Tobias Harris and old ass Al Horford. The fact that you think it was a ‚Äúmuch worse team than Embiid has ever played with‚Äù is a horrible take. I should be the one asking YOU if you were watching basketball back then.
Tobias Harris al horford josh Richardson shake Milton I think jj reddick? Or did he leave? Do you not know the roster last year or what?
"&gt; If you keep thinking your window is later you‚Äôre gonna reach a point where Tatum and browns deals are gonna be up and it‚Äôs not a lock the resign.   Our window isn't now because Tatum and Brown aren't good enough as players yet.   All you dumb Nets and Lakers fans who have an agenda against the Celtics like to create this faux state of urgency for the Celtics, when, if you actually fucking watched a Celtics game, you'd know that both players have a LONG way to go as players if they want to compete for a championship if they are the best players on the team. Neither of them know how to make anybody on their team better.   &gt; People aren‚Äôt clowning you for not trading for jrue they‚Äôre clowning you guys for having the best draft capital haul in history and not making a title contender with it  The 2018-19 Celtics had a starting 5 of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford and a bench of Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes.   That was the best 9-man rotation anybody in the NBA had that year. Vegas had us as favorites to make it out of the Eastern Conference.   Not Danny Ainge's fault that Gordon Hayward was a shell of himself after he broke his fucking leg and couldn't be the 2nd best player on the team like he was supposed to be."
The floor spacing 5 is a myth   All these Myles Turner serge ibaka al horford Nikola Jokic types nobody guards regardless of what % they shoot. Teams let them shoot. Nobody cares they don‚Äôt get guarded   You can count on one hand the number of 5s with legitimate gravity who have actual floor spacing. That‚Äôs not an undercount either
If Al Horford could trick a team with a franchise center into giving him a hundred million dollar deal at age 33 I think Kemba could realistically get paid.
"&gt; You build a wall with 2 all defensive players and 2 other great to elite defenders. Like Kawhi, Gasol, Siakam, Green. Also Bam, Butler, Crowder, Iguodala  FTFY  You think the C‚Äôs and Magic didn‚Äôt try the wall strategy lol? The C‚Äôs just had Al Horford and no one else, and we saw how that went, he averaged 28 ppg. Against the Magic they also tried. Didn‚Äôt work"
Yes you do lmao. The Celtics tried with just Al Horford but you saw how that went. Blake and DJ fouling out before halftime if they try to wall.
Giannis dropped 28/12/6 on Al Horford lol
"I assume there must be some behind the scenes negotiations for sure because anyone in their right minds would not think that guys like Al Horford or Hayward would have opted out of their big money contracts but somehow not only did they opt out, they got a shit load more money in their new contract. Fair play to Hayward tho he is playing pretty well in Charlotte."
"Don‚Äôt forget to mention trading Luka for Trae on draft night, losing prime Al Horford for nothing, shifting Schr√∂der for Melo, ownership holding the city hostage to get a $250m unnecessary arena renovation, and ditching Coach Bud he took us to the ECF/60 win season.   If you don‚Äôt like all that, you don‚Äôt like Atlanta Hawks basketball"
If he were to get in he would be one of the least impactful players towards winning to ever be in the HOF. All kinds of players should get in. Demar Derozan should get in too. Kevin Love should get in. Al Horford should get in.
Became a Steph fan after the Knicks game even tho I liked Klay the most. And Steph became my favourite after the OKC game.  I like Al Horford too but Steph Curry is too cool man
"Because it could be anything, even an Al Horford!"
You just got rid of Al Horford. Why do you want to trade for another Al Horford?
"Al Horford. I could say KAT, but he was born and raised at New York, but he did played for D.R so either of those 2"
"For the most part yes. Throughout their entire title run, the Warriors had a rotating cast of centers. David Lee. Andrew Bogut. Kevon Looney. etc.   The Raptors problems come more from having both Serge Ibaka and Mark Gasol leave in one offseason and they either didn't have the guys on the roster or sign anyone in free agency to replace those players. Ibaka and Gasol are both pick-n-pop bigs who can protect the rim, and losing Gasol's passing was a big blow to their offense and the sets they could run off that.   Baynes has the pick-n-pop going, but can't stay on the court defensively. He started off hot for Phoenix last year, but he got worse as the year went on and even when he was producing it wasn't on the defensive end of the floor. Boucher looks really good and can provide *some* rim protection, but he is way too skinny and can get bullied by bigger guys with regularity.   Celtics have the same issue. Since trading Isaiah Thomas, the Celts have lost and/or traded: Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, and Jae Crowder. They have replaced those guys with Tristan Thompson, Robert Williams, Kemba Walker, Daniel Theis, and Jeff Teague.  Just from a pure talent standpoint, they have lost significantly at every position, and they haven't drafted well to replace what they lost. Kemba is playing better as of late, but he is still a defensive sieve and Teague has been a total loss for this team. Theis is good and gives great effort, but he is undersized at the position and gets dad dicked with regularity.   The Celtics are missing more than a true center, and even if they did have one to anchor their defense (Timelord looks like the player they need at C), they have such a lack of depth on the wing and guard positions that they would still be struggling."
"I love JoJo but it was a conversation at the time the severity as well as the coincidental convenience of the sickness and him playing like shit in an almost arbitrary pattern. He was pulling off windmills on that series lol, I‚Äôm not sure how sick he was as he pulled out the sickness excuse right after th e games where he played shit ended.   Not to mention Giannis dropped 29/12/6 on the Celtics the year before when they actually had someone like Al Horford (the ‚ÄúGiannis Stopper‚Äù) as opposed to Theis, and Giannis would probably average 40 if he went against the 2020 Celtics"
"He's been wrong since, but I agree with you: the Al Horford bomb was completely out of nowhere and he was the first to report that by quite a bit. I know he gets made fun of, but funny enough I think as time goes on he actually looks better. The confidence he had seems to reflect on the stories of how the rest of management felt during the same stretch."
Yah I think once again people are somehow underrating the Warriors approach which is way more Spurs-like.   The KD addition made them a SuperTeam but they were dominant as hell playing team basketball and basically did it with just adding a versatile defender and Center.  If the Warriors got Jeremy Grant and Al Horford for a year with Klay back they‚Äôll be back as the #1 or #2 next year.
"I don't understand how RDA whiffing on Kawhi (which was still really bad) offsets the fact that he called the Al Horford 76ers signing out of nowhere. Dude had sources, and I wouldn't doubt that Kawhi gave the impression that he was going to be a Laker."
"Yeah I‚Äôm not blaming him. If your teammates can‚Äôt beat 4v3 then you won‚Äôt win. I saw that with Harden vs the Lakers last year as well. Even someone like Al Horford would be nice, but that contract is awful"
Al Horford will be on the bench for the 2023 champions
Al Horford is westbrook eating popcorn at the game rn
Yeah I‚Äôm really worried about Josh Richardson and Al Horford having another bad series against you guys
That‚Äôs because you snaked us with Al Horford
"We have 5 games in 7 days but aren't allowed to rest players. Al Horford is currently drinking milkshakes in Cancun,  and Silver allows, but not for us. Our players are living in a hotel away from their families and Silver expects them to play 3 back-to-backs a week even though half of them had COVID."
did you watch these series? our second best player was out last year and joel put up 30/10 easily with his entire team playing like shit. 2018 al horford was clearly an elite joel defender and that man is not coming back to boston
"&gt;Ok? Doesn't that make it even more impressive that Kobe who had another guy taking so many possessions put up similar or better stats than a guy who's been the first option since his 2nd year.   Not when you look at how Shaq was guarded which allowed for Kobe to cook.    &gt;Even then Tatum has had Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, Kemba Walker, Jalen Brown and Al horford. Don't pretend that Tatum didn't have help at all. Which is a dumb argument regardless Tatum better despite the stats because kobe had Shaq  I would say you're argument for Kobe that you made in the first paragraph applies here more. Tatum had multiple players gunning for his shots. I won't say he's better but he's doing very well. We'll see how he stacks up with Kobe at the end."
"Ok? Doesn't that make it even more impressive that Kobe who had another guy taking so many possessions put up similar or better stats than a guy who's been the first option since his 2nd year.    Even then Tatum has had Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, Kemba Walker, Jalen Brown and Al horford. Don't pretend that Tatum didn't have help at all. Which is a dumb argument regardless Tatum better despite the stats because kobe had Shaq"
Trade for Al Horford
Your team is utter dog shit. If you‚Äôre proud of beating The 6th seed Al Horford / JRich/ Tobias Sixers with Embiid still slanging dick on you go for it boss. At our worst we never fell below .500 you‚Äôre sorry ass team can barely breathe without dropping below. Worst Celtics team in a hot ass minute.
"LEGEND SCOOP: Al Horford tells me he will play again this season.  The ‚Äúinjured‚Äù Thunder center, who was dining at Golden Corral in Oklahoma City, walked in with no limp and without crutches.  I didn‚Äôt look for a cast because I was too afraid of the bodyguard at his table."
"So list it and avoid this exact situation  Edit: the fine is still stupid, especially with the whole al horford thing, but it‚Äôs not tough to avoid."
"Al Horford had great years in Boston after 30 too. I guess not a late bloomer since he had a great career in Atlanta but his 3pt shooting, facilitating and defensive versatility seemed to really click and elevate in Boston. Alex English and Jermaine O'Neal come to mind as well"
LMAO Al Horford is sipping Pina Coladas on a beach somewhere and OKC didn‚Äôt have to hear a peep from the league about it. Fuck Adam Silver
Meanwhile Al Horford in OKC is getting an early vacation and no injury
"But they didn‚Äôt offer him the max, fool brand offered Harris the max (I know he‚Äôs been good but not better than Jimmy) and then signed al Horford lmao"
To be fair that year he was picked last and then joke was that Horford was barely an all star at that point. Not to diminish Al cause he played his role perfectly those playoffs but Jaylen and Jayson were absolutely the best players on that team.
"the year Isaiah had, he was gonna get paid if he stayed healthy. 29 points and 6 assists leading Boston to 50 wins and ECF as literally the only all star on a team where the second scoring option was Avery Bradley followed by a slumping Al Horford. That was literally a superstar calibre year."
Al Horford
Al Horford
Al horford was the Celtic's best player that year.
Are you certain it‚Äôs not cause players want to play in LA. I mean holy shit do you see the FA‚Äôs the Patriots get? Top level talents taking pay cuts. Al Horford and Ray Allen literally signed with Boston.
"Just like we said no to Gordan Hayward, Ray Allen, trading for Kyrie, Al Horford?  Is that your best comeback?"
"They still had Al Horford, maybe I just view him a lot higher than other, but he was absolutely instrumental to Boston‚Äôs success early on  EDIT: it‚Äôs also not a take. This is factually the first season Boston will not have an All-Star outside of Tatum or Brown"
If you give the Thunder some picks then they might give you one old and mildly used Al Horford
We can‚Äôt all give 33 year old Al Horford 109 million dollars
"Spurs fans fuckin hate Richard Jefferson lol  In the exact same vein, Sixers fans hate Al Horford. He made Joel Embiid unhappy so it‚Äôs justified"
Kevin Love and Al Horford. Makes sense yes. :)
al horford was the best player that run however.  jays were better than kemba last year tbf
2018 they were the leading scores in the playoffs and went 7 games with Lebron in the ECF. Al Horford was a huge help but the Jays took them to the ECF. Rozier was important as well.
He gives off Al Horford vibes more than Chris Bosh tbh. Esp with his playmaking
"Horford makes like $27M next year, you'd have to include Wiggins to get the money to match.   Wiggins+Wiseman for Horford+Bradley works $-wise, but that's a lot to pay for an old Al Horford (even though Bradley is a nice C prospect for the future - including an 18/11 game against Wiseman last month - his ceiling is nowhere near Wiseman's)."
"right cuz its not like we signed al horford, gordon hayward, and kemba walker in the past 5 years. and the second u gotta bring up other games to distract from the fact that a game got rigged for u, u lost. just take the L and move on."
I mean this is just so wrong is kinda funny. The Thunder are probably more aggressively tanking than any team in the league. We literally just told Al Horford who was like our 2nd best player for the first half of the season to fuck off because we were winning too much. We are resting every good player and are putting up lineups that are essentially G league teams + 1 NBA level player every once in a while.
"Rose played with 2x all star, 1x all-nba, 3x all defensive Joakim Noah and 2x all star, 1x all defensive Luol Deng.   So yes, on those teams he actually played with active all star and all nba players so your point is stupid.   Embiid definitely choked the 2nd round of his first playoffs. Against the Raptors he was literally a +11 in 45 minutes played. The Sixers and Greg Monroe managed to choke enough in those 3 minutes he sat to lose.   Last year, Embiid did not choke. The bubble was weird for every team. Our roster was a mess to begin with, just by having Al Horford. Embiid dominated that series, but the rest of the team couldn‚Äôt do anything or make a shot."
idk jo had awful games and didnt get boo'd.  mostly only the entire team or jerryd bayless/ al horford get boo'd
It won't happen. If OKC didn't buy Carmelo Anthony out or Kendrick Perkins out I would bet that Al Horford will not get bought out either (unless he gives back a significant amount of money). I would rather him sit the bench all season next year than buy him out and let a contender like Brooklyn get him for free. If you want him that bad trade for him.
The Nets should try to trade for Al Horford in the off season.
"I'm kinda sick of this take.   Brown coached us exceptionally well in the playoffs vs Toronto when we got bounced by Kawhi. The front office did Brett exactly 0 favors that offseason. Our roster construction was so dogshit that I'm not sure Popovich, Kerr, or Nurse could have fixed it.   Going into the year after that Toronto series we replaced Jimmy with Jrich and JJ Redick with Al Fucking Horford. Right off the bat we lose not 1 but 2 of our most important offensive options from the previous season, 1 being a ball handler/shot creator and the other being our only reliable volume 3 point shooter who had one of the best 2 man games with Embiid EVER. Shake Milton wasn't a reliable player at that point and we almost cut Furkan because he was actually ass early on. So now instead of having an ""ok"" offense we have some amalgamate of bigmen 4's and 5's and a single ""guard"" in J Rich who doesn't even shoot the 3 well enough to make up for everything that offense lacked.  The Brett Brown slander is such revisionist history based on last season, he was a fucking fantastic coach who got fucked over by the front office/ownership."
At least he aint getting traded for the corpse of Al Horford lol
So says a guy that rooted for al Horford for all of those years
"We really gotta talk about how Philly made Brett Brown run out a starting lineup with Ben Simmons, Josh Richardson, Tobias Harris, Al Horford, and Embiid and then blamed him for that shit falling on its face"
The best PG for Celts was ...  1. Rozier  2. Kyrie   3. Kemba  Answer is Al Horford!!!
"Al Horford wouldn‚Äôt be letting this happen, that‚Äôs all I know"
"&gt;got back the same contract that they passed up in favor of Kemba‚Äôs  They ""passed up"" on that contract because you'd have to be a fucking moron to pay $100 million for a 33-year-old Al Horford (especially if you have a center already). Just because the Celtics traded for Horford doesn't mean they suddenly like his contract now. It's damage control because Kemba's contract is even worse as a result of his injuries."
"For an OKC  guy., you rarely mention al horford."
lol al horford is playoff death
Al Horford is tired of being in the middle of Bostons confusing mess!!
"That's the one time they've paid the tax in the last decade. Boston's ownership is notorious for saying they'll pay the tax ""for a winner"" which this team clearly is not. They just salary dumped Kemba, what more proof do you need that they're looking to avoid the tax next year? Do you think they value Al Horford so much they preferred to give up their 1st round pick and Kemba to get him? They're not going into the tax this year, sorry."
"&gt;If this is the last Simmons/Embiid game how I‚Äôll you remember them as a duo?  Al Horford &amp; Tobias Harris together essentially just destroyed Trust the Process lol.  Stuff like this sucks, but unfortunately this is the result of not having a competent FO."
The disrespect with Al Horford
Al horford can barely run down the court anymore he‚Äôs nowhere near how he was on the Celtics in 2018
"It‚Äôs not disingenuous,it‚Äôs the main reason.  Al Horford contract is $40 million guaranteed for the next two season compared to Kemba‚Äôs $70 million.   In the short term, this gives the Celtics more flexibility to retain players and trying to re-sign Evan Fournier in Free Agency.  In long term (summer 2022), Horford‚Äôs contract is easier to move off the books if they wanted to target a Max Free Agent like Bradley Beal."
People said this about Chris Paul and Al Horford.
"2018 was a long time ago my man. Al Horford was a 31 year old all-star, Terry Rozier was balling tf out, and Joel Embiid wasn't an MVP candidate.  I agree that Tatum and Brown will be significantly better than they were, but what does Boston have outside of that? They have no identity at the moment, and it doesn't make sense to believe in them until they do."
Yeah. A washed Al Horford was winning games. Prime Al wasn‚Äôt winning games by himself.
I mean who wouldn't want to coach the great Al Horford?
"I wouldn‚Äôt say that, you guys have looked like shit in the playoffs, Celtics got beat by the Nets at full strength but stole a game and played them close a few times. You guys have no excuse to be losing to the Hawks and let‚Äôs not even talk about that epic collapse last game.  I never said it was a brilliant move by the Celtics? It was a necessary one. Your mental gymnastics about signing Al over Kemba makes no sense, wish you‚Äôd stop regurgitating the same nonsense over and over. Kemba got hurt, his contract was limiting us, so they moved him and got some players back that should help now and maybe down the road. A mid first pick is not that valuable, so it‚Äôs not that costly of a dump off. I hope you keep that same hindsight bias with all the blown decisions your own team has made (drafting Fultz, drafting and maxing Simmons, trading for Butler only to walk, signing Horford to that terrible deal). As they stand now, Celtics have much more potential to win a title vs the Sixers who have 0% chance as long as they have Simmons on a max deal."
"I mean we‚Äôre certainly getting closer than Boston lol if you want to make it about talking shit. Kemba makes more money per year than Horford, so no, it was not about cap room. Kemba was always a small point guard who couldn‚Äôt defend, there was always a risk he would fall off quickly and sharply, for whatever reason.   I already acknowledged that it‚Äôs hindsight. But don‚Äôt act like this is some brilliant move for the Celtics. Call it whatever you want - you just gave up the 16th pick in the draft to dump the player that you signed instead of Al Horford‚Ä¶ for Al Horford. If Moses Brown is enough to make you feel good about that then good for you."
Al Horford is not that good wtf üòÇ
Yeah. 2 vet all stars need a washed Al Horford to hold their hands across the street.
Oh yeah. Al Horford was gonna win OKC a bunch of games by himself.
"There was a limitation, they didn‚Äôt have the cap room. Idk if you need this explained to you if not, but this deal is not about getting Horford back, it‚Äôs about dumping Kemba‚Äôs salary. You act like Brad has been feigning to get Big Al back the last 2 years lol  Whose remaining contract is bigger, Kembas or Horfords, especially when considering guaranteed money? You have such a dumb way of thinking about things lol so they were supposed to predict the future if Kembas knee injuries? We are getting an asset back too in the form of 20+ million in cap space plus a 21 year old 7‚Äô2‚Äù prospect.  If I were you, I‚Äôd worry a little more about your own teams situation because we all know that this current team has no chance of winning a title as currently constructed. Must be nice to get the attention off Simmons and your teams collapse for a day."
Al Horford coming back to Boston is peak Thanos meme after Celtics failures in the playoffs.
I don't love this. Moses is a good pick-up &amp; I'm OK with clearing Kemba Walker but I don't love bringing back Al Horford or getting rid of the #16 overall pick. Feels like we got fleeced.
"&gt;Celtics save $20 million in cap space,   Actually Horford is only making $9 million less this year than Kemba is ($36 million for Kemba, $27 million for Al). Only $14.5 million of Horford's 2022-23 contract is guaranteed (unless Philly makes the Finals this year or next year, or wins the title, then more or all of it would be guaranteed), so Boston could just eat that money next summer and cut him."
Al Horford is a Variant.
"Well, the Celtics lost a first round pick, for starters. Al Horford really isn‚Äôt too good, he may bring in veteran leadership but i don‚Äôt see him contributing a ton to the team winning games, Moses Brown just isn‚Äôt good, he‚Äôs over 7 foot and can‚Äôt finish. And then they just swapped 2nds. They traded Kemba for Al Horford, which you could call a win if you account for salary but player skill is a big L. Then they traded the number 16 pick for Moses Brown. Big L, the guy is seven foot and his touch around the rim is nonexistent. Then they traded a 25 second for a 23 second, which doesn‚Äôt really matter and is just kinda a meh, i guess it‚Äôll depend on what team is worse what year."
Ben Simmons and Doc for Kem‚Ä¶ Payton Pritchard and Al Horford and 2018 Nets Pick.   Make it happen Silver!
"Got flamed by all the Celtics fans when I said trading Kyrie for Kemba was a bad move. Fast forward a few years, they‚Äôve done absolutely nothing of note and they‚Äôve traded him AND a 1st rounder to get Al Horford back. Meanwhile Kyrie‚Äôs team is looking like they‚Äôre gonna be a contender for the next few years."
The Al Horford and Tristan Thompson front court would have been excellent about 5 fucking years ago..  And they have Lob Billy and Moses Brown too. More trades are coming
Lmfao Al Horford and they sent a 1st
"Al Horford: ""You couldn't deal with your own failure. And where did that lead you? Back to me."""
"Yeah, but he‚Äôs young too. We should let Tristan walk and have him and TimeLord, with Grant Williams and Al Horford being able to play center too."
"&gt;Celtics free up 9M in salary(roughly) to bring in a FA.  Ehh more about saving ownership a buck than anything else. Celtics only play is still resigning Fournier and using whatever exceptions we can manage; nothing changes on that front. And short of someone like Beal demanding to play in Boston we'd still need a ton to go our way to be players in 22-23's free agency/ offseason.  &gt;I don‚Äôt know if Horford is a true starter at this point in his career, but he will definitely be productive in Boston.  The problem here is our Center rotation is back to being bloated af with Robert Williams, Tristan Thompson, Al Horford, and Moses Brown all in play. Until we make another move we've effectively taken a step back in that regard."
"But that‚Äôs what ‚Äúretooling‚Äù is! Exchanging the pieces around your core players. Or maybe we just have different definitions. And that‚Äôs fine.  I agree that Al was good for us. But if the goal is to develop Roby and Bazley then there‚Äôs no point in having him log jamming the front court.  Plus, I‚Äôm almost certain Horford had say in this. They did the same with CP. Both Horford and Paul were good soldiers and then were able to go ahead on their terms to a desirable location. That‚Äôs what it seems like at least."
"Celtics are set at center now, which they were undermanned at before. Robert Williams/Al Horford/Moses Brown is a really good rotation  I wonder if this is a sign that Brad has faith in Marcus Smart as the starting PG, or if more is to come"
Lol why? Al horford is a better fit.
All reports are that Danny was going to offer almost identical money to Horford after the Kemba S&amp;T but Al already committed to Philly
My god if Love throws enough of a temper tantrum that he gets the Cavs to throw in a first just to swap him for Al Horford I wont stop laughing.
Nooooooo you‚Äôre interested in Al Horford? :-)
Maybe they will utilize Al Horford as Moses Brown's mentor as it makes sense for other Celtic bigs to develop skills under Al.
"Al can help Williams get better though. Improve his shooting and FTs. Improve his passing.  Mostly, Time Lord needs to become a passable threat when holding the ball at the top of the perimeter, like Horford and Theis were. It opens up the lanes for Brown and Tatum. Pick and roll with Pritchard and Smart will also be nice."
Pretty funny how they have such unique but similar bodies and they easily could‚Äôve been playing together in New Orleans   Have no idea why they traded for Steven adams AND extended him when someone like al horford would be a much better fit
"I get they wanted to get rid of Kemba.. but I don't see how they did really anything to benefit the team.. Al Horford is on his last legs, Who the hell is Moses Brown, and 2nd round picks are almost meaningless. They better hope they can get a big time free agent or they are going to lose a whole lot of games next year."
Damn... Imagine not trading your picks all these years to trading it for Al Horford
If your idea of cleaning is giving a 1st for Al Horford I'd hate to see what your house is like
"[Horford's last year: ](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/boston-celtics/al-horford-2199/#:~:text=Current%20Contract,dead%20cap%20value%20of%20%2427%2C500%2C000.) - 26.5MM - 14.5MM dead cap hit  So I guess (to refine what you rightly put) if he's cut, then it's the latter for the cap hit. Clearly less than Kemba's number, but it won't exist per se, it will have to be worked in with exceptions and other cap hits."
"how do celtics fans feel about this? it seems pretty bleak, are they doing it to ship those two off for someone else? i don't see al horford and moses brown pushing the needle..."
"It seems like they took Al Horford and Chris Paul both in an effort to rehab them, increase their value, and trade them somewhere they can be productive. I‚Äôm just hoping they do the same with Kemba."
"I kind of expect it, but wouldn't be shocked if they don't.  May actually make sense to wait until after the season starts.    Timelord still has to prove he can handle 30 minutes every night and stay healthy, Horford is a very different type of center, and Moses Brown is a young project type.  Let's say you trade TT, and then Timelord has same health issues as this past season and Moses struggles.  You just can't have 35 year old Al Horford being your only reliable big.   Real question is what you do with TT's salary.  If there's not a great option, he probably has more value on the roster."
"You should stop trying to go all in on these stars in free agency/trading for em because it keeps doing nothing for you guys - Hayward then Kyrie then Kemba has left you with Al Horford, who you already had  Bringing in a new star just takes away from Jay&amp;Jay, which has been the problem for actual years now  Sign some actual depth with the cap space smh"
TIL Al Horford was on the Thunder last year
This is gonna look so bad for the Celtics in two years when that #16 pick works out well for okc and al horford tanks‚Ä¶.
"&gt; I really dont think 35 year old Al Horford is a better basketball player than Kemba Walker  Well that's completely incorrect.   https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=horfoal01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=walkeke02&amp;p2yrfrom=2021  They played pretty similar, and Horford on the Celtics gelled with Smart and the Jays in a way Kemba never did. He provides great leadership, the players love him, and doesn't have a degenerative knee.   No one's saying he's an All-Star. He fits us way better than Kemba will."
"So in a way, they turned Terry Rozier, Al Horford, Kyrie Irving,.Lbs Walker, Gordon Hayward and a first round pick into older Al Horford.   NEAT"
Al Horford no matter what
That‚Äôs fair. I personally don‚Äôt think Kemba brings the same positive value as CP3 did to OKC so it seems kind of pointless to have him in the lineup unless SGA can make jumps into high level all-star status. Kemba is 31 and isn‚Äôt getting any younger. Most of his game is largely due to his explosiveness and quickness which will decline rapidly over the next few years and his injury trouble only accelerates his decline. He‚Äôs not gonna be a trade asset 2-3 years from now and he won‚Äôt take you all that far this year. I just see him as an upgraded trade piece from Al Horford tbh
"That's a pretty good haul.   You aren't likely to get a better player than Moses Brown with the 16th pick. That dude was a rebounding phenom this season. I haven't seen him play to be honest, so I can't speak to his defensive game or offensive game (though he seems at least to know enough not to take shots he doesn't have a good chance of making given his FG% is over .500).   Al Horford might be 34 and owed two pricey seasons of salary, but he's the glue guy they've been missing.   They should have never let him go.  It's a shame. Hanging onto Kyrie and letting him walk cost this team so much. They could have just traded him during his last season and got any number of pieces back for him and not lost Scary Terry or Horford along the way."
"I dont think you know what a strawman argument is.   Philly has been on the trade destination list of every superstar thats demanded a trade. Yall are desirable, you just refuse to trade Ben Simmons. You literally had Jimmy Butler there and willing to play for you, but you chose Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons over him.  You got Al Horford. Lowry and Harden wanted to be traded to you, Kawhi was available for everybody to go after."
Bruh that Al Horford pick and pop with Kyrie was my bread and butter üò≠
Why give up so much for Al Horford? Is it to get Kemba off the books?
"Al Horford won this trade, he got the big bag and a ‚ÄúDNP-too good‚Äù vacation and ended up in the same place"
"I‚Äôm sure an NBA coach can make use of Al Horford, stupid"
Al horford is going to be 36 next season‚Ä¶
"What do you mean, the Celtics get 2022 Al Horford for all those stars. Is that not good?"
"It‚Äôs still so weird to me when I see people refer to Al Horford as ‚ÄúBig Al,‚Äù because that was Al Jefferson‚Äôs nickname for years."
Wait. So Boston now have: TimeLord TT Al Horford Moses Brown and... Tacko Fall? That's a lot of Bigs.
"I know y‚Äôall needed to get rid of Kemba, but I feel like if Boston put a few more pieces in there, they could‚Äôve  gotten an a lot better trade than 35 year old Al Horford who hasn‚Äôt played in awhile and Moses Brown. Not dissing Moses Brown, he looks like he could be a good talent if he develops right but I don‚Äôt think aging Al Horford was worth it."
"BRUH. We got Kemba and 2 picks for a dinosaur in Al Horford, Moses from the bible, and a 2nd round pick?  That's it? My god, this is a robbery"
"I mean they only saved about 10 million bucks this year and next and now have to employ al horford again, is it really *that* huge of a change/improvement?"
Like an Al Horford type of vet?
"Love Al, but the real prize was getting Anna Horford back"
G League guy who is tall and apparently good? Not too much info on them. Kemba was just useless for them in any big game. I‚Äôve been a long term Al Horford hater so that‚Äôs disappointing he‚Äôs back
[Al Horford be like](https://imgur.com/aTAYC5z)
"Al Horford: ""You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me. """
"TIL there‚Äôs another guy named Al Horford in the NBA.   I thought there was only the one, but it couldn‚Äôt be him because we let him walk after over-paying him through 3 injury-plagued seasons."
"I‚Äôve been waiting to root for Al Horford again. Couldn‚Äôt root for him on the Sixers, then he went to the thunder where there wasn‚Äôt much to root for and he just ending up sitting. Back to a contending team, and oh shit it‚Äôs us again!"
Al Horford was on the Celtics for awhile. He still has strong connections to the organization. Yes this is a move for salary cap relief. However Al Horford was really liked in the locker room so he will bring veteran leadership and anything else will be a bonus for Boston.
"I like Moses brown and al horford but I‚Äôm guessing this is just the beginning of many moves to free up cap space for a 3rd star.  Moses brown is a great, young center who can really rebound.  Al is also a great team guy."
"Why is Al Horford always being traded?  He's no fucking good, ever."
"Kemba is likely done being a good player. His knee is gone, and his contract is horrible. Kemba being traded for Horford was a deal one could have predicted months ago.  OKC was the only team able to take Kenna‚Äôs contract (and also be willing) and Brad Stevens loves Al Horford.  I‚Äôm very confident Horford will bring more value to the team that Kemba, and that‚Äôs before you account for Kenna‚Äôs contract."
"As Celtics fan, I‚Äôm piss we flirt with bunch center and we end up with more aged Al Horford with contract we never wanted pay himself smh second round exit here we go"
"That's a lot of trust in Al Horford by the Celtics. I feel like people underestimate Browns Value in this trade as he is on a very team friendly deal and has good potential but it will be interesting to see if Horford can redeem himself in Boston, which I doubt. Also, the Celtics get two centers and lose a great ball handler, while the time lord looked more than promising lately. I don't really get this tbh. Why would the Celtics do that?"
They gave up a first rounder just to get rid of him he's so bad for them. Not even improving cap situation that much cuz Al Horford has a terrible contract too.
Al Horford too
Kemba for Al Horford wat a fucking joke
"What kind of fucking trade is this?  Trading perennial all star in Kemba walker and a first round pick for the old ass body of AL Horford, some unproven young player and a 2nd round pick?"
"Kemba-Horford swap was pretty popular and was talked about all season in our subreddit. Al at least does things we need and is being paid less money. Obviously, the plan was never to be a part of paying Al Horford this contract, but bad things happen and this was one way in which we could get better despite the albatross contract."
"Yup, it was going to be a bad trade for the Celtics no matter what, so at least they got a serviceable Al Horford and a decent prospect in Moses Brown"
"""You could not live with your own failure.Where did that bring you? Back to me.""  - Al Horford, probably"
"It‚Äôs a shame. Kemba is a great dude by all accounts. He‚Äôs also a really solid player when healthy. I don‚Äôt know if Brad Steven‚Äôs first move as gm should have been to signal to the league that they will continue to be ruthless a la Ainge. Players had made it pretty clear that they didn‚Äôt appreciate that approach when it came to free agency. If he had picked up something worthwhile, maybe, but is Al Horford at this age really going to be the game changer? Full disclosure, I don‚Äôt know a ton about Moses Brown."
Al Horford is washed and we just lost the 16th pick just to dump Kemba. His contract is bad but this trade just added gasoline to the dumpster fire. Brad Stevens needs to go.
"They had Al Horford, They just sacrificed a young first rounder for an older Center with no athletic ability left. Kemba is not what he used to be but that first rounder will hurt."
"Are you kidding Al Horford had the least amount of turnovers per game of his career, and his highest 3PAr, whatever the fuck that means."
Kemba Walker and a 1st for Al Horford and Moses Brown? Guess Boston really liked Al.
They said this about both Chris Paul and Al Horford
So they‚Äôre getting Al Horford back? Kemba getting traded for a Reverse Uno card?!
I really dont think 35 year old Al Horford is a better basketball player than Kemba Walker and I dont think saving the extra $$ on guys who both have 2 yrs left is worth giving up the 16th overall pick in a decent draft. Horford also means you either move Robert Williams to the bench or have to play a Robert Williams/Horford front line major minutes. That or move Horford to the bench which is perhaps the best option. This is purely about saving $$ not about making Boston a better basketball team.
"Burying this comment here for posterity.  My suspicion is that the Clips gave Luke Kennard the extension because they needed a tradeable contract down the road.  The Clips are over the cap.  They're limited in the ways that they can acquire significant talent.  One way is to take on other team's unwanted contracts like they did with Rondo.  You need tradeable contracts for that.  One example of a move that could be made possible by Kennard's contract is Patrick Beverley, Luke Kennard, and the player taken with the 25th pick in the 2021 draft for Al Horford.  The salaries match.  There's a chance the Clips won't have Nic Batum and/or Serge Ibaka next season.  Both can become unrestricted free agents after this season and Serge could possibly miss time due to his health.  Al Horford could slot in neatly as a PF/C who could start or come off the bench at either position, provide shooting, passing, and defense.  The structure of Kennard's contract and the incentive language basically makes it a 3 year $43 mil contract for a team like OKC.  It's not that bad for player who can get his own shot and hit over 40% of his 3s as long as you don't need him to play defense.  His defensive limitations make him a bad fit for teams with championship aspirations but he's a good fit for a rebuilding team that doesn't expect to make deep playoff runs right away."
For this season  PG Wall  SG Klay  SF Love  PF Detroit's Blake Griffin   C Al Horford
Wall at PG with a super max  Klove at SF  Bertans at PF  Al Horford at center  And Kristof at SG
Did he play 10 games vs us this season?  I dont care about him cooking al horford. Sixers will stomp the nets if the bucks dont
How do you have all those stars in there and randomly think about Al Horford
"Yeah for real. It‚Äôs probably because of the Achilles injury for Kobe, but from what I‚Äôve seen when I started watching basketball, Kobe was far and away the better player than Duncan from 2006-2013 up until his Achilles injury. Duncan winning a ring as a role player in 2014 really changed people‚Äôs minds/perceptions about him in the debate.   Duncan was basically Al Horford for the last 8-9 years of his career"
"&gt;Plenty of dudes, like Al Horford, that don‚Äôt get those minutes.  Rebuilding != tanking.  Sacramento was trying to win, and Bjelica wasn't good enough to help."
imagine comparing Al Horford to Giannis or Russ lol
You can just stagger Al Horford and Embiid!
Last year Al Horford would have attempted what Danny Green just did
Al Horford in shambles..
"I mean yeah, they‚Äôre rebuilding. Plenty of dudes, like Al Horford, that don‚Äôt get those minutes."
He didn't even play in the playoffs his first season in Boston and Al Horford was our best player for Kyrie's two years here even when he was healthy. The team always took a nose dive as soon as Al came off the court but did fine without Kyrie.
I actually think Ayton reminds me a lot of early Al Horford. Intelligent and good both sides of the ball but not elite (and never a 20+ ppg scorer). Al Horford also was actually one of the few people I have found that is also pretty bad at getting to the free throw line like Ayton is as well. Ayton plays like an undersized center and not like the athletic freak that he is.
"wana take him for Al Horford? please, im begging you okc"
people said the same about Al horford.
I could see OKC taking the contract in a swap for Al Horford. I don't see Dallas doing that though.
"Nah, if you are going to take potentially washed old dudes, you trade him for Al Horford with OKC"
Rookie Al Horford took an even better Boston team to 7 games the year before Rose was drafted too. It's not just MVP level players who rise.
CJ for Al Horford or lonzo ball?
There is no world. Absolutely no world where Al Horford is a better asset than KP to the point that a pick has to also be thrown in. You are either joking or you are a total idiot and I am saying this as an OKC fan who likes Horford and thinks he looked better than I expected.
Al Horford
It‚Äôs straight up KP and pick for Al Horford lmao
Al Horford
1. KLove 2. Bertans 3. Hayward 4. Al Horford 5. KP  Lmao I'm noticing a general trend here.
I guess you could get Al Horford
"Schroder also continues the age old tradition of former hawks players balling out for other teams in the playoffs: Jason terry, al horford, and Kyle Korver all day Hi."
"His value is from his expiring contract. Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs $14 million. Combine it with someone‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say Marcus Morris, you have a tradable salary of $28 million.   The clippers can roll the dice with Al Horford. Clippers have their big man, thunder can showcase Morris to flip him for another FRP."
"[15th if you don't count any metros in Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_statistical_areas) (Toronto is way bigger).  Anything outside of top 4 or 5 is treated as small market, except for Miami. This is extremely fluid and depends on who's making what point, but Atlanta and Detroit are both bigger metros than Seattle. Neither is treated like a big market...Atlanta even goes for hometown discounts on guys like Lou Will.  Even Philly (6th biggest city, 8th biggest metro) is treated as small market during free agency ever year. Our only big free agent signing of the past decade was a washed up Al Horford, and that was a fucking mess."
"Well Al Horford was great for them. Hayward snapped his fucking leg in half. Kyrie....well that just didn‚Äôt work, and Kemba was predictable. He came from Charlotte and was the scorer on a fringe playoff team with little pressure or attention and got thrown into Boston where the two young guys are better."
"Just went through basketball reference. The only notable players with number 15 any time in their career are/were:   Vince Carter   Boogie   Kemba   Ron Artest   Al Horford     I'd say Vince in his prime is better, and Boogie in his prime is close to Jokiƒá"
"al horford will magically not be old next season, presumably, whatever that's worth."
"You‚Äôre saying you think the East was better then the West lol? AD was going up against peak warriors, Giannis was going up against Al Horford."
"Yes lol. All-Stars are stars by definition. There not superstars, but definitely stars. Al Horford was definitely a star during his Hawks years. He's not a star anymore tho."
"I wouldn't really say all-star = star.  Al Horford was a multi time all star and a very solid play, but would you have ever considered him a ""star""?"
"...i mean y‚Äôall got swept in that ECF, the first one seed to get swept in over a decade.  Nobody talks about the 67 win Spurs team from 2016 be caused they underwhelmed in the playoffs But imo the biggest reason y‚Äôall‚Äôs great season is kinda forgotten about was that the Hawks least ‚Äòstar power‚Äô of any good team in recent memory.  Prime Al Horford was a beast, but he‚Äôs not exactly ‚Äòface of the franchise‚Äô material from a personality standpoint.  that team was proof that the whole is greater than the sum if it‚Äôs parts, and is the best team Budenholzer has ever put together.  And i‚Äôm not saying this just to shit in your coffee, I was pulling hard for the hawks to beat the Cavs that year because I was tired of people calling them paper tigers"
"they had plenty of leverage;  Harden's much older than any other recent superstar who has requested out, and was still under contract for years (whoever signs his next contract is really gonna regret it).  His prime will most likely be over by the time he's a free agent.  They absolutely should have waited to get more (or just given him the Al Horford treatment), but post-Morey they're a bad organization"
Al horford and Paul milsap I believe were in the same situation: get a fat pay day for a year or get a longer but safer deal. Both opted out
"I had to google it because I know there have been a few, but apparently the first was Tito Horford (Al Horfords father), in 1966."
Al Horford is from the DR.
"Nope, Al Horford was born in DR."
"Al Horford also implied that Kyrie was the problem in his first Sixers presser. He said that he would've wanted to stay had he known that we were getting Kemba, but said that he didn't think it would work out/been the same had Kyrie stayed.  We also literally saw him being a bad teammate on live TV and in press conferences lol."
"&gt; I think its pretty fair to say they are in much worse shape now than when morey came aboard  What? Last year they were the 6th seed, swept in the first round and paying $25 million a year to Al Horford. One year with him there they were first in the east *because* of those ""fringe moves."""
how hilarious would it be that in the 2019 off season Philly signs Al Horford and Boston signs Kemba Walker only for Al Horford to end up in Boston by way of OKC and for Kemba to end up in Philly by way of OKC  why did Boston let Al Horford go again
"OH, UMM, WHERE'S ALL THE FOLKS IN THE PAST 12 HOURS ACTING LIKE US THUNDER FANS ARE HOMERS???  I hate this shit as it happens ALL THE TIME. Random Bleacher Report guy from out the fucking blue just spouts out some random shit and before folks can dig into it the shit becomes a damn wildfire. Then it stays a wildfire as a bunch of blogs will pick up the Bleacher Report bullshit. Next thing you know it's something that can't be unseen. Not just the Thunder either as I just saw it regarding a Rockets report regarding Mobley. The Rockets aren't even looking his way...OF COURSE MOBLEY IS GOING TO ACT LIKE HE DON'T WANT TO PLAY THERE!!!  We told your ass that Presti and Weaver (....who used to be in the Thunder FO) basically speak in codes regarding EVERYTHING. Historically if there's a report about the Thunder, and it didn't get funneled through Woj, Sham, or a few of its local journalists (Royce Young would always magically know finite details about some shit that nobody else knew about), IT'S FALSE.   When WOJ, who fucking profiled Presti in that hand job piece a few years ago between the two of them, reports some shit....I'll listen. Just like ALL the Woj shit that has been reported. Until then, fake news fake news fake news. SGA is going to get that bag as it's common sense for him to get that bag.   &gt; Well does he fit the timeline....  Stop with your newfound vernacular. Cade is what SGA is right now, just that SGA is 23. Dude isn't 27/28. He's YOUNG. If he didn't get injured just like Al Horford said the Thunder would have let them boys run towards the play-in game. Think about that! What Al gotta lie about? if the Thunder didn't want to tank until they best player got a Durant-style injury then why would they tank this year?  It's disgusting folks each that bleeding rag of the Bleacher Report."
We also thought Al Horford would fit in well
with the 2nd best player on the team being Al Horford who played 28 games
Al Horford and picks
"They got an unproven talent, which they turned into Paul George, which they turned into a massive pile of assets to build a great team. They also happened to get Al Horford along the way"
Not really a quirk but Al Horford physically dodging bricks always gives me a chuckle.
"This is not even close to true. To try and get KD stay, we were about to sign al Horford. We paid victor oladipo. We overpaid Steven Adams. We paid Paul George. We paid Russel westbrook. We paid Carmelo. We were in the luxury tax for years after KD left."
His arbitrage to pick up all these extra assets has been extremely impressive. He got 2 picks and 2 swaps to take on CP3‚Äôs contract and got another pick sending him away. Same with Al Horford. That has been insanely impressive.
"Yes, he‚Äôs an al horford type.  But he‚Äôs not a Marc gasol type like al horford is, if you catch my drift"
"Morey got rid of the Al Horford contract after 1 season and traded Josh Richardson for 3 years of prime Seth Curry. He also acquired Harden in Houston in the first place. And Chris Paul. And Dwight Howard. And Russell Westbrook. Sure Harden and CP3 were the reasons the team challenged that KD-era Warriors, but Morey built it."
I think JV is a an Al Horford type..?
isn't Turner more or less an Al Horford type?
For real. Lowkey the perfect center for New Orleans would be an Al Horford type.
can confirm  we signed Al Horford and traded Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson to piss off Embiid.  Also let JJ walk  It's a miracle he hasn't asked out already.
"People forget that the Suns acquired a protected pick in the Hawks trade that became Al Horford.  I can‚Äôt remember the specifics of the deal, but I believe the Suns would have kept the pick if it fell below #3.  They reportedly wanted Conley."
Al Horford?
I thought this meant Al Horford at first
"KAT and AD, Drummond, and al horford lol"
"Excuse me, they actually went to 7 against an 8th seed Atlanta team WITH a rookie Al Horford and Zaza. That doesnt sound like a team that ""sucks"" to me"
"just sit him until some team needs to dump a bad contract, see Al Horford."
"&gt;snd got swept the first round  Wrong, they took the Josh Smith/Joe Johnson/Al Horford/Mike Bibby Hawks to 7 games"
"The Celtics would actually lose *more* players if they wait to get him in free agency.   If the Celtics trade for Beal right now, they can conceivably re-sign Evan Fournier and keep Al Horford in addition to Beal/Tatum/Brown.    Signing Beal in free agency next year means trading Fournier for no salary back, waiving and stretching Horford, letting Smart walk for nothing etc in order to clear cap space. All they're really saving is some picks.    The best way for the Celtics to build an immediate winner is to trade for Beal right now."
Or how about Romeo langford + al horford and 4 1 st and maybe a bag of chips
"This is a great question.  I'll keep my answers to current players.  Players I'd take over Cade is Bam Adebayo (this assumes Bam doesn't get significantly better otherwise it would be an easy decision).  He isn't an all-nba level player but his defensive versatility and skillset is very rare and valuable in todays game.  Klay Thompson and Al Horford would also be my other choices.  I'd take Cade's potential over all-stars Draymond, Ingram, Derozan and Oladipo."
I have always believed Embiid and Simmons together isn't perfect but you can work around it by getting shooters and playmakers around them. Instead our FO's next decisions were to max Tobias Harris and throw $25M at Al Horford. It's a shame we'll never know what an Embiid/Simmons pairing surrounded by shooters and playmakers would look like.
Al horford isnt known as a prolific scorer so i‚Äôd list him here  Michael Carter Williams if a sleeper pick
"On the opposite side, Ben Gordon and Al Horford would get blocked 10 times a game."
Because the team was mediocre/bad for a long time. The fact that Trae already led the team on their deepest postseason run in the city's history says a lot.   You aren't selling stars on coming to play with Joe Johnson and Al Horford in any city.  ---------  You implying there are a bunch behind-the-scenes reasons without saying anything is pretty silly.
"&gt;I mean Trae was drafted.   I'm saying he's already the most appealing player to play with that ATL has had in my lifetime. Even if you live in an appealing city, telling someone to hitch their cart to Joe Johnson or Al Horford isn't persuasive.   &gt; And the knicks were in the conversation  ""In the conversation"" is a pretty random bar. They didn't actually go there, that's all that matters. How close/far they were to going there isn't something we have any meaningful knowledge about.  &gt;I don‚Äôt see how they would be trying to lure these superstars right now anyways.  There are almost no superstars to lure lol, the only one hitting the market is Kawhi, and he's injured and 99% staying in LA."
"Trae is already the biggest star that the Hawks have had in my lifetime. You might as well say the Knicks can't get FAs either. Obviously, when a team is bad/not convincing a la old Knicks and Joe Johnson/Al Horford-era Hawks, you're not going to pull FAs."
And Al Horford instead of Tatum
We had an agreement to sign Al Horford. However KD left that summer and Horford signed elsewhere. Front office was committed we just had shit luck with major injuries in the playoffs.
"It‚Äôs arguable that Curry was better in 2017 postseason.   Duncan and Parker were better than Kawhi in 2014, Kawhi was an excellent role player  Al Horford actually was the best player on the team in 2018 for the Celtics, much better than Tatum or Brown"
Paul Milsap should be there instead of al horford
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"
Couple of weeks ago when the Celtics traded Kemba for Al Horford
Are you talking about Jeff Teague and Al Horford?
Al Horford was probably the best player on the ‚Äò18 Celtics. So I‚Äôd put him at 7 game ECF and Jayson Tatum down for last year which was 6 game ECF
"1.	Before that PG trade, people doubted Kawhi to LAC since they didn‚Äôt have another star. Very slick by LAC. 2.	I badly want to know what RDA said to any Reddit mods to gain legitimacy. Seemed they just made vague enough predictions that would come true (e.g. Al Horford will leave Boston, then he went to Philly‚Ä¶ well of course, he wasn‚Äôt happy about how the team did). Then RDA got bold and made the Kawhi prediction before getting burned."
Kemba to the thunder for Al Horford. It‚Äôs already happened baby
They literally were up 3-1 on us. And would've gotten BETTER with Al Horford if KD had stayed.
He probably could have stayed in OKC and won. They would have gotten Al Horford the next season and still had the assets the used to trade for PG.
Al Horford got 20 and people were like ehhh ok and theoretically norm should be better suited for his position than Al was for the 4
Al Horford though...
Remember when Celtics fans threw a party when the corpse of Al Horford came back
"Honestly I really cant say who goes to the bench out of those two. Wendell is so damn consistent. The dude just puts in work every day. The Al Horford comparisons were really spot on, especially early on in Horfords career. Just so fundamentally sound and strong around the post, a player who can play both the 4 and 5 like a true old school big, but also has a nice 3 point shot. Bamba's ceiling is so high but I prefer having one player in the lineup who provides that steady baseline.  And honestly lets be real, we have no idea when JI will be back, how much minutes he will be able to play and what his effectiveness will be. He's gonna be coming off the bench on limited minutes for at least a good month even when he returns. So at least Mosley has time to figure out what he's got at the 5 and 4 spots."
"Don't tell Celtics fans that. People really thought we were better than last year because ""we brought back Al Horford and got Josh Richardson!"""
&gt;Edit: I personally think they need a veteran star to lead them  I don‚Äôt think Al Horford is a young player
"Older Al Horford might be our second best player, which is troubling"
"I mean you guys went from players like Kyrie, Hayward, Rozier, and younger Al Horford to Dennis, Josh Richardson, and older Al Horford."
What potential? People seriously thought 35 years old Al Horford and Josh Richardson who has been bad for two seasons were going to save this team?
Celtics good: Al Horford looks as good at 35 as he did at 31.  Celtics bad: Al Horford at 31 played like a 35 year old.
Al Horford is the ultimate glue guy.
"And then as we all know Stevens attached a first to get off Kemba's contract for an overpaid Al Horford. I still think it's kind of funny that Boston didn't want to give Horford the bag and now Horford's back on the Celtics.  Also I'm pretty sure that 2020 protected first was Desmond Bane LMAO.  You can't blame Ainge for when Hayward snapped his ankle but he did sit on his assets for a lot longer than he should have. Hopefully Presti uses the Ainge tenure as an example of what not to do, even if that means having to grease your transactions with extra picks to make them go through."
Replacing key players with the shell of Al horford and Dennis shcroeder.
I honestly think it'd be better for team if they just sent him home like what was done for John Wall and Al Horford.  Dude's got a ring and now he just wants the bag he signed for. If he doesn't want a buyout then let him stay away from the team to prevent any issues from occurring.
"Al Horford is averaging 13 11 and 3. He‚Äôs playing well, if not better than when he played for Boston the first go round (best averages were 14, 7, and 5) and he‚Äôs been solid defensively. The season is young like you said, I think it‚Äôs just gonna take a couple weeks for everyone to get healthy until the rotations are there."
"I think Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, and Tim Duncan, were all clearly better than him that whole time, and you could make an argument for Al Horford, Joakim Noah, and DeAndre Jordan too. Towards the tail-end of that time-frame, Anthony Davis and Rudy Gobert also surpassed him."
I‚Äôve always thought Al Horford had a game that would age really well
"I don't think they did that bad this off-season. They got a bench which is more than they could say last season. I'd probably taken a PG instead of Al Horford but the roster is much better than last year. Whereas the Mavs got Reggie Bullock, Sterling Brown, Moses Brown and that's about it."
Think he has potential to make a few all stars. Reminds me a lot of Al Horford. Not in terms of play style but Swiss army type guys who are good at everything without being great and anything
"2 players that were in the 3 point contest last year, Al Horford who‚Äôs a top 5 shooter at the center position, Grant Williams who‚Äôs a great shooter, and Schr√∂der?  Idk but to me that should be a pretty great shooting lineup"
I was low on the Celtics since the off-season. People were telling me they were going to contend for the 3-seed. This roster just doesn‚Äôt work. They need a real point guard and can‚Äôt have their 3rd best player be a 35 year old Al Horford.
TIL Al Horford is on the Celtics
"Lol you and I have very different ideas of a good offseason  Kemba, Tristan Thompson, and Evan Fournier &gt; al horford, Kanter, and Schroder seems like a lateral move at best to me"
Wizards vs an Al Horford Celtics team? We‚Äôre back in 2017
"It‚Äôs exactly what we wanted they swallowed their whistle literally the play prior, Al horford charged on diniwidde and they let them play; even as a wiz fan I love the no calls"
The charge Al Horford had on Dinniwidde; even the Boston announcers thought it was a fouk
Al Horford looks cooked in OT
i know Al Horford gonna feel this in the morning
i just looked at the box score and old man washed al horford has six blocks JESUS i love al
Al Horford is such a difference maker
"al horford showing his age on that play, can't stay in front of dinwiddie at all"
What sources?  ‚ÄúBoston may also be without big man Al Horford for the team‚Äôs regular season opener as he awaits clearance from the NBA health and safety protocols after a positive COVID-19 test earlier this week. Jaylen Brown is expected to be cleared in time to play next Wednesday after testing positive for COVID-19 last Friday. League sources indicated to MassLive.com that both Horford and Brown suffered breakthrough cases and are vaccinated.‚Äù  The link doesn‚Äôt lead to anything related to any sources.
"It was kinda weird when every article would say ""Jaylen Brown and Al Horford  caught Covid-19. Ime Udoka had a breakthrough case."""
"Celtics' Al Horford tests positive for COVID-19 days after Jaylen Brown, per report  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/celtics-al-horford-tests-positive-for-covid-19-days-after-jaylen-brown-per-report/"
Ya we have actual basketball players on the bench now. Plus al horford was a serious need.      not saying they are good. Just better than last year. Hopefully new coach will do better tho
"If you put the Sixers in that list of contenders, by the same measure you would have to put the Raptors of recent. They were top 3 seed for years, reached the top seed once and made it further even before Kawhi.  Horford Hawks the same. They were continuously middle of the pack teams drawing the same criticisms, then finally had a year where they won 60 games and also reached the ECF which is more success than either the Sixers or Jazz. They didn't tank to get to their Al/Millsap/Korver/Teague core."
Imagine being such a negative asset that trading you and picks for Al Horford is a good deal lmao
I don't think it's a coincidence Brad's first move was to get Al Horford back.  Al hasn't played well since he left and neither has Boston for the most part.  Kemba should have had some trade interest from other teams in the league I think.
Remember when al horford played for the celtics? Pepp.. Wait what is this trade?
"Al Horford also has 3 years left, it changes nothing"
The return of Celtics legend Al Horford!
OKC about to cash in on Zion with all of these picks ‚ò†Ô∏è  Presti got Al Horford for draft capital and then proceeded to trade him for Kemba and even MORE draft capital. This man is collecting draft picks like rare Pokemon cards.
Acting like Al Horford had a career year  I'll give you CP3 tho
"The fuck are you doing, Brad? Why in the world should we want Al Horford back?"
moses brown and al horford
Go back and see what everyone thought of al horford and cp3 before they went on the thunder
Al Horford
"Why are we having this conversation? Does anyone pay attention at all? Kemba has tendinitis in his right knee, that‚Äôs not gonna get better with time. To get off his contract they were always gonna have to attach a first, plus al knows the system and our team has always played better with a playmaker at the 5, which horford is"
lol Al Horford
"The fuck? This trade is trash for the Celtics? Was Kemba that much of a liability that this is the best they can do? Al Horford is another year older. He's 35. Moses Brown is a decent prospect, but Celtics already have Robert Williams who was finally starting to develop at the tail end of the season. You give up the 16th pick in a deep draft. Someone please explain what the fuck is going on?"
[AL HORFORD CELTICS JERSEY PHOTOSHOP ](https://images.app.goo.gl/FNb6Y2srZPWbFW7L8)
Always have wanted to see what Al Horford would look like in a celtics jersey
Is Kemba really that bad now? They‚Äôd prefer to have a 35 year old Al Horford who played 28 games and they gave up a first round pick?
Do they know Al Horford is 35?
celtics legend al horford
Presti just absolutely swindled Brad   He‚Äôs gonna recoup Kemba‚Äôs value and trade him off for more picks just like CP and now Al Horford
"Al Horford is a solid player, but still a hilariously bad trade for the Celtics."
"Beautiful (Pure shooters form) - Klay, Joe Harris, Buddy Hield  Unconventional but Hella Smooth - Melo, KD, Zach  Fugly - Draymond(form looks like your shooting with a backpack on), Al Horford. Is MKG still considered as active since he was just waived last December?"
Is Al Horford still in the NBA. His shot is the worst but goes in.
"there will be so many bad contracts offered by GMs for free  like Porzingis, John Wall, Kemba, Al Horford, Wiggins. Basically it will be an opportunity for GMs to offload some of their mistakes to a new team looking for a fresh start."
"Only one time as the best player, Al Horford was their best player in the 2018 run"
"I don't think Al horford moves the needle. Horford, Kanter, and Adams is a really crowded frontcourt especially for an NBA that was about to radically downsize the next 5 years. Their only hope would have been moving Kanter for a Danny Green type so they didnt have to give 30+ minutes to Roberson"
"That was also 4 years prior? With LeBron on the Miami Heat. If he would have stayed, he would have gotten al horford anyway. That's enough to try to run it back."
Do you even watch basketball? Lmao  The Mavs would be lucky to get Al Horford and a new washing machine for KP right now.
Could've just gone to the Celtics then. Made it so LeBron couldn't get out of the East and he had a chance to redeem against the warriors. Or stay in okc and gain al horford
"Al horford was on adams team tho.  Decent defender that can shoot &amp; great passer.  I don‚Äôt know what griffin was thinking.  Also, griff wasted the 10th pick on a non shooting big to pair with Zion.  Teams that don‚Äôt value spacing don‚Äôt do well."
"David Griffin really ducked up and it was honestly obvious at the time. Bledsoe i actually thought would be good, but Steven Adams was so clearly not the move, and the move was Al Horford, who was literally on the same team they traded with"
"I still hold that they should have found a way to take back Al Horford instead of also giving up George Hill and taking on Bledsoe/Adams. Hill and Horford are both veterans who would have been great for the locker room after their terrible showing in the bubble. Horford isn't a very good rebounder but he can still play next to Zion, be a solid defender, can make the right pass and stretch the floor on offense, and just generally plays mistake-free basketball. Hill's a much better shooter than Bledsoe and doesn't hold onto the ball nearly as much. They would have been perfect fits for this roster and actually would have been better for them cap-wise too."
"His current level isn‚Äôt anywhere near enough to help his resume though. He‚Äôs not even a starter. He hasn‚Äôt started more than 1/3 of his games since 16-17. Just being a starter your whole career and having a few all stars isn‚Äôt even enough to make the hall. Example Al Horford. Only didn‚Äôt start 10 games over his 881 games, 4x all star, nowhere close to the hall."
"Boston has attracted more highly compensated UFAs from other teams than any other team since 2015.   Al Horford in 2016, Gordon Hayward in 2017 and Kemba Walker in 2019. Kyrie was traded. That is three unique UFA signings.  GSW has 5 big dollar UFA signings, but four of them were already with the team. Cleveland had three, with all of them being resignings (Lebron, Lebron and Love). Dallas got DeAndre Jordon twice somehow according to my data, and resigned Nowitzki in 2016. Miami signed Butler, and resigned Whiteside and Wade. Brooklyn got Kyrie and KD, and resigned Brook Lopez. Toronto resigned FVV, Lowry and Derozan.   Three other teams had 2 big salary UFAs, 12 teams had one, and 8 had none."
"This shit goes both ways though so I don't really care anymore. Blake for example signed a huge deal with the Clippers, was told he was their franchise player and would be there for a long time, and then got traded to a random lottery team weeks later. OKC just sent Al Horford home this season rather than play him. IT got traded after playing hurt for the Celtics when his sister had just died. Teams are always looking out for their best interest, so why would we be upset when players do the same thing when they have a bit of leverage to do so."
That isn't the case at all. Look at Al Horford
Al horford for Simmons straight up who says no
"I mean, I know it's not really the same, but they did have 4 all stars that one year. Daddy Millsap, Al Horford (who was THE star, if we are being honest), Kyle mothafuckin' Korver and Jeff Teague.   They were scary on the regular season, and if it werent LeBron, they would easily come off the East. But Millsap' LeBron curse is real.  Also Joe Johnson was big on Hawks, wasn't he?"
"You clearly don‚Äôt watch the Celtics. Al Horford hasn‚Äôt been on our team for two seasons. Romeo played in 11 games that Jaylen did, Rob Williams played low minutes until the trade deadline and then got injured not too long after.   Our defense as a whole sucked and we had 37 different starting lineups. It‚Äôs very hard to build defensive chemistry and defensive mistakes all around become more frequent when you‚Äôre starting guys like Tremont Waters, Javonte Greene, Grant Williams, Semi, Wagner, Carsen Edwards, and Kornet.  He‚Äôs been a good defender in a higher stakes setting of the playoffs. In the last two years he‚Äôs had a better dbpm than Steph, Capela, Paul George, Gobert, Middleton, and Klay. He had more defensive wins last year than Butler or Bam despite playing fewer minutes and games. Jaylen has flaws on defense but I think you‚Äôre going too far."
