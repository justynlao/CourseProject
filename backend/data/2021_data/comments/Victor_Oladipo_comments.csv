"The Golden State Warriors reportedly have interest in a trade for Victor Oladipo, according to Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer.  O'Connor noted this shows the team's plans to add another ball-handler in the mold of Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston, who each played key roles during the team's three NBA titles.  Oladipo has appeared in 15 games with the Houston Rockets since coming over in a January trade from the Indiana Pacers, averaging 19.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists with his new team.  The 28-year-old is set to become a free agent in the offseason.  Several big names have already changed teams this season, including James Harden heading to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a blockbuster four-team deal and Derrick Rose returning to the New York Knicks from the Detroit Pistons.   The Pistons are keeping Blake Griffin on the bench for the time being as they continue to explore trade opportunities for the six-time All-Star. The Cleveland Cavaliers are also holding Andre Drummond out of games in hopes of dealing him.   Teams will try to pursue other impact players such as Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine ahead of the March 25 deadline, while a young playmaker like Lonzo Ball or veteran role players like JJ Redick, George Hill and P.J. Tucker could all be on the move to help contenders.  For more NBA coverage, check out B/R's surprise landing spots for the league's top trade targets.

Advances defensive statistics are notoriously unreliable. Julius Randle and Victor Oladipo are both in the top 10 in defensive win shares for example.
"Interestingly, the dunk contest has a history of catching a lot of players before their true ascent into super stardom, so it creates this perpetual cycle where it feels like there’s no stars entering each year only to look back in hindsight and realize there’s names everywhere.   Just in the last 10 years or so, all-star caliber contestants have included Dwight Howard, Zach LaVine, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo, John Wall, Mason Plumlee, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Serge Ibaka, and Blake Griffin."

"I think victor oladipo might be a decent get, but doubt he resigns after the year."
I just saw some guy say Victor Oladipo should sign for the minimum next year to join the Heat lol.

"Heat/Rockets trade idea:  Heat get: Victor Oladipo, PJ Tucker, Roddy Kurucs  Rockets get: Olynyk, Leonard, Precious, Avery Bradley  Heat have limited upside to improve their roster and I think one of the only ways they can make something happen is taking a gamble on Victor Oladipo (who has made it apparent that he wants to be in Miami).  So the Heat leverage that desire to get him for pennies on the dollar essentially - Olynyk is an expiring and Leonard has a team option for next season. On top of that, the Heat look to boost their depth at the 4 with PJ and taking another gamble on Roddy Kurucs.  Precious is the true asset that the Rockets get back. This trade may gut the center depth on the Heat too much and they may look to replace Precious with someone like Kendrick Nunn but I figured he has less value as a RFA. Thoughts?"
"I think Orlando is an even better example at how hard it is to pick outside of the top-2, even if you have a high pick:        2013: Victor Oladipo #2 overall (not bad, but traded him before he broke out)       2014: Aaron Gordon #4 overall         2015: Mario Hezonja #5 overall         2016: Domantas Sabonis #11 overall (traded to OKC)               2017:  Jonathan Isaac #6 overall           2018: Mo Bamba #6 overall"

"Victor Oladipo, the 8th pick(Sabonis) and Ersan(later traded for Jerami Grant) for Serge Ibaka was worse."
Literally anyone except Victor Oladipo because he has the most aesthetically pleasing nose in the NBA.    All other noses are garbage. Get rid of them.
Bruh they didnt want Ben Simmons over Victor Oladipo and some shitty picks. You know they wont take our offer unless it's a robbery. Fertita would never want Morey to succeed and trading Harden easily makes us title favorites.

Demar Derozan and Jakob Poetl. Or fat Victor Oladipo and rookie Sabonis. Or Al Jefferson and Theo Ratliff's expiring contract. Or Vin Baker.
To be fair the entire MIP thing is broken.   The moment Victor Oladipo won it in 2017-18 it was proven how much of a joke the award was.   Somehow a 2nd Overall Pick living up to his expectations is all of a sudden “Most Improved Player”. Dude was already on his 2nd Contract making like $22m a year just slightly below the Max $.   Then you had someone like Spencer Dinwiddie who went from NBA wash out playing in the G-League to putting up quality numbers after looking like a complete bum the year before when fans were calling him Dimwittie for his foolish mistakes.    Then the excuse was that Oladipo’s team had a better record and he made the All Star game. All of a sudden those exact same standards don’t apply the following season for D’Angelo Russell.
"Nah players are still selected even if voting happens after injury. See Victor Oladipo for example, who Dlo replaced."
"It's gonna be a bad class. The only reason teams were clearing space was for Giannis but now that he got his supermax the best available players are Victor Oladipo, Otto Porter Jr and DeMar DeRozan"
"Garbage team with garbage players such as, *checks notes*, Victor Oladipo, Steven Adams, Andre Robertson (one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA before he died or whatever happened to him), Jerami Grant, Sabonis, Enes Kanter. Adams and Kanter were at their peaks. The rest were obviously not as good as they are now, Sabonis in particular was basically a scrub, but they also improved significantly once leaving WB's shadow, Oladipo immediately so. I'd argue playing with him made them look worse than they actually were because the offense was all about WB, all the time. What he accomplished that season was impressive, but basketball is about winning championships, not dragging people to the first round before promptly getting your ass kicked by a Houston team with the guy you beat for MVP surrounded by a slightly better roster. As for Steve Kerr, yes, I'll give you that one but WB has proven that he's not quite the most coachable fellow in the league. I don't want to take away from that point tho because it was super impressive what WB did. It just wasn't championship-level good. Personally, I didn't think he deserved the MVP that year, Harden did. And since then, triple doubles have become mundane, which kind of takes the shine off what he accomplished because to me, it's clear it's as much a factor of the insane pace of the league nowadays as it is a testament to his greatness (which it still is, don't get me wrong).  As for the efficiency argument, yeah, you're right. It's not the end all be all. However, it is when you have two guys averaging about the same amount of points, lol. Please don't tell me you really believe that Westbrook was ever close to Steph on that front, it will break my heart how far education standards have fallen if I need to explain why a guy who regularly flirts with 50/40/90 is better that a guy who never got past 35% from deep. I think you're too smart for that, nobody who could read my smug, annoying arguments and keep going could be otherwise.  We are literally watching Steph play on an equivalent or worse team than that OKC squad and average numbers equal to the greatest offensive season of all time. He is clearly miles ahead of Westbrook. The only reason it might have been kind of close if you make really charitable arguments and ignore the eye test was when Steph first had trouble playing next to KD. But he finished that season tearing through the Western Conference and the playoffs. Yeah he had a better team. Now he has a much worse team than before and he's playing just as good. Yes, he is in fact dragging a sorry-ass team the same way WB did. Have you seen Dray's numbers this year? Only difference is Steph's doing it on a minutes restriction. Anyways, sorry for yelling."
&gt;win now   &gt;victor oladipo   Unless thibs has a time machine to go get 2011 rose and 2018 dipo he’s not winning now lol
Where were you when you heard the Knicks traded a bunch of garbage for Victor Oladipo? I know I will remember
"Basically three issues all at once: there is a Victor Oladipo sized hole in the offense. The entire offense at this point is Sabonis and Brogdon, and Brogdon is in a shooting slump, and finally we are without T.J Warren and the guy we got for Oladipo (LeVert) literally has cancer.  We are cursed"

Exactly. So with Pat Bev and Lou together they could bring back around $26m in salary. How do you do that in a way that improves the team?  Victor Oladipo? Buddy Hield? Harrison Barnes? Malcolm Borgden? Zach Lavine?  It seems like only if Houston's cash-squeezed is there any reason to think a deal of one of those guys for Bev/Lou makes any sense for the other team.
"""Get off me, he says to Victor Oladipo"""
Chris Paul Victor Oladipo Jimmy Butler Kristaps Porzingis Rudy Gobert
"And those types of systems work really well with a cast of veterans, but young guys don't develop well. Look at how Jerami Grant, Domas, Victor Oladipo, etc blossomed after leaving the thunder. And we can do this case study with any high usage, ball dominant star, this usually happens. It's not russ slander, but he's an awful fit for this team imo. I would much rather have a veteran PG like D Rose because young talent can still flourish, and that's what the Wiz need"
Victor Oladipo in shambles
Bulls? Pacers? Teams with one offensive option come crunch time? Yeah sure. The Celtics were the only team with a true chance of beating the Heat with their roster till 2014. Let's not even talk about the field for the 4 years after that. The two best players LeBron faced in 2018 were Jayson Tatum and Victor Oladipo.
"&gt;Clearly stars are irrelevant.  I think this is the wrong conclusion, tbh. What we should actually be drawing from this is that Victor Oladipo is as good as or better than James Harden."
"""I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep."" -Victor Oladipo, probably"
"Definitely, although that's totally irrelevant in that Victor Oladipo is assessed against equally talented/gifted basketball players."
I couldn’t think of two players with less in common than JJ watt and Victor Oladipo. They each got hurt before and used to play in Houston....cool I guess

Victor Oladipo is so overrated lmao
"I mean I guess you’re right. I just hope for the sake of your throat, the Lakers never sign Victor Oladipo."
"The good thing is ""that other guy who would get you stuck in the middle of the pack forever"" has a huge trade value, or at the very least higher than Victor Oladipo and Avery Bradley... and if you don't like a player you can always trade him to another team and get something in return.      The mental gymnastics some Rockets fans are going thru to not accept the fact that their franchise made one of the worst trades in recent history."
"I never said he is, but you didn’t get a franchise cornerstone guy instead of him. You got Victor Oladipo and ping pong balls."
"The Houston Rockets weren't even trying to tank at first. They had a time where they went 7 of 8 including wins against playoff teams and western rivals. Victor Oladipo was also a player that could help them stay competitive. Wood got injured so it didn't work out. The Oladipo trade received a lot of criticism but the Wall-Oladipo-Wood line-up was a winning line-up during the 5 games it existed prior to Wood's injury.  Houston technically could also keep their pick if they had a better record than the Heat (and don't move up), which they actually did until late February."

I thought this article did a great job of laying out expectation for Oladipo's ability to contribute in Miami:  https://premiumhoops.org/2021/03/28/context-and-circumstance-key-for-victor-oladipo-in-miami/
"Durant was in that rare case where the first pick was cursed, so he did fine. (See: Anthony Bennett, Victor Oladipo)."
"Long post incoming:   Wiseman's OBPM on the year is -4.3. His DBPM is -1.3. As a point of reference, Andris Biedrins in his final year with the Warriors had a -4.8 OBPM. Biedrins' TS% that year was 45%. Wiseman's this year is 55%. Despite being a far more efficient finisher, a 33% three point shooter and shooting 30 points better from the free throw line than Biedrins, Wiseman's offensive impact is only marginally better than later career Biedrins. That's um... really bad.  In the Kerr era Steph has only been a part of three two-man combos to play &gt;100 minutes with a negative net rating: Steph/Oubre -1.9, Steph/Varejao -6.6, and Steph/Wiseman -7.4. The ORTG of Steph/Wiseman is 102.8  In Steph's entire career, these are the negative net rating two-man combos he's been in that have received &gt;100 minutes . Steph/Oubre, Steph/Varejao (2015-16), Steph Wiseman, Steph/Festus (2012-13) Steph/Biedrins (2012-13), Steph/Steve Blake, Steph/Jordan Crawford, Steph/Klay (2011-12) , Steph/Biedrins (2011-12), Monta/Steph (2010-11), Steph/Reggie Williams (2010-11), Steph/Lou Admunson (2010-11), Steph/Biedrins (2010-11), Steph/Gadzuric (2010-11), Steph/Carney (2010-11) Steph/Turiaf (2009-10) Steph/Morrow (2009-10), Steph/S-Jax (2009-10), Steph/Chris Hunter (2009-10), Steph/Randolph, Steph/Biedrins (2009-10), Steph/William (2009-10)s, Steph/Maggette (2009-10), Steph/Randmonovic (2009-10), Monta/Steph (2009-10), Steph/Bukie (2009-10), Steph/Mikki Moore (2009-10)  In Steph's ENTIRE CAREER, only six two man-combos have performed worse than Steph/Wiseman:  Monta/Steph -8.0 (2009-10) Steph/Gadzuric -8.8 (2010-11) Steph/Carney -10.5 (2010-11) Curry/Crawford -11.8 (2013-14) Steph/Bukie -14.0 (2009-10) Steph/Mikki Moore -20.8 (2009-10)  You'll notice that three of those two man combos are from when Steph was a rookie and wasn't STEPH F'n CURRY. The other three players Gadzuric, Carney, and Crawford, literally never played another NBA game after their seasons with the Warriors. So in the Kerr era era, Wiseman has had the worst numbers per net rating in a two-man combo with Steph and the only players worse than him played with rookie Steph or did not play in the NBA the season after. From the Kerr era, no two-man combo involving Steph has ever had a worse ORTG than Steph/Wiseman.  What does Wiseman do well, exactly? Finish? Yeah, but he's also 7'1 and in the 99th percentile of human athleticism. He should at the bare minimum, finish well. At this point his jumper is mostly an idea. He's shooting 33% on jumpers this year and only 63% from the free throw line. On the year, Wiseman is shooting 30% from shots in the paint that are not in the restricted area, 29.7% on hook shots, and is shooting 34% from the mid-range. Add that all up and there's a body of evidence that suggests Wiseman doesn't have a natural shooter's touch. Beyond that, his shot selection is really bad. It's still a bit of a mystery as to whether the coaching staff wants Wiseman to post up or he's seeking out those shots himself, but he's a bad post player at this point. Victor Oladipo and Jimmy Butler punk'd him multiple times last night and he spins himself into trouble and fades on an alarming number of shots.  Wiseman has looked way more comfortable in PNR situations this year and I absolutely believe that he should be running more of those, but his PPP there isn't stellar either. Looney, Paschall, Dray, JTA, and Steph all have a higher PPP than Wiseman does as the roll man, albeit on lower volume (the only one who comes close to matching the frequency of PNR roll man is Paschall)."
That's Tank commander Victor Oladipo
Victor Oladipo for my Rockets this year
"lol 🙏, as a Rockets fan I can say at least for your sake it wasn’t for Victor Oladipo."
"Yell that to victor oladipo. Like seriously, teams sign guys to 10 day contracts to see if they have anything in the tank, it's not like he got signed to a 4 year 80 million dollar deal lol"
"The difference between westbrook and jokic is that westbrooks best teamate that season was Victor Oladipo.  Jokic has a great balanced team around him that could possibly contend for 8th spot without him, westbrooks team on the other hand, would be lucky to not finish last."
"The top 5 nba draft picks from from 2012-2016 (to weed out players who are still on rookie deals)  * 2012:  AD at 1, Brad Beal at 3, to be fair then Dame at 6. AD and Dame were All Stars quickly, but Beal didn't make an All-Star team until 2018 * 2013: Victor Oladipo made one all star game. A famously pretty bad draft,, though * 2014: Joel Embiid is a slam dunk. Meanwhile people are still waiting to see if Aaron Gordon figures it out, and it's taken Andrew Wiggins 6 years to (maybe) become a good player.  * 2015: KAT, DLo, Zinger all took a while and there are still big questions surrounding all of them.  * 2016: Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, and Jaylen Brown all look to be good players but have also all had weird paths to get where they are now.    My point in all of that even top 5 picks are rarely immediately good. It usually takes a couple of seasons to really know what you have, especially when they're entering the league at 18 years old."
"Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo, Bam Adebayo.  No bias btw"
A team with 5 MVP level players should not be getting taken to 7 by Victor Oladipo and rookie Jayson Tatum lol
Miami Heat are 1-0 with Victor Oladipo
John Wall *and* Victor Oladipo.
Also guess Victor Oladipo didn’t have a chance to beat the Cavs in 2018 even though up 3-2.
"Victor Oladipo: Coach, I know Harden has just left, but I was hoping to take over his role as I played well in preseason  /U/objectivedeal: kick rocks, shitbird."
20 games of victor oladipo says no
He was drafted with the Magic's pick so technically it wasn't his pick (not sure if the Magic made the selection or he got the pick first then drafted with it)  Sidenote the Magic gave up the Sabonis draft pick and Victor Oladipo for Serge Ibaka and then traded him to Toronto for T Ross and a pick (I'm not going to type that name) that did not turn out yikes.
i could tell you that victor oladipo is one of the most athletic players in the league without seeing him jump and dunk once. there’s more to athleticism than “can dunk the ball”
"IMO, even worse than this is they could’ve just held on to Caris Levert who was having a great season before being traded and is a better player than Victor Oladipo who they just shipped off for peanuts."
Maybe try getting a DPOY candidate that’s 24 years old instead of Victor Oladipo? That’s probably a good start.
"This is much ado about nothing.  The buyout market favors GOOD contending teams.  It has no extra incentive for players to go to big markets than they normally would as free agents.  The small-market execs might as well be complaining about how their smaller city doesn't offer the same kind of nightlife and business opportunities as LA, NY, or Chicago.  This is the typical small market whining spun to make it seem like a new argument when its not.    Beck's writeup takes liberties with what is considered a big market because it doesn't help his argument.  He begins that paragraph with ""Other contenders had to work a little harder to strengthen their rosters last week."" as if switching the focus to ""other contenders"" isn't supposed to support the main point that small markets are being hurt.  The word ""small"" appears 10 times in his article, and is ALWAYS referencing the size of the market.  The word ""contender/contending"" appears 6 times, with 5 of those times directly used as a synonym for ""big market"" teams instead of simply a stand-in for ""good"" teams.  Its a bait-and-switch, he's throwing in ""contender/contending"" to make it seem like the complaints are about contending teams as well when its in fact all about big markets.    And of the teams he listed like the Nuggets, Clippers, Bucks, Sixers, and Heat, 2 of them laughably not big markets, but they're in his list because it helps to prove his point AFTER he's got the reader already hooked on his point of view that big = contender.  Denver is a middling sized city (13th in city size, 16th in metro size) and the Bucks are 20th and 24th in city/metro.  They should not be lumped together with the other teams.  In fact, a more fair article would have them on *opposing* sides.  The paragraph should instead read:  &gt; ""Though other contenders had to work a little harder to strengthen their rosters last week, not all were big markets.  The Clippers had to give up Lou Williams, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year, to get Rajon Rondo.  The Sixers traded players and picks to get George Hill. The Heat traded players and draft considerations to get Victor Oladipo.  *However*, the Nuggets traded players and draft picks to get Aaron Gordon and the Bucks traded players and picks to get P.J. Tucker.""  This rewrite of his paragraph gives at least a cursory opposition view that not all big markets are benefiting, its the good teams, and that's by design and nobody's fault and not a problem.  But writing an article saying ""Nothing is wrong, everything is just fine"" doesn't draw clicks.  You know what would draw clicks though but probably get Beck blacklisted by half the NBA teams?  Writing about the real problem, which is that cheap/bad owners drive players away and destroy competitiveness.  If you want to talk about big vs. small market teams, why not bring up the fact that the Knicks haven't exactly been a robust destination in the buyout market cause they've sucked for 20 years?  How about part of this competitive balance being destroyed by a big market team in Houston?  Frittata got rid of anyone who mattered in Houston and drove away his best player because he's cheap and wouldn't pay guys.  Want more?  Paul George said himself that he recruited AD to Indiana but the Pacers owner didn't want to pay him, citing they're a small market.  You know what's not small about Herb Simon?  His $2.6 billion net worth.  You know who's considered a pauper by NBA owner standards?  Jeanie Buss, owner of the Lakers and valued at a mere $500 million.  In fact, the trust that her father set up splits the ownership between all 6 kids, so even though she's technically the owner, she owns only 1/6th of the Lakers not counting the AEG partial ownership, which is 27%.  So technically, she only owns 11% of the 66% percent the Buss siblings own.  Yet she'll spend money like its going out of style to make sure the Lakers are relevant.    If there is a problem with buyouts, then it is NOT a fight between big and small markets.  Its a fight between good and bad teams AS IT SHOULD BE, and a fight between owners willing to spend and owners not willing to spend AS IT SHOULD BE.  The unnamed small-market execs quoted in the article would do a lot better to bring their complaints up to their owners and tell them to open their wallets if they want talent.  Or these GMs should tell their owners to fire them and hire better GMs.  They won't do that though, and therein lies the real reason why this article was written."

"Everyone’s saying stuff like “oh bulls won the trade deadline! The clippers won the trade deadline”, nah Aaron Gordon and Victor Oladipo won the trade deadline."
"""Because playmaking ability increases your ability in the half court.""  Yeah sure, but again I clearly said ""AS A SCORER"" - I don't see why you continue to emphasize playmaking lol. Giannis is a better playmaker though - if that makes you happy?  ""Giannis and Zion are similar level  ball handlers. Both have similar usage rates and similar turnovers.""  You can't gauge a player's ball handling ability on usage rate &amp; turnover % lol come on. These are two of my three favorite players in the league - I watch both of them a lot, and Zion is definitely a superior ball handler. If you watch them both, Zion's less prone to out of control drives than Giannis, and he also operates better in tight spaces than Giannis - which is to be expected given that he's not a 7 footer like Giannis, and has been playing basketball since a far younger age.  ""Now this part is just objectively  wrong. Volume definitely matters in assessing the quality of a shooter.""  Yes, and Giannis has shot fucking TERRIBLY on significant volume. Shooting volume is a positive when when you're a good shooter - not when you're literally one of the worst shooters in the league.  ""Zion in his entire career has made 14 threes, no he isn’t a “better shooter.”""  Who are you quoting lol? I didn't say Zion's a better shooter - I just said it's hilarious to describe Giannis as the better shooter when he's hitting 30% despite largely taking open shots. Saying Giannis isn't the better shooter is not the same as saying Zion is the better shooter - they're about even right now, although clearly Zion doesn't have the janky mechanical issues that Giannis has.  Anyway, you can't compare their 3pt shooting when Zion barely takes them, I agree - but that's a N/A at best for Giannis. Free throw shooting does count as shooting though, and Zion is simply better than Giannis on that front.  ""Do you think Ben Simmons is the same level shooter as Victor Oladipo? They’re both shooting 33% from three for the season so surely  they must be.""  That's a terrible example because obviously Oladipo takes tougher 3s given that every defender sags off Simmons like crazy. That works AGAINST your argument for Giannis given that he also gets the Simmons treatment, which makes his 30% look even worse."
"&gt;First off, the original comment you quoted clearly said ""as a scorer"" so idk why you're mentioning playmaking.  Because playmaking ability increases your ability in the half court. A scorer with no court vision is easier to scheme around, look at Dame vs the Pelicans. His lack of playmaking just got him caught in traps and double teams.  &gt;Secondly, Zion is better at getting to the rim at will in a half court setup - which is predicated on his ball handling, agility, explosiveness, and low center of gravity - he has an advantage over Giannis in each of these aspects.  Giannis and Zion are similar level ball handlers. Both have similar usage rates and similar turnovers. Yes, Zion is more explosive and athletic but that’s not very valuable against a set defense like a wall. He’ll have to create openings with his playmaking but that isn’t very easy against elite defenses (2019 Raptors, 2020 Heat)  &gt;Lastly, I love Giannis but saying he's a ""better shooter"" is hilarious. Taking more 3s =/= better shooter. He generally takes open 3s that the defense is giving to him on a plate and he's hitting 30% of them. Not to mention that Zion's a better FT shooter.  Now this part is just objectively wrong. Volume definitely matters in assessing the quality of a shooter. Zion in his entire career has made 14 threes, no he isn’t a “better shooter.” Do you think Ben Simmons is the same level shooter as Victor Oladipo? They’re both shooting 33% from three for the season so surely they must be. Zions FT% is barely higher and even then, just because Zion is a better FT shooter that doesn’t make him a better overall shooter"
"Yeah, Rookie Sabonis, Steven Adams, and Victor Oladipo were total studs then dude. This sub lmfao"
"&gt; except turns out Sabonis, and to a lesser degree Adams, and Oladipo are not trash-tier players   Sabonis literally did nothing at okc, Adams is great at doing shit off ball but offensively he's nothing but a screen and a pair of hands next to the rim and victor was not the same player he was in Indiana."
Through no competition each time. The most difficult faced in both of those runs was the VICTOR OLADIPO PACERS. Calm down.

"&gt;According to sources, at the beginning of free agency Indiana was the preferred destination for the former All-Star. As the two front offices went about discussing the logistics of executing such a move, it is rumored to be the case that C’s General Manager, Danny Ainge, got “greedy”, for he wanted more than just the reported initial offer of Myles Turner &amp; Doug McDermott and, instead, wanted Victor Oladipo to be apart of the trade.  It was Ainge who was the idiot. He asked for Oladipo. Your comment makes it seem like he didnt want oladipo. I'm not going to ho through the timeline because I have better work to do.

"Victor ""Despite His Inefficiency"" Oladipo"
"1. Yes, for Barnes   2. Allen Robinson tweeted Drummond to the Nets, so I'll go with that   3. Tough question. Honestly don't know. Maybe Denver?  4. 6  5. 9  6. Victor Oladipo"
"Ah yes, the pre-stardom Victor Oladipo who scored 10.8 PPG on 42.4% TS in the playoffs and led the Thunder to a whopping -72.8 net rating (not an exaggeration) without Westbrook sure was a worthy second option."
"Yeah I mean you’re not wrong, and solid player the Warriors can get is a nice addition. I never thought about it, but he could fit the Igoudala role pretty well, IF he’s the same Victor Oladipo.   That’s just the part I’m unsure of, because Oladipo from 2-3 years ago I’d have no problem giving him any contract he wanted, especially if I’m over the cap anyways, I just don’t know if he’s that player anymore, and if he’s not, that albatross contract could be the difference between next year’s Warriors being the 1/2 seed or the 6/7 seed."
Now they’re saying they want a generational talent for victor oladipo

"For all that don't want to click on the article and direct traffic to B/R    &gt;Miami Heat shooting guard Victor Oladipo may reportedly miss the entire 2021-22 NBA season after Thursday's surgery on his right quadriceps tendon. ""They haven't announced it, but there's a good chance Oladipo's gonna miss all of next season,"" ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported on Friday's edition of the Hoop Collective podcast. Oladipo, who was acquired by the Heat in a March trade with the Houston Rockets, will be an unrestricted free agent this offseason with the conclusion of his four-year, $85 million contract"
'Good Chance' Victor Oladipo retired after that. Shame. Such a fun player for a hot minute.
Top of that list would be Zach Lavine however I could see it being Sabonis as well. His lady likes warmer weather and frankly I'm a little jaded after Paul George and Victor Oladipo

Who will get paid more this summer:  Victor Oladipo or Duncan Robinson?
Victor Oladipos name is neither victor nor oladipo
"Says you. OKC until this season was consistently a playoff team and overachieved expectations from the beginning. And has a relationship with their city that not many teams have. Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Derek Fisher, Victor Oladipo are just some of the names that have complimented the atmosphere with the team and how professional Presti is with them."
I'm assuming he means Victor Oladipo.
Bet he ain’t ready for the “healthy Victor Oladipo” conversation either lol
"Weve also had integral guys out for a while. Butler was out for a while because of covid. He, herro, and dragic have all missed ~20 games each this season. Avery Bradley barely played for us before we traded him because of covid and injury. Victor oladipo has barely played for us since the trade.  But yes, I do agree with your last sentence."
"He’s not bad.  He’s average.  He’s one of many coaches who can get a team to the playoffs but what he does when he gets there adjustment wise leaves a lot to be desired.  2018 was his best coaching job but he still bungled Indys minutes without Oladipo.  For example he took Victor out in a game when he had three fouls in the first half only for Victor to not get another foul the rest of the game and Indiana got murdered in the minutes without Victor that game and series as a whole.  Offensively he’s actually underrated because his Portland teams were slow paced but he’s really good at getting the ball in his best players hands and putting them in a position to succeed but outside of that he’s not the most creative.  Overall you can find a Nate McMillan around the league relatively without much difficulty.  He’s like a Steve Clifford or a Mike Malone level of coach.  They get the same out of there teams with similar level talent is available.  See Malone in Sacramento, Cliff in Orlando and Charlotte and Nate pretty much anywhere he’s been."
"LeBron and Davis probably won’t play. Durant won’t play either if Brooklyn goes on a deep playoff run.   Bam would be great, USA needs all the quality big men they can get.  LOL at Blake Griffin and Victor Oladipo “battling”"
"I got chu fam  Nate Bjorkgren, Indiana Pacers (30-34, 9th Seed in Eastern Confernce)  When the Pacers fired McMillan just weeks after giving him a one-year extension in late August, there were two traits that had clearly led to his exit: His hard-nosed style had caused consternation among players, and his unwillingness to embrace analytics was seen as a problem that simply had to be fixed. Bjorkgren, who had worked under Toronto’s Nick Nurse and made several G League stops along the way, was supposed to represent a change of direction on these two fronts — a new-age coach to take over a talented roster.  While he is indeed far more invested when it comes to coaching in accordance with modern-day NBA thinking, Bjorkgren’s abrasive style has come as a surprise — in interactions with players and his own coaching staff members — and led to the kind of frustration that has caused significant concern. It hasn’t been reserved merely for the players, either, as several sources cited instances where Bjorkgren’s personality and tendency to be controlling with assistant coaches and other staff members caused unnecessary tension.  Players throughout the roster have voiced their dissatisfaction with Bjorkgren and their general unhappiness amid a down season, including key star players in Domantas Sabonis and Malcolm Brogdon, sources said. Those sources say Bjorkgren has implemented an analytics style of coaching that players privately do not find suitable for the roster, and that there have been issues among the coaching staff at times. Bjorkgren has worked to address matters internally, and one source described him as “over-communicative” to make sure he is sharing and receiving messages from the roster. One coaching source predicted that this would have a similar ending to what took place in Charlotte in 2013, when former St. John’s assistant Mike Dunlap was fired after just one season amid widespread player frustration.  Indiana’s front office, led by president Kevin Pritchard and general manager Chad Buchanan, has built a players-first culture. After a loss in early April, Pritchard had an emotional message to players: Sources say the longtime executive tried to assure the players that the season would improve and their fortunes would turn.  As always, the contracts of all the involved parties is an important part of the context. Bjorkgren and Sabonis, in particular, both have multiple seasons left on their deals and, for better or worse, are connected when it comes to their successes and failures. Perhaps all of the principal decision-makers need a sit-down to iron out issues.  Across the roster, players are having career seasons under Bjorkgren — including Sabonis and Brogdon. The offense has been run through Sabonis throughout the campaign, and he has responded with an excellent season: 20.2 points, 11.9 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game. The Pacers, like most of the league, have dealt with injuries to key players throughout the season — currently Myles Turner being sidelined with a partially torn plantar plate in his right foot. They had to adapt to a blockbuster trade that sent Victor Oladipo out and brought in Caris LeVert. Oladipo had averaged 20 points per game in his nine games to start the season in Indiana, and while LeVert has posted 20 points per game himself since returning from his two-month absence after a procedure to cure kidney cancer.  In many ways, Pacers officials understood growing pains would come with the first-year head coach. Management had a level of comfort with Bjorkgren prior to his hire partly because of their previous history which dates back decades. What this all means going forward remains to be seen. Pacers owner Herb Simon has historically been reluctant to make coaching changes this early in the process, as every coach since he bought the team in 1983 has been given at least two seasons (Dick Versace had parts of three campaigns from 1989 to 1990, but just one complete season). More recently, former Pacers coaches like McMillan, Frank Vogel, Jim O’Brien and Rick Carlisle all had at least four seasons at the helm. Still, the level of early frustration here in the Bjorkgren era means this situation is definitely worth monitoring."
&gt; And he was the replacement for Victor Oladipo iirc  Exactly my point.  Also Jimmy Butler should have been the first injury replacement that season.
He should. Caris LeVert went down with an injury and D'lo picked up the slack to get them to the playoffs.   Nobody expected that team to even make it to the playoffs. And he was the replacement for Victor Oladipo iirc
Their biggest competition was Victor Oladipo and two 20 year olds
The fact that you think Victor Oladipo was a top 30 player in the league when he played with Russ is proof enough to me that I don't need to waste and prove you wrong lol.
"&gt;Victor Oladipo (top 30 player)  Not when he played with Westbrook he wasn’t. They lost to the 3 seeded rockets, led by Harden, why would he be expected to win that series.   &gt;Paul George (top 10 player)  They lost in the first round in 2017-18 cause of PG tbh, idk how you can blame Westbrook when he puts up 45 and 46 in games 5 and 6.   And in 2018-19 they lost to the 3 seeded Trailblazers as the 6 seed. Dame was playing out of his mind that series, especially in game 5.   &gt;James Harden (top 5 player)  Injuries plagued that offseason, and they lost to the eventual champions, the Lakers, who have two top 6 players in the league, and the Rockets who had no real big men in their lineup.   &gt;Bradley Beal (top 10 player)  That team is god awful outside of Beal and Westbrook.   We need to stop with all this Westbrook hate and just appreciate him while he’s still in the league. Just because a player doesn’t get it done in the playoffs doesn’t mean he’s not capable of winning.   Take CP3 for example, one of the best winners in the NBA, look at what he’s done for Houston, OKC and now the Suns, and what just cause he doesn’t have a ring that his ability to elevate teams isn’t incredible?    There are 4 (3ish) guys in the league right now who are proven to be capable of delivering a ring, Lebron, Kawhi, Steph, and KD. That doesn’t mean than the other superstars and hall of famers in the current NBA are incapable of winning."
Kelly Olynyk is going to get the contract that Victor Oladipo was hoping for.
"Butler and Adebayo are still playing like stars.  Pretty much everyone else has fallen off for various reasons, in large part due to injury and illness and lack of continuity.    Duncan Robinson in particular has struggled even as he's played the most minutes on the team, perhaps because almost everyone around him has missed time.  Even his free throw shooting percentage is down from last year.    Just as Robinson was playing better he left the Bulls game last night due to illness.  That leaves the Heat with little backcourt depth, with Victor Oladipo, Kendrick Nunn, and Tyler Herro all out.  They also miss Jae Crowder, who was an underrated veteran presence especially in the playoffs.  Crowder has been a valuable player for the Suns this season.  If everyone gets healthy they are still a threat in the East, but time is getting short, and they are going to have a rough road in the playoffs.    Last year they had the benefit of months off before the bubble.  That's not happening this year."
"It can't be CJ, he's a very good 3pt shooter with low turnovers and low steals.  I vote for Victor Oladipo. Their stat lines per 36 minutes are very similar. Ellis was a worse 3pt shooter, but Oladipo's career 3pt% is still considerably below league average."
A different way to ask this question: Which 23-27 year old player is an elite offseason away from being a star?   Victor Oladipo had a similar transformation.
"The Nate criticism never made any sense. He takes his teams as far as the talent allows in the playoffs and has a good regular season track record. What was he supposed to do, lead a Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis led team to the finals?"
McMillan didn't have two of his five starters in the play-offs last year all while having to deal with the corpse of Victor Oladipo in the line-up who only came to play after his pay-cheque was endangered.  That didn't count as an excuse though...
Victor Oladipo too
"My ass, he barely beat Victor oladipo and 19 year old tatum himself"
"I think a lot of it depends on the play of Tyler Herro, Victor Oladipo and to an extent, Duncan Robinson.   We know Jimmy is going to get it done on both ends, we know bam is going to get it done on both ends (guarding one of the 3 superstars every possession), and we know Dragic can boost the offense.   But Herro, his offense is needed to help match the Nets offense. He can’t be streaky, he needs to be consistent. Same for VO. I’m sure his defense will be fine, but he needs to get buckets.   Another X factor could be a guy like Kendrick Nunn, but the Heat seem to lean towards Dragic and Herro when it matters.    So, with that being said; if Herro and VO play well; Heat in 7   If not; Nets in 6"
"If you’re blowing your team up and giving up a top 10 player along with Russell Westbrook, why in the fuck are you looking for fit?   You obviously look for the most talented return. You know what’s not a good return? Victor Oladipo, and the other garbage they got.    I can’t believe I even have to have this conversation. You’re gonna get draft picks down the line so you can hopefully get a player as good as Ben Simmons? He’s a top 10 player under 25 and is likely going to win DPOY this year. Literally his only knock is that he can’t shoot. It’s not about competing in the next 4 years, it’s about building a foundation. Actively tanking does not work with the new lottery rules. Don’t you think OKC could trade SGA for more draft capital if they could? The reality is that Ben Simmons is a known quantity who is the 2nd best player on a #1 seeded team."
"I don’t think so, no. They lost KD and replaced him with Victor Oladipo in 2016-17, and then PG after that. Both good players, but not even close to KD."
"&gt;Why?   MINNEAPOLIS -- — Karl-Anthony Towns scored 24 points, including eight in the fourth quarter before fouling out, to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 119-111 win against the Miami Heat on Friday night.  Ricky Rubio added 17 points and Naz Reid scored 16 off the bench as Minnesota had seven players score in double-figures to overcome 21 turnovers. Towns keyed a 22-6 run midway through the fourth as the Timberwolves pulled away.  Towns missed the past two games due to personal reasons on the one-year anniversary of his mother’s death. Minnesota lost both games by at least 25 points to Brooklyn and Milwaukee. Against another Eastern Conference playoff contender, the Timberwolves finished strong to win for just the second time in six games, a stretch against all East teams.  “This win meant a lot to me, just being able to do what I love and be able to be on the court with these guys,” Towns said.  Jimmy Butler had 30 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, but Miami lost its third straight game, all coming on the road. Trevor Ariza scored a season-high 21 points for the Heat, who started the night seventh in the East and a half-game ahead of Charlotte.  “We don’t deserve to win,” Butler said. “Whenever we take these teams lightly, we don’t do what we’re supposed to do on the defensive end, we just look bad as a whole, as a group, as a unit. It’s not good basketball.”  Miami appeared ready to put away the Wolves, the West’s worst team at the start of the day. The Heat finished the third quarter on a 15-5 and led by five points with Goran Dragic hitting a buzzer-beating 3-pointer.  Towns didn’t let Minnesota fade away. He finished the pivotal fourth-quarter run with a deep 3 and walked back up the court holding out three fingers to the hometown crowd.  “Tough couple games this week for us, but we responded tonight,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “Total team effort; what I love about it is it was probably our best team effort of the season.”  TIP-INS  Heat: G Victor Oladipo missed his fourth straight game with right knee soreness. ... Butler, the former Timberwolves star who forced his way out with a trade, was booed loudly the first time he touched the ball by the limited fans in attendance. ... Butler recorded multiple steals for the ninth straight game, setting a franchise record and extending the longest streak of his career. Sherman Douglas had eight consecutive such games in 1990.  Timberwolves: G Jaylen Nowell missed the game with a right tibia contusion. ... Towns extended his streak of games with a 3 to 70 games, the longest stretch by a player in franchise history. ... Edwards had a steal for the 25th straight game, the longest active streak in the NBA, and longest by a rookie in team history. The NBA record for a rookie is 31 straight games by Chris Paul in 2005-06.  KEY STAT  Heat coach Erik Spoelstra highlighted an important factor in the win: second-chance points. Minnesota had 10 offensive rebounds leading to 23 second-chance points. Miami only had five second-chance points.  “That’s tough to overcome,” Spoelstra said. “That’s a problem right now, us being able to finish our defense. At least the last three games, that has not been good enough.”  JOINT FUNDRAISER  The Timberwolves and Heat agreed to auction their pregame “With Liberty and Justice FOR ALL” warmup shirts to raise money for The Daunte Wright Memorial Fund. Wright was the Black man fatally shot by a police officer on April 11 in a nearby suburb.  The Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks – the previous two teams to play in Minnesota – along with the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx joined the cause. Each shirt will be autographed by players. The auction ran concurrently on the Timberwolves’ website during Friday’s game.  UP NEXT  Heat: Host the Nets on Sunday.  Timberwolves: Travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Sunday.  ------"
"Well hey, at least you still got Oladipo. But maaaan do I feel bad for Rocket fans. They not only gave up their pick for this horrible year to OKC for Westbrook, a guy who they gave up on after one season basically making their suffering so far for nothing, but they also gave up their 2024 and 2026 picks plus a pick swap in 2025. Those would have hurt a lot later if they didn't trade James freaking Harden for a bunch of late first round picks, Caris LaVert and Jared Allen, who are actually a pretty good gets to build around. Not an amazing deal but they played the hand they were dealt well enough. Only for the front office to trade their center for the future for another late pick and bags of chips. Than, just to really show how incompetent they are without Morrey, they trade LeVert for Victor who they flip for a 29 and 30 year old bench players plus pick swap in 2022. So they basically got a bunch of late first round picks for James Harden. Just typing this all out makes me cringe lol."
"It would have been a bunch ""But I don't want Victor Oladipo""  whining."

"Last decade:  **2020:** James Wiseman (TBC)  **2019:** Ja Morant (potential All Star)  **2018:** Marvin Bagley (bust)  **2017:** Lonzo Ball (solid player but not #2 worthy)  **2016:** Brandon Ingram (All Star)  **2015:** D'Angelo Russell (has been an All Star, injuries have hindered)  **2014:** Jabari Parker (bust)  **2013:** Victor Oladipo (has been an All Star, injuries have hindered)  **2012:** Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (bust)  **2011:** Derrick Williams (bust)"
"Jimmy had covid, but Heat lost Meyers Leonard (good riddance) for season early on, and lost a bunch of games from Herro, Bam, and Dragic with injuries. Avery Bradley basically sat all year with injuries and then got traded for Victor Oladipo who is now also probably out for the season."
"&gt; Victor Oladipo, Ersan İlyasova and the draft rights to Domantas Sabonis  That netted them PG which in turn got them 7 draft picks and SGA. I'm no mathematician but sounds like a win for OKC."
"You say that like Nate is some schlub though. Nate should’ve been a second-tier COTY candidate below Thibs/Williams/Snyder, the Hawks have had one of the best records in the NBA under him and he’s already vanquished the “can’t win a playoff series” reputation - a reputation he developed, by the way, because he was apparently unable to take Victor Oladipo-led teams to series wins against LeBron-led teams."
Funny how people forget that the Heat were without Victor Oladipo. Likely one of the biggest losses out of all the playoff teams. Guarantee we would’ve taken Milwaukee to at least 4 if we had him

Indiana could be running with Tatum and Hayward rn but I guess their fans are ok with sabonis. It’s all nates fault that they can’t make it far"
"Yeah, he replaced an injured Victor Oladipo. Couldn’t even make the team in the crappy East without Dipo, who is a much better player when healthy, tearing his quadricep.  Give me all the downvotes. Russell is a slightly above-average player and one of the most inefficient volume scorers in the league.  Overrated."
Different roster constructions and different teams.   Also there’s a HUGE difference between beating teams with Victor Oladipo as it’s best player and beating teams with Giannis as their best player.
I guarantee you if KD was facing  Victor Oladipo or the rookie tatum led Celtics he would sweep through the east too. He's facing prime Giannis with a very nice supporting cast.
"Bron gets a fuck ton more scrutiny, but saying ""no chance"" it blows up? It's not like the question was ""will people give Victor Oladipo shit"""
"*Victor Oladipo enters the chat, hoping to hear good news*"
"He probably isn't a bad coach tactically speaking but you could tell early on they just weren't playing for him. He's like a shitter version of Thibs with no credentials to back it up.   That being said, the Pacers are just not very talented. They have a bunch of good 2nd and 3rd options but very little leadership all around. Their bench is one of the worst in the league too.   I also get the strong sense that Brogdon is quietly a diva. Turner is soft and Sabnois can get frustrated easily when things don't go his way early.    The team is a mess. But on the bright side, Victor Oladipo didn't take that insane contract they offered him."
"[Feigen] Victor Oladipo described the Rockets extension offer as a gesture made some time ago that they knew he would not accept, though he appreciated it. ""They wanted to show me they wanted me."""
I can already see it: Dame names Milwaukee as one of his preferred destinations... and they just stand pat and sign Victor Oladipo.
"And ends up drafting Anthony Bennett, Victor Oladipo, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len with the top 5 picks"
"I think it can be hard to judge the talent on a team when there's such a ball-dominant player on the team. Westbrook's MVP year got called out for ""get him some help"", but look at the guys on that team that flourished when they left and got more touches: Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Jerami Grant all played 1,500+ minutes that OKC season.  Even folks like Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and Cameron Payne are playing key minutes this year for decent teams."
"Lue is definitely not a trash coach, he's a good coach that had the fortune of having elite talent. But he coached championship winning teams and that should never be taken away from him.    Nate McMillan had playoff failures but he's also coached up talent and was a very good regular season coach. The difference between regular season success and playoff success has so many variables that it's hard to pinpoint one. But as time goes on, I think the difference between a player like Trae Young, and players like Victor Oladipo, Sabonis, and Brogdon may become more evident. Trae Young is looking like a future fixture top 10 player."
"Well obviously they’d rather have kept Harden, but they didn’t get complete dogshit like Victor Oladipo, who just turned into Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley. It was an awful take, and I personally think it was slightly worse than the take OKC got."
"Basketball-wise, I’m not sure where the improvement is gonna come. He’s just not a good shooter, and his handles are so bad that he can’t really get anywhere.  Unless he makes some ridiculous offseason improvement ala Victor Oladipo, he’s still not gonna be effective in the playoffs."
"Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell.  Anthony Bennett (out of the league), Victor Oladipo (derailed by injuries), Giannis Antetokounmpo (2x MVP and a DPOY), Rudy Gobert (DPOY).  Stephen Curry (still playing at an elite level) and Blake Griffin (now a role player/situational starter). And Curry's older as well."
Or Victor Oladipo
Victor Oladipo has left the chat.
The HEAT were missing  ~~Victor Oladipo~~ **Kelly Olynyk**
he had victor oladipo! how do you not beat peak lebron james when you have victor oladipo?! trash!
Kyle Kuzma  Victor Oladipo
as opposed to when it almost happened at the hands of victor fucking oladipo
"Lebron never faced anyone as good as the Suns (with Ayton in this form) in the 2018 East leading up to the finals.  Lebron had the absolute perfect year for his optics because the East was at its lowest point of the decade that year.  His biggest opponent the two previous years was PG who had left before the 2018 season, Kawhi wasn’t in the East yet, and Giannis/Embiid were still 1 year away from being the tough opponents we know now.  Lebron was pulling some GOAT tier shit that run, not saying he wasn’t, but it was the perfect storm of both elite play from him and having very easy opposition. His toughest matchup was Victor Oladipo lol"
"The funny thing is that Nate McMillan's also a regular season coach - back with his tenures with Portland and Indiana, a common criticism was that he could get his teams to the playoffs but underwhelm once they got there. Sure, injuries to key players like Brandon Roy and Victor Oladipo didn't help, but the sentiment was there.  So in this series we're seeing McMillan getting out regular season'd by Thibs."
I mean they took a package centered around victor oladipo and some picks
Victor Oladipo for me I bought low on him when he went to OKC and then I sold right after he made all nba.
"Duncan Robinson is 27, and injured Victor oladipo is 29. The rest of their ""young"" players are role players aside from bam."
"Not sure why you are saying “lmao” considering my point is directly correlated with my original comment nephew. If you had truly watched a game of Oladipo with the pacers, which I now understand that you haven’t (because you refused to answer), you would understand that even if injured, his potential is heavens above a Kelly Olynk, and that he fits way better with Miami’s timeline than KO ever could. And I love me some KO. My dude, I’ve been watching the heat for the last 8 years. Please don’t make strong claims if you don’t necessarily know what you’re talking about, which you have proved here.   If you decide to respond, please do so in good faith. What do I mean by that? I mean by answering my original question:  Before you try to rebut my response, please be honest (and even if you lie, you will at least know  within yourself that you were arguing in bad faith) and tell me if you have ever watched a full game of Victor Oladipo with the Pacers?"
Why would a team rebuilding want victor oladipo
"4% difference from a big man to a guard is abysmal. neither number is good at all. the difference is that olynyk is trying to be a tank god in houston so he can get a fat contract while oladipo clearly did not care, he just wanted to go to miami. Dipo shot poorly in his 4 games with the heat but if I recall correctly we won all or 3 of them. Small sample size but he wasn’t being asked to do much on offense, just be an occasional guy who could get to the basket / run a pnr with a bench big / make a catch and shoot 3. If victor oladipo is your third option on offense I would say you’re in good shape."
Fluke Heat will make a big mistake bringing back Victor Oladipo - does Riley have the guts to cut his losses?
Bucks lost an Eric Bledsoe and gained a Jrue Holiday.   Heat lost Jae Crowder and traded Kelly Olynyk for a Victor Oladipo with paper legs.
"Anytime you can turn Kelly Olynyk into Victor Oladipo, you do it. It's unfortunate he got injured, but that's a good trade"
"But the Cavs drafting Victor Oladipo would have made less of an impact to their team than if the Pistons drafted Melo. Objectively, you're right. But if you add the context, Darko was worse"
"Context is key here. The 3 players picked after Bennett were Victor Oladipo, Otto Porter, and Cody Zeller. The 3 guys after Darko were Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, and Dwayne Wade."
"Pretty sure Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Victor Oladipo, Derozan, Lowry, and Derrick Rose were the best players in the East the Cavs faced in their 4 finals runs.  &gt;The Jordan Bulls beat Magic, Isiah Thomas, Barkley, Shaq, Stockton/Malone in the playoffs.  Magic, Barkley, Stockton/Malone all played in the West Jordan didn't face them in the East."

Nah just hold the L. The man was traded for an expiring Victor Oladipo and a bag of funions you could have had him
It’s ok buddy I’d be upset if I traded for Victor Oladipo too
So you’re telling me a guy like Victor Oladipo when he played for the Pacers was “up there”? what ever OP meant as up there.
Victor oladipo having a ts% of 57.7% in 2017-2018 when he's never been over 53.4% in his career
"but he's a bad coach, he couldn't take a team with the corpse of victor oladipo out of the first round!"
"They're also going into the playoffs significantly healthier than the last two Pacers squads McMillan coached. Like it blows my mind that people just ignore the Pacers lost their best player in Sabonis when they entered the bubble (on top of it being the bubble, which people don't treat as the weird environment that it was). The season before that, they were 25-11 with Victor Oladipo and then 23-23 the rest of the season. We never treat those seasons as kind of shocks that McMillan was averaging 48 wins a season with those Pacers roster (and while managing consistent injuries). The Hawks were dead in the water (somewhat understandably) when McMillan took over and now they're here, and they're finally getting healthy with Hunter coming back (and depending on how you feel about Reddish)."
paul george - victor oladipo
Sadly probably Victor Oladipo
Trade for Victor Oladipo
Brittle ass victor oladipo
Yeah... But Russ had a really good defensive squad backing him up. And Victor Oladipo helping him out as the second best scorer at almost 16ppg.
"Damn you’re right and, he should sign victor oladipo"
You’re thinking of victor oladipo
Victor oladipo needs victor oladipo healthy real bad.
You guys need victor oladipo healthy real bad.
"Christian Wood, Eric Gordon, Victor Oladipo (when we had him), Kelly Olynyk, Kevin Porter Jr are all well known good players.   Sterling Brown shot 43% from 3 this year on high volume. Brooks is shooting 39%, KJ Martin is shooting 40%. Not even gonna name all the other players who have done well for us this year.  Why we acting like he was playing next to 15 Anthony Bennetts? Any other PG would have made the most of what they had instead of playing without a care in the world, especially when they want to prove themselves coming off an injury."
2nd best player in franchise history after Victor Oladipo
"Karl Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton (recently), Terry Rozier, Victor Oladipo."
You think I’m angry and you are bringing up Dario Saric and Victor Oladipo   If I’m “angry” you need to be hospitalized for insanity
He's got the [4th best recorded vertical](https://hoopshype.com/lists/best-leapers-nba-victor-oladipo/) in combine history and almost won the slam dunk contest in 2020.

Victor Oladipo
&gt;Flair: Lakers  &gt;It’s not about market size  Lmao I swear to fuckin god it’s always a Lakers fan that says dumb shit like this. The biggest free agent signing in the history of the Pacers is David West lmao and it’s daylight second. Paul George went and snaked his way out of town then Victor Oladipo did the same.  Other teams have the same history it’s not just a Pacers thing.
"In 2017, George was traded for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis, at a time when Dipo was seen as as disappointing and Sabonis as solid but nothing special. In 2018, Jimmy was traded for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a 2022 2nd round draft pick."
"PG - Harden SG - Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Durant C - DeAndre Jordan / Nicolas Claxton  They need a back up forward and back up guard and the 8 man rotation is set.  I can see two of the players below deciding to sign a cheap deal to get a ring with the Nets.  Guard - Victor Oladipo, Goran Dragic, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose, E’Twaun Moore  Forward - Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, Paul Millsap, Reggie Bullock, Markieff Morris"
Injuries have robbed us of Victor Oladipo after that incredible 7 game series vs the Cavs. Does he count?
G Monte Morris  G Victor Oladipo   F Giannis   F Bam   C Ayton
Monte Morris / Victor Oladipo / OG Anunoby / Giannis / Ayton would be filthy. Bam sixth man could do serious damage too.   Only position that's below average is PG
"Kyle Lowry would be the top FA in pacers franchise history.  Given that indys GM bungled the Hayward signing last year because he didn’t want to give up Victor Oladipo, I can 100% buy that he’d miss this opportunity as well.  I can also 100% buy that Indy fans are going to defend their GMs honor on reddit after he misses yet another opportunity to get them past the first round. They are already doing it preemptively"
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"

Still some other teams that could make it   02/03 - Jermaine O'Neal  O'Neal being a 6 time all-star and 3 time all-nba could get him in the conversation in the future but it would be a weak pick  17-18 - Victor Oladipo  Others will argue there are way too many unknowns with this one but for mine it's Oladipo who is the biggest risk to stopping this class from making it
"The Rockets trading James Harden for washed Victor Oladipo, who they ended trading for fucking Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk, is definitely up there. It’s unbelievable that Harden was part of two of the worst trades in NBA history less than ten years apart."
Victor Oladipo and the draft pick that became Domantas Sabonis for a Serge Ibaka that didn't want to play for the Magic and got traded 6 months later.
Book overated not as good as Victor Oladipo
"He also spent the summer working his ass off, training for it. That's another thing people never talk about. Like Victor Oladipo is who he is because, in his own words, he saw how Westbrook trains and spent his off-season working like him."
Victor Oladipo and Mario Hezonja
Victor oladipo  Hakeem Olajuwon   Bam adebayo  Ayton ( much more lose on this)   Igoudala  I don’t know what the fuck you are talking about
Victor oladipo  Hakeem Olajuwon   Bam adebayo  Ayton ( much more lose on this)   Igoudala
I feel like it depends a lot on who is drafted shortly after them (picks like 8+ later that no GM would have selected don't count). Victor Oladipo should have been the number 1 pick in his draft class but if he was in the 2018 draft class he would have arguably been a bust selected first overall.

No love for pre injury Victor Oladipo? Damn. Tough crowd.
Paul George FOR Victor Oladipo/Domantas Sabonis
Using the same (bad) advisor as Victor Oladipo? 😂
"Even the Cavs owner wanted Victor Oladipo, and most draft boards had Nerlens Noel as the #1 before he went down with injury.  Who the fuck thought drafting Bennett at #1 was a good idea"
"**2014 select team**  * Harrison Barnes, Golden State Warriors * Trey Burke, Utah Jazz * Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls * Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors * Tim Hardaway Jr., New York Knicks * Tobias Harris, Orlando Magic * Doug McDermott, Chicago Bulls * Victor Oladipo, Orlando Magic * Mason Plumlee, Brooklyn Nets * Miles Plumlee, Phoenix Suns * Marcus Smart, Boston Celtics * Dion Waiters, Cleveland Cavaliers * Cody Zeller, Charlotte Hornets  where?"
"Shaquille O’Neal. No one’s that big, strong, and quick anymore. He’s bad at free throws but it’s true that he does knock them down most of the time when it matters most.  Victor Oladipo as well. This dude has such a short neck that he’ll probably do well as a boxer."
Victor Oladipo
"I think he's much more athletic than all 3 of those guys too. He's grabbed a few crazy rebounds because of his hops (38 inch vertical). His foot speed is also impressive, I feel that he blows by guys pretty consistently. I actually see a little Victor Oladipo in him with the mixture of shot creation and defense with athleticism."
"&gt;Shaq was undeniably a better player.  I'm pretty sure you're judging every after 1992 instead of 92 itself when you say this. That's what the first pick in the draft is doing too. They definitely made the right pick but that's not what I'm talking about.   &gt;Was Trey Burkes the better college player than Victor Oladipo in 2013? Was Buddy Hield a better player in 2016 than Simmons or Ingram?  Haven't followed college basketball in a awhile but I would assume so, yes. If I was picking someone for a 2020 Olympic team I'd take Toppin and not James Wiseman."
Or you’re argument of “well he won college player of the year” is completely ignoring the fact that Shaq was undeniably a better player. Was Trey Burkes the better college player than Victor Oladipo in 2013? Was Buddy Hield a better player in 2016 than Simmons or Ingram?  The dream team was not a college accolades reward. It is meant for the best players. Shaq was a better player in 1992.
yeah Victor Oladipo and Brandon Jennings would have titles if Lebron didn't exist
Victor Oladipo
Brandon Ingram.  Joel Embiid.  Victor Oladipo.
"LeBron's most hyped up run where he carried a ""weak team"" (2018) was such a cakewalk (and Kevin Love was an all star that year btw).  Victor Oladipo and Bojan Bogdanovic took him to 7 in round 1. Got the mentally weak star-less Raptors in round 2. Then got taken to 7 by the baby Celtics with Kyrie and Hayward out and Tatum a rookie.  KD would have easily carried Cleveland to the finals that year too."
"Free agent Victor Oladipo has signed a maximum contract with the Guangdong Southern Tigers, league sources tell ESPN."
"Nope. The lottery and the NBA for that matter is a lot like life.  It’s not fair.   When we start creating rules to allow for equal outcome rather than equal opportunity, we are opening up a can of worms that we wouldn’t be able to come back from.   You want to complain about the system? How about complain about the front offices of the Kings and Magic that can’t build a winning team after many years of top 10 picks.   It’s not the Cavs/Raptors fault that the Kings drafted Marvin Bagley, Marquese Chriss, Willie Cauley-Stein, Nik Stauskas, Ben McLemore and Thomas Robinson with top 10 picks in the recent years.  It’s also not their fault that the Magic selected Mo Bamba, Mario Hezonja and a bunch of good but not great players for them like Jonathon Issac, Aaron Gordon and Victor Oladipo all in the top 10."
"So if all you need is one of your parents to be Nigerian...   I guess this means,  Victor Oladipo  Bam Adebayo   turned them down?  Nigeria's got one of those teams to watch, in that they got a lot of NBA talent so feasibly they match up well with the USA, the other team I reckon to watch being Canada (no Jamal Murray though.)  Men's Olympic BBall should actually be amazing this time."
"Probably #1 and no way he slips past #2 as he would be better than at least 17/20 (Ja and LMA are toss-ups imo) out of the last 20 years of #2 picks  2020 James Wiseman, Memphis - Golden State Warriors  **2019 Ja Morant, Murray State – Memphis Grizzlies**  2018 Marvin Bagley, Duke – Sacramento Kings  2017 Lonzo Ball, UCLA – Los Angeles Lakers  2016 Brandon Ingram, Duke – Los Angeles Lakers  2015 D’Angelo Russell, Ohio State – Los Angeles Lakers  2014 Jabari Parker, Duke – Milwaukee Bucks  2013 Victor Oladipo, Indiana – Orlando Magic  2012 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Kentucky – Charlotte Bobcats  2011 Derrick Williams, Arizona – Minnesota Timberwolves  2010 Evan Turner, Ohio State – Philadelphia 76ers  2009 Hasheem Thabeet, Connecticut – Memphis Grizzlies  2008 Michael Beasley, Kansas State – Miami HEAT  **2007 Kevin Durant, Texas – Seattle Supersonics**  **2006 LaMarcus Aldridge, Texas – Chicago Bulls (Draft rights traded to Portland Trail Blazers)**  2005 Marvin Williams, North Carolina – Atlanta Hawks  2004 Emeka Okafor, Connecticut – Charlotte Bobcats  2003 Darko Milicic, Serbia &amp; Montenegro – Detroit Pistons  2002 Jay Williams, Duke – Chicago Bulls  2001 Tyson Chandler, Dominguez HS (Calif.) – L.A. Clippers (Draft rights  traded to Chicago Bulls)"
"Against prime Victor Oladipo, the most mentally weak #1 seed in East history and a Celtics team w/o Kyrie led by rookie Tatum"
the Suns path is harder the the 2018 Cavs  path imo  Victor Oladipo was the best player the Cavs played against at the time
"That draft sucked though. There are like 2 all star caliber guys in that entire draft in Giannis and Rudy. The third best guy there was victor oladipo lmao.  The fultz pick was in a draft with Tatum, Fox, issac, Bam, Donovan.   That’s 2 future mvp quality guys and 3 guys who are probably all star caliber going forwards (assuming issac gets healthy 🤞)."
"The solution for Morey - sell high on Embiid by sending him to Miami in a 3-team deal and surround Simmons with more shooters to maximize Simmons desire to pass up open dunks for open three-pointers.   Here's the deal: We send Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Oladipo, and our 2025 FRP to Philly because mOrE ShOoTeRs! OKC unlocks protections on our 2023 FRP and we send them our 2028 FRP. We all know how Presti loves him those FRPs! OKC also sends Kemba Walker to Miami, we'll take that bad boy's contract on!   Philly can run a starting lineup of Simmons, Curry, Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, and Danny Green, with Maxey, Thybulle, and Victor Oladipo off the bench for some added defense. Just imagine how many assists Ben would get per game!"
"Sorry Rockets for clowning you for trading 1x MVP James Harden for ~~Caris Levert,~~ no wait ~~Victor Oladipo~~, Kelly Olynyk and some late first round picks."
"a) the players all year were begging for more modern offence. nate was saying no.   b) we didn't make the playoffs this year because of injuries. TJ Warren played 4 games. we were playing excellent modern offensive basketball basketball at the start of the year before we traded Victor Oladipo for Caris LeVert, who missed plenty of games because he literally had cancer. we'll be back in the playoffs next year."
His teams were constantly injured and not that good  His team almost beat 2018 Bron with fucking Victor Oladipo as his best player
"I remember seeing him in the dunk contest in 2015 and being like  ""This kid sucks.""  Cause he missed all of his first round dunks and the second round one was mediocre. And Zach Lavine was throwing up Vince level dunks between Mason Plumlee and Victor Oladipo."
"Who'd he play, victor oladipo, DeMar defrozen and the fake 1 seed raptors everyone knew was a joke, rookie Jayson Tatum without Kyrie and Hayward. KD played much harder competition than Lebron and it's not close"
2018 Lebron toughest competition  in the East was Victor Oladipo Pacers and a rookie Tatum led Celtics
"&gt; It’s kinda crazy a guy scoring 26 PPG in the regular season isn’t considered a superstar nowadays  You realize Jerami Grant of the Pistons averaged 22.3 ppg which was 23rd best in the league.  Victor Oladipo averaged 21.2 ppg on the Rockets  Nikola Vucevic averaged 23.4 ppg on the Magic, 21st best in the league  EVERY team has to have someone scoring 20 something because someone has to score or else every game would be a 20+ point spread."

Victor Oladipo was considered a late bloomer and made his leap in his year 25 season. Malcolm Brogdon will be 29 in December.
"2-4 years can change a lot about a player.  In 2 years Victor Oladipo went from a nobody to an All-NBA, All-Defensive player, and then in another 2 years was back to being an afterthought."
"History is written by the victors.  For example, Victor Oladipo"
Do you really have to remind me about how the Rockets got a few months of Victor Oladipo who didn't care and was injured for the 2nd greatest player in franchise history?
"Projection is literally what the draft is.  If day 1 quality was all that mattered, Brandon Roy would have gone 1st. Buddy Hield would have gone 1st. Victor Oladipo goes 1st (good decision in this case). Marcus Smart might have gone 1st. Obi Toppin possibly goes 1st."
Jason Terry   AI   Lonzo Ball   Chris Webber   Shaq   Dame   Victor Oladipo
And 1 player was drafted before Rockets Legend Victor Oladipo
"Stephon Marbury, players forgotten in this generation will probably be like Pascal Siakam, Victor Oladipo, Demarcus Cousins, and Kemba Walker just to list a few."

He sat out final two games with knee soreness. Oladipo was my second try.
Literally Victor Oladipo. Gave up huge offers from Indy and Houston to take the min in Miami.
Victor Oladipo.
"Starters:   Ben Simmons   Kyrie Irving   Brandon Ingram   Zion Williamson   Anthony Davis     Bench:   Ja Morant   Victor Oladipo   Karl Anthony-Towns     I'd consider swapping KAT and Zion in my starting lineup, let Ben start so Morant can avoid injury and be the spark off the bench. Dipo over John Wall for a bit of length and defense."
"Guys who made all star appearances that people will forget on sporcle quizzes: Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver, Chris Kaman, Victor Oladipo, Deangelo Russell, Kristaps Porzingis, Julius Randle, Goran Dragic, and Roy Hibbert."
Victor Oladipo and John Wall at the bottom for pull up % perfectly describes our season last year
"If the rockets had eliminated the warriors the cavs weren’t a issue at all lol. Lebron can’t do everything.

Its the exact opposite Reddit is against the Ultra Rich yet they care so much about players who have made 100+ Million dollars making even more money.   Victor Oladipo way closer to the owners than the Middle class.
"Victor Oladipo vs. Dennis Schröder, Money in the Bank 2022 for the Million Dollar Championship if Ted DiBiasi.  Wonder if someone would at least pay for that..."
"He has won exactly one playoff series that way, against a Pacers team without Victor Oladipo. The OKC team Russ and Harden beat was miles better."
"Victor Oladipo also made two all star games. But yeah, that's literally it."

This isnt even the worst one Victor Oladipo literally turned down 4 yrs $112 mil like 8-9 months ago.
"its funny how MJ in 13 playoffs has played against more 50+ win teams then Lebron. MJ would make the finals every year alone if his toughest competition  was Paul George, Rose, 5'9 Isaiah Thomas,  Victor Oladipo, rookie Jayson tatum"
"If you listen to those who've played and practiced with Russ, the man WORKS! Victor Olidipo https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2017/11/29/victor-oladipo-praises-russell-westbrook-during-career-year-i-learned-so-much-from-him/"
"no it really was   lebrons toughest competition was young victor oladipo, young paul george, the trash bros, and other trash ass teams  literally has faced less all nba players in the east than mj did in all his finals. that enough speaks volumes to his weak ass conference"
Victor Oladipo hasn’t played more than 36 games in a season since 2018. He’s currently injured too
Sounds like he's got a lot in common with Victor Oladipo
"Sorry I was busy with stuff.  Beal was obviously their prime target, but apparently he doesn't want out. If that's the case, they should probably engage Toronto on the Siakam front, or they maybe should've even kicked the tires on Derozan (who graded out by Bball Index's LEBRON metric as a better overall player than Wiggins last year).   Those are, of course, bigger signings, so if we look at smaller ones, what about Danny Green? Paul Millsap? Ben Mclemore? Victor Oladipo? Just guys who can come in and contribute more easily than others. Frankly I think they should've just traded Oubre earlier for something else, but that's a different story altogether.   The initial point of discussion I wanted to bring up was that I think the Warriors FO isn't doing right by Steph, and that they should really be cashing more chips in on winning now as opposed to threading the needle. At the very least, I personally think they should be erring more towards winning now. You guys might disagree, and of course who am I but a random guy who doesn't work in any NBA FO, and that's all fine. It's just my opinion."
"He's worse than he ever has been in his career. This is gonna be one of those random trivia bits in the future like ""who the fuck is Victor Oladipo and how did he make all-NBA one year"""

"Lebron had just come off a gruelling 7 game series 36 hours earlier where he barely squeaked by a team led by Victor Oladipo and Myles Turner and the Raptors could’ve/should’ve won that game by 20. That game should’ve never been close to begin with. Lebron was running on pure fumes.  And if you want to dissect games in that manner, all 4 of the Cavs wins in the Pacers series were by 4 points or less. They came extremely close to losing. Again, to a team led by Oladipo and Turner. A weaker team than the Raptors were supposed to be.  A sweep to a lower seed can and should never be rationalized away. It is an embarrassing and completely unacceptable outcome no matter the circumstance."
"Dipo wanted to play anywhere but Indiana, not necessarily Miami. He also expressed interest in playing for the [Knicks and Raptors](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2020/11/victor-oladipo-pacers-asked-to-play-for-other-teams-knicks). He doesn’t seem like a loyal guy imo."
"Oubre, Danny Green or Victor Oladipo. All are still open and are all guys the Bucks should be looking at imo."

"You’re right, he should turn down this second smaller bag and run it back on a 1-year prove it deal. Then he can secure the *real* bag that he’s been chasing all along.    As we know, this strategy worked flawlessly for Victor Oladipo, so Nerlens is a fool for signing this deal and selling himself short."

"An ACL tear is like a 5/10 on the injury-seriousness scale. Like there's still a small chance you're never the same, but more often than not you'll bounce back to a 100%.    An achilles injury is like a 9/10. It's nearly certain you'll never be the same. KDs story is a real life miracle.   The only thing I can think of thats worse than an achilles injury is a ruptured quad. That ended Charles Barkley's career and has turned Victor Oladipo from an All Star to a vet minimum level player."

"Plus/minus is not at all a consistent metric for defining one single player's impact when they're on the court.   Using that logic we can conclude that Bradley Beal, De'Aaron Fox, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Victor Oladipo, LaMelo Ball, Russell Westbrook, Buddy Hield and Zach LaVine are not NBA caliber talent, correct? After all, they all have a negative +/- on the season"
"Idk, he hasn't lived up to being #4 but this thing is a crap shoot. 2013 was Anthony Bennett/Victor Oladipo/Otto Porter/Cody Zeller. 2014 was Andrew Wiggins/Jabari Parker/Joel Embiid/Aaron Gordon. Alex Len and Dante Exum were the #5s those years. You obviously hope to get a franchise-altering guy in the top 10 (especially top 4), but really you're praying to avoid a bust. An above average role player historically isn't bad for a Top-10 pick."
"if your idea of big free agent is Spencer Dinwiddie when there’s Kawhi Leonard, Tim Hardaway Jr, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Victor Oladipo, Dennis Schroder, Goran Dragic, Lonzo Ball then I don’t know what to tell you lmfaoo Spencer has torn his ACL twice, congrats on another 30 win season"

Serge’s career goes sideways in Orlando, OKC turns Dipo and Sabonis into PG for a few years and then Shai and more, Ersan into Jerami Grant"

Victor Oladipo if he can ever be healthy.
"This is not even close to true. To try and get KD stay, we were about to sign al Horford. We paid victor oladipo. We overpaid Steven Adams. We paid Paul George. We paid Russel westbrook. We paid Carmelo. We were in the luxury tax for years after KD left."
victor oladipo better
"Yeah if only we had Victor Oladipo and picks that are way worse than ours, that could even get us a James harden!"
Kemba Walker for Terry Rozier?  Victor Oladipo for Caris LeVert?  Kyle Korver for Copy Machine?  PG13 for SGA?
"I think it's safe to assume since there are a lot of shorter players who have quite better handles, speed, vertical and lateral quickness than KD, such as Bradley Beal, Victor Oladipo etc. the limits of their star status gives a good indication of where KD could end up, that's being most optimistic and giving him the benefit of the doubt that at 6'6 he would be comparable to these players.   Alternatively, if someone like DeRozan was 6'10 instead of 6'6 with a few points taken off from his other qualities, he'd definitely be a more effective and higher ranked player.   There's nothing wrong in accepting the fact that height plays a major role in any player's effectiveness and one might wonder if CP3 wasn't a 6' PG, but a few inches taller, what he could have accomplished.   These are all hypotheticals but they're based on what we can observe on the court, like Luka's physique, being thick and tall helps him a lot over smaller guards who try and defend him. BTW, Luka is no shorter than 6'8, look at some pics of him."
"Being in the paint makes that play much different to me. Barnett is jumping toward the hoop as much as he is toward Baylor, which on an 8 foot shot is not an unnatural thing to do.

Victor Oladipo
Victor Oladipo was on a season as well
"You gonna call me a clown? I’ve given stats and evidence to back up my claims and you gonna call me a clown cuz i dont agree with your claim? Real mature.   Now, again.  &gt;saying he wouldnt even get past a 48 win team led by Victor Oladipo.   You see, you’re not basing it on the way the team plays, but on the names on the team. Would you believe the 04 Lakers would lose to a Pistons team led by Chauncey Billups? Well they did, and that’s thanks to the gameplan. And also, the competition isnt the only one getting a downgrade. The fall off of Kd’s supporting cast is way larger than the downgrade in his competition.   &gt;And you know how exactly?  Well, simple. Because Kd aint gonna be passing him the ball as much as Lebron does. So he aint getting the same number of touches. Also, why are you gonna upgrade Jeff Green’s performance for Kd? He played terrible in the 1st round and was inconsistent with Lebron giving him many open looks. Ya think Kd is willing to pass him the ball as much as Lebron did? Again, watch game 7. Kd was taking nearly ALL the shots to close it out. He wasnt trusting his teammates to take the shots then, not even Harden, so why you think he gonna trust a supporting cast thats even worse?  &gt;Korver scored 18 on 75% TS  Your right, my bad. And that was the 1 game Lebron didnt score 40 points.   &gt;you keep spamming ppg.   Im giving you ppg and FG%. More of Kd’s teammates shot efficiently than Lebron’s, and more scored more points. We’re talking about how Kd would perform in Lebron’s situation, not comparing HOW they performed in different series. Ok, he scored 26.1% of his teams points. You think that’s gonna pass for a worse supporting cast? Lebron didnt score more % of the team’s points cuz he was actively trying to get others involved as well. Bron’s a playmaker, Kd’s a scorer. Kd aint gon be looking to make plays for his teammates. We saw in the Bucks series he was only looking to get shots for himself, and passed out to open shooters when he was doubled. That aint gonna cut it in a playoff game, let alone a playoff series."
"&gt; Lmao why are you compring them to Milwaukee when they aren’t the Cavs matchup?  Because KD in those last 4 games played as well (if not better) under similar circumstances vs a much better team. Yet you and all the clowns in this thread are saying he wouldn't even get past a 48 win team led by Victor Oladipo lmfao. Just put 2 and 2 together.  &gt; So KD aint gonna be playing with 27 points Jeff Green cuz he wouldnt and didnt show up in that series vs Pacers.   And you know that how exactly? Do you live in some alternative universe where KD underperformed vs the 2018 Pacers?    &gt; Man, you realize that was the 1 time a teammate played efficiently during the 7 games right?  Korver also scored 18 points on 75 TS% in a close game 4 to avoid going down 3-1   &gt; But how about the other 2 guys also averaging 10 a game?   I like how you keep spamming so and so player's PPG while completely ignoring the lower pace of the series lol. LeBron scored 27.5% of his team's points while KD scored 26.1%. But ya I'm sure that extra 1.4% that KD got from his teammates made all the difference, amiright?"
"Yeah the replies here are crazy and mad disrespectful. Lesser players like Kidd, Iverson, and Dwight all carried their teams to the finals playing in the East but Kevin fucking Durant can't?? He's really gonna lose to Victor Oladipo and Bogdanovic??   I guess the Warriors weren't that stacked then based on these people's logic lol"
"Tbh I find it pretty hard to pick a team led by Victor Oladipo over a team with any top tier superstar lmao  Same thing with the Raptors, the ""good team play but no superstar"" teams always get exposed in the playoffs, look at the Jazz this year  You need a top 5-10 player to actually win unless your team play is literally perfect, which the Pacers certainly weren't"
"When does Oladipo come back? Seems like they're loaded with him. Bam, Butler, Lowry, Victor... Then lots of great role players like Herro and Duncan. And Tucker*"
I got hammered with Luis Scola and Solomon Hill after a Pacers playoff game at a standard shitty tourist bar in downtown Indianapolis.  I also met Victor Oladipo just walking to go get lunch when he first got traded to Indianapolis and talked to him for a few because I had a class with him at IU back in the day.
"Managed a GameStop in Orlando for several years, met Darko Milicic, Hedo Turkoglu, Aaron Afflalo, Glenn Davis, Victor Oladipo, Tobias Harris. Tobias was genuinely one of the coolest guys. I would see him from time to time and he recognized me and we would shoot the shit. Let's Go Magic!!!"
"I just don't get the whole narrative around it  Shouldn't the second best player of all time BE EXPECTED to beat a team led by Victor Oladipo, DeMar DeRozan, or 19 year old Jayson Tatum who averaged 14 PPG that season, providing that his supporting cast isn't literally the Process Sixers(which they weren't?)  I've literally seen people bring his run up to say ""LeBron would have beat the Bucks this year/qualified from the playoffs in the West"" as a way to bash Durant or Curry but WHEN did LeBron beat a guy as good as Giannis all on his own, OR make the playoffs in the West with a horrible supporting cast(he tried to and failed in 2019?)"
2018 Cavs got taken to 7 games by the Victor Oladipo Pacers.......
Victor Oladipo
"Gee, Idk maybe because he averaged 6 points fewer along with one less rebound and assist in the postseason while they got swept. (2017)  In 2016, he actually didn't play too bad against the Cavs, except Kyrie averaged more assists and points while shooting a higher fg% (outplaying him).  In 2018, they got swept by a Cavs team who got taken to seven by the injured Boston Celtics, and the Victor Oladipo led Pacers.  It has been failure after failure for Kyle Lowry against Lebronto."
"His value is tied to what he's done, and he's collapsed in big moments. Will there be another big moment on the 76ers before he's traded?   Roy Hibbert had a ton of value as DPOY candidate, then was out of the league in 2 years.   Victor Oladipo was All-NBA just a couple years ago, and just signed to a minimum.   Markelle Fultz was a #1 pick and 2 years later traded for a bench piece plus a highly protected pick.   You can say all GMs have goldfish memories, or recognize that as the information changes the perceptions change."
Dennis Schroder and Victor Oladipo are punching air right now.
"Because Victor Oladipo was giving them fits, so I can only imagine what Harden and CP3 could do."
Agreed. Athleticism doesn’t necessarily translate. Also never knew Pay Conn had bunnies like THAT jesus. Here’s a cool [link](https://hoopshype.com/lists/best-leapers-nba-victor-oladipo/) to the biggest leapers in the draft. Not a single prolific talent.

"An above-average starter is somewhere in the top 60-ish players in the league, so you're still getting paid very well even if you never make an All-Star team.   I think the better question would be something along the lines of would you rather have the career of someone like Evan Fournier, or Victor Oladipo?"
There is a very good chance that Jalen Green will be a big improvement over the guys who he is replacing (Victor Oladipo and Sterling Brown)
hate to say it but… Victor Oladipo
"And yet instead of some meh offer for Harden, Rockets ultimately ended up with Victor Oladipo and a 4 late first round picks (2022 bucks, 2022 2024 and 2026 nets picks, and 4 pick swaps (1 already didn't happen, 2 more most likely worthless KD and Harden under contract until 2025, and the last 1 likely worthless if KD, Harden or Kyrie bother to extend regardless of how lucky rockets get in the draft.)"
"And ultimately wound up with Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen and nets draft picks which they converted into Victor Oladipo and Cavs 2022 pick and Nets draft picks."
"&gt; Lots of freshman and sophomores have had his level of success  Name freshman other than Kevin Durant and Michael Beasley that have.  &gt;By those measurements he was not even top 10 within the year he played  Do you mean players in the country? That basically never happens for freshmen in P5, especially not if you aren't playing on Kentucky/Duke/Gonzaga/a powerhouse school at the time.  &gt;Someone like Zion the next year was an actual all-time dominating force in college  Playing at a powerhouse with pretty much an entire roster better than the 2nd best player on Trae's team.  &gt;Trae is only an all-time talent if you count exclusively by raw point and assist totals and ignore literally everything else.  Yes, volume and situation both actually matter lmao.  The list of players with Trae's intersection of volume, situation, and efficiency is incredibly small.   Zion played on one of the most talented teams in the country under the best college coach of all-time, on a team that cranks out hyperefficient seasons on a regular basis. Zion was a notch above their typical hyperefficiency, but Marvin Bagley was 21/11 on 64.3% TS, and Jahlil Okafor was 17/8.5 on 64.1% TS.  Like you've done multiple times already, you completely miss the significance of the landscape of college basketball.   &gt;58% TS is good but not amazing for college.  27.4ppg on 58.5% TS is absurd lmao, its literally mind-meltingly good. That's why I wanted you to look up all the previous top PG draft picks so you could grasp how much of an outlier Trae's production was.   Lonzo Ball: 14.6ppg  De'Aaron Fox: 16.7ppg  Ben Simmons: 19.2ppg  D'Angelo Russell: 19.3ppg  Marcus Smart(soph): 18ppg  Victor Oladipo(junior): 13.6ppg  Damian Lillard(senior in non-P5): 24.5ppg  Kyrie Irving(11 games): 17.5ppg  John Wall: 16.6ppg  Tyreke Evans(non-P5): 17.1ppg  Steph Curry(junior, non-P5): 28.6ppg  Derrick Rose(non-P5): 14.9ppg  Russell Westbrook: 12.7ppg  The only PG close to Trae's volume was Curry, and he did it as a Sophomore and Junior in a non-P5 conference. Trae doing it on great efficiency on top of it is ridiculous.   Doing what Trae did as a freshman in the P5 on a non-powerhouse is as close as it gets to outright unheard of. The only comparables are Beasley and Durant.    &gt;Many guys are regularly well over 60% even on high volume.  Not Guards, not Freshmen, not on Trae's volume, not in the Power 5, and not at non-powerhouse schools.   &gt;Also, Trae’s TS% was hugely uplifted by shooting a ton of free throws, which is another thing many college guys struggle to bring over to the NBA.  That's the opposite of true. FT attempts are one of the stickiest stats, if not the actual stickiest from college to the NBA. Rim attempts and FT attempts are two of the biggest predictors of NBA success and Trae was elite at both."
Just Harden would have been enough to demolish that Cavs team. They got pushed to the brink by teams led by Victor Oladipo and rookie Tatum.
"&gt; but not otherwordly  But they were otherworldly lol. He was literally the first player in NCAA history in scoring and assists and did it as a freshman, on top of having the highest-scoring freshman season ever at a Power 5 school, and he did it on great efficiency.   &gt;Again, you can look at Steph as a comparion. Steph is small but is actually taller and longer than Trae. And his efficiency and advanced stats in college were significantly better than Trae.  How about looking at De'Aaron Fox, D'Angelo Russell, Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley, etc.  Even if you want to die on the hill of comparing Trae to the college career of the GOAT shooter:  Steph's freshman year he put up 21.5/4.6/2.8 on 61.7% TS in the Southern Conference against a -2.26 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year he put up 27.4/3.9/8.7 on 58.5% TS in the Big 12 against a 10.56 rated strength of schedule.  Trae's freshman year was still more impressive when you contextualize it.   &gt;but taking a guy like Steph is still a gamble.  This is a moronic take."

"Help, I'm being catfished by someone pretending to be Victor Oladipo!"
"He should just wear a costume, but one that doesn't let people know he's Victor Oladipo"
"this is awesome, please let me know if/when victor oladipo becomes your brother-in-law"
Victor oladipo had a crush on my sister like 10 years ago and she turned him down so I’m shooting her shot for her through Reddit
"If we’re talking players who have been all stars, other than the ones people have already mentioned maybe DeMarcus Cousins and Victor Oladipo?"
"what in the fuck yes he did  his biggest competition the past few years in the east was a teenage jayson tatum, demar derozan, kyle lowry, victor oladipo, and a young paul george  you gotta be smoking nuts to think he wasn't in the absolute weakest conference all those years  plus on top of that the dude would get to the finals and LOSE to the western team more times than not"
"Victor Oladipo was immediately an All Star the second he left the Thunder (he also made All-NBA once but I think it was a bit flukey). Westbrook wasnt carrying a garbage squad, he had an insane USG rate and didnt really run a offense conducive to team success"
"The OP purposely left out large parts of the article. Other important information  &gt; That accept-the-qualifying-offer, bet-on-yourself tactic—in addition to client-poaching from other agents—has drawn ire from Paul's rivals in the agency world. To be fair, they are often guilty of the same activities; a significant portion of income for larger agencies is generated by poaching clients before a player's next lucrative deal.  &gt;The National Basketball Players Association does not prohibit certified agents from contacting other certified agents' clients, a noted contrast to the NBA's tampering rules, prohibiting team executives from contacting rival teams' talent. That stance has frustrated many agents for years.  &gt;And it's not just Paul.  &gt;Sources told Bleacher Report that Victor Oladipo was influenced to leave longtime representative Aaron Turner of Versus Management for Excel Sports just before free agency this summer. Excel gave Oladipo the same sales pitch: a new agent can deliver more money than the previous one. In this case, like Noel's, they didn't deliver.  &gt;Back in 2017, Robert Covington left his agent Chris Patrick (who helped land the two-way forward his first legitimate NBA stop in Philadelphia) for behemoth CAA Sports ahead of signing a four-year, $62 million deal.  &gt;Oladipo and Covington are merely two of a long list of examples.  &gt;The union has never shown much interest in policing such backchanneling. But a popular solution often mentioned by agents is saving 1 percent of the commission on a player's next contract for the previous representative, which would likely require some form of arbitration.  &gt;""It is wild to see all of it aired out like this,"" another veteran agent said. ""It happens all the time, but it never becomes public. It happens around the draft even. Guys will say anything to convince these players to come.""  &gt;Maybe these headlines do go away and Noel's filing was simply a public gesture against the agent he feels wronged him. ""I'll pay you this 200 grand, but I'm gonna s--t in your cornflakes before I do,"" one representative who previously worked with Noel said.  &gt;The majority of league sources contacted by B/R do expect the union to settle some type of agreement between these two parties, being that a legitimate legal battle benefits neither Klutch nor Noel. For Noel to win $58 million in alleged lost salary, he would seemingly face a daunting uphill battle in a court of law.  &gt;""The truth is Nerlens is not innocent in this,"" another agent said. ""If you're silly enough to turn down that kind of money, that's not on Rich.""  &gt;Paul's defense would be simple: An agent can never be held accountable for accurately predicting the future. He was providing a client with counsel, counsel that Noel did not have to accept, and if Noel did not suffer an injury, he very well could have garnered a richer deal.  &gt;That following summer, in 2018, Clint Capela scored a five-year, $90 million contract from the Rockets, a solid payday for a bouncy pick-and-roll threat and rim-protector of similar ilk.  &gt;Noel's case relies on the argument that Paul did not act in Noel's best interest, that Paul had no part in pitching the center to the Thunder in 2018 or sufficiently marketing him to other teams the following seasons.  &gt;It likely would be very challenging, however, for Noel's defense to find a team figure willing to come forward and confirm that series of events as a witness at trial. It's a sensitive topic that multiple league personnel declined to comment on for this article."
"&gt; Lol y’all literally forget how bad that thunder squad really was. All of them are bums now except brook.  Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Jerami Grant, Steven Adams...  Wtf are you talking about?  Sabonis was literally an All-Star *this year* my guy."
"If you don’t think dudes that don’t live up to potential still don’t get paid because they’re a high lottery pick and someone out there thinks the team they were previously on “just didn’t know how to utilize them properly”, then I don’t know what to tell you.   Seriously, go read the threads where Nerlens Noel turned down 4 years/$70 million because he thought he could get $100 million, even though the one he turned down was a huge overpay based off his production already.  Also, every team thinks their staff is better equipped to get that potential out. They all believe they can get their own Victor Oladipo (pre injury)."
"It really makes you wonder why Rich Paul specifically gets so much shit. I mean, how many people here have ever even heard of the agents of Dennis Schroder or Victor Oladipo? Didn't those guys also turn down huge money and lose out? I've never seen people saying they should sue their agents, instead people say that *they*, not their agents, screwed up.   Why is Nerlens Noel suddenly absolved of his part in that decision and it's all on Rich Paul? You'll note that Noel's former agent doesn't say ""Rich Paul passed"" he says *Nerlens* did. And why is it that everyone knows with apparently intimidate detail every deal Rich Paul has been a part of? Is it cause he's black? Is it because he's associated with LeBron? Both? Why is this such a big story around here for so many people? I can't help but feel like there is some extra subtext that everyone here is tiptoing around."
"It's unfortunate but that's a big part of where the hate for Rich Paul comes from. Not from everyone, of course. Some people hate him cause they just hate LeBron and everything associated with him, but it's upsetting how much everyone focuses on this one agent like this. I think it's interesting that we haven't seen anyone talking about the agents for Dennis Schroder or Victor Oladipo, but people have been talking about Rich Paul and Noel for years before this. With Dennis Schroder, it seems like most people feel like Schroder made a big mistake, but with Noel everyone seems to think Rich Paul is responsible. Can't help but wonder why."
"In hindsight all those trades are godawful, I’m not denying that. But Harden with the Rockets was in his prime, fresh off of however many consecutive first team all-NBA appearances and top 3 MVP finishes, and they traded him for KPJ, Victor Oladipo (who they’d later flip for Avery Bradley and Kelly fucking Olynyk), and some future picks that will all be late first rounders most likely.   Kobe, Pippen, and so one were all rookies that hadn’t been drafted yet, so there was no guarantee how good they’d be. Everyone knew how good Harden is, and they still traded him for chump change, then somehow made their take even worse."
Fine. I'll make an All-Washed team:   **PG:** Chris Paul   **SG:** Victor Oladipo  **SF:** LeBron James   **PF:** Carmelo Anthony  **C:** Draymond Green
You mean Victor Oladipo? Or you mean Nerlens Noel?
"Because of coaching and underpreforming players. We Sabonis being a spot up big and Victor Oladipo was playing like he plays now but worse. Those where the other two options on that team. People don't understand how fucking terrible that shit was. Also Hardens advanced stats where also good but the triple double counts, russ completed some shit people never thought could ever happen again period that counts for something. Harden had some pretty decent guys on that roster looking back too that where performing. Capelam Dekker, Montrezl, Ariza, Ryan Andersons last good year, Lou Williams etc.  People just read off Houston fanboy arguments and don't look at the context. We dead ass had Oladipo and Sabonis as spot up shooters  next to Steven Adams and Roberson and Billy Donovans trash ass not knowing what to do."
* Aaron Gordon * Mario Hezonja * Victor Oladipo * Elfrid Payton * Domantas Sabonis  The sample size and pattern here cannot be ignored.
"&gt;Yawn. It’s 2021, can’t use anything but TS% anymore  According to [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) there were only 6 qualified players in the NBA last year with a worse TS% than Wall.  &gt;I mean, if you wanna talk about why his assists were down last year, maybe start with the trash teammates he had who couldn’t hit shots.  Here's a list of players on the rockets last year who played significant minutes (500+) and had a better TS% than John Wall: Kelly Olynyk, Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr., Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks, David Nwaba, KPJ, Danuel House, Boogie Cousins, and Victor Oladipo. The only two who were less efficient than him in that many minutes were noted offensive sparkplugs PJ Tucker and Ben McLemore. Talk all you want about how his assist numbers would be better if he didn't have ""trash teammates who couldn't hit shots"", but I find that really hard to take when almost everyone on the team is out shooting him.  Would his efficiency be better if he didn't have to carry so much offensive load on a shitty team? Yeah, probably. Would it be *significantly* better? I don't see why it would be. John walls main role on a team will always been as an offensive engine. He's not a dynamic off ball player, especially not at this point in his career.  If he were to get 6th man minutes on a good team, he could probably put up more efficient numbers on 50-60% of his current volume, but the fact of the matter is that no contending team is going to give 6th man minutes to a relatively inefficient scorer who can't defend effectively anymore, even if he was on a much cheaper deal."
Totally forgot Victor Oladipo is still on the Heat...
"I feel like there is a real misunderstanding of just how bad it is for players to be playing through knee soreness. If you go back and look at most horrific knee injuries players have had in recent years, they are often preceded by players reporting soreness in that same knee in the weeks prior but continuing to play on it.   The ones that really stand out to me are Kristaps Porzingis with the Knicks, Andre Roberson with the Thunder and Victor Oladipo with the Pacers. All three guys were sitting out games with and complaining about knee soreness right before their major knee injuries (ACL with Porzingis, patellar tendon rupture with Roberson and quad tendon rupture with Oladipo). Knee soreness is a sign that something is wrong, and if you play through it, it doesn't get better, it only risks getting worse."

Help is the key word. The player still has to own their decisions.   Do you blame the agent for Victor Oladipo or Dennis Schroeder?
"Lol, media speculating does not equal they've been in trade talks.   I'm not the biggest Pritchard fan, but to his credit that Front Office does not leak. No leaks before the PG trade, the Victor Oladipo trade, nothing before the Rick Carlisle signing, etc."
Victor Oladipo before injuries ruined him
They're really out here comparing Victor Oladipo and rookie Jayson Tatum to fucking Giannis and Embiid. Can't make this shit up lol
"Not *the* saddest, but it hurt pretty bad to see IU grad and “This Is My City” Victor Oladipo hugging &amp; laughing with the Heat players seconds after each of our 4 straight playoff losses in ‘19. Then it broke shortly after that he was openly asking Heat players, and several other teams who didn’t make playoffs, to trade for him in front of his teammates.   Layer that in with how the year before in ‘18 the [referees admitted they missed a game clenching goaltend on Lebron ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/news/nba-says-referees-missed-lebron-james-goaltending-call-game-5%3famp=1) vs the Heat. Go even farther back and think about all the years of PG vs the Heat in the playoffs &amp; 2013 ECF.   We hate the Heat. Victor couldn’t have picked a worse team to shamelessly beg players to go to."
"That’s debatable. He scraped by a Celtics team who were lucky to escape a first round series against a team whose third best player in the series was Thon Maker, after himself scraping by Victor Oladipo the one year he was good + role players. Again, this was not a good year for the East."
The final vote came down to Victor Oladipo.

"I just don't see him getting the minutes. He averaged 17 ppg in 34 mpg last year. He will be turning 36 years old and competing for minutes with Tyler Herro, Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo and then a slew of rotation guards.   Last year Butler played 34 mpg, Oladipo was at 28 mpg (recovering from injury so possibly expect an increase in mpg this year), Herro averaged around 31 mpg, and Vincent and Strus were around 13 mpg each in bench roles. Assuming he fills the Goran Dragic role (26 mpg) I'd be shocked if he averaged 15+ ppg. Even if he got more mpg, Miami has a lot of scoring options, I just don't see Lowry needing to score all that much.   Last year only 2 players averaged 15+ ppg at age 35+, they were LeBron James and Chris Paul. Lowry is great but he's obviously a tier or two below LeBron and Paul. Paul played 32 mpg last year and was also an All Star and All NBA 2nd team the past two years. Lowry as good as he is, is still a ways behind Chris Paul."
"A small-ball lineup of Kyle Lowry, Victor Oladipo, Duncan Robinson, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo could be very interesting. The regular lineup with PJ could effectively do the same, but his shooting has been terrrrible recently."
Victor Oladipo was there too and solid on offense
"Compared to Victor Oladipo?  &amp;#x200B;  A very substancial amount. Remember that had the Rockets had the third worst record in the league instead of the first or second, they would've dropped to 5 and sent the pick to OKC. Magic had the third best odds, they dropped to 5.  &amp;#x200B;  Its pretty telling when you can ask any Rockets fan pretty much what package they would take, in hindsight, and they would all answer the same.  &amp;#x200B;  Not forgetting that, also, Philly's FRP's are worth less than the Nets because of the age of their core compared to BRK, in 2026, I would rather have a Nets pick than a Philly one, thats what I'm saying, assuming Harden would be on both teams."
"Danny Granger, Paul George, Victor Oladipo, TJ Warren, Caris Levert...jeez they really have had some terrible injury luck."

"&gt;	According to a report by Windhorst, Ramona Shelburne and Dave McMenamin, the Cavaliers, Pacers and Denver Nuggets discussed a trade that would have sent Love to Denver, George to Cleveland and assets including Gary Harris and the draft's 13th pick to Indiana.  &gt;	The reporters also noted general manager Kevin Pritchard reneged when ""the Cavs were just starting to celebrate.""  &gt;	Pritchard and the Pacers moved on and flipped George to the Thunder for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis.  Youre stupid."
or you could've gotten Jarrett Allen/Caris but decided to get Victor Oladipo who you traded away for 2 dudes who aren't even on the team anymore
"There’s a large number of NBA players who have accredited their improvements to playing alongside Russ.   They directly said seeing his work ethic in practice and his leadership inspired them to become better. This happened with Paul George, Victor Oladipo, and more.   He would also help get their young guys easier looks, teach them more how to win, and all kinds of stuff.   Do you seriously think having vets provide no upside to a locker room or a young players development?"
"Maybe doesn't fit exactly, (he isn't a superstar) and there are for sure worse examples, but I don't believe Oladipo gets enough shit for how dirty he did the Pacers.  The Pacers fully embraced Oladipo after the Paul George fiasco and him forcing his way out. Oladipo being an IU alumni, the fans accepted him immediately as if he was an old friend. They were quick to embrace Oladipo's ""This is my city"" phrase after he hit a game winner early in his first season with the team (the best season of his career might I add). Victor gave a hope to Pacers fans in a time where there was little hope to be had after the team that had so much success in the mid 2010's was blown up. There was real talk that the Pacer's had actually won the Paul George trade with how well Oladipo played in the 2018 season.  After battling injuries in the 2019 and 2020 seasons, Oladipo returned to a team that had the other half of the PG trade ascend into an all star caliber player in Sabonis. Pacers fans believed these two players could be the building blocks of the future, only being 28 and 24 years old respectively. What does Oladipo do? He openly asks [""Can I come play with ya'll""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/jsxseu/michael_victor_oladipo_asked_the_raptors_heat_and/) in front of his teammates and forces a trade out of Indiana.   In the end, I guess it didn't work out to badly for the Pacers, Oladipo continues to battle injuries and they got Caris LaVert from trading him. It just felt so shitty for Oladipo to turn around and do the exact same thing that led him to being traded to the Pacers.  tl;dr Oladipo was embraced by the Pacers fans and gave them hope in a bad trade situation only to turn around and do the exact same thing."
"s/o to when I was downvoted for saying Lowry wouldn't be a 17 &amp; 7 player this year.   &gt;he averaged 17 &amp; 7 for a 27 win team. He will be turning 36 years old this season and all of his advanced stats painted him as a pretty average player last season. He's not washed in the sense that he's useless, but folks expecting him to be an all star caliber guy are in for a surprise. I think he probably averages \~11 &amp; 6 this year.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;I just don't see him getting the minutes. He averaged 17 ppg in 34 mpg last year. He will be turning 36 years old and competing for minutes with Tyler Herro, Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo and then a slew of rotation guards.

"There’s much more evidence than just Chris Hayes.  Keith Pompey who is well sourced reported the Sixers believed a deal was in place, Simmons and Thybulle were informed to expect an announcement, and the Rockets switched to the Nets package at the final hour.  It’s hard to fault them for failing to engage a non rational actor in Tillman.  The Rockets chose Victor Oladipo over that, plus a bunch of swaps that won’t convey.  The firsts from 2025-2027 might be good, but that’s literally it.  They traded a top 10 player and don’t have a single young player to show for it, and will probably get a pick in the high 20s this year and nothing next year. It was the worst return for a superstar in recent memory."

It was more along the lines of, ‘We know you’re not going to accept it, but we still want you to understand that we want you here.’ It was more that gesture, than anything. Didn’t go out of my way to ask, or anything like that. It was just kind of put in front of me, or given to me, to show that they want me to be here. &gt;  &gt; I didn’t get a chance to say yes or no.

"People are not making a big enough deal out of the basketball switch this season. NBA 3-point percentage league-wide has been its worse in almost two decades.   But I will say this, as a Heat fan, I don’t like seeing Duncan Robinson average 30 minutes per game. He has to shoot 40+ percent from 3 to justify him even being on the court. He’s not. The Heat have to make a switch to Victor Oladipo or even consider moving Herro into the starting lineup over Robinson. Something has to change and soon because he’s costing Miami games by getting up 11-12 3s and not being close to even 36 percent from 3."

"yeah, a good way to put it in short is that you can either have Gabe Vincent and Caleb Martin playing NBA basketball in a Miami Heat jersey, or you can try out a fully rehabilitated Victor Oladipo and whatever that may entail.  it's not a fucking question"
"Because even if a player doesn't come back 100%, they're still back and healthy relatively?  We literally don't even need Oladipo and he's expected to come back and cook benches until he's ready to play playoff basketball, and we're not even over tax for having him while not needing him.  You trying to imagine a world where the Miami Heat somehow only get marginally better if not worse for replacing Caleb Martin with Victor Oladipo for 40-60 games is what truly takes an imagination."
"Victor Oladipo coming in for us in any reliable manner definitely will require a strong imagination. So many Heat fans are treating this guy like he’s just going to come back and be fine as if he’s not an infamously chronically injured player. Why is that, what am I missing?"
"Imagine starting the game with your 5 best players against the Heat. Now your Starters need rest and so does the Heat. But fucking Tyler Herro, Victor Oladipo and a Morris twin enter the game against your 15ppg bench."
Remember: Victor Oladipo is on this team
"This Miami team is serious. These guys are adding freaking victor oladipo.   This team looks complete right now and they’re adding a guy who was just an allstar a while ago.  I had them pencilled in at pretender status underestimating what adding a finishing piece like lowry adds to teams.   Not being forced to handle and pass all game opens up Jimmy and Herro a lot, and helps Bam."
This Miami team is adding Victor Oladipo at some point. And they have his bird rights.  That is all.
Victor Oladipo?

Ok?  and I’m still taking Victor Oladipo over Malcolm Brogdon.
"Hmm Tyler Johnson vs Victor Oladipo. I don't see the difference.  Come on now, your argument is silly."

"""That was a bad shot"" -Victor Oladipo, probably"
"Victor Oladipo prior to the injury?  I’m still rooting for him, but he hasn’t come close to what he was"
His style honestly reminds me of James Harden but he won’t be as good obviously. I think he could be a tier B star like victor oladipo pre injury. I’m not worried about his shooting splits. Zach LaVine for instance had god awful ones and was regarded to be one of the worst players in the nba his rookie year. Edwards has a good stroke so I’m not that concerned. His shot selection will improve. He shoots decent from the line.  Right now he gets absolutely hammered driving to the rack and is learning to just play into the contact instead of using his insane athleticism to go around it and put up a bad shot. He’s still learning what works and doesn’t in the nba as he’s been a player so athletically gifted that college scrubs couldn’t impede him. I think his big question will be can he put it all together.
"Lu Dort  Hear me out before downvoting. He's definitely a great contract value but I see as many or more posts/highlights for him than guys like Victor Oladipo, Kristaps Porzingis, Nikola Vucevic, Jerami Grant, Brandon Ingram, KAT, DeAndre Ayton, De'Aaron Fox, etc."
I had two thoughts about the Pacers coming into this season.  Victor Oladipo is overrated based on one good year and not worth anything close to a max and Myles turner was just a shot blocker and not good a good defender.  I was wrong on one of those.
Harden to the rockets for 2 frp+victor oladipo who says no

"Kemba is a 4 time all star. He didn’t have “1 good season”.  Victor oladipo actually did have 1 good season.  He hasn’t averaged above 20 since his MIP year. He also has a much worse injury history than kemba, given that he’s missed most of the past 2 seasons with various injuries.   You’re smoking if you think that dipo is more valuable than kemba on the FA market.   You need to stop being a homer and get over the fact that Houston got no rings out of harden, and now has no real prospects of value (outside of wood) and no future.   Nobody is bailing you out with multiple picks for a guy who is an average starter at this point. Certainly not pat Riley."
"Kemba was coming off of an all nba second team.   Victor oladipo just got traded for caris levert.   He’s also come out and said he’d like to play for the heat. He has essentially 0 trade value for any other team.   The heat are not offering the rockets 2 firsts and a second for the right to sign him to a 20 m a year deal. This is because unlike you, pat riley does not have a mental disability that would make him value oladipo that much.   &gt;the Celtics need to sign vuc  The Celtics best players are 22 and 24. They don’t need to make any sudden moves. If they do, they might end up looking like the rockets now, with no future and not much draft capital.   Ideas like this are why you post comically bad trades on reddit while Danny ainge picks a team with 2 U25 all nba players"
Nobody is paying up a big contract for victor oladipo anyways and the Celtics can pick up a starter with the TPE instead. They don’t need to be giving out charitable contributions to the rockets to sign a guy who shoots 40% from the field.
"I miss Victor Oladipo.I’m glad We got LeVert I loved him on those DLow nets teams but Oladipo will always be my favorite player, can’t wait to him and John wall get bounced out together by Bron in the first round of the playoffs."
[Wojnarowski] Victor Oladipo and Thaddeus Young are placed into quarantine for violating health and safety protocol
"I lived in Bloomington when he was at iu and I hate the Hoosiers but i secretly loved oladipo he was a beast and from all accounts a great guy. Me and my roommate both worked on campus and he would come home talking about the  players, he worked in the athletics dept, always had something good to say about victor."
"Or more accurately:  &gt;Did we win?  """"  &gt;Did we lose?  ""Trash ass bum. Raptors should trade him for Victor Oladipo."""
"Other teams see him as the second best player next to your true star right now, so that return would be akin to what Victor Oladipo brings in rather than a boatload of picks. I'm not sure when the switch is supposed to be flipped on Simmons, but we're waiting."
I think if the sixers made Simmons available right now they would get a better return than an expiring Victor Oladipo and pick swaps
You ended up with an expiring Victor Oladipo contract and a ton of picks in the high 20’s. Instead of a 2 time all star with 5 years on his contract lmao

How does not Victor Oladipo not have star ability?
"It wouldn’t do anything. It really wouldn’t.   Even guys who often shoot outside willingly as the focal point of an offense like Brandon Ingram, LeBron, or Victor Oladipo don’t get the super hard closeout treatment. You treat all of those guys as drivers first and close out 2 steps short because they’re league average shooters and if they’re taking a high volume of 3s instead of doing what they do better (I.e, attacking the rim) you’re fine living with how bad they hurt you.  Guys like Giannis, Elfrid Peyton, or Ben Simmons are honestly better going downhill more and attacking the basket or distributing the ball to actual shooters."
TIL his name is Kehinde Babatunde Victor Oladipo
"In that trade they got 8 picks, and the expiring they now have is Victor Oladipo (which they got for trading away Levert, who is not an expiring and is considered great value on his contract). Not really the same as Otto Porter  I'd prefer the rights to 2 Nets picks than 2 sixers picks, so the only real asset you end up with is 2 frp from one of those teams. Especially because it appears that a large motivation for the Rockets was to get under the tax, which it's not clear that your deal would do  Why are you assuming that Lavine can be swapped for 2 picks?  So your logic is that through multiple assumptions, Simmons must have been offered for expirings and a couple first round picks, which you're assuming that those teams turned down. And since you're assuming that Lavine could be acquired for 2 picks, that therefore means that Simmons is a fair trade for Lavine?  That's a lot to build an argument on. My argument is that multiple of your assumptions are likely not true (and only one needs to be for your argument to not make sense), and that Ben Simmons is better than Zach Lavine at basketball while being on a better contract  You heard of Occam's razor?"
On the bright side Pacers are like forbidden to not have a star by the laws of physics. As soon as their star leaves/injures another one materialises out of thin air.  It's an unbroken chain Danny Granger to Paul George to Victor Oladipo to Damontis Sabonis.
You sound dumb. So Mario Hezonja and Mo Bamba were good draft picks? Fran Vasquez was a good pick? lmao Trading Victor Oladipo for Serge Ibaka and then flipping him for Terrance Ross was a good decision?  Go play in traffic. You whole opinion is idiotic.
"One major reason if they Pacers are confident this is a minor delay in LeVert playing,  accepting the trade and waiting, for the good of them makes more sense than trying to bring back a now traded Victor Oladipo. Then attempting to smooth everything over."
Technically they did get levert they just instantly traded him for Victor oladipo
"Thats not my point. I could care less how good the team was in the finals. But what Im trying to say is like you people say Jordan had easier competition when in reality 3 of the 4 series Jordan played teams way better. Jordan was player teams with 2 stars to more on every team he went up against. Going up against Victor Oladipo was was borderline top 20 is laughable. Saying Lebron had better comp in the finals is true. But its not like he had Dwade, bosh, ray allen, kyrie, Love, AD. He went up against super teams but he was apart of one himself."
"Ya no shit he's injured and pending ufa--does the name victor oladipo mean anything you?  C'mon man--the rockets are tanking, any team can use a dinwiddie, and they *still* coulda landed him, landed dipo and offered both new deals.  If they reject they're in the same place.  Don't tell that wouldn't be worth, say one of the useless swaps or this year's pick."

Victor Oladipo is kinda special I suppose
"Yeah instead you got Victor Oladipo, who’s 28 and injury prone, and who your cheap owner reportedly wants to get rid of to save salary anyways... but maybe with one of those 4 draft picks you could land a player like maybe say Ben Simmons, who is only 24, an all-star, and one of the best defenders and passers in the league."
No no you're right. Caris Levert or a washed up Victor Oladipo will take you MUCH further than a 24 year old all star.
"He’s as Nigerian as Victor Oladipo, when was the last time anybody called him anything other than American?"
"Yes because your the 14. Seed now and just traded you best player for Victor Oladipo, this obviously means you will jump 8 other teams in the standings. Rockets ain’t making the playoffs."
I think they got the better deal all the same. Wouldn't you rather have 4 1sts and 4 pick swaps and Victor Oladipo + Exum then Ben Simmons?
"Four firsts, four pick swaps, and Victor Oladipo"
"&gt;That means he thinks he'd never played with anybody who could, and he played with LeBron   I understand that if you take those words very literally then that's what it means, but in reality, he didn't say a word about LeBron. It's very possible that he didn't think the response through all the way.  &gt;Over the last four years, the Celtics made it to the conference finals every year except the yea Kyrie played.   Again, I know that. My point is you can't pin that solely on Kyrie. When you have 8 guys who need shots and the ball to be effective on offense, that's a recipe for disaster.  &gt;And the Cavs got just as far without Kyrie the year he left as they did the year before with him.   Uhhh, wrong? They won the Finals with Kyrie and lost without him. Also, they made light work of their Eastern Conference opponents in 2017, only losing one game on the way to the Finals, but in 2018 they were taken to two Game 7's, including in the first round to a team led by Victor Oladipo.  &gt;And 20 games is a quarter on the season. That's not a small   It is. Especially when it's a given player's first 20 games with a new team. Especially when those games are scattered throughout the season and not all in a row. Besides, sample sizes have to be at least 30 to be considered significant in most statistical studies.  &gt;he got them in the playoffs back-to-back years when they weren't expected to. There was no reason to fire him, other than   Did you ignore my argument regarding this? Kyrie had nothing to do with it and that's undebatable. Also, as a Nets fan who's seen probably about 200 games that Kenny Atkinson has coached, he's not a perfect coach. His rotations are questionable, he gives too many minutes to undeserving players, and he is unable or unwilling to make adjustments to his schemes."
"I feel that way some days, other days I see victor Oladipo and 7 picks vs DeRozan, Poetl, and 1 pick. I like our young guys. I'm just disappointed because teams get so much more for so much less. Rudy couldn't grab a first from someone who needs a 4? LMA couldn't get us a late first last year when he was making his 3s? Of course we don't know. I don't think the Lakers deal was real because they felt they would get him in FA. It just makes me sad because we traded a top 5 player for way less than Jrue Holiday."
"He was an all star but had a huge drop off.   * 2018: 23/5/4 and 2.5 spg on 58% TS * 2019: 19/5/5 and 1.7 spg on 52% TS only 38 games played  East all stars were really weak that year. You had Nikola Vucevic, Victor Oladipo and D'angelo Russel all making it (not bad players by any means) and in the West you had Donovan Mitchell, Luka Dončić, Rudy Gobert, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond Green, Mike Conley and Marc Gasol all missing out. If he's in the West he's pretty solidly behind most of the aforementioned players and doesn't come close to a 2nd all star appearance."
"Y'all forget about Victor Oladipo? He's a pretty good defender and is more all around, with him having incredible bounce and speed he makes it difficult to get past him and is probably one of the best blockers currently at the guard positions."
"Good job, Rancid Fritatta, you turned James Harden into [checks notes] a one year rental of Victor Oladipo and picks."
"Agree with Miami on this. They’re not just trading salary filler, which is productive rotation pieces for this year, but they’re also trading their 2021 cap space (aka Victor Oladipo) in the trade as well, which is an overpay.  If they would drop Duncan out of the trade, I would have taken it though."
I’m looking at the top guys that are going to get dealt is....  1. Kyle Lowry  2. DeMar DeRozan  3. Andre Drummond  4. John Collins  5. Victor Oladipo
\*has john wall and victor oladipo\* calls it a shit year. smh
The top players would get the biggest contracts from the big markets anyway. All this leads to is the Cavs paying Victor Oladipo 70 million a year to get swept in the first round perennially

The Caris LeVert for Victor Oladipo trade gotta be the most aesthetically named trade of all time
He is.  Have you watched Oladipo this year.  This is who he is.  He will never be 2018 Victor ever again.  He has flashes and the jumper still looks great but he is no longer one of the fastest end to end players in the world.  He is no longer an all nba level defender and his passing is hit or miss.  He gets to the rim but he has to settle for lower accuracy layups instead of his athletic contact finishes that gets to the line.
I was about to reply saying Lavert is also pretty darn good himsef but they traded him for Victor “gib me max contract even tho im playing average” Oladipo so yeah idk wtf Houston is doing
Caris Levert is going to be what Victor Oladipo should have been.
"Yep, John Wall, Victor Oladipo, and Boogie Cousins insane big 3  It's 2017 right?"
It's just insane to me when you compare it to the Jrue Holday compensation Jrue Holiday got 3 picks(2 unprotected) 2 pick swaps George Hill and Eric Bledsoe while James Harden got 4 unprotected picks 4 swaps and Victor Oladipo. I dont buy the leverage thing either everybody knew NOP wanted to trade Jrue last offseason also.   The Denver thing to me you just cant pass up an opportunity like this at this price if you are a small market team. If MPJ or Murray are off the table in a Harden discussion it just means you arent actually serious about trying to win a title.
"The Houston Rockets turned James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Covington into Victor Oladipo, John Wall, Christian Wood 7 first round picks and 4 pick swaps"
"No doubt, Pacers are my second team (weird ik but I live here now) and I'm an IU alum also, so it's very sad to see Victor go. I think it's best for both parties as Pacers get a young player and Oladipo hopefully gets that big(ger) payday. Hopefully this city always has love for him though- I know I will."
And Victor Oladipo too.
"""The Rockets will receive four first-round picks and four-pick swaps, all unprotected.

Rockets really traded James harden and pick swaps for Victor Oladipo... fire that gm
"rockets fucking suck lol, yall might think this is good, but even victor oladipo and 4 protected 1st round picks is a HORRIBLE haul for the rockets"
"The Nets sent Houston a package that includes multiple players and draft picks and features guard Caris LeVert, who was then traded to the Pacers for Victor Oladipo, sources tell ESPN.  Center Jarrett Allen and forward Taurean Prince are headed from the Nets to the Cavs in the deal, according to sources, while the Rockets receive Cleveland guard Dante Exum and Brooklyn forward Rodions Kurucs  Houston also receives Brooklyn's three unprotected first-round draft picks -- 2022, 2024 and 2026 -- in the deal, plus pick swaps in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027, according to sources. The Rockets also get Cleveland's 2022 first-round pick, via the Milwaukee Bucks.  Wow"
"I'm not sure if this is complete, but from what I gather:  To Brooklyn:  * James Harden (obviously)  To Houston:  * Dante Exum * Victor Oladipo * Rodions Kurucs for some reason * Two 2022 firsts, a 2024 first and a 2026 first  To Cleveland:  * Jarrett Allen * Taurean Prince  To Indy:  * Caris LeVert"

I heard Victor Oladipo got traded as well
"And they got 4 guaranteed draft picks, 4 draft pick swaps, and Victor Oladipo out of it  Dictionary definition of a haul"
"In the season opener they actually put PJ on Dame Lillard for a couple of key poss at the end of the 4th and OT. Last poss [of that game he looks pretty good on here doing it](https://go.nba.com/hl3q).   Hou has asked him to play as a big the last 2 years but in 2019 googling his matchup tab here are the guys he spent the most time guarding: Paul George, LeBron, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard. If you go down youll see him having games of guarding 2's like Victor Oladipo, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine etc for 8-10 poss a game they really had him do it 2-5.  His best matchups are probably 3s and 4s. Every one of those wings I mentioned above I would trust to put on him unless he were to suddenly start showing his age over night."
"&gt; So really only Toronto and the Wizards are the two that will be noticeably worse than the Pacers.  I mean...it's possible but I'm not really sure how you can just declare this  -The Bucks are probably going to be better than the Pacers, sure  - I honestly think the Nets are the best of the rest and with KD looking stellar in his return, I think it's very likely they are a top 2 seed once the pieces really have time to gel  But beyond that???  -Sixers are the team I think are next in line, honestly.  I would put them over the Pacers at the moment but at the same time, the Pacers were a better team last year in terms of standings and now they have gained more back in health than the Sixers, iirc, and are clearly an improved team from last season when they placed ahead of Philly.  Philly is improved too and like I said, I think the Sixers would be my pick for third, but you certainly can't make a confident statement on why either team will place higher at this point  -Celtics are pretty good and could easily be a top 3 or even top 2 seed but like...the Pacers almost beat them 2 out of 2 times head to head this season (yes you could say the Celtics almost won both games as well but still).  Kemba will be out a while and this team is less balanced than the Pacers otherwise.  Once again, another team i miiiight put over the Pacers but I think they are squarely on the same tier as the Pacers and the Sixers and maybe the Nets.  As for the rest?  -Let's not forget that the Pacers finished ahead of a pretty healthy Heat team last season.  And what happened since then?  The Pacers got a new coach that dramatically overhauled the team's style of play, Victor Oladipo came back and looks like a borderline all-star for the first time since early 2018, Jeremy Lamb is due back, and the Heat...stayed pretty much the same?  The Heat had a great run in the bubble but I think the bubble favors a great shooting team like them.  I'm more inclined to look at the regular season where the Pacers  finished ahead of the Heat with no good verison of Oladipo and very little Lamb (albeit with more TJ Warren but still, he won't be out that long and it's a net positive in terms of injuries) and coach who appears to have the team playing better than last season.  At the very, very least, I don't see why the Heat are definitely above the Pacers at all.  -I get you have to be a loyal supporter of your Hawks and probably watch their games and know what they're capable of but...yeah I see no currently discernible reason why we should expect any reasonable likelihood of them finishing above the Pacers barring injury.  Especially when their losses thuss far includes the likes of the Hornets, Cavaliers, and the Knicks, 2 of whom the Pacers already beat handily.  Sneaky team but really no reason to expect them to JUMP an improved Pacers team"
"Victor Oladipo yelled, “There you go!” Myles Turner gave a look of pleasant surprise. Domantas Sabonis belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Malcolm Brogdon hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different despite appearing the same.”"
"Steven Adams, Victor Oladipo, Andre Roberson, and Jerami Grant is not a ""very bad team"" if you add ANY all star player"

"Nope, we're not gonna be doing this revisionism.  ESPN's 2020-2021 preseason player rankings had Draymond Green at 44th and no other non-Curry Warrior in the top 100.  ESPN's 2016-2017 preseason player rankings had Steven Adams at 36th, Victor Oladipo at 48th, and Enes Kanter at 80th."
people always say it was a sh*t draft but i would’ve drafted Victor Oladipo (traded down if necessary) and gotten rid of Dion fairly quickly to accommodate. that’s just me tho

Victor Oladipo
Victor Oladipo
"the 2020 1-7 seeds in the west are a lot better than cavs and heat era eastern conference teams    lebron can carry this team against rookie tatum, 4th quarter derozan, and victor oladipo. hes gonna have a much harder time against kawhi, jokic, dame, harden"
"Bro Russ had Victor Oladipo, Damontis Sabonis, and Steven Adams in 2017, what are you talking about ?"
"1. He’s shooting 30% from 3. He is not efficient    2. The perception is Booker is Kobe lite, a 27,28 ppg scorer. He’s averaging 20 right now. Will likely be around 23 a game. That’s not a DIP that’s enough of a difference to place him comfortably outside the top 15. He’s a quality SG and good scorer . He’s NOT some elite unstoppable top 15 guy like people think. He’s closer to victor Oladipo than Kobe Bryant."
