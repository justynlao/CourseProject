Kelly Olynyk is the answer
Ersan Ilyasova  Aaron Affalo  Kelly Olynyk
"Idk about u guys but I think losing Crowder hit the Heat really hard. He plays hard defense, can be streaky from 3 but overall very good in Heat system, and also they don't have Kelly Olynyk to start lol"
uhh we have no perimeter defense either. Every hornets fan could have told you some random guy was gonna rain threes on us. And kelly olynyk and max strus did that
At first glance I read Kelly Olynyk lol
"It’s Anthony Edwards not Kelly Olynyk. Edwards is far too fast in the open court to be chased down by pretty much anyone except LeBron. Also Giannis. I’m not saying he’s as good, the dude is just a train of elite athleticism and strength."
Kelly olynyk  Daniel Theis  Richaun Holmes  Hissan Whiteside  Khem Birch  Bismack Biyombo  These are the best guys available that can get signed under the MLE  I could see a world where they trade for Mason plumlee maybe?
So many players get worse the second they leave spo. And so many players get exponentially better once there with spo. It really is pretty wild. I think it has to do with the confidence he gives all his players. Cause I swear Kelly Olynyk thinks he’s curry.
If he's not good please trade him back to Miami in exchange for Kelly Olynyk.
I also like Kelly “The Clinic” Olynyk
Dion Waiters and Kelly Olynyk. Just cause Riley managed to finagle his way out of all those disaster contracts doesn't mean he's immune to making bad decisions too. Someone also mentioned Whiteside. There's a reason tge Heat 2021 pick was coveted.
"Let me introduce you to the absolute GOAT, Kelly Olynyk, He can practically be the second coming of Alonzo Mourning for Charlotte."
"Idk, I think threads like this are great but this subs active userbase is what makes them bad. This thread is great on r/baseball. It gives you insight into the histories of teams and fanbases.  Like a good answer for a wiz fan would be Kelly Olynyk. There's history there, a good story."
Kelly Olynyk might be the worst player in the NBA so far this year.

Kelly Olynyk is 1-8 from 3
Kelly Olynyk threes make me feel uncomfortable. There's gotta be a better shot
"Na Alex Caruso is the only great player in the league, maybe only Kelly Olynyk on a good day is better"
"Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Brandon Clarke"
What about Kelly Olynyk?
"No, he's right. You clearly have an issue with reading comprehension, or are simply disingenuous.   Kelly Olynyk made a tone deaf statement. OP laid out why it is tone deaf considering people can't afford to live. He then laid out the contrast of how Kelly ""only being able to be in his hotel and the arena"" is no different than the restrictions we've all been dealing with for a year. The first paragraph has to do with Kelly's money. The second doesn't."
You act like the celtics weren't the dirtier team. Kelly olynyk ripping out love's shoulder while about to be swept???
Our entire fan base revolves around saying fuck kelly olynyk every couple minutes
"All-Canada Team is nasty.  * **PG**: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, Cory Joseph * **SG**: Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker * **SF**: Andrew Wiggins, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles * **PF**: Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Khem Birch * **C**: Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell"
She told me she was gonna do a Kelly Olynyk is that good?
this is like when embiid dropped 45 on the heat — r/nba was chanting MVPiid but his primary defenders were stretch big kelly olynyk and g league mainstay chris silva.
"All I am saying is remember the Finals? On the off chance that Iron Man Bam gets injured our back up bigs are Olynyk and Leonard. You get rid of Leonard and we end up have to play Kelly like 35 min a night. That's not a recipe for the defensive identity that Miami hangs its hat on. We got Goran, Robinson, Herro, Butler, Nunn all in the guard/forward rotation where Oladipo would be.  I'm super high on Oladipo. I went to Purdue I watched him torch us. Followed him on the Pacers. He's amazing but i'm not absolutely certain our roster  construction at the moment desparately needs him. He would be an amazing get if we could get him without giving up too much but idk if that's possible."
I think the heat have lost a lot without Jae crowder Kelly Olynyk is their pf now.
Oubre / Olynyk  whick Kelly spends more time on their hair?
"Canada has three streaks of 3peats:  * Bill Wennington '96-'98 (2nd Bulls 3peat) * Rick Fox '00-'02 (Lakers 3peat) * Joel Anthony '12-'13 (Heatles) + Cory Joseph '14 (Spurs)  With the number of quality Canadian NBA players increasing, it seems likely that there will eventually be a longer streak: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are legit stars, RJ Barrett still might become a good player if he escapes NY before he gets too much Knicks stank on him, Andrew Wiggins is finally showing some signs of life on defense with Draymond kicking his butt in Golden State, and there are a ton of solid role players that could easily find a roster spot on a championship team: Chris Boucher (2 chips already), Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cory Joseph (1), Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson (1), Trey Lyles, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell. Marcus Carr is coming, too, and there are a number of other current NCAA prospects."
Kelly Olynyk. Sigh...
Kelly olynyk
1) Kelly Olynyk
"More that Gordos a fairly quiet gamer nerd from Indiana and LaMelos a teen reality star, who’s very much apart of the Instagram/youtuber culture, you probably get the same level of awkwardness in convos between Tyler Herro and Kelly Olynyk or between Kuzma and Jared Dudley, LaMelos rich kid/reality star upbringing probably shaped his personality more then his race"
Ask wizards fans from 2017 about Kelly olynyk
depends on the defense. I remember when kelly olynyk lit us up which led to boban getting benched. When the big man cant guard perimeter it gets real easy for good shooting big men to knock em down.
Excuse me.   Kelly Olynyk   That is all

You thinking Kelly olynyk or did Oubre do something I’m unaware of?
Kelly olynyk
Kelly Olynyk. Somebody's gotta shave this dude's entire head and face
Kelly olynyk is so fucking ugly I hate looking at his misshapen face
"This question also could be phrased as which fanbase of a player do you find the most annoying? Personally outside of an annoying fanbase,I think you shouldn't have a reason to hate a NBA player just as a basketball player that isn't a rival except Kelly Olynyk.   #FUCK KELLY OLYNYK"
Tristan doing his best Kelly Olynyk impression
Why the fuck is Kelly Olynyk even on a team
"I was thinking the same thing, but on the other hand, they just gave kelly olynyk a wide open layup"
Tobias Harris scores 50 tonight but Kelly Olynyk scores 60
It means Kelly Olynyk or Myers Leonard
If you don’t think Miami could win a title with that roster then you are just wasting your time with the current roster because the current roster is nowhere near the title threat that roster would be   The depth concerns are foolish Bam/Butler/Harden/Dragic/Avery bradley/Harkless/Iguodala and someone you can get from the buyout market which would be possible for Miami if they did this trade is plenty when your big 3 is bam Butler and harden. Again this is a 2 for 1 swap basically guys like kelly olynyk and Kendrick Nunn don’t move the needle at all vs the top competition. It’s not actually hurting playoff depth a whole lot and all the “spacing” concerns don’t matter nearly as much when you have generational talent like James harden that’s why you acquire generational talent in the first place. He himself demands double and even triple teams
all those ecf finals eating up on kelly olynyk and amir johnson were so impressive... it's a shame all it got him was a disgusting 12-26 finals record in games against the spurs and warriors
[I watched him run full sprint at Kelly Olynyk then stop at the free throw line waiting for somebody to take the ball away from him. ](https://twitter.com/dmay706/status/1349167011033702403?s=21)
"&gt;he’s going against a rookie and a second year guy  And Kelly Olynyk, one of my favorite Embiid punching bags"
"Idk man. It's just not. Why mention per 36? We're literally talking about one game. 5 points and 2 steals. In 32 minutes. Right up there with defensive stalwarts gabe Vincent, Kelly olynyk and Danny green"
Dude....Kelly Olynyk was the Heats best big tonight. Can we relax just a little bit?
Embiid is the best center in the league but is nobody going to mention the literal only two bigs he went against were Kelly Olynyk and a 6 8 rookie?? context kind of matters
Kelly Olynyk hates this man.
kelly fucking olynyk why
Kelly Olynyk is apparently more physically imposing than both Embiid and Simmons?  Phrases I never thought i'd say.
I read that as Kelly Olynyk at first and was gonna say Sam Cassell is better looking than him
"The Miami Heat have added these players to the OUT/Health and Safety Protocols list, following the completion of contact tracing:  Jimmy Butler  Goran Dragic  Kendrick Nunn  Bam Adebayo  Moe Harkless  Udonis Haslem  KZ Okpala  This is in addition to Avery Bradley, on the list Sunday.  ADDITIONALLY: Meyers Leonard (shoulder) is questionable, Kelly Olynyk (groin) is probable and Gabe Vincent (knee) is probable."
Kelly Olynyk is maple dick
Kelly Olynyk deserves that nickname more than Wiggins
"this happens like every month to us i swear. this is why we lose in the playoffs when people like fvv, powell(!!!), herro or robinson go off. fuck even kelly olynyk was killing us"
kelly olynyk was a fucking eldrich old god in summer league / preseason
Lemme have...uhhh...1 Tyler Herro with a side of Kelly Olynyk
Guys seem out of it except Kelly Olynyk for some reason
Kelly Olynyk looks like he sold weed to Duncan Robinson in high school
"In this day and age, I think we must consider: is Kelly Olynyk starting in the NBA an act of white supremacy?   ^^/s"
How could you disrespect Kelly Olynyk like that?
"I hate to say this as a Raptor lifer but I actually think Bargnani would've been much better in this era.  Now im not saying he would be ""good"" but I can see him as a stretch big that can score in bunches/ also the man could block some shots.  Maybe like a more agile Kelly Olynyk witha better shot?"
"&gt; a Kelly Olynyk situation if you know what I mean   I for one, have no idea what you mean."
"Maybe an overstatement, but a Kelly Olynyk situation if you know what I mean, difference being Kelly O is kinda consistent"
“Heat start Olynyk”  Woah woah woah...no Kelly Olynyk slander today after he Maple Dicked the Thunder last night
"Ah yes the annual ""why the fuck is Kelly Olynyk torching my team"" game, congratulations to OKC"
"100%. Have him mostly doing big man shit until the defence breaks down and loses shape, that’s when you get it to him to drive to the rim. Or if there’s a poor defender on the court he can target - even in an otherwise shitty series against the Heat we did this extremely successfully with Kelly Olynyk, Giannis targeted the shit out of him and couldn’t be stopped.  Of course, running that kind of system instead of just handing him the ball and getting to work requires set plays, screens and off ball movement which hasn’t been a strength of ours, but that’s what the regular season is for."
"Don’t hate on my man DWade. It rolls off the tongue.   The 2000s had a few notable stars with those kind of nicknames. AI (Allen iverson), TMac (Tracy McGrady), a lot of people referenced Vince Carter as just Vince, and last but not least, how could one almost forget KO (Kelly “Buckets” Olynyk)"
How would you like Kelly Olynyk for KAT
"Right, he just needs to go through his power-up arc is all. Perhaps he'll unlock 35% of CFA (Cuteness For All) after his next battle with Kelly Olynyk."
It felt like Kelly olynyk was your best shooter lol
"Kelly Olynyk has the most awkward running gait I have ever seen, every time he drives for a layup I cringe thinking he's going to lose control"
Did you shake hands like normal humans or like Kelly olynyk? Kevin love would like to know
"And yet the Lakers still dropped two to a team whose best defensive player was an undersized Bam Adebayo playing through an injury. Meanwhile, the hypothetical 2020 Raptors would have had 2 DPOYs, Siakam who's always elite on defense even when his shot doesn't go, plus a top 5 3&amp;D player in a healthy OG Anunoby, and that's just on the defense. If you still think that's comparable to a team that had to play Kelly Olynyk for 30+ minutes I don't know what to tell you."
"This is a gross oversimplification of Bam's defense lol. Dude guards all 5 positions every night, switching every pick and roll, covering for defensive mistakes made by putrid defenders like Olynyk, Duncan, Herro, Dragic, etc. He regularly bottles up perimeter stars into passing away from that matchup. Numbers don't equate for this shit lol.   Bam is a top 5 defender in the NBA. Miami has a top 5-6 defense with 3 positive defenders on it and 10 horrendous ones on it. Like, worst in the league bad. Orlando has a below average defense. 18th in drtg and 22nd in field goal % against. There is a grand canyon gap between Bam's defense and Vucevic's. The gap between them defensively is probably 5x the difference between them offensively.   Bam is close to Gobert defensively, if not certainly more useful come playoff time. Utah somehow has a worse defensive field goal % against than we do despite the fact that Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Goran Dragic, Kelly Olynyk, Gabe Vincent, Max Strus are arguably bottom 20 defensive players of anyone getting minutes in the NBA."
"*The Miami Heat are interested in acquiring 5x All Star and Pacers legend Reggie Miller. Willing to offer Kelly Olynyk, Kendrick Nunn and a 2026 2nd round pick.*"
Kelly Olynyk and throw myself into a volcano
only kelly olynyk
Tony Snell   Khris Middleton  Bismack Biyombo   Kelly Olynyk
"Please sign with the nets I really don't want him down here in with the Miami Heat, I don't understand why the Heat or not trying to get Drummond we need a big down here a real big not a Kelly olynyk big. The Heat also need to stay away from these guys that are towards the end of their career and or have been seriously hurt."
Can’t believe I’m saying this but I’m not sure Miami takes him over Kelly Olynyk.
Kelly Olynyk with Kevin McHales wingspan

Kelly Olynyk and it isn’t close
I also hate Kelly Olynyk for costing us the 2015 championship

Kelly Olynyk and Meyers Leonard
i cannot tell you how tired i am of starting kelly olynyk
Can they work together?  u/nyknicks get:  Kelly Olynyk  Precious Achiuwa  2022 - RD 2from Heat  2027 - RD 2from Heat  2027 - RD 1from Heat  u/MiamiHEAT get:  Julius Randle  Bradley Beal  u/WashWizards get:  Andre Iguodala  Meyers Leonard  2022 - RD 1from Heat  2024 - RD 1from Heat  https://tradenba.com/trades/sCFOb0H-3
u/MiamiHEAT get:  Victor Oladipo  Rodions Kurucs  u/HoustonRockets get:  Kelly Olynyk  Meyers Leonard  Picks
"If Love and Kyrie don't get injured in 2015, and they win the finals, does Blatt still get canned?  Fuck Kelly Olynyk"
"Multiple key players missing multiple games? Playing G-League players and rookies heavy minutes? Giving Kelly Olynyk a ton of minutes and a big green light? Nah, flukes."
"Regarding Leonard, there's always _some_ factor even if his stats don't reflect it.  In the final minutes of the 4th quarter tonight Kelly O fouled out. He and Bam are our only two bigs due to Meyers being gone. With Olynyk out Bam has to move to the 5, and he's much better utilized offensively and defensively at the 4.  Not having Leonard to bring in for Olynyk basically removed Bam from the game by having him do nothing but wrestle with Gobert.  Just having the size and weight to box out someone like Gobert is valuable in itself without a stat line to reflect it because it greatly improves the team's total rebounding ability."
Kelly Olynyk fouling out made it so much easier for the Heat to close out
Obligatory fuck Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk fouling out was the game changer. Thank you refs
Kelly Olynyk looks like he keeps a secret jar of farts stored in a safe at home
"1. the choice is bad 2. the worst part being if the choice was made because of ""winning"" while the Pacers with Sabonis on the court have been worse than the Hawks with Trae, or the Heat with Bam, is Sabonis rewarded because the Pacers are good when he's looking on the bench because his back up isn't Rajon Rondo or Kelly Olynyk 3. If you want to use the winning argument, Middleton is a better player on a better team"
The only reason I would trade Lowry would be to get that good Canadian fella Kelly Olynyk back on home soil

Refs are so inconsistent. An all star gets that call 10/10 but no whistle when it’s Kelly Olynyk
"I say three way deal....  Sacramento gets-Kyle Kuzma, KCP, Kelly Olynyk and second rounders   Lakers get-Buddy Hield, Goran Dragic &amp; Hassan Whiteside   Miami gets-Harrison Barnes, Marc Gasol &amp; Talen Horton Tucker     Sacramento gets Kyle Kuzma and sheds Barnes salary. KCP and Okynyk give them veteran bench pieces.   Lakers improve their backcourt and get a good rim protector.   Heat gets Barnes as a stretch 4, Gasol becomes a sold backup to Bam and Tucker becomes a young piece and can learn from Iggy."
Take Kelly Olynyk
"As a Celtics fan, a poor mans Kelly Olynyk could help the team this year"
He's just a stretch 5 with decent passing skills and bad defense at this point of his career. Basically a poor man's Kelly olynyk.
Please someone take Kelly Olynyk off our hands  Anyone..for anything...please
"Yeah I see the baggage as mainly the Kemba contract, the cap situation (though in fairness some of that is allocated to the guys who are the other team's future), and the lack of assets to create flexibility.  As for draft capital, to me it's a matter of having made too many selections and seeing too many of those selections ultimately return 0 value. Like let's go all the way back to 2013 and the draft day when the Brooklyn trade happened.  In 2013, the C's pick Kelly Olynyk. He walks away for nothing in 2017.  In 2014, they pick Marcus Smart (indisputably a big fat W), but they also pick James Young, who flames out of the league almost immediately.  In 2015, they grab Rozier. Turns out he's a great pick, but ultimately he's dumped to get Kemba Walker, who has produced mixed results so far and will likely either leave in free agency or cost picks to move. He's followed up by RJ Hunter (out of the league), Jordan Mickey (out of the league), and Marcus Thornton (out of the league).  In 2016, the Brooklyn trade pays off in a big way and they take Jaylen Brown. Unfortunately, they hang onto the #16 and #23 pick# too long and they becomes cap casualties in the form of Yabu and Zizic as necessary draft-and-stashes who never develop into an NBA players. He does manage to turn two seconds into a Memphis 1st (from the Clippers). But that becomes the Thybulle selection in 2019 and turned into #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). Jerome returned the #30 pick in 2020, which has since been turned back into two seconds. Edwards got a guaranteed deal for no real reason and likely will be out of the league soon.  The C's then still take 3 second round picks in this draft, two of whom drop out of the league (Demetrius Jackson, Ben Bentil). The other was Abdel Nader, who ultimately was dumped for Rodney Purvis, who was promptly waived.  2017 is another strong start with the Tatum selection. At 37, they also get Semi, who has over-performed for being drafted that late. But will he be here long-term? Or end up as another selection who walks away for nothing? Still not sure he belongs in a real contender's rotation. We also end up taking two more guys in the second round (Kadeem Allen and Jabari Bird) who do not play NBA basketball anymore.  In 2018, the last Brooklyn pick gets shipped out for Kyrie, who will leave for nothing. I don't blame Ainge for this one as I don't think many people understood what a headcase Kyrie actually was. They also get Robert Williams in this draft, which looks great so far.  I'm going to set aside the 2019 and 2020 drafts because they are too recent. But I will say the Edwards and Waters picks are really baffling and seemed destined to fail pretty early on. Why is the team so focused on getting undersized guards?  Anyway, the team has made so many draft selections, but aside from the three home runs and Kemba, they've turned into what 2 other guys that fans can feel confident may be rotation players (Robert and Pritchard)? We've got our fingers crossed that Langford and Nesmith will join them, but who knows. Maybe Semi and Grant can contribute, but they are so inconsistent still. That's why I feel those assets were mismanaged."
"When he hurt Westbrook, he still had some plausible deniability. Like Bruce Bowen the first time he stepped under someone's feet.   Now it's well known he's looking to injure people.  Compared to, say, Kelly Olynyk, who injured Kevin Love's shoulder, but hasn't had any incidents since. I couldn't stand Olynyk after that, but based on the 7 years since, there's reason to believe it wasn't intentional, or that at least he learned a lesson."
Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk is better
Kelly Olynyk
"If it weren't for the westbrook situation I don't think anyone would think that he needs to change anything, so iunno. He throws his body after loose balls in a scary way, to be sure, and that makes me cringe every time. --but I don't think he ever tries to hurt people.  I think kelly olynyk is just as deserving of the reputation really, after the k love play."
They should trade him to Miami for Kelly Olynyk if you ask me. Easy quick upgrade for the Nets and a scrub to help the Heat tank
"Please go look in the mirror and repeat ""Beverley tried to rip Jeff Green's shoulder out"" with a straight face. Dude got to the screen late and it was an offensive foul. What Kelly Olynyk did was try to rip Kevin Love's shoulder."
He got beat by Kelly Olynyk multiple times.. that's unacceptable
"It was a dynamic duo of Jimmy Butler and, Kelly Olynyk."
"What a scrub, they should trade him for Kelly Olynyk."
"So I’ve been reading Cousins is washed, super slow and a liability on the floor  But honestly anything is better than Kelly Olynyk"
Kelly Olynyk is pretty cute you want him??
"Except he has been playing well even when he can't shoot. Shooting is the only thing that exists in the game lol. He's almost averaging a triple double since coming back from covid. The Heat aren't great but that has more to do with the role players and injuries than Jimmy not performing. He makes the right reads and the right plays, he can't help it if Duncan Robinson and Kelly Olynyk can't hit open shots and can't defend for shit"
Yes this is like when the cavs absolutely rinsed the Celtics in the eastern semis after the Celtics eliminated us. Everyone knows the cavs were lucky they didn’t see us but what nobody talks about is how lucky the Warriors were that they didn’t have to play us.  Fuckin Kelly Olynyk
Kelly olynyk
"They call him Kelly ""The Clinic"" Olynyk for a reason lol"
Is it fair to say Kelly Olynyk low key one of the most annoying players to watch currently?
"Fuck Kelly Olynyk.  Guys lock up arms a lot more than they should, sure.  But locking an arm AND THEN USING YOUR WHOLE UPPER BODY TO YANK IT is completely fucking different.  Ugh.   I'm not saying he actually TRIED to hurt Kev, but it was 100% *at best* an awful, irresponsible, incredibly reckless play."
Why isn’t anyone talking about the beautiful defence from the warriors?  They switched everything without missing a beat. Kelly Olynyk felt that sky fucking energy.
Literally anytime I see that stupid douche nozzle I mutter “fuck Kelly Olynyk.”
Can any team save the Heat from Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk trying to show Myers and Lacob his value

I call that the Kelly Olynyk special
Kelly olynyk
Yeah it was a big asking price but come playoff time who gives a fuck about depth.  Imagine the Heat running out a lineup of Dragic/Harden/Butler/Iggy/Bam with some vet min depth off the bench alongside Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk...
Funny you say Kelly Olynyk because every time I turn on the tv I swear he’s hooping
"No Dragon, no Avery Bradley, somehow Kelly Olynyk is our starting 4 (he should never be a starter, off bench yes but starter no), and team learned how to deal with Robinson.  Team needs a 3 and D starting 4. And needs to wake up and learn how to hit 3's again because our 3 point shooting has gone way down hill."

Kelly Olynyk for Lowry. Dudes a Canadian super sayan.
"Irving Hayward in their primes who were aces of their previous teams. All star veteran Horford. Rising superstar Tatum. Rising star Brown. All-Defensive team Smart. Young yet elite coach.

"I’ve seen Kelly Olynyk of all people win a game 7 in the 2nd round. Not going to judge anyone based on one game. Getting to the line consistently is a skill. Which he lacks. Guys like that are really fun to watch when they’re on, but they’re pretty much useless when their shot doesn’t fall.  My point is that both him and Lillard score less efficiently in the playoffs, with a significant drop in Lillard’s case. I don’t see how that makes them better playoff performers in general."

You can’t convince me that Kelly olynyk doesn’t smell like Cheetos and BO
"This is revisionist history. No one thought Grant was worth $20M/yr at the time except the Pistons. Not the Nuggets, not any NBA analysts or any other team. The Nuggets offered it anyways. Throwing excess amounts of money to keep your own players is a strategy that has destroyed teams in the past. Look back at the Allen Crabbe, Tyler Johnson, Kelly Olynyk, etc. Not to take away from what Grant has shown, but for the role and impact he was playing for the Nuggets last year he wasn't worth more than $15M/yr annually.   He's certainly proved hes worth $20M/year but a player breaking out to the level he did at age 27 isn't something to be expected. Still not convinced he's a 25 PPG scorer on an actual contender either. Anyways, the Nuggets signed Jamychael Green for 1/3rd of the price of what the Pistons pay Grant and is bringing similar production in a similar role to what Green was doing last year. If Green was still averaging 13 PPG on good but not great defense, a non factor as a rebounder, Grant would've easily been one of the worst contracts in league history if he was signed at $30M/year."
"Blockbuster Trade that will change the NBA and will make every team better. Teams involved are Bucks, Heat, Wizards, &amp; Celtics  Bucks receive: Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal  Wizards receive: Kris Middleton, Kelly Olynyk, Kendrick Nunn, Robert Williams, Donte Divincenzo, DJ Wilson, 4 bench players from the heat to make the cap work. &amp; a first round pick from the bucks.   Heat receive: Kemba Walker, Thomas Bryant, 2nd round pick from Bucks   Celtics receive: Jrue Holiday, Andre Igoudala, 2nd round pick from Bucks     What this trade does:  The East instantly becomes very competitive.   Miami Heat: They will get better by adding Kemba Walker for basically Kendrick Nunn and Olynyk. They’ll have Thomas Bryant under contract for next year and will only get better with a core of Kemba Herro Robinson Butler Adebayo Myers Leonard Dragic and Avery Bradley. Kemba will add a lot of fire power to their offense. He will fit right in with all of the shooters and ball movement the Heat play with. Instant championship contenders barring injuries.  Celtics: The Celtics are a great young team as of right now. The duo of Tatum and Brown looks better everyday. The problem is as of right now is that Kemba doesn’t fit well with them. He is also a liability on defense for them. This trade will get them Jrue Holiday and Iggy. They will get a lot better on defense and I think Jrue would fit right into their team. Iggy will be a nice piece off the bench. They do lose Robert Williams, but that is why they get a 2nd round pick in return.   Bucks: This should be a no brainer for them if they want to compete. At the end of the day it is a long season and they can definitely turn it around in the playoffs. But they can also have Russ, Beal, Giannis as their core. They have a great bench and solid role players. This trade will make them a championship threat rather than a hopeful run. By the looks of it, they will lose in playoffs the same way they’ve lost the last 2 years. Especially if they have to see the Nets. This trade possibly makes them the best team in the East. Bradley Beal is a heck of a player that got want to have. If Giannis can get a player that can score at will and on top of it get the energy Russ brings, they will be extremely hard to stop.   Wizards: The Wizards are in rebuild mode. The Wizards will lose Westbrook and Bradley Beal. They will be getting in return a whole lot of prospects and players they can offer for trade. Kris Middleton is in his prime and has multiple years under his contract. It might be hard to move him right now but in the future there will be some value for him. They will be getting Kendrick Nunn and Robert Williams. Both players could be future all stars. Dante Divincenzo who is a solid role player. Kelly Olynyk who they can always use for trade bait. They will also get a bunch of other young guys and a first round pick from the Bucks to top it all off.   In the end, all of these teams get better. The east will have multiple contenders consisting of the Nets, Bucks, Heat, Celtics, and 76ers. You won’t be able to tell who will win the east if this trade happens. As of right now the Nets will probably win the east.. This trade definitely makes it unpredictable as to who will win the east.    Who says no to this trade? Let me know your feedback."
"&gt; Yet each draft, that’s exactly what he did. He refused to “make a bad trade” so instead he wasted picks on guys like Fab Melo, Yabu, RJ Hunter, James Young, etc.  These aren't even the worst draft choices either.  The most unforgivable pick Danny Ainge ever made was Kelly Olynyk. A fine player, but when you're just starting your rebuild you don't take a 22 year old rookie. Especially when Giannis (who was first linked to the Celtics if I recall correctly) is on the board.  First year of the rebuild is when you swing for the fences.  Of course Giannis doesn't become what he is today under Brad Stevens, but that is another convo..  And before anyone says that it's easy to say pick Giannis now, back in 2013 I said he should be considered after Oladipo and Mclemore"
Kelly Olynyk and Gabe Vincent is the best i can do for Harden  Who says no?

CELTICS   Tacko Fall  (Memes)  Kelly Olynyk (for the legendary game 7 against the Wiz)  Rondo  (the last active piece of the 2008 era)
"&gt;Yawn. It’s 2021, can’t use anything but TS% anymore  According to [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) there were only 6 qualified players in the NBA last year with a worse TS% than Wall.  &gt;I mean, if you wanna talk about why his assists were down last year, maybe start with the trash teammates he had who couldn’t hit shots.  Here's a list of players on the rockets last year who played significant minutes (500+) and had a better TS% than John Wall: Kelly Olynyk, Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr., Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks, David Nwaba, KPJ, Danuel House, Boogie Cousins, and Victor Oladipo. The only two who were less efficient than him in that many minutes were noted offensive sparkplugs PJ Tucker and Ben McLemore. Talk all you want about how his assist numbers would be better if he didn't have ""trash teammates who couldn't hit shots"", but I find that really hard to take when almost everyone on the team is out shooting him.  Would his efficiency be better if he didn't have to carry so much offensive load on a shitty team? Yeah, probably. Would it be *significantly* better? I don't see why it would be. John walls main role on a team will always been as an offensive engine. He's not a dynamic off ball player, especially not at this point in his career.  If he were to get 6th man minutes on a good team, he could probably put up more efficient numbers on 50-60% of his current volume, but the fact of the matter is that no contending team is going to give 6th man minutes to a relatively inefficient scorer who can't defend effectively anymore, even if he was on a much cheaper deal."
Kinda true but not saying much either. They do have Kelly Olynyk who is still a good scorer. They are trash team tho
"I got a list  1. CP3 2. Embiid 3. Harden 4. John Collins  5. Kelly Olynyk  6. Blake Griffin 7. Bam  8. Herro  9. Dragic 10. Booker 11. Crowder 12. AD 13. Bradley Beal   Fully prepared to get downvoted by fans of these guys, just can’t stand watching them sometimes."

Yes. Fuck Kelly Olynyk.
Here's the list from 2019-2020. A lot of the same guys show up on both.   Ante Žižić  Cody Zeller   Moritz Wagner  Nikola Vučević  Noah Vonleh     Omari Spellman    Dwight Powell        Kelly Olynyk         Nicolò Melli       Kevon Looney      Frank Kaminsky    Nikola Jokić      Willy Hernangómez  Dewan Hernandez       Harry Giles     Cristiano Felício      Andre Drummond    Ed Davis            Marques Bolden  Jonah Bolden         Ryan Anderson
Here's the list from last season.  DeMarcus Cousins  Andre Drummond  Gorgui Dieng  Andre Drummond  DeMarcus Cousins  Gorgui Dieng  Cristiano Felício    Gorgui Dieng  Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins  Dewayne Dedmon   Nikola Jokić  Kelly Olynyk  Bam Adebayo   Steven Adams  Khem Birch    Kelly Olynyk                                   Jeff Green            Bruno Fernando  Jahlil Okafor
"Im a big Gonzaga fan so I am a fan of the  grizzlies and wizards.  Also Canadian so I'll always tune in to see guy like Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray and Rj Barrett when I get the chance."
Kelly Olynyk should thank John Collins for allowing him to exist on the same spectral plane.
"Wait, do we hate Kelly Olynyk now? I guess I can get on board with it... fuck that guy!"
"The Amishness of Kelly Olynyk, that goatee got him looking like a Pennsylvanian Shaggy. Pls grow some side-burns or a stache, I’d even take mutton chops! Pls Kelly"
"I hope Kelly Olynyk suffers a season ending, non-serious injury. Something like, a botched nose job"
"I hate Kelly olynyk. I hate looking at him, I hate his dumb face, I hate his pubes patch beard."
Any team that has al horford or Kelly olynyk. That series against the hawks with walls broken hand and pierce not being able to get that corner three off in time. Killed me to see horford get that rebound for the last second bucket. And olynyk because he fucking torched us for 30+
Little bit of both. Can’t really fix the issue with a paint dominant big like embiid and you absolutely shouldn’t because embiid is much better than Simmons. Although instead of some of these guys they brought in they could’ve tried hard for a guy like kelly olynyk as a backup big to play with Ben and amplify his positives. But it seemed like they just didn’t take that into account and kept drafting and recruiting for defense first
"Yis I'm going for the Pistons slot.   We are finally in full rebuild mode! These are a brand new Pistons. Off the car lot new. Our longest tenured player on our roster is 2020 7th overall pick starting PG Killian Hayes. On opening night vs Chicago he attempted to be tank commander with 0 pts/5 rebs/2 ast/2 TO on 0/6 shooting in 20 mins. G leaguers normally don't start in the NBA. YEESH! New players of note: 1st overall draft pick 'Motor' Cade Cunningham and 2nd round C (NCAA POTY) Luka Garza along with FA signees Kelly Olynyk (can he sustain success from his time in Houston?) and former lottery pick backup F/C Trey Lyles ([Can he get over his distaste for Detroit?](https://www.deseret.com/2018/4/3/20627163/former-utah-jazz-player-trey-lyles-rips-on-utah-quin-snyder-s-practices)). Our 2nd year tank should be aided by Cade injuring his ankle in preseason - which will keep him out likely until after the team's first road trip of the season (at a minimum). Returning players of note include (Ben Wallace mentored) 6'9"" C Isaiah 'Beef Stew' Stewart and sharp shooting SF Saddiq Bey - both alternates for the U.S. Olympic team - as well as Olympian (and 2nd in Most Improved Player voting) F Jeremy Grant. We will be exciting at times, but mostly sucktastic, until we get more players to space the floor."
I hope not.  I never want to see a team with Kelly Olynyk on it win
I went 2/5 got Kelly Olynyk cuz of 2k I yell at him every mycareer game and my boy TCraig
I got 2 out of 5 lol. Kelly Olynyk and Mason Plumlee
"Bjelica plays exactly like 2016-2019 Kelly Olynyk. Fake handoffs, putting it on the floor, pick and pop.  Jesus christ his skill set is perfect for this team."
"Magic I’m taking a flyer on because I like their new coach and Jonathan Isaac a lot. Pistons Added an underrated Kelly olynyk to an already promising young front court and I think Cade goes a long way to sure up their ball handling/pg duties. Toranto, I think, move on from dragic relatively soon or at least give Flynn plenty of minutes to develop this year. I’m high on Scottie, but I don’t think that he solves their late game go-to guy issues."
"To pay Kelly olynyk $12 million? I'm probably the world's biggest Olynyk fan, but he isn't that much better than Mason."
There's almost no year to year predictability to that. Kelly Olynyk was 7th or so last year. Brown and Tatum were #1/2 last year and ... not this year.
Kelly Olynyk has played plenty smh
May I introduce you to Kelly olynyk
"Some $10-13m players: Marcus Smart, Jusuf Nurkic, Kelly Oubre, Kelly Olynyk.  Or to look at it more broadly:   Average 4th highest paid player on a team: $15.46m  Average 5th highest paid player on a team: $10.89m  So if you think Wiggins should be the 4th-5th highest paid player on a team, a good contract should be like $10-15m"
"Yeah Kelly olynyk still has a job because he’s a stretch big &amp; that’s his reputation, this isn’t surprising at all."
[Guess which center in the 2013 draft class has more than both of them combined.](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/giannis-or-ad-or-kelly-olynyk-career-3-pointers)
"Yeah, why sign Wendell when we could sign Kelly Olynyk &amp; Mason Plumlee back to back offseasons for the same price and dump a Bruce Brown type for literally nothing?"
"If you're talking about the 2015 finals, K Love didn't play the basically the whole playoffs cuz of Kelly Olynyk, LeBron's best teammates were Timofey Mosgov and Iman Shumpert during the Finals, AI still had DPOY Dikembe Mutombo in his team in 2001 tho."
"* PG: Seth Curry, Jordan Clarkson * SG: Buddy Hield, Terry Rozier * SF: Malik Beasley, Duncan Robinson * PF: Davis Bertans, Joe Harris * C: Karl Anthony-Towns, Kelly Olynyk  77% chance at playoffs (projected record of 47-35), 2% chance at a title"
Kelly olynyk was murdering people all season have some respect
"&gt;He was doing this post all star break last season too  He most definitely was not lmfao.  14.4 ppg on 43/35/87 splits post allstar break (ok, but Kelly Olynyk was better)  vs  23.3 ppg on 52/40/85 splits 4 games in the pre-season so far."
Kelly Olynyk is a nice passer/ball handler for a role player
"Does he? Their marquee FA signing was Kelly Olynyk, right?"
"It was huge, but at the time the Wizards were looking good with Wall, Beal and Otto Porter. If game 7 Kelly Olynyk didn’t turn into game 6 Klay Thompson, the Wizards go to the conference finals. Wall and Porter got injured and it all fell apart for Washington."
I know Kelly Olynyk and Brandon Clarke both had huge growth spurts either right at or directly after turning 18. They both needed a redshirt year at Gonzaga to figure out how to play in their new bodies
I have another. I have no motive. But Kelly Olynyk definitely wanted to pull Kevin Love’s shoulder out.
"Too early but I’m liking our bench of   Cory Joseph  Josh jackson Hamidou Diallo Trey Lyles Kelly Olynyk  3 of these guys shoot the three at a solid % while Cojo is good at running the unit along with both Josh and Hami being good cutters and defenders. Not to mention Cojo, Lyles and KO got good synergy being they played for the Canadian National team."
"For being the tallest group, this team is well rounded. The amount of passing and shooting on 6'11"" is surprisingly quite good. Ben Simmons and Jokic can be 1a/1b for distribution, with Giannis being a secondary/tertiary ball handler. I would actually put Giannis at the 2 instead of KAT on defense.  The bench is impressive too. If things get a bit bad defensively, I think Ayton can step in and do good work for 3-5 (maybe even on 2s as well). Kelly Olynyk and Vucevic can space the floor, Turner can play defense and space a bit, and Sabonis can create offense as well."
They would have won in 2015 if Kelly Olynyk didn't rip Kevin Love's arm out of his socket and Kyrie's kneecap didn't implode. They probably would have won 2017 if KD didn't go to Golden State.
"2017 Eastern Conference Semi-Finals, Celtics vs. Wizards game 7.  The Kelly Olynyk game.  26/4/4 during the game with 14 points in the 4th quarter.  He didn't miss a 2 during his 28 minutes &amp; swung the game for the Celtics.  Sorry, Wizards fans."
and one’s Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk putting on a clinic
"Lol your analysis is shit tier, jesus christ. He's been a 2nd team caliber defender the last two years. He was the best defender on the best defense in the league last year with AD out. The Lakers were a top 2 seed with AD having a worse season than fucking Kelly Olynyk up until his injury. Either watch closer or learn about the game."

"idk, I'd put SGA, Wiggins, and jamal murray above him. Then you have Dort and RJ Barrett. Imo, he's fighting for 6th at best, with dudes like Dillon Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, and (if he makes a jump) NAW."
"It's a rather poor return that they got for Harden, to be honest.  Rockets got Oladipo, Exum, Brooklyn's 2022, 2024, and 2026 1sts, and Milwaukee's 2022 1st (from Cleveland).  There's pick swaps in there (2021, 2023, 2025, 2027) but those are unlikely to convey any time soon (the 2021 did not).  They traded Oladipo on to Miami for Avery Bradley (left in free agency), Kelly Olynyk (left in free agency) and a 2022 pick swap.  Here's what Houston still has from the Harden trade:  * Brooklyn 2022, 2024, &amp; 2026 1sts (2022 and 2024 are likely to be late round picks.  2026 is too far out to say)    * Milwaukee's 2022 1st (likely to be a late round pick)    * Pick swap with Miami in 2022- unlikely to convey    * Pick swaps with Brooklyn in 2023 (unlikely to convey), 2025 (possibly conveys), and 2027 (possibly conveys)    * Dante Exum  That's a lot of nothing for Harden  Vs the rumored package of Simmons, Thybulle, picks and potentially Maxey.  Even if you think that Simmons isn't worth building around, you turn and flip him like they tried to with Dipo."
Played just as hard? You must be delusional. Jimmy didnt have an MVP caliber player on his team. Two of our best players out with injuries as well as having 2 god damn rookies and Kelly Olynyk to close out the games. Yeah makes sense.
I remember Kelly Olynyk obliterating the Wizards in Game 7 of Round 2 playoffs
"Lmao how is this upvoted and a top comment. The question was ""what adjustments did the Bucks make"" not ""Heat apologists come carry water and make some excuse why Kelly Olynyk was the linchpin of the 2020 Heat"""
"Well, the Heat lost Kelly Olynyk, so you are looking at this from the wrong end."
"Christian Wood has started 53 games in 5 years in the league. He put up decent stats on the worst team in the league last year (much like Kelly Olynyk). If you're talking about him as a 3rd option on a playoff team, he's overrated."
This is Kelly Olynyk erasure
shoutout to kelly olynyk for pulling out kevin love's arm from its socket and zaza paculia for taking down kawhi too
Derek Fisher  JR Smith  Lakers Artest  Robert Horry  Kelly Olynyk
"But that doesn't work either. That sounds exactly like the Ben-Dwight pairing which got destroyed in the Hawks series.   Unless by role playing big you mean Kelly Olynyk, which would be its own issue. You can't just pair a rim runner runner Ben because Bens man is going to be under the rim the entire time anyway.   Like which non-elite Big fits the system you're describing that could also start for a playoff team?"
A lot of that would have depended on his performance  in Houston. If he goes over there  and still only scores from within 5 feet on a team like Houston that puts a bunch of 3s and has guys like Kelly olynyk averaging 20ppg and KPJ dropping a 50 bomb it’s gonna be a bad look .   And because of that  I could see his trade value dropping lower than where it was in January … obviously it’s not gonna get as low as it is now but still that’s why sixers should have done everything possible (include Maxey) to get the harden trade to go down .. easy to say in hindsight tho
"Celtics   2011 - Norris Cole (Jajuan Johnson)   2012 - Fab Melo, John Jenkins (Jared Sullinger, Fab Melo)   2013 - Shabazz Muhammed (Kelly Olynyk)   2014 - Julius Randle, Tyler Ennis (Marcus Smart, James Young)   2015 - Rashad Vaugh, Chris McCullough ( Terry Rozier, RJ Hunter)   This is a very bad team. Makes Ainge look really good if you look at who was drafted immediately after."
Everyone has these high standards for big man play now?! Ben can be a 4/5 in this league with his defense alone. Not like he’d be matching up against Embiid and Jokic every night.   There are smaller and worse 4s. There are also bigger players that play no D at all. Daniel Gafford just started at C in the playoffs last year. You’d take Kelly Olynyk or Daniel Gafford at big before Ben?
For some reason when I read Kelly Oubre I kept thinking of kelly Olynyk  and wondering why no one was questioning it.
center is a weakness for us right now. our projected starter is fucking kelly olynyk. barring injuries i don't see Garza playing much tho.
"&gt; I don't know how much truth there is to the statement ""Danny Ainge scouted him personally and believes he is a 6'10"" point guard"" but either way, comparisions to a point guard/forward were also common.  This hurts way more knowing that Danny then turned around and picked Kelly Olynyk at 13, right before Giannis went at 15."
"Boston drafting Kelly Olynyk is a really good example of a pick that can be both good and bad depending on how you look at it.  I remember seeing somewhere else it was essentially a coin-flip decision between Giannis and Kelly Olynyk.   * If you look at who we missed, Boston obviously fucked up.   * If you look at Kelly Olynyk as our pick in isolation, he wasn't a terrible pick.   He was a mediocre #13 pick and certainly not a bust, there just happened to be an incredible option right after.  In a similar sense, Korkmaz was a good pickup at #26 in the 2016 draft as long as you ignore Siakam being drafted #27."
"Imagine drafting Kelly Olynyk! At least he got us through game 7 against the wizards in 2017, I can never be mad at Kelly after that."
Prolly lose against the wizards in game 7 without the great Kelly Olynyk
"That is why as a Celtics fan I will always hate Olynyk. Such an obvious medium floor low ceiling guy. At that time in Boston the Celtics needed a home run swing and Giannis was exactly that player, but they went for the sac bunt in Kelly, which was successful, but the final score was 9-1 after a suicide squeeze."
"The undersized back court doesn’t help.  If Blazers could move CJ for a 3&amp;D small forward and move Powell back to SG, their defense would improve.   Kanter is another bad fit for a team looking for defense. Maybe upgrade Kanter with Daniel Theis or Kelly Olynyk and the Blazers would be more balanced.   I still think Portland has a window and assets to make 2-3 quality moves and balance their roster. But when Olshey says the roster is not an issue that has to be demoralizing."
Cries in Kelly Olynyk
Hehe yeah ik I’m a Mavs and I’m definitely not complaining I just forgot that the player we took over Giannis was Kelly Olynyk
Damn they really took Kelly Olynyk over Giannis
"Giannis was still on the board and we picked Kelly Olynyk.  On second thought, he'd probably been wasted in Brad's system. Glad he went to the Bucks then."
so Kelly Olynyk and a few 2nd round picks? Love 2k.
"I thought the same thing about the Harden deal, then they trade him for a few picks + assets they flipped for Oladipo, who they flipped for... Avery Bradley &amp; Kelly Olynyk.  Portland would be thrilled to receive a young star such as Ingram given that they have 0 leverage here."
"And most of the time with this specific issue we're not talking about multimillionaires. I mean, Kelly Olynyk is a multimillionaire. We're talking about the 9 digits *per contract* friggin obscene millionaires."
"&gt;Lopez is not a better scorer than Olynk, I don’t see how anyone is gonna argue this. There’s a fucking reason teams don’t have him shooting 12 hook shots a game.  Theres also a fucking reason it took almost a decade for Kelly Olynyk to take 12 shots a game, and that's because it leads to losing basketball. Literally 29 other teams wouldn't allow it, congrats he found the #1.  You're coming soooo close to my point and still not getting it. If Robin Lopez averaged 12 shots a game the team would suck ass. Yes. You've gotten that point. Guess what happened when a team let Kelly Olynyk average 12 shots/game? Worst ORtg in the league.  **Its the same concept** we just saw one where the situation actually occurred. And it led to a predictably terrible product.  No decent team is actually gonna give him a decent contract based on his scoring because its not actually scalable - its just based on opportunity.   &gt;What you said about Olynk never averaging 10 PPG is objectively wrong as well.   I said never averaging more, and you're right I missed that he once averaged 11.5. Wowee!!  Frank Kaminsky is a better scorer for Robin Lopez too, but good thing we dont just judge value based on scoring especially from a career backup C."

"All things considered I think you graded the Kelly Olynyk pick way too harshly. I know the Giannis factor, and he was picked earlier than you would like, but he is a very solid nba player"
Game 7 ECSF 2017. Seeing Kelly Olynyk turn into prime dirk will never not hurt
Bruh Jared Sullinger is a B while Kelly Olynyk is a D?? What??
"Yeah maybe it’s confusing I did just hop on the train. Never said Lowry wasn’t worth trading for it pursuing. I only said that he is being way overrated as an asset by the fans and clearly the FO given what they wanted from the 76ers before the deadline.   Looking through this thread though, raptors fans expect Simmons and picks or something crazy like that for facilitating a sign and trade of a 36 year old who by your own admission wasn’t even the #2 option on his team the one time they reached the heights which now lead to his inflated valuation.   Bringing up CP3 only highlights how badly the raptors FO is trying to rip off any suitors. The trade for him was essentially Kelly Olynyk and 1 FRP which will probably be like after #20 given the sun’s success. This is for the point god, a bonafide legend who is in the conversation with Stockton and Nash all time, who is certainly a top option for his teams."
"It's not grading Olynyk it's grading Ainge for taking a safe pick and not swinging for the fences. Kelly is a good player but taking a low ceiling high floor player immediately after commiting to a rebuild is dumb and Ainge should have taken the highest potential guy, not a rotation piece ceiling."
"Ontario (Canada): Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Trey Lyles, Mfiondu Kabengele, Cory Joseph, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, RJ Barrett, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Nickeil Alexander-Walker…. Damn!!! We got a squad!!!!"
Cause they were missing the goat Kelly Olynyk 😤
"A video ( I think?) Or an interview with a former NBA coach showed that something almost lightly logarithmic as far transitions go from practice % and game % which was consistent across the league, which I found fascinating (everyone exposed to same factors for practice vs in game). Like in practice a 70-85% FT shooter is 40-60 % in games, 85-90% FT shooter is a 60-80 in game, and 90+% in practice is the 80+ club (with intangibles for the 90 club like Nash, Chris Paul, curry, harden, etc).  Wonder if we'll ever have stats on 3 point shooting.probably not for our own benefit, since nephews seeing someone like bismack fucking biyombo shoot 60 percent from 3 in practice and lose their mind.  Personal experience - I watched Kelly olynyk in an open court warm up in Boston back in 2013 I think hit like 80-85 3s out of 100. First time I've ever seen a player practice like that; had me thinking he was the next Larry bird. And turns out... That was normal. ⚰️"
"I agree SAC/LA is in its own echelon, you're not going to get an argument from me there. However, you really need to rewatch what Dray got away with against OKC.

Kelly Olynyk would be a nice big man for the Raptors.
"The Rockets trading James Harden for washed Victor Oladipo, who they ended trading for fucking Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk, is definitely up there. It’s unbelievable that Harden was part of two of the worst trades in NBA history less than ten years apart."

Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
Lakers were just a terrible matchup for him. They honestly had more issue with Kelly Olynyk.
"nah that’s not how it works, you see guys on the Rockets like Kelly Olynyk, Kenyon Martin Jr, KPJ, Tate all but up very impressive scoring efficiency."
"Isaiah Thomas and Rondo for the Celtics. We also have love for guys like Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder and Kelly Olynyk."
It was the injuries. Kelly Olynyk almost disabled that dude.
"Clearly talking about Kelly Olynyk, come on man it’s common sense"
The kelly olynyk of small forwards
"Despite the roster's wealth of NBA experience, Canada is missing a number of notable talents.  In addition to injured Denver Nuggets shooting guard Jamal Murray, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Memphis Grizzlies guard Dillon Brooks, Boston Celtics big man [Tristan Thompson](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/6364), Houston Rockets big man [Kelly Olynyk](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/2041), and Toronto Raptors bigs [Chris Boucher](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/46591) and [Khem Birch](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/11121) are sitting out the qualifiers."
It actually hurts a lot. They should have kept in Kelly Olynyk. Could have used his enthusiasm today.
"Yeah. It’s too bad that our best big men were injured or opted out. Kelly Olynyk, TT and Khem Birch would’ve helped a lot. We wouldn’t have had to rely on Dwight Powell so much."
Not to mention Tristan Thompson and Kelly Olynyk. Really could have used their size down the middle when we went cold beyond the arc.
"We needed Jamal Murray, SGA, dillon brooks, chis boucher, kelly olynyk and khem birch."
"And, i can't believe im saying this, Kelly Olynyk"
Kelly Olynyk would've been great too but he's also a FA
Kelly Olynyk and Boucher too
Joins Kelly Olynyk as players suspended a game in following season for their actions in a playoff game  I know theres more but Im blanking rn
"That’s not true at all. Jokic sets up a whole lot of easy buckets. NBA players make simple shots. Kelly Olynyk averaged 4 assists per game on the rockets, and you think Jokic couldn’t average 3?"
"76ers could have given just as many draft picks with better young players like Thybulle and Simmons. They could have flipped Simmons and Thybulle for more picks too. All-defense players have value even if they don't want to shoot the ball.   Even if they thought that Nets had a better deal, you can get more from Jarett Allen than just a single FRP. They also opted not to take Caris LeVert, opting to get Oladipo in the trade instead while sending a 2nd rounder to Pacers. And what did they get back for Oladipo? Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk and a pick swap?   Just take a page from Sam Presti on how to get picks from teams."
"No, but it would cause huge ratings for the next game.  While arguably not an ""attack"" Kelly Olynyk essentially did this to Kevin Love in 2015."
Kelly Olynyk is the Bill Laimbeer of this generation
Kelly olynyk might be worse honestly
You misspelled Kelly Olynyk.
As a Mavs fan he's not leaving lol. Really hope we don't play another waiting game for a big fish free agent then end up with Kelly Olynyk or some shit as our prize from FA
Lol you should see how Cavs fans treat Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk?
"You’re blinded by a hate boner,Kelly olynyk done the exact same play and injured Kevin love"
Jeff Teague and Kelly Olynyk
"He declined for some reason. Probably rehabbing, and given all the injuries I don’t blame him.  Kelly Olynyk and Khem Birch too, but they’re both FAs so it’s a little more obvious why they did. Tristan Thompson just cuz I guess."
"yeah that's true about the PF position. they'd probably need to make a subsequent move to get a PF if they don't plan on just letting ben play full time PF. Thybulle can probably handle himself at PF as well, but doing any of that is going to take him away from the perimeter where he thrives.   i'd love to get kelly olynyk, but he probably played himself into a better contract than what the sixers can offer."
my line of thinking extends to throwing the full MLE (if we can manage to get it) at Kelly Olynyk so that way we can run a lineup with 4 out + Simmons
USA is quaking in their boots thinking about Kelly olynyk
"* 2020 - Jimmy, Bam, and Dragic get injured in the first half of the finals. * 2019 - Kevin Durant missed half the playoffs, tears his Achilles in the finals, and then Klay Thompson tears his ACL in the finals. * 2018 - Chris Paul gets injured in the Western Conference finals, swinging the series. * 2017 - Kawhi is blowing out the KD Warriors and then gets Zaza'd. * 2016 - Andrew Bogut breaks his leg in the finals and Draymond gets suspended for nut tapping LeBron. * 2015 - Kevin Love gets his arm snapped by Kelly Olynyk, Kyrie Irving's knee cap breaks in the first half of the finals, and the refs don't call a technical foul on David Blatt for calling a timeout with no timeouts left."
"And Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson."
"Jamal Murray - SGA - Corey Joseph   Dillion Brooks - Lugentz Dort     RJ Barrett - Andrew Wiggins   Kelly Olynyk - Chris Boucher   Tristan Thompson -  Dwight Powell - Khem Birch     Barely misses cut: NAW, Nembhard, Ejim, Mulder"
"As well as Kelly Olynyk, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Oshae Brisset, Dillon Brooks and a couple others. Fully healthy this team would be scary"
Yeah we’re not gonna agree on this. Look into the shit Kelly Olynyk has done. You’ll see the same comments you made about Bev on a thread from several years ago asking if he’s a dirty player. Same thing where he’s “clumsy” and just happens to make a dirty play almost every game.
if we (sixers) can get enough cap space to offer a full MLE i wouldn't mind going after him if we can't get Kelly Olynyk. if ben sticks around i think Kelly needs to be #1 target
&gt; 24 ppg on 51/42/80 shooting splits and 62.3 TS% is fringe elite scoring  Kelly Olynyk in 27 games with the Rockets:  19/8/4 on 67% TS.    Tanking teams always have some dude putting up crazy numbers.
"I'll only do a mix of perfect and realistic because I'm lazy.  * Draft Moody and one of Kispert/Duarte (If possible, package the picks to trade for Jalen Greens spot.) * Sign a Vet PG that can shoot decently and run a bench unit in the offseason * Sign Kelly Olynyk * Sign Chriss back * Move Looney permanently to the backup 4. * Move Nico and possibly Jessup into 2 ways for further development. * Klay returns at 85% or more of himself. * Wiseman takes a good leap into being somewhat close to an Ayton esque player in his 2nd season, with a better shot. He has a lot more muscle and strength, knows the Warriors offensive and defensive system better and continues to learn to use his build to defend on all levels. * Steph wins MVP. * Dray is back to being a clutch shooter. * SnT Oubre for assets, whether it be one of the new additions or picks or TPE, whatever it is. * Poole continues to take massive leaps in areas of his game. * Re-sign all the players that need to be re-signed in the roster below.   1. Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Wiseman 2. Vet PG/Poole/Moody/JTA/Olynyk 3. Lee/2nd Rookie/Bazemore/Looney/Chriss"
&gt;spurs- sign kelly to a 3 year 60 million deal  Is there a Kelly besides Olynyk and Oubre...? Who is Kelly?
Don’t forget about greasy Kelly Olynyk!
Obama on Kelly Olynyk
Your team turned Harden and Westbrook into John Wall and Kelly Olynyk so idk why u think u can say anything about the knicks. Huerter had 27 in game 7 when Trae was brick chucking
I know Durant won but I really fucking hate Olynyk. Yea Cleveland hates Durant but at least he was a great player and beat us on the court. Kelly olynyk cost us a title by putting Kevin love in a shoulder crank
IIRC that was Kelly Olynyk back in his Heat days when he was Pat Riley’s enforcer
"Rockets are better than a Team Canada that could run RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Tristan Thompson, Dillon Brooks, etc etc. Really dude?"
Kelly Olynyk put up  close to a 20/10 with great efficiency on the Rockets too last season when Wood got hurt.   Players putting up obscene numbers on tanking teams don’t translate to playoff teams.  Not to mention he’s a horrific defender.   No team is giving up Wiseman + 7 for a guy like him
"Yeah he sucks compared to *checks notes*  Dante Exum, Rodions Kuruks, Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk  4 first round picks and 5 pick swaps with contenders.   You suck Ben!"
But kelly olynyk . . . That dude can ball!
Ah yes DPOY candidate Kelly Olynyk
So Kelly Olynyk is the franchise centrepiece they wanted?
OP is Kelly Olynyk confirmed.
Kelly Olynyk.
"How is this revionist history? They blew up the roster and rolled out a bunch of a washed up/end of the bench guys because they wanted to keep their pick. They traded PJ/Dipo and cut cousins to lose games. They made Kelly Olynyk a featured player. Look at the lineups they were rolling out over the last 30ish games. It was an intentional disaster.   And nobody forced Wall to play through injuries, he wanted to play because he had been away from the game for 2ish years."
Didn’t Kelly Olynyk put up the same once Wood got hurt?
Better centerpiece than Kelly Olynyk.
"Which is wild cause Canada's golden generation is absurd.  Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, SGA, RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, NAW, Khem Birch, Trey Lyles, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke -- like that's alot of NBA level guys, some of which are projected to be stars asap, some which are now, some who can play D and shoot and grab boards.   No excuse for them not to get bronze or better. Like that list is deep."
"&gt;1. New York Knicks  &gt;majority opinion - Patty Mills and Terrance Ross  &gt;honorable mentions - TJ McConnell, Dunleavy jr, Michael Jordan, Reggie Miller, Jeff Green, Elfrid Payton, Andre Drummond, Trae Young, Sabonis, Tony Snell, Mo Williams, Thad Young, Bradley Beal, Travis Outlaw Jarret Jack, DJ Augustine, Omri Casspi,Kyle Lowry , Kelly Olynyk, Desmond Bane  WTF who said Patty Mills and Terrance Ross if you gave me 100 guesses I would've never gotten that.   1. Trae Young(overreaction to the playoffs)  Honorable mention: Michael Jordan, kept the Knicks best 90s squads from even making the championships, Reggie Miller, the choke, Hakeem, destroyed the Knicks in the Finals first appearance since '72-'73, David Robinson and Tim Duncan, I still have nightmares of Sprewell getting trapped under the basket in the Finals, Lebron James the unbeatable force in Miami. James Dolan because we don't need a reason to hate him."
"I don't know, I still would've taken Simmons. We would've gotten some picks reportedly too. All those firsts could be late. Levert eventually became Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley. Kurucs became DJ Wilson and DJ Augustin. To me it feels like we might end up with a whole lot of nothing for Harden.  Simmons value also wouldn't have plunged so much with us. There wouldn't have been the opportunity for him to shrink in a big moment. We could've flipped him for more assets."
"We have the space to overpay one or two of Duncan Robinson, Kelly Olynyk and Doug McDermott. Those seem to be the best shooters on the market this year lol."
That was a Kelly Olynyk-esque performance from Huerter.
Kelly Olynyk
"I guess by this wounderful logic of yours, the Celtics must have loved passing on Giannis for Kelly Olynyk, since they got to multiple conference finals with him way before Giannis got to his first"
But rockets fans are telling me all those Nets picks and Kelly olynyk is better
"Sorry Rockets for clowning you for trading 1x MVP James Harden for ~~Caris Levert,~~ no wait ~~Victor Oladipo~~, Kelly Olynyk and some late first round picks."
Kelly “The Klynyk” Olynyk is Celtic legend
Kelly Olynyk was.
Because Houston made out like bandits by getting *checks notes* Kelly Olynyk
"I still wouldn’t have given up Herro for Lowry. We needed more than Lowry to succeed. We really missed Crowder most I think. Getting rid of the fairly consistent Kelly Olynyk for Oladipo not to even play hurt as well. I mean, both Herro and Oladipo could turn it around, so not all is lost, but we are a couple years away.   For all those watching though, keep an eye on Crowder, he’s so versatile defensively and can be a great shooter. Miss that guy.."

I'm a big fan of Kelly Olynyk. He's like a big Steph Curry.

"Kelly olynyk MVP season  Seriously tho, go watch what he did for the rockets"
Kelly Olynyk - ripping arms out of sockets
I have to use stats because it's clear you've never watched them play. Embiid is a better facilitator but he just chooses not to ever use that skill? You'd think a good facilitator who has the ball in his hands most of the game would average more assists than Kelly Olynyk but okay.
"&gt;I was just going back the past 10 years. In any job, recent performance is what you are judged on.   Typcially when you're looking back at the career of a person who's recently retired you look at the career of the person...   You're also counting players he didn't actually draft like MarShon Brooks while ignoring players he did draft like Kelly Olynyk.   &gt;Also, how are Zizic and Yabusele decent picks?  They're not, I even listed them as bad picks in the comments below the table?  That might just be how the table is formatted for you. On my screen they're in the bad pick category.   I'll add an extra something into the empty spots to fix that."
"You are missing guys in that list...Here's his career drafting history in the 11-30 range:    Decent Picks| Bad Picks | Unknowns ---|---|---- Kendrick Perkins| Marcus Banks| Romeo Langford Tony Allen |  Delonte West| Grant Williams Al Jefferson|Gerald Green  | Aaron Nesmith Rajon Rondo|J.R. Giddens  |   Avery Bradley|JaJuan Johnson |  Kelly Olynyk|Jared Sullinger|  Terry Rozier| Fab Melo   |  Robert Williams| James Young    |  Payton Pritchard| RJ Hunter|    |Ante Zizic |  |Guerschon Yabusele|  With 9 good picks and 11 bad ones, he's pretty much bang on 50% in that range.  Also worth mentioning, the last 2 'bad picks' (Zizic and Yabusele) were just guys we grabbed who were willing to be stashed for a year because we needed to clear roster spots for incoming stars Al Horford and Gordon Hayward."
draft Giannis ahead of Kelly Olynyk in the 2013 draft. We retain the Brooklyn picks and give Giannis a team where he can be the no. 1 option for years.   We'd have the 3rd picks in 2016&amp;17 (jays) and the 8th pick in 2018 (SGA??)  scaaaary
"Never hire Ernie Grunfield. Save Gilbert Arenas from injury, perhaps maybe accidentally injure Kelly Olynyk in the fourth quarter of that Game 7."
Kelly olynyk game 7 in 2017 goes for 26 points   OG shot in the bubble vs the Celtics game 3
That time Kelly olynyk exploded in a playoff game
Kelly Olynyk basically lol
He has that already in Kelly Olynyk though.
wb 2017 Kelly Olynyk
AD was horrible start to finish this season. Put up worse numbers than Kelly Olynyk and LA's defense was just as good without him

Kelly olynyk. Dude was average as fuck and then went off on the rockets because they literally had nothing to play for.
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"He looks good, he’s skilled for his size and he’s young so he will continue to improve. He probably was slept on in the draft because he’s a big man and he doesn’t have a freakish physical or athletic profile. I’m getting Kelly Olynyk vibes from his offensive game."
"And I honestly believe a lot of people posting here literally did not watch the game.  The Pistons rolled out lineups with 3-4 non-shooters around Cade. This won't happen in the regular season when he has Frank Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant &amp; Kelly Olynyk.   A guy like Cade thrives when he has guys around him who can hit shots, and when there is a real system to run.   Summer League fails to provide both of those aspects."
Game 7 Kelly Olynyk would make a triumphant return
Ah makes sense you guys need all the hope you can get after you traded Harden for 19 games of Kelly Olynyk and some late draft picks
Just wait until we get Kelly Olynyk with the boys
I think the bar for “obviously too good for summer league” is just lower than the bar for “obviously too good for an NBA 8th man”. Like Kelly Olynyk (a certified 8th man) would go absolutely berserk in one of these games.
Thankfully y’all don’t have to watch as often because you took Kelly Olynyk over him
Imagine liking Kelly Olynyk so much that you'd still draft him over Giannis. Classic r/nba
Man if we had giannis in 2017 maybe we could have beat kelly olynyk in game 7.
draft Giannis instead of Kelly Olynyk
Fuck Kelly Olynyk but he's Canadian so he's probably a nice guy
"Basically no NBA players were born in Vancouver, so extending the standard to anyone who grew up in Vancouver or British Columbia in general, we have:  PG Steve Nash SG Bob Houbregs SF Brandon Clarke PF Kelly Olynyk C Robert Sacre  What an incredible squad."
To be fair if you told this sub a year ago that Harden would be traded for Oladipo who would then be traded for Kelly Olynyk you'd have people call you insane. Garbage trade packages aren't always necessarily out of the realm of possibilities. You never know what's going on behind closed doors for some players/teams.
"You guys do you, I’m over here celebrating Kelly Olynyk."
"Precious wasn't even in the discussions from what I remember, it was Dragic, Olynik, Duncan, and Nunn.   *“Miami expressed interest in acquiring Raptors six-time All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry and Goran Dragic, Kelly Olynyk and Kendrick Nunn were discussed,” Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype reported recently.""*  https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/miami\_heat\_have\_made\_a\_kyle\_lowry\_trade\_offer\_to\_the\_toronto\_raptors/s1\_12680\_34352972"
The Lowry butt comments are just as weird as the Kelly Olynyk ones I don’t know why we keep doing this
"Yes you do still get Green, Allen made no impact on the Cavs record and Levert would have been out for 2 months anyway and the Rockets still got the worst record in the league with Kelly Olynyk playing like Larry Bird for 27 games"
Yall still traded Harden for fucking a quarter of a season of Kelly Olynyk some late ass draft picks and swaps which wont convert  Like why didnt you just keep Levert and Allen fam
I must have read the headline too fast because I saw Kelly Olynyk and thought “Really? He’s considered athletic?”
Wtf are you stupid. You’re forgetting kelly olynyk dude
"Forget Josh Smith, the Pistons are paying Blake Griffin over $29 million this season. He's getting almost as much from Detroit this year as Kelly Olynyk and Jerami Grant combined."
"I mean he's getting less money than Zach Collins, who might not ever be healthy enough to play NBA basketball, and Kelly Olynyk, who's a fucking bum."
"SGA, RJ Barrett, Jamal Murray, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Dillon Brooks, Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk. Thats a playoff team. Name 5 countries that can match that talent output. The only thing holding this team back is injuries. Don't be surprised when Canada becomes a legitimate medal threat."
Says the fan of the team who signed Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk bags more money than him.
"The problem is the fact that none of the Canadian guys have played much together before. Luka and the Slovenians have played together many times and even with Luka going to the NBA the guys know how to play their role. Canada is trying to make starters bench guys, bench guys starters, and no one knows how to play FIBA/Euro ball. We had no big bigs at the qualifying tournament (we should have kept that Zach Edey long kid from Purdue he was the only 7 footer) and only guard play is strong.   We also were most likely one Czech game away from making the Olympics I think we just shit the bed that game and were lucky to get it into OT. That was without Jamal Murray, Shai, Dillion Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, Khem Birch, etc.   They just need time playing together so hopefully in 3 years we should make it."
"Well Pistons got the prize of free agency in Kelly ""The Clinic"" Olynyk, so there's that."
Pretty much.  He's not *that* different from Kelly Olynyk.
Kelly Olynyk. I won’t even watch a game if he’s on one of the teams bc looking at him makes me angry.
Put some respect on Kelly Olynyk
lmao? Rafael Stone traded harden for late picks and Kelly Olynyk
"Ontario Canada would give them a run:  Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Rick Fox, Jamal Magloure, Sim Bhullar, James Naismith."
"I don’t think they’re ring chasing. There was not a lot of money left when they signed. The Lakers were smart in waiting for all the big money to be handed out before signing a couple of guys today. They may have missed out on someone yesterday but they’re able to get much better value today. It’s not their fault that someone decided to pay Zach Collins $8M a year, Kelly Olynyk $12M and Gary Trent Jr $18M a year."

Kelly Olynyk lol
This. Him and Jackie Mac both thinking Duncan Robinson was 24 years old instead just looking up His age with 3 second Google search. Or thinking you can get Kelly Olynyk for 4 million a year. His takes are just lazy.
"i read this as Kelly Olynyk at first and was gonna tell you he signed with the Pistons. there's really no reason for me to be telling you this, it's a waste of your time and a poor use of mine. i apologize"
"Last season Kelly Olynyk reached career high assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, FG%, and almost doubled his previous career high PPG on a bad Rockets team. He's a good example of this."
"At 23, he's Kelly Olynyk with a little bit more juice as a shooter and a little bit less all-around skill. So the pros are that he can shoot and handle the ball, he's tall, and he's mobile. The cons are that he's soft and not particularly clever.  As he gets more and more experienced, I think he can be as good as Olynyk all around while being a better outside threat."
"You never have to worry about Kelly Olynyk attacking the rim, OR defenders, he's looking to jack up that 3 every time and stay the hell away from the paint on D"
"Fuck Kelly Olynyk, Cleveland will never forget that dirty cunt"
Kelly Olynyk and Doug McDermott are making more per year than him
"Graham shoots a billion threes on pretty good percentage, is a great passer, and plays okay defense. The fit is great.  Also they're paying him less than Doug McDermott and Kelly Olynyk so idk what the fuck the contract complaints are about"
12 is too much for a backup center with no room for growth. Kelly Olynyk isnt much better than the vet min/&lt;5M centers.
So Weaver and the Pistons trade down 20 spots in the draft to get rid of Plumlee so they could sign a big free agent with their newly acquired 18M worth of cap space  Their big signing? Kelly Olynyk at over 12M a year.  Just wtf.
"I frickin' hate Olynyk but what you gonna do? Go drop 18/9, Machine Gun Kelly!"
"To clarify this point: the Suns CAN sign a very good player with the MLE, so it's fascinating (in a bad way) that they're only tied to guys like javale McGee. A guy like Kelly olynyk could have been within reach."
"Were there no centers available at that price point who aren’t dirty players, though? Fuck Kelly Olynyk."
"jarett allen just signed for 100 million and it damn sure isnt for anything he does on offense.   i agree the pistons need shooters. its not the worst deal, i just dont think kelly olynyk is that good. im over this discussion"
Better this year than last year but still average at best. He's mastering the Kelly olynyk art of drawing charges. Maybe Lowry can help with that too
"Barton contract isn’t bad lol. He’s our best healthy secondary ballhandler and has like 6 years of pnr chemistry with Jokic, is 6’6”, and can create and playmake off the dribble. We need him to stay afloat without Murray and 2/$32 isn’t bad with Bird rights when Kelly Olynyk just got 3/$37. Would have been catastrophic if we lost him and had no viable guy for that role, or had to rely on Gordon to do it."
Idk Kelly Olynyk to Detroit was big to me  And Lonzo confirmed to Chicago with Sato going back.
"Kelly Olynyk just got 3/$37, 2/$32 when we desperately need Barton to stay afloat without Murray isn’t bad at all"
"Yeah, he's probably better than Plumlee. Just a confusing move to me because I thought the whole purpose of dumping Plumlee was to insert Isaiah Stewart full time into the starting lineup, not to sign Kelly Olynyk."
"KELLY ""THE CLINIC"" OLYNYK WILL RESSURECT PISTONS BALL"
19ppg kelly olynyk
Fantasy sleeper Kelly Olynyk
Imagine giving up Christian Wood just to get Kelly Olynyk
Tanking master Kelly Olynyk
FUCK KELLY OLYNYK
"Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk, Jae Crowder, Terry Rozier"
Reggie Jackson and Kelly Olynyk inbound.
Kelly Olynyk is a forward
"They wanted Kelly Olynyk instead and Pat said go fuck yourself, traded for Meyers Leonard and the rest is history. Thank God we traded Hassan instead of Goran man"
"So they're now interested and rumored to be wanting to sign IT, Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk, and Jeff Green.  Brad is truly saying fuck it and resetting the clock to 2017."
"Jeff Green, Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley?  Are Brandon Bass and Tyler Zeller available too??"
"So we traded for Al Horford, want to sign Jeff Green, Avery Bradley, and Kelly Olynyk?   Anyone know what Antoine Walker and Eddie House are up to?"
"I would rather have Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley &amp; Jeff Green."
"Which statistics? His DFG% at the rim is at Kelly Olynyk and Mason Plumlee levels, that's awful"
U mean like kelly olynyk from the rockets?
Paige Bueckers is 5'11 and 140lbs and less agile than Kelly Olynyk
"&gt; Kelly Olynyk did that for Houston,   Glad you mentioned Olynyk.  Because he went off in Houston (a tanking team).  Just like Jerami did in Detroit, another tanking team.    The season before both were on above .500 teams and came nowhere close to those numbers.   &gt; Anyone can pump up volume if you don’t actually care about results.  Couldn't have said it better myself.  Anyone can pump in volume on a tanking team.  Much harder to do when you're competing to win games.        &gt; Wiggins as a teams 3rd best player was still a lottery team last year  Warriors finished the regular season with the 8th best record in the West and then ended up in the first ever play-in tourney.  Any other season and that's a playoff team.    By that logic Malcolm Brogdon and Sabonis are on a lottery team too? Every argument you make you contradict yourself."
Such a dirtbag  https://www.google.com/amp/s/cavsnation.com/draymond-green-refers-kevin-loves-shoulder-injury-calling-kelly-olynyk-dirty/amp/
Kelly fucking olynyk
Maybe everyone took Kelly Olynyk for granted
"[Can’t breathe on Harden, unless you’re Draymond I guess.](https://youtu.be/L2g4RtMj2Ss)  [Can’t breathe on Trae, unless you want to roll over him on a screen.](https://youtu.be/nBxzrHPQyQI)  [Can’t breathe on Luka, unless you’re fellow superstar Kelly Olynyk.](https://youtu.be/RsnaXpKKemk)  [Can’t breathe on Embiid, until it might cost his team the game.](https://kslsports.com/454593/nba-admits-six-missed-calls-late-in-jazz-loss-to-76ers/?)  I can find you some for KD or LeBron or Giannis too if you want. Especially Giannis, because that’s what his game is and it’s not what Jokic’s game is. I’ve seen plenty of Nuggets games. I’ve seen Jokic get plenty of calls on the floor because he’s not in the act of shooting when he gets fouled. I’ve seen refs miss plenty of calls with him too. I’ve also seen every single guy you named go out of their way to draw fouls all the time, which Jokic does not do. And I’ve seen plenty of missed calls on all of them. But you still sit here crying about Embiid like he’s just doing the same shit Jokic does with a better whistle."
how to win the championship 101:  step 1: sign Kelly Olynyk  step 2: injure every other forward  step 3: profit
"I think it is mostly luck and basically a crapshoot. For example the Suns drafted Booker at the 13th pick but he was mocked around there and the Suns would have likely picked Mario Hezonja or Stanley Johnson instead if they fell. Similarly the draft class they got Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss was seen as an amazing draft class but ended up sucking. Kelly Olynyk was drafted by the Celtics who are seen as a great drafting team and I remember during the GM/front office survey he was seen as the biggest steal of the draft and not Giannis who was drafted two picks after him.  Also, another talking point people talk about is ""well, he was drafted by the right team and developed him is the reason he busted."" This may be the case were one team brings up the best of a player more than another to a certain extant but I think this is severely overrated as well for true busts. If this was case we would see a lot more busts who sucked on one team all of a sudden blossom on another that unlocks their potential. For example Josh Jackson was still only 22 years old when the Suns gave up on him and still was extremely young. If he had the super high potential that was hidden away and not developed because of the Suns he would have turned into the next Kawhi lite or w/e when he switched teams. The last time I can think of this sort of happening when one player is seen like a bust and then blossoms on other team is Tobias Harris but even he doesn't entirely fit the scenario."
"Kelly Olynyk, even after he was traded"

How TF does Kelly Olynyk come down with 18 rebounds??
I mean...yea. Fucking Rockets.  Y'all could've had Ben Simmons except your trash organization was too petty to trade with the GM you chased away. Or at least kept LeVert.   Instead you got back...Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley on expiring deals. The four first round draft picks are all awful - Brooklyn and one from Milwaukee.
Christian Wood and Kelly Olynyk. Tall splash brothers
"Smart for a time machine, Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley, who says no?"
Fuck Kelly Olynyk that rat hair having bitch
Fuck Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk looks like he bums cigs off people outside 7/11
Imagine if Rudy Gobert shot the 3 like Kelly Olynyk
I bet Kelly Olynyk vapes
Send over Jaylen and first and we will give your our lord and savior Kelly Olynyk   On serious note wtf is happening with your team ?
Every star got hurt so we started making posts about Kelly olynyk
Kelly Olynyk is not a better player than Oladipo.
Kelly Olynyk&gt;Lebron
The heat rlly threw in the goat Kelly olynyk as a side piece
"Kelly ""Reggie"" Olynyk"
Larry Bird would be Kelly Olynyk if he played today tbh
"Fun story, one time I was at a Pistons game and we were playing the Cs when they had Olynyk on the team. We are Pistons fans but obviously when a long haired legend is playing in your city you gotta root for him, every board every bucket every play we were yelling ""KELLYYYY"". A whole group of kids was on a field trip in front of us and every time we did that they turned around laughing and called Kelly a bum and bad non stop, just jawing us back and forth. Those kids had so much fun trash talking us all because we were LOVING Kelly."
Is Kelly Olynyk better then prime Dirk? Yes. Yes he is.
#7: Kelly Olynyk
"I'd make them watch clips of CP3, Kelly Olynyk, Zaza Pachulia, Bruce Bowen, and the like. Can't score on us if they're dead nomsayin'?"
We barely avoided the natural disasters that are Sterling Brown and Kelly Olynyk
"Good game. Rockets actually played pretty well. Since Kelly Olynyk got here, he has been the best player on the team. The suns are legit. That Cp3/Booker backcourt is a fucking monster. I could see y'all making a run in the postseason."
KJ Martin   Kevin Porter Jr  Kelly Olynyk  Tate
Kelly Olynyk needs to be in the MVP conversation
Kelly Olynyk revenge game confirmed. He scored 0 points on the suns in his last game as the Heat.
Kelly Olynyk.
You’d rather have Kelly Olynyk though? I think people were clowning the difference between the packages. Y’all could’ve flipped Ben down the line too
nah bro its superstars Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk lmao
Well y'all did get Avery Bradley and Kelly olynyk instead
"6’10 with a 6’11 wingspan is fine, smaller players can’t ‘reliably’ contest that. Y’all had Kelly Olynyk who’s 7’0 with a 6’9 wingspan on your team and he was a great shooter, he wasn’t getting contested by smaller players"

Kelly Olynyk does this all the time....he'll look like Canadian Jesus for 3-4 games and then shoot 5 for 39 from 3 over the next 7 games
Yeah you guys are way better with Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk who needs him
Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk is legitimately a good player and has been for awhile.
damn you kelly olynyk  DAMN YOU *shakes fist at the heavens*
"Someone recently posted a thread asking something like ""which non-star player always goes off against your team?"" First thought was Kelly Olynyk vs Pels but thought I'd get trashed and was too lazy to make my argument"
Lmao get outta here with that  Oladipo is a far superior defender and Kelly calling card is his shooting and he’s streaky at that  He’s played well at Houston but calling Olynyk better than Oladipo is an insult
Yes because Kelly Olynyk is a bum
Are you trusting Kelly olynyk to be consistent
I'd say this is the least athletic team of players that get at least 26 min per game:  PG- Ricky Rubio  SG- Joe Harris  SF- Joe Ingles  PF- Kelly Olynyk  C- Brook Lopez
I'd say this is the least athletic team of players that get at least 26 min per game:  PG- Ricky Rubio  SG- Joe Harris  SF- Joe Ingles  PF- Kelly Olynyk  C- Brook Lopez

Still much better than Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk tho lmao
Kelly Olynyk
 Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk.
"I mean look at Miami's playoff rotation last year... they played Bam at the 5 exclusively and played mostly small. The only big they played besides Bam was Kelly Olynyk, who was a stretch big, and he only played like 15 minutes/game, which is backup minutes. He was *9th* in their team in minutes played per game, same as Dwight. Markieff can absolutely be that backup big for 15 minutes/game. Meyers Leonard got the JaVale treatment, at best 10 minutes per game as a token starter, at worst straight up DNPs.   That's what the modern game is in the playoffs man, playing a versatile big like Bam/AD at the 5, and you have one traditional backup big who absorbs 10-15 minutes/game, and the rest of the players playing are guards or wings."
There’s no way they don’t have beef. Wall is more willing to pass to fucking kelly olynyk than wood
What does Kelly Olynyk have to do with this? /s
How do you get crossed up by KELLY OLYNYK LMFAO
Yeah I heard the “kelly olynyk playing point guard” statement and took it as a joke but then I realized it might actually be happening. Is Kelly olynyk actually playing point guard?
And they’d still have gotten effectively nothing franchise-changing for harden except for some middle schooler and half a year of Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk
I honestly love listening to the Rockets broadcast. They really seem to really love Kelly Olynyk. Also their announcers just openly called the Celtics a “disappointing” team.  Lmao no filter. Both of them are willing to say that certain teams are shit.
"In a vacuum - how is Harden for Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley, and picks in the late 20s equitable value?"
I think the screwed up that trade - they traded Harden for a bunch of late round picks and essentially Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley...
Imma be honest Kelly Olynyk is better than Oladipo we fleeced em
Pickswap (between Nets and Mia IIRC) and Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley.
they really gave Danuel House Kelly Olynyk
Can't believe Nets had the pieces to trade for Kelly Olynyk and only got James Harden smh
did kelly olynyk arrive in houston and just decide he was gonna be a star?
uhhh excuse me? remind me which team has kelly olynyk on it again?
Imagine trading Harden for Kelly Olynyk because you were butthurt your GM left for another city.
"I'm pretty sure it was leaked at some point, Simmons Maxey Shake and 3 firsts. Houston instead got 4 firsts, Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley and 4 swaps most of which will likely be worthless."
have fun with *checks roster* kelly olynyk lol
Yeah we totally didn’t offer a way better package than the one you got from the Nets. Enjoy those shit pick swaps and Kelly Olynyk
Damn RoLo looking like Kelly Olynyk with that hairstyle  RIP Sideshow Bob
"yes, Ben Simmons or Caris LeVert is better than Kelly Olynyk"
So Kelly olynyk Avery Bradley and some pick swaps?
"Fertitta let his ego/pride get the best of him and he refused to deal with Morey. He's dumb. Could've had your ""big three"" for the next couple years consisting of Ben Simmons, John Wall, and Christian Wood. Could've also had Matisse Thybulle as well along with a couple of first round picks.  That man really could've had the perfect setup for a post Harden rebuild. He would have Simmons be his big ticket guy who got people to go to a Rockets game and to build the team around. Silas wouldn't have to suffer through a dreadful first season as a HC with nothing to work with and constant losses. The team would've had first round picks which the Rockets desperately needed. On top of all that I feel a roster with John Wall, Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Kelly Olynyk, and DJ Augustin on it would've definitely been able to get the Rockets into a play-in game and possibly sneak into the playoffs. At the very least, it'd be a decent team going forward and you have SOMETHING to get Rockets fans on board with and excited about. Shit, chances are if the roster looked like that Demarcus Cousins and PJ Tucker possibly would've stayed for the rest of the season and helped the team out even more.  Bottomline man, don't let emotions and pettiness keep you from seeing the bigger picture. Fertitta could've had the Rockets hit the ground running once Harden was traded. Instead he let the team trip and fall flat on its face then skid along the ground into a 20 game losing streak and likely last place finish at the end of this season with not all that much to look forward to next season.  I just hate seeing any team completely fall apart due to a shitty owner. I've seen it too many times and wouldn't wish it on any team. Besides the Nets."
"Do you mean to tell me the best they would have gotten for LeVert is Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk, and a pick swap?"
Ben alone (in my not at all biased opinion) basically would have beaten the Harden package. they got a bunch of FRPs (lets face it none will be as good as Ben) and then basically Kelly Olynyk and that other guy who I forget. And the Sixers were also offering Maxey and picks. Its crazy how bad Tilman fucked up
"&gt; Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley, a couple pick swaps and a few future firsts  That is a totally normal package, find a new Rainforest Cafe."

"im only half joking, but Kelly Olynyk is legit a better player than Oladipo right now"
"The 76ers reportedly offered Simmons, Thybulle and 2 firsts for Harden. Gotta think that package would’ve been better than... checks notes... Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley, a couple worthless pick swaps and a few future firsts"
They did make the 2nd round and would’ve went to the ECF if not for Kelly Olynyk going berserk
Sure glad we we've got Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk.
Kelly played well today but I know I didn’t just hear the Rockets commentator say they got a good piece in a ‘young Kelly Olynyk’ for Oladipo
"Or ""thanks for being petty Tilman, could've gotten an all-star, all-NBA, DPOY candidate and some picks and talents, but Kelly Olynyk and meaningless pick swaps are just as good"""
"Herro and DRob are in a weird slump.  Kelly Olynyk and Leonard being gone meant their fake handoffs, off ball screens and stretching the floor are gone.  Jae being weirdly hot from the 3 last year also gone.  Love it or hate it, guys like KO, Leonard, Jae and DJJ were huge during the regular season last year. Sure, most barely played in the post season but still gotta play those 82(72) games to get in."
"&gt; Stone on DJ Wilson: ""He (fits) in similarly to Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley as guys that can stabilize things and also help show our young guys how to play. He was definitely an important component.""  ""We feel he's really going to make an immediate impact in showing our borderline talent how to excel at receiving no minutes riding the deep bench."""
Kelly Olynyk is an elite level shoulder-dislocator and highly undervalued
So basically you're saying that Blake Griffin is just Kelly Olynyk with a prank show
"My comp is Kelly Olynyk.  Kelly Olynyk is not a particularly good NBA player (enough of a mediocre player no one really cares that he was traded as salary filler on Oladipo) and has pretty similar stats this year to Griffin.  But if you told me Kelly Olynyk was the 8th or 9th best player on a team, I'd tell you that team probably has top-level depth.  That's the Nets, except Olynyk is Blake Griffin and they have 3 Superstars."
"What are you talking about?   The Lakers had to play the Miami super team at full strength. Lebron, AD, and KCP all got injured in the first half of game 1, but Lebron persevered and played through his injury putting up 2 of the best finals games of all time up in the series. The Lakers were still able to blowout Miami in game 6, even with Miami goon Kelly Olynyk giving Lebron a concussion at the end of game 5 with a cheap shot to the head when Lebron was driving to the basket.   -What Lakers fans tell themselves happened in the finals."
"People were saying he's not especially good.  And he's not.  But he's still better than the average role player in the NBA, which is his role on the Nets.  It's like saying I wouldn't want Kelly Olynyk to start on my team but I'd love to have him as a buyout guy:  talent and value is directly proportional to your role."
"LMAOOOOO that’s like trading james harden for kelly olynyk and some pick swaps :,)))))"
"I know you thought you hit me with a 'gotcha!' there, but no, I'm not. As an objective fan I think that the AD situation was shady &amp; not in the competitive spirt of the game, but I'm not gonna renounce my fandom since it happened.   Regardless, the AD trade situation isn't even nearly as bad as the Harden situation. AD requested a trade specifically to Lakers, which was shitty in terms of tanking his value, but Harden tanked his value 10x more with all the blatant shit he did to the point where Houston only got Kelly Olynyk and some picks from the trade.  Harden tanked his value by partying in a stripclubs in the height of a pandemic (with no mask), didn't show up to training camp for a while, demanded a trade multiple times while under contract for longer than AD was, purposely quit on the team in certain games, hurt the new Head Coach they brought in by being so uncooperative and (with the nail in the coffin) essentially said ""This team is fucking garbage"" in order to get traded the very next day.  Stop being dishonest; what Harden did was far worse and you know it. You're corny asf for trying to hit people with 'gotcha!' moments over double standards when this is shit we generally should be able to agree on."
"Kelly Olynyk scored 24 points off the bench in the finals, watch your damn mouth"
KAT  Anthony Edwards  John Wall  Christian Wood  Kelly Olynyk   I could see them winning a game
"We gave up Olynyk and replaced him with Ariza and Deadmon who do everything we needed from Kelly but better, so in a way we still upgraded despite losing Oladipo"
Your team had Kelly Olynyk lol
"Kelly Olynyk,  because of his face mostly.  I just want to punch it for some reason."
K Love said fuck the celtics and Kelly Olynyk
"&gt;Hm Oladipo's right leg is falling apart this is second surgery on the same leg, I think you'd have to smoke some drugs to say Lavert is a concern like that.   Sure, if your goal is to stay mediocre for the next 5 years  &gt;You traded for Oladipo giving up Lavert and all you got was an expiring Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley and a pick in the 18-20 overall area. The Rockets did do a great job at staying mediocre you are right at that.  Both are expiring deals, picks can be traded, and the Rockets have a great young core including KPJ who is better than both Levert and Dipo.   Yeah, but I’m the one grasping for straws"
"Very good line and he's showing that he can help the Lakers, but it shows how few people watch the highlights let alone the actual games when they're getting hyped over this.  Drummond was going against Kelly Olynyk ffs ... you'd have to actually be stupid enough to believe that he's the worst starting center in the league to get excited about him doing well in that matchup."

"I can see that, though on the other hand Bam was never coming back with full health that series, maybe the best play was gamble all-in Olynyk and pray you’re getting 2017 game 7 Kelly."
"That was one of Spo’s bigger mistakes I think. A healthy Bam is a better player clearly, but it was a bad matchup for him to begin with and a healthy Olynyk was spacing the court for them. If he kept Kelly in I don’t think the Heat would have won, but it would have been closer imo"
Uhh we were forced to trade for westbrook. A team's future is still payment for any superstar lol. Dipo was traded for kelly olynyk + a 2022 pick swap. With how well KO has been playing we got good value. We lost out on the levert swap but you cant predict everything 🤷🏻‍♂️
"Really grasping at straws to back your losing argument.  &gt; I'd say they're pretty equal  Hm Oladipo's right leg is falling apart this is second surgery on the same leg, I think you'd have to smoke some drugs to say Lavert is a concern like that.  &gt; Sure, if your goal is to stay mediocre for the next 5 years  You traded for Oladipo giving up Lavert and all you got was an expiring Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley and a pick in the 18-20 overall area.

As a former cavs fan. Fuckkkk kelly olynyk
Rockets have kelly olynyk
"Spoelstra couldn’t figure out how to unlock Kelly Olynyk lol  More likely Olynyk’s usage rate is through the roof because he’s on a 16-54 team. And yeah, he’s shooting 3s at slightly above league average, credit where credit is due."
Kelly olynyk 50 point triple double incoming
Except Kelly olynyk. Fuck Kelly olynyk. All my homies hate Kelly olynyk.
"Kelly Olynyk &gt;&gt;&gt; Victor Oladipo  * A) I’m not just making a hyperbolic post, it’s absolutely true and you know it  * B) I could have told you this with confidence before the trade  * C) It was absolutely true even before KO blew up in Houston  * D) it was true even if Dipo didn’t get injured"
"Dedmon off the bench is an All-Star player compared to the terrible minutes Kelly Olynyk provided this year to Miami. Kelly wasn't replaced by Dedmon though, Ariza is the better player that replaced him in the starting five"
yea what a steal u got kelly olynyk for the player you traded away levert for
He running from that Kelly Olynyk CLINIC
"If you seriously think Dedmon hasn't been a big reason for the Heat hitting their stride, then you have not watched any of the past 14 games. The Heat have a net rating of +19.9 when he's on the floor (meaning they are outscoring their opponents by 20 points per 100 possessions while he's on the floor).  &gt;did you forget who Dedmon is playing with and who Kelly O is playing with lmao?  When Olynyk was playing with this Heat team they had a below .500 record lmao since adding Dedmon they've gone .714"
Dedmon is way more important to this team than Kelly ever was. Rebounding and good defense when Bam sits. Olynyk never provided that
We get to swap Nets pick for yalls pick which is def gonna be worse than Brooklyns.  We also got Kelly Olynyk who has been playing out of his mind
Kelly olynyk died for this
"Canada could have a good ass team.   Jamal Murray / RJ Barrett / Andrew Wiggins / Dwight Powell / Chris Boucher with Shai, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, Trey Lyles, Khem Birch is a hella respectable team."
Kelly Olynyk
"No, but they had the choice of taking those two players or Oladipo, and they chose Oladipo and then swapped him for Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley, both on expiring contracts, so it kinda works out the same."
Nah its Heat all time great Kelly Olynyk
"Either way, if I were you, I'd be more confident in the future having an all-nba/all-defense 24 year old guard on my team, who I can trade for assets at any time compared to Oladipo, (who got traded for a 2nd and kelly olynyk), a first, and one or two frp swaps"
How much help does Kelly Olynyk need
Kelly Olynyk is not the absolute ugliest person in the NBA. Possibly.

"""Have you had sex with Kelly Olynyk? Is that why you're defending him so strongly?""  Of course someone like you wouldn't be able to understand intent; in your mind the primary justification for any person's actions would be to defend a sexual partner.

"LMAO you are completely insane. I just showed you the tape and a screenshot: [this](https://i.imgur.com/d3sd9lN.png) was not a legal play on the basketball. He locked Love's extended arm with both of his and pulled on it, *while the ball was touching Love's other hand.* You can't just kick a dude in the dick or throw an elbow at his head and claim it was just an accident in the heat of the moment.  You have no idea what was going through Olynyk's mind, you are just assuming it was an accident. iNtEnTiOnAlItY, a reckless play that endangers your opponent is still dirty even if you weren't actively trying to injure them, you absolute clown.  What is wrong with you? How are you this stupid and this confident in your batshit crazy logic? Have you had sex with Kelly Olynyk? Is that why you're defending him so strongly?"
Knicks are an easy win for the Lakers even without Lebron. Lakers will definitely need Lebron against KPJ and Kelly Olynyk.
Fuck Kelly Olynyk
"I'd also  Kelly Olynyk, Kevin Porter Jr and KJ Martin would be three od their better players."
How much better is AD than Kelly Olynyk?
People still think Kelly Olynyk -intentionally- made that play where he got locked arms with Kevin Love as if he was a BJJ black belt trying to take him down.
"Yeah I guess so, but there are plenty of guys who score efficiently but they don't have much help so they are the only one who can score well, it doesn't mean the stats are empty, cuz someone needs to score points. Guys like Kelly olynyk, jerami grant, Collin sexton, Shai gilgeous Alexander, Zach Lavine, KAT. They all score efficiently and in bunches but their teams are below average or bottom feeders, but they aren't empty scorers. I think jerami is for sure not more than a 3rd option on a championship team but he is with us and helps keep the team from getting blown out every night"
Kelly Olynyk*
Kelly Olynyk &gt; your favorite player  Also I just think Spo didn't know how to use him with Bam lol he put up similar numbers while Bam was out for a few games Houston's free-flowing offense is just a much better fit for him

Kelly Olynyk is better than Drummond
Wdym he just did this against DPOY candidate Kelly Olynyk
"Ok I'm wrong. We had a bunch of blow outs in that streak. I watch whole games so I guess I just tend to remember the anxious moments more. The Spurs game was rough and in that Rockets win, while it was a blowout, also had anxious moments when dudes like Kelly Olynyk and Armani Brooks went ballistic from 3."
The only player I hate more than Kelly Olynyk is Mike Dunleavy
"Let it be known that the Rockets, led by KJ Martin, Kelly Olynyk, and DaQuan Jeffries are tied with the Bucks, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, and Jrue Holiday after the first quarter."
"Khem Birch for team Canada as well, after seeing him on the Raptors hes a guy who def adds something. Also Kelly Olynyk has been playing well lately."
What happened to Kelly?! Wtf did you guys to do Olynyk!
Why would you only mention the Celtics injuries and disregard the Heat though? Their guys have been in and out of line ups for the entire season with injuries and covid. In fact the guy they brought in to help them (oladipo) is literally injured for an undisclosed amount of time and they traded kelly olynyk someone who was a heavy rotational player to get him. Both teams are near identical when it comes to injuries and covid and they have the exact same record
"That part was supposed to be a joke my guy.  It was supposed to make someone laugh, if you didn’t find it funny I’m sorry.  I don’t have anything against Kelly Olynyk if that’s what you’re implying.  Nor do I really care if others think he’s homely.  My goal is not to persuade here.  Don’t look too far into this."

Luckily Kelly Olynyk will lead them to greatness
"He’s got insane quickness for a guy his size and has been showing much better instincts and general comfort on the court when he gets consistent playing time this year. His flashes are good enough to where I feel comfortable saying his potential peak will be nowhere near Kelly Olynyk lol, the two are not very comparable imo"
You all literally replaced Kelly Olynyk for a dude on a vet-min and it's working.
Smh. Disrespect to Kelly fucking Olynyk who has been balling out.    I'm excited for the growth of team Canada. We have so many guys coming up. Love to see it.
"Kelly Olynyk is who he's referring to. And he's a Bucks killer, they got rid of him."
Kelly olynyk woulda blocked that
Kelly olynyk woulda blocked that too
Kelly Olynyk could never.
"&gt;Joke or no, Kelly Olynyk has actually been very good this year.  I'll take sentences I never thought I'd hear *and* be sad about months ago for $1000, Aaron"
"Everyone knows Olynyk can bomb it from three, but in 21 games with Houston he's shooting **70.8% from two**.   I don't think people understand just how ridiculous that is for a guy who isn't a dunker, or even for a guy who IS a dunker. Rudy Gobert currently leads the league at 68.2% and that's with 208 dunks in 63 games. Kelly Olynyk has 8 dunks in 21 games.

Go give Tyler Johnson and Kelly Olynyk $50 mil each again dude.
Kelly Olynyk has been going crazy in Houston too
"Seems like everybody this Wood is a true 4 and I need to dispel that idea. I’ve watched basically all the games this season and he is a true center. He’s so often paired with Olynyk because Kelly can actually switch onto the perimeter while playing the 4 unlike Wood. So yeah Capela is the more sound player in terms of what you’re gonna get every night, a better role player than Wood, but Wood is more tailored to have offenses built around him. I give Capela the slight edge right now but I see that changing"

"The Kelly Olynyk special. That guy's got a knack for tangling his body with other people on the basketball court. You've got guys like Ersan who made a career out of taking charges, but nobody's got the bodycount that Kelly Olynyk has.  Even throwing away the obvious Kevin Love shoulder stuff that Kelly has in his past, he's always getting his feet under guys leading to twisted ankles."
Kelly Olynyk is averaging 18/8 on 70% TS since the trade btw

Can they really get get kelly olynyk without trading steph I mean I took harden to get him
Kelly Olynyk is going to get the contract that Victor Oladipo was hoping for.
They need kelly olynyk.
Why is Kelly olynyk so good now I gotta start watching rocket games
"[Kevin O’Connor of The Ringer reported Sunday that the Miami Heat are “pursuing a deal for Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry harder than anyone.” He added that if Lowry gets dealt, his preferred destination would be to Miami due to his friendship with Jimmy Butler.](https://www.hothothoops.com/2021/3/21/22343686/miamj-heat-kyle-lowry-trade-duncan-robinson-tyler-herro-kelly-olynyk-lamarcus-aldridge)  [Lowry's top destination if he is traded is reportedly Miami, Tim Reynolds of the Associated Press reported Tuesday.](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-kyle-lowry-prefers-miami-heat-as-trade-destination)  cry more 🤡  he gone (just like every star in Raptor history) + Masai is washed"
Commercial was fine. Like seeing Kelly Olynyk in a Colt45 commercial tho
Kelly Olynyk or Giannis
Terrible overrated player.  Mavs should trade for Hamidou Diallo and Kelly Olynyk 🤝
"and yet Kelly Olynyk and Isaiah Stewart would be instant starters for us. Olynyk can at least shoot a basketball and even pass! Stewart can rebound a basketball and plays with hustle. They're not the best, but they are NBA guys"
Kelly Olynyk out here catching strays
Kelly Olynyk is much better than people think he is.
"Are y’all forgetting about Kelly?? Olynyk, not Oubre"
"I think there's a certain amount of truth to that. A lot of fans don't want to admit to themselves that they sometimes cheer more for the white guy, even when it doesn't make sense. For instance, our sub LOVES Luka Garza. Never seen a pick in the 50s who can't play defense get showered with so much love so quickly lmao.  But in this case, I think it has more to do with the history of the Morris twins, and the fact that Markief clearly instigated the shoving match.  Also remember, everybody hated on Grayson Allen for his dirty stuff too, and Kelly Olynyk. Like I said, I don't think you're coming out of left field with your assessment, but it's definitely not a constant either."
Average doesn't mean bad. Average means you're probably good enough to stay in the league for a while but you won't ever be a top option on a good team. That describes someone like Kelly Olynyk pretty well.   If a big man putting up 10/5 year after year doesn't qualify as average then I don't know what average would mean.
"There are 15 players on rosters and people will bring in some way above average players who they think are average but far from that  Examples in this thread Marvin Williams is far from average, 10/5 on good efficiency his entire career for 1000+ games is far from average, same with Kelly Olynyk 10/5 on great efficiency"
Kelly Olynyk
"Unfortunately thats super unlikely to happen, undersized hustle guys like him just don't last in the league, *especially* ones that can't shoot either. The only reason he even gets any minutes is because the Pistons drafted him so it would be dumb not to give him a chance, plus his competition for minutes is fucking Kelly Olynyk and some dude named Luka Garza.   Doubt he lasts beyond his rookie contract unless he **majorly** develops or settles for minimum type contracts and because an end of the bench guy that only plays when the starting C is injured.   It's unfortunate but on the bright side, if he's smart at all with his money, which is doubtful given how he has severe anger management issues and is clearly incredibly emotional, he should be able to live the rest of his life off of his rookie contract earnings."
"Miami Heat, Duncan Robinson. Last season it was Kelly Olynyk but he got traded mid-season."
A couple of weeks ago Jackie Mac was on the bill Simmons pod talking about how Kelly olynyk used to make her irrationally angry even when he got better. Grant Williams is that player for me. I audibly groan every time that guy touches the ball. What does it say about the roster that he plays big minutes?
We have a pretty solid squad now but if you asked me a year ago i would say Kelly olynyk.
"Do you think he's on the block? I'd like the Pistons to take a chance on him if he's available. He'd certainly be better than Trey Lyles, and he could probably play at the same time as Kelly Olynyk when he comes back."
"I own a Kelly Olynyk Heat jersey.  And people always asked whether or not I had it custom made because ""there is no way the NBA is selling Kelly Olynyk jerseys."""
"Oooh aren’t you such a good guy  Obviously we watch sports differently. I watch to root for my team and I don’t fuck with any disrespect.   You must have forgotten that Clippers staffers were advised to not wear any team gear while walking around Memphis.   ZBO didn’t fuck with Blake Griffin, so neither did I.   Draymond Green poked Mike Conleys broken eye, fuck him for life for that.   This one doesn’t even have to do with my team but I’ll never forget it. Fuck Kelly Olynyk for pulling Kevin Loves shoulder out.   It’s ok to dislike players that do shitty things, ya know?"
"We offered him literally the most we could without trading pretty much everyone else on our team so we could max him which would then place us with 3 max contract players on our team. By this point by the way Jimmy had already been leaking stories about his unhappiness with the Wolves, he also didn’t fly back with the rest of the team to Minny after our playoff loss and refused to participate in the standard end of season medical exam.   The trade with the Heat broke down because for once in his life Thibs was smart and decided Kelly Olynyk, Josh Richardson, and a 1st wasn’t enough. Jimmy was fair to be pissed off, but publicly humiliating the Wolves wasn’t a professional way to handle it.   Wolves fans can admit the organization shares some of the blame, but the fact you guys think Jimmy was completely in the right is hilarious. The dudes forced his way out of 2 teams now and is on his 4th team since becoming a star, maybe, JUST maybe, he’s a bit hard to please. Regardless this is a pointless argument, I don’t like Jimmy Butler that much, it’s nice to beat a guy who trashed your team, if you are that upset about it then oh well. Gg tonight"
Fuck Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk
I think last season Kelly Olynyk had a 30 brick streak with us at one point early on.
"LMAO revisionist history. If you ask r/NBA who are the dirtiest players, 3 out of the top 10 would be Kelly Olynyk and Grayson Allen and Zaza Pachulia. Why are you making shit up?"
"With Kelly Olynyk out and Isaiah Stewart suspended, I thought maybe this was Detroit's chance to give Ben Wallace some spot minutes at the five."
I never want Kelly Oubre to succeed because he punched Kelly Olynyk like 5 years ago
Kelly Olynyk cost us a championship in 2015
Wasn’t Kelly Olynyk the pick before Giannis. I know you can say that for alot of guys but geez that hurts.
Kelly Olynyk is a bitch
"Pistons are also still paying DeAndre, so two of their top five cap hits aren’t even on their team, and a third is Kelly Olynyk! :P"
"i wasnt implying that he is loved for being white, i was just saying that he is a fan favorite even among fans of other teams and neutrals and that’s why he doesn’t get labeled as a dirty player that often. whereas kelly olynyk and like you said, grayson allen get frequently (and fairly) labeled as dirty players because, well, they are dirty players. but they’re not as loved nor as good as jokic, which both attribute to their widespread criticism."
"A lot more.  And they have to be unquestionably dirty, not subject to interpretation.    First video, nothing there is intentional or unquestionable.  All were doing in the moment, chasing guys around with your adrenaline pumping, you sometimes get tangled up, it happens.    It only looks bad because Livingston was going so fast, that push happens in every game and is a common foul at best.  Bron didn't push Embiid, he prevented him from jumping into him by putting his hands up and preventing the body from making contact.  It just so happens Embiid was already too committed and didn't have one leg back for balance.  Plus it came really fast, Lebron looked like he was going to jump for it but decided not to and his hands were already up.  I don't disagree with the flagrant though, you have to punish these things based on the outcome and not the intention.  Slide tackle you already said wasn't dirty, moving on.  Knee to Steph's balls was dirty and intentional.  Elbow to Iggy's balls, not dirty and not intentional.  Standard basketball move to drive with the off arm protecting the body.  You see how low Lebron was when he was driving?  Normally guys would be standing straighter and that elbow would be in the chest area, but Lebron was going fast and low and Iggy just happened to be in the wrong spot.  Kick to Iggy's balls, not dirty or intentional.  Guys do this a dozen times a game, it only makes the news when it connects.  Reggie Miller made a career out of doing this and getting fouls.  Should be a foul on the shooter though, they need to control that, but its not a dirty play.  Mikal Bridges looks bad, but 90% of the time guys will go for a forward-facing dunk and the little push will result in the ball being bobbled.  Its only bad luck that he went for the reverse so the push made him land on his back.  If you look at the exact moment when he goes up with the ball, he and Lebron are facing the same way.  Bridges changes in mid-air, so that's not Lebron's fault.    Payne...slap?  That wasn't even a push, at most Lebron slap him on the thigh, not dirty.  The Ayton push is open to interpretation.  Its a push, a small one on the mid-upper back area.  It feels more like a defeated resignation than a cheap shot.  Lebron haters can have this one since its not clear its unintentional.  The Ayton hit is obviously a harder hit than what we're used to seeing, which is a standard screen.  He didn't have to put so much force into it, and in that way you can say it was dirty.  However, in another way, a harder than usual hit doesn't make something dirty necessarily, I doubt Lebron was trying to hurt him.  A dirty move should either be intended to injure, or so reckless that injury is all but certain.  This was neither, it was a hard hit, but within the realm of legal hits.  If I were Barkely saying it on TNT, people would be praising me for being ""old-school"".  This is exactly the kind of stuff he and Shaq would totally support.  Its a hard hit, but completely legal, not intended to injure, and not dirty.  So by my count, with the first link having 7 unintentional or non-dirty hits, that's 17 moves, only 1 was absolutely a dirty move, 2 were intentional and possibly reckless (push to Ayton's back, and shoulder screen on Ayton) but within the realm of gameplay, and the rest were accidents, people moving too quickly, unintentional, or just common plays that happen all the time.  Like I said, actual dirty plays should be intended to injure, or so reckless as to have a high chance of causing injury.  Something like [Bruce Bowen's kick to Wally Szczerbiak's face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edb6bz_C9ms) is dirty because its intentional.  Metta's [elbow to Harden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnayIPA0Yfk) is dirty because its totally reckless and overboard.  Rodman [intentionally getting in Malone's way constantly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdUT3GPlGwU) and then tripping him is dirty.  Kelly Olynyk [pulling down on Kevin Love's arm is dirty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ31539Cg04).  And clearly Andrew Bynum [hitting JJ Barea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIWSKssJP2E) is unquestionably dirty.  All of those were intentional motions, and Metta's was severely reckless as well.  But there's a lot of other moves that are bad looking but not dirty, because they don't fit the criteria above.  Last year, Chris Paul [pushed Giannis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eezPRN6wAgg) at the closing seconds of game 5 when Giannis was going in for an alley oop.  While I agree it was completely intentional, given the stakes, I don't think Chris intended it to be as bad as it looks, it was just a desperation push to try and save a championship, you have to take nerves and the situation into account.  It was a bit reckless, and if it was anyone other than Giannis it might have turned out badly, but not enough for me to say ""Yeah he intended to hurt him with recklessness"".    Another non-dirty play was when Wade [broke Kobe's nose during the 2012 All-Star game with a missed grab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yO8ukhIehQ).  We've all seen plays like this before, guy goes up for the dunk and the other guy tries to grab him around the arms and shoulders so he can't go up.  Only this time Wade missed and hit Kobe's nose instead.  Looks bad, but not dirty.  And then there's this classic from the 2002 WCF between the Lakers and Kings.  Kobe [elbows Bibby's nose while trying to get free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbWgWZjo1nI).  Again, its a move we've seen a thousand times before if you've watched any amount of basketball.  Guy tries to get free, moves his arm through.  Only this time it caught Bibby's nose.  Lakers haters will say Kobe did it intentionally and its up for interpretation.  But what is NOT up for interpretation is that this move happens all the time.  1 out of a thousand times it'll hit someone in the face, but its not dirty.  Its well within the range of normal gameplay.    Doesn't matter if a Lakers fan is saying this, I've included plenty of non-Lakers examples.  Plus, I don't care if people think Lebron is dirty, his legacy is made by how many championships he wins, not how many guys he hits.  I'll defend him, CP3, and Wade as well in those examples.  Dirty has to be more than a few bumps and pushes during gameplay."
"this might be anecdotal but kelly olynyk is a common go-to example of a dirty player who’s still in the league. i think the narrative around jokic moreso has to do with how popular he is among users in this sub, he’s almost universally liked and cheered for. luka is another example, takes a lot of criticism for being whiny/dirty on the court when he doesn’t get his way"
"One season 3% variance shouldn't be assumed to be true. He's had a couple of good seasons, a couple of bad seasons, he's a mediocre shooter. He also doesn't shoot off the dribble well or shoot off screens, and his shooting numbers come mostly from the corner (~33% on non-corner 3s).   Finishing at the rim is what I highlighted as a good trait.    EPM at 64th is by far the best. DPM has him outside the top 100. But I also think that if you were to go around telling people that you think Wiggins is about as good as Kelly Olynyk, Batum, and Garland, you'd be considered a hater. I would agree he's looking very solid, but the guy I was responding to said he was a fringe all star player. There's a lot of people clustered near Wiggins even in EPM where we'd have 60-70 fringe all star players."
"He’s very frequently talked shit about Cleveland, especially after leaving. He was not very good during his time in Cleveland either. He was also on that Celtics team in 2015 when they were fighting every game after the K Love injury (also, fuck Kelly Olynyk)."
last week one of my opponents tried to offer me a trade of Kelly Olynyk + Mitchell Robinson + Cory Joseph in exchange for  LeBron + Jaylen Brown 😔. I obviously declined the offer and still lost (still winless in my fantasy league) but damn those injuries have my team disrespected
Did you forget kelly olynyk vs the wizards already
Ben Simmons + Shake Milton = Pistons   Kelly Olynyk + Harrison Barnes + Saddiq Bey = 76ers  Jerami Grant = Kings
He’s ducking Kelly Olynyk smh
"Here's the breakdown of the Grant rumor from the article:  &gt;League sources have said the team is having ongoing discussions with the Detroit Pistons to acquire Grant, another forward, a young player, and a draft pick in exchange for Simmons. One source said power forward/center Kelly Olynyk and second-year swingman Saddiq Bey were mentioned as players who could be included in a possible deal. However, a source said the Pistons are unlikely to include Bey, a Villanova product, or Olynyk.  &gt;A person close to the Sixers said the team would want a more high-profile player than Grant in exchange for Simmons. The source added that the team hasn’t spoken to the Pistons lately.  &gt;But multiple sources said they have, and that the discussions were centered around Grant. The Athletic reported Thursday the Sixers have a list of 30 players they’d accept in a Simmons trade."
"AD has literally shied away from defending Giannis in the past and just generally, he picks when he wants to play well on defense. Tonight was just one of those games he's decided, ""Ehh, I'm good"".  The infuriating part is he could play DPOY on Friday against Boston with 37 points to go with it and you'll think that's what you want from him. But then he'll turn around on Sunday against Detroit with another half ass performance like this tonight getting his ass whooped by Kelly Olynyk. So many fast break opportunities where AD is just walking up the court. Ridiculous."
"Idk, Kelly Olynyk exists"
"He is. LeBron is the clear #2 and if he somehow matches Jordan in rings it’ll be very close. But to be fair.. this era has way more talented players. MJ was more dominant for his era but LeBron had way stiffer competition.   Kobe, Tim Duncan and the Spurs, KD and OKC, Celtics big 3, first run Warriors and then the KD Warriors. MJ never had to play against competition on that level, not to mention the Cavs arguably could’ve beaten the Warriors in 2015 if it wasn’t for Kelly Olynyk fucking up Love and then Kyrie getting hurt. He took that amazing team to 6 games with Dellavadova as his 2nd best, and then beat the same team (which set a regular season win record) the next year.   My issue with LeBron if anything is the formation of superteams, but it really ain’t his fault for being drafted by one of the most poorly run orgs in the NBA (and he still won them their first and only chip). Their total win record with and without him is *bad*."
All my homies hate Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk going Super Saiyan to win game 7 against Washington
Name him. It was dirty Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk lobs? We’re officially out of ideas.
"The more I watch of Kelly Olynyk, the more I miss Plumlee. The shooting is a nice bonus though."
kelly olynyk looks more like shaggy than shaggy does
Kelly  Olynyk still being in the NBA is white collar crime
Wade is a HoFer but he wasn't good in 2018. Bam was too young. DJJ had zero skill at that time. Whiteside had maybe the worst playoff series I've ever seen from a starter. Kelly Olynyk is skilled but was trying to be dirty at every opportunity. Dragic was dirty but is obviously a skilled player.
"I think a way to make it even more fun would be to allow free hard fouls on known dirty players.  Let players get their shots in on the Pat Bev, the Morris twins, Zaza, Dahntay Jones, Chris Paul, Delly, Kelly Olynyk, Draymond, and Grayson Allen type players once a game without punishment. I condone it."
Kelly Olynyk looks like he never showers
"I’ve been called a Lebron hater in the past but I 100% wanted Lebron to deck Kelly Olynyk after what he did to Kevin Love. I even shouted at the screen that I’d give LBJ a blowjob if it meant he’d slam Olynyk into the fucking stands. It doesn’t matter which team or player you support, hatred over dirty players come first and foremost for most nba fans"
"First of all I'm not sure about Haslem (though for sure he's only in games to be a retaliatory goon for years now) but PatBev has about a dozen high profile moments where he purposefully injures someone or tries to.   ""Nothing else"" is a bit of a stretch, but as Westbrook says “Pat Bev trick y’all, man, like he playing defense. He don’t guard nobody, man. He just running around, doing nothing.”  Secondly what a crazy thing to say. There are white guys and black guys who are cheap as hell in the NBA. Dirty players. The white guys who have done dirty shit just happen to be out of the league right now (like Brad Miller and Mike Dunleavy to name a couple) with the exception of Kelly ""The Arm Taker"" Olynyk and Grayson Allen. I don't know if either of them have had a dirty moment for a little while, unlike PatBev and the Morris Twins.   I played organized basketball. If you have, I very much doubt that you played at a high enough level where you have a guy who is just on the team to be dirty and physical. It's not normal. It's not even normal in the NBA.   So I don't know what you're on about as far as ""act like you've played"" when anyone who has played any sport knows that if someone does what Markieff does 99% of the time nothing happens because kids in middle school, high school, and college very rarely happen to want to fight. But things get stopped, the person will get ejected, people may get into a pushing match or just circle around the situation at hand, and on the rare occasion someone will retaliate. But in no basketball league on Earth is what Morris did not stopping the game and getting him thrown out. Especially at whatever level you played at once upon a time.  Then when you're in a league that has a camera rolling and you come to see the hit to Jokic's knee as well, Morris is looking at a much bigger problem than he was before in terms of suspension time. Especially considering he has a reputation among the league for doing stuff like this."
"Legit, and people are making it about race as if Kat did this to Kelly Olynyk the comments wouldn’t be full of shit talking about why Kelly is a dirty player.   Morris elbowed old mate in the ribs, it’s a grubby move and if you do grubby shit you have to be ready for a reaction."
Fuck Kelly Olynyk. Lunch lady looking motherfucker
"Kevin Love was certainly not a terrible fit on the Cavs. They were 1 Kelly Olynyk arm pull away from a ring and eventually won 1 with him playing elite defense in game 7. Sure, he wasn't 26 and 12 Kevin Love but to say he was a terrible fit is plain wrong."
Kevin Love was injured by Kelly Olynyk. It wasn't some random injury.
Send him to detroit for Kelly Olynyk and Cory Joesph
The Lakers got pushed to 6 games by Kelly Olynyk what is this dominant machine

Rocket legend Kelly Olynyk. Great times.
Kelly Olynyk
You mean Kelly Olynyk not Kelly Oubre lol.  I really havent watched many GSW games but did you mean Jordan Poole instead of Damion Lee?
The Kelly Olynyk special
other than Cade Cunningham and Jerami Grant (and occasionally Saddiq Bey and Kelly Olynyk) they don't have anyone else on the team with a scorer's mentality
Kelly Olynyk looks like a extra from Trailer Park Boys and I'm frankly here for it
Is Kelly Olynyk the greatest Piston of all time? People are starting to ask
"Kelly ""Steph 'Seth Curry' Curry"" Olynyk"
Kelly Olynyk has been the best piston so far in this horrible start and it only cost $13mil a year
Kelly olynyk type beat
Nah Kelly Olynyk is Lisa Kudrow
Kelly Olynyk. But Caruso is second.
Kelly Olynyk is the good version of Psycho T
"It was fun to say ""no expectations"" and ""let the young guys play"" but the results for the Pistons so far have been not great. Saddiq and Beef Stew have been solid, Trey Lyles has been a pleasant surprise, and Kelly Olynyk has been quite good, but the starters have been getting run off the floor and the offense is not good. Hopefully Cade playing will spice things up and at least make the team more interesting to watch"
I feel like whenever im watching Kelly olynyk he plays like a god
Kelly olynyk is a very aggressive basketball player
"Yo Boston is a lot of things. ""Wicked"" smart fan base. Good spread of wealthy and working class fans. Huge population. And literally you'd  need a barge to hold all their championship trophies in various sports. These fans have expectations and a classic northernbred lack of patience (I was born in PA, my moms from Philly, I know the types.) They expect a player to LIVE and DIE for Boston or go TF back home. Boston does attract a certain type of mentality that definitely exists (Boston was a Kelly Olynyk away from landing Giannis. Giannis would thrive in that culture, and his development track would probably still have yielded Tatum and Brown for the celts. Boston is known for this brand of Voodoo in all sports.) They've just got high expectations from a very long history of winning sports. Wanna blame someone? Blame the patriots. They just spent the last 2 decades turning Boston fans only humility into a damn juggernaut. You can't find a more sports driven city than Boston."
Gets himsef ejected when he’s 10/13 because of Kelly Olynyk? Wasted a near perfect game. Meanwhile Curry out here stat padding against tanking teams
And Houston willingly making the worst trade of the decade.   You get harden we get ~~Jarrett Allen~~  ~~Oladipo~~ ~~Kelly Olynyk~~
Nah Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk being our best offensive player unironically was bound to lead to this
i'm glad durant stood up for every good player that has been the victim of a dirty play Kelly Olynyk
"I really can't stand Kelly Olynyk. He even went to Gonzaga, the Duke of the West, which I bring up because dude acts an awful lot like the stereotypical Caucasian Duke big man: lots of dirty play (people call him ""awkward"" which I think is being a bit too nice) and if you were to take that away from him I'm not sure he's a starting quality NBA player.  I'm enjoying what Dwayne Casey is trying to do in Detroit and wish him luck. It just... ugh, sucks that Olynyk has to be a part of that."
"That dude was Kelly Olynyk though, so I think they should have let it go."
"Obligatory ""Fuck Kelly Olynyk"""
Honorary mention of Dallas and Boston swapping picks around Giannis so Boston would land Kelly Olynyk.

"fucm kelly sure but lets be honest what kelly did and kd did here is pretty much the same, olynyk just got lucky. he was legit elbowed in his neck"
"I would be shocked-SHOCKED, if Kevin Durant misses any time for shoving Kelly Olynyk."
"Ok people need to take into consideration who the foul is against. Kelly Olynyk is a massive bitch and I can imagine he did something to deserve this, if it was another player sure, but Kelly nah don't toss"
FUCK KELLY OLYNYK
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-HIsPKFWnI  Fuck Kelly Olynyk.
"I don't even watch Basketball, in fact I hate Basketball, but I clicked on this because Kelly Olynyk is one of the only basketball players I know of because he's from my city.   Off the court he's a [good dude.](https://cfjctoday.com/2016/07/20/kelly-olynyk-returns-to-kamloops-for-basketball-camp-2/) Just saying."
Yes they were bruh Christian wood and John Wall only played 81 combined games and the rest of the roster was dogshit except Kelly Olynyk who played like Larry bird for like 20 games
Oh yea he deserved getting tossed. That said Kelly Olynyk... Couldn't happen to a more worthy guy.
Pistons fan. I’m with this.  Fuck Kelly Olynyk for taking out Kevin’s arm.
Yea but kelly olynyk tho
"""Basketball fans, William Patrick Corgan here of the Fuck Kelly Olynyk Alliance, it's my honor and privilege to bring to you the OFFICIAL card for Halloween Night, 2021!""  Billy gonna have his fingers in as much random shit as Lebron soon enough.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot3ZDnsZcRg"
"As of this moment the Harden deal looks like this:  Houston gave away:  Harden  PJ Tucker  2021 2nd round pick  Houston got:  5 unprotected first round picks   4 unprotected pick swaps   1 protected pick swap   Kelly Olynyk  Avery Bradley  DJ Augustin  The maximum the Sixers could have offered in picks would have been 3 first round picks (2021, 2023, and 2027) and one pick swap pick (2022).  Would any team now trade 2 unprotected picks and 3 unprotected pick swaps (plus cap flexibility) for Simmons? Cause that's what the Rockets chose instead of Simmons (and Thybulle I guess)."
They got Kelly Olynyk instead who once took over a game 7 so yes.
"This sub always overreacts when a player has a bad series   Let’s not act like Simmons is suddenly a bum, same with Gobert   Obviously they must improve on their limitations that were exposed in the playoffs   But now you have people acting like the rockets were smart not to take Simmons in the harden trade, cuz getting Nets picks + Kelly Olynyk is so much better than Simmons and Maxey and 76ers picks"
Kelly Olynyk
"I know he had a very bad series but y’all are crazy lmao, getting him + Maxey + multiple firsts is much better than getting Kelly Olynyk and picks"
Houston would have traded him for Kelly olynyk and somehow come out on top lol
Almost as bad as Kelly olynyk ending your season
Huerter with his Kelly olynyk game
this reminds me of Kelly Olynyk
"don't remind me, the Celtics took Kelly Olynyk instead of Giannis.  Unlike Giannis, however, Booker was playing high visibility games on Kentucky with the #1 pick in the draft and shot better than 41% from 3 as a true freshman.  Giannis was 3"" shorter than he is today playing in a lower level European league"
"kelly olynyk doesn't seem possible, he was making $12M/yr on his last contract and is a UFA, gsw can't get FAs via S&amp;T because it's impossible for them to get below the hardcap, so they can only sign someone who wants the $5.9M MLE or min salary."
And the Cavs were a dumbass Kelly Olynyk and kyrie knee cap away from winning the first two of the those match ups.
"Warriors need a playmaker off the bench, a Jalen and they need to fill out the end of bench with shooters.  Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Wise/JTA/Poole/Looney should stay, thats 8/15.  For the PG spot, Steph obviously. Say we bring in a PG that runs the bench and can shoot decently, that's 9/15. A third string shooter PG to soak up minutes and shoot and nothing else makes 10/15.  For SG, Klay and Poole are locks and we can keep Lee because he's extremely close to Steph, he shoots, pretty clutch and it keeps chemistry flowing. 11/15  For SF, behind Wiggins should imo be Jalen Green. The most reasonable ways of drafting him are a) Getting the 4th pick from Minnie or b) Packaging 6th and 14th + an asset for the 4th. He fits us brilliantly and we get to get a young piece for the future while not overloading on rookies by drafting 2 rookies. 12/15 Behind Jalen Green should be Baze. He gets a lot of unfair hate as he was forced to have a massive role that he didn't sign up for after injuries ravaged us. He's hinted he wants to stay here, Steph and Dray love him and it's good for team chemistry. He shoots at a decent clip and is a great energy on defense. 13/15  For PF, we have Dray starting behind Dray would be JTA, a great gem we found who is perfect for us. I'd propose permanently shifting Looney to the bench 4. This season has showed that Looney + Dray is too weak spacing wise, they need to be apart.  For C, the starter would be Wiseman and off the bench would be Kelly Olynyk. Dude is made for us, I swear. A big man that can pass well and shoot nicely? We should really pursue him. 14/15. The final one would be some cheap C that can shoot when needed and nothing else. (If Chriss wants to re-sign with us, this would be him.) 15/15.  Put Nico on a 2 way or in the G-League, he has potential.  Overall, that's 5 new additions, no ridiculous superstar trade involved. Does this seem reasonable to you guys?"
they don’t if you’re up against kelly olynyk fml
Kelly Olynyk with his hairnet.
And fuck Kelly olynyk too
"Barea, Ingles, Kelly Olynyk, Spud Webb, Raymond Felton,  Darrick Martin"
"You wouldn’t play him higher than the 4 though. There’s too many skilled international bigs that are just gonna rise over him in the high post/top of the arc for 3. Like forget Jokic, a guy like Kelly Olynyk would give Zion work in international ball"
"It’s good in the backcourt and on the wing, but the bigs are dicey. Like, they’d have to live with some combination of Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell, and Chris Boucher. They’re not bad in an Olympic context, but compared to the US or Serbia they’ll have a tough time."
All I know is that Rockets Kelly Olynyk won a lot of people their fantasy leagues
anyway yeah fuck Kelly Olynyk
"I once picked up Kelly Olynyk trying to limp my way to my fantasy playoffs. Heat were the only team with a b2b to close out the week, and I just needed to guarantee winning rebounds. Literally any big man playing an average game would do. Olynyk having two games is just gravy.   Olynyk proceeds to get three rebounds total over those two games. I wound up watching most of the second one. It was just infuriating and made me convinced he could be an all-star if he tried harder and it together. He should be a lot better for how skilled he is but something's missing."
Fuck Kelly Olynyk
Up there with Kelly Olynyk Game 7
Bogdanovic reminds me of Miami Kelly Olynyk
Revenge for Kelly Olynyk!
"Rockets turned the Harden trade into LeVert + Fro, then Oldapio, then into an expiring Kelly Olynyk, a handful of beans, and draft picks. There's zero chance the Rockets wanted a max contract player on the books.  Frittata does not give a shit about winning, and his main businesses are taking a pounding during the pandemic."
You also don't want Simmons and Gordon on the floor together.  Best move for the Nuggets is to try to find another 3&amp;D wing and let MPJ continue to develop.  Also another mobile PF/C like Kelly Olynyk would be a good addition.
Kelly Olynyk and Kevin Love
lol this is what I'm thinking.  16th pick is a prime Kelly Olynyk or Fab Melo (RIP) spot.
"Lmao except instead you got an injured 2 guard who you traded for Kelly Olynyk (and the worst contract in the league from the WB trade), there’s really no way to say Simmons is worse than what you guys got.  It might be literally the worst trade in NBA history and you guys now have a roster almost as bad as the Process Sixers in addition to a completely incompetent FO so I wouldn’t be so high and mighty about not taking Simmo."
"Hell nah, LeBron has been shat on here since he joined the Lakers and the hate has only been getting worse since his ankle injury this year. They're anti clippers cuz of the trash talk they had last year and then choked against Denver and Playoff-P, and Nets because KD/Kyrie/Harden. Me personally, I like all pro ball players NBA or Euroleague, besides Pat Bev and Kelly Olynyk. Just wanna watch good ball."
"&gt;Wiggins led the Warriors in minutes, shots contested was 2nd in points, rebounds, blocks and steals and 3rd in assists.  You don't get that level of productivity for $15M.  If you did every team would jump on a player like that.  This isn’t a good thing. Wiggins as a teams best player is in the basement. Wiggins as a teams 3rd best player was still a lottery team last year. He’s a 4th/5th guy on a good team. That’s fine. But don’t conflate that with guys actually at the borderline all-star level. Anyone can pump up volume if you don’t actually care about results.   Kelly Olynyk did that for Houston, and he’s not getting 22-24m in the market."
Kelly Olynyk season
Probably means Kelly Olynyk is not re-signing with the Rockets.
Kelly Olynyk. Fuck Kelly Olynyk.
KD and Kelly Olynyk
"Based on NBA career alone, Kelly Olynyk. If were including college, Joakim Noah."
Kelly Olynyk &gt; Kelly Oubre
Then the second mask comes off and it’s Kelly Olynyk
Kelly “The Clinic” Olynyk was obviously not part of the “shitty vets” category. The man simply gets buckets
Kelly Olynyk was about 28x the NBA prospect Garza is
Kelly Olynyk gets minutes in the NBA.
You leave Kelly Olynyk out of that slander!
"Come on man. The Celtics picked Kelly Olynyk with Giannis still on the board. Jokic was drafted in the 2nd round. Nobody knew they would be MVP's when they were drafted. The Kings took Bagley with Doncic on the board. The international players are still a blind spot for most, if not all NBA GM's."
"People here legit think the only way to build a roster is 5 out 3&amp;D lineups with a PNR ballhandler, that's why they also think Kelly fucking Olynyk is somehow going to get like 20/year"
i used to look a tad like kelly olynyk but i had to cut my hair
A guy said I'm the same archetype as Kelly olynyk.... it was very offensive
"Kelly Olynyk. Fuck that guy, wish Oubre had gotten in a clean two piece on him."
The Rockets turned James Harden into Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley
"Why is Cristiano Felicio, who will absolutely be out of the league, Tier 4 while Bobby Portis, Kelly Olynyk etc are tier 5 lol  I’ll miss shrek"
Houston really chose Avery bradley and Kelly Olynyk who can both walk this offseason over Caris Levert and Jarett Allen lmao dumbass front office
Kelly Olynyk
**Kelly Olynyk**  SCREW YOU! PLAYING LIKE PRIME LARRY BIRD!
You're talking out of your ass if you think Kelly Olynyk and Christian Wood are good comparisons of value to Shai.
So you must think Kelly Olynyk is worth a top 3 lottery pick too: He put up 19/8/4 on 67% TS with Houston.  Christian Wood put up some insane numbers  too...are you giving up a top 3 pick for him as well?
"Idk this is kind of subjective. If we are talking most important draft picks, Ainge “reaching” for Jaylen Brown at 3, and then trading back to get Tatum, is significantly more important than missing on late first round picks. People really overrate the average value of picks outside of the top 5-10- Kelly Olynyk was a great pick, so was Rozier, Marcus Smart was a great pick (weak draft), Avery Bradley also a good find way back when.  All of that being said, no matter how you slice it, other teams overall have drafted better given circumstances. Toronto comes to mind off the top- all of those guys are home grown/ drafted. GSW has also done very well, Heat seem to find some diamonds in the rough, I’m sure others I’m forgetting."
I must say... scola got HOT after he lost the kelly olynyk hair lolol
"well, they did get a pick swap with BKN and Kelly olynyk, who was 29 at the time, which is younger than me. I say: no cap."
Fuck that kelly olynyk game
"Lopez was a horrible matchup for Bam and Spo seemed he didnt want Bam taking that midrange shot. Really got fucked when we traded Kelly Olynyk for Dipo, atleast if KO was on the court Lopez would have been pulled out from under the rim. Huge fucking gamble that didnt work out"
Kelly Olynyk at #13 playing like a #2 on the rockets
"I would absolutely love his fit alongside Bam and Jimmy. We’ve needed a floor spacing big who actually does other things and isn’t a complete defensive liability (see Kelly Olynyk). He’s a player that I don’t love giving the max, but we should hopefully be able to get some players back on team friendly deals and get cheap vets as always in FA so I wouldn’t mind it."
Kelly Olynyk would be our 3rd best player
2013 Redraft  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Rudy Gobert  3. CJ McCollum  4. Victor Oladipo  5. Steven Adams  6. Robert Covington  7. Otto Porter Jr.  8. KCP  9. Kelly Olynyk  10. Tim Hardaway Jr.
"This will be remembered as being on a level as the Kelly Olynyk game - Game 7, Second Round of the Eastern Playoffs in 2017.   Kelly O just Maple Dicked the Wizards just like Giannis Greek Dipped the Suns."
"How is that possible that he dont have money? Im not saying its not true but dont his teammate offer help? Or what about company car? Dont owners help their player? Its youre fault Ainge, you picked Kelly ""The Next Dirk"" Olynyk over this guy. Hooooooow"
Fuck Kelly olynyk
At least we got Kelly Olynyk Game 7 against the Wizards.....
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porziņģis / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Dončić / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schröder / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
"&gt; If AD wasn't short and allowed to play point, would he still be the player he is today?  Same thing with Kelly Olynyk. From an old scouting report on him:  &gt; Olynyk is quite a unique player considering his upbringing as a point guard. His guard skills mean he has very good ball handling ability (with both hands), so he is very good getting to the basket from the perimeter. From outside he shows beautiful touch on his jumper and has the potential to extend his range to three-point land... Olynyk grew up playing point guard until his junior year of high school, so he possesses elite instincts for a big man. Kelly has a lot of the intangibles that a point guard has when running the floor. He knows where to be and what the best passing lane is for the ball handler, putting himself in a perfect position for a pass.  https://www.celticsblog.com/2013/9/25/4768698/an-updated-in-depth-scouting-report-of-kelly-olynyk"
"Anecdotally, watching Lebron on defense involves watching a lot of someone who walks around with their palms up and doesn’t actually do a whole lot.   Advanced stats-wise, I know this doesn’t really mean anything but I think it’s hilarious that Lebron and Kelly Olynyk have identical DWS. DBPM is kinder. He’s definitely not useless and he is effective in spots, but there has been a massive dropoff over the past 5-6 years or so. He really does stand around a surprising amount, at least IMO.   Related to that: he moves slower on defense than [any forward in the league](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/speed-distance/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=AVG_SPEED&amp;dir=-1&amp;StarterBench=Starters&amp;PlayerPosition=F) (side note: I love player movement data). I don’t really think that says anything particularly concrete or damming, I just think it’s interesting to look at."
"The problem is that it doesn't selectively apply to any year, but is a recurring theme, so it needs to be discounted. There have been major injuries changing the playoff landscape in most recent years.   * 2020 Lakers - Bam, Jimmy, and Dragic all get injured in the first half of game 1.  * 2019 Raptors - Kevin Durant plays 12 minutes in the finals before his Achilles explodes. Klay Thompson misses time an eventually loses his ACL in game 6. Joel Embiid also has a mysterious illness in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals. * 2018 Warriors - Chris Paul's hamstring explodes in the Western Conference finals. * 2017 Warriors - The Warriors zaza Kawhi after getting blownout in game 1 of the WCF. * 2016 Cavs - Draymond gets suspended for caressing LeBron's testicle zone and Andrew Bogut breaks his leg. * 2015 Warriors - Kyrie Irving's knee cap breaks in game 1 of the finals and Kelly Olynyk breaks Kevin Love's shoulder. * 2014 Spurs - Our last real champions."
"Monty wasn’t considered top tier after his stint in New Orleans. Even Snyder was at risk of being fired as early as the start of this season if he didn’t perform.   Your roster matters a lot. Carlisle has kept the Mavs competitive when they had no right being so. Cuban broke up the 2011 Mavs team right after they won and has gone as far as saying that’s one of his biggest mistakes since owning the team.   I mean, just consider their first round drafts that followed their championship season:   In 2012, traded the 17th pick (Tyler zeller) for the 24th (Jared Cunningham), 33rd (Bernard James), and 34th (Jae Crowder).   Had no draft pick in 2013.   In 2014, traded the 13th pick (Kelly Olynyk) for Lucas Nogueira and two future seconds.   In 2015, drafted Justin anderson with the 21st pick. Anderson was traded two years later.   Had no 2016 pick.   In 2017, drafted Dennis Smith Jr. with the 9th pick. Was traded in 2019.   In 2018, they get Luka.   That’s a pretty shitty record sans Luka lol. You can’t expect to be much better than average when you’re drafting like that. A big part of why they were even competitive is because of Carlisle."
Kelly Olynyk is a sleeper shitty contract
Kyrie missed the 2015 finals and Kevin Love's arm was broken by Kelly Olynyk
Unironically Kelly Olynyk would be also really good next to Tatum.
"He wasn’t very hurt, he got grazed. And it’s clear it wasn’t malicious and wasn’t intentional. Not like jokic has a history of injuring guys like Kelly Olynyk or something"
Kelly Olynyk stole the Cavs title chances in 2015 and should be convicted for assault against Kevin Love.
"I'm still pissed about Kelly Olynyk ripping Kevin Love's arm out of it's socket. That cost us the 2015 championship, and Olynyk was a player.   No reason a player's bodyguard should be courtside. The teams provide security already."
shouldve been olynyk and shouldve been worse. kelly olynyk is a dirty fucking asshole
"The 13th pick is always an interesting one, too. Karl Malone (1985), Jalen Rose (1994), Kobe (1996), Zach LaVine (2014), Devin Booker (2015), and Donovan Mitchell (2017).   Also some recent guys with decent careers so far, from Ed Davis (2010) to Markieff Morris (2011) to Kelly Olynyk (2013) to Tyler Herro (2019).  Fair share of duds though, with Papagiannis (2016), Kendall Marshall (2012), Jerome Robinson (2018), and most of the 2000s picks save Richard Jefferson and Thabo."
"Kelly Olynyk going from Miami to Houston, as a heat fan for years in was praying for him to get traded bc he just didn't fit, then he did and balled for Houston at the end of the season"
Every tanking team has a guy who puts up crazy numbers. Kelly Olynyk was dropping a 20/8 for Rockets on 67% TS.
Kelly Olynyk put up 19/8 on 67% TS with the Rockets this year while he averaged 10ppg with the Heat.    Those numbers don’t translate to playoff teams.
I disagree. Woods has never had a healthy season. Has only put up numbers for tanking teams.  Doesn’t play defense.   I mean Kelly Olynyk put up 19/8/4 for Houston this year.  Are you trying to give up a lottery pick for Olynyk because those are insane numbers for a stretch 5
"Yeah a lot of what you're saying is true--that's why I had to remove context. Although I would add that ""a strong Lakers defensive squad"" also literally describes the 2020 Finals--Jimmy was being guarded by LeBron, with AD as an elite rim protector.   And, while this is certainly nuanced, I think that part of the reason that Jimmy seemed to have more help was his playmaking and distribution. Guys like Duncan Robinson and Jae Crowder weren't creating their own offense; the team offense ran on catch-and-shoot and Jimmy had to facilitate all of that with Dragic out and no other true PG.  And that's not even mentioning the defensive load. Jimmy was the primary defender on, again, LeBron, with basically no help with rim protection (Kelly Olynyk and an injured 22-year-old Bam to stop AD). AI had the DPOY.  In sum, the point of this comparison is to see who had the most unimpeachable defense against being told they have no championships because of poor finals performances. Iverson could have facilitated better and gotten better looks. I don't think Jimmy could have left anything more out on the floor."
Etwaun Moore Kelly Olynyk Avery Bradley  Rajon Rondo Al Jefferson Tony Allen
"22ppg for the worst team in the East. You can give any role player insane usage and he'll inflate his PPG stats. That doesn't mean he'll contribute to winning basketball. Kelly fucking Olynyk was able to inflate his stats  Vucevic literally was putting 24ppg and got moved for....2 ""measley"" 1sts. The Magic got lucky that the Bulls were worse than they expected to be because Lavine was out most of the 2nd half of the season. During the trade that was expected to be a late teens pick &gt;The trade is god fucking awful.  You clearly have a barometer thats off"
This dude is just an European 3 inches taller version of kelly olynyk lmao
Kelly olynyk
"&gt; For the Los Angeles Lakers, you get a ""third star"".  KP is so very far from a star...  He's more like an overhyped ""rich mans"" Kelly Olynyk on a godawful contract who can't stay healthy."
"Perhaps he can be used more effectively, but then you still have to deal with the fact that he can't stay healthy, his contract sucks, and his defense is bad.  Just go sign Kelly Olynyk for 1/3 of the price this offseason."
Kelly Olynyk + 4 1st round picks and 5 pick swaps&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Simmons + whatever draft capital Philly offered  Not to mention that Houston now has a 52% chance of keeping their (top 4 protected) pick due to having the worst record in the league this season.
"Well obviously they’d rather have kept Harden, but they didn’t get complete dogshit like Victor Oladipo, who just turned into Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley. It was an awful take, and I personally think it was slightly worse than the take OKC got."
"Yep, who would want him when you get to end up Kelly Olynyk!!!"
Because homie thinks it's unrealistic for a team to be compensated for facilitating a S&amp;T.  That's just normal business.  The unrealistic part is Brooklyn trading to get Kelly Olynyk.
Kelly olynyk
You misspelled Kelly Olynyk.
"That sounds pretty specific.   You can be tired of someone's yapping while also respecting them as a great player and competitor. Plus, no player (other than Kelly Olynyk and maybe CP3) wants to see another player get inured."
"If a team really pays Kelly Olynyk for his post-trade deadline production on the actively tanking Rockets, they're in for a rude awakening (it's gonna be us, isn't it)"
Lol it’s Kelly olynyk
"He channeled his inner Kelly olynyk, duh"
"Well instead they got Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk, a bunch of middle schoolers and some shitty swaps they don’t even have full control over."
"&gt; ""Y’all beat an injured team""   One dude was injured lol.  &gt; Yea but you put Cousins like he was a decent player and he was barely a factor.  Nah he was just putting up a 16 ppg, 8 rpg, 3.5 apg, 1.5 bpg and 1 spg season. Not a threat at all! /s  &gt; but if Lakers ring doesn’t count, neither does Toronto’s  Lakers ring doesn't count. Only up against Butler and Bam who were All Stars for most of that series. We're talking two All-Stars versus two all time great players. Then they had to deal with a rookie starter (LOL), G-League 3rd Team Duncan Robinson (LMAO), an average player like Jae Crowder and third stringer Kelly Olynyk. Oh no! Very comparable to Curry, Green, Thompson, Cousins and Iguodala. /s"
Couldn't get the best out of superstar Kelly Olynyk though
Kelly olynyk got 50 mil for getting hot one game 7
The HEAT were missing  ~~Victor Oladipo~~ **Kelly Olynyk**
Kelly Olynyk going back to his Boston days. Looks like LeBron whenever I watch him.
Look on the bright side of getting your season ended by Seth Curry at least it wasnt Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk?
"Pritchard, Grayson Allen, Tatum, Meyers Leonard, and Kelly Olynyk"
"Kelly Olynyk for Tatum? Who’s says no? many people are saying it’s an amazing trade for the Celtics, many people..."
His 3rd year as coach they were a 5 seed at 48-34  His best players on that roster were:  \- Isiah Thomas (defensive sieve)  \- Avery Bradley  \- Jae Crowder  \- Evan Turner  \- Jared Sullinger  and Kelly Olynyk.  That would not be a playoff team with most coaches.
"Better than a deal centered around nothing, which got turned into a deal centered around Oladipo, who eventually turned into....wait for it....Kelly Olynyk. Harden was traded for package centered around Kelly The Accountant Olynyk."
"Chill bro it’s not that serious just take your L and move on  Edit also the 1986 Knicks were the bottom seed and had rookie Patrick Ewing, Bill Cartwright and Bernard King.  They would shit on Kelly Olynyk KPJ and the rest of the bums on the Rockets rn lmao."
Morey furiously trying to find a loop hole to sign Kelly Olynyk in the middle of the playoffs.
FUCK KELLY OLYNYK
Harden really is the best net player. The rockets really let him go for Kelly olynyk and 4 late rounders
Throw in some players who will collectively get flipped for Kelly olynyk and Dante exum and it’s a done deal
"it's extremely close to the same team. Jae Crowder isn't an elite 3 pt shooter. He got hot last year and then cooled off dramatically. I'm sorry the Heat's run to the finals was based on the elite play of Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynyk and Derrick Jones Jr.  I guess if those were your most important players your team should've kept them. The truth is the Bucks just exposed the Heat and spanked em raw. And those three guys weren't changing that"
"Healthy Timelord is the perfect complimentary piece the Jays need. He defends, he is efficient, and he moves the ball.   Basically the C's need those 3 things in a player. Cheap examples of this could be guys like Mason Plumlee, Royce O'Neal, Jae Crowder, or Kelly Olynyk."
only 4 years ago the Wizards were in the 2nd round and took the Celtics to game 7.  They were a Kelly Olynyk explosion away from being in the Conference Finals.
Kelly Olynyk &amp; Jae Crowder were two big losses and also Iggy’s washed
"the refs get paid a lot of money to use their discretion. I get what you’re saying from a pure competitive standpoint, but player safety has to be considered. plays like this just don’t have a place in the game.   remember that play when kelly olynyk fucked up kevin love’s shoulder in the playoffs? since then, refs in the nba, fiba and college started sniffing out any play that looked even close to a hook and hold and handed out flagrants like candy. that type of foul used to happen a lot but the reason you don’t see it much anymore is because of how dangerous it is. same with this kind of horse collar foul. refs shouldn’t have to wait until someone gets seriously hurt before they take action to remove this type of foul from the game"
literally as long as your rim protector isn't Enes Kanter or Kelly Olynyk you can pretty easily hide a bad defensive guard
Kelly Olynyk
"They were coming off their best season in years, were a Kelly Olynyk away from the ECF, and already lost Bojan to FA. They had to match whatever offer OPJ got in FA because they couldn’t afford to lose him. They got rid of his contract pretty easily tho."
"Oh shit, hi Kelly Olynyk"
He's no Kelly Olynyk.
Always nice seeing Gobert pulling on Valanciunas arm like he was Kelly Olynyk to get the rebounds. Refs treat Gobert like he's somekind of a french crybab-....oh.
Myles Leonard and Kelly Olynyk
Kelly olynyk
A stretch 4 like Kelly Olynyk.
Respect to Jae Crowder and Kelly Olynyk
"Yeah, replace Jae Crowder, Derrick Jones Junior, and Kelly Olynyk with just 35 year old Trevor Ariza. That’s a significant roster downgrade. Especially when the other team did the exact opposite, signed 3 key players Holiday, Tucker, Portis. A significant roster upgrade."
"Excuse me, without Kelly Olynyk this team is a shell of its former self. And who could forget Meyers Leonard to rile up the Locker room with a ""Jews will not replace us"" chant."
What no Kelly olynyk does to a mfer
"C’mon, how were they supposed to get one of those.  Not everyone can have Kelly Olynyk on their team..."
"They retained most of the players. I think the only significant losses were Jae Crowder and Kelly Olynyk. Y'all got Ariza which would seem to make up for the loss of Crowder. Now if Olynyk was still there, they'd probably still lose, just probably not get swept."
Uhh Kelly Olynyk on Kevin Love ring a bell?
Thank you for The GOAT Kelly Olynyk and taking oladipo off our hands doe
"Real ""Kelly Olynyk pulling people's arms out of their sockets"", vibes."
At least Kelly Olynyk was good for something   What a clown
Kelly olynyk made that move a key part of heat culture lmao
Tried to pull a Kelly olynyk get him the fuck out
Why are the heat so shit? One reason and one reason only: Kelly Olynyk
Kelly olynyk is a god
"Yeah, KP is in the tier of “serious 3 point threats”, not just “bigs who can make wide open 3s”.  The spacing from someone like KP is a lot more significant than spacing from a big like Kelly Olynyk or Dewayne Dedmon. KP’s a good enough shooter that his defender is a lot less likely to help off of him, which helps the rest of the team even if KP never touches the ball. Most stretch-5s don’t actually provide that much spacing because you can help off of them and live off of the one 3 they make per game"
The disrespect to name the inferior Kelly but not Kelly Olynyk
the Rockets really gave this man up for Kelly Olynyk and picks
Dude Porzingis is 7’3. Like this dude should be a cheat code on offense and he’s just Kelly olynyk.
That Blake Griffin or Kelly Olynyk? Dirty ass move.
Yeah maybe they can get Kelly Olynyk for him
In the playoffs would you rather have Kelly Olynyk or Randle?
"Among those who accepted the camp invitations: Golden State’s Andrew Wiggins, New York’s RJ Barrett, Memphis’ Dillon Brooks, Oklahoma City’s Luguentz Dort, Houston’s Kelly Olynyk, New Orleans’ Nickeil Walker-Alexander, and Indiana’s Oshae Brissett.  For some, like Barrett and Brooks, availability will obviously hinge on how far their teams advance in the NBA playoffs.  “There is no greater feeling in sports than the chance to represent your country on the highest international stage at the Olympic Games,” Canada senior men’s program general manager Rowan Barrett said. “Our players and staff fully recognize the unique opportunity that lies ahead of us and I would like to commend them for their dedication to playing for Canada this summer.”     Let's go"
I remember one year we had to throw kelly olynyk at him.  Poor Kelly I wasn't even mad
"Jesus christ im done with this.   You're either deliberately trolling or genuinely know nothing about the subject.  Robinson and Nunn having played in the G league does not mean we'd be able to replace their value with another G league player. Iggy is still good for the Heat in his role, and yeah, Precious is the worst player of the trade but he's still a decent young asset. There's also Tyler Herro and Kelly Olynyk.  Having actual NBA quality players on your roster is important, having a team stacked at the top supported by trash isnt winning anything.   This is my last comment in reply to you"
Short answer is no. If you're good enough to play in the NBA you're not playing OUA ball in Canada.   Good players are scouted way earlier out of prep programs like the Athlete Institute in Mono or that Alma Academy in Montreal that found Dort and Boucher. The last player that I know of that even played 4 years of high school ball up here and made the league is Kelly Olynyk.
Kelly olynyk lol
okay so the difference in a first round sweep and a finals run is Jae AND Kelly Olynyk.
"Holiday is a huge difference maker, Bud has made some significant adjustments since last year, and Miami doesn’t have Jae “Super Sized Curry” Crowder or Kelly “Larry Bird” Olynyk anymore."
They could use a guy by the name of Kelly Olynyk
How can you forget the legendary Myers Leonard and Kelly Olynyk?
Heat really flaming out without rebound god kelly olynyk
Who knew kelly olynyk was the most important heat last year.
Did Rockets fleece the Heat lol?  Kelly Olynyk would’ve dropped 30 on these bucks
Bucks lost an Eric Bledsoe and gained a Jrue Holiday.   Heat lost Jae Crowder and traded Kelly Olynyk for a Victor Oladipo with paper legs.
* The rest of the conference got better. * They lost high level role players in Kelly Olynyk and Jae Crowder. * Goran Dragic declined because of old age/his finals injury. * Iguodala declined because of old age. * Tyler Herro declined because he didn't work on his game/body properly this summer. * Bam? * Budenholzer finally realized he could put Giannis on Butler.   They had a +3.0 net rating last year (7th in the league) and a -0.2 net rating this season (16th in the league). This team just isn't that good outside of Jimmy/Bam/Robinson.
I miss 7'0 Larry Bird known as Kelly Olynyk
If Luka isn’t jacking up threes then wtf is his use? Lol his future in the league is being a Kelly Olynyk type
Oh you mean the same Kelly Olynyk that blatantly fucked up Kevin Love's arm?
And then Kelly Olynyk happened
I get:  1. LeBron 2. Kareem 3. Russ 4. Hakeem 5. Wilt 6. MJ 7. Vucevic 8. Bill Russell 9. Drummond 10. Brook Lopez 11. Valanciunas 12. DeMarcus Cousins 13. Tim Duncan 14. Kobe 15. Horford 16. Myles Turner 17. Marc Gasol 18. DeAndre Jordan 19. Steven Adams 20. Giannis 21. Pau 22. Kanter 23. Nurkic 24. Robin Lopez 25. LaMarcus Aldridge 26. McGee 27. Rose 28. Ibaka 29. Kidd 30. Steph 31. Dwight Howard 32. Shaq 33. Blake Griffin 34. KD 35. Kevin Love 36. Kelly Olynyk 37. Dame 38. AD 39. LaVine 40. Jokic 41. CP3 42. Pippen 43. Barkley  Very big-heavy. Something like 3/4 are bigs.
How dare jimmy butler not beat AD/Lebron with Kelly Olynyk and Solomon Hill. What a fucking scrub
One Kelly Olynyk away from the ECF man
He Kelly Olynyk clumsy?
"It's just not right. He played such a key role in the Celtics rebuild, had one and a half amazing offensive seasons and really brought the fans back after Pierce, KG, and Ray Allen were gone. It was almost like our version of Linsanity.   What Kevin Love incident? Are you thinking of Kelly Olynyk?"
"This feels like a fake rumor to get the Pistons to give up actual assets in return for him, try to get their bizarre front office to panic that he may go to LA or Miami instead.  I have no sense still if they would fall for that or not - I feel like Kelly Olynyk was a massive overpay and the DJ trade made no sense, but then I also thought Grant was a terrible contract who is thus far proving he can be a star. Really have no idea what that team is doing"
"You know they had a shot at drafting him but picked Kelly Olynyk. They could've done it. They didn't so I don't buy them saying ""oh we were 100% going to if Cuban would've just been more ok with spending"". Seems like Nelson liked the prospect but not enough to actually go out there and fight to draft him. I guess you can somehow believe the Mavs would've drafted him despite the Mavs passing on him if you want to."
I read this as Kelly Olynyk at first lol I'm a bit disappointed now
They went to 6 games with a team of Jimmy/nunn/crowder/Duncan Robinson/kelly olynyk….with a healthy dragic and bam they definitely had a chance
Kelly Olynyk made a lot of money because of that game 7 against the Wizards
Fuck Kelly Olynyk
Fuck kelly olynyk *bronsexual btw*
Kelly Olynyk. 2017. Game 7
"First round exit in 4. This isn't the 1990s, you need 4 shooters on a team 90% of the time. This has 0.5 shooters. Replace Thybulle with Seth Curry and Gobert with like Kelly Olynyk and it's a better hypothetical imo."
*Kelly Olynyk has entered the chat.*
Kelly olynyk ripped his arm out of the socket. Fucking  piece of shit. Ruined the whole season
"The bad boy pistons have built this aura of insane aggression. Like no, that was exception where a team literally couldn’t stop the GOAT so they resorted to beating the shit out of him in a series or two. I watched Kelly Olynyk rip Kevin Love’s shoulder out and then Kendrick Perkins and JR Smith literally committed battery on Jae Crowder as revenge. It’s really not different other than a couple rule changes."
"I’ll cast my vote for the Rockets, if we’re counting the draft. A team that was incredibly awful last year, setting one of the longest losing streaks in league history, re-tooled with four supremely exciting rookies in Jalen Green, Alpheren Sengun, Josh Christopher, and Usman Garuba. Considering how the Rockets were the league’s most moribund team after the Harden trade, with a core of Kelly Olynyk and washed Wall, to have one of the league’s best young cores (those four + KPJ + Tate) less than a year later actually gives Rockets fans some hope for the future."
What about Kelly Olynyk dislocating K-Loves shoulder?
"Lonzo Ball  Norman Powell   LeBron James  Kyle Anderson   Kelly Olynyk   Bench: Satoransky, Nance Jr, Garrison Matthews   I think they could beat a lot of championship teams but idk about the Warriors. If you add Embiid though, different story."
"At least whoever they get back for Simmons won’t be as bad as Harden for Kelly olynyk, Avery Bradley and picks"
doesnt change the fact they traded Harden for 27 games of Kelly Olynyk and some late draft picks
"Well if the 21 Bucks swept the Heat, tells you a lot doesn't it? Or are you gonna say Kelly Olynyk was responsible for that run"
A certain GM gave up James Harden for 27 games of Kelly Olynyk and some late draft picks
He may as well be 6’1 with no ball handling ability for the way he plays. That’s the problem with this contract.   Kelly Olynyk does basically everything better across the board and he’s cheaper.   This was a pure potential play - they’re hoping for Lauri to realize how much better be should be. If he reaches that potential it’s a steal. As it is it’s an awful contract.
Kelly “Maple Dick” Olynyk for sure
"ideally-   a true lead playmaking point guard that can shoot. i.e Kyle Lowry   wings- one wing that can shot create and shoot, one wing that is a good catch and shoot threat on volume. i.e: Zach Lavine and Bojan Bogdanovic   center- kristaps porzingis or (if we’re trying to make the cap work) jaren jackson jr. dario saric or kelly olynyk off the bench.   that gives him ample spacing, competent defense and other guys that can shoulder on ball creation loads. don’t think that’s like a tile team but that team would “maximize” ben simmons.  they would struggle on the boards"
Kelly Olynyk is a future All-Star
"Kelly Olynyk before his growth spurt. Shooter who passes up shots because I lack confidence, can playmake when I somehow get downhill, and good defensive positioning until I’m overwhelmed by better athletes. Oh, and gross long hair nobody tells me is ugly to my face but I like anyways."
Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk too
I would say he's not even top 10 he's close though  No particular order   Paul George  Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant  Lebron  Russ  Pat Bev  Ben Simmons  James Harden  Kyrie(maybe? not 100% on this one)  Draymond  Chris Paul      Honorable Mentions    Kelly Olynyk  Rudy Gobert  Grayson Allen  Devin Booker  Kyle Kuzma
"In hindsight all those trades are godawful, I’m not denying that. But Harden with the Rockets was in his prime, fresh off of however many consecutive first team all-NBA appearances and top 3 MVP finishes, and they traded him for KPJ, Victor Oladipo (who they’d later flip for Avery Bradley and Kelly fucking Olynyk), and some future picks that will all be late first rounders most likely.   Kobe, Pippen, and so one were all rookies that hadn’t been drafted yet, so there was no guarantee how good they’d be. Everyone knew how good Harden is, and they still traded him for chump change, then somehow made their take even worse."
Yea but he's no Kelly Olynyk...🤬
"Dellavedova also went to hospital after game 3 because he had completely exhausted himself, and never was the same. Obviously it’s all hypotheticals but I believe that with Love on the court we would’ve had the offense and could’ve taken enough pressure of off Delly and the rest of our starting lineup to score. I think he would’ve swung the series.  Fuck Kelly Olynyk"
Can't believe the Heat gave away Kelly Olynyk for nothing.
We have Kelly Olynyk and the Wolves do not have Kelly Olynyk
"Yeah the package they got is sooo much better, Kelly Olynyk!"
Rockets got Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk for Harden
yeah avery bradley and kelly olynyk are a deadly two-man combo and will be for years
The Heat are filled with players you want to root for because they just grind under the radar. Except Kelly Olynyk. I just despise him all the time.
"RJ Barrett, Chris Boucher, Kelly Olynyk, Corey Joseph, Tristan Thompson, Jamal Murray"
Haha right? Kelly Olynyk and Duncan Robinson should probably get it done. I’d worry the Heat would give up too much though for just a random plug and play center like Towns.
"&gt;I love Kelly O but KAT would be a great plug and play option for Kelly’s minutes in the rotation.  Lol. Just a casual ""plug and play"" upgrade over Kelly Olynyk in the rotation is all KAT is"
Also agree. Them 2 and Kelly Olynyk are pure elegance.
Kelly Olynyk has really been holding down the paint this year
"As a heat fan, We rely on Jimmy too much, If Bam develops a shot , and our younger guys like Herro, Nunn, and Achiuwa keep developing we would be in a much better spot. While we're on the topic, if we got better big defenders it would also help astronomically, like Why is Kelly Olynyk still on our roster, and the fact that we have him and Meyers leonard who is pretty much him but worse is stupid.  They space the floor, but aren't great at it, and the amount of layups i've seen Olynyk miss is insane. A guy like Robert Covington would be so much better, similar to Jae Crowder last year; has good defense and can knock down a 3. The height advantage by Leonard and Olynyk is pretty much useless because they are worse perimeter defenders in a 3 point/perimeter oriented league."
"Celtics could've had a core of Brown/Tatum/Giannis if they drafted Giannis instead of Kelly Olynyk, you can do this for every team"
"Boston could have had a core of Smart, Brown, Tatum, Giannis, Jokic if they had drafted Giannis and Jokic instead of Kelly Olynyk and James Young  you can do this stuff with any team"
Wow he one time almost made the Eastern Conference Finals if it wasn't for Kelly Olynyk. When you put it that way this guy sure has had a hell of a career.
I hate being an Olynyk sympathizer but he 100% would start over Aldridge  Kelly is honestly a really good team defender and Aldridge being slow as hell would only hurt the defense  If anything it would be nice to have someone who can create their own shot off the bench so we stop blowing leads whenever Jimmy sits (tbh I don't know if Aldridge is still that effective at creating his own shot but at least he provides offense unlike Iggy/KZ most of the time)
1. Goran Dragic (All Star (sub-in) like 2 seasons ago) 2. James Harden (MVP and multiple NBA scoring leader) 3. Jimmy Butler (Averaged 26.2pts in his only Finals appearance to date) 4. Kelly Olynyk ( 3&amp;D player (needs work on both tho) ) 5. Bam Adebayo (last year All-Star whose young with a very high ceiling IMO)     Pretty decent starting squad but they definitely lose their depth in the process. Not so sure it would've been worth it.
Kelly Olynyk has been playing very well.
"hahaha, what a goofball!!! him, Kelly Olynyk and Marcus Smart I think are the funniest NBA players going right now with some honorable mentions I have no time to write out lol!!"
"If he means BC, Kelly Olynyk and Rob Sacre."
Kelly Olynyk in game 7. wizards fans remember
"Bam has already missed 6 games (those games Jimmy played) Tyler 12 games, Dragic 14 games, Bradley 28 games, Meyers Leonard 35 games, etc. This team has been anything but healthy, so no the argument that Jimmy has more help is wrong when you see dudes like KZ Opala and Kelly Olynyk getting heavy minutes. We’re a middling team record-wise because of how hard COVID and injuries have hit us so far but it’s clear that with Jimmy we’re a really nice team that can play (and beat) anyone, this is not even a luke-warm take. In terms of the top 3, only the Nets would be clear-cut favorites against us in a 7 game series, and that’s because they’re insanely talented."

Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk is pretty up there
Which type of Kelly Olynyk are we getting tonight
"I say this as Kelly Olynyk's biggest hater ever: He did the same thing to Love that Love did to him on the play just before the one where Love got injured. Kelly didn't get injured, Love did.  Olynyk retaliated, he didn't randomly decide to tug a dude's arm out of its socket. He was many things, angry psycho is not one of them."
Smart has literally never injured anyone. He's not Kelly Olynyk. He flops but he's not dirty.
Kelly Olynyk left before he could finish Smarts training unfortunately.
Thats basically Kelly Olynyk who is currently starting lol
Let’s be real I’ve said a lot of shit about LA this year but if you had the choice to give him the ball to get a bucket when your bench can’t score in the playoffs or... Kelly Olynyk the choice is clear.
"1 Meyers Leonard and Kelly Olynyk please, not even long term money"
Our only non Bam bigs are rookie Precious and Kelly Olynyk. He'd be a great addition.
"Yeah Olynyk is basically Meyers who offers exactly the same things, and if Meyers gets barely any minutes as opposed to Kelly we can assume how unplayable he is"
Why not Meyers Leonard (to be waived by SAS) and Kelly Olynyk for Aldridge?
Kelly Olynyk is just 3 kids in a trench coat
"You guys had a very strong end to the half, strong enough that I think it proves you guys can make a deep playoff run again. Really you just need a better starting 4 than Kelly Olynyk"
"Poor man’s Kelly Olynyk, team option contract, AND Heat owner is Israeli? That boy gone"
"I'm not saying he should lose his career. But he's a pretty bad player who just yelled an ethnic slur on video, so this might be it for him. If he was even as good as, to use an example, Kelly Olynyk, then this wouldn't be the end for him. Dude's 29 and in his 9th year, the best-case scenario before this was bouncing around the league as a deep bench guy for the next 3-5 years."
Kelly Olynyk is no longer the most hated 7 foot white player on the Miami Heat
Fuck Kelly Olynyk with a broomstick
Yeah Kelly olynyk is a fucking asshole. He hooked Kevin love’s arm and deathrolled it right out of it’s socket. Dude Shoudlve been suspended for half a season. There should be a no tolerance policy for purposely hurting someone and causing a major injury.
[Kelly Olynyk with the armlock from hell](https://youtu.be/ZZ31539Cg04)
"Oh I used to be a big fan of his but the way he's been playing has been pretty sad. People says it's effort or hustle but most of the time it just seems dirty. I know your pain though, at the beginning of this very session I was cheering for Kelly Olynyk who has thrown actual grappling moves."
Fuck kelly olynyk
"He played a few games for us and i hated every minute of it. Excellent energy and hustle but he's kinda reckless. I pretty much never trusted him to make the right play. Reminded me of a worse version of kelly olynyk because the second he came on the floor the game felt more dangerous.  That being said, he has the tools to get better. There's obviously potential with a high motor big man who can shoot. He seems to have the drive, not a bad guy to take a chance on for a rebuilding team."
Just for this im telling the voters to vote for Kelly Olynyk
"The Brampton legend bro low key you were kinda disrespectful but it's cool. Honestly I think Brandon Clarke, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Chris Boucher, and Khem Birch is a solid front court. Olynyk game is much better suited for international basketball, and I'm excited to see how Boucher performs in that setting too. You'd think his insane blocking ability will reak havoc on less talented role players on some of these international teams.    Dillon Brooks at 6'7 can also slide over to the 4 spot even though he seems to be allergic to rebounding."
"Unfortunately this is true, as Kelly Olynyk has more skill than run and dunk man Giannis."
What about Kelly Olynyk - Maple Dick?
The 14-15 Cavs team was better and you guys got lucky that our players all died in the playoffs (fuck Kelly Olynyk).  That's not to take way from you guys: you were crazy good! That was a great rivalry until you guys got Durant and ruined basketball.
kelly olynyk game 7?

Wtf how do you let Kelly Olynyk get 11 assists
"Never said he was, just saying that you are reaching if you think he's dirty. You sound like the people who were shitting on Solomon Hill for unintentionally injuring Bron. Players are dirty when it's a pattern. Kelly Olynyk fucked up Kevin Love's arm, but he also tried it on Kawhi before. Clearly a dirty player. Kyle? You stretching hella hard"
Kelly Olynyk dropping 50 tonight
Come coach a team with Championship aspirations!  Sike! Here's the corpse of John Wall and Kelly Olynyk
you forgot to trade levert for oladipo and ??? and then trade oladipo for kelly olynyk and someone else i don't recall
"giving simmons an average center would make the spacing even worse, unless you mean like, kelly olynyk or something. giving embiid an average point guard would probably give the team a point guard capable of actually running a pick and roll correctly. and embiid is the far better player. delete this"
&gt;Kelly Olynyk  &gt;pull  you lil shit
I had faith in Kelly Olynyk to pull us through.
Sucks but at least we got Kelly Olynyk now so I can rest easy knowing I’ll never see this reposted ever again
Kelly Olynyk uglier
KELLY OLYNYK. He's number one!!!
I honestly forgot Kelly Olynyk existed but apparently he’s been having a good season so there’s that too
"They came out of that trade with Kelly Olynyk lol. Going the OKC route with the rebuild, just stocking up on picks."
Grayson Allen    Kelly Olynyk    Zaza Pachulia     Draymond Green    Meyers Leonard
Kelly Olynyk
"&gt;Houston didn’t have leverage but we’re still able to get a huge return  Houston definity didn't get a great return. What is it now, Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley, and 12 8th Graders?"
"Moves made that aren't directly part of the trade shouldn't be discussed in what Houston ""got"" for James Harden.  Kelly Olynyk was part of the James Harden trade because he was a direct result of Oladipo who originated from the Harden trade. Porter Jr wasn't. This year's draft pick wasn't."
Kelly Olynyk and a bunch of middle schoolers is still an awful return. No way the Nets will just hand the Rockets another Tatum or Brown on a silver platter either.
"Are we comparing Nikola Vucevic vs Bam Adebayo? Or are we comparing Kelly Olynyk vs Nerlens Noel?  I think in most cases, you take the defensively versatile big because that's easier to build around. But in some cases (teams like the Bucks or Lakers), the stretch big might be the better option."
I'm hoping they go after Kelly Olynyk.

Kelly Olynyk revenge game incoming
Fuck Kelly Olynyk
Lol I Was gonna say Schroeder for his dirty moves on John Wall. But Kelly Olynyk takes the cake !
Fuck Kelly Olynyk
Also Kelly Olynyk for tearing Kevin Love’s shoulder out and making him miss the 2015 finals.
Kelly Olynyk
Kelly olynyk is the perfect Celtic. Trash
Kelly Olynyk is what Myles Leonard thinks he is
"&gt;Worry about your own team, isn’t your best player Kelly Olynyk?  This is so corny lmao. It's a flair, calm down.   I'm not anti Westbrook or anything, I'm just saying the attitude change doesn't really matter if they aren't good"

"Jesus Christ. It's painful watching the dude play. He is clearly playing with a chip on his shoulder and although that can be a good thing for some people, it's clearly not an option for Wall. Dude needs to stop forcing things.   At Least you have your next star, Kelly Olynyk"
Well this entire subreddit can’t see the future can it? Obviously Kelly Olynyk isn’t good enough for fucking James Harden. Just disingenuous to argue that their current unknown return is garbage just because it’s not in front of you. That’s a child’s argument.
Dragic i'll give you but Crowder came in pretty much at the latter half of the season and Herro is a rookie. That team had no business making the finals. Then Jimmy took 2 games off of a fully healthy lakers squad with Duncan Robinson and Kelly Olynyk as his next 2 best players.
Kelly Olynyk  I saw Pacers fans say fuck olynyk on their sub and I was like “wtf did he do to them lmao”
"&gt;Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...? Man   You just listed quite a few terrific players. Would be by far the best best in the league"
"Starting 5: D'Angelo Russell / Anthony Edwards / Jerami Grant / Christian Wood / Karl-Anthony Towns. That's pretty clear-cut unless you're not sold on Edwards yet, then maybe you go Beasley/Ross/Harris?  Then you have Wall and Beasley off the bench, and things really fall off. Who's next? Kevin Porter, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk, Mason Plumlee, Eric Gordon, Gary Harris, Otto Porter, Saddiq Bey, Wendell Carter...?  Man this list got ugly quick."
No I meant it sucks Olynyk is y’all’s best player. Fools on here act like Canada is good at basketball and then also say shit like Kelly O is your best player.
Bro you traded Harden for Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley. The Sixers package was infinitely better and basically every analyst worth his or her salt has acknowledged you by it yourselves a shit sandwich because of petty Fertitta.   I do like Porter and Wood and Silas for you guys though.  Good luck.
It's a rare opportunity for Kelly Olynyk to dislocate another player's shoulder for his country.
When the Rockets traded Harden for Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley instead of Ben Simmons because their owner was petty petty Tom Petty.
Yeah. Everyone seems to agree. Sadly not much help with my nickname problem.  Probably going with Kelly “Dude Low Key Hoopin’” Olynyk.
Kelly “bucket “tear your arm off in the process” getter” olynyk
"No haha but Kelly Olynyk might genuinely be our second best player. I love that man.  John Walls 3 point attempts killed any momentum we had building for a come back, but it’s ok."
Miami Heat could use a Kelly Olynyk right about now
I’m glad Kelly Olynyk is finally getting the recognition he deserves.
If the Rockets weren't tanking Kelly Olynyk would win MVP
I always love after a national game for those few days where people stop talking shit about Ben Simmons because they witness how undeniably effective he is at winning basketball games.   Like I won’t deny he’s infuriating in the stretches where he takes his foot off the pedal offensively.   But he’s absolutely elite at every other part of the game.   And Houston traded Harden for Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley instead of him lmfao
Nice job leaving out the two triple doubles that both led to wins. The Heat started Kelly Olynyk at center against Anthony Davis and you expect them to win the series or he didn't play well.
All my homies hate Kelly Olynyk
&gt;Bony ass elbow  Bony ass elbow finally got fed up with *dirty-lowdown Olynykism* which refs allow for years. I always thought Kelly rivaled ZaZa Pachula with his UBER level of dirty lowdown tactics.  Happy to see here that Olynyk got his ass busted by KD
"Man KD why you got us having to defend Kelly Olynyk. I mean, still fuck that guy but you were definitely wrong for this."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ31539Cg04 This is why.  Fuck Kelly Olynyk.
Why fuck Kelly olynyk? I’m not disagreeing just not informed.
"If you elbow Kelly Olynyk in the face you should be awarded 2 FTs, the ball and Olynyk being ejected."
"&gt;Deserve to be tossed. With that said, fuck Kelly Olynyk  Nailed it."
I'll always appreciate anyone trying to eliminate Kelly Olynyk. Damn shoulder dislocator.
"I'm so conflicted. I mean, between this and the ball into the stands thing KD seems kinda tilted in general at the moment, and normally I'd disapprove a lot of this level of aggression on the court.  But, like... it's Kelly Olynyk."
Fuck Kelly Olynyk!
Fuck Kelly Olynyk!
Fuck Kelly Olynyk.
"I think he’s just frustrated with Kelly in this situation. He’s been setting suspect screens on everyone this year. Here you can’t see he wasn’t set at all and slides over on KD for a super illegal screen that didn’t get called.  No excuse to shove the guy, but someone was bound to get sick of Olynyk sooner or later."
Facts. I had a similar reaction to Kelly Olynyk getting elbowed in the face to when I heard about 9/11.
Kelly Olynyk didnt even do anything lol
"Deserve to be tossed. With that said, fuck Kelly Olynyk."
"Kd shouldn't of done that, but Kelly olynyk is one of the dirtiest players in the league."
kelly olynyk is a taller patrick beverley lol
Fuck Kelly Olynyk
Fuck Kelly Olynyk.
kelly olynyk is a dirty bitch and kd shouldve gotten a medal of honor not an ejection
"Kelly Olynyk is hilarious to watch on your team. Wendell Carter was ready to fight this dude literally just for existing yesterday, and tonight he frustrates KD to the point of ejection for the same thing"
"Yo, can you answer me why Kelly Olynyk was running point for your second unit?"
Jokic almost pulled a Kelly Olynyk on Towns there
Kelly “the Lunch Lady” Olynyk is a fucking stud
&gt; Missed Crowder and DJJ last year  And Kelly Olynyk
"Also Derrick Jones Jr and Kelly Olynyk who both played roles in that run. That’s besides the injuries, COVID, and a huge regression from Dragic."
"As a Laker fan I'm here to tell you [Kelly Olynyk helped the Heat get at least one win against the Lakers in the Finals last year.](https://youtu.be/QkZbb_hmJmM?t=17s) I dunno if he'd be the difference maker in this series with the Bucks, but it's entirely too dismissive to just say he was worthless for Miami."
"Miami letting go of Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynyk, Meyers Leonard and Dion Waiters really affected them apparently..  In reality, Jrue and PJ for Bucks has truly ascended them."
"Them letting go of Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynyk, Meyers Leonard and Dion Waiters really affected them apparently.."
"Anytime you can turn Kelly Olynyk into Victor Oladipo, you do it. It's unfortunate he got injured, but that's a good trade"
"Not much. That's probably the problem.  Actually, scratch that. They let go the Great White North GOAT PF Kelly Olynyk."
kelly olynyk would've been better in this match up than bam
Heat really miss Kelly Olynyk lol
"also missing greek god Kelly Olynyk, obv"
"Blake Griffin, Mike Dunleavy Jr., Kelly Olynyk, Goran Dragic, Mo Wagner"
"Who needs a center?  Here are some potential free agents.   Drummond, Gorgui Dieng, Cody Zeller, Kelly Olynyk, Meyers Leonard, Ibaka (PO), Montrez Harrell (PO), PJ Tucker, Robin Lopez, Ed Davis, Enes Kanter, Richaun Holmes, Theis, Noel, Biyombo, McGee, Alex Len, Khem Birch, Boogie, Dwight, Whiteside.   Noel might have to sign for the mid-level again."
"Oh yea, I mean look at these NBA lineups for last 2 months:  PG: Jamal Murray (21.2 pts/4 rbs/4.8 ats per game)  SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23.7 pts/4.8 rbs/5.9 ats per game)  SF: Luguentz Dort (19.5 pts/4.4 rbs/2.2 ats per game)  PF: Chris Boucher (14.1 pts/6.7 rbs/1.1 ats per game)  C: Kelly Olynyk (19.1 pts/8.6 rbs/4.2 ats per game)  Bench:   PG: Cory Jospeh  SG: RJ Barrett  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Dwight Powell  C: Khem Birch  Super-bench:  PG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SG: Trey Lyles  SF: Dillon Brooks  PF:  Dwight Powell  C: Tristan Thompson"
"It’s fine tho, they got...*checks notes* Kelly Olynyk...and some picks swaps..."
"Yeah, the bubble magically erased Jae Crowder and Kelly Olynyk from the team, and Dragic has aged faster because it's not the bubble. Right."
Bam is our 5.   Preferably at the 4 - find a player who can stretch the floor that's not Kelly Olynyk lol - Ariza leaving isn't a big deal. We literally got him for Meyers Leonard from OKC and he's just a guy we have to play since there's not many better options on the team.
Drummond is not ugly tf  It's probably Kelly Olynyk
What did Houston get for harden in the end? Kelly Olynyk???
Kelly “Maple Dick” Olynyk
Kelly olynyk is why the bucks were favored in every game. Heat got bubble luck
"If everyone was healthy and wants to play we would have:   SGA, Murray, Wiggins, Dort, Boucher, Brooks, Barrett, Tristan Thompson, Khem Birch, Oshae Brissett, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell, NAW from the Pels, Cory Joseph"
"I stand by my opinion that if the Celtics didn't bring fucking Kelly Olynyk to the meeting with Durant he would have been a Celtic. Who the fuck was like okay we have Tom Brady already but lets bring Kelly Olynyk? Imagine if they got Brady, Big Papi and Chara."
"Derrick Jones Jr., Solomon Hill, Meyers Leonard, Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynyk. These were tough role players they are missing now. Oladipo’s addition would have been big this year"
Kelly Olynyk loves playing for Canada and I have nothing but respect for him!
"Lol, what..zero Kelly Olynyk hate here.  After his strong year on Houston, he may be the 5 to 7th best Canadian in the league.  If he shows sustained solid defence he may even be our 5th or 6th best player now and possibly our best big man even.  He is on that tier just below Jamal, Shai, Wiggins, Barrett..."
"Lol, I do..always!  He reps Canada hard and wants to play each year, plus is besties with Jamal Murray and was one of the early commits last year and again this year too.  Honestly love his game and followed his whole career and because he played a few years of college and was a 2nd round draft pick to a weak team his buzz was never huge.  Showed flashes of promise late in his rookie year by than was injured his entire 2nd year.    He came back and had a great 3rd year lady year and now in his 4rth year he is A 2-way star, or close to it all season for Memphis.  He is a slightly better RJ Barrett type but will eventually get passed by RJ if RJ keeps going the way he is.  It's unlikely Brooks makes an all-star by game, but he will be near that level for a few years in his prime for sure.  He might be our 4rth or 5th main player in Victoria, or 5th to 7th with our complete team including Murray and all out stars.  Clearly we need some bigs to show up an play big for us, but I f I ranked guys right now, he may even be #4 or 5th, behind only Jamal, Shai and Wiggins and possibly be tied with RJ. Than Nekeil Alexander Walker.  Kelly Olynyk, Chris Boucher, Tristan Thompson would all be very close too.  Than, very close behind your next tier by would be the Brandon Clarke's, Khem Birch, Lugentze Dort, Dwight Powel, Oshai Brissett"
"Huh..toar his foot..??  Lol.  He was feeling the early signs of planters fasciculus almost 3.5 months ago and will have had 5 full months off by the time the Jun 29 to July 6th qualifying tournament begins in Victoria.  Just 3 to 4 years ago people played through these injuries, for example I believe Kelly Olynyk had this in his first draft year but only missed like Ke 2.5 months once he led it get worse and worse by playing on it.  It was not bad enough to require surgery, if it had it would of been a 5.5 to 6 month injury.  Although apparently it is healing slower than Ideal, this is a 3 to 4 month injury tops!"
now show the vid where chris paul tried to injure lebron by doing a kelly olynyk on him when he was on the rockets
"Kelly Olynyk too for the Heat. A lot of their big bubble contributors have either declined or are no longer there. Iguodala being paid 15 mill a year and scored 2 points in 15 mins of play each of these last 2 games.  Could def see him going back to GSW on a vet min this upcoming season. He wants to retire there and they could use some vets, like that Kerr said."
I'm always aboard the Fuck Kelly Olynyk train
"The disrespect to Kelly Olynyk smh. But for real, Crowder was huge against the Bucks last year"
"My best case scenario Canada team  First line  Sga, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Chris Boucher, Kelly olynyk  Second line  Cory Joseph, Dillion Brooks, Lu dort, Brandon Clarke, Khem birch   Third line  Kevin pangos, Nickel Alexander-walker, oshae Brissett, Dwight powell and Tristan Thompson"
More Kelly Olynyk hate.
Or Kelly Olynyk trying to elbow Joel's face in that same series
I totally forgot about Kelly Olynyk lol
Bruh did you really put 4 picks and 4 swaps as a sidenote to Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk would never allow this to happen
Somewhere out there Kelly Olynyk is heard screaming: You fucking need me. You can’t win without me.
No Kelly Olynyk he was the key
So glad we ended up with Kelly Olynyk instead of Ben Simmons 😎
"The box out by Chris Paul reminded me a lot of the one Kelly Olynyk had against Kevin Love in the playoffs. I never know how hurt Lebron is, it always seems like he’s playing it up but he never misses time due to injury"
"There's no such thing as an ""empty stats"" 25 PPG scorer. The only *real* empty stats guys are the ones like Kelly Olynyk on the Rockets right now, dudes who put up like 15-20 PPG on mediocre efficiency because their teams are terrible and they have complete freedom to jack up shots."
"Well yeah because ""rip"" could be what  Kelly Olynyk did to K Love or it could be this where he grabbed his arm and held it down. There's a big difference, and it's better to avoid emotional language if it wasn't dirty. Bron and CP3 hurt each other this game but both helped the other up, clearly it wasn't dirty"
How is Kelly Olynyk on two teams
Kelly Olynyk smiling somewhere.
You don’t need to use Kelly olynyk as an example of boxing out.
Chris “Kelly Olynyk” Paul
Chris Paul doing his best Kelly Olynyk impression
Chris Paul is literally Kelly Olynyk
Fair enough  Fuck Kelly Olynyk
"The Lakers two biggest wins in the Finals were when the Heat had everyone available. Weirdly they had more trouble with Miami when Kelly Olynyk was playing instead of Bam, but I'm not sure if you were still watching the playoffs by that point."
Kelly Olynyk was much better you’re right
I have no recollection of said game and certainly have no opinions about Kelly Olynyk
"Dedmon looked pretty good in the games he played for the heat   also Olynyk is not equal to Dedmon on defense, or rebounding, and Kelly is shooting 34% from three"
Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk is a Buck killer with his shooting. I don't think Lopez has a hard time guarding Dedmon.
Regularly travel for work to a small town where the only restaurant is Hardee's. I see it as the Kelly Olynyk of fast food. Decent off the bench situationally but you don't really want to rely on it in your main rotation.
Kelly olynyk and Larry Bird is only 2 degrees apart  Bird=Olynyk??
Well look into trading Kelly olynyk...again
"Houston Kelly Olynyk is kinda high on that list, but Chris Gatling and Dana Barros are the deep cuts.  Edit: For as far as overall play goes, but mostly with regard to scoring."
"Draymond. Draymond isn't as good defensively as he used to be. He's running on reputation at this point. Bam is buoying a team defence along with Jimmy playing on a team with a crap ton of negative defenders including Nunn, Dragic, Herro, Duncan and Kelly Olynyk."
My team used to have Kelly Olynyk so I know the pain.
Kelly Olynyk taking out Love in 2015 and KD going to GSW after 16 ruined what probably would have been the greatest set of NBA finals by and far. I doubt Kyrie gets injured in OT vs Hawks if Love was playing and KD to GSW has been beat to death already so I'll leave it at that. But 15-17 Cavs vs GSW should have been an all time rivalry and matchup.
Caruso is giving me Game 7 Kelly Olynyk vibes..
"Boban, Kelly Olynyk, Alex Caruso, Frank Kaminsk . . ."
Possibly just cut them that day so they were sharp? Idk lol  Either way he plays a little reckless and Im worried he'll pull a kelly olynyk and hurt somebody.
Bertans about to be the most hated man in DC since Kelly Olynyk
1. Wood 2. KPJ 3. Tate 4. KJ Martin 5. Khyri Thomas 6. Armoni Brooks 7. Sterling Brown 8. Kelly Olynyk
MVP: Kelly Olynyk ROY: Jaesean Tate DPOY: KJ Martin MIP: Kevin Porter Jr. COY: Silas
"Kelly Olynyk isn't a valuable piece.  If your goal was picks, 6ers had all their own picks, too.  Even if you assume they weren't willing to trade ALL the picks and ALL the swaps, Simmons could have been flipped for WAY more than Levert-&gt;Oladipo-&gt;like 1 pick and Olynyk.  Like I bet u Portland would give up all our remaining picks for Simmons from Houston in this scenario.  And, someone would have outbid Portland."
Did Kelly Olynyk have a sneaky good season or something?
"Crowder literally had LeBron's arm in like an armbar and was pulling back on it fucking wrestling style and people were saying Lakers fans were being babies for it. That move should be a flagrant 2, some Kelly Olynyk type shit (both teammates last year) but nah the LeBron hate has them blinded."
Kelly olynyk
"easy, kelly ...... olynyk"
No Kelly Olynyk though
So you'd take someone like Kelly Olynyk to help lead your team? No. Everyone knows fg percentage and to's are Russell's flaws. Wizards knew that going in but you ask Beal if he's glad Russell joined his team. Easily Beal's best teammate this year which couldn't possibly be true if he truly was as bad as his raptor stat indicates
KELLY OLYNYK TIME
He’s not a scrub but Kelly “Mapledick” Olynyk always shoots lights out against the Knicks
"&gt;Miami just made the Finals with the same free agent Minnesota and Philadelphia lost due to contractual dispute, an aging point guard they traded 4 picks for, 2 g-leaguers, a rookie picked 13th, a 3rd year player picked 14th, two journeymen veterans, and Kelly Olynyk.  Wait, so what you're saying is the the mid-to-late first round draft picks hadn't taken you guys anywhere until you landed a marquee free agent? The exact same thing that I said in response to your initial post?"
"Miami just made the Finals with the same free agent Minnesota and Philadelphia lost due to contractual dispute, an aging point guard they traded 4 picks for, 2 g-leaguers, a rookie picked 13th, a 3rd year player picked 14th, two journeymen veterans, and Kelly Olynyk.  The failures of Minnesota and Philadelphia have more to do with poor management than not being a marquee free agent destination.   I'm not blaming teams for tanking, though. That shit works, clearly. Doesn't change the fact that being rewarded for losing on purpose shouldn't be a thing."
Lol AD and lebron was eating Kelly Olynyk in the finals he literally was a traffic cone everyone blew by him.

Kelly Olynyk is one of the most underrated players in the league. He gets memed on heavy bc he looks like a frat boy But he is incredibly skilled for a 7 footer.
Fuck Kelly Olynyk
"Christian Wood, Eric Gordon, Victor Oladipo (when we had him), Kelly Olynyk, Kevin Porter Jr are all well known good players.   Sterling Brown shot 43% from 3 this year on high volume. Brooks is shooting 39%, KJ Martin is shooting 40%. Not even gonna name all the other players who have done well for us this year.  Why we acting like he was playing next to 15 Anthony Bennetts? Any other PG would have made the most of what they had instead of playing without a care in the world, especially when they want to prove themselves coming off an injury."
Jokic is a Serbian Kelly Olynyk
Kelly Olynyk best center in the NBA?
Kawhi and curry do it too. It's literally every star in the game. Even been seeing Kelly olynyk doing this now that he is the #1 guy (active and healthy) on the rockets
"&gt;LAC (currently 3rd in West) is 2 games back off Phoenix, and LAC has the    tiebreaker over Phoenix. LAC is also only 1 game ahead of Denver, and    Denver has the tiebreaker over LAC. LAC could finish in spots 2-4  Sucks for them considering they gonna get soloed by Kelly Olynyk"
