"**NEW YORK KNICKS**  Pleasant: Julius Randle by a MILE, Quickley honorable mention for being amazing as a #25 pick  Unpleasant: Obi Toppin, he hasn't been terrible and he's been injured but he's far from advertised, honorable mention to Elfrid Payton but I don't think he really counts as a ""surprise"" he just sucks"
"Knicks:  Pleasant, definitely Randle.  Unpleasant, Obi Toppin.  Not saying he‚Äôs bad, but I thought he‚Äôd have more of an impact. His role is kinda redundant considering our PF depth. That‚Äôs the only explanation."
"Outgoing players: Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, Mo Harkless, Daymean Dotson, Wayne Ellington  Incoming Players: Alec Burks, Austin Rivers, Nerlens Noel, Immanuel Quickley (rookie), Obi Toppin (rookie)"
"Players take time to develop, Obi toppin wasn't expected to be an immediate impact player; you could end up being right, but I give a rookie at least 2-2.5 years before I start to think they're a bust"
I thought Obi Toppin was doing good?  I guess not
"Leon picking his sons first big client in Obi Toppin over Tyrese is more egregious IMO  It‚Äôs great that the Knicks still got a great rookie PG in Quickley but the Toppin pick is leaving a lot to be desired especially for a franchise that has whiffed in the lottery a ton in recent years (outside of RJ who is gonna be an allstar) taking guys like Ntillikina, Knox, etc..."
"And Toppin has looked okay. Maybe not as NBA ready as you‚Äôd hope from a 23 year old but I definitely see the instincts and athleticism needed for some NBA success. That said, I think IQ is reliving some pressure off Obi early on."
People bring up Bennett everytime they doubt a #1 overall forward  If you want to see a real Bennett comparison go look at Obi Toppin
No stoppin Obi Toppin except pace
IQ is doing great. You were looking for Obi Toppin (who could still be a great player)
"&gt;Knicks absolutely blew it taking Toppin over this guy.   This. We took Obi and brought back wack ass Payton instead of getting Hali. Dumb as shit.  With that said, Obi's our guy now and I'm gonna support him because I'm invested in his development."
"No shot. Fultz is a much bigger bust thus far. Dragan Bender, Okafor, Hezonja, Exum, Bennett. All much worse. Lonzo is still just 23. He's like 50 days older than Obi Toppin. He obviously hasn't been good, of course."
"If Obi Toppin exists, can we safely assume the existence of an Obi Bottomin?  This dunk was lit tho, I only caught a bit of this game but Obi seems like an exciting young guy to have."

Can‚Äôt even get hyped for that Obi Toppin yam cuz I‚Äôm mad at the refs
OBI TOPPIN
Obi Toppin playing good defense üëÄ wtf
"I just focused on Toppin that whole defensive possession. He got too far under the rim on the first shot and couldn‚Äôt get the board, then left his man open for the 3 and closed out way too late to the point where he should‚Äôve just stayed under the rim for the rebound, and the Warriors got it cause he left the paint. That was kinda bad. Cmon Obi"
Alright here's a list of guys from mid-majors that had at least decent careers.   Chris Kaman Central Michigan  Kevin Martin Western Carolina  Danny Granger New Mexico  Patrick Bryant Bradley  Paul Milsap Louisiana Tech  Rodney Stuckey Eastern Washington  Jason Smith Colorado State  Jason Thompson Rider University  Courtney Lee Western Kentucky  George Hill IUPUI  Steph Curry Davidson  Gordon Hayward Butler  Paul George Fresno State  Larry Sanders VCU  Jimmer Fredette BYU  Kawhi Leonard San Diego State  Kenneth Faried Morehead State  Norris Cole Cleveland State  Shelvin Mack Butler  Damian Lillard Weber State  Kyle O'Quinn Norfolk State  CJ McCollum Lehigh  Isaiah Canaan Murray State  James Ennis Cal State Long Beach  Cam Payne Murray State  Larry Nance Jr Wyoming  Richaun Holmes Bowling Green  Ja Morant Murray State  Obi Toppin Dayton
"Yep. Wiggins was the same age the season he played with Butler as Obi Toppin is now. Just because there are 1 in a billion players like Luka and Lebron who have both the body and the game of a veteran at 19 doesn't mean that an inferior pre-prime player can't improve. It's perfectly normal for non-HOF players to have the game click for them at 24-25.  I'm touchy about this because I think Kings fans are doing the same thing to Bagley right now. Bagley's early struggles indicate he'll never be a franchise player, but that doesn't mean he'll never be an above-average starter who contributes to winning basketball. Why would a losing team turn their nose up at that potential just because they were wrong about the player's ceiling? Like don't compound your mistake by being wrong about the same player twice."
"Outside of the Warriors (who drafted their ‚Äúbig‚Äù 3 at 7, 11, and like 35) none of the Championship caliber teams got their stars through the draft. Milwaukee comes closest and they got Giannis at 15. Meanwhile the first team you named is struggling to do anything of note while boasting 3 players (Zion, Ingram, Lonzo) who went first, second, and third overall  Coach Bickerstaff has these kids playing and is changing the culture around the Cavaliers organization post-Kyrie and LeBron. That is the hardest thing to do and its fragile. Tanking this season COULD put us into position to draft a kid who MIGHT put us over the top, but making a run for the playoffs will make us a legit destination for FAs who are already proven. Its a delicate balance. For me, the FO sent a message drafting Okoro that at the time I disagreed with. I felt Okoro wasn‚Äôt that elite player to put us into contention but was too good to keep us near the bottom. I wanted Obi Toppin (who is better imo NOW but that wont be true by the end of the season) who I felt would excite the fans (Dayton product) but allow us so safely tank another season. We haven‚Äôt seen our preferred 5 play together nearly enough but when they do, they show flashes of elite potential and are playing for Coach. Drafting a big man is always risky and the league is getting smaller. The book seems to be written on KPJ in Cleveland but if he can turn it around a three guard set with SexLand, KPJ, Okoro, and Allen is also lethal"
"Mike Breen and Clyde Frazier  Mike Breen is obviously famous for his ""Bang!!!!"" calls and his shot for shot commentating, hes the Knicks home announcer, and Clyde Frazier is famous his his extensive vocabulary and constant rhyming (also he yells at the Knicks players when they ruin the plays lol)  Thriving and Surviving in the paint  Dishing and Swishing to the rim  It goes without saying that us getting Obi Toppin was a huge victory for us purely for rhyming purposes   Obi Toppin + Clyde Frazier = Best duo in the nba"
How has Obi Toppin been? I'm guessing he's still recovering from his injury?
Is obi toppin on a minutes restriction or anything like that
tier 1- obi toppin
obi toppin. tf happened to him
"Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina, Jared Harper, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullcock, Mo Harkless, Ignas Brazekdis, DSJ, Kevin Knox, Julius Randle, Obi Toppin, Immanuel Quickley, Mitchell Robinson, Tah Gibson."
"What‚Äôs up with obi toppin, I was hype to see him and quickly for the first time"
Why did Thibs just play Obi toppin for 57 seconds? Lmao
I highly doubt Obi Toppin (1) will be defending KD in the playoffs this year. Tonight though we shall see!
"I hope this happens for 2 reasons.  1: KD Kyrie and Harden need to win. That's too good of a big 3 not to. After the next off season they may end up better than KD warriors.   2: The Nets were the laughing stock of the league after that Boston trade and they've done this. Knicks have Julius Randle, RJ Barrett and Obi Toppin. Everyone in the Knicks front office should just fire themselves."
Obi   Toppin literally only played one game. Why are you using his 3pt percentage as if it means anything or like he's been apart of this team in any fashion for this season? lol
Oh damn the Knicks were missing Obi Toppin and Alec Burks? That changes everything
"You're missing some key points - Nerlens Noel just came back from injury, Alec Burks, Ntilikina, and Obi Toppin are also out. The bench is stretched super thin - that's why players are getting that heavy load."
"Obi Toppin is good and all, but the Knicks really missed again not taking Haliburton"

"Literally right now we have 2 healthy bigs on the roster (Randle and Robinson).  Obi Toppin, Omari Spellman and Nerlens Noel are all injured."
The reason they‚Äôre playing so much minutes is because half the team is injured. Mitchell Robinson played 40 minutes because Nerlens Noel and Obi Toppin are injured. Same goes for Randle and RJ
But have you seen obi toppin jump?
he's been playing ridiculously well. it's almost unbelievable how much he's contributing. every time he's off the floor (which isn't much bc thibs/obi toppin being injured) our scoring and defense suffers.
He literally said the same thing about Obi Toppin a few days ago lol
"1) RJ Barrett  2) Julius Randle  3) Mitchell Robinson  4) Immanuel Quickley  5) Austin Rivers  6) Obi Toppin  7) Alec Burks/Kevin Knox (can‚Äôt decide)  Elfrid Payton is all yours, Seattle"
"Julius randle is playing like an all star, they have a better record than the nets, raptors, and bucks, and they‚Äôve done it with injuries to obi toppin, immanuel quickley, and Alec burks."
"knicks have had a bunch of role guys injured like DSJ, ntilikina, alec burks (who specifically would get minutes from rj), obi toppin, and nerlons noel. think once most of them come back you‚Äôll see RJ and randles minutes go down a little to a more reasonable number like it was the first game or two of season when everyone was healthy"
Yeah! How dare you disrespect the Knicks! They do enough shooting themselves in the foot they don‚Äôt need it from you! * cough cough obi toppin*
Where's Obi Toppin?
Toppin and Quick both got hurt in game 1. last night IQ made his return. Obi was extremely underwhelming to me in the preseason and opening night but i think he just needs to find his footing. he might not be a star but he seemed pretty bust-proof offensively.   i think he‚Äôs best served as a small ball 5 in the dunkers position. unfortunately that‚Äôs not what this roster is constructed to do
Obi 1 is a much better nickname for Obi Toppin
Picking Obi Toppin over Haliburton will haunt the Knicks for a decade.
"Randle is our best player.  I think we can do a lot with him, Burks, Mitch and Quickley.  The jury is still out on Obi Toppin and I won't call RJ a bust yet but his performance this season has been concerning."
"Lol wut? Instead of getting Kenny Atkinson, a coach who has a track record with rebuilding teams, they hire Thibs who‚Äôs running his starters to the ground. How are Randle and RJ‚Äôs minutes sustainable? How many minutes is their rookie Obi Toppin playing per game?"
"I was throwing some potential names out there, maybe it isn't Collins but it could be Randle (he's expiring next year and the Knicks could be ready to go in a different direction, they drafted Obi Toppin to replace him so it's not crazy) or anyone else.  Smart =/= LeVert, and he's really a piece the Celtics want to keep if they're trying to win the title, he adds so much to the team.  Barnes would be an upgrade, I just don't favor impeding future flexibility for a marginal tweak that doesn't get the Celtics over the top."
Obi Toppin
They did not have those kinds of requirements. There was only 1 prop dunk and I don't recall seeing any dunks with assists. Obi Toppin jumped over some folks as well but that's about it.
"He's not correcting grammar, u/yusbishyus is trying to one-up u/OG3SpicyP by bragging that not only does he not know who Cassius Stanley is, he also doesn't know who Obi Toppin or Anfernee Simmons are.  Pretty much just bragging that he doesn't watch basketball."
"Nice. Yeah I‚Äôve just never heard of the name and it sounds like a rapper.    Like if there was a track and it said ‚Äúfeat. Drake, J. Cole &amp; Obi Toppin‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt blink an eye haha"
I‚Äôve never heard of Obi Toppin and when I got all these updates on my phone I kept thinking he was a rapper lol. So confused
Obi Toppin got robbed
Are these judges fucking stupid or something. Obi Toppin literally had the three best dunks of the night.
Apparently there is stoppin Obi Toppin.
that boy Obi Toppin is longggggg
"Obi Toppin and his dad reminds me of....  ....Ash Tray and his dad in the movie ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood"""
obi toppin dad look like slim charles from the wire
That was pretty underwhelming from Obi Toppin.
"I talked to Obi Toppin, and he told me to expect the unexpected, but I‚Äôm still expected..."
Bruh I thought Obi Toppin Sr was Pusha T
"Obi Toppin is the favorite.  Thanks, Kenny. He's in first place after one dunk."
"The 44 itself isn‚Äôt bad imo, the fact that Obi Toppin &amp; Simons were scored higher is what‚Äôs bad"
Obi Toppin would get more credit from the people if he was shorter
Obi Fucking Toppin!! Flex on them fools!
"The commentators are underselling that obi toppin dunk, that looks tough as hell"
That obi toppin dunk was dirty
Obi ‚ÄúI got the high ground‚Äù Toppin
obi toppin might be the most nervous man in the nba.
obi toppin sus
You can't not know how to dunk with the name Obi Toppin
My money on Obi Toppin
hows his name gonna be obi toppin when he gives no neck?
Obi Toppin doesn‚Äôt have a neck. He‚Äôs just a head on shoulders.
"Ah yes, now to watch Obi Toppin, Anfernee Simons and Cassius Stanley in the all star weekend dunk contest."
"Obi Toppin, gets me every time."
Oh shit bust boy Obi Toppin is in?
Obi Toppin looks like a 10 year NBA veteran
If Obi Toppin doesn't run away with this
Boy I can't wait to see what *checks notes* Obi Toppin can do in the dunk contest
"Good now enow of these losers.    bringeth out who is't we all cameth f'r. Obi motherfucking toppin  ***    ^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)  Commands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`"
Alright enough of these losers.  Bring out who we all came for....OBI Motherfucking Toppin.
"Cassius Stanley and Obi Toppin, welcome to the 2020-21 Eastern Conference All-Stars!"
Obi Toppin can play
Cassius Stanley and Obi Toppin. I like that.
Obi Toppin was player of the year in college basketball last year and a top ten pick who plays for the Knicks 15-20 minutes a game. If he‚Äôs too obscure for casual fans maybe they should put some damn effort into learning.
"Actually you know what... we‚Äôll give you Alec burks, taj gibson, Obi toppin and Derrick Rose for Jamal Murray... deal?"
how has Obi Toppin been? Are knicks fans happy with that pick?
"obi toppin grew up playing streetball all over nyc, i'm sure he's got some flashy moves  too bad they're probably gonna make him wear a jedi hood or some stupid shit because obi 1"
Obi Toppin should be fun atleast
"To be honest, I thought the Knox pick was great when it happened.... but yeah the Frank and Toppin picks weren‚Äôt so hot. No shot I‚Äôm writing off Obi yet, but the history behind older lottery picks is not in the Knicks‚Äô favor."
"Purely anecdotal, but the funny thing I've been gathering throughout the season is that a bunch of people think Gordon has won a Slam Dunk contest.  Clyde Frazier said it on the broadcast once when we played Orlando which you could chalk up to him just being old.  But then Obi Toppin was asked about winners that inspired him since he's entering the contest and said Lavine, Carter and Gordon.  Wade really did ruin the contest going with his guy.  If Gordon lost fair and square than so be it, but it's still pretty annoying that he basically just tricked the table into getting his guy the win and taking the fun out of it for all the viewers."
Cap its Obi Toppin the goat
"That's fair, a half dozen is an exaggeration. But we do see players just as freakishly athletic come in every year. Anthony Edwards, Obi Toppin, Devin Vassell just to name a few rookies off the top of my head from just this year with other world athleticism.  Regardless though. I don't even know how this is somehow a knock on Dwight. He's a phenomenal athlete. So is just about every great NBA player. That's how pro sports are"
"I really like breakdowns like this.  I liked Bagley quite a bit in his draft class. He needs to settle in as a role player rather than trying to force things imo. He's definitely got a future once he learns how to defend, because he has a lot of tools offensively.   I noticed his lateral quickness was pretty poor the other night and even PJ Washington took advantage of it a few times. It wasn't always this bad was it? I didn't notice this the previous few times i've watched him. That issue was the same reason Obi Toppin slipped in the draft, if he wasn't so stiff laterally he would've been a top 5 pick easy.  idk what can be done about that, but you can't be both slow laterally and constantly out of position. That'll get you abused on defense constantly. You'd need to be Amare' Stoudemire good to overcome being that kind of a liability on defense."
Bro has amazing bounce i wanna see him back in dunk contest with obi toppin
Obi do be Toppin doe
"Okay, well when you word it the way you did you‚Äôre specifically inviting comparison  And the guy isn‚Äôt really young, he‚Äôs literally older than Tatum. It‚Äôs like if I said Obi Toppin was doing great things for someone his age everyone would be confused why I was emphasizing the age for a 22 year old rookie"
You must not be familiar with Obi Toppin
obi toppin will have the greatest dunk contest ever. don't @ me.
Obi Toppin. Real name. No Gimmicks.
Knicks just drafted Obi Toppin... dude looks atrocious on both sides of the floor
https://dailyknicks.com/2020/11/21/knicks-obi-toppin-steal-nba-draft/
"Levine, Zion, Anthony Edwards, Obi Toppin   End of discussion."
Obi Toppin
Obi Toppin
OBI TOPPIN
"Things like this make me scratch my head, wtf did you drafted Obi Toppin?"
You had an Obi Toppin' joke right there.
"Ugly win but we take those. This game showed us what having an athletic center in Mitch can do to this team. Once the wolves started going, They were getting everything in the paint. Love Noel but Mitch is a force in the interior.  I think we easily stop that comeback if Mitch is in, forcing teams to shoot from the perimeter.   Starting to worry a little about IQ, usually he has those bounce back games but rookie walls are a thing. Not too worried though.  One thing I liked is that he‚Äôs trying everything in his bag when one isn‚Äôt working, the floater or his 3 point shot or the handoffs. As he adds more stuff he‚Äôll diversify his scoring. And it‚Äôll help build his confidence.   Obi Toppin - had some nice assists but I think we need to question what the FO was doing by taking him. Toppin was projected as NBA ready as you can get but he looks lost out there like Knox did. His woes have been overshadowed by quickley‚Äôs prolific scoring but sooner or later the conversation needs to be had. He really needs to shore up his shooting or be able to create his own shot. Otherwise he‚Äôs just a catch and shoot which he‚Äôs not good at. I‚Äôd like to see him iso a bit more to help build his confidence. Right now he functions as a mini playmaker who hands the ball off close to the post. Would like to see him work with Kenny Payne and get his post game going. Like his attitude and he‚Äôs got the tools for success, just needs the right development."
"That‚Äôs awesome and all, but hasn‚Äôt he been horrendous defensively? Like I watch enough Obi Toppin to know bad defense. Where does Zion compare?"
Kemba brown and Tatum for Julius randle and obi toppin
Obi Toppin
"Miles bridges, Anthony Edwards, Obi Toppin, Ja is who I want to see"
He hasn't stood out too much in games but I wouldn't be surprised if they put Obi Toppin in there based on his dunks outside the NBA like they did Derick Jones Jr in 2017
Fucking Obi Toppin plays like Blake Griffin after 15 years in the league. I don‚Äôt get it.
Obi Toppin with some really high shoes
"We should‚Äôve traded Blake last year and kept C wood but typical pistons office, I‚Äôm from the D and I‚Äôm tired of this team, we draft kcp over the Greek freak we draft Luke kennard over don Mitchell, we gave Reggie to much money we gave up T Harris Avery Bradley and boban for Blake and now we needa trade him, shit is a waste of time, not to mention we give up our franchise center who‚Äôs been leading league rebounding for years for fucking Brandon knight and I never even seen him this whole year, we draft killigan hates over obi toppin shit crazy, grant is pretty good but 60 mil cmon man that‚Äôs way to much, at this point idk what we should do we have nothing. We should‚Äôve found a way to trade Reggie for Kemba but we dropped the ball so bad if we were gonna get rid of Drummond and Reggie we could‚Äôve used them in a big trade package, our roster is shit and we really have no players that anyone want we just gotta pray pistons fans hopefully the new GM knows what he‚Äôs doing because he did a good job in OKC"
"Obi ""The 8th pick"" Toppin is available."
Obi toppin betta shut his dumbass up and hit the gym! Bum ass mf
NY Post: Is the darker Immanuel Quickly A Colorist? The Point Guard Feels Need to Introduce Audience to Obi Toppin
"Even if Quickley does somehow pan out long term, the Toppin over Hali pick was still a blunder of the lowest order.  You *always* load up with potentially elite two way playmakers, rather than one way PFs that can‚Äôt play defense üòÇ obviously.  Take Quickley as well, if you want.  Having a backcourt with Hali &amp; Quickley is about a million times better than having Obi freaking Toppin on your team"
"Toppin wasn't baffling, he also went lower than expected and given his NY connections likely for similar reasons (the article makes a point of mentioning the Haliburton thing wasn't isolated). Randle took a massive developmental leap, with a minute load that limits how we can use Obi short-term. We're consciously placing him in a role that doesn't play to his current strengths (71% at the rim but half his FGA are threes), so it's a little pointless to judge. We'll see what they look like in a year or two."
Obi toppin‚Äô? More like Obi Hoppin‚Äô!!  Ha. Ha.   Ok I‚Äôll leave

"legendary call by Marv Albert: ‚Äúoh, a spectacular move by Obi Toppin!‚Äù"
"Obi Toppin? Yeah, he's poppin."
Kinda like Knicks with Obi Toppin even though Obi has looked really good recently
"Obi has looked really good since the arrival of Derrick Rose.   In other words, Dickley is Toppin obi off"
Peeped your IQ and Obi Toppin art on r/NYKnicks last week!  Your art is fire bro!
"That's a shame. I always want players from the A-10 to do well, and I loved Obi Toppin at Dayton."
No the gm son is one of Obi Toppin agents
"Knicks have suckkkked at drafting since Porzingis.   Obi Toppin over Tyrese Haliburton  Kevin Knox over Shae Gilgious Alexander, Michael Porter Jr and Mikal Bridges  Frank Ntilikina over Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo"
"That‚Äôs Obi ‚ÄúNational Player of the Year, no media attention during draft day, quiet production‚Äù Toppin for you."
"Knicks play at a snail's pace for today's game. Still a phenomenal defense, but our young athletic team is gimped by guards that can only operate the half-court set and are too slow to run the floor.   There are many times where Obi Toppin races ahead in the fast break only to have to sacrifice a dunk/lob opportunity because the guards walk the ball up the court. Really frustrating to watch how we've been pigeonholed into Grit n' Grind by Elfrid Payton.  Hopefully over the season DRose will bring up the pace, and we all know how electric IQ is going to be."
Obi Toppin 500 piece in game 7 of the ECSF to bring the Knicks to the ECF
Hes talented. You can see why he was the number 1 receuit over zion. He wants to be kobe but has to let the game come to him cause hes good at a lot of things right now but not elite at any. If the list was 30 or 35 players hed definently be on it. But after watching him for 2 seasons would you trade him for a top 5 pick in this draft. I would in a heartbeat but I dont think youd have any takers. The obi toppin over haliburton pick is gonna hurt us way more. I dont think he can play in the leauge
Yea but Obi Toppin was the best player in college basketball that year
"Knicks drafted Obi Toppin 8th and he was 22 when drafted, so it definitely happens"
Kevin Knox and Obi Toppin have high arcs
"I‚Äôm very high on Toppin.  If he can get a little stronger and play the small ball 5 he will be a beast.  He has excellent touch, in air flexibility, and shot making skills.  The long range shot will come along.  He been used as a wing and was very uncomfortable handling the basketball on the perimeter to start the year.  Despite the discomfort and lack of playing time he's shot well from everywhere but 3.  He is also an excellent passer which leads me to believe he will figure out his floor game.  I highly doubt Obi will be a bust.  I don't know if he has the scoring potential to be a star but im pretty confident he will be good"
Would you like Obi Toppin and Elfrid Payton? Sincerely - a Knicks fan
Obi Toppin should have gotten more minutes. His energy gave us problems for a stretch
"I should just rephrase my comment as ""I REALLY want to see obi toppin succeed"""
THERE'S NO STOPPIN' OBI TOPPIN
NO FUCKIN STOPPIN OBI FUCKIN TOPPIN
OBI TOPPIN WITH THE SLAM
THE OBI TOPPIN BREAKOUT GAME IS HERE
"Even tho I want to win this games and don't really like knicks fans or the knicks, I hope obi toppin succeeds, he was so fun to watch at dayton"
Except Obi Toppin was consistently mocked ahead of Halliburton before the draft and a lot of guys were taken ahead of Halliburton.
Obi Toppin and a three and d wing
Yeah Man U see how good Obi Toppin is! Wait a sec...
Obi Toppin
"They said he was Amar'e Stoudamire with some comparison, and I was thinking with few games I watch no way Obi Toppin as athletic as Amar'e Stoudamire."
"I think we can add Obi Toppin to that list too. I hate writing a guy off after 40 games in a weird season, but the writing is on the wall for him."
It‚Äôs ok we got.. uh... uhh... Obi Toppin
Literally Obi Toppin
You sound mad. Obi toppin is not good which is why he doesn‚Äôt get minutes.
Obi Toppin tonight: I am the Giannis now
Knicks were too gassed at the end. Randle in particular. The problem is that Obi Toppin is so useless they need to sub pack in Randle after 2 min or give up a 12-0 run
"Right now, I think Obi Toppin's not being used properly for the Knicks.      For someone athletic as Obi Toppin is, he's not really rolling to the rim that often. Instead, you'll see Thibs put Taj Gibson and Obi Toppin in a double ball screen at the top of the key, where Gibson rolls to the rim and Toppin spaces to the top of the key. This is in direct contrast with his advertised college skills, where he was an athletic lob finisher and often played as the big making the handoff to a sprinting guard and slipping in for athletic finishes.      Either you see him running that play with some random guard, or you'll see Obi Toppin spacing in the corner, where he's been absolutely horrid this season. Pretty much at all times, he's riding around the 3 point line. In my opinion, this makes him absolutely useless, as Obi Toppin wasn't advertised as a capable 3 point shooter coming out of college. In fact, it was his most questionable skill(outside of his lateral agility/perimeter defense). He shot well from 3 for Dayton, but on limited opportunities.      Yeah he's been bad this season, but I honestly think that Toppin's being used insanely poorly right now. He's never near the rim, neutralizing his athletic gifts. He can't finish without a good ball handler/passer feeding him(surprise, we don't have any great ball handlers/passers this season; maybe Derrick Rose, but IQ and RJ and Payton aren't great), and not being near the rim removes any ability for him to get putback dunks with his athleticism. If Thibs drew up some plays for Toppin where we just run the 2 man game at the top of the key, with a spaced floor, I bet Toppin would be better. But right now, nah he really sucks."
We were so so close last night but Obi Toppin had to get in the fucking way of Randle
Damn he really went at Obi Toppin. Not cool imo.
Obi Toppin saved a man's life today.
"It‚Äôs hard to gauge toppin because Randle gets so man minutes. He average 5 points in 12 minutes on 50% from the field. So I‚Äôm 12 minutes there‚Äôs not much he can show.   On top of that, we still don‚Äôt have a legit point guard on the team to set him up in pick and roll situations. Randle is our point guard majority of the times but he‚Äôs not really a lead ball handler in today‚Äôs nba. Quickley, Frank, RJ are more secondary than Lead guys. Payton sucks, and Rose is more of a scorer.   Once we get a legit PG that can run the offense Obi will shine more. He‚Äôs a strong finisher, lob finisher, and rim runner"
The Frank Ntilikina/Obi Toppin bench unit happened
God Obi Toppin is just dissapointing.
"They did draft Obi Toppin tho, they‚Äôre still the Knicks at heart."
Kevin Knox over Shai and Obi Toppin over Hali
"Uhhh...I mean who even has more trade value between those two? Buddy on his contract or Bagley, I‚Äôm assuming Buddy probably?  Kind of like the Knicks for Hield but I‚Äôm not sure how the salaries can match. Knicks would have to send 5 players but maybe Obi Toppin Ntilkina and 3 expiring for those 2? Ntilikina gives the kings a backup defensive PG also basically what Cory Joseph was supposed to be  Gauging Bagley‚Äôs trade value in general is hard. Didn‚Äôt know whether to include Knox or not also"
"- Warriors get: Elfrid Payton  - Knicks get: Brad Wanamaker, Eric Paschall + 2nd round pick  ....... next trade  - Bulls get: Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, Reggie Bullock, Frank Ntilikina + 2 1st round picks  - Knicks get: Zach Lavine, Tomas Satoransky"
"I have the same question for Obi Toppin, this draft is looking bad so far"
Idk could‚Äôve drafted Obi Toppin based on MJ‚Äôs recent history
"The Obi Toppin hate is really starting to get annoying. He's over 56% true shooting and is becoming an average individual defender that constantly communicates switches and assignments. His biggest red flag from draft day now feels like a short-term inconvenience (help D awareness is the next step), while his offense is just low-volume due to backing up our star player in Randle.   Haliburton is someone I was very interested in on draft day and I hope he keeps it up, but the 2020 draft was the biggest crapshoot in modern NBA history. With that many point guards in the lottery, some were going to boom and some were going to bust."
I've never seen the dunk Obi Toppin did. My jaw actually dropped.
"I am having a hard time understanding why the Knicks are getting so much praise.   1. They are more likely to miss the playoffs than to make it still. They have been one of the healthier teams in the league and are only up 2.5 games on 11th seed Hawks.  2. For how good Quickley has been, the other top pick Obi Toppin has looked quite mediocre.   3. What is their ceiling? I understand Knicks fans don't have much going for them but are you all gonna be satisfied being a team who is majority of the time a first round exit?"
Will Obi Toppin develop into a quality player over time?
"I remember seeing the video of Lamelo with two fingers up before the warriors made their pick.  There was a thread on it on the /r/warriors.  We'd just gotten the news about Klay.  I was dejected, because I honestly thought, for about a good hour, that Ball was going to be the pick at #2.  I remember being sick to my stomach.  I made a comment in that thread, at the time, saying as much.    I couldn't be happier that the warriors passed on Ball.  Nothing against the guy, but thank goodness the team passed.  I don't know if they told Lamelo they were going to pick him, or whatever they told him.  Doesn't matter to me, they made the right pick, and that's all I really care about, at the end of the day.    I felt like, out of everyone in the draft, Lamelo had one of the top odds of winning ROY.  My top 3 list of ROY contenders before the draft were:  1) Obi Toppin - I legit thought his rookie year would be fantastic.    2) Lamelo Ball - I was sure he would be good right away.  3) Tyrese Haliburton - he was always going to get off to a fast NBA start.  The things I felt about the 3 guys I had on the ROY leader board was they all shared a common trait: very advanced skill level for their age, which should facilitate immediate contribution, and a lack of the rawness that could hold them back early in their career.    However, as we move out of the rookie year, and onto season 2, season 3, and onwards in their careers, talent has a way of always dominating the equation as time goes on.    Now that I've seen Anthony Edwards play a lot in the NBA, the best comparison I can make for him is a young Russell Westbrook.  Edwards has 98 percentile NBA athletic traits, and his peak years, once he figures out what he's doing, will be Westbrook-eque.    Now that I've seen more of Patrick Williams, I see his NBA comp as Paul George.  Despite being 1 year younger than George was as a rookie, Williams' stats are better across the board than George's were.  I think he's going to grow into a really great 2-way wing in the NBA, and I'm bullish on his career, and was before the draft (Williams was my #3 overall prospect).  If the choice was Williams or Ball, I'd have drafted Williams.    I've seen every NBA minute James Wiseman has played, as a warriors fan, and he's exactly what I thought he would be: all the talent in the world, advanced as far as skill level goes (shooting, dribbling, the kind of things you can work on by yourself in a gym), but very raw as far as concepts go (the kind of stuff you learn playing high-level organized basketball).  He still doesn't know where to be on offense, he still gets in the way of his teammates sometimes, and he still shows lack of awareness on defense.  It's not that he's not hard working, it's that he just doesn't know.    Right before the all-star break, there was a play (forget the opponent) when Wiseman was camped out in the paint, and big had the ball right in front of him, the big whipped the ball out to the perimeter, and the perimeter guy whipped the ball to a backdoor cut to the basket.  Wiseman didn't turn and contest the shot, because he didn't know what the rotation was, what his responsibility was, and what he was supposed to do.  If he turns to contest the shot, the cutter passes to the big who is Wiseman's man and it's an easy dunk, if he stays with his man, the cutter gets an easy layup.  He doesn't know where his help is, and he doesn't know what the right play is.    That's not lack of defensive awareness, it's lack of not playing NBA basketball very much.  It will get better in time.  That's why Wiseman's ceiling is so high.    Lamelo doesn't have those issues.  He already knows the NBA game, already knows where to be, and already knows what to do.  That makes him better right now, but he has a lower ceiling."

"Imagine how good they'd be if they had taken Haliburton instead of Obi Toppin! Seriously, he could have taken Payton's minutes (during which they were outscored on the season) and also played off the ball with Rose in closing lineups. And he can defend too. Would have been a great fit, man.  I can't say anything, my dumbass disaster of a team took Killian Hayes. I've enjoyed watching this Knicks team, they play their asses off every night. Randle is just damn good and RJ Barrett improved tremendously from last year.  Too bad there aren't many good free agents this year, they'd actually be an attractive destination for once. Who's available the summer after this one?"
"As a Laker fan, I was pleased when Obi Toppin was the sole defender on some of our players (we usually scored on him)."
"That's your top 10 pick with decent upside Obi Toppin, you don't just give up on a high draft pick when they're not downright horrible"
"23 years old, defensive stalwart and offensive prodigy Obi Toppin.. At least Markkanen can spread the floor and give you efficient 15-20 depending on the role."
"We are the most valuable team in the nba and one of the most valuable teams in sports period but we‚Äôve been the laughing stock of the nba for years. Consistently making bad moves, bad draft picks and just being bad. We were the go to team when making a joke. In 2019 we drafted RJ Barrett with the 3rd pick in the draft and we signed Julius Randle who was never considered that good of a player. Recently, Julius Randle has made an insane jump and he‚Äôs become an allstar this season. Our team isn‚Äôt as good as others but we play hard defense and hustle harder than every other team and we‚Äôve surpassed expectations. We have a few young players with potential, rj barrett, Immanuel Quickley we drafted with the 25th pick, Mitchell Robinson, Obi toppin he‚Äôs a high flyer dunker. And we have good vets, Derrick Rose was one of the best young players in the nba and would probably be an all time great but injuries ruined his career. This year he has been really good but in his prime before the injuries he was a top 10 player in the nba. Julius Randle is our teams leader. New York has two teams, us and the nets. The nets are one of the best teams in the league but most New Yorkers don‚Äôt really like them. We also play in Madison square garden.   Here are some videos about us currently   https://youtu.be/CDPJ2hlboAM  https://youtu.be/KvODVmmraZU   Here‚Äôs one of our best games this season   https://youtu.be/qRNZ7qaIwu8    Here‚Äôs a video about why we have been so bad throughout the years    https://youtu.be/TjmtQ-oee9E"
"Noel is a journeyman 5, Gibson wasn't even on the roster when Obi was drafted. And clearly the FO didn't think Randle was going to be here long-term. Not defending the pick, because I certainly wouldn't have taken Toppin and it was clearly a bad decision. But the roster had holes everywhere, if they thought Toppin was BPA then Knox or Noel weren't going to stop them from taking him"
"Yeah, this. At the draft Toppin was a solid pick, he looked like one of the few NBA ready prospects. Randle just completely killed the chance of him getting any minutes, plus Nerlens Noel has played really solid for the them too. It all adds up to Obi not having any real chance at minutes."
"Do you understand how bad the expected value of a bottom half of the lottery pick is? Here's the last 10 #8th overall picks   Obi Toppin  Jaxson Hayes  Collin Sexton   Frank Ntilikina  Marquese Chriss  Stanley Johnson  Nik Stauskas   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope   Terrance Ross   Brandon Knight    Look at this list. Sabonis is way, way better than basically every single person listed. The average expected value of the 8th pick or lower is like ""solid role player"", not ""All Star"".    Even the Raptors would trade a low lottery pick for Sabonis. Even if he doesn't fit your system, Sabonis would be more beneficial to you than some decent role player that you're most likely going to draft."
I'm from the future. Obi Toppin

"Knicks:  1. Derrick Rose, SS, great defender, sill enough speed, good contender to be a 20/20 guy, maybe will have to be a 2B/3B later in his career if his knees give out 2. Julius Randle, 3B, man is in purely for his offense, average/below average defender 3. RJ Barrett, P, Shohei Ohtani type player, I've seen some nice full court football style passes from him this year 4. Obi Toppin, RF, Hiding him in RF for shaky defense but will definitely make some highlight plays. great athleticism makes him a potential 30/30 guy 5. Mitchell Robinson, 1B, nothing is getting over his head at 1B, massive strike zone is  definitely negative though 6. Immanuel Quickley, LF, I could see him being a plus defender in left, probably more of a put it in play, don't strike out guy on offense. 7. Elfrid Payton, 2B, No chance he hits over the mendoza line but will play gold glove level defense. 8. Frank Ntilikina, CF, great reaction time make him a premier defensive center fielder, his quick hands give him a potential utility role as a middle infielder. 9. Nerlens Noel, C, Gonna hose guys down at second, veteran leader who can call a good game for our young pitcher. Like the 7 and 8 hitters, likely won't do much on offense"
Know who really makes me think of Ajinca? Obi Toppin. No offense to Obi or to say anything of his game. But visually I just can‚Äôt get past it
Obi Toppin robbed. In the month of April he ate 7 burritos.
"This team would be so fucking good if Knox, Frankie Smokes or Obi Toppin make an actual leap next season. Probably no chance for the first two and ain't looking good for Obi so far."
Obi Toppin should be number 1
"Knicks win in a 7 game thriller over the Dallas Mavericks, Obi Toppin Baptizes KP for the game winning dunk, no bias."
Obi Toppin SZN lfg
"It would definitely be better if he played a bit less. I love him and he‚Äôs an absolute baller but i mean cmon the minutes are insane. Same goes for RJ. I think the issue with Melo would be that even though Toppin has been rough, i don‚Äôt know if the Knicks want to give up on him quite yet. Melo at the backup 4 would push Toppin into obscurity. Thibs runs a tight ship.  Maybe if they played Melo alongside Randle/Obi at the 3 it could work though"
"I would personally be willing to sell high on Randle if I were the Knicks.  They drafted Obi Toppin in the top 10, if you aren't going to make minutes for him then why take him over Haliburton?  They could get a haul for Randle and keep collecting assets until they find the right player to pair next to Barrett."
"it just feels like the Knicks have gotten the best out of Randle and Barrett this year by giving them the ball.  Barrett is improving as a shooter, in another year or 2 he might be a potent off-ball threat that'd make more sense as that secondary creator, still for now you'd hope that he can get more touches &amp; opportunities and continue to develop his off-the-dribble game where he's actually really impressive.  He's got good size &amp; speed and plays pretty physically so developing that part of his game &amp; empowering him to develop those drive &amp; kick instincts seems good for his development.     As for Randle, he's at his best when he gets a rebound and goes on a rampage, he can punish mismatches &amp; switches which will be harder to do if CP3 is barking at him for the ball every possession so they can walk it up &amp; run floppy or horns.     DeRozan would be the nut low for the Knicks, as you say he solves none of their problems and exacerbates some of their worst issues (spacing).    My thinking would be that if Obi is the future, the Knicks could explore trading Randle (they might be able to get a haul despite his expiring contract next season) to collect young players that fit Barrett &amp; Toppin and then leverage their cap space to keep collecting assets so that they can strike when the next in-their-prime superstar becomes available and/or find a young player on the rise to pair with their young star on the rise (Barrett).  The answer just depends on what the Knicks FO wants to do: make playoff noise or maximize their odds at winning a championship.  Historically, the path to a championship has been building through the draft and getting superstars in their prime.  DeRozan/Powell/CP3 don't fit that bill."
"This is what Hollinger says:  &gt;Hollinger: I had Hayes ranked as the No. 3 player on my board, and while that first part of the season was a ghastly mess, he‚Äôs shown of late why his passing and defense got scouts‚Äô attention. Looking at the overall body of work, I still have to move him down a bit ‚Äî certainly behind Haliburton, for instance ‚Äî because his stat line remains brutal.   &gt;However, given that few players from this lottery have made a thundering impression (my fourth- and fifth-ranked players, for instance, were Onyeka Okongwu and Obi Toppin), I think it still makes sense to snag Hayes here. My one misgiving about Hayes is that his passing isn‚Äôt really going to weaponize until he can become more of a threat as a scorer, and that‚Äôs the one part of his game that‚Äôs the iffiest to project. Nonetheless, on-ball talent always wins out in any draft scenario; Hayes still has a chance to be a team‚Äôs lead creator, and that‚Äôs worth the roll of the dice here."
"Me. It seemed like another year of no hope. Was sick of Julius Randle already, was unsure how RJ would develop, Austin Rivers was our starting pg. Figured if Knox and Frank were busts, that would be that. I was excited for the return of basketball after the bubble, but was really only excited to watch Mitchell Robinson and Obi Toppin. I thought I‚Äôd check out mid-season."
"Much longer? Literally two year bro  To answer your question Obi Toppin. He's older/same age as a lot of 2nd/3rd year players, even some 4th year ones"
"I personally think he‚Äôs been encouraging. Does he score a lot of points? No and he has struggled offensively but I think overall, if you told me Obi Toppin from Dayton would be a solid defender in the NBA last year around this time, I would‚Äôve laughed. The scoring will come when he gets more consistent minutes and more pick and roll opportunities. Currently, Thibs uses him more as a floor spacer and I‚Äôve noticed teammates wave him off when he tries to set picks for them.   I was never worried about him offensively, more so defensively and whether his minutes at the NBA level would impact actual winning vs him just putting up numbers and being flashy. I think long term this is great for him"
"Had the same thought. I think 7 of the top 10 posts today are Knicks related. Some of them are legit, but some are just so stupid it makes me laugh. Who cares that Rose had 17 points? Why do I care that Obi Toppin and Kevin Knox are shooting after the game? Fans just setting themselves up for disappointment hyping up a mediocre squad this much."
How‚Äôs Obi Toppin been?
YERRRRRRRRRRR  Shoutout to Obi Toppin for looking like an actual NBA player and being HUGE for us in the third quarter. I love this team.  LETS MAKE IT TEN STRAIGHT!
LETS. FUCKING. GOOOOOOOOOOOO  Shoutout of the day to OBI TOPPIN for looking like an actual stretch 4 with finishing capabilities. GOOD SHIT
"Julius Randle is a plus defender but he isn't being talked about for DPOY because he isn't an elite defender. That being said, without Randle, the Knicks would probably be an average defensive team, even with Thibs' coaching. The next man up at the 4 is Obi Toppin, who is... not good defensively  The Knicks best defender this season has been rim protectir Nerlens Noel. He should make an All Defensive team for how terrific he's been"
This shows that you don‚Äôt understand the game on a high level such as me. Julie Randle is out of the conversation. Now Obi Toppin has a decent argument to be made
Yeah until he trades himself to the Knicks for taj Gibson and Obi toppin
"Have you seen the Knicks rotation? Reggie Bullock, Nerlens Noel, Elfrid Payton, RJ Barrett, Derrick Rose, Obi Toppin is not better than Draymond, Wiggins, Oubre, Looney, Poole, Bazemore"
Knicks aren‚Äôt a fast break team and I swear obi toppin just learned how to run normally
[Highlight]  The rim has its plunging hotness penetrated with vigour as Obi Toppin unloads his sex missile slam dunk to the hilt and into its aching core!
Obi Toppin üò≠
"Well I think we do have players who are bad defensive players. Obi Toppin and Quickley namely. Both aren‚Äôt starters yet and more importantly both are rookies. Maybe it‚Äôs a Knicks fan wishing on a star again, but I think under Thibs, it really shouldn‚Äôt be an issue after the offseason."
Obi Toppin. Thought he was gonna be good but haven‚Äôt really heard much about him due to his underwhelming play so far.
Let‚Äôs talk about Obi Toppin mid 70s
"Obi Toppin is 23. He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing. Way too early to call him a bust, but it puts into perspective how soon he should be expected to start developing."
Obi Toppin
" Yeah, Obi Toppin pretty much did 2 things for the first half of the season, either spotting up from the corner or flashing out above the arc in a double staggered ball screen. Neither are really his strengths, so he hasn't been used the right way this season. If we actually played him like a John Collins, DeAndre Jordan, or just about any other actual athletic rim runner, he'd be dropping jaws with how often he exerts his physicality over others. But right now, Thibs is using him like a spot up shooter."
Tobi Hoppin' &gt; Obi Toppin
Obi Toppin and Knox
"He has 4 years under contract, I don‚Äôt think the Blazers owe it to him to do him a solid by giving him away to the Knicks for some mediocre 1st round picks and Obi Toppin.  Players honoring their supermax contract is important otherwise what was the point of it in the first place?"
If Obi Toppin gets traded to a team where he gets more playing time I can see him breaking out

"This is over. Kwahi got everyone open looks.   Trade idea:  PG13 for Immanuel Quickly, Obi Toppin, a pick, Reggie Bullock.  Clips ditch pg13, get more shooters and a top pick."
"I‚Äôm gonna go with Cole Anthony, Obi Toppin, and Onyeka Okongwu."
"&gt; but then I think Obi Toppin was the MVP.   That's subjective but also intentionally ludicrous to type out. No one will take you seriously if you compare role players to star players leading their teams. And you had the nerve to bring up ""common sense"" lol.

It seems like you‚Äôre just saying *it‚Äôs subjective*, which like, sure, but then I think Obi Toppin was the MVP. The fact that there‚Äôs a subjective element to it doesn‚Äôt open the floodgates for guys with no commonsense or precedented reason to sniff the MVP award or for it to be accepted when a homer/dinosaur/insert-pejorative-here writer gives them a nod."

"That's hindsight. If I remember correctly, Porzingis was still rehabbing an injury and the Mavs didn't know if he would be pre-injury Porzingod again or come out a little bit more Greg Oden. Like that was a potential steal with significant risk or being a sunk investment. Imagine they didnt do the trade and kept Smith Jr...Would their '20 pick be significantly better than 18th? If they slide up to 8, that's Obi Toppin (which had a requirement of your Knicks 21-45 record) and from the current 20/20 perspective BPA would have been Haliburton (selected 12th). Is that a championship core? Maybe taking the Clips to 7 games with Luka magic and a workable support group will make them a juicy free agency option?!?"

People ALWAYS overestimate the ceilings of older prospects who are more NBA-ready when they play useful minutes in the first couple of years.   Kuzma is older than Aaron Gordon, who was picked in 2014.  Tatum is one day older than Obi Toppin, who was picked in 2020. Kuzma and Tatum were in the same draft  class."
"I do have a few concerns about their future. Randle didn't have a bad game or two in this series, he was bad every game. Makes me wonder if teams will figure him out next season now that they have tape of how to stop him in 5 straight games. The other concerns is really the roster. Thibs really got a ton out of very little. Taj is up there in age, Rose is best coming off the bench and is gonna be a year older, Elfrid and Noel have no offensive game, Burks was good but hes been a journeyman since leaving the jazz. Thibs needs to find out what hes got in Toppin and Knox. Those two didnt get much playing time. Ideally i like to see thibs give knox and obi more minutes, mitchell robinson is healthy, knicks have a decent draft, Immanuel quickley develop further, and either sign a couple of star players or sign a bunch of shooters because Randle either needs to be a #2 or 3 option, or if hes gonna be the number one guy, he needs a bunch of shooters to space out the floor. So he has more room to operate or kick it out to them."
It makes basically no sense to offer Julius a contract after these playoffs.   I have loved his improvement as much as everyone else. But when you have Obi Toppin around and Julius just had an outlier season...the smarter move is to trade Julius this year when his value is thru the roof.   But that's not a Thibs move; he loves his Vets and the Front Office seems ready to work with him.   So...you can bet on that extension happening.
"Thoughts: the Knicks are good on defense, they definitely were able to throw us off on offense this series. I think this next series is going to show that too.   Obi Toppin, Burks, and Quickley are good and are going to get better, the Knicks should use them more.   Our defense played a lot better than I thought they would. Outside of Game 2, McMillan has also made some really good adjustments and has coached pretty well."
"‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ HELP ME OBI ""1"" TOPPIN, YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§"
"Help me Obi Toppin, you're my only hope"
obi toppin
I disagree completely and as an honest Celtics fan I think it‚Äôs time we trade Tatum to the Knicks and build around Kevin Knox and Obi Toppin
"Were those legit rumors, or those lame fan sites being like ""Yo! Imagine trading Obi Toppin for Bradley Beal""?"
"Jordan poole has looked good.  looney is their draft pick.  steph, klay, draymond too.    kings are on the list but the real answer is the knicks.  obi toppin...not sold on him.  Barrett maybe.  knox sucks.  ntilikina sucks.  you had to trade KP because your team and front office sucks.  and no free agents want to go to the biggest market because the team and front office sucks so bad"
"How can you call this Knicks team young? All of their rotation guys aside from RJ Barret, Obi Toppin, and Quickley are 26+  Rose (32), Randle (26), Bullock (30), Burks (29), Gibson (35), Noel (27)"
Random comment but I feel like Obi Toppin is going to be good. He was an underrated part of why y‚Äôall‚Äôs bench was killing us in the first two games. I like him.
Obi Toppin: you are a bust and down 20+. Just stop.   *I type from my mom's basement*
Lmao why is Obi Toppin jawing at the Hawks bench down 20?!?
Help them Obi Toppin Kenobi.  You're their only hope.
&gt;Is it me or Obi Toppin looks like he‚Äôs built different?   üò§  &gt;Like he has no neck and a hunch back different  üê¢
Is it me or Obi Toppin looks like he‚Äôs built different?  Like he has no neck and a hunch back different
Is it a disadvantage for Obi Toppin to play without a neck?
"This free throw disparity thing is the dumbest story line of the postseason so far.  Any one who watched this game and actually understand the game of basketball knows that the refs were fair that game.  There was a lot of missed calls on both sides, nothing out of the ordinary.  The reason why there was a foul disparity is because of the way the hawks set up their defense.  They are focusing 2 guys (primary defender and capella) completely on randle, and always have a 3rd guy ready to help when he is on the move.  This has been drawing randle into his major flaw of his game (dribbling into traffic) and causing him to either pass out or take a wild shot/attack a bigger more athletic center.  Randle's major options to dump off to when he is being swarmed at is taj/injured noel, both of whom cannot play above the rim.  When the ball goes out, capela or the extra help defender has to over-commit late.  And since literally no one on the knicks besides obi toppin can play above the rim after Noel's injury, fouls tend to happen more than dunks or layups. Between randle and noel there was 20 of the 30 ft's, but no one is talking about how this swarming style of defense held the 2 of them to 3 made FG's, completely neutralizing the knicks entire offense.    The way the hawks played offense also contributed to their lack of FT's as well.  The knciks stout defense, predicated around having 2 elite shot blocker is completely dead with noel hurt and a 35 year old 6'9"" taj gibson as their starting center.  Half of the hawks points (55) came inside, and most of those shots were completely uncontested because of Noel being hobbled. Almost all of the rest of their points came from shooting 59% from 3.  The hawks didn't get a lot of foul calls, simply because they weren't taking any contested shots.  They were raining 3s and getting open looks after open looks under the basket.  It's hard to get fouls when you are getting a games worth of free opportunity.  Tldr (because salty fans won't read lets be honest) the hawks played a smothering type of defense extremely prone to committing fouls.  They committed fouls.  However in result, they completely trashed the knicks offense.  Please stop crying when things are working as designed."
"I would definitely say in the 16-19 range. A lot of this really depends on a team eyeing a specific player. For example: let‚Äôs say the Rockets had picks #23 and #24 in the 2009 draft and they really wanted to draft Jrue Holiday. They would instantly pull the trigger and trade those 2 picks to draft their guy at 17. (Jrue Holiday actually was drafted with the 17th pick by the way in 2009). But even if he was available at #20, the Rockets would still trade #23 and #24 to get Holiday if they felt a team would take him with picks #21 and #22.   The value of the picks also depend on how deep the draft is too. This upcoming draft is being hyped up to be one of the deepest drafts in decades. So it may be tough to try and snag the 15th pick in this draft with so much talent in the top 20. Teams may value the 15th pick higher than the 10th pick in last years draft. Btw last year the 10th pick was used to get Jalen Smith and the 8th pick was used to get Obi Toppin.   Sorry for the long post, I hope I made some sense."
Lmao Taj Gibson and Obi Toppin closing a playoff game over Randle and the Knicks might max the dude üòÇ
Obi toppin should never attempt a jumpshot
I need more Obi Toppin this game.  For better or worse.
"It would be an insult if Melos jersey was retired in New York.  Fun fact: If the Knicks made it to game 7 of the semifinals, Obi Toppin would have more playoff wins in a Knick uniform than Melo."

Just like how it's seemed obi toppin has much improved in his 3 point shot this season.

"Cries in Obi Toppin, laughs in IQ."
"Lottery guys are drafted on potential. How much potential does Caruso have as a 27 year old that‚Äôs literally in the perfect spot for his game? I also wouldn‚Äôt compare the contracts. Guys like Obi Toppin and Jalen Smith are making 4-6 million a year on their rookie deals, unless the cap literally doubles they won‚Äôt be making that much."
Exact my nuts on your face.   Here‚Äôs a lil obi toppin before u go to sleep: https://youtu.be/rL0507-re9o  Big 15 shit. U simply wouldn‚Äôt understand
Ain‚Äôt no Stoppin Obi Toppin
I like this list quite a bit better than what OP posted. I'd swap out Toppin and Jalen Smith though. I am not very high on Obi.
"Just this Year? Obi Toppin. I expected so much from him. But he's only played 11mpg, so cant really criticize when your coach dont play ya.  Cant really criticize Jalen Smith for the same reason, he wasnt given minutes behind a very very very deep bench.  But the award goes to the rookie that actually got minutes and disappointment goes to Killian Hayes and Deni Avdija"
"It's been overstated how bad he was, he had three things working against him: 1) Playing for a rookie-averse coach in Thibs, 2) Only playing the 4, and 3) Randle having the season of his life.  Toppin and Randle can't play together (hello, layup line) and Thibs wants to play Randle 49 minutes a night. Obi still finished well, his defense wasn't as bad as advertised. If he can clean up his 3 and avoid getting trigger happy when he makes his first one he can be a valuable bench piece."
A better version of this list  1 Timberwolves select Anthony Edwards  2 Warriors select Lamelo Ball  3 Hornets select Tyrese Haliburton  4 Bulls select Patrick Williams  5 Cavs select Isaac Okoro  6 Hawks select Killian Hayes  7 Pistons select Devin Vassell  8 Knicks select James Wiseman  9 Wizards select Onyeka Okongwu (honestly Wiseman and Okongwu could go either way)  10 Suns select Deni Avdija  11 Spurs select Aaron Nesmith  12 Kings select Kira Lewis Jr  13 Pelicans select Obi Toppin  14 Celtics select Jalen Smith
And obi toppin is?
"As a Knicks fan, is it wrong to say Obi Toppin?  He's super likeable and I absolutely love that he improved and he tries his hardest, but he was touted as one of the most NBA ready prospects.  He showed some 3-Point ability, but he's can't create his own shot yet and he also doesn't have a clearly defined role."
Obi Toppin and Payton Prichard.
When you draft Obi toppin over Halliburton you can‚Äôt really blame the draft over the GM
&gt;lemme just ignore the point entirely and invent a scenario in which this is about the idea of signing Obi Toppin to a big contract  epic moment
"You're gonna shit on Lonzo, Ingram, and Simmons while pumping Obi Toppin, Quickly, and Robinson lmfao  You don't trade a superstar and not blow it up, that doesn't even make sense"
I don‚Äôt think you realize OBI TOPPIN IS THE GOAT /s
"I really don‚Äôt think we should, everything I‚Äôve seen in trade scenarios makes me shake my head. I don‚Äôt want Obi Toppin in Cleveland lol."
"For some reason Knicks fans are infatuated with Obi Toppin and RJ. Which blows my mind because a package of both is still not close to good enough for Dame in my opinion.  And when Toppin and RJ underperform in the playoffs next season, everybody will be clowning NY when saying they could've had Dame (just like Harden and Miami with Herro)."
Drawing the line at a young unproven player like Obi Toppin is ridiculously stupid.
"I don't see it at all.  The problem is that the Knicks don't have any good draft picks.  All they have is their own and the Mavericks' picks, and it's unlikely any of those will even be lottery picks.   They could do RJ Barrett, Obi Toppin, another player to make it work financially, and like 4 first round picks, but since the picks aren't valuable ones, that probably isn't enough.  I personally think a trade with PHI (probably involving a 3rd team who is willing to send valuable young prospects/picks to POR) makes the most sensse.  PHI gets Lillard, POR gets prospects/picks, and a 3rd team gets Simmons (like a SAC)."
People were saying Obi Toppin and Kevin Knox  And some FRP were a decent package for Dame lol
"Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Hamidou Diallo, Obi Toppin, Taj Gibson or Mo Bamba"
"Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, and a first rounder sounds like the trade package every fan base puts together to acquire Lillard or something"
Definitely wouldn't call Obi Toppin a bust (yet).  He's barely had a chance and it's not because he played poorly.
"And losing our *only* source of getting a bucket for, what, Obi Toppin and Kevin Knox does what exactly??"
"This would be an aboslute steal for the Knicks - 2 players who will never crack the Knicks' starting 5 and a non-lottery 1st rounder for a 22 year old who scored a fairly efficient 24 ppg last year.    If I were the Cavs I'd hold out for something much better.  Sure Obi Toppin could end up being decent, but I don't think that's the best they can do.    I'd also much rather just hold on to Sexton than trade him for that package - even though Sexton + Garland will likely never work longterm."
"Obi Toppin is actually more legit than people give him credit. He really only gets 8 minutes of playtime since he cant share the floor with Randle. The only real downside is his versatility IMO. He is a PF and nothing else.   He's still an amazing rim runner, lob threat, PnR man and can space the floor. Like a poor mans John Collins"
Obi Toppin and Mavs first for Colin Sexton
"Obi Toppin definitely has potential.   Dude was just buried in the rotation, I feel like he could have a big breakout year with increased opportunities.   But yeah Sexton is worth more than that package."
So basically Obi Toppin and a first rounder?
I love Toppin but unfortunately we have a logjam at the 4 and he can‚Äôt share the floor with Randle. I still think Obi can be a good player.  I would do this trade in a heartbeat but seems like too small of a package.
Trading Obi Toppin after not even bothering to develop the guy. Just Knicks things.
"you can still get covid with the vaccine, i dont know about the other two but quickley was in a video with obi toppin getting his shot in may."
"Well to be fair, Obi was a 23 year old rookie who played 2 years in college. He was a lot less green than most lottery pick rookies are coming out of the draft. He wasn't a major part of the rotation because Thibs prioritizes defense, which Toppin is not very good at."
"Thibs usually isn't a coach who plays rookies, Obi Toppin didn't get a lot of run either. Pretty sure they only used Quickley because Elfrid Payton is trash  That said I wasn't impressed by Knox's offensive game last year"
Obi toppin he showed in the playoffs that he could really be a productive player his defense is not bad at all over the season he learned how to box out and improve his rim protection and three shooting   But over this off-season he need to work on his aggressiveness he‚Äôs to team friendly   Slashing - you would see him getting up so high to the point he could get a easy layup or just poster but he has absolutely no control over himself and the ball once he‚Äôs in the air  Handles - during the season he made some good drives but his handle was so weak that it put him in some terrible position to actually finish it
"Obi toppin looked better and better as the season went on and had a some really nice playoff min.   A full offseason with a Kenny Payne development plan along with a real summer league and training camp are gonna do wonders for the kid.   PT is gonna be a challenge with Randle being the star, but I expect Thibs will wanna take a few of his min away next season so those should go to Obi.   Not saying he is gonna be amazing or anything, but I think a lot of people are sleeping on him."
I hope Obi Toppin
It‚Äôs pretty damn easy    22-Julius Randle  23-Kevin Knox  24-RJ Barrett   25-Zion(when he‚Äôs a knick)  26-Julius randle again   27-Obi Toppin  28-Immanuel Quickley  29-Quickley again   30-Kyden Randle
Obi Toppin
"Seems like Obi Toppin is gonna be an obvious trade asset, especially considering he overlaps with Randle."
Reminds me Obi Toppin hate until he proved them wrong in the playoffs
Lillard for a pick swap and maybe Obi Toppin
Obi Toppin is also Evil Jayson Tatum lmao

"Idk if we can somehow keep a starting five of Dame, Bullock, RJ Barrett, Randle , and Mitch Robinson I think that‚Äôs way better than what Portland had this year.   Trading 2 first rounders in 2021, Quickley, maybe Obi Toppin and Kevin Knox. ü§∑üèºü§∑üèº"
"Obi ""Amare Stoudemire with a 3 point shot"" Toppin for DAME.  Straight up."
Knicks? They have a grip load of picks courtesy of Dallas and can toss RJ Barrett and Obi Toppin into the mix.
As the Knicks I protect  Julius Randle  RJ Barrett  Mitchell Robinson  Immanuel Quickley  Obi Toppin  Luca Vildoza   And since we'd have 8 or less under contract I'd put Kevin Knox as our unprotected pick

This kinda shit is why I wanted ATL to draft Obi Toppin. But Collins is actually better.
Obi Toppin

"hey Pelicans' fans, how does this sound: everyone of our picks + obi toppin for Zion??"
Gatland obi toppin all three ball brothers will improve miles Bridges. I think this year Zion and Ingram will both carry the peels to a first round exit but Zion is gonna put up record breaking numbers again this year. Also kinda hope ja and trae back up their playoff promise
I‚Äôm gonna make a prediction for 2020 and 2021 busts. I think it‚Äôs gonna Obi Toppin and Josh Giddey
"Knicks  2016 - no picks 2017 - Donovan Mitchell, Dillon Brooks 2018 - SGA, Mitchell Robinson 2019 - RJ Barrett 2020 - Obi Toppin, Immanual Quickley  I think this has been proof of how well the Knicks FO has done in the draft. I‚Äôd still take Obi over Halliburton because in the context of this prompt we wouldn‚Äôt need him.  SGA Donovan Mitchell RJ Barrett Obi Toppin Mitchell Robinson 6th man: Quickley"
"Brandon Roy is someone I mention because he went 6th, ahead of All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge, ahead of multiple high upside busts. But Roy was viewed, at the time anyway, as a can't miss starting quality player. He exceeded that obviously.  Very similar to what people were saying about Buddy Hield coming out of the draft. Who coincidentally also went 6th.  It's worth mentioning that NCAA player of the year winners have often amounted to very little, or sometimes nothing, in the NBA. Winners have included Tyler Hansbrough, Obi Toppin, Frank Mason, Frank Kaminsky, Jalen Brunson, etc. Lots and lots of guys that had zero business going 1st overall or even all that close to it.    Reddish has great shooting form and I always saw it as more of a decision making problem personally. I think he's going to figure it out and shoot a solid at least 34% eventually. He shoots over 80% from the FT line there's no way his 3 point percentage doesn't improve eventually."
"Projection is literally what the draft is.  If day 1 quality was all that mattered, Brandon Roy would have gone 1st. Buddy Hield would have gone 1st. Victor Oladipo goes 1st (good decision in this case). Marcus Smart might have gone 1st. Obi Toppin possibly goes 1st."
Obi Toppin  **WHUZ POPPIN**
You mean the dude who let Obi Toppin get buckets all over him?
Obi Toppin did it in college.
"Yes but with Quickley those minutes felt ‚Äúearned,‚Äù whereas with Obi it was a nice surprise he logged so many good minutes while Randle floundered. With that said, based on last season as a whole, it feels like Summer League was needed for Toppin, while it feels a little excessive for IQ."
Obi Toppin year 2.
‚ÄúAin‚Äôt no stoppin‚Äù Obi Toppin
Love Obi Toppin.  Also a big fan of Tre Jones who is showing out in SL
Obi Toppin. I'm so hype after summer league...
"OBI TOPPIN  6‚Äô9‚Äù with hops, good defense, and a wet 3"
Obi Toppin
"I believe the purpose of the summer league is to showcase the newly acquired draft picks; critique any problematic pieces of said draft picks while introducing them to the coaching style; and, seeing if any of the other than current draftees have improved during their player development. Off the top, I think of Bol Bol and Obi Toppin."
Also Toppin isn‚Äôt a big dude. Until Obi is able to get his own shot it‚Äôs gonna be tough. He‚Äôs the size of a wing but doesn‚Äôt really have that kind of game.
There‚Äôs no stopping Obi Toppin once he poppin off
"Not to mention that he was 19-22 in the years where he struggled to meet the opportunity. Lonzo is 5 months older than Obi Toppin. It's not weird at all for a PG to still be improving from 23-27. Nash was 27 when he made his first all star appearance, Lowry was 28. They just weren't considered underachievers from 20-25 because they weren't top 3 picks with loudmouth dads."

"i know what ur talking about the rumored trade package was picks 19 and 21 in this year's draft, obi toppin, kevin knox, and dallas's 2023 1st"
Obi toppin is the most coordinated uncoordinated person I‚Äôve ever seen
"The ""maybe"" isn't saying we might not have to offer them, it's saying that those players might be untouchable in the Knicks FO's eyes  Even without those players you're getting Noel/Burks (both moveable contracts who would certainly be traded for more assets for the Blazers), Obi Toppin, Miles McBride, Jericho Sims, Quinton Grimes, Mitchell Robinson (5 young players), and a LOT of picks. You can decide for yourself if the Blazers would take that (I wouldn't) but it isn't the most ridiculous package ever considering what Harden went for.  I would be shocked if we get Dame without moving one or both of RJ/IQ"
"some combo of:  Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks, RJ Barrett (maybe), Immanuel Quickley (maybe), Obi Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, any of our future picks, Miles McBride, Quinton Grimes, Jericho Sims  I don't think it beats the Sixers package if they offer Simmons + another player + picks"
Obi Toppin and RJ Barrett
"He was literally the most dominant player in the NCAA last year, and barely finished second to obi toppin the year before. He just doesn‚Äôt quite have the NBA athleticism that scouts are looking for, and his feet are noticeably slow on defense and in transition. I still think he has a place in the NBA, but that‚Äôs what kept him form being a lottery pick."
"Think of it this way he‚Äôs younger than Chris Duarte Obi Toppin, Cory Kispert, etc. There‚Äôs still a lot of upside with him, and he‚Äôs already a productive player as is.  If he doesn‚Äôt improve its basically the going rate for a sharpshooter anyways. But if he makes a jump it‚Äôs a steal"
"Thank you for asking!  (in no particular order)  PG - Curry, Simmons, Fox, Killian Hayes, Rubio  SG - Kelly Oubre, Jalen Green, Lavine, Booker, Oladipo  SF - Tatum, Giannis, Aaron Gordon, Abdul Nader, Hayward  PF - Kuzma, Kevin Love, Hachimura, Ibaka, Obi Toppin  C - Nerlens Noel, Robert Williams III, Rudy Gobert, Daniel Gafford, Jarrett Allen"
"I was like, but this guy has NBA minutes, then I remembered obi toppin does too. Speaking of the Knicks, sims killed it too, I don't think he missed any did he? We had some pretty crazy defense so it was impressive seeing him make buckets on us"

"Ok but Knicks have RJ Barrett, Mitchell Robinson, Immanuel Quickley, and Obi Toppin for basically that same amount. Soo‚Ä¶what are we really talking about here?"
"Im a photographer so I work with celebrities regularly. Basketball players I‚Äôve bet  Cole Anthony   I took photos of his draft party last year  Rudy Gay  I met him while setting him up for an interview at HypeBeast  Obi Toppin  A friend of mine knew him since he was a kid, is good friends with his father. I met him when he got drafted.   A few others but I got NDAs so I can‚Äôt reveal that yet"
"You could make an argument none of those guys would even play on the Knicks.  At best all would be spot minute guys.  You could make the case for Howard and maybe Melo or Ariza as a back up PF playing 10-15 minutes a game over Obi Toppin.  Bazemore and Ellington would be a 4th wing. With Quickley, Rose, and Kemba likely seeing some time at the 2 both of those guys would be our 3rd SF.  Nunn would of got some real burn (maybe even started) before getting Kemba Walker but after I have a hard time seeing where he would even play regular minutes on this roster. Nunn is a good player and a great signing. Howard is still very good for 20 minutes a night, but other than that not sure I would want any of those guys on the Knicks.  &amp;#x200B;  C Robinson   Noel  Gibson Sims  PF Randle Toppin Gibson Knox  SF Barrett Burks Knox Grimes  SG Fournier Quickley Rose Grimes   PG Kemba Rose Vildoza Mcbride"
I'm high on Obi Toppin. I think he is going to carve out a nice role in the NBA and having practically no offseason and then the calf injury set him back a bunch.   &amp;#x200B;  Lower on Cam Reddish than a lot seem to be. There were some hawks fans saying he's better than RJ which I just don't see.
"Derrick Rose, Immanuel Quickley, Alec Burks, Obi Toppin, Nerlens Noel.  That team would get a few wins against some starting lineups.  Its the Knicks, all day."
Obi toppin is just a shaved head away from being the captain of the all ninja turtle team
"I mean, Kevin Knox (over SGA), Frank Nktilina (over D-Mitch), Obi Toppin aside..."
Taj is a 3rd string center/power forward. Obi Toppin would come off the bench.
One Obi Toppin for Thaddeus Young please
Gonna play him ahead of Obi Toppin again?

"**Colby White** \- when he's moved off of PG and can just focus on his game as a scoring guard, I think he will surprise some folks.  **Collin Sexton** \- not 'given up' on, persay. People know he's talented. I think he'll be on the up and up though.  **Obi Toppin** \- I know he's a little raw right now, but he's athletic as hell and with a little more development time could be a very solid player.  **James Wiseman** \- bigs take long to develop. He's a raw prospect, he gotta brew. Has a lot of physical tools though. And even as a raw prospect, I've seen him drain threes and go coast-to-coast.  Other sleeper possibilities: Marvin Bagley, Luke Kennard."
meanwhile on the flip side i couldnt tell 23 year old obi toppin was on the court since he had no visible strengths or skills besides running up and down the court with his bricks for hips lol
Wish Obi Toppin is here in the draft.
"Obi Toppin, Jaxson Hayes, Collin Sexton, Frank Ntilikina, Marquese Chriss, Stanley Johnson, Nik Stauskas, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Terrence Ross, Brandon Knight...  Yeah, out of the last 10 Sexton is almost the only one who's turned into a really good player. Ross and KCP are tidy, but nothing special."
"I know you're messing around, but the entire scouting department is different save for the Toppin pick. Obi would have looked way better if Julius didn't go up a level, which the FO didn't predict. Despite his paltry averages, he grew on me a ton this year. Lots of high effort in the playoffs, and the kid is always working. Apparently he was following Julius around and asking so many questions it was getting annoying, all season long. Don't know what his place is on the team with Jules here, but I think he's solid. Would have loved Haliburton though of course.   Can't fault the IQ pick though, so not too bad."
Lmao must be how you feel looking at the shiny new franchise in your backyard taking all the good players and with the cool new arena... while you have Obi Toppin and westchester and JAMES DOLAN LMFAOOOOOOO
"Knicks get: KCP, Kuzma, and a 2nd-round pick               Lakers get: Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, and this year's 21st overall           &amp;nbsp;        If a trade falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"
"Alright, so if the pattern follows, Obi Toppin should be the 4th best player in the world."
Theo Pinson was obviously the key to the Knicks finishing fourth this season. Frank Ntilikina is better than Jrue Holiday. RJ is basically MJ. Obi Toppin and Kevin Knox are both better than Kevin Durant. Mitchell Robinson is basically Wilt.
"As recently suggested in the Cavs sub‚Ä¶ Collin Sexton, Kevin Love and Taurean Prince to the Knicks for RJ Barrett, Immanual Quickley, Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, and picks 19, 21, 32, 58 lmao."
Obi Toppin
"Giannis for Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, Pick 19  Who says no in this deal?"
"Knicks have Obi Toppin, Quickley and both of this years firsts on the table. Hopefully Giannis can move down to the wing and accept being the second option to Randle"
A perfect example of this is Obi Toppin. He averaged 20 ppg on 60% FG in college but can‚Äôt score in isolation at all against nba players.
What does Obi Toppin gotta do with this?
"Typically they didn‚Äôt have a good year or were under the radar, the year before. Or for example, Obi Toppin grew significantly in college. They‚Äôre so young that some guys just bloom late."
Obi Toppin NOT A PISTON.
I wouldn‚Äôt be talking about drafting when we drafted Obi toppin over Halliburton.
This team is much better than the 7-59 Bobcats... Edwards would carry this team to quite a few wins. I don't understand any of these comparisons.  rookie Kemba -&gt; Cole Anthony   Hendo -&gt; Dillon Brooks   Maggette -&gt; Markieff Morris   Diaw -&gt; Nic Batum (sorry too easy)   Biz -&gt; Biz (again... too easy)  DJ -&gt; Trey Burke   Higgins -&gt; whoever the worst SG in the NBA is right now   Reggie (holy shit I forgot he existed) -&gt; Denzel Valentine?   Mullens -&gt; tough one...  Kevin Love on nights when he really doesn't give a shit?   Diop -&gt; is Christiano Felicio still in the NBA?    Tyrus Thomas -&gt; Obi Toppin?    Matt Carroll -&gt; Steph Curry   Derrick Brown -&gt; Obi Toppin?   DJ White -&gt; pick a PF that's bad at everything and runs like he just shat his pants   Eddy Najera -&gt; Udonis Haslem
"Aaron Gordon, Rui, Obi Toppin"

"That was a great team. It‚Äôs too bad covid canceled March madness that year.   Jalen Crutcher, Obi Toppin,  Trey Landers, Ryan Mikesell, Rodney Chatman that was the best team UD ever had."
Obi Toppin did it in a college game   https://youtu.be/quYssL5je_s  Yeah I know that‚Äôs not nba neat though
Ooh. Seems kinda pointless using the Knicks for example Obi Toppin had a so-so season but with Randle balling out it would have been harder for him to get play time. So I think he should have played in the G-league (but still get his contract).
Obi Toppin!!!
That Cavs should trade their #1 scorer and Top 20 scorer in the League Collin Sexton to the Knicks for Obi Toppin (who the Cavs passed on the previous year in the draft) and some middling mid round picks.
The Obi Toppin alley oop was hype af
"RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley, Mitchell Robinson, and Obi Toppin is a pretty nice start‚Ä¶if Grimes and McBride have nice rookie years, the Knicks are in this convo next summer.    For now, in addition to the other teams mentioned already, I‚Äôll toss in Memphis‚Ä¶Morant, JJJ, Bane, Melton, Tillman, plus some other dudes just outside the 25-year old cap (Brooks, Clarke, Winslow). Not the best at the moment, but lots of potential."
I do like Obi Toppin.
Imagine how Knicks fans would act if they had a young talent like Barnes...  Instead y'all gotta pretend to like Obi Toppin :/
Definitely. We now have a ton of offensive firepower to surround him.  He couldn‚Äôt win a series by himself but now he has so much help.  Also our bench is nuts.  Between Mitch and Noel we have 48 mins of elite rim protection and between Kemba and Rose we have 48 mins of solid pg play.  Obi Toppin is taking a leap and he‚Äôs becoming a dangerous weapon off the bench. He immediately changes the pace of the game and he catches slower teams by surprise.
Add Obi toppin to MIP watch list  D rose should be #1 as 6moty as well
I fucking love this team. Obi Toppin is so fucking good. CARDIAC KEMBA FUCK YES
Toppin breakout szn  Knicks future looking good with RJ - Obi - IQ - Mitch
OBI TOPPIN' EMBIID
‚ÄúAin‚Äôt no stoppin‚Äù obi toppin might be the best great nickname/bad player combo in the nba
Obi Toppin
Obi Toppin is complete ass
Obi Toppin Year 2 is a different beast and it's only been 3 games
Obi fucking Toppin baby
Obi toppin.   And he won that dunk contest and everyone knows it.
Orlando‚Äôs favorite player is Obi Toppin

Obi Toppin just strikes me as the kind of guy who LOVES to have SEX !!...
"Gettin head from a jedi, call that Obi Toppin"
COCK LOCK AND ROCK RANDLE  SPANK EM WHILE THEIR DOWN ROSE  WHATCHYA DOING WITH ALL THAT ASS FORNIER  SLOPPY ‚ÄúOBI‚Äù TOPPIn  KISS YOU GOOD NIGHT WALKER  SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN BARRET  DOUBLE CHEEKED UP WITH THE PANTS HOG THIBEDEAU
Obi Toppin Real Name No Gimmicks
I swear our playoff run and Randle struggling against ATL was the best thing to happen to Toppin. Obi now has a little killer instinct!
AIN'T NO STOPPIN OBI TOPPIN
Whoever on the Celtics' coaching staff that thought it would've been a good idea to roll out a line up of Grant at the 5 and Brown at the 4 against Mitch Robinson and Obi Toppin needs to be removed from the arena
 Obi Toppin is really good
ayo Obi Toppin looking like a legit NBA player
**OBI MOTHERFUCKIN TOPPIN**
Obi fucking Toppin
OBI FUCKING TOPPIN
Let me put this j down and think about this. As a Knicks fan I'll try not to be too biased.  ROY - Q. GRIMES MIP - RJ BARRETT or Obi Toppin 6th man - D ROSE or IQ Coach - THIBS DPY - MITCHELL ROBINSON  MVP - J RANDLE  We're winning everything.  Book it. Not financial advice üòÜ
Obi Toppin continues to impress
My D Rose quickly when Obi started Toppin‚Äò
"minutes is ultimately going to be what stops obi toppin, he can only play the 4 and will be stuck behind randle. I think he‚Äôs going to be a lot better but he won‚Äôt have the stat increase people would think bc of the ceiling of potential minutes"
What about Obi Toppin?
"Obviously they had the best year since Melo was there, but I still don‚Äôt think the Knicks are in a great shape.   I look at their roster and just don‚Äôt see what their future is. I rate RJ Barrett more than anyone, I pretty much locked him as an all star from day one. While no doubt he will improve (as being so young as a slasher is almost impossible, how can he bash against teal me) just from general strength and his body being more mature, I still thought he would‚Äôve showed a bit more than he has. Thibs just seems to hate him. So while I expect improvement, he still needs to take that next leap.   Apart from RJ, who/what do they have? Obi Toppin? Quickley? Not much of a future there (even though Quickley had some nice moments last year) from what we have seen.  Randle had his best season, but does he keep it up or does he go back to his selfish ways if the knicks get off to a bad start? The rest of the roster is just literally role players.  They traded their best player in a deal they couldn‚Äôt of done any worse on. Dennis Smith Jr is currently playing for the blazers and had maybe 5 good games at the Knicks and they still aren‚Äôt a free agent destination.  So while it was absolutely awesome to see such an underdog team in a big market do well for the first time in forever, I just don‚Äôt see much brightness in their future right now. Things can change and I hope they do. Just not sold."
"The Knicks / Blazers combo would have worked best last year when we had ME7OOOOOOOOOOOOO  But uh, Obi Toppin should be on your notables list. That dude is GOOD."
"on what planet are they better than the knicks core? rj is better than wiseman in almost every way imaginable except height, poole is looking like he‚Äôs gonna have a breakout season, which means he‚Äôs been mediocre before, so how has he been better than mitchell robinson or quickley? obi toppin looks like he‚Äôs ready to break out, so feel free to put him in that mix.   kuminga and moody have played zero games yet, so can you really say that they‚Äôre better than kevin knox, who was a high draft pick and had a great first summer league before getting buried on the bench. so claiming that kuminga and moody have more growth potential than mcbride, quentin grimes, and jericho sims is unfounded."
Obi Toppin is not a bust and I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs on our team.  The skills we were promised actually do exist and I think he‚Äôs gonna surprise a lot of people.
Probably Obi Toppin. He still won‚Äôt be getting a ton of minutes behind Randle. But he looks infinitely more confident and competent than he did for most of last season.
Jayson Tatum is only a day older than Obi Toppin
Jayson Tatum (drafted in 2017) is a day older than Obi Toppin (drafted in 2020).
"As a knicks fans you should be well aware of how a coaching change can improve a teams win loss record.  Last year the Knicks were supposed to miss the playoffs and Randle was suppose to be a place holder for Obi Toppin.  In the end Randle became All NBA and the Knicks got the 4th seed.    If Green gets the buy in from the team and they play hard every night there is no reason they can‚Äôt be a solid playoff team.  I am not saying top 4 seed, but playoffs is achievable"
"If Obi Toppin starts yelling about how from his point of view the Jedi are evil, it might be time to be concerned."
"Come to think of it, have any of us ever really seen Obi Toppin and Anakin Skywalker in the same room?"
Anakin should talk to Obi (Wan) Toppin some more
Obi Toppin
I think Obi Toppin is a sith lord
"Honest guess;  Kevin Knox, Obi Toppin, Jalen Brunson, Zach Collins, Anfernee Simons"
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
"Knicks fans are like that too!  There are some fans who wouldn't trade Obi Toppin (and only Obi Toppin) for fucking Bradley Beal because ""how many times do we need to do that for you to realize, trading youth for experience has never worked, for any team, ever.  The only way to build a team is tanking and drafting well, there's literally never been a good team that wasn't built through tanking""."
I don't hate any current player (FMD) but I always get extremely frustrated watching Obi Toppin play. I don't feel good about it.
Obi toppin looks so New York it‚Äôs crazy lol
"obi toppin loves it when you have no center, dunk city"
No love for Obi Toppin?
I‚Äôll take the complement but I don‚Äôt think of any of our players as formidable.   *Except Obi toppin the star of my heart*
I forgot Immanuel Quickley existed for a sec and I thought you had come up with a new way to call Obi Toppin dumb lmao
"* We are a better team without Kemba Walker playing  * I love how the lineups were staggered, RJ plays so much better in a fast paced offense like the bench runs  * Quickley‚Äôs defense and playmaking are starting to catch up to his shooting and he may end up being the best point guard on the roster soon  * Alec Burks is a weapon off the bench  * Obi Toppin may be the most energetic big man I‚Äôve ever watched, and one of the best in-game dunkers too  * Quentin Grimes is gonna be a very good 3 and D guy, and Jericho Sims is gonna be a decent rim running center, our draft is looking very nice this year considering where these guys were picked  * Julius Randle is in his own head on offense sometimes, but he played very well defensively and his passing was very important. If he could just play with the energy that our bench does and let the game come to him instead of forcing offense through the low post, he‚Äôd be playing so much better"

Obi Toppin!
i love obi toppin
"Vogel iced Westbrook.  And man, the way my pessimism about various players has been panning out I should be an NBA talent scout. Randle is not that good.  Obi Toppin with the hard carry."
What's wrong with Harlan? Did someone fuck up his notes or was Marv's senility contagious? Obi Toppin was not the number one overall pick.
OBI TOPPIN
Obi Toppin
I'm always impressed whenever I see Obi Toppin. But I feel like Deni is playing really well too.
"Personally don‚Äôt think its fair to Okoro, Hayes and Deni to throw Obi in there. Toppin had the highest floor out of the bunch going into the draft. Due to the chaos that Covid caused on the NBA, you gotta expect the low floor, high ceiling guys to take a little longer to adapt, especially when they‚Äôre drafted by bad teams. Obi Toppin is Obi Toppin. He might get a little better, but as a whole, the player he is right now, is just who he‚Äôs always going to be."
Only thing i see here is that Obi Toppin should be getting alot more mins
"Obi Toppin, Deni Avdija, Isaac Okoro, Killian Hayes"
Obi Toppin
Sengun  Obi Toppin Dort OG Anunoby   those are some of first names that come to mind just off of their abilities
"I know I don't like Obi Toppin, and sometimes I'll forget why, watch him have a good game, and feel bad about it. This game is reminding me why."

"Lol look at your fans after winning one playoff game. Tried for years to tell everyone that Frank Ntilinka was going to be the next great pg. Kevin Knox was gonna be a superstar. Obi toppin was gonna win rookie of the year. The list goes on. Raptors fan base is young and don‚Äôt understand the game, so they say dumb shit sometimes. Knicks fans don‚Äôt have that excuse"
"Because hardcore Nets fans barely exist. I live in NYC and only know a handful of casual Nets fans, and all of them are Brooklyn natives who don't actually care about basketball they just cheer for their borough. I don't know a single hardcore Nets fan in person.  If you think about it, the Nets have only been in BK for 8 years. The oldest you could be and have actually grown up with them is like 16, maybe. How many young parents are turning their kids into Nets fans? That, or you're from Jersey. Example: Obi Toppin is 23, from Brooklyn, and a die-hard Knicks fans."
Obi Toppin is a great name - dude should start ice-cream franchise with great selection of toppings.
There‚Äôs no stoppin obi Toppin once he poppin off
Scottie Barnes/Patrick Williams/Deandre Hunter/JJJ/Josh Jackson   Franz Wagner/Obi Toppin/Jaxson Hayes/Collin Sexton/Frank Ntilikina
"Basically all takes about athleticism, a lot of people say Steph and Luka are ""bad athletes"", however they are really physically gifted. Athleticism is not just who jumps higher, is body control, endurance, acceleration, agility and stamina. How many players can move all over the court during the offense multiple times and still not be tired? I can only think about guys like Steph and Reggie Miller, and have you ever looked at Luka ability do accelerate and desaccelerate being a 6'7 fat guy? But if you ask to a casual, who is the better athlete, Obi Toppin(who have zero lateral quickness and almost none low body strenght) or Luka who they would chose?"
"Feels disrespectful to PJ. I've watched him a few times and never felt he was that good at defense.   Like the Knicks game it felt like he was just getting back door cut constantly by Obi Toppin.   Maybe his on ball defense is way better than his off ball D, but from what I've seen I'm not buying his defense yet"
Wheres obi toppin you fucking herb
An Ant Edwards/Obi Toppin/Miles Bridges dunk contest could be really special honestly
"I'm not an NBA guy. I went to UD and latched on to the Knicks because of toppin. I can't figure out the Knicks minute allotments. Every game Obi is screening, making cuts, and making his teammates better despite limited minutes and is typically a very efficient scorer yet he is always the last one off the bench and even in this game where the starters were benched an entire quarter he only got 15 minutes. So frustrating to watch"
[Julius Randle entered the game for Obi Toppin in a 93-93 game with 3:44 remaining. The Hornets went on an 11-3 run from there on out to close the win. Randle was a -30 in the second half.](https://twitter.com/_analyKnicks/status/1459347863889195013?s=20)  lol fuckin yikes

right you're being pedantic for no reason and missing the point on purpose  someone with OG's shot profile and usage rate and time on the court should be going to the line more often than guys like obi toppin or trey lyles who play very low minutes
"Obi Toppin, Tim Hardaway JR, Trey Lyles, Terrance Ross have shot more free throws than OG so far this season lol. OG is undoubtedly getting more contact than those guys‚Ä¶"
"I think the rotation just needs a shift, let Kemba come off the bench and D-Rose to start, play Obi Toppin for more minutes and let Randle have more rest, stuff like that"
"Worst defender in the league potentially, can only shoot threes, can‚Äôt create, and isn‚Äôt as athletic as most other small forwards.  Just isn‚Äôt a spot for a guy like him when we have people like obi toppin or burks who can do more than him"
"[https://www.reddit.com/user/brooklopezthedpoy/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/brooklopezthedpoy/posts/)  i've posted a lot of clips in the last 24 hours. if you're crying over ""obi toppin skies over giannis"" as a title i don't know what to tell you."

"**Knicks**  **Immanuel Quickly:** IQ, Jesus‚Äô Son  **Derrick Rose:** D Rose, Windy City D, Pooh, Every Rose has it thorn  **Julius Randle:** Beyblade, Big Julius, Don Julio, Orange (&amp;Blue) Julius, Randle wit da Handle,   **Taj Gibson:** Hard Hat, Lunch Pail, Taj Gibson  **Kemba Walker:** K Walk, MJs Son  **RJ Barrett:** Baby Face Barrett, Hesi-Step-back-pull-up-Maple, StarJ,   **Alec Burks:** Alec Tre-Bruk,   **Obi Toppin:** Obi Wan,   **Evan Fournier:** French Phenom, French Toasty,"
"I'm inlove. Bought a Kemba jersey with plans to also get an RJ jersey when they start selling the city edition ones. RJ really stepped up, Kemba is playing good, Fournier is exceeding my expectations, D Rose is solid a piece in NYC once again with new and inproved 3 point percentage. Randle is showing that last season wasn't a fluke and Obi Toppin is actually contributing to the winning effort."
Obi Toppin looked lost in the third and early fourth. No Fournier in the 4th? Quickley reluctant to shoot? Centers no where to be found in the paint when raptors ran small ball? Smh
"quickley has regressed a bit this year but obi toppin has definitely gotten better, he's like the ideal backup PF"
"idk what that guys is talking about. Knicks starting 5 is nothing special when comparing with other playoff teams.   Where the Knicks are strongest is they have one of the strongest bench units in the league. Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Obi Toppin, Immanuel Quickley, Nerlens Noel (once he comes back from injury). Knicks bench regularly scores 40-50 points a game between them."

 Obi toppin? Horford? Eubanks? Bagley? I feel like most of these guys are attainable
