Rick Mahorn (currently 62) and Sekou Doumbouya (turned 20 in December).
random thought but everytime i see sekou doumbouya i read i think ali bomaye
"A ton of 1st round picks that are on the younger end of the spectrum spend a lot of time bouncing up and down between the 2.   For the Pistons last year, Sekou Doumbouya was the youngest player in the entire NBA. He had and still has his flashes of ability, but at 18 years of age he found himself losing confidence and had difficulty adjusting to the NBA style of play. When he went to Grand Rapids for a few days at a time, he played extremely well and learned how to play NBA ball just a little better.   If there was a regular G League season again this year, both him and Killian Hayes would be going back and forth to help them grow faster. Instead we're a little marooned and while Killian is injured Sekou has to learn in real time."
Sekou Doumbouya
"I think his point is that the BKN FO has proven itself competent enough that -- unlike the post-LeBron Cavs -- the Nets likely wouldn't become a total dumpster fire even if all the stars left in their option years. BKN would find some sneaky solid guys in the G League; eat some salaries of guys who are still OK, just overpaid; get some picks that way and get some decent draftees; be well-coached; be in the East; etc., the end result being that they'd suck, but they'd suck in a 12th-pick-in-the-draft way rather than being a favorite for one of those guaranteed top 5 spots. So HOU ends up coming out of it with a Sekou Doumbouya, a Jaxson Hayes, a couple Ty Jeromes, and a Mfiondu Kabengele... for James fucking Harden."
Ah yes the Sekou Doumbouya
I mean tbf he made Sekou Doumbouya delete a picture off IG where he was getting roasted for his bald spot. Not hating just thought it was funny.

"Wood last year only saw the court 25 min/game, and was stuck behind or sharing minutes with Drummond, Griffin, Morris, and even Sekou Doumbouya. That feels more like coaching misconduct than front office troubles."
"Mostly agree, BUT he's only played 2000 minutes in the NBA, and only averaged 21 min/game last year, and averaging \~10 min in a few games in earlier years. He was stuck behind Drummond and Griffin on the depth chart, and somehow they even gave similar minutes to Sekou Doumbouya and Markeiff Morris at the 4/5 slots. In retrospect, it looks like disastrous coaching."
"I've been noticing this for some time. It certainly seems to have become fashionable for a lot of guys to execute their dunks in as plain and routine of a way as possible.   It's hard to argue with guys just wanting to get the job done while utilizing minimal energy and creativity (this is likely big among the ""dunk is only worth two points"" crowd) but as a fan, I totally miss when guys seemed like they were dying to show what they could do to the rim when given the opportunity.   /u/honditar already mentioned so many, but it's pretty wild in hindsight to think back to how many entertaining dunkers there were just a bit over a decade ago.   * Vince Carter  * Kobe Bryant  * Jason Richardson  * LeBron James   * Desmond Mason  * Ricky Davis  * Tracy McGrady  * J.R. Smith  * Stromile Swift  * Steve Francis  * Baron Davis  * Kevin Garnett  * Darius Miles  * Amar'e Stoudemire  * Richard Jefferson  * Gerald Green  * Josh Smith  * Chris Andersen  * Dwyane Wade  Today's game is obviously still amazingly skilled and we're seeing shooting like we've never seen in NBA history but as a lifelong mega fan of the dunk, yeah, I miss it.   As an isolated example, tonight 20-year-old Sekou Doumbouya broke out into the open floor for a completely wide open fast break opportunity. Could have been a windmill, reverse, 360, or even just an emphatic one-handed hammer. Instead, we got slow motion skip step and one of those layup line drop-ins. And again, from a basketball game standpoint, that's totally fine (nice for Sekou to score either way) but I miss the funk."
Uh oh. My Pistons drafted Sekou Doumbouya with hopes he would become the next Pascal Siakam!
"- OG is not playing well - Jared Culver playing better but league probably doesn't believe it - Markannen has been totally acceptable but he doesn't seem as threatning as before - Devonte Graham has been atrocious on my fantasy team, so many 0-5 games already - Sekou Doumbouya and Killian Hayes have not played well - Mo Bamba virtually has no stock right now - Malik Monk virtually no stock - Dennis Smith Jr has no stock - Westbrook better turn the W's around, about to destroy his rep permanently - Literally nobody believes in Wiggins now - honestly James Harden's trade stock is unbelievably low for what he is - Nobody would pay much for D'lo Russell rn - No prospect on the Bulls for that matter has much value, though all 'should' be good. Don't get that team."
"Based on what I've seen of Wood this year, it seems criminal he played fewer mpg than Griffin, Drummond, markeiff Morris last year, and pretty much the same minutes as Sekou Doumbouya. Hard to understand how he's the 4th or 5th option at the 4/5 positions there."

"In my opinion, it's kinda a win-win for Detroit.   Not only are they significantly better without him on the floor, but his absence will create far greater opportunities for young players like Saddiq bey and Sekou Doumbouya. His presence on their roster has been suffocating for the development of the young talent."
"we have two young french dudes, Killian Hayes or Sekou Doumbouya?"
Saddiq Bey	  Mason Plumlee	  Isaiah Stewart	  Jerami Grant	  Josh Jackson  Sekou Doumbouya  Wayne Ellington	  Saben Lee    Frank Jackson     Dennis Smith Jr.
"I think it's a pretty sure thing that you're not getting Grant. If you're getting anything, its some combination of Delon Wright, Wayne Ellington, and or Sekou Doumbouya"

"yeah you're right I'd rather have two first round exits in the last decade and have to hope for Sekou Doumbouya to pop. Also wtf are you talking about, look at the DNPs for the Pistons tonight and tell me they're not positioning for the draft (as they should be)"
"I see his VORP as 0.7 which actually ranks him in the top 113 out of 524 total players.  Anthony Edwards ranks 519 out of 524 which is interesting. The only players below him are Sekou Doumbouya, Isaac Okoro, Dwayne Bacon, Rodney Hood, and Theo Maledon."
"For the Pistons: Killian Hayes, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Sekou Doumbouya and Isaiah Stewart"
"I could not listen to Nate Duncan anymore after every analysis of a bad or mediocre 2019 draft pick ended with some version of ""and they could've taken someone like a Sekou Doumbouya"" (4 PPG, 35% FG for those wondering how the take is aging at this exact moment)"
Sekou Doumbouya has star potential and Dwane Casey is the one holding him back.
"Some guys I was REALLY high on at recent Celtics draft positions:  -  * 2020, Pick #26: **Tyrell Terry** – got Payton Pritchard instead  * 2019, Pick #14: **Sekou Doumbouya or Goga Bitadze** – I'd still take either over Romeo Langford but none are really blowing up the league  * 2017, Pick #1: **Markelle Fultz** – got Jayson Tatum instead  * 2016, Pick #3: Take **Dragan Bender** or trade down and get **Jakob Poeltl** – got Jaylen Brown instead  * 2014, Pick #6: I thought **Noah Vonleh** was the new Chris Bosh – got Marcus Smart instead"
Didn’t want to steal the Finals MVP from Sekou Doumbouya.
"After adjusting LeBron James' stats, removing outliers to project the future, he heavily regresses to around the level of  2020 Sekou Doumbouya."
"Wrong on:  * Anthony Edwards. I thought he was a really good prospect, but the shot making he showed in the second half of the season was really impressive and ahead of schedule IMO. * Sekou Doumbouya. He's still a very young prospect, but after two years he hasn't improved as much as I would have hoped. I thought he had super high potential coming out of the draft but so far he hasn't shown much.  * Grant Williams. I wasn't as high on him as some other draft people were, but I didn't expect to just be flat out terrible.  Right on:  * Jarrett Culver. Great college player but I never understood why he was such a high pick. He's an inefficient jump shooter and he's not athletic/explosive enough to be a great finisher. His offensive strengths (passing/ball handling) aren't very valuable unless his scoring is good enough to be an on-ball threat. By all accounts, he sounds like a great dude and hard worker so I do hope he proves me wrong in year three though. * James Wiseman. He looked really raw which I expected. I still think he has high potential moving forward, but I was not surprised that he was a net negative as a rookie. This one is a major TBD though because he could make huge leaps moving forward. * Desmond Bane. I'm a biased Grizzlies fan, but Bane has been really damn good this season. He's older so his potential is lower than most picks, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's someone who averages like 19/4/4 in his prime."

It’s Sekou Doumbouya dunking on Tristan Thompson
Some other \#15 picks in recent years:  2014 Adreian Payne  2015 Kelly Oubre Jr.  2016 Juan Hernangómez  2017 Justin Jackson  2018 Troy Brown Jr.  2019 Sekou Doumbouya  2020 Cole Anthony  I knew very little about any of these guys before they were drafted. The one guy who I had seen some of was Justin Jackson because of the ncaa championship.
"Rodney Hood, Sekou Doumbouya, Chasson Randle, and Aleksej Pokusevski all ranked worse in BPM in more minutes and about a fifth of the league ranked worse than him in RPM (without considering minutes cutoffs etc).   I'm biased because I love the guy but that's not the worst player in the league. He was bad (as a lot of rookies are, even those who go #2 overall) but will definitely improve"
No one believes in Sekou Doumbouya?
2020 pistons to 2021 pistons. We've kept 1 player from last year (Sekou Doumbouya). Everyone else is new
"He’s a project pick, you’ll need to give him at least 2-3 years until he’s a legit NBA starter. Reminds me of Sekou Doumbouya. His body is NBA ready but he needs a lot of work on his basketball skills"
"As a Pistons fan I finally have players that I want to keep around lol. As many suggested before, I would probably move the number down to 6 simply because so many teams don’t have 8 great players to keep around.  (2020-2021 roster) 1. Killian Hayes 2. Isaiah Stewart  3. Saddiq Bey 4. Mason Plumlee  5. Jerami Grant 6. Hamidou Diallo 7.  Sekou Doumbouya 8. Saben Lee  Obviously 1-6 isn’t in really any order, but keeping the starters and all one of the better bench players we’d be fine. Sekou would probably be taken due to potential, but it’d also depend on who else is taken. I don’t believe Saben Lee would be taken due to being a solid rookie but not great enough to warrant being picked."
"I mean, Pistons potential roster in 2-3 years:  G/W Killian Hayes  G/W Cade Cunningham  W/F Jerami Grant  W/F Saddiq Bey  F/C Isaiah Stewart   Bench:  G/W Hamidou Diallo  G Saben Lee  W/F Deividas Sirvydis  W/F Sekou Doumbouya   Plus any other draft picks or FA signings. I like that roster, tbh"
"Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee  Corey Joseph, Josh Jackson, Hami Diallo, Sekou Doumbouya, Isaiah Stewart  Is this likely what you guys will look like? Or do you think a few players might be moved? Ala Plumlee and Joseph."

"Mirotic's contract with Barcelona was for 6 years and $79 million and he signed it before Covid. Covid is why he took such a big paycut the following year. Not disagreeing with the rest of your points, but I'd still like to know about which exact players somebody's talking about when they're supposedly better than some NBA players. I think the figure is 90-95%, and not necessarily higher than 95%.  I have trouble believing that Mo Bamba would have a good career with Real Madrid, or that James Wiseman would be a whole lot better with Fenerbahce. Here's a short list of Eastern Conference players currently with contracts for 2021-22 who I don't think should be in the NBA:  1. Udonis Haslem  2. Devin Cannady (Magic)  3. Mo Bamba  4. Cassius Winston (Wizards)  5. Nick Richards (Hornets)  6. Sam Merrill (Bucks)  7. Kelan Martin (Pacers)  8. Sekou Doumbouya  9. Cory Joseph  10. Kevin Knox  11. Jabari Parker  12. Paul Reed (Sixers)  13. Sam Dekker  I'm sure there's a few more in there."

"Sekou Doumbouya is still only 20, and I believe he will figure it out because he is too much of a physical beast to not have an impact in the future. His BBIQ is still too bad but he can turn into a decent, shawn marion type of player"

"Frank Ntilikina, Sekou Doumbouya, and soon Killian Hayes. So many questionable picks from France"
"I mean, let's pump the brakes a little bit - Sengun went against defensive juggernauts Sekou Doumbouya and Luka Garza last night, after besting the terrible twosome of Banks and Kabengele on Sunday.  Granted, he has looked very good. But let's wait and see how it plays out in the regular season with guys that are actually pro-ready centers."
"Theo Maledon, Killian Hayes, Sekou Doumbouya, Victor Wembanyama, Rudy Gobert."
The real french connection is Yabusele and Sekou Doumbouya touching cheeks
"Nope Detroit has 7   Cade Cunningham, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Jerami Grant, Sekou Doumbouya, Saben Lee, and Isaiah Stewart."
Sekou Doumbouya averaged 20 ppg at 19 years old in the g league too. Whats your point? (Obviously Green will be better than Sekou im just saying that line of reasoning seems kinds faulty).
"With one pick to come, here's how Detroit's young roster now looks:  **PG:** Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee.   **SG:** Hami Diallo, Josh Jackson.  **SF:** Saddiq Bey.  **PF:** (Jerami Grant), Sekou Doumbouya.  **C:** Isaiah Stewart."
Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin were more important than Kennard a year ago. And if you’re talking about the best prospect than Sekou Doumbouya and Bruce Brown were better assets I’d say.
"* Prestige of being a #1 pick.  * Solid young talent with no pressure to win immediately.  * #1 pick will make $4.5M more than the #2 pick over the course of the rookie contract.  I'd rather grow next to Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Sekou Doumbouya, Jerami Grant (and lots of cap flexibility) than wait out the John Wall/Eric Gordon cap-space-blackhole backcourt in Houston."

"Yeah but a lot of guys put up high scoring numbers in the g league, Sekou Doumbouya's g league stats are very similar to Jalen Green's, and Doumbouya averaged 5 ppg. Obviously Green is better than Sekou, but 24 just doesnt seem likely, at least not on great effiency."
Frank Ntilikina / Dennis Smith Jr / Kevin Knox / Sekou Doumbouya / Harry Giles
"Patty Mills, Paul Millsap, Lamarcus Aldridge, James Johnson, Javon carter, D’andre bembry, Sekou Doumbouya, Cam Thomas, Day’ron sharpe, Kessler edwards is a massive upgrade on Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Alize Johnson, Luwawu-caberet, Reggie Perry"
"Sekou Doumbouya looks like a big mess. A great talent but a deplorable mental state. Not a huge worker either.  In short, he won't last long in the NBA.  The saddest thing here is that these behaviors were already visible in France when he played in Poitiers in the second division or in Limoges in the first division.  He was capable of great performances but had no consistency. One game he would score 20 points and the next he would finish with 2 points having been absent the whole game.   That's an unforgiving problem in the NBA."
Maybe Sekou Doumbouya isn’t even his real name. In a twist of irony he’s real age is 23 and his real name is Fausto Carmona
"But they say Thon Maker, Serge Ibaka, Sekou Doumbouya, Bismack Biyombo are. I wonder why."
"And an extra roster spot. As dumb as it is to say, Doumbouya didn't really fit with Detroit anymoe despite the fact he was drafted only 2 years ago.   I was extremely disappointed in just about everything having to do with Sekou anyway, so it's whatever to me."
"Nets Big Man Depth:  KD  Griffin  Claxton  Aldridge  Millsap  Bruce Brown (he’s used as a PG/C)  James Johnson  Sekou Doumbouya  De’Andre Bembry  Jahlil Okafor  Day’Ron Sharpe  That’s arguably 6 starting caliber bigs and 8 overall rotational bigs on the roster (Sekou, Bembry, Sharpe, and Okafor combine to be 1 rotational big). Sounds pretty good to me."
"It’s unfair the Nets traded one nasty poster dunker putting his balls in dude’s faces, for another in [Sekou Doumbouya](https://youtu.be/HS78dffWoVI)"
"Nets prolly have no frps, 4 second rounders and we get a free roster spot.  For Sekou Doumbouya a guy we gave minutes (20 mpg his rookie season, 12 mpg his 2nd year) but still doesn't show out. We already have a bigger project in Killian we don't need Sekou who will be struggling to find minutes"
Not for Sekou Doumbouya bro
"Sekou ""Ben Simmons"" Doumbouya"
"&gt;Why is having a “lack of intensity” the same as being lazy?   Here's more from the same media session about effort:  &gt;""The intensity, the effort has got to come from our young guys, and he’s one of our young guys. He’s getting the opportunity... you’re gonna make mistakes in this league as a young player, but lack of intensity shouldn’t be one of them and lack of passion. Take advantage of the opportunity cause it’s fleeting""  https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2020/2/12/21134374/sekou-doumbouya-has-hit-the-rookie-wall-hard"
Sekou Doumbouya breakout season incoming in the next two seasons.
&gt; I thought Detroit was high on Doumbouya  We were also high on Luke and Bruce :(. Weaver just isn't interested in trying to build with anyone else's pieces. He gave Sekou a year to earn a long term spot and he just really didn't show out so here we are
"Especially the team affiliation of DeAndre Jordan, Jahlil Okafor, and Sekou Doumbouya."
A 2nd rounder could be anything! Even Sekou Doumbouya!
Yeah for **Sekou Doumbouya**
I have never heard of Sekou Doumbouya
"OP with 4 absolutely terrible posts now in 2 days  &gt;Can Killian Hayes be useful?  ...he's 20  &gt;Eric Bledsoe is still really good  Enough said  &gt;Will Sekou Doumbouya be waived by the end of the season?&gt;He made no progress from year 1 to 2 and still remained one of the worst players in the league, is it over for him?  Is it over for a 20 year old?    &gt;How many people actually call Ron Artest ""Metta World Peace""? &gt;I don't see anybody actually calling him that, I always went with Ron Artest, it's well established and rolls off the tongue well.    The reason that is a stupid post is Ron Artest's name is Ron Sandiford-Artest and he hasn't been Metta in years"
"Regarding Sekou Doumbouya, it may not last much longer, as the Pistons may have the will to get rid of him.  The potential is there, but the mentality of the player is clearly deplorable."
Sekou Doumbouya    Ben Simmons    LeBron James
Dr. Doom for Sekou Doumbouya is pretty good.
Why would they dump Sekou Doumbouya? It's way too soon.
&gt; Sekou Doumbouya  6'8 with 7 foot wingspan you say? masai is alredy calling
"Other possible discussions:  “What if we started Dwight, DJ, AD, LeBron, and Sekou Doumbouya?”  “It would probably be bad.”  “Yeah, I guess.”"
Sekou Doumbouya will get plenty of opportunities due to load management of that ancient roster.
"Sort of weird to sign Sekou Doumbouya, who was basically discarded by the Pistons, Nets, and Rockets, only to waive Joel."
Just doesn't make sense not to unless the player is bad and with bad attitude.    Sekou Doumbouya got his 3rd year option picked up but he still got waived some weeks ago. He is in a two way contract with the Lakers so he may still play his 3rd season but technically not due to the 3rd year option. He still got paid I am sure.  Not lottery but Zhaire Smith was the 16th pick and didn't get his 3rd year option picked up. I know he almost died but at the same time he did play at the end of his rookie season and had a couple nice games. Wonder what the hell happened there for the Sixers complete lack of interest.
Imagine getting waived to make room for Sekou Doumbouya.
"He’s been wrong about a lot of things. Like saying Simmons was gonna be traded on draft night, OKC offered SGA + 6 for the #1 pick, Dinwiddie to the Clippers, Sekou Doumbouya is older than 20 … etc.   He’s certainly not ‘gospel’ like Woj or Shams, often times he’s a mouthpiece for FO’s to spread their agendas."
"https://www.spotrac.com/nba/houston-rockets/sekou-doumbouya-31572/  &gt;Traded to Brooklyn (BKN) from Detroit (DET) with Jahlil Okafor for DeAndre Jordan, $5.78 million , 2022 2nd round pick [BKN pick] , 2027 2nd round pick [BKN pick] , 2024 2nd round pick [WAS or MEM pick (more favorable)] and 2025 2nd round pick [WAS or GSW pick (more favorable)]  it's 'cause Brooklyn _really_ wanted to get DJ off their books."
I read somewhere that they're just waiving him so they have a roster spot for sekou doumbouya from the nets in the trade yesterday then they're gonna waive sekou so they'll probably claim him off waivers after they claim sekou (they're 1st in the waiver claim order)
"Sekou Doumbouya is the prototype of the ultra-talented player who will not be able to make a career in the NBA because of a bad mentality and a very poor work ethic. Talent is important, but there is no substitute for a strong work ethic and motivation to succeed.  I have a good example in mind here with Alex Caruso. He is not as talented as some in the NBA but his motivation to progress, his work ethic, and his intelligence in understanding his role have made him indispensable.  Doumbouya is not capable of that. He will return to Europe and probably France.  But if he doesn't change his mindset, he will have a hard time making a long-term professional career even in France."
"Their 12 would be:   Corey Kispert, Cole Anthony, Sekou Doumbouya, Troy Brown Jr, Justin Jackson, Juancho Hernangomez, Kelly Oubre Jr, Adreian Payne, Giannis Antetoukounmpo, Mo Harkless, Kawhi Leonard, Larry Sanders.   So something like Anthony, Oubre Jr, Kawhi, Giannis, Hernangomez - Brown Jr, Kispert, Harkless, Jackson, Sanders - Payne, Doumbouya."
"Sekou Doumbouya is probably better than Jared Dudley for team D, though that's not really saying a ton and not like team D really needs more help lol"
"Nets have some young guys I’m excited to see. I really like Dayron Sharpe, Sekou Doumbouya, Cam Thomas, David Duke, Kessler Edwards, and obviously Nic Claxton. I might be missing someone but they have really exciting young players you’ll see tomo"
"Bruce Brown, Jevon Carter and Sekou Doumbouya are the highest paid available players"
Super athletic dude without the technicals to match.   There’s plenty of these in every draft. Sekou Doumbouya is a similar case.
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
the guy is a bad help defender lol. he’s ok on ball but he looks lost out there. It’s crazy because if you watched his film you could see he literally didn’t excel at a single basketball skill to a NBA level. Huge whiff of a pick. But this is the same FO that picked Sekou Doumbouya so i guess it’s expected. Saben Lee is better and should start over him.
"Just look at the other names on the list. I'm on here every day and watch nba games literally every day and play fantasy every year.   I have no idea who Jay huff, Sekou Doumbouya and Kessler Edwards are. Obviously defensive win shares has some glaring flaws."
He reminds me of if Sekou Doumbouya was good
Half the people here who aren't Pistons fans are convinced Sekou Doumbouya is a blue-chip prospect
I’m gonna save you the time - no.  I am so relieved that I have been able to watch this season of Pistons basketball and not try to convince myself that I see something promising in Sekou Doumbouya.
LOL who is Sekou Doumbouya
"Why is Malik not starting when LeBron is out? Why did he get only 14 minutes and Bazemore who clearly had nothing gets 22 minutes? Why is Jordan getting any minutes at all? What the fuck rotations are these? They are better off finding any random G-League stiff to stick at C. They need to get rid of these old farts. I have no idea who Sekou Doumbouya is, but I bet he would have put in more effort on defense than 8 of these guys combined."
