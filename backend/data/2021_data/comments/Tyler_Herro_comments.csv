White teens make racist jokes about Black people not being able to swim. I didn’t say this Tyler Herro situation was caused by white teens on the internet.

"If we’re a bum team why do we got a better record than you? 😭   We’ve dealt with COVID &amp; injuries too.. so what’s your Teams excuse?   Y’all just suck  Have fun reliving the bubble playoffs while y’all get bounced in the first round.. if y’all even make it 😂  And by the way we got a plethora of assets and lottery picks, y’all could’ve had him too and made the playoffs  But I forgot heat fans are delusional  and think Gordon Dragix &amp; Tyler Herro will lead them to the finals 😂  Y’all got lucky in the bubble, not happening again. Imagine bragging about going to the finals with no fans 😂"
Tyler ‘Bubble Legend’ Herro....?
"Yes because the rockets only wanted Herro for mvp winner James Harden 🤡🤡 you're a casual  [The Rockets asking price from Miami for James Harden included Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Precious Achiuwa, Kendrick Nunn, two first-round picks, and 4 pick swaps.](https://twitter.com/LegionHoops/status/1349806703513100292)"

On the bright side at least they didn’t give up Tyler Herro for James Harden right ?
I like Tyler Herro a lot but man he got absolutely abused in OT. Twice by Hayward on back-to-back possessions and then Graham hit the dagger 3 over him.
Hayward deserves every fucking penny from that contract. Took tyler herro to school during OT. All star szn.
"Malik Monk with ~~cocaine~~ ice in his veins, Jimmy Butler finally missing a game winner against us, Devonte/Gordon exposing Tyler Herro. Couldn't have asked for a better way to end a game against the Heat. WE STREAKING BABY!"
Tyler Herro benched for Avery Bradley??
haha hey remember when we were one pick too late to get Tyler Herro last year  no reason
"Tyler Herro is better right now though, maybe not for long"
"Uh Giannis isn’t bad in the playoffs. Career 25 ppg even though he was shit to start his career, and he the only reason Goran Dragic/Tyler Herro/Duncan Robinson/Jae Crowder were killing us rather than Bam or Jimmy on defense."
"RJ is shooting open threes and bricking shots and has less than half the attempts to Tyler. if you think they're anywhere near the same level at shooting because they have the same 3 pt % fifteen games into the season, you're clearly delusional. Just look at Herro's stats last season and what he did in the playoffs at the highest level. RJ is probably a better defender, but he's league average at best. They are probably equal in playmaking. So I think Herro comes out on top bc of his shooting."
He looked up to Tyler Herro growing up
"to be fair, Tyler Herro is better. At least until RJ develops a 3pt shot."
"Half this sub said he was a bust and that Tyler Herro was better, I’ll never forget."
"Harkless isn’t an improvement. Avery is basically a wash with Jae (good D, unreliable O). Herro/Duncan will slightly improve (we didn’t have a real offseason for real improvement, you can see Duncan and Tyler are pretty similar right now to the playoffs).  Precious is doing nicely but it’d be pretty insane we’d have a rookie drafted in the teens contributing majorly two years in a row."
"Tyler Herro says he has the plague, isn’t sure if he will have to quarantine"
Tyler Herro is another one. Something about him really bridges the gap between high class and low class
Tyler Herro says he has tested positive. He isn’t sure if he will have to quarantine.
Trae Young and Tyler Herro are probably better comparison since I know a bunch of people were acting like Herro was the better shooter  last season because of a higher 3pt%.  &amp;#x200B;  Call me bias cause I probably am but if you actually watch the shots Trae takes and regularly makes compared to the shots Herro is getting its night and day whose better.
tyler herro renting a room somewhere
Can I just remind ya'll that Lonzo fucking ball and Tyler Herro were listed as better than Derozan and Lamarcus?
I want Beal on the Nugs so bad  That Miami Heat package is atrocious though...Tyler Herro wayyyyy overvalued.
"I watched it. Reggie called a timeout at the end of the game with less than a minute left when the Heat players were trying to intentionally foul him to send him to the line, but the Clippers didn't have any timeouts left. Chris Webber did the same thing in the 1993 NCAA National Championship game and his team went on to lose. Reggie was beating himself up after calling the TO and his teammates were trying to console him and I guess he was just feeling really anxious/down on himself and was expressing it to Serge physically while Serge was trying to talk him down. The game was pretty close and because of Reggie calling the TO they didn't have, Tyler Herro got to take a free throw and tightened the Clippers' lead. The Clippers ultimately won, but it could've gone very differently"
"Jimmy Butler has only played 4 full games and Tyler Herro has missed multiple games as well, outside of that other players like Bradley have missed time as well."

"Tyler Herro. Came back after being out for 2 weeks, played amazing and was a huge factor in the 4th quarter tonight that almost allowed Heat get a comeback victory"
"Whos the white Tyler Herro in the nba, austin rivers?"
"This is obvious sarcasm, but to ignore that the Heat was a team that HEAVILY benefited from the bubble last year by not having to play road playoff games with rookies, it's disingenuous. Miami is more likely to miss the playoffs than to ever replicate their bubble success.  There was Heat fans in this sub saying that they shouldn't have offered Tyler Herro and a package for James Harden, which is the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen, they are trying to be the '04 Pistons, but without being the greatest defensive squad of all time."
Tyler Herro seems like the type to like a crowd tbf
"you dont know our situation then. For our two games against philly, tyler herro was HURT and was on the bus to go back to miami, which would have left us with 7 players to postpone the game. They made him get off the bus to play with his neck injury which made it worse and ultimately put him out for weeks.   Recently, yes, weve been making due giving our bench players consistent minutes but bench players obviously arent going to produce at the same level."
Personally I feel that Raptors fans tend to overrate their players a bit but the dude you are replying to literally made zero mention of Siakam or anything related to the Raptors.  Is he just not allowed to have an opinion on Tyler Herro or something?
i think you're forgetting that Tyler Herro = '91 Jordan
I’m not a Heat fan bozo plus you’ll get Tyler Herro and you’ll love it
Tyler Herro.
"I have really thought about this, and a deal with Tyler Herro, Andre Iguodala, Meyers Leonard and 3 first rounders might make the most sense. Leonard is an expiring, and Iguodala has a team option. It would be almost like a 1 for 1 with 3 first rounders. I’d probably take a swing on Herro being a great player in a few years whilst he’s on a rookie contract than taking Ben, and if I’m Miami, I do this 100%."
In Miami they call it Herro (named after Tyler Herro) Ball.
Is Tyler Herro that important?
"Nah Tyler Herro next to Westbrook = #1 Duo in the East, Personal Guarentee"
"We have most of the guys back from H&amp;S protocols except for Jimmy Butler and Avery Bradley, who are pretty important for our perimeter defense (and well, *Jimmy freaking Butler*).   Also Tyler Herro has missed the last few games with neck spasms, which has hurt as well"
But who cares? That’s like saying Tyler Herro is the best Heat player because I only watched 3 random games this year lol
"He got one point extra over Tyler Herro who was hurt for a bunch of the season but I think it’s clear that Herro is better, doesn’t take anything away from Paschall tho."
Jamal Murray and Tyler Herro I was told were better than him
"I would never say Tyler Herro is well spoken. Haliburton is. Well-spoken simply means polite, thoughtful, and engaging. Some people speak poorly, others well."
Pop quiz:  Who of these four players has the best 3-pt percentage this season?  A) Luka  B) Trey Young  C) Tyler Herro  D) Giannis
Some fans blamed Tyler Herro for underperforming in the finals.
"Tyler ""Hood Tendencies"" Herro would approve of this."
"He still went up against people like Tyler Herro, PJ Washington, Rui, Tacko, Cam Johnson, nickeil Alexander walker, etc etc. It's not like he only played against nobodies."
"Miami drafts well, the Wolves do not.  Minnesota took Jarrett Culver, the Heat took Tyler Herro, for example  That is the main difference in a nutshell"
Jack Harlow’s Tyler Herro song also lol
"Dawg. Giannis lost to a team with a best player who is worse than him and a bunch of dudes acquired via trade or developed by the Heat. What are you saying? The reason the Bucks lost to the Heat isn't because the Heat are in a desirable situation -- the Bucks are MORE TALENTED than Miami. They lost because they got outcoached severely and because Giannis woefully underperformed. This woe is me attitude has to stop from small market teams. They secure superstars and then fail to materialize competent enough teams around those stars.   Miami secured their star and he was surrounded by Bam Adebayo (developed all star), Tyler Herro (rookie), Dragic (traded for YEARS ago), Jae Crowder (traded for), and Iguodala (traded for). Jimmy Butler was signed in free agency, but he's a worse player than a lot of the stars on small market teams... Maybe teams should draft their own Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro, trade for their own Jae Crowder and Iguodala, develop their own quality coaching staff that's up to snuff and surround their home grown superstar with that instead of bullshitting around keeping coaches like Budenholzer as the head of their program.  I mean, OKC had Paul George AND Westbrook and couldn't make it out of the first round... Is that because they're a small market? Kawhi and Paul George JUST LOST TO DENVER."
IMO you guys aren’t good enough to not just take the highest talent. Not a shot at you but we have a similar situation with the last couple of drafts and I would trade PJ Washington who is a sure fire 3D wing/big for Tyler Herro who was taken right after him. Same for Bridges/SGA.  Until you’ve got the guy or until you’re a sure fire playoff squad I would keep swinging for the fences tbh
Dude do you frequent this sub? Go read a thread that involves Tyler Herro and you’ll understand what I’m saying
Straight up for Tyler Herro?
"Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro beat them 2 times. You don’t think Durant, Harden and Kyrie can do better than that?"
Tyler Herro too. The recent run on solid/great Kentucky guards has been wild
"Exactly. It's also the same mentality that leads them to overpay to keep some of those young guys and that never pan out to the unrealistic expectations they have for them at times. Guys like Tyler Johnson, Justise Winslow, Gary Harris, Otto Porter (harsh?), etc. Never really bad players, but guys that they could've moved on sooner when they had more value to get back more productive players. I think Herro especially will fall into that category at some point."
It’s definitely a big part of it but even amongst some of those teams there is overvaluing of young players. Miami reportedly having zero interest in the offer of Tyler herro Duncan Robinson picks and pick swaps(which I bet they could’ve negotiated the picks down a little if they were close on terms). Back in the day Dallas treating Roddy Beaubois like a untouchable at all costs asset during Dirks prime which would get way more flak if not for the 2011 title. There other ex also you can find   But yes making these win now moves requires spending and many aren’t interested even if they’re a potential title contender. You don’t win titles without paying the tax unless you have a Steph Curry $11 mil contract type value on your books
"Tyler Herro, Hali, Lamelo and Wiseman in the same tier as Russ, Vuc and Middleton is not right"
"lol I just bring up Kobe and Tyler Herro as a historic example and a current example of the concept I’m using. A snickers bar and a 4-course dinner at a Michelin star restaurant both belong to the category “food,” there’s a difference in the qualities of the two but they both express the concept in a way that draws out necessary qualities (both go in your mouth and are digested) and unnecessary qualities (only one has trans fats). Not saying just because Tyler Herro gets to jack up 17-footers he’s gonna win 5 rings."
"first of all, don't ever mention Kobe and fucking Tyler Herro in the same sentence ever again lol. Its like if I put Bird and Duncan Robinson in the same sentence lol. Second of all, Kobe was still good when his shots weren't going in. Look at his 15 rebounds in Game 7. You know which Game 7. Thirdly, the rest of the analysis is good."
"In the playoffs he was shooting numbers that would surprise Steph Curry, on difficult shots. Then he started this season at a lower efficiency than his last few regular seasons.  He’s a difficult-shot-maker, just like Kobe and just like Tyler Herro, when they’re going in he’s absolutely unstoppable and when they’re not going in he looks like an idiot; you just have to wait and see with a guy like that, he makes supporters and detractors both bite their tongues once a week."
"How did they pivot? They haven’t paired Trae with another superstar like the mavs did with Luka they just acquired some great role players like Gallo &amp; Rondo. You make it sound like Trae Young wanting help is a bad thing, the east is pretty much wide open &amp; even Tyler Herro looked like a star in the playoffs taking over games. Every  superstar in the east probably feels like their team could be making the finals this year &amp; while it’s extremely unlikely the Hawks make it there why wouldn’t Trae feel the same way. It would be concerning if Trae was content being in a slow rebuild even that’s still pretty much what they’re doing"
"Waiting around for the potential of Giannis reaaaally hurt us. Teams got better and we ended up paying Meyers Leonard (one of the league's best high fivers and clappers) for more per year than Houston are paying Wood.  Without Jimmy or Herro we have no offensive creation. Tyler is our best shot creator by a mile and he is being forced to learn PG on the fly.   Bam scored 20 in the first half then decided to stop shooting. If he was aggressive he could average 25. His jumper is money but he spends too much time forcing the pass instead of looking at the rim.  Pathetic effort in this game. The body language sucked and there was none of that ""heat culture"" energy that we've come to know and love.  Anyway rant over lmao"
"That’s not how any of this works my dude.  Harden is an MVP caliber player who is an offensive system on his own. Neither of the guys you mentioned are remotely close to that.  You also have to take into account the teams current situation when making a trade. Nets are in desperate win now mode and thus sold the farm to maximise their time w/ KD.   Clippers sold the farm to get both PG &amp; Kawhi.   Lakers sold the farm to maximise Lebrons time on the Lakers.  Teams like the Mavs, Celtics, Heat etc arent trading 2-3 picks for 2-3 years Lavine or Gordon because that pick in itself has more value given a fresh new young player matches the timeline of their best players (Tatum, Luka) plus the added fact that they’re on a rookie salary with more flexibility to play around with the cap.   Look at the Heat for example, 1 of those FRPs turned out to be Tyler Herro whom brings way more value than Lavine or Gordon could. I mean sure the draft is a crap shoot but GMs tend to be “glass half full” kinda guys.  That coupled with the fact that when you trade for a ready made guy, you have to tweak your entire offense to fit him as opposed to drafting someone who on fits our existing style.  A pick has more value for teams w/ a young star than it does for a team w/ a current superstar."
"More that Gordos a fairly quiet gamer nerd from Indiana and LaMelos a teen reality star, who’s very much apart of the Instagram/youtuber culture, you probably get the same level of awkwardness in convos between Tyler Herro and Kelly Olynyk or between Kuzma and Jared Dudley, LaMelos rich kid/reality star upbringing probably shaped his personality more then his race"
"As a heat fan, literally can’t believe we let Tyler Herro stop us from grabbing one of the best scorers of ALL TIME."
I’d take all the ones you said without any hesitation. Same with Tyler Herro.
"Harden really pulled up off of a plane from Houston, dropped a 30 point triple dub and then added another 4 steals for good measure. But a MIA trade was held up by Tyler Herro? Stop it lol.   Somebody's agent is probably leaking misinformation. I'm not buying that."
That’s true but there are also still people who think JJ Redick is what Tyler Herro is going to be 😂
"Around the conference finals, I saw some guy say he would rather have Tyler Herro than Steph Curry"

Tyler Herro is not the kind of player that goes top 5 in an NBA draft. Man has T-Rex arms.
"r/nba is a tale of two cities. On one hand, you get some decent basketball evaluation and threads like the Draymond Green play-breakdown. And on the other, there's this.  If this is somehow unironic, every single possible metric tells you that Trae Young is much much more valuable. Even when he's playing like an absolute bum so far in this small sample size, he STILL has a higher RAPTOR and WAR than Dort. And last year, it wasn't even close. Trae Young is a top 25-30 player with an All-NBA ceiling. Dort will be a fantastic role-player/defensive specialist/3rd-4th option on a good team. Maybe even a part-time all-star if everything plays out in his favor.  Trae Young is so much more impactful. The discussion we're having here is like comparing Tyler Herro to Giannis. I love Herro, but this is comical."
Tyler Herro because of the damn bubble.
Tyler Herro before I started liking him
Based on reports of people who went to high school in MKE Tyler Herro was a dick. So your hate may not be unwarranted.
Khris Middleton or Tyler Herro? IDC honestly I’m mostly dead inside
"In other words, Tyler Herro"
"&gt; Do you agree with Coach Calipari of UK who said if there was a tournament then Maxey would’ve been within the top 10?   I was incredibly confident that Maxey+Immanuel Quickley would have carried UK to the final four. Taking a team that lost early in the season to Evansville to a deep tournament run would have been one of the better successes of Cal's career.   So when Maxey and Quickley were lower than I thought in the draft, I felt confident they would still have a Tyler Herro-esque ride into the NBA. I thought Quickley would be really good because he's hard working and smart and has a great FT%, which usually means a guy can shoot and is a shooter. I thought Maxey would be fine because he is sort of like a slower DeAaron Fox with a shot that doesn't look great but is surprisingly clutch. Both players developed floaters and can seemingly get you 2pts when you need it."
Tyler Herro gets lightly tapped on the elbow: Four point play.  Shake Milton gets an entire mans draped all over him: I think his foot was on the line
"Nesmith I can understand but he's on a super-tight leash right now; ideally he's a sharpshooter with the physical size to be a great wing.  Romeo's a shooting guard that can't shoot. Apparently Ainge was in love with Tyler Herro but couldn't trade up (in hindsight, that Memphis pick was a lot lower than originally valued and I think they should've made more of an effort to flip it while it had higher speculative value)."

“Wicki wicki wah in da wild wild west” - Tyler Herro
Led by a role player in Tyler Herro. This win means nothing.
Shake Milton is Tyler Herro if he could defend and didn’t have T-Rex arms.
Fuckin love tyler herro
"Nah Joe Harris is Duncan Robinson. Kyrie gets the lofty ""Tyler Herro"" role."
"I said that back then, i wanted booker, now there is no chance that happens. At this rate its gonna be hard to get tyler herro"
I don't blame them...  Tyler herro is too fun to watch... Nunn is a stud.
"Who cares what the fit is with Wall? He's irrelevant. Your future right now regardless is a lotto team without any of your own picks lol.   So you passed up on tangible talent you hope turns into quality players like Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons or Tyler Herro? Particularly with the Sixers, but also those other teams, your asking prices were way too high. So now you get to either wait for middle schoolers to turn into elite college players when you can draft them...and get to be what exactly in the meantime?"
"1. Bradley Beal FOR Pascal Siakam  2. Bradley Beal FOR Jrue Holiday  3. Bradley Beal FOR Tyler Herro, Andre Iguodala, Kelly Olynk  4. Bradley Beal FOR Ben Simmons  5. Bradley Beal FOR Al Horford, 4 1st Round picks  6. Bradley Beal FOR Jamal Murray  7. Bradley Beal FOR Eric Bledsoe, JJ Redick, 2 1st Round picks  8. Bradley Beal FOR Kemba Walker, Payton Pritchard  Which of these trades is the best?"
"It’s 4 players, one of which is HORRIBLE right now in Herro.  Tyler Herro has the worst on/off on any starter in the NBA, and is close to last in RAPTOR."
"I would think he is valued, and that's why he's a must have for the Rockets here. They want a good young player, and he fits the bill. If you're the one getting the incoming superstar you're definitely losing something valuable like a Tyler Herro + more."
"Blake is at .026 WS/48 this season, just behind Tyler Herro at 169th in the NBA.  Would anyone be talking about a ""super team"" if a contender signed Tyler Herro?"
"This is a gross oversimplification of Bam's defense lol. Dude guards all 5 positions every night, switching every pick and roll, covering for defensive mistakes made by putrid defenders like Olynyk, Duncan, Herro, Dragic, etc. He regularly bottles up perimeter stars into passing away from that matchup. Numbers don't equate for this shit lol.   Bam is a top 5 defender in the NBA. Miami has a top 5-6 defense with 3 positive defenders on it and 10 horrendous ones on it. Like, worst in the league bad. Orlando has a below average defense. 18th in drtg and 22nd in field goal % against. There is a grand canyon gap between Bam's defense and Vucevic's. The gap between them defensively is probably 5x the difference between them offensively.   Bam is close to Gobert defensively, if not certainly more useful come playoff time. Utah somehow has a worse defensive field goal % against than we do despite the fact that Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Goran Dragic, Kelly Olynyk, Gabe Vincent, Max Strus are arguably bottom 20 defensive players of anyone getting minutes in the NBA."
Wilt for the ladies x 10  Harden for the ladies x club  Luka for the video games + ladies  Klay for the weed + ladies  Booker for the games + weed + gangbang  Tyler Herro for the leash + collar he says I need because I'm a bad boy
"Did you say what they were asking for harden though? Apparently they wanted:  Tyler Herro Duncan Robinson Precious Achiuwa Kendrick Nunn Salary Filler Two 1st-Round Picks 4 Pick Swaps  Bam-harden-butler would be awesome, but there’s no way they win a chip with just that and then literally scraps. so if we don’t win a chip, what’s the point of going all in?"
Trumpet version of Tyler Herro is fire as hell
YOOO THEY'RE PLAYING TYLER HERRO LMFAO
"Closest comparison I can think of is prime Wayne Gretzky getting traded to LA for 4 first round picks (one already drafted), a mid tier player and cash (equivalent to 1/2 the team salary). But that's not much more than the PG to the Clippers trade.  So I guess something like 1993 Jordan for Tyler Herro, four 1st round picks, and $55 Millon. Assuming Pat Riley is as stupid as the Oilers GM in 1988."
Tyler Herro - Milwaukee Suburbs
That kid’s name? Tyler Herro.
Tyler Herro and Jaylen brown are just too good to be traded for one of the greatest scorers in the history of basketball. Duh
Don’t know why you’re being downvoted. When Traes not feeling it he relies on his foul drawing ability. It got the game tied against the Heat a couple nights ago until Tyler Herro caught fire
Maybe you could clarify a bit but Tyler Herro was also an elite college FT shooter and had a great rookie season.
"Heat fans: ""Where's Tyler Herro?"""
This isn't even our final form  Still missing Tyler Herro and Avery Bradley
"""healthy""  Tyler Herro, Avery Bradley, and Myers Leonard would like to object."
Imagine getting locked up by Tyler Herro smh
"Kentucky  PG: Jamal Murray, De’Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: SGA, Tyler Herro, Malik Monk  SF: Devin Booker and Keldon Johnson  PF: Anthony Davis and Julius Randle  C: Towns, Bam Adebayo, Enes Kanter  There’s also Eric Bledsoe, Nerlens Noel and DeMarcus Cousins if he can get back to at least a portion of what he was."
NoT WorTH TYler HerrO
They had like 1 pick and Tyler Herro
No you didn’t you have like 1 pick and Tyler Herro
"Tyler ""Not Just A Sandwich"" Herro."
Unless of course it involves Heat legend Tyler Herro
"Bruh are you forgetting they wanted TYLER HERRO  **THE** TYLER HERO  THE MAN THAT ONCE DROPPED **37** POINTS IN THE ECF!?!?!  THE MAN WHO JACK HARLOW NAMED A SONG AFTER?!?!  WHO WOULD WANT JAMES HARDBUM OVER TYLER ""LIMITLESS POTENTIAL"" HERRO!!!?!    (This is mostly jokes but I've seen some Heat fans wilding on Twitter)"
Tyler herro
"C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid  PF: LeBron James / Giannis   SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kevin Durant  SG: Luka Dončić  / Bradley Beal  PG: Steph Curry / Trae Young  6: Damian Lillard / Nikola Vucevic  7: DeMar DeRozan / Jaylen Brown  8: Christian Wood / Kyle Lowry  9: SGA / Zach LaVine  10: Chris Paul / Sexton  11: Donovan Mitchell / Jerami Grant   12: De'Aaron Fox / Sabonis  13: Zion Williamson / Randle  14: Ja Morant / Jimmy Butler  15: KAT / Hayward  &amp;#x200B;  All things considered it's not a horrible idea, each team has an All Star caliber player on it's roster, but the problem is injuries and all star players underperforming . Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
Tyler Herro when in the beginning of the season for sure
Here are some of OP's great threads:  -Would a Tyler Herro for Ben Simmons deal be good?  -The Jokic vs Embiid debate solely exists due to the referees having terrible calls  -Should the Sixers trade for Kemba Walker?  -Is Embiid dodging good competition by blaming his back injury?  -Will people start seeing that Ben Simmons really isn't good enough to lead a team or help a team win a chip?
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9. Keldon Johnson (#29)   Other players that outperformed their picks include Brandon Clarke (#21), Grant Williams (#22) and Kendrick Nunn (undrafted).  Players that dropped out of my top 10: Darius Garland, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, but all of them would probably be in the 11-20 range"
People forget he was still all rookie 1st team and the everyday starter all of last season before the bubble. Dude was solid and then at the start of the season had extremely limited minutes to make room for the Tyler Herro experiment while Jimmy was hurt.
"Bam's prolly gonna get in that lower 10 range by season's end, unless the HEAT get a another big by the deadline or Tyler ""Guard-Center"" Herro goes nuclear on his rebounding ventures."
"The rumors have stopped? Damn, I was excited for getting Tyler Herro and 2 picks from Miami for him. Pretty disappointed ngl"
"Shabazz Napier isn’t an nba starter and is riding Portland’s bench, Okogie has the worst catch and shoot 3pt% in the league 2 years in a row and is benched, Wiggins is Wiggins, culver isn’t an nba starter and had the worst shooting season for a rookie, roco is an nba starter. Compare that to Bam, without butler this year the heat have sucked and are the 11th seed. Last year Bam had: Butler, Jae Crowder who is a starter on the suns, Dragic who’s a quality starter, Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro. Bam was also healthy and has lead the heat to an 11th seed in the east without butler. Your opinion is formed purely on narratives and not acknowledging roster talent.  Shut the fuck up😂"
"Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Deandre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson, Tyler Herro, Gordon Hayward... ALL on my fantasy team."
Is this the same Tyler “off the table for Harden” Herro?
"A lot of guys who are forced to shoot under pressure. here's a few  * [Tyler Herro](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629639/shots-dash/) * [Evan Fournier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203095/shots-dash/) * [Brandon Ingram (tho he's more than stationary from 3)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627742/shots-dash/) * [Terry Rozier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1626179/shots-dash/) * [Gary Trent](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629018/shots-dash/) * [Jordan Clarkson](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203903/shots-dash/) * [Tim Hardaway Jr.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203501/shots-dash/)  Each of those guys shows a significantly higher aptitude for shooting with defenders in their vicinity, which I think gives a better idea of their ability as spot up threats. Part of spot up shooting, imo, is actually being a threat that other teams respect. Yeah sure Myles Turner can make like 35% of his open 3s. Who cares? No defense does. (This is the trap of the stretch 5 that a lot of teams fall into. Unless you're KAT, it doesn't affect the defense).   Lonzo's shot profile is much more in line with someone like Jae Crowder, both of whom get ignored by every defense in the league. My big point is that we put way too much stock into one number - overall 3pt % - to tell us who's a good shooter and who isn't, and then are surprised when guys fall off in the playoffs or the bubble. Dig a little deeper and you can really start understanding different levels of shooting ability."
"The biggest issue with Boston right now is that there are two horrible defenders starting for this team. Kemba has his size issues and Jaylen has been among the worst off-ball defenders in the NBA. If Boston really wants to shore up its defense, one of Kemba and Jaylen must head to the bench because it is impossible to field an elite perimeter defense with both in the starting lineup.  I would bench Jaylen, personally. Kemba is terrible on-ball, but he doesn't get lost nearly as much as Jaylen does. People don't remember, but Jaylen gave up the OG game-winner last year versus the Raptors, and he's also the biggest reason why we lost to Miami because Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro ran circles around Jaylen. It's honestly impressive and depressing just how terrible Jaylen is at off-ball defense. Sure, he's elite defending one-on-one, but what good is elite on-ball defense when teams switch everything these days?"
KCP protected LePussy James from the scary man Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro &gt; Hero Sandwich..... @ me
Tyler herro is a role player
Tyler herro easily. He goes top 3 in a redraft
"Eh the Heat were missing Avery Bradley, goran dragic and Tyler herro (injured after 13 minutes)"
He is being advertised as the next tyler herro of miami.
"Don't let the Lakers fans hear you say that, he's their Tyler Herro"
"""Tyler Herro will be Kobe in his prime guys trust me we don't need Harden"""
"That was a great stand but we got incredibly lucky in that OT, because Tyler Herro got two WIDE OPEN uncontested threes off our defensive switching miscues, and he bricked both. And I mean wide open. Like, he took them in stride, got to set his feet. Weird game all around, with Curry missing three wide open uncontested threes as well."
Heat didn't think Harden was as good as Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson haha.
LeMickey is shook rn. No more playing Tyler Herro and Friends in a Disney Clubhouse practice gym
"""is Tyler herro white"" - the greatest thread in the history of forums, locked by a moderator after 12,239 pages of heated debate,"
"I mean dont even think its a white thing, its literally *just* the hair. He's an athletic freak and he damn near has like top 3 jacked/veiny arms in nba history for a white guy lol. Dude is 6'5 and fucking BUILT and I really dont get it when people say he looks like a random office worker or whatever, he could almost pass for an NFL defensive back or some shit if you threw some shoulder pads on him.   I dont see anyone saying Tyler Herro or Gordon Hayward look like UPS drivers.. shit, I would go as far as to say if caruso traded hair with gordon hayward, on this current Lakers team he would be like one of the top 25 most sought after players in the league in terms of marketing and advertising and would literally be looked at by casual fans as like the 3rd wheel of the Lakers big 3 behind Lebron and AD. Attractiveness bias is a hell of a drug lol"
These guys thought Tyler Herro was not worth giving up for Harden but now he's not an NBA level player.
"They need another star with Jimmy. The team has good bones right now, but is not title ready. Was kind of a fluke that they made the finals. They’re a good team, but it was more so a case of the teams they beat (especially Milwaukee) underestimating them.   No one will underestimate Miami now and their roster has not improved at all since the finals. They saved cap for Giannis or Harden and can’t get either now. Beal has his head in the sand about the Wizards, so I don’t really know what they could do. Tyler Herro is like a Nickelodeon version of Disney’s Steph Curry, not sure why Miami is so damned to keep him."
" Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Precious Achiuwa, Kendrick Nunn, Salary Filler, Two 1st-Round Picks, 4 Pick Swaps For Harden for two years."
" Sadly this thread and trying to speak reasonably or sensibly within it is a lost cause, but you're right. This thread is full of dumb people. For some reason there's a ton of people on /r/nba who are envious of Tyler Herro and just want to see him fail or be traded; now because the Heat have had a bad season due to injuries/covid they get to squawk to anyone who will listen like they aren't bitter individuals."
"Tyler ""Westbrook"" Herro"
&gt;Yeah ALL the various reports by shams and woj that miami didnt want to include herro were totally wrong  What reports?  Wasn't Shams also reporting that Houston wouldn't trade with Brooklyn unless Kyrie was involved?  &gt;it was houston who didnt want tyler herro included in the deal NOT miami  Who said this? My point was Herro had nothing to do with any potential trade not being worked out
So you're saying Herro is Russell Westbrook.   Anyone got odds on a Tyler Herro MVP season sometime in his career?
Yeah ALL the various reports by shams and woj that miami didnt want to include herro were totally wrong  it was houston who didnt want tyler herro included in the deal NOT miami
"Yeah, but Harden and Curry are no Tyler Herro /s"
"Tyler Herro had the opportunity to do just that this season when Jimmy was out, he failed and got benched for Dragic.  &gt;OG  Seriously? Honestly your knowledge on this subject seems extremely limited. This is worse then when you listed all-stars and one of the least efficient players in NBA history."
"I believe if Andrew Wiggins, Tyler Herro, OG Anunoby, Terry Rozier were given the same situation that Grant has been given in Detroit, they would do similar. Those 4 are not even sniffing all-nba talent. Jerami Grant is not that fucking efficient lmao he shoots 44% from the field and 39% from 3. It’s ok."
Last season nobody new what the hell to expect from Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson and bam s growth now that they have seen it in the biggest stage they have been pretty much figured out think about it as the sophomore slump most players suffered but as a whole team. Their defense that was what took them to the playoffs has just been outright awful too
"Tyler Herro with one of the weirdest statlines of the season, goes 3/15 but grabs 15 rebounds and blocks 3 shots wtf. Tyler Herro"
Tyler Herro decided he wanted to play like a center today minus the FG% and he did.
Tyler Herro is not and will never be James Harden lmao.
No there was a report of Houstons asking price from the Heat  - Tyler Herro - Duncan Robinson - Precious Achiuwa - Kendrick Nunn - Salary Filler - Two 1st-Round Picks - 4 Pick Swaps
idk how heat fans were saying you cant do tyler herro for Harden man
"Who knows. Goran Dragic has been hurt recently and Jimmy's coming off COVID but doesn't look that bad. I think the bigger issue is they're putting a ton of pressure on Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro to produce on both ends and maybe they're just not ready to be so important to a competitive team's starting 5?  When you're depending on Kendrick Nunn, Precious Achiuwa, Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro to perform well, you gotta kinda accept the inconsistently that comes with it."
I’ve lost track of how many games Tyler Herro has shot Miami out of this year.
"Tyler has a much more intelligent and calm game. He doesn't stat chase or try to make flashy low efficiency plays like Steph. It might not show up on the box score but the heat are going to win and Herro is going to be a big part of that, as will Steph."
"Where did you get it from that Pat Riley wouldn't trade Tyler Herro for James Harden? He'd do it in a heartbeat if he could. Ultimately, I don't think we had the necessary assets for the trade because we don't have picks. But if we could match what the Rockets asked for, Pat would do it 100/100 times."
Remember when Heat didn’t wanna give up Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson for Harden lmfao
Tyler Herro doesn’t strike me as someone with Jarret Allen level maturity
Wait there's a Tyler Herro song?
Just say Tyler herro is overrated and when they give you a hard time be like I meant the song. Badabing
Help: how can I call Herro overrated without getting beheaded by Heat fans?  Woah I meant to say that Tyler Herro has GOAT potential. Funny how autocorrect works
Tyler herro has crazy per 90 min stats tho buh
Nah man you just don't understand how good Tyler Herro is /s  (I like Tyler Herro- he's a damn good player- but you gotta trade him for James Harden lmao)
"Honestly, I’d say mostly the heat.  Nuggets, Murray and Jokic have chemistry and yeah theyd be 10x better with harden but I can understand why they didn’t want to give up much for him  Philly basically pulled the trigger but I don’t think Houston wanted to give harden back to morey  But the Heat; the Heat have a veteran star and an all star center in win now mode. They came out the finals and could have added harden but they decided to keep Tyler Herro for “culture”. They should have put him on the private jet to Houston"
What's wrong with Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson?
"Jimmy Butler, Bam, and Harden would be a HELL of a fucking team and they didn’t wanna give up Tyler Herro dawg I really hope that rumor wasn’t 100% true"
“Heat didn’t want to include Tyler Herro”  Fml ...
"No Tyler Herro is untouchable, he could one day be a great role player"
Why would anyone want to trade Tyler Herro or Maxley for Harden? Those dudes clearly have brighter futures.
"James Harden is James Harden, but Tyler Herro could be anything! He could even be James Harden!"
"This is what I've been saying since Day 1 but got downvoted by the nephew circlejerk.   How the fuck do you not give up Thybulle or Maxey to get a guy like James fucking Harden.  Same goes for Heat, Tyler Herro? WTF?! You are going to keep Tyler Herro over James Harden?!"
I just couldn’t get over how TYLER HERRO was a dealbreaker. Lmfaooo
Tyler herro who?
"There were fans who didn't want to trade the likes of Tyler Herro, Jamal Murray or Pascal Siakam for James Harden. It's almost like people forgot the man is literally a one man offensive system as we saw for years in Houston."
Imaging not wanting to trade Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro for this guy
He could be 18 and you still trade him for Harden 10/10 times. I dont know how this is even a conversation.  Tyler Herro is a good player. James Harden is an all-time player.
He's not worth tyler herro
Can any heat fans justify genuinely thinking Tyler Herro is a good player?
Terrance Mann &gt; Tyler herro
Tyler “Bucket” Herro
"I still can't get over how indignant Celts fans were over passing up on a S&amp;T for Myles Turner because.... reasons  That extra draft pick you traded wasn't gonna be worth missing out on a player who perfectly fits your team, the $18 mil Turner cost wasn't much to give up and all these excuses that your young 2nd rookie will eventually turn into a superstar given time and isn't worth trading for Turner is BS  The mental gymnastics some people engaged in to not trade for Harden when he was at his cheapest value was absolutely ridiculous. 'Hurts team chemistry' or 'this 2nd year player who had a nice couple playoff games is too valuable to trade' are absolute BS.   **Harden is a superstar worth more than Tyler Herro and some filler, worth more than Simmons, Thybulle, Maxey and picks and is worth more than Jaylen Brown and filler**"
"My head says Sexton. He's not *that* terrible on defense, and he's two years younger than DJ. He's clearly superior offensively.  I have never been a Tyler Herro guy, and I just don't think he's on the same level."
Not Tyler Herro is the real answer. Sexton vs Murray is more a question of fit.
"How is it any more special than last years’s draft or the year before’s?  Last year’s draft had Zion, Ja, RJ, Hunter, Garland, Coby White, Cam Reddish, Cam Johnson, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro  And that’s all just the lottery guys. Lot of other gems outside of it too"
Tyler Herro
"He had it last year  [“I was sick for a week or two,” Herro said. “My chest was hurting really bad. I had it right when the season shut down.”](https://apnews.com/article/miami-boston-celtics-tyler-herro-miami-heat-nba-d590f48be2c843a2bb5962b9649c50b8)  So far as we know...it's Herro, Bam, Nunn, Butler, Bradley who had it"
Maybe 6 months ago but I don't think anyone rates Tyler Herro anymore lmao
Tyler Herro.
Oh look its this stupid saying again that makes no sense. Tyler Herro being possibly inefficient doesn't mean I can't discuss inefficient players on other teams.   By the way since the trade deadline he's only getting better and he's a 2nd year player. But keep deflecting away from the topic of this thread if that makes you feel any better about Westbrook being the most inefficient high volume scorer in the history of the NBA.
"Tyler Herro. Demar Derozan.   If the 76ers had a quicker player who can get his own shot at any time i think that would put em above the lakers, Easily."
Tyler Herro by Jack Harlow
Your favourite team wouldn’t trade Tyler Herro for James Harden
"If a buff 6'6 guy did the Tyler Herro sneer to me in the streets, unprovoked, I'd assume his muscle powder protein shake was giving him some nasty diarrhea."
"I’m not gonna lie, I know Tyler Herro is 6’5 and a professional athlete but I have no reason to say a 20 yr old kid scrawny can beat my ass, especially if I have no clue if He trained in fighting or not."
"The only people calling Tyler Herro “fake tough” if you’ve noticed are redditors who’ve probably never played organized basketball like you. Notice you don’t see anyone else calling him fake tough for... snarling?   The gap of toughness between you and any athlete is far wider than the gap between Herro and LeBron. A 19 year old rookie made some important plays in a Finals game, makes a face, and Redditors get on their Cheeto-encrusted keyboards to scream about how fake tough he is.   If you don’t see the irony in this and how laughable it is you’re a lost cause bud. You’re not in any position to call any professional fake tough or not in any situation. It’s that simple, not sure why you can’t comprehend that. You just look like an idiot."
"Does your brain work or no?   For example, Tyler Herro in comparison to Lebron is not tough. If Tyler Herro squares up to Lebron, people will say it's fake tough.   You get that or you too slow? Go back to watching Tennis."
I mean you expect Laker fans to cheer on a dude tryna flex on their team? Lol of course they gonna shit talk back. Especially when said dude is Tyler Herro.
Morally I have to say Malik Beasley.  However taking away off the court issues it's Jarrett Culver. The guy fucking sucks and seeing him on the court just reminds me we traded away a potential Tyler Herro or PJ Washington + Dario Saric for him
"Fans were going after Tyler Herro for a smirk, they don’t have the energy for all that"
"The Heat had to trade half of their roster and several picks for Harden, including Nunn that you mention would be in the rotation.  We would not have that depth to trade for Oladipo.  Iggy would have been traded too to make the salaries work.  Were you thinking all the Heat had to trade was Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro and picks?  If yes, you should stop scrolling NBA Twitter.  The reality of why the Nets superteam came to be is that the Rockets owner didn't want to trade with the 76ers who had the best package, out of pettiness."
Why would the heat do that? It would ruin the culture and they would probably have to lose generational talent Tyler Herro
"38% from three and 45% from the field for a 20 year old 2nd option on a playoff team that doesn’t have much spacing with Elfrid Payton and Mitchell Robinson being 40% of the starting lineup is actually rather efficient and in fact, he has a higher FG% and 3pt% than Ja Morant, Coby White, and Tyler Herro while playing much better defense than they are as well. Given his situation offensively being lesser than stellar I would actually say he’s been pretty efficient."
"Kevin Huerter, Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, TJ McConnell, Joe Harris &amp; Grayson Allen would all like a word with you."
Shoutout to Jalen Rose picking them as favourite in the East after they got Dipo LMAO  &gt;Near the trade deadline it seems nerves got to both Tyler and Duncan since they were in the conversation a lot.  I think one of them should def be traded. I'd try to trade Herro because he's nice but people seem to be a little too in love with him for whatever reason
"Larry Bird, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, John Stockton, John Havlicek, Goran Dragic, Tyler Herro, Steve Kerr, Bill Laimbeer, Payton Prichard,"
"I agree with you to an extent but I also think it depends. Like Point guards have the steepest learning curve but Center's still have to call out coverages and learn defense and stuff. I think the rankings of positional NBA transition difficulty go    1. Point guards and Primary creators (Killian Hayes, Leandro Bolmaro)   2. Centers and defensive bigs (Wiseman, Mobley, Isaiah Jackson)   3. Off the bounce scorers (Cam Thomas, Tyler Herro)   4. Plug n' play wings ( Devin Vassell, Moses Moody)"
"For me, it’s hard to balance what is good coaching/system and what is good development. It seems pretty safe to say that the continued development of guys like Bam, DRob, Herro has to be partially credited to the organization. But, the Heat have also had quite a few players that seemed developed here and perform worse on other teams (JRich, James Johnson, Tyler Johnson, Norris Cole, Chalmers). So, I do think that the Heat are one of the better developmental teams, but I also think they develop players to specifically fit their system and they may not seem as developed elsewhere. Also shout out to the Nuggets, Grizz, Spurs and Raptors, they know how to max out the potential of their players"
mods removed this but will let someone ask if you’d rather have jordan clarkson or tyler herro on your team
"Bjelica was the primary playmaker when he won the MVP in Euroleague. He has much more to offer than the shooting. I don't think hesitation is an issue with him. He's known for his good decision making, passing-making plays.  I don't think this is a necessarily good thing but I am sure Heat is in a better situation. There are many veteran players so he'll be able to play his strengths after all.  Dont expect him to be Tyler Herro/Duncan Robinson quick trigger shooter. He has more skillset than just playing a Ryan Anderson role."
I remember when Tyler Herro was better then Jaylen Brown
Didn’t y’all do the same thing with Tyler Herro since he scored 37 that one time?
Instant impact - Jordan Clarkson  For the Future- Tyler Herro
"But who's winning? MJ, Kareem, Bird, Magic and Tim vs Bron, Jimmy Butler, Vucevic, Tyler Herro and THT?"
"That's a hard question honestly, Herro has been shooting rather poorly this year so he'd not be the best fit for the 6ers. Clarkson's role could overlap with Shake Milton, but they could be fine running the second unit together, he's a tunnel vision kind of player tho. Considering we have a bench PG now in Hill and that Herro is bigger with better playmaking anyways, I'm going for Tyler."
"Jimmy Butler Bam and....Tyler Herro (?) were better than Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, and Detlef Schrempf? You have to be shitting me.   Let’s pretend you’re not and ignore the fact that the heat team was injured.   Regular season:  Heat: 44–29 (.603) SuperSonics: 64–18 (.780)  Accolades:  SuperSonics: Payton won DPOTY, was an All Star, All NBA 2nd team, All Defense 1st team, was the steals leader. Detlef was All NBA 3rd team. Shawn Kemp was an All Star and NBA 2nd team.  Heat: Jimmy Butler was All Star and NBA 3rd team. Bam was an All Star and Defense 2nd team.   Competition:  SuperSonics: Swept the reigning champs Houston Rockets, then faced against Utah Jazz with Stockton and Malone in their prime (Who would go onto to the next 2 NBA finals).   Heat: the Milwaukee bucks with reigning MVP Giannis and friends, and then mighty Boston Celtics."

Guys like Tyler Herro could very likely have more NBA career earnings than LeBron James.  We'll have Chandler Parson's type players finessing the league and making more than Jordan+LeBron ever made in their NBA careers (NBA contracts only).

"Stop w this shit. We don’t say that about Caruso or Duncan Robinson or Tyler Herro and they all white.  It’s bc of his playstyle, Big Jok looks like an old drunk man on the court while doing all the insane stuff he doing, its amazing to watch. Nothing to do with the fact he’s white, if a black player was moving the same way he moves we’d be saying the same thing."

Well give you one gently used Tyler herro.
Tyler Herro is off the table! Jamal Murray is a non starter!  Even if those reports are bullshit all the fanbases who made arguments agreeing are morons.
My girlfriend likes them.  Or at least she likes looking at Tyler Herro in them.
a much needed tyler herro upgrade
Imagine if there is a race to the courts between Lebron getting a trademark and Tyler Herro getting a name change.
tyler herro.
"I honestly wasn't sure how to take your comment until I got to the end, since I legitimately had people on here arguing the they preferred keeping Tyler Herro over acquiring James Harden."
"That's because Harden didn't fit team culture or just wasn't a good player, not as good as Tyler Herro or Tyrese Maxey that's for sure. And there's only one ball so clearly Harden would wreck their team's chemistry. He might even trick the clean young naive rookies into becoming regular strip club patrons, and who knows the catastrophe that would bring.   But Aldridge, he's clean and wholesome. He's an upstanding, morally upright Christian man. I guess idk. Just trying to give you some ideas why."
Tyler Herro
Well Tyler Herro went from 40% last season to 32% this season so more than 1 season sample size is needed. Luka’s career &amp; FT% suggests he’s closer to a 34-35% shooter. If he continues this next season then yes he’s made a jump
Im sorry but I only have enough hate in my heart for 1 person and that's Tyler herro /s
The Miami heat offense is basically Someone sets a screen handoff to duncan robinson at the 3 OR jimmy butler (when he feels like it ) drives the ball and gets the foul call OR bam score a little jump shot from the paint .. there that’s the offense . occasionally you get tyler herro to shoot some pull ups but dude has been getting too much head this season and his legs seem drained.  Dragic occasionally will hit a 3 pointer and then hit the bench. Nunn well he could hit the little pull up but he needs to play more minutes to get into his groove .. that’s the offense guys
"Tyler Herro is black and Zach Collins is white, how could you confuse them for each other????"
A rookie would NEVER talk about Tyler Herro like this
WISCONSIN BOYS BABY.  FUCK YEAH.  Tyler Herro last year and now Haliburton.  Too bad this guy isn't gonna have a playoff run
I think Tyler Herro can rival him for coolest name tbh
"""Not too many people make it from where i'm from"" -Tyler Herro"
Tyler Herro lol
"Derrick Williams at 2 in 2011. Hindsight is a wondeeful thing but we could have traded down for Kemba, Klay or Kawhi  Dunn over Murray in 2016  Our owner forcing us to trade Lavine instead of Wiggins  Trading up for Culver where we could have had PJ Washington or Tyler Herro if we stood still - both of whom fit our style of play"
The worst part of his content is he has no takes and then pats himself on the back for fake takes he had that he didn’t speak about.   During the playoffs he said he was very high on Tyler herro at the draft and was happy to see he was right about him. Which is just a complete lie.
Meyers Leonard   Luka Doncic   JJ Reddick  Kyle Korver   Tyler Herro
Said this in the GT but Like Kennard is who people thought Tyler Herro would be.
Kennard is who people thought Tyler Herro would be
Tyler Herro will tho
"&gt;I don't think any Knicks fan gives a shit about Tyler Herro  [Exhibit A](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mbw2mq/tyler_herros_last_5_games/gs2gqd3/?context=3), [Exhibit B](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mbw2mq/tyler_herros_last_5_games/gs0bxsn/?context=3), [Exhibit C](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mbw2mq/tyler_herros_last_5_games/gs16htq/?context=3), [Exhibit D](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mbw2mq/tyler_herros_last_5_games/gs11rui/?context=3), [Exhibit E](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mbw2mq/tyler_herros_last_5_games/gs0iqow/?context=3). All from 30 seconds of sorting by controversial in the latest signature r/nba Herro hate thread.  Like I said  &gt;Since Knick fans are so obsessed with comparing them all the time"
"I don't think any Knicks fan gives a shit about Tyler Herro. We were always going to pick RJ with the 3rd pick, why would we care at all about Herro. Good for him he's playing above expectation of where he's picked. We all love RJ, he's playing great for us. RJ still has never had a team built to suit his strengths and has greatly improved over this past offseason."
"Guys, don't worry, Tyler ""Better than Harden"" Herro and Duncan ""Better than Lowry"" Robinson will eventually start putting up 50 a game"
"Well multiple players could be good, like Tyler Herro and Precious or something like that, for example. Now it probably wouldn't be a fit cause Jimmy plays the same but again, it's an example"
Idk ask Tyler Herro I guess
Yeah because teams rest star players during the playoffs. Listen to yourself man. Any player has the capability to make a difference in a playoff game. Didn’t Tyler Herro drop 37 off the bench last year in the Finals? Didn’t Ron Artest drop 20 in Game 7 and hit the clutch go ahead bucket? Did you watch the 2013 NBA finals? Danny Green might’ve won Finals MVP if the Spurs won. Idk how your argument is ‘a player can make a difference if they play’ like that’s not the aim of any signing made in the NBA.
Guess that's what you get for turning your back on your teammate. Didn't Tyler Herro assault a woman? Far worse than anything Leonard did...
What do you mean? Tyler Herro gonna drop 37 on the Nets
Yes! He is a fraud and nothing more than a high-usage Tyler Herro!
Tyler “ future mvp” Herro
"Tyler ""Michael Jordan"" Herro isn't carrying the team?"
It was baby Tyler Herro all along.
Can you imagine Miami's true son Tyler Herro shooting a clutch buzzer beater over Harden?
"Jimmy Butler took them to 6 with Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro as his running mates last year. They’re not this KD Warriors level of juggernaut.  They very may well lose, but they’d have a good shot at winning a series against the Lakers."
This is the package yeah?  * Tyler Herro * Duncan Robinson * Precious Achiuwa * Kendrick Nunn * Salary Filler * Two 1st-Round Picks * 4 Pick Swaps  That's a huuuuge price to pay but it would have been workable.  Dragic Harden Butler Bam Olynyk.  Maybe you could have kept someone like Nunn out of the conversation too.
Fertita didn't make Pat Riley withhold Tyler Herro in a harden trade.
Tyler Herro and draft capital
But Tyler herro tho
Tyler Herro scored 37 points!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They got Tyler Herro man. They gonna be ok.
"Well they traded all those assets to give themselves a good chance to win a title in the present. Harden was available to other teams too, it’s not the Nets fault that teams valued Tyler Herro and Jamal Murray more than James harden"
"Rent free in the way the first person you get mad at is KD LOL stay mad bum and enjoy keeping Tyler ""the next Harden"" Herro"
Tyler Herro has entered the chat.
"Hm. I think Gordon Hayward, Goran Dragic, Payton Pritchard, ~~Tyler Herro~~, Duncan Robinson, Cody Zeller, and Doug McDermott are more similar to Larry Bird than Kevin Durant is."
"Hypothetically, What do they have to give up to get him though? Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson aren’t getting you KAT"
"I think for tatum, being the top/or one of the top players on a team that went to the ECF 2 out of the 3 or so years he’s been in the league places much more expectations on him. Tyler herro is sort of going through something similar right now. When players have successful campaigns so early, the ante is upped."
"tyler herro, superhero, guitar hero... Lakers in 6"
"That pick was actually a coin flip away Tyler Herro. So just pure luck it turned into Langford instead. And Romeo is still very young, there is a good chance he can bounce back from his injuries and turn into a real asset"
"I mean I'm sure in one of the multiverses Tyler Herro could develop to be better than him, why would they trade him?"
If that’s the trade I agree that they passed on James. No way i’m giving Herro and Bam for Harden. Always thought it was just for tyler and pieces.
Tyler Herro

"Yeah I feel like they should trade him too. They're ass, and they could get a good package of, say, a good young player and some high draft picks. Say, a Tyler Herro kinda guy and a slew of first rounders. I feel like Miami could really use him tbh"
Fast PP&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tyler Herro.
"Don't get me wrong, Luka is a good player. But I don't think he's quite at Tyler Herro level just yet. Honestly it's a pretty good deal for you guys. /s"
I don’t think that’s true lol. I mean I know my perspective is altered but you wouldn’t recognize any 6’6 players in public. You would as they get closer to 7 feet. Duncan Robinson just looks like a regular tall white guy. Same with like Tyler herro.
That kid?  Tyler Herro
Where is Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro this year?
"At least that makes more sense than Tyrese Maxey or Tyler Herro being ""too much""."
How about we just let Tyler Herro and Kevin Huerter go at it 1 vs. 1.
Luckily I think the leagues are a bit smarter than they were in the past. They used to just give poor 19 year olds millions of dollars and say good luck. Now they have guys come in and give them actual financial advice. Although from what I’ve heard about Tyler Herro not everyone listens lol.
"Unless your name is Lonzo Ball, Tyler Herro, Westbrook KP, or Begley, a bad game or stretch of bad games does not get posted here to push a narrative."
"Tyler Herro could be anything, even a Harden"
"You’re overrating some aspects. DLO is not a top 10 pg. 10 point guards that are better than him are Curry, harden, dame, luka, Westbrook, CP3, Ben Simmons, Fox, Trae, and Jamal Murray.   Also, I very much doubt they’re going to be a top 6 team next year. That means they’ll have to be better than teams like jazz, suns, clippers, nuggets, lakers, 76ers, nets, and bucks. That just won’t happen. Timberwolves sound good on paper with KAT, DLO, and Edwards but other teams sound good on paper too. Heat for example check off basically every point that you stated. Bam is one of the best centers in the league. Butler is one of the best forwards in the league. Tyler herro was one of the best rookies as well. They have solid role players with nunn, dragic, robinson, igoudala, etc. were they a top 6 team this year? Nope. Granted they were riddled with injuries in the beginning of the year but still even when healthy I don’t think they were a top 6 team. T-Wolves have a nice big 3 but I don’t even think their big 3 is a top 10 big 3 in league for next year either. I have embiid, Simmons, and harris; giannis, middleton, and jrue; harden, Kyrie, and KD; bam, butler, and oladipo; Zion, Ingram, and lonzo; CP3, Booker, and Ayton; Jokic, Murray, and MPJ; Dame, CJ, and Powell; Steph, dray, and Klay; Lebron, AD, and Schroeder all as better big 3s"
"Four of the next five players drafted after Jaxson Hayes make that pick look terrible - Hachimura, Cam Johnson, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro."
"I literally just went on your sub and searched tyler herro and jimmy butler and was greeted with many hate posts, one named “jimmy butler is a disgrace, trashcan” so no. Just admit your sub is like every other sub and hates on players sometimes, its normal"
Plus the Tyler Herro kids. It became cool to wear his jersey almost out of fashion over ball.
We got Tyler “Bubble” Herro back and I think it’s got something to do with his bowl cut?
Tyler Herro looks like Eleven from Stranger Things with that haircut
Tyler Herro stans wya?
Random comparison to make...I feel like I know nothing about the other NBA sophmores drafted after Tyler (at least from r/nba) since all people talk about are Herro and occasionally Thybulle if he gets a cool steal and dunk.
"literally no reliable sources have said anything like this, everything from within the Heat have said they're in love with his work ethic.  &gt;The time is always now with us and if you have the right leadership with Jimmy and Goran and UD, then young players can be all about now. … Tyler, he was a teenager when we started this bubble, and he’s totally different now from even where he was in January. Because of the way he approaches it and works, he will continue to get remarkably better fast.

&gt; be white  Is that why the Heat are concerned about his nightlife?   https://sports.yahoo.com/report-heat-concerned-tyler-herro-191203649.html
Is this hate? Tyler herro shooting good as hell lately.
It’s true I’m tyler Herro
"It is but interesting enough. Bam without Jimmy 987 minutes 114 defensive rating, Jimmy without Bam 644 minutes 107 defensive rating. Jimmy and Bam 1154 minutes 109 defensive rating. So the stats say that Jimmy is consistently their best defensive player this season. He is also 1st in steals, tied for 3rd in defensive loose balls recovered, 3rd in deflections per game, 4th in defensive rating of 105.4. Dude has been a beast defensively. Not to mention the Heat are top 5 defence despite guys like Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn and Goran Dragic playing heavy minutes."

"""Like 5 times"" it's called hyperbole. Man your brain power is just off the charts. Tyler Herro fans all go to MIT"
If you want we can go and cherry pick games from Tyler Herro this year
Quick is a word that has never described Tyler Herro lol
"Tyler ""Mose Schrute"" Herro put out the Celtics to pasture."
Tyler Herro is the first “Strand-type” player
Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo are officially the owners of the Boston Celtics.
"Tyler Herro just has Markus Smarts number, it’s so odd he guards Bam and Jimmy well but he can’t stay on Tyler at all."
"Point guard Tyler Herro leading both teams in rebounds, while shooting well from 2 and from 3. How bout that"
"[Flashback to last playoffs when the Celtics wanted us so badly to beat Milwaukee so we'd play 'em in the ECF.](https://np.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/ilfrhl/more_nervous_about_heat_in_the_ecf_than_bucks/)  Now we've effectively ended their season in back-to-back years. Granted, anything can happen - but even if the Celtics survive the play-in games they're asking for a humiliating 4/5-game series at the ends of Philly/Brooklyn, and it came at the hands of Tyler Herro and Goran Dragic yet again. Life comes at you fast."
Tyler Herro fucking hates the Celtics huh
Tyler Herro?
"Vogel’s defensive gameplanning coupled with the best defense in the league was the main factor in Book (and CP3) underperforming the other night.  The Lakers have done an excellent job at containing guards dating back to last post season.  They were able to contain Dame, Harden and Murray. And they completely picked apart Westbrook, CJ, and a hot Tyler Herro.  I think it should be expected that neither Book or CP3 will have amazing series. And one of them is likely gonna have a bad series."
Yep that was what maybe attracted me the most to the Heat. Tyler Herro being the youngest player to ever start in an NBA Finals match was something I thought was incredible and especially reminded me of De Ligt being the youngest player in a Europa League final! Can’t wait to hopefully travel to Miami sometime and catch some games in the AA Arena when this pandemic is over!
Hope Tyler Herro comes ready to play or it’s a first round exit have fun playing the nets or bucks
Tyler Herro
Shit is it worth it to trade Tyler “37 points in the Conference Finals” Herro for the strip club guy tho? Hmmm
Tyler Herro
&gt; I'd probably go in order from best to worst  &gt; 1. Tyler Herro  Had to stop there. LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bruh this place is worse than Twitter sometimes.
Tyler Herro&gt; though......  Hehe
You want people to bully you like Tyler Herro did your cousin??
"Everyone saying Trae, but I already considered him to be bald and ineligible for this question.   I'd be okay with Tyler Herro going bald just so we don't have to see those haircuts anymore."
Bro Tyler Herro only goes off against us 😭😭
Nah he’s happy with the goat Tyler Herro lmfao
I know one player that’s not on the table   Tyler Herro
because they thought he would be there at 14  and you [could've heard the story](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/nba-rumors-tyler-herro-blew-away-celtics-impressive-workout) [before the draft](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-rumors-celtics-believed-serious-221302540.html)
"The Kings pick was literally a coin flip away from turning into Tyler Herro, who would have fit in perfectly on this team"
"If Tyler Herro scores 40PPG vs the Nets in the ECF, does he become a Top 5 white NBA player of All-Time?"
Tyler Herro
As a Heat fan- Tyler Herro
"Tyler Herro, the walking bucket"
"RJ Barrett most surprising in terms of his jump in efficiency.  I wouldn't say most disappointing, but I think Ja Morant has been relatively disappointing in the sense that he hasn't made a jump from rookie year to sophomore year, he kinda just stayed stagnant. Also maybe Tyler Herro, big things was expected of him after his play in the playoffs last season but he hasn't made a jump either."

"You call a lucky run in a bubble building a team to compete? And what happened in those finals? You lost and didn’t win the title, just like the 28 other teams didn’t either. Unless you got the ring, silence please. And unlike Miami, the Wolves actually have to build a winner. Not buy one through free agency with the nice weather and friendly tax laws. The East is locked down between Brooklyn, Bucks, and Philly. Congrats, y’all built a team that half competed but won’t get over the hump. The Wolves have Towns and Edwards, a lot more promise than Tyler Herro and Bam. Enjoy being the 4/5 seed for the next 6 years while we build a team from the ground up that will win a championship."
He also couldn’t wait to mention KAT was the leading scorer but didn’t want to mention Tyler Herro has just as many points as KAT while coming off the bench and playing less minutes after missing six straight games
"Maybe if he traded for players who could hit jump shots, zion could go to work down there? Instead, this moron traded for Steven Adams ($29 m, and a $19 m extension coming, signed off again by this same moron), Eric Bledsoe ($16 m), and James Johnson ($16 m).   This guy also drafted a lane clogging center in Jaxson Hayes at 8 over Tyler Herro.   Whose idea of a lineup combinations of the following is a good idea:  Zion.  Adams.   Ingram  .       .   Hayes.    Johnson . Bledsoe.   Ball Lewis.   .   Hart?  What possible lineup is going to give proper spacing?   They could have gotten into the Turner for Hayward SnT and send picks to Boston, or they could have just sent #4 for him to Indy after the AD trade. But, this idiot thinks he has the magic touch with drafting.   Yes, zion is getting hacked. But it's partially your fault because of incompetence. Maybe he'll stfu and hire someone who doesn't eat glue and then let that person make personnel decisions for him."
"How does ""Simon's Herro Ball""  have an elite defending backcourt? Legit the only positive defender in that lineup is Simmons. Tyler and Donovan are bad and Ant and Sabonis are horrendous."
But Tyler Herro is better amirite?
Tyler Herro looks like an asshole. I firmly believe the way someone lives affects the way they look.
tyler herro lol
"Tyler Herro is in the NBA vaccination commercial, Katya in shambles"
1st question: Did you and Tyler Herro scissor?
Your cousin could do the most upvoted ama in this sub’s history.   AMA: Tyler Herro beat me up in high school because I like apple cinnamon oatmeal.
He beat your cousin up? Fuck Tyler herro
"Tyler Herro is destroying Miami's season because of his lifestyle. Some news of it is out, but there's a lot more to it and it's only going to get worse. This is the same guy that used to beat up my cousin in high school"
"That’s really great.  Yeah shooters help a lot haha.   For us Jimmy plays hard, but I know his life was made easier last year with Duncan, Tyler Herro, and Goran dragic spacing the floor  So it’s definitely cool to see what an mvp candidate in Embiid can do. Good luck in the playoffs and give the Nets hell!!"
"Murray’s certainly weren’t, and without his nuclear bubble performance the Nuggets don’t beat the Clippers.   Again. The bubble will be studied years from now for the flukes it allowed given the setting and keeping a bunch of professional athletes locked up and not allowed to live their lives.   TJ Warren, Tyler Herro, Murray and more. All bubble creations to an extent."
Tyler ‘Tyrone’ Herro is truly the embodiment of #HeatCulture^TM
"I was going to make a joke about Tyler Herro, but then I saw Ayton and I just don’t understand. That literally wouldn’t make sense.   You would think they would have enough clickbait with just Herro"
Kevin Love and Tyler Herro belong on the all-scrub team this year
[Miami reportedly open to James Harden trade; Tyler Herro not untouchable](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/12/miami-reportedly-open-to-james-harden-trade-tyler-herro-not-untouchable/)  Will this social media circlejerk that the Heat wouldn't trade Herro for Harden ever end? Not even a Heat fan but you have to be so dumb to think that is true. Nobody ever even reported that was the case.
[Miami reportedly open to James Harden trade; Tyler Herro not untouchable](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/12/miami-reportedly-open-to-james-harden-trade-tyler-herro-not-untouchable/)
Learns fluent Spanish.....Ricky and Juancho get traded in the off season for Tyler Herro
"&gt;I wish the Heat gave up Herro  *Still* makes me LMAO. I mean, the Heat didn't have enough to get Harden anyway, but acting like Tyler Herro was untouchable is just riotously hilarious."
A massive part of it is how genuinely awful Bledsoe was. He was our third option and a borderline all star in the regular season so when he goes completely ice cold it’s a big loss and he became a liability to even have on the floor. Another big part of it is how hot Miami and Toronto’s shooters got. Fred VanVleet and Norman Powell were absolutely unguardable in our series. Same with Tyler Herro and even Jae Crowder in the Miami series. I’m just saying you have to look at things with context because a lot of things that caused us to lose are not the norm whatsoever
"Yeah, Bam has had Jimmy Butler, Tyler Herro, Andre Igoudala, Dwyane Wade on his team, while KAT's best form of help in his entire career is Andrew fucking wiggins. It's like saying Jrue Holiday is a better player than Lavine because of success"
"I don’t know after watching Celtics v Heat in game 4, I seriously think Tyler Herro could soon reach Luka’s and Zion’s level. He shoots really well but there’s just something he lacks that I can’t quite put my finger on, but I think he’s one breakthrough away from being a star player."
When Tyler Herro scores.
"So many reasons, but one that jumps to mind is that several of the most entertaining, and best, young players (Jokic, Giannis, Luka) didn't go to college in the US. The NBA doesn't know how to build up its stars as well as the NCAA. And, so these guys come in without a natural fan base.   The top draws in the league are Steph (by far), then probably LeBron and Zion. LaMelo might get there. It's instructive to reflect on how quickly Tyler Herro rose to stardom - people love a 'home-grown' talent to root for."
"Man I know that I'm biased but I really am beginning to doubt that LA can get through the west this year. Obviously Bron will turn it up a bit come June but even with Bron and AD in the lineup they aren't the best team in the west.   Bron and co might fuck around and prove the mickey mouse theory true. I can only imagine the ammo that would give the MJ stans, i can hear it already:   &gt;he went to LA, missed the playoffs, forced AD to strongarm his way west a year early and then won a mickey mouse ring against Tyler Herro and Jimmy Buffet at a hotel with no fans present. After that they lost to a fat white guy after barely making the play in. This is your goat? He's a fraud"
"Man people just love to bring Herro up when comparing a young prospect lol  Tyler isn’t even playing rn and just minding his business   For how much some of y’all think he’s trash, overrated, y’all sure bring him up a lot"
I made a whole spreadsheet before realizing I forgot to take position into account.  Top 5 scoring teams are as follows if we're playing positionless and/or small-ball:  |*Team MB -  79.9 PPG*|*Team DB -  77.6 PPG*|*Team JH -  76.5 PPG*|*Team BB -  76.1 PPG*|*Team TH -  72.4 PPG* | |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Malcolm Brogdon - 21.2|Devin Booker - 25.4|James Harden - 25.2 |Bradley Beal - 31.3|Tobias Harris - 20| |Malik Beasley - 19.6|Dillon Brooks - 16.7|Jrue Holiday - 17.3 |Bojan Bogdanovic - 15.7|Tim Hardaway Jr. - 16| |Marvin Bagley III - 13.9|Darius Bazley - 13.4|Joe Harris - 14.5 |Bogdan Bogdanovic - 15.2|Tyler Herro - 14.9| |Mikal Bridges - 13.1|Davis Bertans - 11.4|Justin Holiday - 10.3 |Bruce Brown - 8.8|Tyrese Haliburton - 12.8| |Miles Bridges - 12.1|Dwayne Bacon - 10.7|Josh Hart - 9.2|Bismack Biyombo - 5.1|Talen Horton-Tucker - 8.7|
Tyler Herro  Tyrese Haliburton  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Talen Horton-Tucker  Tobias Harris  lol. no active big available
"&gt;Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.  Ok, those people don’t speak for me.  &gt;And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now. We’ve also had plenty of games where we’ve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.  You haven’t had “many games” with zero stars on the court. That’s just a blatant lie.  &gt;Just seems like you’re a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining.   I’m not a hater at all. I actually really want you guys to win since Harden is one of my favourite players of all time. It would physically pain me to see him retire without a ring. I’m also perfectly fine with him doing it on a superteam considering he got cock blocked by a different superteam multiple times.  I’m fine with superteams. I just don’t think building a superteam makes Marks the best executive in the league. It just means 3 guys wanted to play together. Just because I don’t agree that Marks is the outright best executive in the league that doesn’t make me a hater.   &gt;If you’re not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you’re just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped.  I have no idea why you keep bringing up the Warriors when I’ve literally never mentioned them.   I have given him credit for those moves. However, those moves specifically are not sufficient enough to declare him the best executive in the league. Drafting some decent role players doesn’t make him the best executive in the league. Denver is out here drafting Jokic in the second round and MPJ at pick 14. That’s not even mentioning Murray and Beasley.   Then you have the Raptors with Siakam (27th pick), OG (23rd pick), Norm (second round), FVV (undrafted).  Then you have the Heat who drafted a bonafide all star in Bam (pick 14), Herro, Robinson etc.  Sorry for thinking Marks is “only” a top 5-10 executive. Guess that makes me a hater lol"
"Alex Caruso, Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Kevin Love, Gordon Hayward, Sam Dekker etc"
they literally dropped two games to a team whose second best player was 19-year old rookie tyler herro

Tyler Herro is better based off of basketball tings
"Tyler Herro is going to be really good, and most people on here aren't giving the same shit to other players who live a lavish lifestyle."
"Damn you are a hater, you were just waiting for a game like this to happen   if you want I can pull up one about how Tyler herro is just not good cause he has had many games like this"
Garrison Mathews is what the Heat hoped Tyler Herro would be
You people say it's a top heavy draft every single year and then get shocked the next year when guys like Tyler Herro and Immanuel Quickley are good players.  You only knowing the names of 5 college players doesn't make it a 5-man draft.
This sub makes it hard to view anyone as overrated.  Any decent player who receives some attention will have naysayers.  I'd probably go with Tyler Herro as he's been a disappointment this season relative to expectations.  Although I think what he's going thru is fairly common for most sophomores.
"[Kevin O’Connor of The Ringer reported Sunday that the Miami Heat are “pursuing a deal for Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry harder than anyone.” He added that if Lowry gets dealt, his preferred destination would be to Miami due to his friendship with Jimmy Butler.](https://www.hothothoops.com/2021/3/21/22343686/miamj-heat-kyle-lowry-trade-duncan-robinson-tyler-herro-kelly-olynyk-lamarcus-aldridge)  [Lowry's top destination if he is traded is reportedly Miami, Tim Reynolds of the Associated Press reported Tuesday.](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-kyle-lowry-prefers-miami-heat-as-trade-destination)  cry more 🤡  he gone (just like every star in Raptor history) + Masai is washed"
"&gt;called Tyler Herro ""Kuzma of the east"" and that's pretty much accurate  What does it mean???"
"Some weeks ago someone called Tyler Herro ""Kuzma of the east"" and that's pretty much accurate, I don't think they have Lost depth, but both Herro and Robinson who were amazing on that Celtics series last year have been Very disappointing this season."
"Butler and Adebayo are still playing like stars.  Pretty much everyone else has fallen off for various reasons, in large part due to injury and illness and lack of continuity.    Duncan Robinson in particular has struggled even as he's played the most minutes on the team, perhaps because almost everyone around him has missed time.  Even his free throw shooting percentage is down from last year.    Just as Robinson was playing better he left the Bulls game last night due to illness.  That leaves the Heat with little backcourt depth, with Victor Oladipo, Kendrick Nunn, and Tyler Herro all out.  They also miss Jae Crowder, who was an underrated veteran presence especially in the playoffs.  Crowder has been a valuable player for the Suns this season.  If everyone gets healthy they are still a threat in the East, but time is getting short, and they are going to have a rough road in the playoffs.    Last year they had the benefit of months off before the bubble.  That's not happening this year."
Kcp is way better than Tyler herro lmao
Tyler Herro is poo poo caca.
The list was extremely clouded by recency bias and i think anyone with a mind of their own knows ESPN has influence but most of what they write is shit  Tyler Herro has been catching stray bullets from this list all year
Tyler Herro lmaaaaaaaaaaoooooo
Hints of Tyler herro lmaooo nice dunk by Mann but that was hilarious 😂
Straight up to the heat for Tyler Herro
How could you leave off the Shanghai MVP Tyler Herro?
Ben Simmons for Tyler Herro. Who says no?
"It's okay, he's no Tyler Herro"
"Actually, you’re right. I’m going to spam Tyler Herro was robbed of ROTY last year because he won us a bunch of games and my eye test tells us all that he had the better campaign than Ja or Zion. Who cares that the advanced stats would prove me otherwise"
"This was very on par for playing vs. the Bucks though. Bud's scheme has a history of leaving role players wide open on the corner, and Jeff Green was absolutely abusing Brook's refusal to leave the paint. He's just another FVV or Tyler Herro to us. At a certain point when the same thing keeps happening, it's not a coincidence."
Because Heat are bubble frauds who's best player shot 28% in the playoffs and Tyler Herro got his girl pregnant (meaning no more sleep and he will get even worse)  💯💯💯
There was also a poll on Twitter on a Heat fan account and like 51% didn't want to trade Tyler Herro for James fucking Harden lol. Also i remember looking at the Sixers sub back then and most people were fine with trading only Ben Simmons for Harden but pretty much everyone disagreed if Tyrese Maxey or Shake Milton was included lol
Two words. Tyler Herro.
Pretty dick move that he did here. Recruited to Jimmy Butler to the Heat so his Jazz wouldn’t have to play the Clippers or Lakers with Butler in the playoffs. Now Jimmy is stuck playing with Tyler Herro instead of Kawhi Leonard.
"I dunno, he maybe loading up to resign Tyler Herro."
"Ah the new Tyler Herro-Harden trade despite the fact that Fertitta was the reason Harden isn’t on the Sixers.  Also, Harden might be hurt."
Which still isn't as much as the difference between Tyler Herro and James Harden.
&gt; or Tyler Herro now?  T_T
"Woah woah woah now, Tyler Herro is bringing it back."
Are we talking about the Denver fan still or Tyler Herro now?
Number 27 got that yeeyee tyler herro bullshit haircut
Tyler Herro keeps up the Mavs desire to have white stars dunno what else they need
Lmao “it was just LED screens” s/o to the ballroom goons. Tyler Herro I’m looking at you.
"Ah, I see. He trusts in the guy that wouldn't trade Tyler Herro and Kendrick Nunn for James Harden. Makes perfect sense 😂"
Somebody said they fapping to this instead of jaye summers...She looks like Tyler Herro...this sub is weird man.
"Bubble was trash. Couple players opted out, some injured, no fans, no travel. Glorified open runs. Guys like TJ Warren &amp; Tyler Herro were playing like hall of farmers. Even Tatum &amp; Lillard said it didn’t feel like NBA basketball. Fans and traveling play a factor in playoff games. You see dudes missing free throws because of fans it matters going on the road. It was the lowest viewed finals in 10+ years."
 Tyler Herro is the blackest white guy in the league  Michael Conley is the whitest black guy in the league   The perfect yin yang
"The 13th pick is always an interesting one, too. Karl Malone (1985), Jalen Rose (1994), Kobe (1996), Zach LaVine (2014), Devin Booker (2015), and Donovan Mitchell (2017).   Also some recent guys with decent careers so far, from Ed Davis (2010) to Markieff Morris (2011) to Kelly Olynyk (2013) to Tyler Herro (2019).  Fair share of duds though, with Papagiannis (2016), Kendall Marshall (2012), Jerome Robinson (2018), and most of the 2000s picks save Richard Jefferson and Thabo."
"Also Tyler Herro. It's a mixture of that cringey snarl, and Heat fans pretending that they weren't posting Herro/Booker rookie stat comparisons all the time last year and acting like that was only a media narrative. Nothing against him personally, I just really enjoy watching cocky fans get taken down a peg lol"
Sixth man Tyler Herro too
Woj reported that Tyler Herro and Randle will be joining him too. Sick of all these fucking superteams man
Tyler Herro  Source: https://youtu.be/Q5vaqPSI_ME
Nah. Bubble doesnt count. Unless you believe Jimmy Butler has proven he can be the best player on a title squad and Tyler Herro is the next Devin Booker.
"Watching Devin Booker, Steph Curry, and Elfrid Peyton highlights 😈😈 that's who I model my game after 💯💯🏀✊🏽🙏🏽  — Tyler Herro"
Remember when [Tyler Herro tried to do this](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ll8f5p/heats_tyler_herro_tries_to_sneak_in_practice_free/) and they counted it and everyone clowned him? Guess rules don’t apply the same to stars.   Though to be fair Herro’s was more egregious.
I know it's not the same exact situation but for the purposes of jokes:   Tyler Herro in shambles
"As a finals team...? The starting line up for Game 3 of the NBA finals were Jimmy Butler, Duncan Robinson, Jae Crowder, Tyler Herro and Meyers Leonard. With Nunn, 36 year old iggy and Olynyk off the bench...The starting line up was literally Jimmy, Crowder and 3 white guys that play absolutely no defence"
Didn't tyler herro try this in the bubble and it counted?
Yeah I remember that. That was Tyler Herro
Those Bucks fans remind me of Tyler Herro
"nets missing harden/jg and having the worst shooting night of their season and the bucks still cant beat them, why the fuck was bud kept after getting swept by tyler herro"
tyler herro vibes
Bryn forbes channeling his inner tyler herro
Tyler Herro
Did Tyler Herro intentionally regress to earn a role on Space Jam 2?
Lmao at this Tyler Herro vs Paul George  poll  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2Mw9UsXsAAFDow?format=jpg&amp;name=small  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2cSSD0WQAA7Mah?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900
Tyler Herro better
"""See, he's a liability to his team.  Overrated defender, awful offense.  I want him traded for tyler herro right now"""
• Tyler Herro this playoffs: 9-3-2 on 31/31/100 splits  • MJ this playoffs:
Tyler Herro exists
Tyler Herro was killin in the bubble that’s why it doesn’t count to me
"Kevin ""Bubble Tyler Herro"" Huerter"
Is Huerter this years Tyler Herro?
Kevin Huerter is who Tyler Herro thinks he is
Huerter growing out of his “Swaggerless Tyler Herro” nickname
Lmao idk why I always expected him to talk like Tyler Herro. Maybe the fade tricked me
Damn... Tyler Herro in shambles
And to think this all coukd have been avoided if the Heat had been willing to trade Tyler “Bubble boy” Herro
"""Next Jordan"" like Tyler Herro"
"Well...Tyler Herro is a franchise corner stone.  To be fair, I don't think that Milwaukee had anyone to trade for Harden."
Tyler Herro and Nunn  for   Giannis and Cash consideration  who says no
It makes me hate the Heat even more because they didn't want to give up Tyler Herro in the Harden trade. That allowed the nets to acquire him.
"Trade Tyler Herro for Giannis, who says no?"
"Hold on a minute here. You telling me you don’t want a used Tyler Herro, former runner-up rookie of the year Kendrick Nunn and our shitty 2026 first? Come on man."
"-Heat fan, fanbase that tried to convince people Tyler Herro was the next Dwayne Wade  Knicks fans haven't even been that ridiculous about any of our players lmao"
"Who’s getting screwed? Serious question, I think both those dudes suck. McCollum is a black hole and RJ Barrett put up basically the same numbers per 36 as Tyler Herro. A team that’s win now like the Knicks are pretending to be would probably prefer the established volume scorer. The rebuild would probably prefer the 20 year old. If it’s a matter of making the salaries match, I figured Noel would get them to the 80% or whatever."
"Butler stonks are down, as are LeBron's, after reaching all time high last Finals.  Trae Young made an unexpected rally and is a hot commodity again after being hated nearly a whole season.  Tyler Herro did essentially the opposite. After a great launch, he is on a strong downtrend.  Luka stonks remain high, but he has yet to experience an /r/NBA bear market in popularity. I'd be wary praising Luka next season he might soon be the bad guy.  As usual sell Pat Bev and buy D Rose."
Do you think Tyler Herro is a star?
"Here's the funny thing, people just rip it because it's different and it's the easiest 1-to-1 you can make without empirically giving an example of why bubble basketball could never happen in a ""normal basketball situation"".  ""Tyler Herro scored 37 pts in a ECF game""  yea - and Meyers Leonard scored 30 pts in a WCF game against the Super Warriors. It's not exactly absurd for a shooter to catch absurd fire. Frequent? No, but it has happened.   Ultimately, the Lakers were far and away the best team in 2020. Everyone gassed up each of their West opponents and then they extinguished them.  People can poke more holes in our run ""would the Heat have gone up 2-0 on the Bucks/Celtics playing road games"". Maybe? Maybe not? But at the end of the day it happened, soooooooo"
Tyler Herro put up 16 ppg on like 56 TS% in the bubble playoffs. Basically prime MJ
Level playing field though so what was the problem?   What scrubs played like prime MJ? TJ Warren had a strong start but Jimmy Butler and the Heat defence had no problems dealing with him when that series came around. Tyler Herro is a talented player who can get really hot sometimes.
Bubble Tyler Herro 🔥
"No. I think if Tyler Herro pulls his shit together he could be the starting point guard on a championship contender, but that's as close to a positive answer as I can give to this question."
"Tyler Herro is an elite scoring talent, it's like saying Devin Booker or Zach Lavine can't be your #1 scorer on a championship level team."
"Tyler Herro absolutely can be your #1 scoring option on a championship caliber team, but that doesn't mean that he will be the best player on said team."
"I mean at the time it wasn't out of the ordinary, but I could very easily name 20 players from that class that I would rather have. It doesn't help that the three players picked after him were Cameron Johnson, P.J. Washington, and Tyler Herro. Pretty good crop. Cam has dealt with injury though, and has shown flashes through his career. It could completely turn around for him if he became more consistent on offense."
Hes  going to Miami for Tyler herro . Dunno if heat take the bait tho
"He’s no Tyler Herro, that’s for sure."
"You’re right, I don’t. All I am going off of is the history of how these things usually pan out. They could be completely different. They probably aren’t, but hey, your right, I don’t actually *know* for sure.  And if your going to read, then read everything. I said *at that age* 5 years (it’s actually 6, I was wrong) is a big gap. How do I know? Because I’m 26 too, and I know from experience that 20 year old girls are nowhere near as mature as I am. Tyler Herro has literally 2 years of life experience outside of highschool. They are at completely different levels of maturity."
"Because they beat the ghost of Jimmy Butler, Tyler Herro and Jimmy Neutron."
Tyler “I’m better than Harden” Herro?
"Dude has 12 million dollars guaranteed in his contract. If he gets 6 mill of that after taxes and agent fees and never works again or invests he’ll still be able to live on $150,000 a year for the next 4 decades. And that’s assuming he won’t get another contract which is exceedingly unlikely.   More importantly, who are you to question who Tyler is with? Do you know him? Do you know her? Comments like these are misogynistic and disrespectful towards Herro as well. I will never understand why people in this subreddit will proudly comment shit they would never say to the player’s face. Have some respect for others and yourself."
"Literally him, Tyler Herro"
"Tyler Herro, he managed to get a shot to go in, just not in the basket"
I think it's just a Lakers/Heat fan thing. They always overhype these role players as superstars or stars and they in the playoffs they just get exposed. People were comparing Kuzma to Bron/Kobe and said he was a better prospect than Tatum. People were comparing Tyler Herro to Dwayne Wade and some Heat fans thought Harden wasn't good enough to give up Herro in a trade for. It's just big market stuff
Tyler Herro by Jack Harlow?
Ben Gordon isn’t a great player comparison for many modern guys. He lacked ball handling and operated cooly in the midrange in addition to being a microwave from three.  The player that most resembles Gordon is probably Tyler Herro.
I wouldn't trade either of them for Tyler Herro.
Tyler Herro and Kuzma became influencers
Tyler Herro. Top 10 in China.
- Anthony Davis - Julius Randle - Devine Booker - KAT - Rajon Rondo - Nerlens Noel - Tyler Herro - Bam Adebayo - Jamal Murray - Tyrese Maxey
But not for Tyler Herro.
Tyler Herro of the west
"Hey man lets be real here, Tyler Herro was another strong contender for MVP for the bucks too."
"Damn it, I thought he was working with the Heat staff  Wanted him to locked himself in the gym with Tyler Herro to improve his defense"
The white Tyler Herro.
"Definitely the same casuals who make ""Imagine not trading Tyler Herro/Tyrese Maxey for Harden"" comments."
Him and Tyler Herro
Calling Kuzma the Herro of the West is now disrespectful to Tyler Herro
"Philly is probably the only real landing spot for Kyle. Miami still believes in Tyler Herro and they won’t give him up in a sign n trade, they’re also losing Duncan Robinson and some other key pieces."
Tyler Herro
Who's ready for 2022 Finals Tyler Herro v. Dejounte Murray
I think YOU should be asking yourself what draft picks to trade because your GM thought Harden wasnt good enough for Tyler Herro 🤣
Michael Tyler Herro Jordan 🥶
Tyler Herro for Portland.
"just because he was a bench player in 2012 doesn't mean he didn't have a big role + play terrible in the road games in the finals.   You're ignoring him choking in elimination games in 2013  &gt;2015 lmao you’re brushing off an entire fucking playoff run because Josh smith and Corey Brewer made a couple threes  they didn't just hit a couple threes lmao the rockets season was over until harden got benched and brewer and smith combined for 29 points in the 4th quarter, and erased the 17 point lead the clippers built because harden was playing like ass (in an elimination game. Color me shocked)  &gt;(2015) I know you didn’t even watch but go back and look at games 1 and 2 at Oracle. Harden is doing everything hitting big shot after big shot... He was good in that series overall and only had 2 bad games  He still continued his trend of being horrific in elimination games. And ""only"" having 2 bad games in a 5 game series is pretty significant. Also, terrible/horrific/awful is a more accurate description of his 2 ""bad"" games.  &gt;(2017) Also, he had a concussion.  Lmao yeah totally man. The way rocket fans cope is pathetic. 0 evidence of this + he was so concussed that [he was caught in the club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJSuJ0B5pzE) (notice the flashing lights lol) the night of his game 6 choke  &gt;2018 Jesus Christ you can’t possibly blame him losing to 4 allstars as the only one?  I certainly put some blame on him for blowing double digit halftime leads in both games 6 and 7 + disappearing in the 4th quarter of G6.  2020 you're ignoring him continuing his trend of choking in elimination games (this time game 7 vs OKC) again. And yeah he was good in the first 3 quarters in games from the lakers series until he disappeared in the 4th.  tyler herro put up 19/6/5 on the celtics on 63% TS in the ecf last year btw, including a 37 point game. Congrats to harden on being able to put up good numbers on walking BBQ chicken known as Evan Fournier and the ghost of Kemba Walker."
"For the whole off-season it’s gonna be giannis. But tyler herro, booker, gobert"
"And just so we have the best arena music we should get John Wall, Tyler Herro, Mo Bamba and Halleluka!"
1 Sabonis   2 Lillard   3 Chris Paul   4 Jamal Murray   5 Bradley Beal   6 Jimmy Butler   7 Tyler Herro   8 Cameron Payne   9 Rudy Gobert    10 Julius Randle
"Before the season, Tyler Herro. The amount of Heat fans saying that they wouldn't trade Herro for Harden is still hilarious to me."
I demand a recount for my homie Tyler Herro  https://i.imgur.com/QGqyFhQ.jpg
"They way people talk about this team make it seem as if players like Jeff Teague, Kyle Kuzma or Tyler Herro or on this team. When I’m reality we have fucking KD, Dame, Draymond, Tatum and LaVine. No other team has even half the talent we have"
"Tyler Herro: ""bippity boppity, give me the zoppity"""
that sounds fair. also can we have tyler herro for lebron james and anthony davis?
Tyler herro
I hear Tyler Herro is available. Might even be able to get Tyrese Maxey in a 3 team trade. With one used Ben Simmons added in.
Seattle gets a team again.  Emoni Bates is a top-3 player in the league.  Tyler Herro failed attempt at a rap career.  Surprise superstar duo Mac McClung and Julian Newman lead the Sacremento Kings back to the playoffs but lose 4-0 in the finals to the Ball Brothers who all (yes LiAngelo too) reunite with Okongwu in Charlotte.
They should send Jimmy Nichols and Tyler Herro to Portland for Dame
Tyler Herro.
Too early to say Tyler Herro?
"Devin Booker. Touted as the next Kobe Bryant, which is kind of disrespectful to Kobe seeing as he played on both ends of the floor. He has never led his team to the playoffs before CP3 came along. Overall I think he's a good offensive player, like the other 85% of players in the league. Really nothing special.  Also, before anyone says the Suns went 8-0 in the Bubble, the Bubble made Tyler Herro and the Miami Heat look like the second coming of Michael Jordan and the '96 Bulls."
How about Tyler herro? He’d benefit a lot from playing with these guys
Tyler Herro
"Heat also have Herro and Robinson and I can see Tyler Herro being a star in the next 2 years.  The Hawks also have Hunter who could be a star.  If the Hawks can upgrade some of their good players for a great player, they won’t have to worry about not being able to pay everyone which is their only roadblock."
Then again you'll have to play with Tyler Herro so it might as well be Tulsa.
"I'm a long time Cavs fan but even I know that Garland has no way to be a top 2 player in that draft. How do you expect a slight, averagely-athletic undersized PG to be better than a 6'7"" prime Shaq-like player or a taller/lankier prime-DRose-like player in Ja? Like Chris Paul is an outlier but usually the rule is players with Garland's body type cant be a superstar in a league with the Giannis, AD's, SGA, PG, Doncic of the world.    Not only that but arguably not only with those two shining above the rest but some of the player pool of the likes of RJ, De'Andre, Reddish, Cam Johnson and especially Tyler Herro are likely to outshine DG because he can't do some of the things the bigger guys can do. But hey the Cavs could have drafted worse, so DG will be key in the rebuild."
You misspelled tyler herro
I thought the idea of trading Tyler Herro for Harden would’ve been dumb…. ffs
Saw some dude wearing a Tyler Herro jersey when I went to game 3. Like dude. What.
How about lebrons ring vs tyler herro..
One of my friends was convinced during the bubble that Tyler herro was a much better player than Middleton and we needed to trade everything we have to get him because he’s extremely clutch and Middleton isn’t. I’ve definitely heard worse takes but that one is pretty awful and I love how poorly that already shitty take has aged
Tyler Herro in shambles
Tyler Herro
"[Miami reportedly open to James Harden trade; Tyler Herro not untouchable](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/12/miami-reportedly-open-to-james-harden-trade-tyler-herro-not-untouchable/#:~:text=The%20Heat%20would%20have%20interest,in%20granting%20his%20trade%20request%E2%80%A6&amp;text=But%20the%20source%20disputed%20any,untouchable)  Had no draft picks to trade at the time so luckily we dodged the Frauden bullet. Bradley Beal Damian Lillard or Zach Lavine will be requesting a trade here any day now btw 😁"
"Booker is next up on the Tyler herro, Jamal Murray list"
"Lmao, you put Jamal Murray and Tyler Herro in the same class. kekw.  Solid bait post 5/7"
Booker is just another Tyler Herro and Jamal Murray. Wait for next year. Sucks because you won't see him in the finals ever again to prove I'm right..
Idk but Tyler Herro has to be at the top of the list
Josh Magette is who Tyler Herro thinks he’s is
Lmao he was literally the worst rated lottery pick that year and people quickly said we made a major mistake by drafting him instead of T-Rex arms Tyler Herro. Cam was a 6’8” player who was the best shooter in his draft and going to a rotation to play next to devin booker. It was a perfect match no matter what knock you have on him as a player
"Damn, that Argentine 14 is their version of Tyler Herro"
Ay yo Tyler Herro is in the game for Argentina
Tyler Herro/ Tyrese Haliburton/ Jordan Poole/ Deonte Burton/ Kevon Loney  You could add Wes Matthews/ Frank Kaminsky as starters/bench guys.  Man that team would be bad.
We shall give you Tyler Herro and Iggy and a 2nd round pick
"Pascal was better.  Rap fans thinking there getting Simmons for a free agent Kyle LMAO   just like y’all thought you were getting thybulle maxey and firsts, or Tyler herro.  Get a fn grip.   I’ll hit you up when he signs somewhere and Toronto gets a box of donuts in return."
Oh god no. Duncan Robinson is probably one of the worst defenders in the league. Featuring Tyler Herro lol
"laker girl is too much, it would be like including tyler herro for harden."
"That was 2 years ago. Their 3 best scorers next year are 32, 36, and Tyler Herro took a big step back. I don’t think it’s fair to say this team is the same as what we saw in the bubble."
"&gt; Bust: Tyler Herro  I don't want to say it's a make it or break it season but really interested what he can do with a proper offseason. The talent is there but he's always been a 'high highs, low lows' player during his rookie season (yes, even pre-bubble).  One thing I want to see is his defense. He was also surprisingly good at poking at on-ball defenders for steals during his first 2 months but disappeared."
Breakout: De'Aaron Fox  Bust: Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro pulling for the Bucks at 0:13
Tyler Herro lol
One hit wonder so probably Tyler Herro
Should have taken Tyler Herro
ESPN also said that Derozan is the 82nd best player in the nba rn while Tyler herro is the 59th best
"trade tyler herro for dame, sign and trade iguodala for kawhi, and i guess to keep it realistic , snag luka from the mavs for kendrick nunn"
Tyler herro. ~~absolute no bias~~
"Tons of players will have a breakout season, so I'm not sure if you mean 'A breakout season' or 'the biggest breakout season.' Poole and Wiseman from the Warriors are 2 people I think will improve massively. Garland too, Ant will be great. MPJ will take a leap, Zion and Ja too.  It'd be funny if Tyler Herro suddenly became insanely good. This sub would be in shambles."
In before he hits a sophomore wall and has a down season and everyone starts shitting on him. Exhibit A: Tyler Herro.
"If Jrue Holiday drops out of the Olympics after this poor finals performance, who would replace him? Tyler Herro?"
You mean Tyler Herro isn't that guy?
"A catch and shoot player like JJ Redick does not have the credentials to talk shit about a future first ballot HoFer.    JJ Redick is just a blue blood Tyler Herro, change my mind"
"I, too, enjoy evaluating players solely based on recent playoff performances such as Tyler Herro who is better than Devin Booker.  /s"
Lol. I remember some of the Tyler Herro takes last year.
Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
"Ayton has had one playoffs.   I bet half of Reddit would have said last year:   for the playoffs: Tyler Herro; regular season: PG-13  Ayton has been better in these playoffs. Overall, at this point in their careers Gobert is a more valuable player. His ability to defend the basket (I know nobody cares about that because the last thing they saw was the Clips going small to beat him) is *much* better than anything Ayton does"
Wonder if Cam Johnson is the next Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro is the next Ben Simmons in terms of work ethic.
Tyler Herro
tyler herro
"You're probably right. Im imagining the rest of the roster filled with some of the other white American talent, kaminsky, reddick, Alex Caruso, Tyler Herro and I just feel like there is a lot of talent on that roster that could flourish with larger roles. I am also of the mind Love is capable of far more than what he has shown with the Cavs."
"Tyler Herro, Joe Harris, Kevin Huerter, Gordon Hayward, Kevin Love  TJ McConnell, Luke Kennard, Duncan Robinson, Dean Wade, Mason Plumlee  Alex Caruso, Grayson Allen, Garrison Matthews, Pat Connaughton, Cody Zeller"
man that is one headline  Tyler Herro massaging Pooh Shiesty when
Yeah him and Bam should join Giannis on the bucks.  Bam doesn’t deserve to be on that squad slumming it with Tyler “better than harden” herro in Miami.
Tyler Herro is Nigerian?
"3rd season Tyler Herro  He will finally have a full offseason, after a disappointing 2nd season I know he’ll want to prove the doubters wrong…let’s see if all the talk about him being a hard worker and having one of the best work ethics on the team is true   Honestly..If he doesn’t show much improvement in his 3rd season, I will jump off the Herro train    Also Post Olympics Bam should be exciting to watch"
"Where is Tyler Herro, he is a young talent as well."
Long as he don’t pull a tyler herro next season he cool

bogdan is who tyler herro thinks he is
It's a lot harder for him now people know he's a threat. The Tyler Herro effect.
It’s what happens when fans of a team get to attached to their players. Go read some of the Heat sub’s posts from before the Harden trade went down. There were a bunch of people saying they’d rather have Tyler Herro.
"People on here vastly overrate “potential.” Real life isn’t 2k where young players get better each year in a mostly linear fashion.   Along those lines, a lot of people fall in love with potential to the point where they value it over tangible and real production in the here and now which is completely bird brained.  I saw this line of thinking a lot with some of the more moronic heat and sixers fans on here when it came to the Harden trade. If you’re lucky and all of the stars align, Tyler Herro and Tyresse Maxey and all of those picks may—and I stress may—become maybe half the player that James Harden is. It’s pure mystery box thinking and it made me realize how delusional a lot of people on this sub are"
Bubble Tyler herro
&gt;At this point the Heat would be floored with that turnout because Tyler Herro looked really bad this past season.   No he didn't. He started the season in a slump but for the most looked like the player he was last season/playoffs
"Ben Simmons, especially after the 76ers series against us and Tyler Herro especially after the Bucks series"
"I believe it was dragic, Winslow and Tyler herro?"
Tyler Herro
Is Tyler Herro the most overhyped player in the last 20 years?
"At this point the Heat would be floored with that turnout because Tyler Herro looked really bad this past season.   Knicks would be extremely happy with that obviously, any team would.   Memphis needs JJJ to be better than that imo. He’s supposed to be their second best player"
"He is nice but also feel like he is being overhyped. Give the dude at the very minimum a FULL season before you rate him. He has potential for sure and if Rockets do it right, they got one hell of a player for peanuts.  I just don’t want this dude to get overhyped like Tyler Herro because of some amazing performances that he had, let the dude breathe and be realistic, give him a full season to show himself."
He's getting like 30 minutes a game no matter what.  Look at what someone like Tyler Herro was getting on the Heat his rookie year and literally no one would have drafted him over Trae.
Cool but like why is this nba news I guess I could understand like LeBron getting divorced being news because no one ever stops talking about him but Tyler herro? Who actually gives a fuck well that is mean but this is nba news? Really national basketball association news whatever maybe I'm being dumb
"I feel like Katya Elise Henry definitely makes more $ than Tyler Herro on a rookie contract. She has 8 mil IG followers. If she opened up an OnlyFans, she would instantly be adding a couple million annually to what she's already making with endorsements/ads."
Downvoted because you spoke the truth   If anyone ever says representation don't matter all you gotta do is point to the main demo of this sub collectively losing their shit with the emergence of Luka and Jokic lol  Imagine if Tyler Herro didn't come crashing back down to reality lmao
You mean when Tyler Herro becomes black Devin Booker
Miami wouldn’t even include Tyler Herro in the package.
"Heat alone had tyler herro, kendrick nunn, derrick jones jr, and duncan robinson all make the finals in their first post season"
He's no Tyler Herro.
"The Heat aren’t sneaky deep, they’re real fucking deep. The only thing sneaky about the Heat are their hands as they steal the rock from these chumps like a kid taking cookies from an unattended cookie jar. Y’all really thought we were an 8th seed or not even bound for the playoffs? Lmao okay. Y’all thought jimmy just wanted to hang and bang on the beach? THAT MAN IS A FATHER NOW AND HE’S READY TO SON THE LEAGUE. Y’all can keep James Hard-on and Russel Westdick, we got ballers that actually defense. When you go up against Miami, it’s going to be a fucking kerfuffle every game. Chris Silva will eat your children. Tyler Herro will bang your mom/daughter, whichever is more age appropriate. Nunn didn’t show up tonight but don’t think he isn’t bout that action either lmao. Culture big baby that’s what we’re about!"

I mean I think Lowery was a good signing for sure but I think the PJ Tucker signing is being pretty overrated. Their depth also concerns me a lot. The bench seems to be Tyler Herro and bunch of random guys
Can you post this the next time someone says we didn't get Harden because of Tyler Herro?  Harden was going to Brooklyn and that's it. No other team had real chances.
"So you can't attract free agents, but have an All-NBA player who wants to play for you, and your best move is to trade them for draft picks?  If you think whatever package the Heat/Lakers have been offering the past 2 years gives you a better chance than your All-NBA player, I don't know how else to proceed.  They should absolutely trade him if there's ever an AD/PG caliber offer, but the OP said they should have traded him 2 years ago... for what? Goran Dragic and Tyler Herro?"
Does anyone know why Tyler Herro is traveling with him?
"I'd actually like that but it's pretty much impossible. We'd have to trade Tyler Herro, PJ Tucker, and someone on a vet min to make the money work."
Yeah if he played like that all the time your team wouldn’t have moved on lol.   And in the 2020 playoffs a lot of your fanbase didn’t wanna trade Tyler Herro for James Harden.   A lot of shit changes in that time
"  This new talking point is silly because you really tried to put out there that Lowry doesn’t think he is worth the contract he got now because he asked for $25M/year for 2 seasons back in March.   Lowry asked for for a contract where his annual salary is near $30Ms over 3 years, and he ended up getting that contract. So how can Lowry possibly think he isn’t worth that much if he got the contract asked for that type of contract ahead of free agency? The contract literally meets all of his demands.   Lowry asking for an extra year alone compared to March, as well as going from asking for specifically $25Ms to the “neighbourhood of his starting annual salary”….like what are we doing here?   So using that as some sort of evidence for Miami paying Lowry significantly more than they actually had to is pathetic.   I never said he wasn’t raw.   Nunn was the PG to Butler/Bam the same way Bradley was the PG to Bron. At the end of the day Bam/Butler were *by far* the playmakers in that lineup and Nunn played off of them. They’ll put Tyler Herro in Nunn’s role since he has the same offensive capabilities/playstyle as Nunn while being like 5 years younger."
"Dion went on a rant on Twitter and to the media after a game “calling out” Pat Riley and Eric Spo.  Combine that with his inability to get into basketball shape that the Heat demanded at the time, the emergence of Tyler Herro and Kendrick Nunn on the squad, Dion was expendable and thus out of the rotation until he could get his act together. Post heat, Dion could not stay healthy and his conditioning was once again an issue with the Lakers. Idk if any team wants to take a chance on a guy who is a bonehead and hasn’t shown productive basketball in over 3 years"
"Heart and soul didn't seem to matter when Tyler Herro was taking a dump on the Celtics defense, nor did it matter last year or 2018/19 when we had the deepest team in recent Celtics history."
He's a rapper who made a song called Tyler Herro. The music video features Tyler Herro aswell.
He's a rapper who made a song called Tyler Herro. The music video features Tyler Herro aswell.
"Tyler Herro is three years younger than Donte, I'd bet people are (over)valuing youth &amp; potential."
You could say this without showing off your tyler herro hate lmfao.
"On the court, I can't think of anyone.  On the mic, Tyler Herro"
"Tyler Herro, Myers Leonard, Caruso, Joe Ingles, oh wait you mean play style…then I’d have to say Kyrie."
Jordan Poole &gt; Tyler Herro.
Rather have a player that’s really good at his role than the mystery box that is Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro is a middle class man's JJ Reddick
"People who think they shouldn't be compared are just salty.   I mean, you can just look at fantasy production in 9cat leagues. Donte was sneaky good this year, like top 75-60 I think? Tyler Herro was borderline droppable for most of the year.   I just can't think of too many teams that would benefit more having Tyler Herro than Donte. There's not a lot of guys that don't demand the ball, that defend well, spread the floor well enough, and can also pass good too. His game is so well rounded it's insane. Meanwhile, Herro is inconsistent as fuck."
"Not sure if this qualifies but Tyler Herro. In the bubble I was seeing shades of Devin Booker, and then when I saw him this year he just didn’t look the same, even if his stats show some progression."
Cam Thomas is essentially a better Tyler Herro
Tyler herro
I still think Tyler Herro has a Devin Booker potential. Just needs to get back on track and focusing on basketball.
Tyler herro
"Yes, I'm judging players who have been in the league 2/3 years on their most recent season - I don't think that's unreasonable. Julius Randle is a good 3-point shooter, even if he was not in the previous year.  I did point out that Herro actually takes more of his 3's from the corner, and the assist% for their shots aren't as large as you'd think (from 3 Donte's .779, Herro .729) - either way both are taking the majority of their 3's assisted.  &gt; Tyler herro shooting somewhat the same percentages, slightly higher even, but also shooting more than donte actually does show he’s more efficient.  'Higher' is doing work here when the difference between their TS% is static. And yes, Herro is better at creating his own shot (but by less than their reputations) and is taking three more shots on the same efficiency. But the difference there is neglibale when Donte, both on his year coming off the bench and starting, has a greater offensive impact because of his ability to get offensive rebounds *better than any other shooting guard in the league*. On defense the difference is even more extreme; for example Donte's DWS's for the 2019-20 season (where he was coming off the bench) matches Herro's combined offensive and defensive WS's for both years he's been in the league. There's absolutely no comparison on defense, and offensively by every metric that includes more than a players ability to create their own shots, Donte still has a greater positive impact."
Tyler Herro. Let the downvotes rain upon my body.   Dude dropped 37 on the Celtics in the ECF as a 20 y/o rookie. He’s had some injury problems but he has talent and he has the right mentality. Maybe a hot take but I think he’ll be a serious MVP candidate in a couple years.
"This past season was dontes only good season from 3 and the majority of them were catch and shoot corner threes. Your statistics you pulled support it. That’s what happens when you get 3 stars on a team.  It’s not the same as being able to create your own shot from 3. Creating your own shot isn’t something your advanced metrics can support. And it’s something you’re obviously avoiding. It’s an important skill to coaches.   Tyler herro shooting somewhat the same percentages, slightly higher even, but also shooting **more** than donte actually does show he’s more efficient. And I’m not just talking about from 3. There is a reason donte isn’t asked to do the things offensively that tyler is"
Tyler Herro
Ah yes. I used to love Tyler Johnson. But this Herro kid tickles my pickle a bit more.  Maybe it’s a Tyler thing.
"I should emphasize by saying he doesn’t score as much as he should, rather than he doesn’t score. He’s almost the same size as Embiid but infinitely more athletic but will pass the ball when he has, say, Tyler Herro guarding him. But aside from that and FT shooting he has very few flaws. He’s pretty much reverse Harden from a few years ago when any time he breathed people would be like “No DeFeNsE hurr durr”, they’re doing the exact inverse to Ben right now.   Not that he doesn’t deserve criticism but the acting like he’s not a star or good at basketball is just ridiculous lol."
"Tyler ""Bubble Boy"" Herro"
"Donte DiVincenzo is better than Tyler Herro. Absolutely every advanced metric confirms there's  a sizable gap in impact in Donte's favour, but I feel like people overvalue the difference of individual points per game."
"Tyler Herro, as much as he’s clowned I believe there is a future for him."
Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro
"Jimmy recovers his jump shot and shoots 38% from 3, Tyler Herro improves and wins 6th man of the year. Bam averages 22/10/6 and wins DPOY. Duncan Robinson improves into a good defender and shoots 45%+ from 3. Markieff Morris starts playing like his brother. Kyle Lowry and PJ Tucker turn back the clock.    We have the best defense in the league. We beat the Bucks and face the Nets in the conference finals. James Harden chokes against us like in 2012 because of our strip clubs, and we make it to the finals where we beat the Lakers who are not as good as people expect them to be.   The nets big three take the hardest road and all join the Heat in the off-season for assets and we have a dynasty on our hands."
It’s easily RJ Barrett. Left off the All Rookie team for Terence Davis. Left out of the top 125 in The Athletic. A lot of people I know still prefer Tyler Herro over him. He was our 2nd best player all year yet he’s sorta seen as a role player. I feel only Raptor fans appreciate the guy
"I agree.  I think there are more players drafted late first round who become solid role players who could put up 20+ on a bad team.  Kendrick Nunn, Tyler Herro types.  But also hard to say they'd be as good in any role without being drafted into a good culture, fit, coaching."
I'll fight that Donte DiVincenzo is better than Tyler Herro - OP should've put Donte up there so he can go last instead.
"In this case, if you’re Tyler Herro you’re last."
"I would probably say Murray at this point, although the first 4 are all close enough I think there are arguments for each. And then Tyler Herro is barely in the same area code of ability lol"
He shoulda put jalen brunson instead of Tyler herro
Tyler Herro does not belong on this list.
"""This league is full of theatrics and thespians. Several of you are worthy of Oscar-level performances for what you've done tonight. You should all be embarrassed — all of you, embarrassed.""     \- Robin Lopez to Tyler Herro, 2021"
"If there was espn play-by-play support, more us gambers would be watching.  I remember few seasons ago they had that. The season Tyler Herro/Bam were drafted."
This seems like something that could happen to Tyler Herro. He recently knocked up his gf who previously dated Kuz.
I think Tyler Herro is gonna have a big bounce back season
The same publications you talk about are the ones who ranked derozan as 82nd best player in nba last year below players like Tyler herro lmao they only care for clicks. They say the move is ass so bulls fans can click the articles and read it
New best friends Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro will be giving the speech for Miami Heat Player Kyle Lowry
Tyler herro but not Ant?
Bro I just think tyler herro is really overrated
"Reminder: Romeo is the (oft-injured) guy we drafted with the Kings pick that Philly included in the Tatum/Fultz pick swap.  Also, it was a SAC/MIA tiebreaker coin flip away from being Tyler Herro.  That was hard to stomach during the Bubble ECF."
Tyler Herro
"Imagine a Big 3 in Miami with Melo, Lebron, and Tyler herro 🤤"
Tyler Herro last season
Tyler Herro would be coo
Tyler Herro averaged 15ppg on 55 TS% in the playoffs. He literally averaged the same thing this year. Jimmy Butler locked TJ Warren's bum ass up when the playoffs started. Say you only watch highlights without saying you only watch highlights. Tyler Herro had one 37 point game and turned yalls brain into mush
"Tyler Herro is a star, I agree"
I too have heard of Tyler Herro
"Tyler Herro so I can actually figure out how good he is. I think he's gonna take a big leap this year. To quote my boy Zach Lowe, ""development isn't linear."""
Tyler Herro is Hardens father
Tyler Herro has more points in the finals than James Harden
"Bam is 24. His athletic prime is the next 4 years. And who are you stuck with the next 4 years? 36 year old Lowry and jimmy butler getting almost 50 mil a year. I don’t even have a reason to hate on the heat, it’s just a fact that this will hold them back. You cannot win a chip in this league with a big 3 of Lowry butler and bam. It’s not bad, but it will not win a chip. I’m not sure who’s signing with Miami 4 years from now after they will have failed to make it out of the East. Not to mention you have no promising young talent anywhere else on the roster. Tyler herro? Give me a break"
No more than Tyler Herro
How much help does Tyler Herro need??
Tyler Herro personally fought off five tracker jackers.
"I really don't get these Tyler Herro comments. Yeah he didn't look at all like the future star that Heat fans were hoping to see, but I don't really think he regressed at all from his rookie year."
Tyler Herro and a 2nd rounder. One young socialite for another
Tyler Herro production was killed last year so there's that
"Tyler Herro was killed in one of the Hunger Games and got replaced by an actor that looks like him, which explains his down year.   Similarly Jimmy and Bam lost their lives in the hunger games preceding the playoffs and were replaced by actors."
"&gt;one of the top NBA players  I bet you think Tyler Herro should have won Finals MVP too, huh"
Other young stars get it. Like Tyler Herro for example. White do those two have in common?
"They have Tyler herro dude, they know how to be dogs"
Every white suburban teen I knew hated Tyler Herro during the Heat run and made fun of his snarl
"Kinda interesting to think how those young Lakers teams would have developed together. 5 of those guys have all gotten large contracts.   D'Lo, Ball, BI, Randle, Kuzma, Larry Nance, Jordan Clarkson, Josh Hart is not the worst team build around and they could have landed PG or Kawhi in FA?   They probably pick somewhere around the late teens in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 drafts if they stick together? Could have added someone like Kevin Huerter, Thybulle, or Saddiq Bey. If they pick in that 12-14 range they could have gotten Michael Porter Jr, Tyler Herro, or Tyrese Hailburton in one of those drafts.   Surely not the championship contender they are with LeBron and you can't pay everyone but they could have fun to watch and root for I think."
"Tyler ""Game 6 Klay"" Herro"
I just don’t like the fact Miami’s 2 best players aren’t 3 point shooters. For that reason they will continue to be overrated   I said it last year and it may seem crazy but they need to unleash Tyler Herro. That’s the key. That gives them that dynamic ability bc that gritty and grind it out isn’t gonna cut it.
"It's still nebulous. First, there's ""gravity"" for every facet of facilitating offense, according to synergy data, so top 5 in ""gravity"" is non specific, and not true in aggregate for Robinson, second just based off glancing at how gravity is calculated it's pretty clear that it's contextual (as basketball index states as well), and simply having ""gravity"" in anyone one space means nothing more than teams are guarding you in that space. If you're team is filled with 5 great 3 pt shooters all on the court at the same time your gravity will be lower. If you'r sharing the backcourt with Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro, you're gravity will be greater. It's not the statistic you are claiming it to be. Duncan's gravity would drop significantly if he was sharing a backcourt with Cj and Dame, or Lowry and FVV."
"If I was ATL I would try to avoid Tyler Herro syndrome and sell high on the young guys who performed in the playoffs.  S&amp;T John Collins, Kevin huerter, reddish and picks for KAT or Siakam"
"I like Miami starting 5, but they aren’t deep at all. And I think Tyler Herro is closer to the guy we saw last year than who we saw in the bubble."
"I'd agree with this to an extent, Bam looked almost startled in that series this season, completely out of rhythm.    I think this upcoming year depends on a couple other factors as well.   1. How Spo uses Lowry offensively.   2. Bams development (as you stated)  3. Tyler Herro not being inefficient as fuck.   Also what the fuck happened to Jimbos stroke from three?  It's like it disappeared."
"That's a great comparison in some aspects. They have to be playing their best brand of basketball at the right time, get in rhythm.    I agree whoke heartedly, the shooters gotta be hot.   You'd also love to see Tyler Herro have a good junior season after his sophomore slump."
"So far,      PG            C               SF                PF                SG     Kyle Lowry    Bam Adebayo     Jimmy Butler      PJ Tucker         Duncan Robinson     Gabe Vincent  Dewayne Dedmon  KZ Okpala (??)    Markieff Morris   Tyler Herro                                                                       Max Strus  KZ might be going in the Dragic+Achiuwa trade in which case I'm curious who'd fit into that spot. Second unit is looking a bit directionless."
"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
Tyler Herro in shambles
The original Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro really was just a bubble boy…
"in theory this is possible. however, you'd burn bridges with every FO in the league for TYLER HERRO."
Maybe Brooklyn is still hurt. Maybe we're not as bad as we showed last year in the playoffs because of fatigue. Maybe Tyler Herro plays more free in his role of 6th man bucket getter not having to creat for others. Maybe Bam takes another leap. Anything can happen and it gives us a shot.
The Tyler Herro stans and the Bam stans will have a temporary moment of solitude to dump on Duncan whenever he starts a game 0-2 from 3. Should be fun.
Plz be Tyler Herro
"Tatum got outplayed by Tyler Herro, I'll gladly do a trade there."
Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro was able to get Jimmy Butler to team up with him before even playing a single game
Unless you have Ben Simmons or Tyler Herro
Are they finally giving up on Tyler Herro?
I used to think that Tyler Herro was better
Contrary: Tyler Herro never gets another big contract but like 2-3 vet mins before fading into obscurity.
Tyler Herro has a breakout season with a full off-season.
Tyler Herro probably LMAO
Tyler Herro hype has fallen a lot.
"They had a super team those last two championships and the bubble year doesn't count! What did they do this  year exactly? Last championship was in 2013. They have bam, butler, and now Kyle Lowry. They need another prolific scorer which would be tyler herro if his progression was where it should be. The dude is good but he could be a 20ppg scorer. His jumpshot is water and his confidence is mamba like. I just want him to do more"
Tyler Herro giving Blake Snell a run for his money the way he speak
So you're saying Tyler herro isn't ranked higher than him anymore? Shocker
And the Heat still have Jimmy + Bam playing huge minutes.   Also people like to group LeBron in with Russ and AD as if he’s a below average 3pt shooter. He shot close to 37% last season on 6 attempts per game which is surprisingly better than what Tyler Herro shot
"Duncan Robinson is 6'7"", 7'1"" wingspan, can shoot the lights out, can move his feet decently on defensive and can handle the ball okay for his size.    No one thinks he is more than 3rd or 4th scorer.  He does enough things well to stay on the floor. If he was just a lights out shooter he wouldn't be in the NBA.  perspective, Tyler Herro, is working to carve out a permanent role in the NBA, he doesn't turn it around, he wont get a second contract, or it wont be a long-term one. Everyone know Herro is better than Ronbinson, but there are 10 guys in the draft every year with Herro's skillset."
"Well obviously…but even jokingly it doesn’t make sense to say someone older is someone’s younger brother, you should have gone with like Tyler Herro and LaMelo Ball or something like that"
"Yes, I’m pretty sure the kid in the crowd wasn’t Tyler Herro either. Congratulations, you figured it out."
That kid? Tyler Herro.
I thought he meant Tyler Herro and a top 25 protected 1st
"&gt; Imagine the scandal if Luka Doncic or Tyler Herro went to FO after coach gets fired and said it is important that the head coach is white  You're right, it would be a scandal for Tyler Herro to think he has enough clout to participate in the coaching search. Riley would kill him.  Luka just chose Kidd, so your scenario fails there as well."
Imagine the scandal if Luka Doncic or Tyler Herro went to FO after coach gets fired and said it is important that the head coach is white
"Lakers flair so they'll probably say Bird is lower.  Even though Bird was pretty much the consensus better player through 1987, outside of LA, and that time period makes up the majority of both guys' respective careers.  Lakers had the better team for the decade, because Kareem &gt; Parish, Worthy &gt; McHale and Wilkes/Klay's Dad &gt; Celtics Walton. DJ &gt; Nixon/Scott, but not enough to outweigh everything else. Cooper vs Ainge is hard to compare - it's like Marcus Smart vs Tyler Herro."
"As if eye test ""Kyle Kuzma and Tyler Herro will be a perrenial all star"" is any better"
I have a good feeling about Tyler Herro possibly taking a leap this year. Especially after all the hate he got last season. I don't think he'll be that bubble star that he was but he'll be closer.
"Teams I got: Bucks, Lakers, Pacers, Heat, Thunder, Nuggets, Raptors.  PG: Malcolm Brogdon (4th) SG: Tyler Herro (5th) SF: Michael Porter jr (3rd) PF: Giannis (1st) C: Anthony Davis (2nd) 6th: Gary Trent Jr (6th) 7th: Poku (7th)  Hopefully I did this right, the decision between Lebron/Giannis/Jokic was tough but I ended up taking Giannis, I understand if you think the other two were better options."
Who the fuck is Tyler Herro
MJ's favorite player growing up was Tyler Herro. Wow.
And Jayson Tatum's favorite player growing up was Tyler Herro. Wow.
oi oi oi   don't disrespect the man tyler herro alright
The Miami heat already has Tyler Herro
"This is a joke, but I'm on this block. Standing reach is more what we care about than height, but we're so used to height that it would look weird to put reach as main attribute.  The whole advantage of ""height"" is how quick you are able to get your hand to a certain level. Tyler Herro is 6'4.5"" with a standing reach of 8'4.5"". Devin Booker is 6'4.5"" with a standing reach of 8'6.5"". Those two inches can be a big difference in getting off contested jumpers and finishing at the rim."
1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter 5. Darius Garland 6. Tyler Herro 7. Matisse Thybulle 8. Kevin Porter Jr. 9. Rui Hachimura 10. Keldon Johnson 11. PJ Washington 12. Luguentz Dort 13. Cameron Johnson 14. Brandon Clarke
It's kinda like a Tyler Herro situation I think.
"if u had to make a starting 5 of nba players with songs named after them specifically, what could u have  i have:  pg: tyler herro by jack harlow  sg: KOBE by Lil Uzi  sf:   pf:   center: mo bamba by sheck wes   can’t think of any for forwards"
"Ain't gon lie white NBA players used to be so much cooler, tyler herro aint got shit on this"
"Also, not really a specific trade offer, but so many Heat fans making Tyler Herro untouchable in a Harden trade was a bit absurd.  A classic one was during Channing Frye's rookie year. Knicks fan refused to include him in any Kevin Garnett trade offers."
Kendrick Nunn &gt; Tyler herro
"Also, if Miami had a chance to get harden and Tyler was the sticking point they are crazy. I would ship herro out in no time."
RJ Barrett &gt; Tyler Herro
One of the YT ads I get is a vax PSA that ends with Klay Thompson. So I'd say that counts. I think Tyler Herro was in it too.
I bet on Tyler Herro at +6000
Allonzo Trier and Tyler Herro are similarly talented players. One was properly developed and the other was not.
Tyler Herro?
Tyler Herro. For some reason?
Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro
Tyler “Ben Simmons” Herro.
That kid is Tyler Herro
I must be old. Who’s Tyler Herro?
For some reason reading the title I thought that it was going to be underwhelming... but nah shit made me LOL 🤣😂🤣 all over a Tyler Herro sighting wtf.
Who the fuck is Tyler herro
Imagine totaling your car for Tyler Herro
Lmaoooooooo he was clearly not Tyler herro
the nba landscape has officially passed me by. i remember watching the 2004 finals and that was like 17 years ago.   i'm not even gonna bother trying to wrap my head around why tyler herro is famous.
Who’s Tyler Herro?
Who tf is Tyler Herro?
Less than zero chance Tyler Herro has any idea who W.A.S.P. is
i think he means you wouldn't expect tyler herro to listen to wasp
over Tyler Herro?
This shit is wild to me man. I thought everyone was pretending to love Tyler Herro ironically or some shit. I don't think I would even recognize Tyler Herro if I saw him and definitely not with those *high in public* sunglasses.
Tbf he’s still right cuz the song was made since Tyler Herro and Jack Harlow are both white boys
It's Tyler Herro though 😂
For Tyler Herro?
Ignoring this fact is the biggest issue. Tip toeing around subjects like race and avoiding how race plays a factor in alot of things isnt doing anybody any favors. Nobody is actually colorblind and we have to stop pretending like we are. Im not saying everyone should be a proud racist but we should be able to acknowledge our biases.  And Luka is elite. Its not too far fetched to have him as a favorite. It gets weird when a middle of the road player like Tyler Herro gets hyped to the point where people are legitimately wanting him over James Harden. You’d never see something like that said about more promising young talent like Brandon Ingram or Devin Booker.
Who in the fuck is Tyler Herro?
For Tyler herro?
Bruh… it’s just fuckin Tyler Herro 😂
these people wildin' like tyler herro looks like Oubre or something wtf
Tyler Herro is not that good of a player to pull off that look or have that many people asking for his autograph.
Heat fan here.  My kid's ranking of all time greats is 1. D-Wade. 2. MJ and 3. Tyler Herro.
Tyler herro is not worth crashing your car into a wall
For Tyler Herro? You can find a Tyler Herro working at any gas station in America.
"Some straight men: Tyler Herro is an OK NBA player, but I wouldn't put him in the NBA's top ten players. I'd rather have Giannis on my team.  Some young, straight women: Tyler Herro is the best NBA player!"
Tyler Herro? Really? Not worth it at all
Who is Tyler Herro
"Bro yes that all applies into attractiveness and so does skin tone. I literally gave you an example of someone in the same age range as Tyler, went to the same college, is better looking (to me), and even is a better player who popped off at the same time. Yet this guy is nowhere near as popular with the zoomer girls as Tyler herro. Can he still pull? Yes lmfao. Will the general girl find him more attractive than Tyler, no LOL."
Sancho is probably the Tyler Herro of Man U and I bet similar things happen to him.
What is a Tyler Herro? Is it like a sloppy gyro?
"This is understandable if it was like say Alex Caruso, but Tyler Herro? Not worth your car"
"Marlow is a huge Kentucky stan, Tyler Herro went to Kentucky"
Imagine getting excited over Tyler Herro lmao
It is and his play making is excellent as well. Philly really needs him to be able to shoot though. Herro has a solid all around game with work needed on his defense and consistency.   The difference to me is confidence. Ben lacks that and that isn't something that is easily fixed. Tyler is on the other end of that spectrum also to the detriment of the team at times. It's easier to coach someone into not being so overconfident cuz you can just bench them. They'll still have confidence but know if they don't do the right things they get benched. How do you fix lack of confidence on this stage though?
"The thing is I’m not and I’m surprised you see it as that lol. I’m a minority and lived in really Mexican and Asian cities for big portions of my life and always had a diverse group of friends even in college. White dudes being the most attractive to my female friends is really common to the point I’m shocked people think I’m forcing a race narrative right now. When all you see growing up is attractive white dudes in super hero capes, you’re gonna find them attractive.   To bring it back to the nba, Jamal Murray is objectively a better player, popped off in the bubble, and subjectively hotter than Tyler herro. He’s also not a zoomer celeb. It’s not a woke narrative it’s just facts and maybe you grew up in a different environment where it wasn’t obvious to you."
Honest question from someone that doesn't get the whole see a celebrity and have them sign a piece of paper thing. Do people actually pay for that? How much would a Tyler Herro autograph go for?
"This comment section is weird as hell, I mean I don't care about the guy either but a lot people are very salty over like 20 people grabbin a autograph/meet with Tyler Herro. Like they seem pretty excited to meet him, let them live their lives lol"
"Bruh, I never moved the goalpost. All I'm talking about is Tyler is a scorer, not just a 3pt shooter.   My main point is Tyler is an overall scorer just like the other guy above pointed out. Even his career stats are 12.2(FGA)/5.3(3PA) which, like the playoff stat, is close to call, doesnt tell the full story in playstyle.  But will agree with you, if you crash your car meeting a famous person, at least have it someone more popular than Tyler Herro lmao."
"For Tyler herro tho,lmaoo"
"Lmao dude I watch regular season and post season equally, so stop moving the goal post. I know who Tyler Herro is as a player and nothing you’re saying dismisses any of my arguments. You’re just stating that I don’t watch games and I’m wrong without countering any of my points with facts.   Herro is a high highs low lows player, but he is fundamentally a 3 point shooter who shot 31% from 3 when it counted most. He might be a volume shooter, but he’s a volume 3 point shooter and shot 31% from 3 on 4.5 attempts per game and 9.8 total FGA per game in the playoffs last year. My main point is that someone damaged their car over this guy and that, to me, is pretty hilarious. I’d still do the same shit as that girl probably because most NBA players are worth meeting in my eyes but I would also lol very hard at myself for damaging my car over rushing to meet Tyler Herro."
Wow with sunglasses on Tyler Herro looks a ton like Aaron Gordon.
For **Tyler Herro?**
Tyler Herro looks like such a douche lmao  Dressed like he’d be running a YouTube prank channel if he wasn’t in the NBA
bet you $10K more people in FL know who Alan Kulwicki is than Tyler Herro.
You must live in a basement. I have friends who are chicks who do like white men and find guys like Tyler herro attractive. If Tyler herro was any other race I assure you he wouldn’t be a zoomer nba celebrity. It’s not hard to figure out society finds white dudes the most attractive because of societal norms.
"Tyler ""White Anglo-Saxon Protestant"" Herro"
"American celebrity worship really is fucking weird. I mean, it'd be one thing if it was a transcendent talent like Steph Curry or something. That I'd kinda get. But Tyler Herro? Lmao. Is it cause he had a crappy hip hop song written about him by a mediocre rapper?"
Is Tyler Herro at a level where he needs security? I assumed its a friend could be a security guard though.
You didn't know who Tyler Herro was? Do you follow basketball?
"Tyler Herro: ""damn that's crazy. Good luck tho"""
"Lol, all for.... Tyler Herro?"
"Wait, how? You mean, like, Miami college kids? Why would anyone who doesnt follow NBA know Tyler Herro?   Hell, I don't think I could even pick him out of a crowd of similar people."
Well I said something about the genesis of the song so someone did...it was me.  I agree Mo Bamba does have a song. It was made by a guy who was his friend before either of them were famous. It's pretty different than how Tyler Herro got his song.
She deserved Tyler Herro to come and give her an autograph straight to her car lol
"‘ your car can only get you from a to b, talking to Herro you’ll get from here to there , invaluable. Heck id crash 1 car to speak to Tyler and another car to say thank you ‘  - twitter hustle culture"
Ben Simmons is definitely better than Tyler Herro lol c'mon now
Al this for Tyler fucking Herro? This is sad.
I think Tyler Herro should be in that discussion.
Tyler Herro and Bamonte Adebyao recruit Luka to form Heatles 2.0
All these people waiting are cowards. Tyler Herro or bust babyyyy.
tyler herro; great player but his fan base seems annoying sometimes
"It's crazy that you think the things missing from the bubble (crowds, travel, etc.) aren't a part of NBA basketball. The reason people give an asterisk to the bubble is because it doesn't accurately represent what playoff basketball is all about. I really doubt guys like Tyler Herro or AD would have had the run that they did if 20 000+ fans were screaming at them."
"I’ll never forget how much of an anomaly the bubble playoffs were. We had TJ Warren playing like Kobe, Tyler Herro and Duncan Ferguson becoming Steph and Klay, and AD inheriting MJ’s midrange game. That was a crazy time lmao"
the heat fans have ruined tyler herro
I got him. Cam Reddish. Nd Tyler Herro as 6moty rn
"For the haters out there Tyler Herro had a better +/- than AD and outscored all of Lebron, Melo, and Wayne Ellington (two olympians and an NCAA champion) by 14 in only 27 minutes of play"
Tyler Herro was a rookie when he was overhyped. He's still improving. I expect
"Ariza is declining, probably around Bazemore level  Nunn isnt a good defender unless you compare him to like Tyler Herro or Dame.  THT is barely above average."
That's a nice pic of Tyler Herro
AD is the single most overrated player in the NBA today. Used to be Tyler Herro but at least he’s improving.
"Tyler Herro, rebound creator. Was at the arena, so mad at him every play just driving into three guys, doing a spin, and shooting"
He's no Tyler herro though...
One of them is a champion and was the second best player in the series.  The other bricked his team out of the Playoffs against LeBron James and got embarrassed by Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson.
Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro is more eager to shoot than KD and Harden combined lol  Every time he gets the ball it's a shot
Unless you’re Tyler herro. Then you get two calls for slipping.
What do you mean? Tyler Herro is clearly top 1 in the league.
Not that I agree but I think that was more because Tyler Herro was a rookie
"From the interview   “**One player comes to mind as you bring up all of these ideologies and sports science methods the Heat have used the last few seasons: Tyler Herro. Massive talent, but doesn’t always crack the rotation. How do you bring him along with your brand of tough love?**  Oh man, he’s a tough kid. He’s tougher than a lot of people think. He wants the tough love, actually.  **Really?**  I tiptoed around it a few times, but he said, “Nah, OG. I ain’t soft.” He wants it. I give him that. I wasn’t sure about him. I saw him play in college. He’s not soft at all. Just needed to get stronger. He has the will, has the passion, has the right mindset. He just wasn’t physically there yet. People forget he was 19 years old. And regardless of how well he played offensively, he was still only 19. A lot of people took advantage of that, and, rightfully so...a lot of people took it upon themselves to put [Herro] in a lot of actions and beat him up out there. But offensively? I’ve never seen a kid be able to do what he was able to do at 19 or 20 years old. But, hell yeah: he can take it. He definitely can take it. He part of the Dog Pound now. OG love you to death. But I will be brutally honest wit’ yo’ ass, boy.  **He said recently that he deserves to be in the same conversation as Luka Doncic and Trae Young and the other young stars of the NBA. Is that what you’ve seen?**  Facts. He just hasn’t been given the keys. He came to a team that’s been successful and didn’t need a superstar right away...he came into a different situation. But skillswise, talent wise, damn right. Them other boys ain’t been to the Finals yet, and that’s not to knock them, but you see what [Herro] did. Boy got game. Straight up and down. And if he was on a team, probably not a good team, and he got to go out there and do his thing? Damn right he’d be in those conversations.”"
"Quoting u/ozymandias12    Some great nuggets in this GQ Profile of OG:  He wants to play 20 seasons:  What do I get outta this? 20 years. If I can get 20 years it’ll be an amazing career for a kid that no one thought would play in the league. All my sacrifices, everything I’ve given, the only thing I’ve asked for is to try to get to 20. I wanna give that to myself, and I wanted to give it to my father.  Haslem thinks Tyler deserves to be in the Luka and Trae conversation:  Facts. He just hasn’t been given the keys. He came to a team that’s been successful and didn’t need a superstar right away...he came into a different situation. But skillswise, talent wise, damn right. Them other boys ain’t been to the Finals yet, and that’s not to knock them, but you see what [Herro] did. Boy got game. Straight up and down. And if he was on a team, probably not a good team, and he got to go out there and do his thing? Damn right he’d be in those conversations.  Haslem almost left Miami because they didn't want to pay him:  Shit, I was almost outta here — they ain’t have no money left. I was about gone. They wasn’t saving enough for me. They just wanted the big boys. They wasn’t thinking about me, the only one who was was [Wade]. He understood my importance to this city and franchise and thank God he did because it paid off.  Haslem explains why the Bubble wasn't a fluke and how the team approached the situation:  I only stayed in my room or played cards with Jimmy [Butler]. Even LeBron, as much as I love Bron, I didn’t hang out with Bron one time in the bubble. My guys need to understand what we’re here for. They’re young: they don’t need to see me kickin’ it with Bron, playing cards with Bron. We here for a reason. I want to beat Bron. I don’t need you confused! They don’t understand how I can kick it with somebody and wanna rip they head off.  I ain’t leave my room. I ain’t fraternize with nobody. And for three, four months, it was just about that. What pisses me off, man, is that people discredit what [the Heat] did in the bubble because we didn’t have a great season the very next season. Don’t get mad at me because your favorite team and favorite player was a mental midget in the bubble. Trying to fry chicken and have pool parties and shit, we ain’t here for that. Ain’t our fault motherfuckers was soft!...why discredit us? The Lakers ain’t make the playoffs the next season either and ain’t nobody sayin’ shit about them!...that takes nothing away from what we did the year before. Doesn’t change that Milwaukee swept us last year, we still beat they ass two years ago! It’s still in the record books! They whipped our ass and we whipped their ass."
Tyler Herro and Porzingis immediately come to mind
Yeah fucking Tyler Herro got more hype than him when Nuggets and Heat made finals in their conferences
Luka   AD  Tyler Herro
"Can't believe the writer resisted ""As Tyler finds the Herro inside"""
This fixation on Tyler herro is too much. I’ll check him out in 2 years
Tyler Herro is the most overrated player on the planet
Tyler Herro should have made it to the best under 25 list of Bleacher Report
Tyler Herro belongs in same conversation as Trae and Luka. Bring the smoke 😤😬
I wonder what song Tyler Herro would use.

&gt;Pat is shooting 41% from deep this year  I don’t wanna hear that. Tyler Herro is averaging 23 points right now but I don’t expect that to hold up. Why? Because it’s a 4 game sample size lmao. Just dumb to bring it up.   And I disagree with the career year part completely. I think his usage will fall off significantly when everyone’s healthy again
*Tyler Herro has entered the chat*
"Duncan Robinson, Alex Caruso, Red Velvet, Tyler Herro, Luka, Dragic, Dario Saric"
"Nah, he's 38th   for reference  Isaac Okoro: 36th in 2019  Tyler Herro: 37th in 2018  Nickeil Alexander-Walker: 40th in 2017  -----------------  Basically if he develops physically a little bit, he's a fine NBA prospect. He's only about 6'2"" right now though."
"I say this without exaggeration, but based on these last few games, Harden may be the worst athlete in American history. People like Tyler Herro, Lance Stephenson, and Zaire Wade have much better legacies than Harden."
Tyler Herro tho
He’s 38th in his class. For reference Tyler Herro was 37th.
"Tyler ""Black Kuzma"" Herro ready for the smoke this season."
"I think he’ll be a 6moy candidate this year and finish in top 3, but I don’t think he’ll win it if Tyler Herro keeps playing like he has"
"Not even that though, that would be Tyler Herro by a lot"
6MOY Tyler Jerome Herro
Mmmm Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro will win MIP and 6MOY.
"My takes are looking great and bold takes are takes that you don't fully believe in them, but you believe them like 20%-30%  I said Tyler Herro might win MIP or 6th man.  I said Lakers ain't gonna be a top 3 seed  I said Warriors winning the title"
"Miles Bridges is in that Luka, Trae, Tyler Herro tier"
"I know he's not really all that great of a player, but when Reggie Jackson is playing nice he looks very smooth. Last years playoffs is a great example. Also I think Tyler Herro is smooth with it as well."

So Tyler Herro had 30 points only making 3 threes and 10 rebounds but was -15?
"Of course it does, but if you're looking at it with full context, he was playing well the whole 4 quarters and could clearly tell he was gassed from carrying the offensive load.  This conversation stemmed from the implication that Tyler Herro didn't play/shoot well.  Also, it's clear you're just hating so I should also just follow the advice I gave the other dude. Have a good one."
"Duarte has a solid 90 mph fastball with great movement, and is a top 5 Cy Young candidate. Tyler Herro is batting .302 with 31 homers and 40 stolen bases. Trae and Luka are utility guys getting minor league contracts, with a few call ups a year: and you don't think this is some joke?!"
Tyler Herro being the only bright spot in an otherwise terrible game for the heat
Tyler Herro being the pretty much only bright spot in an otherwise terrible game for the heat
Watch it. I love Tyler Herro.
"Which one is the guy that kept saying shit like ""brick"" when Miami would shoot or ""target Tyler herro everytime""? That's who I'm talking about. The guy actually calling the action was tolerable."
I got all the receipts on this sub re: Tyler Herro. Y’all are fucked
"I honestly think if they continue to put in the work and show out this season, it's not unreasonable to put Luka and Trae in the same conversation as Tyler Herro"
lol why has tyler herro taken 27 shots
Tyler Herro ftw
Tyler Herro is our hero
Tyler Herro is a bad bad man
Uh.. I might have to delete some Tyler Herro Tweets from the past year.
Tyler Herro is going to have one of the easiest sixth man of the year campaigns of all time. His offensive game is just awesome now. Should probably be Most Improved Player too.
"I’ve seen enough, Tyler Herro for 6MOTY"
Tyler Herro dilema continues
TYLER HERRO WHAT IS HAPPENING
is tyler herro the best player on the heat?
Tyler Herro is black.
Tyler Herro is ready to take the next step
Tyler Herro coming for y’all people who disrespected the shit outta him last year and i’m here for it. 💪🏾
Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro is scoring a cool 24 points tonight. 6MOY campaign continues!
Tyler Herro is as good as advertised
I think Tyler Herro is gonna go off again tonight. Who will stop him?
"Oh I agree it will be heavily bench dependent and second unit is definitely really streaky. If Herro can lead the bench unit like he did when the starters are out we will be golden. Which is why i we are going to be experimenting with our rotations alot this season. Until Dipo gets back I expect to see lineups of Kyle or Jimmy+Tyler with the bench unit.   Also i do want to make one thing clear...my reaction to the game has more to do with our performance both on offense and defense than anything else. However i will say...that us Keeping Middleton and Giannis in check is a good sign. They both had great offensive performances in the playoffs and most teams couldn’t handle them. We didn’t get to see how we could slow down Jrue or handle Lopez though.   But honestly the thing that impresses me the most was the effort from our guys. One of the biggest weaknesses teams have is letting their foot off the gas peddle and it’s so easy to do that when you think you are winning. However...we gave you guys the ultimate form of respect. Guys like Giannis,KD and Lebron do not give up easily and will play until the Buzzer if they have to.   It actually happened to the Sixers last night...they had a good lead but Harden and KD didn’t give up and came back and won.  Any playoff level team and any elite players will do that. More importantly though...while I’m happy with the performance I’m not going to get cocky. We play 3 more times this season and you could blow us out next time if you come out full force and we start slow.   I honestly view every playoff level team  like the Spurs vs Heat finals in 2013...which Bud helped coach.  It was a seesaw.  Game 1-Spurs come in off the road and beat us in a close game.  Game 2-We blowout the Spurs to even the series.  Game 3-Spurs blow us out at home. Go up 2-1  Game 4-heat blow out Spurs on the road. 2-2  Game 5- Spurs blow out the Heat at home go up 3-2  Game 6-Spurs have a 4th quarter lead and are winning by like 4 points and we have seveal turnovers.  We recover in the last 28 seconds,force an OT and win by 3. 3-3  Game 7- neither team had won Twice in a row yet. But it’s basically close all game. Heat eventually win etc.   Then we have 2014...Spurs are out for revenge and spank us in the finals.   Point is...i take rivalries like these seriously."
"As a guy that refuses to give credit to guys way better than Tyler Herro, this comes off as either a joke or just dumb."
In the same way that Tyler herro is the modern version of Larry bird.
Tyler Herro
"Definitely is a troll account. They're known by most Celtic fans on this sub.   They get karma by shitting on Boston for easy upvotes and because they're always very quick to celebrate the Toronto Raptors as the best run franchise in the East there's always a steady flow of upvotes by gullible Toronto fans.  There was a point where they were arguing Jaylen Brown was one of the worst players in the NBA.  &gt;* Would trade Jaylen Brown for him. Powell is incredible.  &gt;* Norman Powell deserved All-Star selection over Jaylen Brown. The Raptors are incredible at developing players, arguably the best in the league.  &gt;* I'd trade Jaylen Brown and a decade's worth of first round picks and swaps for [Ayton]. He'd be an amazing fit next to Tatum instead of a black hole.  &gt;* Helps that Jaylen Brown was a traffic cone on defense.  &gt;* Green teamers have been working overtime trashing Tatum and Brown's supporting cast because no one wants to admit that Tatum and Brown (especially Brown) are just not that good.  &gt;* Would rather have Powell than Jaylen Brown.  &gt;* Brown is one of the worst defenders in the NBA right now because he doesn't know how to play off-ball defense. Tatum is still far and away the better player.  &gt;* Jaylen Brown for Norman Powell, God please!  &gt;* Boston lost to Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson because Spoelstra is so much better than Brad Stevens and Jaylen Brown was and still is the worst defender in the NBA. Credit to the Heat but Tatum deserved better from his team, we shouldn't have lost that series.  &gt;* Harden will make Ainge pay for not trading Jaylen Brown for him. The greatest offensive player in the history of the league was literally available and Ainge refused to trade him for Jaylen Brown, the most overrated player in the NBA.  &gt;* Brown did not deserve his All-Star selection. His defense is massively overrated considering how often he lets players cut around him, and his offense has been slumping for a month.  &gt;* [Randle's] better than Tatum and Brown combined. I'm insanely jealous of New York's future, especially considering RJ is already way better than Brown.  &gt;* The biggest problem is that Tatum and Brown are simply not good enough, especially Brown.  &gt;* Tatum, Brown, and Brad Stevens are embarrassments to the Celtics franchise.    Are you starting to see a theme here?  Because I could go on..."
"I've been hearing about ""two great young stars"" for four straight years now and they have done nothing since 2018. Can't even beat Tyler Herro in the Playoffs."
"What does this have to do with Jordan Poole, Scottie Barnes, and Tyler Herro?"
yeah tyler herro is cool because he's like a middle school bully
Tyler Herro definitely thinks he's more black than Trae
He put in 12 names that weren't Tyler Herro? Smh.
"Tyler deserves pre and post shower head Tyler deserves to be rubbed every night before bed Tyler deserves to have no scawy thoughts in his head Tyler deserves to be treated like a man even as a kid Tyler deserves to get all the pre game interviews, even for games he’s not in Tyler deserves better from me, you, his team and his fellow humans Tyler deserves to meet his childhood hero’s Only for them to point out who is in fact The true Herro. Tyler Herro. The biggest balls and coolest hair. Tyler Herro. Miami Heat Extraordinaire."
who tf is comparing luka/trae to tyler herro? thats like comparing apples to a fruit no one's ever heard of
"&gt;Herro provided that remark to Jeremy Tache of Bally Sports Florida, who    asked him about his career projections and what his goals were    long-term.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;""I feel like I'm in the same conversion as those guys. The young guys    coming up in the league who can be All-Stars, superstars one day—Luka,    Trae, Ja—those guys like that, I feel like my name should be in that    category, too.  What do you want him to say here?  /r/nba has a bitter jealousy of Tyler Herro it is really strange. If Jimmy Butler said he was in the conversation of players that are better than him, everyone would be happily conversing on how you want a player with that dawg in him and that hustler mentality. But no, because it is Tyler Herro, he is delusional? Newsflash, nothing he said is wrong. Tyler Herro could be an All-Star one day. It is not outside the realm of possibility, especially if he plays like he did last night."
"Herro? You mean Chuck? He’s often delusional. The reason you can’t really compare them is that Luka and Trey are number 1 options, while Tyler is not. The thing is, being a number 1 option doesn’t make you better, that’s just your style of game. Luka wouldn’t play well or be optimized if he is not the best player on his team, and Herro wouldn’t be optimized if he was the best player on his team. If the question is: which one of these players is more likely to contribute to a championship win, Luka or Trey as a 1st option or Herro as a 3rd option, it’s probably Herro. I don’t think you can win a championship with Luka or Trey as your best player, and Herro is the exact type of player you can’t get enough of as a 2nd or 3rd option on a championship team. Basketball is not just about skill and simply putting the most talent out there on the court, each player has to fit into their role and work together as a team. Luka would be pretty trash on a team with LeBron where he’s not the 1st option nor is he the point."
"If you watch Heat basketball, Tyler has it too. The only difference between the three is that Herro is not the focal point of the offense and is often in with the second unit. And his cockiness. I feel like he's embraced his current role and changed his cockiness to confidence. His confidence is absolutely warranted, though. Based on his ability to create shots for himself."
ok is it just me or has tyler herro grown like a foot since that bubble season? he looks way taller
"Jimmy Butler called Tyler Herro to his room for a ""tense"" discussion"

"There was a prop bet that was +6600 that Tyler Herro would have 20, 6, and 6 and he finished with 27, 6, and 5 so that’s fun. Too bad the Bucks couldn’t even be competitive."
"&gt;and having Larry who is a smart defender but I struggle to see him adjusting to the pace of this NBA compared to the older pace where he could defend.  Good defense has more to do with effort than foot speed or athleticism. It helps to be fast and jump high, but Joe Ingles is a better defender than say Kyrie Irving. Kyle Anderson is a better defender than Tyler Herro. LeBron can take the faster player of the 3/4 position if it's a concern"
Tyler Herro has a legit case for all-star as well as MIP. 22/6/4 off the bench shooting 40% from 3 and being top 5 in 4th quarter scoring
Gary Trent jr Jordan Poole Tyler herro Bobby portis
Tyler Herro 6MOY and MIP.
"Who in this case beating Bulls or Heat?   If we're still just on the Bulls I actually don't buy the Heat. Even with Tyler Herro having made something of a massive leap (or maybe he's just started really hot? We shall see). I just dont think they can defend the Bucks. They're still tiny. I realize everyone loves Bam but he is just not in the same universe as guys like Giannis and Jokic and when he has to deal with those guys (and Brook Lopez in the Bucks case), it's just too much. The Heat are clearly better than last year,  but I don't think they're in the same class as the Bucks/Nets. I think Chicago could have a good shot against them as well. With homecourt I'd probably even lean toward Chicago."
Butler is probably considered a forward now.  He plays next to guards like Lowry and Duncan and then Tyler Herro is the 3rd guard.
"My personal picks:  3-POINT SHOOTOUT: Jonas Valanciunas, Stephen Curry, Seth Curry, Lonzo Ball, Carmelo Anthony, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Darius Garland, Christian Wood  DUNK CONTEST: Daniel Gafford, Anfernee Simons, Anthony Edwards, Javonte Green  SKILLS CHALLENGE: Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Kuzma, Evan Mobley, Tyler Herro, Kevin Porter Jr."
"If that's how they play without him, give Tyler Herro the mvp right now"
"So what if he has that kind of usg on a team with bron and ad? Tyler herro has the highest usg on a team with butler and adebayo, of course he will have the ball in his hand a lot, he's an elite point guard, of course he will have that kind of usg%, you're the dumb fuck who is not accepting the reality of how good Russ is, you're just a blind hater"
"6th man of the year: Tyler ""hood tendencies"" Herro   Near unanimous or nah?"
this is r/nba you’re not allowed to say ur team is good. you have to suck off other players and say your players aren’t good enough. Tyler Herro is averaging 22/5/4 off the bench lmao he should certainly be in the mix for the ASG this year
Tyler Herro is not making an all-star game coming off the bench
Bulls really lost to a team missing Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro
Tyler herro who? Gabe Vincent is my new best friend
Gabe “Duncan Robinson” “Tyler Herro”” Vincent
Bubble boy. Everyone apologize to Tyler herro
"I’m a heat fan and gave up on that completely. He got the skills and talent but he ain’t got that edge in him. And he probably will never get it (which means he’s not a max player but whatever it’s fine). At least, it seems, that when our old vets age out well have Tyler WHO DEFINITELY GOT THAT EDGE. He can take over and bam we’ll make for a damn good number 2. Hopefully herro keeps improving in these next few years under Lowry and jimmy that way he’s fully formed by the time they gotta go"
"Like the other dude said, every team faced those challenges. It’s obviously different, but it was different for every team in the bubble. The lakers were the best team during that time, and they won the championship, just like every other team who has won. Because the lakers are playing poorly now doesn’t mean the 2020 run was fraudulent, the lakers were just a better team back then.   It’s similar to all the shit Tyler Herro got last year. Everyone was saying he was a bubble boy and peaked in the bubble due to the unique circumstances, and then this year he’s fucking balling out and looks better than he did in the bubble. Players and teams get better and worse every season."
"Missing out on Tyler Herro by one pick and not going after CP3 really hurts man, though tbf no one expected Kemba’s decline to have been that steep."
"Do you want to make another Tyler Herro, this is how you do it."
"I have no idea TBH, it all depends on what the morale of the Jays is, can't imagine it's that high.   I don't really want to blow the team up because I still like all the guys and we'd suck for a long time, who the fuck knows when we'd find somebody as good as Tatum, but that's probably the right thing to do because this team is locked into a 2nd round ceiling as it currently stands and the East is as deep as its ever been.   Way I see it is Tatum is looking a lot like the next PG, a great player, and somebody who is a perfectly fine #1 option if you want to make the second round/Conference Finals, but if you want to win a championship, he's probably a 1B alongside another great offensive player. Jaylen is a lot like Klay, great shooter, great man defender, but his impact on the game can sometimes come and go.   More than anything, the one thing I'm sick of with this franchise is it has no damn luck anymore. Nothing ever goes our way. We lose the coin flip with the Heat where they pick Tyler Herro who then beats us in the Bubble. We *always* have the most untimely injuries, Rob is our 3rd best player and the dude is always hurt and when he's not hurt, is missing games for other things like illness. Jaylen has had a recurring hamstring issue for awhile now. Smart plays with reckless abandon (and I love him for that) and so is liable to miss at least 10-15 games/season. You compound those injuries with the shitty depth that Ainge left us and you have a team that is pretty good when fully healthy but is never fully healthy.   You have no idea how much I wanted Canada's ass in Boston. C'est la vie."
Duncan Robinson this year and Tyler Herro last year
Tyler Herro will be an All-Star
I know it’s early. But I just watched Cade for 3 games in a row look very average. Meanwhile Herro has 31 vs his team and completely took over the game.   Cade has good potential but Tyler is much safer of a bet at this point
"Like I said, you’ll see when he outplays Tyler Herro."
"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pujyhv/_/he4jnhx  I'll admit none were super hot takes in the first place but I think they were unpopular enough  &gt; Lakers lose in the 1st round  Remains to be seen but they seem to be headed for a low playoff seed  &gt; Raptors are a top 6 seed  Probably pretty unlikely now  &gt; a Blazer wins 6MOY (either Little or Nance)  Stupid Tyler Herro ruined this, but both Little and Nance have been excellent  &gt; Blazers have 2 all-stars  Lol CJ sucks  &gt; Nurk makes an all-Defense team  This could happen. He's been #2 on the defensive RAPTOR all year  &gt; GTJ is the 2nd leading scorer on the Raptors  He's 4th right now, but they're all close, and I think GTJ's role is only gonna get bigger and bigger as the season goes on  &gt; Pelicans are a bottom 3 seed in the West  They are indeed  &gt; Celtics are a play-in team (7-9 seed) but make playoffs  Seem to be headed that way for sure"

Tyler Herro 20+ ppg
"That Tyler Herro would have a great season. So many people turned on him and shit on him last year, which was crazy. He has a great rookie season, and had like what?, a month of an “off season” cuz they were just in the finals. Rookie year to 2nd year is always a big transition, and the guy had zero offseason to rest the body or improve much. Then he got his instagram model girlfriend pregnant, and obviously at 19/20 years of age, that’ll be on the mind a lot about becoming a new dad. Throw in some small injuries that keep you hindered throughout, trade rumors, the internet shitting on you, AND even half your fanbase turning on you… that’s a lot for a kid to handle. Dude got an off-season to actually work, and now he’s balling out. I felt like it was gonna be an obvious turn around year for him, but so many people kept shitting on him over the off season"
This is why I hate the 6MOTY award going to guys like Tyler Herro. Being a starter doesn’t mean anything if you play backup minutes and the flip side is true.  Being a backup doesn’t mean anything you play starter minutes.
"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14. De'Aaron Fox   Honourable mentions (not ranked in order): Deandre Ayton, Michael Porter Jr., Tyler Herro, Scottie Barnes, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, Miles Bridges, John Collins, Gary Trent Jr., Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, RJ Barrett, Tyrese Haliburton  It'll be fun to look back on this thread in 5 years"
Tyler Herro.

"Wait, Tyler Herro can’t swim either? That feels like borderline child neglect when growing up in Wisconsin."
"Oh wow yall have five more wins than a team that's even younger than I am, so impressive 👏🏾 I also wouldn't call 16/8/5 on 5-9 shooting getting owned, Tyler Herro being 5-18 and 4-11 from three is definitely getting owned though lol I hate watching that man play"
What he did to tyler herro had me falling out of my chair. He just waltzed over to him and snatched the ball at a really important time  Does anyone have a replay of that?
Better than Tyler Herro
"That little Tyler herro snarl he did, looking back at the packers. That’s what I’m talking about, not his play on the court buddy"
"s/o to when I was downvoted for saying Lowry wouldn't be a 17 &amp; 7 player this year.   &gt;he averaged 17 &amp; 7 for a 27 win team. He will be turning 36 years old this season and all of his advanced stats painted him as a pretty average player last season. He's not washed in the sense that he's useless, but folks expecting him to be an all star caliber guy are in for a surprise. I think he probably averages \~11 &amp; 6 this year.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;I just don't see him getting the minutes. He averaged 17 ppg in 34 mpg last year. He will be turning 36 years old and competing for minutes with Tyler Herro, Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo and then a slew of rotation guards.   Last year Butler played 34 mpg, Oladipo was at 28 mpg (recovering from injury so possibly expect an increase in mpg this year), Herro averaged around 31 mpg, and Vincent and Strus were around 13 mpg each in bench roles. Assuming he fills the Goran Dragic role (26 mpg) I'd be shocked if he averaged 15+ ppg. Even if he got more mpg, Miami has a lot of scoring options, I just don't see Lowry needing to score all that much.   Last year only 2 players averaged 15+ ppg at age 35+, they were LeBron James and Chris Paul. Lowry is great but he's obviously a tier or two below LeBron and Paul. Paul played 32 mpg last year and was also an All Star and All NBA 2nd team the past two years. Lowry as good as he is, is still a ways behind Chris Paul.  Folks were saying I was a hater for suggesting he'd average &lt; 15 ppg lmao"
"Fair to chalk it off to shit luck with injuries. Making the conference finals when we weren't ever favourites to win the finals isn't terrible.  I could recount how if Tyler herro &amp; Iggy didn't play so well in game 6, maybe we would've made the finals or maybe if Jeff green missed for Cleveland but that's unproductive. They deserved it. Good for them.  Especially considering that of all of Hayward, Kyrie, Kemba, Morris &amp; Fournier, the only two to ever give us quality minutes in the playoffs were Morris &amp; Fournier. (I say quality minutes because kyrie was fit in 2019 &amp; so was Hayward barely and they, Kyrie especially, so shit against Milwaukee in the 2nd round 4-1 exit)."

Tyler Herro is a typical Chad
Tyler Herro
I 100% believe this based on only knowing what Tyler Herro looks like
Tyler Herro is annoying and Jack Harlow is overrated
"I went to highschool with Tyler Herro (I was a senior when he was a freshman)  He was friends with one of my friends who was a junior, and I'm dead ass serious that Tyler was such a fuckboi around my girlfriend lol. Always trying to be like extra funny around her and asking her weird questions. Actually, he was just kinda like that around every girl, shit got awkward sometimes.  Everytime I see or hear him, I see 14yo tyler in my head and how annoying he was, so just for that I wouldn't mind if he never wins a chip lol"
Tyler Herro will always be a bitch for swapping from Wisconsin to a blue blood
"Not a superstar though. People think tyler herro's ceiling is Victor Oladipo levels, whereas I think tyler herro will be similar to James Harden or Trae young once jimmy butler retires."
"Curry seems like a cool dude. But, imagine someone with Tyler Herro or Trae's face doing some of Steph's showboaty crap, and still being considered ""nice"""
It feels like the Heat have managed to win games despite a lot of off nights. Their 3 point shooting has been quite bad but they're somehow still pulling out wins due to Tyler Herro and Jimmy Butler
Tyler Herro
"He definitely becomes a lottery pick.  Zion Williamson, Ja Morant, Tyler Herro, Darius Garland, Cam Reddish, RJ Barrett are varying degrees of definitely to likely going ahead of him, but he gets bumped up past quite a few other players for sure."
Tyler Herro
"Embiid ain't built like that at all, and Tyler Herro?! lol"
Bro Tyler Herro?? Lmao
"James Johnson, Joel Embiid, Dwight Howard, Tyler Herro, Steven Adams"
"I really don’t agree with his slow decline take. He’s had a larger decline than you can see on paper. He’s played way less defense so he can exert more energy to collect stats. If you *actually* watch him play when he’s been on the lakers, he is SIGNIFICANTLY worse than he was on the cavs.   He was injured half the time in his first year, and they weren’t that spectacular when he wasn’t. Their ring was definitely a “Mickey Mouse” ring, how many stars were injured that year?? They got taken to 6 games against Miami with no Dragic, Bam’s corpse and your 2nd best player in Tyler herro. Then last year they had AD injured but even when they weren’t injured, they still looked pretty mediocre.   People are jaded and keep saying he hasn’t declined much. If you actually WATCH LeBron when he plays, he’s way worse than he was pre 2016"
AD's jump shooting is the face of bubble stats along with Tyler Herro.
"Yeah, Riley can't get it. On paper the moves look good, but it's not fully panning out yet at the 1/5th season mark. Tucker has been great. Lowry has been disappointing, but still an upgrade over Nunn. Re-signing Robinson looks very sketchy so far.  Most of what's been good of Miami this season has just been Jimmy Butler taking his game up to an MVP level and Tyler Herro improving."

"I don’t think he would beat out Tyler Herro for 6th man, especially if he’s only doing it for half a season."
Tyler Herro has a horrific attempt at a goatee going.
Tyler Herro is playing good defense
"I don't understand the delusion that Poole has any shot at MIP at all. He just is not consistent right now, especially against good defenses. His driving has improved (and is really impressive), but most of his efficiency and advanced stats are either flat compared to last year, or actually worse.   The idea that anyone would think he is in the running against players like Ja Morant or LaMelo, or even someone like Tyler Herro is just kind of, I dunno, embarrassing homerism?"
Tyler Herro @ me
Tyler Herro
Tyler herro
"Watching Tyler Herro this year and I think he has a crazy upside. He's already averaging like 22, can score from anywhere and has no fucking fear of taking any shot. When he's the no. 1 option in his prime I think he can be one of the best offensive players in the game."
Doubt he gets in. Even LaVine didn't get in averaging like 26 or Beal averaging 30 lol couple season ago  Tyler Herro - 21.7/5.5/3.9 on 18.7 eff  Cole Anthony - 19.6/6.8/5.9 on 20.8 eff  You can easily make a case that guys like cole anthony are having a better season rn too. I see this being the guard rotation for east.   (Trae/Lamelo) and LaVine starters  (Trae/Lamelo) and Harden  WC: Beal
"Tyler Herro, no bias here"
Cole Anthony is number 3 with 100 and Tyler Herro is 6th with 93. [Source] (https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;Period=4&amp;sort=PTS&amp;dir=-1) Pretty nice leap for both those guys.
Tyler Herro doesn’t strike me as someone who’s ever been good at tests
"Heat’s Tyler Herro explains getting caught in tangled web of NBA testing, ‘I felt like I was in jail’  Ira Winderman South Florida Sun Sentinel  Feb 13, 2021 at 2:26 PM  Miami Heat guard Tyler Herro said Saturday that he was putting on his uniform before Thursday night’s game against the Houston Rockets when he was told the result of his coronavirus testing would require additional inspection.  From there, “I felt like I was in jail.”  So there he waited, in a quarantine room at the Toyota Center, as further coronavirus testing was conducted.  Now back with the team, Herro detailed his unsettling hours in Houston, as he prepared for Saturday night’s game against the Utah Jazz, the second stop of the Heat’s seven-game trip.  “I found out like five minutes before [Heat coach Erik Spoelstra] came and spoke to the team,” he said of his Thursday whirlwind. “They said that I had a false positive, or I tested positive.  “I had to sit in the arena and watch the game in this little room. I completed like two or three tests and they all came back negative. So that allowed me to travel with the team.”  The NBA has such quarantine rooms in all arenas for just such eventualities.  “It was like a little tiny room. I felt like I was in jail,” the 21-year-old guard said. “The TV was tiny. And it had a shower, so I was able to shower and watch the game. It was all right. But, obviously, wanted to be out there, play, compete with the guys.  “I was just happy we were able to come up with the win and I was able to continue with the team on this road trip.”  Herro said there was no sense that anything was wrong after he completed his testing earlier Thursday.  “I had no clue,” he said. “I was literally putting my uniform on, getting ready to play. I went through my whole routine and everything. And, like I said, five minutes before, the trainers came and told me that I had tested positive.”  It was the third time this season Herro found himself in limbo with the NBA’s coronavirus protocols.  He previously had been held out of a Jan. 31 practice at AmericanAirlines Arena after a housemate returned what ultimately proved to be a false positive. He did not miss game action during that period.  Prior to that, he initially thought he would be among the players sent home from Boston on Jan. 11 due to contact tracing, but was spared that two-game absence, instead continuing on with the team for two games in Philadelphia.  He was asked Saturday if he felt jinxed.  “Yeah, I mean a little bit,” he said. “I feel like my name keeps coming up in it. Now we’ve had two false-positives under my name. It’s all a part of the world we’re living in right now. I just hope I don’t have to continue to deal with it.”  Herro said last summer he contracted COVID-19 during the NBA’s spring shutdown. He then produced several dominant performances during the Heat’s run within two victories of last season’s NBA championship.  “I mean, I have no clue how the virus works. We’re not doctors,” he said, when asked if he thought he could not contract the illness again. “We’re living in a crazy time right now, playing in the NBA and going from city to city. We’re getting tested daily, multiple times a day. So I feel like any guy could falsely test positive. That’s just the world we’re living."
Tyler herro with enough touches/shots on meh team could get close
Tyler “close calls with COVID” Herro
Tyler Herro bout to get Drew Bledsoe'd for Max Strus.
I miss Tyler Herro
"Extending Wiggins and then trading away the Markannen pick and Zach Lavine for Jimmy Butler fucked them over.  And then trading up for culver when they could have stayed put and got pj washington, brandon clarke, or tyler herro."
"The turnovers are bad but I think his shot selection is actually pretty solid, especially considering the role he’s often had to play in the bulls short handed offense this season.  I think everyone just sees that a lot of his faults could/would be papered over on a team where he didn’t have to do so much playmaking AND scoring.  Athletic two-guards with pinpoint accuracy are exactly the types of players who can tear up playoff defenses in the modern NBA. They’re offensive usefulness seems to even be surpassing the typical 6-8 power wing. Just look at who thrived in the bubble games: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, even Tyler Herro.  I salivate thinking about what Lavine would look like taking some pressure off guys like Giannis, Embiid, Jokic and Lebron."
I mean he’s no Tyler Herro but he is doing pretty good.
Don't we literally have a better record than you rn  Hope the Thunder use your lottery pick to draft someone better than Tyler Herro
nah its fine heat fans are just mad they chose tyler herro over james harden and couldnt throw money at giannis to leave a small market team  knicks heat beef is BACK

Tyler herro
i would take tyler herro for him but we saw that the heat fans wouldn’t even trade him for bradley beal because apparently tyler herro has james harden potential or some shit so i doubt we could get him
"It depends on what Toronto is asking for. Even though Lowry's contract is expiring, the Heat are likely looking for his bird rights. So Toronto might leverage those rights for a young prospect: ~~Tyler Herro~~, Precious Achiuwa, Duncan Robinson, or Kendrick Nunn.  Also, the Heat likely include some combination of Iguodala ($15m), Olynyk ($12m), and Leonard ($9.7m) to match salaries for Lowry ($30)."
Wasn't Tyler Herro a sticking point for Harden? Doubt they'll let go of him for Lowry on an expiring.
Yes because it was Tyler Herro + FRPs for James Harden that’s exactly what the trade was.
Miami Receives   Lebron AD Giannis Jrue Luka Porzingas   Lakers Receives  Udonis Haslem  Milwaukee receives   Tyler Herro  Dallas receives   Cash considerations and a second round pick
"Yes, the Heat would have done it for Tyler Herro, but Heat *fans* were saying that was too much"
Maybe if you include that Ignas wannabe in Tyler Herro well think about it.
Tyler Herro... people think his playoffs were a anomaly and that he’s a catch and shoot player.
need a tyler herro in there
"Miami’s window with Jimmy is very limited and Harden is what they’re missing. Tyler Herro is a nice piece but he’s not going to be Harden, and probably won’t even be an all star for a few years."
You know they wilding when a warriors fan agrees on the pro-Harden side lmaooooo.   This is a absolute steal. Miami better hope Tyler Herro can even end up a fringe all-star let alone the level Harden is.
"Well you gotta think about it. A couple years of older Harden vs 5+ years of Tyler Herro who is next in line of dominant offensive guards a la Jordan, Kobe, D Wade, even Harden..."
tyler herro is not worth 2 first rounders
"Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro, been waiting on a sex tape leak for a minute. 😍🔥🔥🔥"
"&gt;NBA media and r/nba: ""Tyler Herro, a bag of chips, and a 2nd for Beal who says no?""  As if heat fans arent asking for beal AND picks in exchsnge of their overrated young player number 4926294. Member when Winslow was totally on his way to be lebron 2.0?"
"You mean:"" Tyler Herro and you throw in a 1st and 2 bags of chips and we're still thinking not enough for a deal."""
"Bradley Beal: ""I want to stay in DC""  Tommy Sheppard: ""Beal isn't going anywhere""  NBA media and r/nba: ""Tyler Herro, a bag of chips, and a 2nd for Beal who says no?"""
"Yeah and if we’re being honest, Miami wouldnt even trade Tyler Herro for Doncic so how good is he really"
Whats the point? Miami still has Tyler Herro
we love our guys. have you not seen our tyler herro memes?
"Lol the top posts are Beal, Dipo, Tyler Herro meme, your post, then a post about LaVert and Allen"
I remember someone roasting Tyler Herro for being nicknamed buckets because thats the man who he is guarding gets
He’s phillys tyler Herro lmao
Yes Gabe Vincent and Tyler Herro who are both half a foot shorter than him created an impenetrable wall
"On the other side, Tyler Herro was really impressive. Looks like the Heat have a future All-Star on their hands."
Are you serious right now? Tyler Herro is worth more than James Harden and Steph Curry combined nephew
Tyler Herro two firsts and filler salary contracts are probably the best offer they get...
"Tyler ""almost 30% from 3"" Herro"
Tyler Herro jumps into the defender then flops backwards FTFY
Tyler Herro (snarl version only)
yeah if atlanta wanted a klay they wouldnt have taken cam reddish over tyler herro
"Honestly I think the best options for him are the Heat, 76ers, or still the Rockets here. I believe any superstar can win a title as long as they have the proper roster and do t choke in the playoffs.  Heat: Getting rid of Tyler Herro and/or Duncan Robinson for Harden would still be monumental for the Heat. Even if Harden is lazy defensively I’m sure Spo could convince Harden to try on defense for a championship(as Harden has shown he can be pretty good defensively when he tries). The only problem I’m worried about is if Harden can work in a team basketball environment, otherwise this is nearly a guaranteed finals appearance for the Heat.   Rockets: This team had amazing spacing. I think it’s too early to give up on them and the only reason the start of the season has been so wonky is because of the bubble. Same happened at the start of the lockdown season too(2011). This team has some real potential.   76ers: Getting someone like Harden is pretty much what they needed from day one after butler left. Trading him for Simmons and other assets would drastically improve their spacing. The only reason I would have doubts about them winning is that Harden has never played with an elite big man before, they’d definitely need some time to coexist(Harden and Embiid obviously)."
Man how do you get downvoted for this.  You always take an established star over a talented young player.  People said the same shit about the Wiggins for Love trade and look how that turned out.  Also those delusional heat fans that didn’t want to give up Tyler Herro lmao.   Jaylen is one of my favourite players in the league but a team that wants to contend and win a championship does that trade every time.
Tyler Herro

Tyler. Herro. Just broke his career high twice in a row
Lol you nearly lost to Tyler Herro and our third stringers.

Tyler herro and the third stringers impressed the league tonight
"Yes, moving him for Tyler Herro and a couple picks would be a lot better  Rather let him expire, for that return."
Players on the court this game:  - 2013 Finals Danny Green - Joel 'The Mailman' Embiid - Tyler 'Reggie Miller' Herro - Duncan 'Klay Thompson Who?' Robinson
Embiid n Tyler Herro have been unconscious
"This game has been awesome. Got Danny Green going crazy for three quarters, Tyler Herro and Joel Embiid taking over in OT, someone named Dakota hitting a shot to take the lead, Precious Achiuwa playing amazing, and potential for more of the Heat can score."
Tyler Herro is hitting a game winner
Tyler Legit Herro
Tyler Herro hates Philadelphia
They're all just taking turns with Tyler Herro imo
"Yeah people have corrected me on Boston having one of the 8 available enter protocols now so I take that back. But I’m saying look at this game sheet: https://twitter.com/jblevinsnba/status/1349080016324354049?s=21   And tell me how that upholds any kind of integrity of the schedule and whatnot. It’s not the Sixers playing the Heat at that point. Even if we had 12 guys and they had 8 and were down to rookies, Tyler herro and their 2 way players. It’s completely ridiculous. We’re gonna be on our 3rd game in 4 nights shorthanded with 3 of the 8 players being centers so really it’s 7 guys who can realistically play. Mike Scott is also one of them and is recovering from a leg injury and shouldn’t be thrust into big mins in a b2b situation. Health and safety of players is a joke right now."
Jimmy would’ve loved to have Middleton instead of Tyler herro
"Exactly.  Funny you brought that up actually since I think Tyler Herro said after the Lakers won that ""If the NBA was a video game, LeBron is the final boss"". Really goes to show the difference between the two."
"Who wins in a 3-point contest, you or Tyler Herro?"
"Which is why I think they're not trying to tank, they seem to be to have a solid core of starters that just need more time to develop. If you look at some of the top young players like Donovan Mitchel,  Jamal Murray, Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro they've been mostly mid first round draft picks. I feel OKC loaded up on draft picks so they can trade picks that work for their teams chemistry rather than getting  the best possible pick."
"I’m from Lexington and it seems to happen every year that a UK player goes either late In the lottery or first round because they didn’t shine in Coach Cal’s system, then they blossom in the NBA. Some recent examples include Bam, Shai, Tyler Herro, devin Booker, Jamal Murray, and hell even Tyrese, Quickley, and maybe even Hamidou."
"Tyler Herro first 50 points game , Niceeee"
"considering NBA players will be close to the end of the line, i doubt it.  If Tyler Herro is getting vaccinated before my grandparents (who dont like in a nursing home) or even my parents, Im gonna have serious issues with that"
Cough cough Tyler Herro
Yo Duncan big love I just need to know who the best player on the team is? And of course why it's Tyler herro?
Hey if you play the Celtics in the playoffs again tell Tyler herro to please not drop 37 again
"Hey Duncan, did Tyler Herro sell drugs to you in HS?"
How does it feel being the White Tyler Herro?
What do you think about Tyler Herro saying you should post more on IG to build your brand? He referred specifically to the game in the Finals where you went crazy from 3. Do you think it's important to build your social media following?
"r/nba meme review with Duncan Robinson. Sign me up. If you can get Jimmy Buckets and Tyler ""the Bucket"" Herro on together that would be a bonus, just saying."
"Hey Duncan, what's your favorite story with Tyler Herro?"
Any funny Tyler Herro stories?
Tyler Herro.😐
"Has Tyler Herro ever sold you a bag of weed, and then you get home and realize it’s oregano?"
Roommates are big Tyler Herro fans but I know who the real killa is. Love seeing you torch the court. Tell my roommates why you’re the real killa!!
What’s it like have Tyler Herro as a teammate? I’d imagine it would be very cool.
Are you mad Tyler Herro got a song before you?
"Hey Duncan! Thanks for doing this. How is it like being part of an organization like the Miami Heat, where there is so much emphasis on the development of guys like yourself and Tyler Herro? Also how did you manage to keep yourself motivated for your NBA dream once you were undrafted?"
Tyler Herro but no Sabonis lmao
Has Tyler Herro been good?  Kristaps hasnt played.....
Tyler Herro was ranked 59. I know the dude had a good bubble run but that is still ridiculous

Tyler Herro is good. Deni tried his best TMac impression lmao
"Hopefully this game will make the ""Tyler Herro has regressed"" people chill out. **31pts**, regular season high* (remember, he did score 37 pts in an ECF game)  gg Wizards - Garrison Matthews did his best to make us shit our pants as an All-Time Random Scrub Heat Killer but he was without his other 2 Big 3 members in Jordan McRae and Ian Mahinmi. If they were still with y'all, we woulda lost by 50 (lowkey we nearly lost to a scorching hot Deni Avidja anyway)"
He's not a scrub at all. He's going to be this year's Tyler Herro Kentucky steal of the draft.
"Tyler Herro, take it or leave it."
I remember idiots here trying to convince me that tyler herro is better than him lmao
"So nobody else in the bubble was tired? And Jimmy did all the work despite the fact that he wasn't the lead scorer leading up to the finals, Goran was. Not to mention Jae Crowder, Iggy, Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn. Not what I would call hero ball"
"This sub has massive short term memory. Like ridiculously short termed.  There were people saying Tyler Herro is better than Booker. Shit, I read some Heat fans saying they wouldn't trade away Tyler Herro in a package to get Harden.   Fucking bonkers"
Lemme have...uhhh...1 Tyler Herro with a side of Kelly Olynyk
Tyler Herro is a hero obviously
I swear there were missing points that weren’t recorded in those games. Points from Tyler Herro are still coming in!
is tyler herro just lu dort with a jack harlow song ???
Looking at you Tyler Herro :(
Tyler Herro looking like a Make-a-Wish kid in this
Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro as well
"Tyler Herro on the positive end, maybe Siakam on the negative side..."
Y'all have no halfcourt offense. It turns into a bad 3 or a Tyler Herro tough shot.
Tyler Herro gonna look back on this replay and box out harder and more often going forward. Caught watching the ball.
White Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro will be outta the league in 3 years
"In one series, in the bubble. Or do you think that Jamal Murray is an all-NBA First Team PG too? Or that Tyler Herro and TJ Warren are franchise players?"

"Raptors v Warriors went to 6 games....Heat v Boston went to 6 games but series wasn't nearly as close....cause reasons? The games were closer yes but Boston didn't suffer any highly critical injuries either, certainly not at the level of Klay and KD.   Dragic was always that type of player...him starting off the bench is a combination of developing young players, his age and getting a scoring punch off the bench. It has no bearing on his skills as a player. Tyler Herro, is a rookie so yeah i'll give you that but they also lost Kendrick Nunn who dropped off of a cliff due to covid after being a runner up for ROY so it balances out.   Anyways we don't have much more to say, we're never going to agree so lets just leave it at that."
"Raptors literally won a series off a Kawhi buzzer beater, literally 1 thing goes wrong and the whole series shifts. No, losing Hayward isn't the same as losing KD and some of Klay but that series wasn't nearly as close as the Celtics vs Heat, you know, gotta actually scale it.  To say its not luck, you gotta show some consistency. As far as statistics are concerned, Tyler Herro has only had 1 stint of scoring 19ppg on 63% TS. Dragic starting 3 games the entire season and then averaging 20ppg  in that series. A couple months after the finals with a similar sample size to that Celtics series, how are those guys doing? Just as well as you'd expect them to perform relative to their regular season work, not their playoff performance. They have not shown consistency to prove that they could've gotten to the finals even 5/10 times. People literally did the same shit to Jamal Murray and you don't see anyone defending him like he's a full blown high tier star thats about to average 26ppg on 62% TS."

Tyler Herro
Dude I’m 21 also and I remember how I was contemplating my life when I was sitting at home struggling with organic chemistry meanwhile Tyler herro was dropping 30 in the playoffs. It gets so weird when 19 year olds are heading into the NBA it makes me feel weird because Idk if it’s just me but I can’t fanboy over someone younger than me.
Tyler Herro had better stats his second season than his rookie year. After having basically a month and a half between seasons. He’s young people are blaming him way to much for the Heat not being better. He was hyped a little much but he took too much blame too.
Finally! the deal that gets Tyler Herro out of Miami.
"Did they? Now they don’t have to give up Tyler herro or other young guys. Y’all can have KZ, precious and groan lol. You just salty they made the right move and you know it"
What's worse the floor spacing or the foul baiting thatll go on amongst DeRozan/Butler/Lowry. Gonna be out of control. Tyler Herro about to be doing splits on every jumper kicking his legs out by December being around their influence
"Jimmy and the Heat felt that themselves this season. It's cool they overperformed and reach finals as 5th seed, but overperform is a word for a reason and Heat this season showed that.  In a smaller scale, this applies to Tyler Herro too."
"Lmao can’t even be upset or feel bad for the guy, when you’re a good looking, young NBA player making millions of dollars you should have some common sense and know better, same shit happened to Tyler Herro."
Yeah he was dating the ig model that is now having a baby with Tyler Herro
bc it fell off just like tyler herro
Surprised no one mentioned Tyler Herro by Jack Harlow.
"You're right, I was thinking Tyler Herro, got the two mixed up.  My bad!"
"They should have people like Tyler Herro on this team. Instead, we have a bunch of bums that have no interest in competing"
"yeah it's an unpopular opinion now but they definitely did want a token white guy.  As bad as Love is who was better and american, Tyler Herro?"
"&gt;""I'm a pretty boring person. I just play video games. I just chill and relax.""  -Every lottery pick for the past five years (except maybe Tyler Herro)"
I don't particularly care about Herro either way. You clearly don't watch Lakers games so I used Tyler as an example as to why players have slumps and it doesn't mean they're trash and should be traded. Seems like you're in the trade Tyler camp which actually isn't surprising at all.
"Right, that's a 6 game sample size while you ignore the fact that he played a pivotal part in their championship run averaging 10 on 38% and averaged 41% from 3 during the season. A Reasonable person would assume the Suns series was an anomaly rather than the norm and understand that it could be a one off. But I doubt you're capable of doing that. You'll fit in perfectly with the rest of the people in this sub.   It's like saying Tyler Herro was trash this year, he only averaged 10pts on 31% so let me just trade his ass because he's obviously useless and we'll lose nothing."
And he averaged 10pts on 38% during their championship run only a year earlier. He also shot 41% for the season. I usually place on emphasis on stats with context and try not to judge players on small sample sizes but this is r/NBA so I'm not surprised.   Tyler Herro averaged 9pts on 31% and that's his 3fg% as well as fg%. I'm guessing he's trash now too by your analysis.
I’ve just accepted that people are going to think until the end of time that Tyler Herro alone was the sticking point in Harden trade negotiations…even though that’s asinine
"Trade offer: Jimmy butler, Bam, Tyler Herro and 12 first round picks for Ben Simmons and a bag of Cheetos"

Like a mix between Tyler Herro and Zion Williamson
people say i look like a white tyler herro
Grant Hill is just a gorgeous man in general. He would be number 1 on my list. Probably Wally Szczerbiak. Tyler Herro is up there. Can we count Steph Curry’s mom?
"KCP is really good on defense. He’s one of the best guards getting over screens. You can look at the job he did against the Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro chasing them around. He wasn’t shooting well or shooting much in the Suns series but his perimeter defense was important. The only thing wrong with KCP’s perimeter defense is that he’s small for the bigger wings, but for the players in that 6’5 and under range, he is really good. This was a guy in the closing 5 of a team that largely relied on defense first to win a title. He was a meaningful part of that. This idea his defense is just replaceable, considering that he still shoots the ball fine for the most part, too does not match up with what I’m seeing. I doubt we are saying this if this team doesn’t get hurt.   The issue with Pope is his offense, just his offense. But he’s not a bad shooter and he’s one of the only guys on this team who can move with some burst off the ball and get a three or fire one up quickly. They run some of that for Kuz but he’s a 4, it’s not the same.   The Lakers don’t have enough shooters that you don’t mind losing one for a better one. Ideally you’d like to add them. I suspect this is all about KCP being good matching salary."
Closer to Tyler Herro-esque
"Fuckin Tyler Herro has a YouTube video on how he spent his first million. All I thought during the video was ""what a fucking idiot"""
"2 Minnesota 1sts,Beasley and Rubio are garbage but Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro isn't?"
"Morey really gonna take Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro over Rubio,Beasley and 2 1sts. You really gonna do us like that Daryl?"
"Uh, yes they do.  It’s just more prevalent in the NBA because a lot of these athletes used to come straight out of high school or play one year of college and dip out. There’s no financial education besides yes-men hanging out with you. What do you think they do with their money? Buy cars, jewelry, and try and bang IG models. Do you think that’s only inclusive to “Black people”? Look at guys like Tyler Herro and tell me where his money is going to go once he starts churning out kids with media influencers.  It’s simple in the NFL..these players go through the same thing and unfortunately most of their contracts have low guaranteed money. They make some, pay their taxes and child support, and then get hurt/decline and are out of the league.  You must be one of those people that think when I say someone comes from a “low income background” that it dictates the color of their skin. Poverty reaches all races and unfortunately a lot of NBA/NFL players DO come from low income situations.  And guess what? The vast majority of PROFESSIONAL athletes in the US have children with different women outside of marriage or end up divorcing. Why? Because they are easy targets for a paycheck. Simple as that."
"Minnesota Draft History since timberpups era began with a solid vet lineup  2020: Ant -1  2019: Culver - 6 (next SG/SF picks: Cam Reddish, Cam Johnson, Tyler Herro)  2018: Okogie - 20  2017: Justin Patton - 16 *had KAT (next SF/PF picks: Leaf, Collins, OG, DJ Wilson but that was even dumber)  2016: Dunn - 5 *had Rubio (next SG picks: Buddy, Murray) ... but also thibs kept trying to play LaVine at PG too  2015: KAT -1  2014: LaVine - 13, Wiggins - 1 *traded for Love  vets: Rubio, KG, Kevin Martin, Andre Miller, Tayshaun Prince, Pek  pups: Shabazz Muhammad, Dieng"
"Players drafted after Culver that may be better than Culver :   Coby White, Hachimura, Cam Johnson, Cam Reddish, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro, NAW, Okeke, Sekou, Goga, Bazley, Poole, Keldon Johnson, KPJ, Paschall, THT"
You’re totally right. Idk what this dude is smoking. That’s like me (a heat fan) saying Tyler herro is an all star after his playoff last year
Stop it man Tyler Herro is already dead
Tyler Herro and Zion are the duo of the future!
"I agree, but that was 4 games, and in those 4 games he shot 64% from 3.   At Duke, Cam shot 35.6% from the floor and 33% from 3.  His rookie year, Cam shot 38.4% from the floor and 33% from 3.  The first 26 games of this season before he got injured, Cam shot 36.5% from the floor and 26% from 3.   Cam was a ridiculously talented high school player and has basically stayed the same guy since high school.  Obviously, if he puts it all together, he could be a great player, but we've now seen 3 years of him basically being the same guy.   Imo, his playoff hot streak was great because it re-ignited everyone's excitement over his potential.  The way I see it, the Hawks are basically in a lesser version of the position that the Heat were in with Tyler Herro. A guy flashed something in the playoffs that's exciting but probably not sustainable. Now you have to decide whether you buy into the flash or flip the player while they're at their highest value."
&gt;After trading a package around Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro for Damian Lillard in 2022   That ain't happening.
This is Rolling Loud in Miami. People I’ve never seen take any interest in basketball know who Tyler Herro is down here. More people probably know Tyler than Bam tbh.   Source: am from miami
"""Aight what am I supposed to do?""  \-Tyler Herro"
To be fair El Pee was an awful coach by any imaginable standard and Cam was sidelined much of the most recent season with injury. He played a lot more confident under McMillan and showed some good potential in the playoffs. Still to be seen if his shooting was some bubble Tyler Herro type shit but he at least showed his value on defense

"Tyler Herro, the superstar"
I guarantee most of the people there don’t even know who Tyler Herro is. “Wait this song is named after a basketball player??”
Tyler Herro prob
Ben Simmons for Tyler Herro who says no?

Tyler Herro &gt; the entire 2021 draft class
France path to a mickey mouse win: No LeMickey No chef curry No Harden No ADisney No Kyle Kuzma No Tyler Herro
"""top 3"" So..... Zion, Ja, and Jordan Poole? For reference, this ranks Jordan Poole above: RJ Barret, Deandre Hunter, Darius Garland, and Tyler Herro. Those four are ***definitely*** above Poole, and most would have talents like KPJ and Keldon Johnson ahead of him too."
"Second half of the lottery probably?   Zion, Ja, Barrett, and Garland would be top 4.  The rest of the lottery would probably be (in some order): DeAndre Hunter, Coby White, Tyler Herro, PJ Washington, Matisse Thybulle, Cam Johnson, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr., Jordan Poole, Rui Hachimura. Maybe throw in Gafford or Clarke or Reddish or someone else instead.  Pretty weak draft so far, looking back on it."
"If OKC is enticed to drop protections on the 2023 FRP we gave them:  Miami gets: Bradley Beal  Washington gets: Tyler Herro, Precious Achiewa, 2024 FRP, 2025 FRP Swap, 2026 FRP, 2027 FRP Swap, 2028 FRP.  That’s nowhere near enough to get Brad unfortunately."
Would the Heat give up Tyler Herro for him this past season though.
"Tyler Herro, dude couldn't miss last playoffs"
Tyler Herro will be in G-League or China after his rookie contract
"if the Heat aren't offering Tyler Herro for James Harden, they aren't gonna trade him for Sexton"
"Taking Dame as an example, were he to ask for a trade, would have to look around the league at realistic trade destinations where they could still compete for a title. Maybe Miami, Boston, or Dallas? But beyond that Philly is the most obvious choice being in the East with an MVP level player next to Dame.  If you're Portland, Ben/Maxey/Mattisse + 3 firsts is about as good a deal as I think you're going to come across. Porzingis isn't a better deal, don't think Miami is trading Bam so you're looking at Tyler Herro, and then it's really down to the Celtics and Jaylen Brown.  I think when you look around the league, think about what Washington/Portland can do to become a contender, it's not that much. If you agree with me there, both players will be at a crossroads in their career choosing to stay put or go and try to win. This is very risky if we're holding out on so many variables but it does make sense when you consider who the sixers package is meant to beat. Is Simmons a great return for Dame? Of course not, but if he's asked out and you're trying to do him a solid by trading him to contender, the Ben + young players + picks is really not that bad. That's the logic anyway"
"Celtics:   2007: 2nd best lottery odds fall to 5th lose a chance at KD  2009: 44-11 C's deal with KG injury and don't make the finals  2010: Perkins misses game 7 of finals, Refs give the Lakers 37-17 FT advantage (20 in the 4th)  2012: Lebron plays the best game of his career ending the big 3 era  2013: Rondo tears ACL, Sullinger back injury out for season  2017: IT hip injury derailed everything and the curse of IT begins  2018: Hayward injury 1st game, Kyrie out for season before playoffs, Smart out for 1st round, we have the NBA Finals in our grasp and Brown and Rozier have the worst shooting games of their career and Jeff Green goes off  2019: Tons of talent but terrible locker room because of to many me guys, Kyrie does what Kyrie always does, Kings are good for one season and pick turns to shit, Philly pays Horford a shit ton of $ he can't turn down. We sign Kemba in a panic move.   2020: Kemba knee injury, Hayward playoff injury, Tyler Herro goes nuclear in ECF, Grizzles pick turns to shit  2021: Most covid missed days in league, Smart long injury, Brown out for playoffs, Tatum Covid, Fournier gets traded and gets covid a day later, Kemba doesn't start the year healthy &amp; doesn't play back 2 backs to end up missing playoff games anyway"

Tyler Herro shouldn’t be on that list 🤷🏼‍♂️
Its Tyler Herro
"I had to read the title 3 times before realizing it wasn't 'Tyler Herro, who is the best player on the Heat of all time'"
I never said we are trading Beal for this deal my hope is if we trade Beal we get like Ben Simmons and picks or Tyler Herro Precious Nunn and picks if you’re telling me we got from Russ and Beal to Kuzma THT Schroder Herro Precious Nunn and picks I think that’s speeds up your rebuilding process big time. We can’t risk Beal leaving for nothing in free agency that would set us back half a decade rebuilding wise
AH yes the ol Tyler Herro
I’m sorry but Tyler Herro does not have the power to seriously request a trade. He can request it and they can tell him to fuck off.
Jack Harlow bout to write Tyler Herro 2: Trade Rumour Boogaloo
"Who is more overrated, Tyler Herro or Devin Booker?"
Pretty much sums up Tyler Herro in the 2021 playoffs
~~500k or a dinner with Jay Z?~~  Your car or a chat with Tyler Herro?
Bruh for Tyler herro though? Like whyyy 😂
I guess he's worth a little around a Tyler Herro. He's still someone that was a DPOY runner up
No i think that’s Tyler Herro
"Our guys play hard and give it all on the court from start to finish. We're one of the top teams in the league when it comes to developing players and we're always looking to compete. In our 33 years as a team, we only missed the playoffs 11 times. We got swept badly in the playoffs last year, but we made some moves and are in the process of making some trades to come back stronger this season because, as I said before, we want to compete. We have a balanced roster of old and young players. I suggest watching highlights of Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, and Max Strus. Those are some of our young guys. We have arguably the best coach in the league by the name of Erik Spolestra. We pride ourselves on what we like to call Heat Culture, which is giving it all on the court until the final buzzer as I said in the first sentence. Overall, you'll feel very satisfied as a Heat fan while watching our games."
Fucking Tyler Herro in 2020 ECF
"&gt; You're right, his trade value wasn't really in question.  You kidding me? Every team balked on trading for harden. Boston, Miami, Milwaukee, GSW, Portland. All i heard was he's fat, bad for the culture, not worth tyler Herro/CJ Mcullum, etc."
Damn Lebron and the Lakers beat powerhouse superstars like Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson! The league has evolved so much
If Tyler Herro really looked like Millie Drake would've been a Heat fan.
https://heatnation.com/rumors/heres-the-ridiculous-package-the-rockets-wanted-from-the-heat-for-james-harden/   This is an article from Heat media right after the trade.   They called this ridiculous:   * Tyler Herro * Duncan Robinson * Precious Achiuwa * Kendrick Nunn * Salary Filler * Two 1st-Round Picks * 4 Pick Swaps
It's not as bad as Heat fans valuing Tyler Herro over Harden.  But there are two different views of Thybulle anyway. One of those views ignores he played less than 20 minutes a game in the playoffs.
"&gt;Tyler Herro will be a career bench player   &gt;   &gt;Volume Off-ball scoring is the most valuable skill in the game.  I like these two together, because the second one explains exactly why Duncan Robinson is a starter and Herro mostly comes off the bench, despite Herro being more athletic and better at most other aspects of the sport."
"Bam. He's just too special of a talent that's molded by the franchise. Although we keep wanting to push him into being more aggressive on the offensive end, he's a top notch defender and gets better every season. Also, for the LAST time, Tyler Herro wasn't the reason the Harden trade fell through. If it was just Tyler Herro for Harden straight up, we would have gotten that done the same day. Houston asked for more shit than we had, end of discussion."
Tyler Herro easy
If we’re talking for during 2020-2021 then Tyler Herro easy
"The 06 Finals were rigged for Miami. The NBA betting scandal was discovered the next year.  Paul pierce and dwade are pretty even all time, numbers/accolades aside.  Lebrons skills as a GM cost him a ring  KG is the greatest PF all time because Duncan played more minutes at center.  Jokic will have more rings when he retires than Luka.  Jayson Tatum will end up being the best player of his generation. ie when lebron/curry/KD/Harden retire he is the next man up.  Tyler Herro will be a career bench player   Volume Off-ball scoring is the most valuable skill in the game.  Forcing all rookies to play there first year in the G-league or be  at least 21 years old would make the league substantially better to watch.  The next big thing teams are overlooking is offensive rebounding. It will be the new 3pt shooting.  David Stern was an asshole but a great commissioner."
[Tyler Herro](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTi8BtGDkBS/?utm_medium=share_sheet) is next.
He in fact did sweep Tyler Herro
But he *would* get swept by tyler herro right?
"despite saying your young players will make a leap, I think the opposite will happen, they either will have a meh performance (Tyler herro effect) or injuries might occur. That’s just my hot take though"
This must mean that Tyler Herro &gt; Jayson Tatum.
Tyler Herro is not even a top 50 player in the NBA 😂
"I feel like we're neck and neck, but Duncan Robinson is one of the best 3 point shooters in the league and is breaking records while at it. Bam was a top DPOY candidate. Tyler Herro might be a cornerstone 6MOTY, Kendrick Nunn was ROTY runner up and if we wanna go back in time, we developed arguably the 3rd best shooting guard in NBA history."
"I feel like Miami is probably even better than Toronto-- Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn were both undrafted players. Bam Adebayo, way better than draft outlook. Herro better than draft outlook. Team frequently finds G league diamonds in the rough. A lot of your teams rotational players were at some point Heat development projects (Tyler Johnson, Derrick Jones Jr, Josh Richardson, etc etc.)"
"PG: Kyle Lowry  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: Duncan Robinson  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Bam Adebayo  Key Bench Players: Tyler Herro, Victor Oladipo, Max Strus, Markieff Morris, Dewayne Dedmon"
"lonzo, i hated his ugly ass hair and rat face when he was on the lakers but now he doesnt have that haircut anymore so i dont hate him as much.  here are some players i currently hate:  kelly oubre  kyle kuzma  pj tucker   tyler herro  jalen green    here are some i dislike:  devin booker  anthony davis   shai although i dont want to   danny green  james harden   frank jackson   mpj  kristaps   ben simmons"
"""Fuck no I wouldn't trade Tyler Herro for James Harden, did you see how fat Harden looks!?"""
I wonder who the youngest player in history is to record a double-double in a Finals game? I was thinking Tyler Herro? Idk if he even got a double double  Keep these coming OP
Your fan base (and FO) thought James Harden is not worth trading Tyler Herro for. Tell me which one is a more embarrassing take?
"Wait, that's not Tyler Herro rofl"
"Didn't know Tyler Herro was Asian, learn something new everyday on r/nephew"
That doesn't look like Tyler Herro lol
Basically who's the next Tyler Herro and Kyle Kuzma.
Tyler Herro
Tyler herro
&gt;The Heat not wanting to give up Tyler Herro in a James Harden trade  I'm just here to let you know that this didn't happen
"Tray Young, Tyler Herro, The Denver Kid who said Dončić is overrated."
"THT, KPJ, Tyler Herro, and Maxey in my view. Mostly cause they’ve led to trade blocks for established superstars."
Tyler Herro for me. I know he’s not the most popular guy but I love the guy. After his performance in the bubble he’s got a pretty solid spot in my heart.
"As a heat fan it pains me to admit this, but I’d say it’s probably Tyler Herro"
Tyler Herro
"A year ago, it would have been Simmons, but people have wizened up by now.    These days, it's hard to tell.  People seem cautious/critical of young guys.    I guess maybe Tyler Herro? But things have cooled off since their finals win.    One might say Talen Horton-Tucker, but I think everybody outside of LA knows that he's just getting the typical LA-hype.    People might say Anthony Edwards, but people haven't been overhyped about him.    Ja has proven he isn't just hype.    Booker to.    Ayton as well.    It's hard to find a young guy that gets hyped these days that doesn't get an equal amount of criticism.    If anything, people seem to be extremely harsh of young guys these days. If 19 year olds don't play like All-Stars by their second season, people act like they are a bust.    So this is a hard question."
Probably Tyler Herro
Tyler herro mom does
I saw people say Tyler Herro and others but I was thinking more like stars and since half of the population here will write Ben Simmons I’ll go with Trae. He is a good-ass player but I don’t ybderstand the Steph Curry comparisons. Trae is a great fascilitator but he is really inefficient in terms of scoring. He tries to create his own shot most of the times and takes unnecessary dribbles costing the efficiency of that possesion. He is a top 20 player in the league but let’s stop acting like he is Steph Curry who has Kyrie’s handles. Steph’s shooting efficiency is soo far ahead of Trae’s and his movement without the ball. People also say how he uses streetball type moves like Kyrie but people don’t understand their difference. Trae actually does moves that don’t work well but look entertaining. Kyrie uses fundamental moves with his own spice on it making them lethal but also efficient for one on one possesions.
Well he's pretty rated right now but currently Ben Simmons in both talent and contract. Brad Stevens was definitely over hyped and took himself partially out. I think we owe 2-3 months to prove himself in CLE. Tyler Herro had way too much trade value.
RJ Barrett is better than not only Tyler Herro but Ja Morant
Literally no one talks about Tyler Herro as a great young talent anymore
"These headlines still make me lol. Even if they aren't true, it's wild that he was considered near untouchable.  https://twitter.com/GregSylvander/status/1337040380911644675?s=20  [https://heatnation.com/rumors/report-miami-heat-reluctant-to-include-tyler-herro-in-sign-and-trade-deal-for-kyle-lowry/](https://heatnation.com/rumors/report-miami-heat-reluctant-to-include-tyler-herro-in-sign-and-trade-deal-for-kyle-lowry/)"
"Tyler herro, hes alright but hes not all that."
"Flukey af, TJ Warren turned into prime MJ, Tyler herro was the next Miami heat great, AD all of a sudden became a great shooter, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell turned into supernovas. Quite frankly the 2020 playoffs should be expunged from the history books, including the lakers Mickey Mouse ring"
"I think they are about even, but Kyle Lowry theoretically does fix a lot of problems for Miami. They get a very good guard defender giving them a great switchable defensive guard/wing/big combo in Lowry, Butler, Bam. He can be an off-ball shooter with Butler playmaking or be the lead playmaker and scorer for the team.   Miami had the same winning percentage as Milwaukee last year when Jimmy Butler played. They also added PJ Tucker and if Tyler Herro looks a bit more like his rookie year self, this team is very well constructed."
Remember when the whole heat fan base didn’t want James harden bc they would have to give up Tyler herro
&gt; He has so much confidence and swagger in the way he plays. I feel like he is the next big thing in NBA.  2020 Tyler Herro  2019 Ben Simmons  2018 Kyle Kuzma
Tyler Herro?
Who has a better offer if he's available? You like R.J. Barrett as a centerpiece? Or Tyler Herro?
"Larry bird, jerry west, Steve Kerr, Tyler herro"
Tyler Herro. Our bench scoring and offense will heavily rely on him
Tyler Herro 🤞
Tyler Herro was not a good song. Don't u/ me.
Tyler Herro wasn't as big of a song as MO Bamba. Even my British football( soccer) coach was bumping to thst shit.
"Compared to Tyler Herro?   We may be close, depending on how their careers play out"

"Yeah. Because a good agent would have told Dion Waiters to his face, “You’re complaining about Tyler Herro and Goran Dragic getting more minutes than you instead of blaming the guy you see in the mirror who is an out of shape creature who consumes shady edibles.”"

Tyler Herro shaking in his boots
"Kawhi first finals was year 2 and they lost, he balled out and won FMVP in year 3.. then again in 2019 with the raptors lol. I was talking about Tyler Herro. For the Drake one, it’s rumored he’s tryna get with Sonya Curry. For the top, that’s Jamal Murray"
That’s more of a fit tho I wouldn’t say most teams are in the blazers position. For example I doubt the heat would trade let’s say Tyler herro for simmons even though herro is worse than cj.  It would just ruin the dynamic of the team and you would have cashed in your best asset for someone that doesn’t fit.

"Here is my quick attempt off the top of my head,  *Sabonis does not count even though he is American born. He represents Lithuania internationally and clearly has embraced that culture, his dad was just playing in the States when he was born.  1st Team  Tyler Herro- Joe Harris- Duncan Robinson- Gordon Hayward- Brook Lopez  2nd Team  Alex Caruso- Kevin Huerter- Pat Connaughton- Kevin Love- Cody Zeller  3rd Team  TJ McConnell- JJ Redick- Doug McDermott- Zach Collins- Mason Plumlee or Frank Kaminsky  The issue is that there are much better guards than forwards and especially centers. I feel like Donte is probably better than JJ at this point, but I gave Redick the legacy choice."
Tyler herro was ranked higher than derozen last year for some reason
They really missed jae crowder a lot last season. Ariza was okay but PJ&gt;ariza. Dragic fully healthy is underrated but even so Lowry&gt;dragic especially since lowry should be healthier. Nunn gone means clearer opportunities for tyler herro who was a huge reason for their 2020 finals run. Also if oladipo gets healthy at any point he can replace nunn even if hes washed. Morris is an upgrade to their bench too. Im a celtics fan but I think the heat clearly got better
Morris brings that energy he’s an upgrade over Ariza. But Nunn could barely stay on the court late season. Why are you acting like he was a huge factor? The biggest factor is if Tyler Herro can take a step. Because Lowry is a clear upgrade over Nunn and Dragic combined
"Klay Thompson ! Haha naw Kevin love , Gordon Haywood, Duncan Robinson, and Tyler Herro.  Prob going with Duncan Robinson for my 2022 pick"

Is Tyler herro a one hit wonder
Untouchable Tyler Herro really doing a lot of good for the Heat right now lol. Nunn as your starting PG in the playoffs was never going to end well either.

"if the nets win the chip all it means is that if you have any sort of chance to get former mvp level players still in their prime, just do it. and if you have to trade young guys to make space just do it  cough miami heat tyler herro"
I believe Tyler Herro's HS videos as well. Was the state championship final and the kids supporting the other team were heckling him. Herro dropped like 40 lmao
"He simply just has the most eyes on him. More people, more idiots. Every L like an “embarrassment” and until he wins again he’s “not even close to MJ”. Insta fans are the WORST lol, it’s 1000x more reactionary than here and half the people there say shit like “Tyler Herro is better than LeBron” and mean it, like they make a “cool” graphic to go with it and everything and it gets likes lol."
Should also check out tyler herro doing the same shit. Its fucking great
THEY SAID TYLER HERRO WAS BETTER
AND YALL SAID HE WAS WORSE THAN TYLER HERRO
TYLER HERRO AINT DOIN THAT IS HE
Tyler Herro and Jamal Murray disagree.
Anthony “Tyler Herro” “TJ Warren” Disney
"That lotto pick was a MIA/SAC coin flip away from being Tyler Herro, too"
That's when we knew Jim wasn't about that Heat culture like Tyler Herro.
"No. Jimmy Butler quits and goes back to Minnesota, Tyler Herro recommits to Wisconsin, Nunn goes back to U of I to finish college, Duncan Robinson finally becomes a sports writer, Dragic goes to play Serbian ball. Pretty much donezo series"
is that tyler herro?
"If Curry, Westbrook and Tyler Fucking Herro can get boards at their heights then so can Tingus Pingus."
Tyler herro should be playing not ariza
Tyler Herro is too young for the promise Riley made to Jimmy Butler
I can see Miami trading Tyler Herro
Tyler herro dpoy
Did Giannis just settle for a jumper against Tyler Herro lmaooo
"Where is Tyler ""Better than James Harden"" Herro?"
Duncan Robinson plays like how bleacher report imagines Tyler Herro plays
why Tyler Herro got the nickname Baby GOAT on basketball reference 😭😭😭
They should sit tyler herro
Whenever you get young white shooters there always one who is a fucking shooter and another that got carried to a finals appearance and now thinks he’s basketballs MGK ( Tyler herro)
"Lopez and Tucker both have 3 fouls lmao. Fuck you refs. Meanwhile Tyler fucking Herro has shot more FTs than Giannis, who has taken 16 shots.   FUCK YOU REFS"
"Tyler herro was so good Heat didn""t want Harden"
Tyler Herro looks like Eleven from Stranger Things
"Jimmy getting soft calls ngl. If that was Tyler Herro, refs wouldn’t bat an eye"
Tyler Herro is not very good lol
Remember Tyler Herro was a thing lmfao
When people say Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson have similar game I know that they don't watch the Heat often
"And Tyler herro made the finals before Ja and RJ. And Carmelo made the playoffs before lebron lol.  Come on, Zion is by far the best player from his draft, and it's not close at all. Just look at any major impact metric."
Tyler herro Vietnam flashbacks
Tyler Herro.
I’d take Keldon &amp; or Dort over Tyler Herro.  Also Brandon Clarke has a case over Thybulle.
"Tyler Herro isn’t a millennial though. Jimmy is the millennial. Good news though, Herro can rent a house from Jimmy for more in monthly rent than Jimmy is paying for the mortgage, property tax, and maintenance combined!"
&gt;We saw a microcosm of Bird last year with Tyler Herro  Okay let's relax lmao
"Could you imagine if Larry Bird was having his rookie season right now? In fact we don't even have to imagine it, NBA ratings exploded after Bird came into the league and dominated. Luka still gets a little hurt by the fact he's still European   Bird was truly the Eminem of the league, it wasn't his fault he was white and good but it certainly helped. We saw a microcosm of Bird last year with Tyler Herro"
Milwaukee legend Jordan Poole way better than Milwaukee suburb fraud Tyler Herro
Bruh everyone know Tyler Herro got hood tendencies don't do him like that
Lol imagine if Tyler Herro posted this what a wacky world we would live in huh wow lol
Could you imagine if Tyler Herro bought this jacket and wore it? Assuming he equally has no clue to its perceived connotation. Haha wow
I dont think people realize how much anything can happen in one game. Even tyler herro stole a game from Lakers last year in the finals
"If Im Tyler Herro, Im shitting my pants."
"Tyler Herro, Super Hero, Guitar Hero, Lakers in 5."
"I posted a picture of Tyler herro flying from a collision during a lebron drive like 2 months after the championship on our sub. Just thought it would be a laugh, no biggie. Gets crossposted to r/heat and I regret responding trying to cool the flames, I was ripped into oblivion."
"Butler and bam both carrying, with tyler herro/robinson popping off almost every game. How well can the nets stop the heat offense i dont really know"
"Khris Middleton has some silky smooth games. Tyler Herro (still early in his career) but he has some plays where it seems like he knows where everyone is and what they’re gonna do on defense and premeditated moves to get pass them, very silky"

Tyler Herro acted like he averaged that
"It doesn’t matter and we’ll obviously never know, but I think the Celtics win the series if they win game 4. They tie the series 2-2 and have all the momentum. They won game 5 in a blowout already. You can say the complexion of game 5 would be different if the series is 2-2 instead of 3-1 Miami, but I can tell you that Boston’s record in game 5s when the series is 2-2 is ridiculous. Something like more than 90% in the past 20 years.   Anyway yeah, I think the Celtics win the series if they win game 4 but they didn’t because Tyler Herro."
If I'm Tyler Herro I'm coming into this thread right now to kick some ass
I mean it depends   Are we talking like   Basic Ass white boy attractiveness: Tyler Herro  Most attractive overall: Blake Griffin  Controversial Pick: Deandre Jordan  Or you are actually confused if he’s just an model on an extensive photoshoot and not an actual NBA player: Kevin Love  Or if you have a ostrich fetish: Chris Bosh
okay who’s better jordan poole or tyler herro?
Is he worse than Tyler herro though?

Tbf Lebron won against Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro in the bubble and MJ won against Stockton and Malone
3 trade with miami getting back one used tyler herro
Kemba to Miami for some kind of Tyler Herro/picks package.
"Chipotle would like to make this clear on Tyler Herro: ""He's a core bowl. That's all there is to it."""
"Role player who got hot in the playoffs is the next superstar on the cusp of being a top 10 player (i.e. Tyler Herro). The playoffs aren't some mythical land where only the worthy can perform, sometimes a guy matches up well against an opponent or gets hot at the right time.   To this day people still think Eli Manning is some sort of god that can activate his clucth gene only in the playoffs, completely forgetting the 4 times he lost in the first round. He got hot twice, that's it. He isn't clutch, no one is. Clutch doesn't exist."
"Tyler Herro couldn't even get real minutes when they were getting blown out, Oladipo has glass legs, Bam is stupidly over paid and Robinson is a solid shooter but far from a 1st option."
"I wanna say the Heat but after reading some of the other packages mentioned in this thread, we don’t got the juice. Best we could do is Duncan Robinson via S&amp;T, Tyler Herro, Precious Achiuwa. If we could incentivize OKC to get involved by removing the protections on the picks we owe them, it frees up draft capital to be able to send to the Wizards as well.   There are stronger offers out there though"
We don’t have shit lol. How does one Tyler Herro sound?
Tyler Herro in the playoffs last year maybe.
Tyler herro?
"I wonder if he’ll end up in the semi-overrated camp like Tyler Herro. Could make sense for daryl to pounce with such a high peak value this off season after the Sixers lose in the ECF to winner of bucks/nets. I still think Embiid is worth going all in on, even if his knee requires surgery, and as much of a baller as maxey is I think having him as untouchable this off season could be an error.  That being said, I LOVE his energy on the court. He tries to dunk everything, shows no fear, is always talking and communicating on the floor. He’s gonna be in the league for a long time"
&gt;Said he'd give up 5 1st round picks for Tyler Herro  ????? Yo what. Was there any reasoning? Lmao this is wild
"I don't fault you for citing them but those rankings have in recent years (that is to say if it hasnt always been like this) is to deliberately have bad rankings to, as you said, have everyone argue over them. Any list that has Tyler Herro as the 59th best player in the entire league isn't really worth taking seriously"
"I've been told that Tyler Herro, despite looking like a very classy sportsman, has certain tendencies associated with lets say non scrappy gym rats"
" Along with Joe Harris, Frank Kaminsky, Grayson Allen, TJ McConnell, Duncan Robinson, Joe Ingles, Tyler Herro, Myles Leonard, Cody Zeller, Gordon Hayward. LOVE those guys. First team all class."
"“Tyler Herro could barely get off the bench.”  49 of 55 GP with 20 minutes or more.  21 of 55 with 30+.  9 of 55 with 35+.  2 of 55 with 40+.   Averaged 16PPG in the playoffs... scored 16 or more in 23 of 55 games played in the regular season, 20+ in 12/55.   He played this year pretty much in between his averages from last regular season and his averages from the playoffs, while dealing with a nagging foot injury for most of the season (that was reaggravated right before the playoffs in the Detroit game.   TJ Warren had some outstanding bubble performances, but he also had some outstanding performances prior to the shutdown, albeit not a 53 point outburst. A 36 point game in January and a 35 point game in February stand out... he also dropped 33 a couple of times as well.  I feel like a lot of people were shocked by Miami, but I also think a lot of people weren’t paying that much attention to Miami in the regular season. Miami had pretty significant success against Milwaukee in the years prior, and have traditionally been pretty solid defensively. We shot lights out the whole season. A solid defense and great 3 point shooting usually takes you pretty far.   The bubble was weird, but so is this season. Some teams started the season with almost a year’s worth of rest; others started with barely two months’ worth. Injuries have been insane. COVID protocols affected everybody. In a lot of ways, this year is as weird as last year’s. But if the Finals had been something like Clippers vs. Bucks, I don’t think there’s nearly the same amount of talk about “bubble frauds.”"
Kevin Love Tyler Herro Duncan Robinson Gordon Hayward Grayson Allen
Heat were an option but they felt they were better off with Tyler Herro.
Devil's advocate. It more so that the way some guys played in the bubble was a bit of an anomaly.  TJ Warren flat out balled out in the bubble. Never did this prior. Tyler Herro balled in the bubble.  He could barely get off the bench. Lakers didnt shoot the 3 that well the whole season. Get to the bubble playoffs and it seemed as they couldnt miss. Milwaukee didn't seem to want to be there after the protest. A lot of guys struggled in the bubble with depression i.e Paul George. So I do get what people say about the bubble.
You mean tall Tyler Herro?
Jamal Murray had a tough stretch for part of this season compared to his playoff performances but overall he's been a killer.  Maybe could argue Tyler Herro was looking like a potential future superstar based on the bubble.
Trade LeBron for Tyler Herro or something.
Tyler Herro is available
"Kuzma is trash. How he tricked the Lakers to keep him, I at least get Tyler Herro because he showed up in the bubble, but what did he do"
If they sign jimmy to a fuckpill deal like that but wouldn’t trade shit ass Tyler herro for Kyle Lowry that franchise is run by dumb old people with bad brains
TYLER HERRO WEST
Almost as silly as James harden for Tyler herro trade rumors isn't it?
&gt;\[MIA\] Tyler Herro  there's always a reason people act up.
Idk what makes people think Tyler Herro was the reason Miami didn't trade for Harden. I wonder if people are that dense or just knowingly make shit up so they can make their shit jokes
"pshh, Tyler herro could do that in his sleep"
"The protections on the pick owed to OKC prevents Miami from trading any unconditional first round picks, which is a big reason they couldn’t get in on Harden. They will gain a 2028 pick that can be traded after the draft though, but that’s the only tradable pick they can get if they can’t get OKC to lift the protections on the 2023 pick (which OKC won’t do without good compensation).   Tyler Herro and Precious Achiuwa are their only two young trade assets. Achiuwa has little trade value and Herro’s value took a massive dip.   As a result of all this, Miami isn’t in position to get a high end star in a trade because they would be easily outbid by a number of other teams.   Only way to salvage the trade cupboard would be internal improvement from Herro and Achiuwa."
Downvote me if you want but I'm still a Tyler Herro believer
whats miami's future look like?  Tyler herro and bam? two bubble players
No he isn't. Tyler Herro is a Gen Z Kyle Korver at best.
Tyler Herro -- Kuzma of the East  Bam -- Draymond Green of the East  Butler -- Russ with better PR  Duncan Robinson -- Taller JJ Redick  What else ?
Building your future around Tyler Herro is more risky.
tyler herro peaked at 20
"Was Tyler Herro the guy who went up to the kid playing basketball and asked to take a shot thinking the kid would be amazed to see him, and the kid had no idea who he was and he airballed it and then left? Or was that Duncan Robinson?"
"And Tyler Herro scored 37 points in the ECF in a WINNING effort, but you dont see anyone saying herro&gt;ja"
Tyler Herro and Kuzma are probably more popular than Middleton and Jrue lmao
Their other option is struggling to reach .500 for the next few years with Bam Adebayo being backed up by Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson
"Tyler herro, dude balled out for one season and is just living his best life at the moment.  On another note: unironically Kwame Brown. The way that dude carries himself after the shit he's gone through/shit he got thrown at him. He's made millions and can live off of fuck you money for the rest of his and his children's lives."
Tyler Herro snd some garbage for Harden doesn't sound too bad now
Tillman was never sending Harden back to Morey. Miami fucked up bad refusing to include Tyler fucking Herro in a trade for an MVP
Who was that?  Tyler Herro?  Guy looks kinda tall so maybe a player?
But they have... TYLER HERRO
"Addition by subtraction. You have TOO many like-players. Even worse it’s a combo of young guys and vets. So the young guys will naturally defer to older guys, and/or the coach will lean on the reliable older guys, when really the young guys should get minutes and a chance to shine and make mistakes. So along those line…  Put the ball in Tyler Herro’s hands. In the modern game, yea, he can run point. Similar to Jamal Murray. And similar to Jamal Murray, remember just a few years ago when Gary Harris(and to a lesser extent Will Barton) were seen as interchangeable with Murray? Harris was more stable, older, but Murray had the upside. Denver finally took off when that was cleared up.   For the Heat they have like 2 or 3 ‘Gary Harris’ guys. Dragic, Nunn, even had Avery Bradley. They need to trim some good players and give Herro big minutes. He is their highest upside player. I refuse to believe it was just the bubble. I think it’s the glut of guards, him deferring a little, him playing off-ball, and the fame overwhelmed him   Lastly, trade Jimmy Butler. As someone else pointed out, he has value to a contender. This is your last chance to get value for him   In my best case scenario for Miami:  -Trade Jimmy Butler to Atlanta in sign and trade for John Collins    -Let Goran Dragic walk, or sign and trade to a desperate contender for a projected late 1st (Philly, LA, Bucks)  -Let Ariza walk  -Let Iggy walk   -Sign Nunn on a friendly deal but do NOT overpay. He’s not THAT good. Move him to 6th man   -Re-sign Oladipo. Prove it deal   2021-22 Lineup  Herro   Oladipo  Robinson   Collins    Bam  6th man- Nunn  -Pat Riley and thr city of miami will be enough to sign the remaining guys. Your lineup is thinner, but you have better hierarchy and pathways for 3 guys to become stars (herro, Collins, Bam)  That ‘5 guys who average 15 a game’ blueprint has never worked"
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
Some body types just seem to get more wear and tear I think. The ones with strong frames but thin muscles. Tyler Herro starting to look like that too.  All the extra muscle helps protect the joints. Like a strong skeleton and tendons without muscle mass is short use and abuse.
Loll me and my friend were talking about who we wanted to date. Id happily go out with Tyler Herro. She said Gordon Hayward
He is a sharpshooter that looks like a methhead lol. It also sounds like steph or more so seth. Also reminds me of the splash crackers Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro.
"I don't think Pat Riley would really ever tolerate Harden anyway, but not giving up Tyler Herro for him is looking REALLY rough right now."
The Tyler Herro route
Either Tyler Herro or KP is going to break the color barrier for the African League.
That second round pick could turn into anything. Even Tyler Herro.

The West’s Tyler Herro is back at it again
Imagine forcing a trade off the T-Wolves because Townes is soft and then looking across the huddle to see Tyler Herro with the same uniform. Hahaha! This shit writes itself!!!
"relax pat riley is a literal genius 2nd coming of jesus ""Allah"" christ. He was smart enough to pass on harden and lowry to keep Tyler ""Second Coming Of Mohammad"" Herro. He has a master plan here"
Kuzma the Tyler Herro of the West.
"I mean Tyler Herro is Bubble Boy until proven otherwise.  And Adebooty is funny, too."
remember when everyone was ready to crown tyler herro as the next superstar
who fell off worse: randle or tyler herro?
"You're acting like Jrue Holiday is a 1st team all nba player lmao. Hes not even an all star. Adding Jrue Holiday is not enough of a difference to where the team that made the Finals gets swept in the first round. The Heat's success was because of the bubble. Butler is overrated. Tyler Herro is a bum. There is no ""Heat culture"". They are a bubble team. Just accept it."
Tyler Herro dropped 38 in the conference finals and I’d rather have a top 3 pick in this years draft than him.
Harden doesn’t fit Heat culture.  (Max Kellerman voice) I want Tyler Herro! 😤
Would you rather have Tyler Herro for the next 10 years or a delicious Hero Sandwich for the next 10 minutes?
"They'll take Tyler ""Better than Harden"" Herro obviously"
"Heat fans, who would you rather have: Tyler Herro or James Harden?"
I don't get why Tyler Herro is getting memed when Julius has been so much worse
[Baby Snarl](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2020/10/tyler-herro-snarl-face-reaction-heat-lakers-nba-finals)
Tyler herro last year
Can both statements be true? The Bucks are so much better but the Heat regressed. Bryn Forbes played better than Jimmy or Tyler Herro.
"Tyler ""Better than Harden"" Herro couldn't even average double digits"
It was gross. Also Tyler Herro underperformed badly too
I think the trade they wanted was to fleece Houston for Harden lol... would that not make sense? All of sudden when reports come out that Harden wants a trade suddenly Tyler Herro is untouchable? Come on man.... don’t lie to me and tell me you just started watching the nba this week.   And no one mentioned Lowry... idk if heat should of traded for him.. don’t think he pushes the needle especially when they can get him in free agency
"Also, this Miami team was not as good. Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro are not playing as well as they were last year. They also miss Jae Crowder."
"This is so stupid, I hate posts that try to say one thing is 100% wrong because some other thing is 100% correct. There’s never any nuance on here. As always, both things are true.  Going from Bledsoe to Jrue Holiday is a ridiculous upgrade, the Bucks are clearly much better and more dangerous than they were last year. Bucks-Nets could end up being the best series of the whole postseason.  But just the same, Jimmy Butler was awful this year in the playoffs. Tyler Herro went from an up and coming star (which was stupid at the time) to just “a guy”. Bam also went from a dominant force to a guy who was afraid to shoot a 10 foot jumper."
Tyler Herro also got exposed for being quite overrated :/
"While you’re right, this is as empty of a statement as saying Miami are frauds.  Present your evidence!  It’s bountiful.  We learned what the game looks like when Giannis guards Jimmy - Jimmy struggles.  Tyler Herro is not playing anywhere near the level he did in the bubble and I don’t think anyone is sure why, but it’s a huge factor.  Jrue Holiday is a huge acquisition and I didn’t check this for sure, but I’ll bet he led the Bucks in +/- this series.  He’s a huge upgrade over Eric Bledsoe who honestly really struggled with anxiety and pressure in playoff games.  You say “getting punched in the mouth made them hungrier and angrier” but I mean, that’s just something you say in hindsight that doesn’t really mean anything.  They prepared more for playoff basketball this year and learned a defense that switches everything.  They’re playing different basketball from last year."
tyler herro
tyler herro
Imagine if Tyler herro had been playing for a contract in the bubble
“RJ Barrett is better than Tyler Herro”
"""Bucks fan here coming in peace. I just wanted to say GG's and great series! I know we swept you guys and blew you the fuck out the last 3 games but you guys sure made it tough! At least you guys have last year! ;)  By the way  Jimmy Butler is a DOG! He plays with HEART and GRIT! He's the kind of player I wouldn't mind having on my team! Tyler Herro is a future star FO SHO! Keep your chins up there's always next year!"""
"Grayson ""Tyler Herro"" Allen"
So is Grayson Allen better than Tyler Herro technically ?
Or that Tyler Herro is untouchable in a Harden trade
Did Tyler herro make that stupid lip face again!? He fucked up
Tyler Herro played?
Def not Tyler herro
Not trading Tyler herro for Kyle Lowry 😂😂😂
mo bamba and tyler herro biggest examples is there anyone else?
Tyler “Not A” Herro
"This a lyric from the song ""Tyler Herro"""
"any of you guys even listen to the clip? Shaq literally says ""What he say Kenny"" and then he says what Tyler Herro said about Luka and Trae lmao"
"Bucks should trade those two washed up scrubs for Herro, send the Greek Freak down south to become the Heat Freak, so Tyler can become the Milwaukee Herro, the Hero they need to finally get them a ring."
Kuzma dreams of being Tyler Herro.
"Yeah Tyler Herro can come up in the best young players conversation right after Luka, Trae, Tatum, Brown, Zion, Booker, Edwards, Mitchell, Ja, Fox, Jamal, KAT, Ayton, MPJ, Bam, Ingram, Sabonis, SGA, LaMelo, Collins, Sexton, Dejounte, etc"
No you absolutely do not need to put Tyler Herro in the same convo as Trae and Luka even if Herro had a great game   Kenny is on crack
Can’t deal with hypotheticals. If I remember correctly we lost to the hawks who were missing like all their players. Only person really injured was Tyler Herro. Jimmy was good to go.
Tyler Herro as good as Luka? Shaq off one too
Everybody wanna say sorry for all that Tyler Herro disrespect over the last few months?
also Jimmy Butler gave his top shelf coffee to Tyler Herro
Is Tyler Herro better than Luka?
The Tyler Herro haters real quiet tonight.  Dude’s the real deal. We knew this. Had a 3 week break for his first “offseason” and people roasted him cuz he didn’t improve from Rookie to Sophomore season.  ITS HERRO SEASON BABY

Tyler Herro already in NBA Finals form 😤😤😤
Tyler Herro MIP?
"The following statement was released today by Tyler Herro through his personal attorney and business manager, Jack Harlow, in response to questions about his future career plans.  “I’m back”"
Tyler Herro should have been on NBA’s top 75
&gt;even if they don't have an MVP caliber player.   and Tyler Herro took this personally.
"For real I forgot about them but adding Kyle Lowry, plus Tyler Herro with a chip on his shoulder after a subpar last season. They’re gonna be guuud"
Tyler “regular season and one or two postseason games a year” Herro is undefeated
I was on a thread getting trash a few weeks ago for saying there is no way u can rank KPJ over Herro for 2019 draft guards...KPJ has been as mediocre as he always is since and Tyler has been on a tear.
Tyler Herro hates Greece

"Yeah, that's because Tyler Herro isn’t from the same universe as you motherfuckers. He’s a REAL motherfucker. He’s got liquid fucking hydrogen running through his veins. My boy Tyler recognize the great steal by Jimmy, recognizes the greatness of Jimmy but fuck that. My boy Tyler isn’t going to just pass the ball up like a BITCH. RAF MOTHERFUCKING TYLER IS GOING TO LOOK AT HIS DEFENDER IN THE EYES AND SNATCH THEIR BALLS FROM THEIR DICK AS HE FUCKS THE SKY. FUCK OUTTA HERE PHILLY. Imagine having a great young prospect that CANT shoot lmfao couldn’t be me."
Tyler herro is going to be an all star this year.
Tyler herro is going to be an all star this year.

"Awards:      MVP: Steph Curry      Finalists:      Giannis Antetokounmpo      Nikola Jokic        I predict the top 3 seeds in the West will be the Jazz, Suns and the Warriors. Out of those 3, Steph is by far the best player and MVP candidate. If I'm being honest, Giannis and Steph are tied, and I have Steph above from bias. Both have fantastic narratives but that favours Steph, both can have fantastic seeds but that favours Giannis, both will have elite MVP stats, both will have voter fatigue but Giannis moreso, and I think Steph will go harder in the regular season. Jokic 3rd because like why not, he has a bit of everything, Trae probably 4th.        DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo      Finalists:      Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert      Rudy won't win it again. Simple as that. Not for atleast a few seasons. Draymond 2nd because of the seeding leap the Warriors can take. I think Giannis's focus will be more on offball offense and defense this year as the Bucks have focused on getting offensive upgrades this offseason.        ROTY: Cade Cunningham      Finalists:      Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes         Cade will have the best impact metrics because of how he will get the keys to Detroit and that's it. Detroit is Cades team already and that'll decide it. Barnes playmaking and defense already looks nice and Green is just too flashy and his scoring is super impressive at his age, they'll be top 3.  &amp;#x200B;     6th Man: Tyler Herro      Finalists:      Kevin Huerter      Dennis Schroeder  &amp;#x200B;  After his sophomore slump, I can see Herro taking a leap. His team will take a leap and he'll pair fantastically with Lowry. There isn't really any strong 6th man favourites to me, so I just threw in Huerter and Schroeder who's teams will be better this year.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Most Improved: Jordan Poole      Finalists:      Bam Adebayo      OG Anunoby       Jordan Poole has taken quite a leap once again, and his increased role will lead to a big stats leap. He's flashy and more importantly, the media is already acknowledging him. That's a key factor. Jokic became the MVP favourite because everyone just acknowledged it halfway through the season, I think it'll be a similar thing with Poole. Bam had a nice looking midrange last season that was gone during the playoffs, but with the addition of Lowry, I can see him not only taking an individual leap, but taking a statistical leap twice over due to Lowry. OG looks like his offensive arsenal has expanded massively, and while I don't know too much about him, I know he's one of the top MIP candidates/  &amp;#x200B;  COTY: Steve Kerr      Finalists:      Monty Williams      Mike Malone  Draymond, Steph and Poole are all high on these awards and Warriors will take a massive leap, easy.  &amp;#x200B;  EOTY: Marc Eversley      Finalists:      Bob Myers      Andy Elisburg  Just guys who made unexpected leaps in the seeding as GMs"
MVP: Steph  DPOY: Giannis  ROTY: Jalen Green  6MOY: Tyler Herro  MIP: Jordan Poole  COTY: Steve Kerr
"MVP: Kevin Durant  DPOY: Draymond Green  ROY: Josh Giddey  6MOY: Tyler Herro  MIP: Jordan Poole  COY: Chris Finch  I don't think Poole is going to get 6MOY because he's probably gonna start for half of the season with Klay out, and still might start after he comes back depending on what he does this year"
"But maybe Lillard asks to be traded to a competitive team and not a rebuilding team in that case. It would be a very bad PR move for the Blazers not to follow Lillard's wishes. Not many ""competitive teams"" have young talented players they want to trade away along with picks for the the next decade (remember ""Tyler Herro for James Harden""? Or... ""Ben Simmons for James Harden""? lol). This could help the Sixers even if Simmons' value dropped."
*AFTER FUTURE FIRST BALLOT HOFER TYLER HERRO
"I mean culture is part of the development process and winning. Having one already established is just gonna help the team out tremendously.  It’s why guys like Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson and Bam have been so good on the heat cause they went to a team that had a culture of hard work and winning in mind. It helps with development to have that beforehand. It’s why the Raptors and Denver have been great at developing young guys meanwhile the Pistons, Kings, Minnesota and other purgatory teams have struggled due to having no identity and culture.  It’s why those early process teams were so bad cause they didn’t care about building their guys up then and just seen them as assets to be traded. Aint no way they had all them picks and only 1.5 of them have truly worked out (Simmons being the .5)."
Tyler Herro is going to be leaned on for so much bench scoring. Seems like a good bet.
"I'm not even saying I think we're incredibly good, I'd argue we have produced more starter caliber players over the last say 5 years, but not trying to big us up too much.  I'm just saying I don't really see the heat that way. Herro and Nunn are both really solid but are only entering their 3rd years, I think Tyler Johnson is fine, Max Strus is not even close to a success story yet, Wayne Ellington is not a Heat Development success, he was a vet that upped his PPG .7 with the Heat and Hassan Whiteside has almost played himself out of the league cause hes the definition of an empty stats centre.  Bam, Robinson and maybe Herro/Nunn (lets see how this year goes) are players you can hang your hat on developing but I'd argue your org is best known for having veteran players buy into coaching and system, not finding coal and shaping them into diamonds.  While we're not supernatural I'd stack FVV, OG, Siakam &amp; Norm Powell against any players developed by the Heat."
Tyler Johnson/Kendrick Nunn/Duncan Robinson/Tyler Herro/Bam Adebayo/Hassan Whiteside/Max Struss/Wayne Ellington. All these guys are good or had career years with the Heat. Raptor fans are either bitter or ignorant. Either way I don’t care. Super excited for next season.
"Heat are going to go to the finals again:  1. They have one of the deepest teams  2. Tyler Herro is going to cook bench units alive  3. Kyle Lowry will bring much needed play making.  4. Bam should have taken a huge step forward.  5. Overall, they have no major weaknesses and can match up with anyone in the East."
Tyler Herro certainly imagines max money.
"Thanks for doing tiers, way better. I'll do it too.   (Assuming Kyrie won't play, Kawhi and Murray are back to normal come playoffs)  (Tier 1-3 are in order inside the tiers, 4 is lightly ordered and 5 is just a list as it's meaningless.)  &amp;#x200B;  ***Team Power Rankings:***  ***Tier 1: Favourites***  Nets, Bucks, Lakers  &amp;#x200B;  ***Tier 2: Top Contenders***  Clippers, Suns, Nuggets, Heat, Warriors, Hawks  &amp;#x200B;  ***Tier 3: Strong Playoff Teams***  Jazz, Celtics, Sixers, Blazers, Bulls, Mavs, Knicks  &amp;#x200B;  ***Tier 4: Low Tier Potential Playoff Teams***  Wolves, Pelicans, Wizards, Spurs, Kings, Pacers, Hornets  &amp;#x200B;  ***Tier 5: Tanking Teams***  Rockets, Thunder, Magic, Pistons, Raptors, Cavs  &amp;#x200B;  ***MVP:*** Steph Curry      *Finalists:*   Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic        ***DPOY:*** Giannis Antetokounmpo      *Finalists:*   Draymond Green      Rudy Gobert        ***ROTY:*** Cade Cunningham      *Finalists:*   Jalen Green      Scottie Barnes        ***6th Man:*** Tyler Herro      *Finalists:*   Kevin Huerter      Patty Mills        ***Most Improved:*** Jordan Poole      *Finalists:*   OG Anunoby      Kevin Porter Jr        ***COTY:*** Steve Kerr      *Finalists:*   Monty Williams      Mike Malone"
"You’re absolutely right, what Ayton showed last playoffs gets young guys maxed nowadays. Only thing is, teams want a bigger sample size than literally 1 playoff run. Imagine Tyler Herro after 2020 playoffs getting maxed only to come out the next season without any improvements."
More like what Tyler Herro thinks he is
"And what success have they seen besides the Kawhi led Raptors? Look I think both are evenly good, but the Heat has shown success. We turned Whiteside into a max contract player. We turned guys like Tyler Johnson into high salary guys. It’s super revisionist to just look at the last 2-3 years and say the Heat aren’t as good as the Raptors at developing. Btw we have Duncan/Bam/Herro/Struss who have been very good for us just in the pst 3 years. I don’t need to go back decades and state every player."
"I personally think the Heat weren’t seriously in the running for Harden (not enough picks, young prospects other than Achiewa to make a competitive trade package), but if Tyler Herro *was* the centerpiece of that deal, I would have personally packed his bags and drove him to MIA."
This is almost equivalent to the Should Miami give up Tyler Herro for Harden “debate”

"This is why the ‘it’s a personal decision’ thing, even from people like KAT who strongly support the vaccine, is so frustrating.  Like, no, it’s not.  It’s a decision to help the greater society.  Why does everything have to be about yourself?  I think Tyler Herro actually had the best take on why the vaccine is so important."
"The hell are you talking about? I like Trae and I think he'll be just as good with these rule changes/enforcements. Are you really stupid enough to think a preseason game against a g-league level lineup is evidence of this, though?  Tyler Herro is top 5 in PPG this preseason. Do you think he'll be top 5 for the rest of the season?  I have to say the only bad thing about being a fan of Trae is that rabid stans. will interpret anything as slander, and attack your flair instead of your opinion. It's like Twitter KPOP stans lol"

"Smart man Tyler Herro.  first reaction was to retaliate for his teammate, second reaction was ""nah fuck that I enjoy all my teeth, I have an insta to think about"""
I like Jokic even more now.  Also Tyler Herro would die. lmao
You seem like the type of guy who owns a Tyler Herro jersey
"I like how Tyler Herro did a quick step towards Jokic like he was gonna do something then just promptly did nothing.  Jokes aside. Lots of people laughing about ""fake tough guys in the league"", but this is what these guys do for a living and have worked for all their lives. They also have to consider the ""business"" decision. People learned from the Malice at the Palace on how one mistake can derail your season or even career."
"The best is Tyler herro taking one step.and then walking away, don't blame him one bit that's a sound business decision lol"
Tyler Herro has still gone to more finals then your whole organization so we not to worried about it 🥱
Lol Tyler Herro turning around like he's gonna do something
"I know this is a serious thing but the 1.5 seconds where Tyler Herro thinks about squaring up with Jokic and then decides that might not be a sound strategy have me rolling.  “What the f….oh no this referee is slightly in my way, you’re lucky.”"
"1. Fuck Morris. 2.Not a smart play by Joker, but I 100% understand why he did that.  3.LMAO WHAT DID TYLER HERRO THINK HE WAS GONNA DO?"
"Tyler Herro saw it, ran up to Joker to defend his teammate, and then quickly came to his senses and noped the fuck out of there lmao"
Tyler herro is like.... uh good game big fella. Ima get a gatorade.
"Couldn't have happened to a nicer fella!   Big old school energy from Jokic. He's not going to be bullied. If you watch the more extended replays and reaction, Tyler Herro walks over for a split second and sizes up Jokic before deciding to nope the fuck out of there."
Damn Tyler Herro was ready to throw tf down!
Tyler Herro took one look at Jokic and thought better.
"Unrelated fun stat I just noticed during the game:  Tyler Herro averages more FGA per game than LaMelo Ball, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, Karl-Anthony Towns, Fred VanVleet, Jordan Clarkson, Joel Embiid, and James Harden."
last year our offense was jimmy isos and bam handoffs. that’s pretty much it. now we have kyle running the playmaking and really getting everyone involved making jimmy and bam much more potent on offense and defense. plus tyler herro is outscoring the opp bench on his own pretty efficiently. amazing defense combined with solid offense
&gt;Tyler Herro playing super well.  I still don't understand why this is so surprising to people. He showed glimpses of being a star his rookie year. Then he averaged better numbers his sophomore season but dealt with injury issues and had virtually no offseason. And now with a proper off season he is playing really well. I know he got a lot of hype from the shit he did in the 2020 playoffs but it seems like a bit of a meme that he wasn't a good player.
"Last season, they were struggling to find some groove due to fatigue, coming from a short rest after the NBA Bubble run they had.  This season, they got KLow who is a proven floor general and solid contributor. PJ Tucker added further toughness on them and dog mentality. Not to mention, they are truly motivated to bounce back after being annihilated by the Bucks via sweep. The early rest they received is a blessing in disguise to set that goal for a season of redemption, and Tyler Herro is the proof of that."
Tyler Herro averaging an efficient 21 PPG  helps
Tyler Herro

"It's the LeBron haters trying to talk down the 2020's ring by diminishing what Miami accomplished and they point to 2021's performance as ""evidence"".   Tyler Herro is killing it this year and LeBron still looks as great as ever."
&gt;now they’ll have to apologize to Tyler Herro  I would prefer not to
Pat Riley refused to trade Tyler Herro for James Harden
"boiling hot garbage take right there. his defense is down because his offensive load is up, def doesnt suck. tyler herro can tell you that."
"Yeah they were really kicking the heat while they were down. And no amount of “were injured and coming off of the shortest off season in history” could stop the slander. Oh well, now they’ll have to apologize to Tyler herro"
Demar Derozan's season so far.  Tyler Herro playing super well.  Sixers at the top of the East.  Cavs are shining right now too which is huge to me.  GSW at the top of the West.
"Miles Bridges, Tyler Herro (didn't expect him to be this good)  Gary Trent Jr as well, look better on defense.  Many star players arent playing as well as I thought except KD, Jokic and Giannis.  GPII, OPJ and Bjelica looks really good in Warriors system.  Team wise: Warriors and Wizards surpassed expectstions"
But all murrays stats are higher!!!  Also if you didnt hear Tyler herro is better than Dbook and Trae.
That's silly.  Nobody is guarnateed to improve in the NBA year to year because progression isn't linear.  Ask Tyler Herro.  Sophomore slumps are very common.
&gt;	Yeah Tyler Herro is gonna be Harden  Never said anything remotely close to that. Learn to read next time before trying to write.
"Yeah Tyler Herro is gonna be Harden but Harden is not an all time great offensively, you’re right. Your thought process has led you to the most reasonable outcome.  Enjoy the Timberwolves."
Tyler herro plays like crazy... So maybe him
The Tyler herro disrespect
"Except the Raptors wanted Herro and Robinson for Lowry. Which, while yes still a good trade, Miami did the smart thing by just simply waiting.  https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-kyle-lowry-trade-miami-heat-tyler-herro-duncan-robinson-offer  Side note, imagine if Carmelo did this instead. I mean with the Knicks."
Breaking: Tyler Herro emerges as self proclaimed 6th man of the year after military coup
"I hope so, for his sake, as much as the team’s. It’s a hard label to shake for any player.  [Seems like he has been in the past](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/10001023-tyler-herro-talks-bench-role-with-heat-definitely-thought-i-would-be-starting.amp.html), so that’s good.  I also think there are some players who really benefit from reps off the bench for their longterm development."
Miles Bridges or Tyler Herro
"Plenty of people valued Mobley higher before the draft. It just so happened that Detroit's GM wasn't one of those people.   People want player evaluations to be simple and linear, but they're not. People are on different growth curves. Sometimes players look really bad for a while and then get good. Sometimes vice versa. We won't know who is really the best player until they've all turned into whomever they're going to turn in to.   I mean, look at Tyler Herro. Two years ago: ""great young player, could be the centerpiece of a trade for Harden."" Last year: ""The bubble was a fluke. He's smoke and mirrors. Not that good."" This year: ""Okay, I guess the bubble wasn't a fluke."" Happens with non-star players, too. Harrison Barnes looked competent as a rookie, and looked like somebody who wouldn't get a second NBA contract in his second year. He was then the #3 guy in minutes on a team that dominated the league for two years.   Let's roll back into the time machine. It's clear that Steph Curry is the best player from the 2009 draft. My question for you is: in what year did that become a reasonable position to hold? Tyreke Evans won ROY (although at the time I felt, as a totally biased Warrior fan, that Steph was clearly better). But even Warrior fans who were super high on him at the time weren't ranking him over Blake in 2012 or 2013. In 2015, there were a lot of people arguing that Harden deserved the MVP (it was fairly pointed when the players award went to Harden).   It probably wasn't until 2016 and his SECOND MVP that people recognized that he was the best player from that draft. Seven years later. But even still there were some people who weren't converted until last year when they saw that he could put up monster numbers carrying a team.   So you want to make the definitive ranking of guys from this draft before they've played 10 games?   Slow down and enjoy the ride."

"“Tyler herro thinks he can win 6MOTY, an award luka and trae have never won. What does this say about how he views himself?”"
"“Shoutout to everyone doubting me.” - Tyler Herro  I commend him on his confidence. You have to have it to execute on the stage he’s on. Riley said in his pre-season presser something to the effect of “don’t say it, show me.” Not directly to Tyler, but a general observation. I think because of his looks and swagger (and his comments, which can be taken out of context, like anyone’s can), he gets a lot of attention / hate.  I love that he loves taking big shots in big moments. We saw it from his rookie year. He just has to continue to let his play do the talking. He’s got a bright future and many more levels to him."

"You already know baby!! Tyler Herro scores 29 tho and all you see is his ass on the front page of this sub. Jokic, Luka and Herro get a lot of play on this sub, I hope none of them win anything because their fans are so obnoxious."
"Uh, who is saying Luka is in convo for best player?  Tyler Herro literally played HORSE with him in our game against the Mavs, taking Luka's exact shots that he takes and misses on him in the immediate next play repeatedly, drained all of them, and Luka didn't do anything at all to our defense despite being freely allowed to hunt mismatches.  I'm not saying Mavs improve in a 1 for 1 trade or anything, but let me just say Luka did absolutely nothing to prove Tyler Herro's point wrong since he made the point and Tyler has done everything to prove his point right."
What's your excuse for posting too many james charles/tyler herro memes?  They don't look alike dude.
Tyler Herro &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ben Simmons.
"* Bam rebound, gives it to Lowry. Lowry brings it up court, passes to Butler at the elbow, Butler takes 1 dribble and passes it to Tyler Herro who misses a three. Ball gets tipped to Bam who gets fouled. * Butler inbounds to Morris, who passes it back to Butler. Butler passes it to Herro at the free throw line who shoots a floater. * Morris rebounds, passes it to Herro (instead of Butler) to bring the ball up the court. Herro tosses it into Bam in the post. Bam throws a pass that gets deflected to Morris, Morris to Lowry, Lowry to Herro in the corner, Herro to Jimmy in the post, Jimmy to a cutting Lowry, who gets two free throws. * Lowry inbounds to Herro. Herro dribbles around until he shoots and makes a shot from the elbow.  * Lowry turns it over on the inbounds pass. * Ball inbounded to Herro (off camera). Herro turns it over with a travel. * Martin inbounds to Lowry. Lowry to Butler in the corner. Butler to Bam in the high post. Bam to Martin who misses contested three. * Inbounded to Lowry. Lowry and Bam pick and pop, Lowry passes to Bam who misses a free throw line jumper.  * Herro inbounds to Butler. Butler turns it over driving to the bakset. * Inbounded to Butler. Butler drives to the basket, passes to Caleb Martin who misses a wide open layup. * Inbounded to Butler. Butler drives and gets a blocking foul and gets free throws. * Inbounded to Bam who brings it up court. Passes to Lowry. Lowry to Butler at the top of the key. Butler drives and hits an elbow jumper.  * Inbounded to Butler. Passed to Herro. Herro dribbles and passes it back to Butler. Butler is stripped by Conley on the drive (should have been called a reach-in foul) and it ricochets off him when Mitchell throws it back inbounds.  * Inbounded to Herro, intentionally fouled for free throws. * Inbounded to Butler, intentionally fouled. * Rebounded by Lowry, passed ahead to Butler who has a wide open dunk but evades the defense to run out the clock.  So you found the following actions by Jimmy down the stretch to be problematic: a potential assist to Herro for a wide open three, an assist to Herro, a free throw assist to Lowry, a bad driving turnover, a potential assist to Martin for a wide open layup, free throws off a blocking foul, making an elbow jumper, a turnover by a bad no-call from the ref, intentional foul free throws, and passing open a wide open dunk to run out the clock."
He decided to take over and not let Tyler or Lowry touch the ball who built the lead while he was on the bench. Tyler had 13 points in the quarter and was hot not getting him the ball is dumb. This only helped the Jazz comeback because jimmy isn’t as good of a playmaker as Lowry and Herro so our offense became stagnant. I’ve never seen anyone take over and have the other team continue to cut into the lead as their taking over.
"Luka is in the convo for best player in the league mate, Herro is in the 6moty convo.  And Ja and Trae are the best players in their teams, making it an unfair comparison because Tyler is the 3rd ball handler of the team."
Tyler Herro is a star.
What does Jimmy have to do with that? From when Butler checked into the game with 6:47 left:  * 6:32 - Tyler Herro missed 3PT Shot * 6:24 - Tyler Herro floating jumper * 5:55 - Kyle Lowry Free Throws * 5:20 - Tyler Herro jump shot * 4:53 - Kyle Lowry turnover * 4:18 - Tyler Herro turnover * 3:38 - Caleb Martin missed 3PT Shot * 3:13 - Bam Adebayo missed shot * 2:44 - Jimmy Butler turnover * 2:13 - Caleb Martin missed layup. * 1:47 - Jimmy Butler free throws * 1:11 - Jimmy Butler jumpshot * 42.9 - Jimmy Butler turnover * 17.6 - Tyler Herro free throws * 10.4 - Jimmy Butler free throws  Jimmy was in the game almost 4 minutes before he had a possession finishing action. A big problem with Miami down the stretch was that the offense wasn't funneling through Butler for large stretches of the 4th until he decided to take control of the situation once the lead shrunk very small.
Is Tyler Herro good enough to be in the same sentence as Trae and Luka?
"Of all the things about the NBA, probably my least favorite is how refs seem to take pity on smaller players and let them play by different rules. If Tyler Herro bear hugs Rudy Gobert on a roll, it should still be a foul despite Rudy being a foot taller.  That being said Rudy needs to do a better job of not letting no-calls affect him mentally. It’s been a recurring trend that a few bad calls and he gets frustrated and plays poorly. Not a great showing from him tonight."
Tyler Herro is for real
Goatee Tyler Herro is the 6MOY we deserve
This is a roundabout way of praising Tyler Herro and I'm all for it
Tyler “Duncan Robinson” Herro
The biggest issue is he doesn’t flop let’s be real; Tyler Herro is the same way. He gets fouled a ton but because he doesn’t embellish they contact the ref let play continue. During the magic game every singe time Tyler drove to the rim the defender would their arm into his rib and push him away from the basket. Props to the magic defenders who saw the refs not calling it and continued to do it.
tyler herro running away with 6moy rn
"tyler herro, rj barrett"
It's Tyler Herro for me if he keeps up his current production.
Tyler Herro or Alex Caruso
Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro is better
This is a fresh take. I don't count out Tyler Herro or the Warriors core getting injured at the worst moment ever tho.
"Jimmy Butler doesn't have to shoot 3s because he's surrounded by Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson and Kyle Lowry. The team built a system around Jimmy Butler's strengths and weaknesses and are successful because of it.   If you put Jimmy Butler back on the 76ers, they probably wouldn't be as good even though Embiid and Simmons are probably more talented than anybody on the Heat."
"I fourth this, fuck Tyler Herro"
My bala Patty Mills and Tyler Herro get my votes
Tyler Herro -32
He won't win it cause he wasn't terrible before hand. Tyler herro legit had a down year last year so if he keeps this up he's a lock
Tyler Herro with a solid -32 +/-
Tyler Herro with a solid -32 +/-
Tyler Herro +/-  - 32 lmao dumbasses callin him mip
I like the Heat but man do I hate Tyler Herro.
"Good thing you guys got the same amount of wins tonight, oh ya...Fuck Tyler herro"
"Third, fuck Tyler Herro"
Tyler herro -32….yikes
"I second this, fuck tyler herro"
Nice win also fuck Tyler Herro
Hi I just arrived tell me how to overreact does Tyler Herro suck again?
Tonight! Jayson Tatum and Tyler Herro recreate the Clippers in game 7 in the bubble!
Romeo Langford 3-5 10 pts +27  Tyler Herro 0-4 4 pts -32
Tyler Herro is at -29 and the next lowest +/- is -11 lmao.
"Tyler Herro after he torches the Celtics and our fanbase is pissed ""the ones that hate me the most look just like me"""
"So RAPTOR is a team based system? How are you gonna judge a players defense by how good their team is. Like my team is the Miami Heat and we have a top 3 defense, doesn’t mean Tyler Herro is top defender and his plus minus is leading the team btw. I remember in the finals against the Cavs the Cavs kept switching on to Curry as their strategy and you know the rest. No hate just doesn’t make sense."
"Yes it does. Do you guys think if you had LaMelo instead, you guys would be so quick to include him in all these trade packages?  Look at any fanbase with a blossoming young player like Tyler Herro or a Scottie Barnes, etc they rarely want to include these players even if it meant getting a proven stud."
&gt;#####A new season means new players stepping to the forefront. Here are a handful who look like they could make a leap two weeks into 2021-22.  --- Included players:  &gt;* Miles Bridges {CHA} * Ja Morant {MEM} * Tyler Herro {MIA} * OG Anunoby {TOR} * Cole Anthony {ORL} * Harrison Barnes {SAC} * Desmond Bane {MEM} * Jakob Poeltl {SAS} * Cam Reddish {ATL} * Mo Bamba {ORL}
"Jordan Poole, Tyler Herro, Harrrison Barnes averaging 25 and 10"
I got Top 3.   Miles Bridges   Tyler Herro   Jonas Valencunis   Harrison Barnes nd Lonzo Next Up
- Harrison Barnes has increased his PPG by 7pts from last year  - Tyler Herro has increased his PPG by 7pts from last year  - Miles Bridges has increased his PPG by **12pts** from last year  These are some of the largest jumps in terms of PPG over last year. So I'd give it to Miles Bridges.
1. Miles Bridges   2. Dejounte Murray   3. Tyler Herro   4. Jordan Poole   5. OG Anunoby  HM: Ja but will be hard bc he’s already established
"Miles Bridges, Harrison Barnes, Tyler Herro  Maybe OG, but his stats haven’t overly recovered from his first two games"
All-nba and all defensive team is way different. Matisse is still just a role player and less valuable than even Tyler herro. Let's not forget Matisse had the game tying foul and missed free throw in game seven.
"Our offense is surprisingly good. I knew Lowry would help a lot but I didn’t expect transition buckets like this and definitely Tyler Herro breaking out.. Herro be off the dribble shits, hitting step back, fadeaway, flying around off ball , running PnR doing it all."
Let's give some first fortnight awards.  * MVP of the first two weeks - Jimmy Butler * DP of the first two weeks - Jimmy Butler * 6M of the first two weeks - Tyler Herro * MIP of the first two weeks - Tyler Herro * RO the first two weeks - Scottie Barnes who's from West Palm Beach and probably was a Heat fan as a kid * CO the first two weeks - Eric Spoelstra * EO the first two weeks - Pat Riley * Teammate of the first two weeks - Kyle Lowry
"How about some dark horses? I think if Miami makes first seed by that point, Tyler Herro has a chance to squeak in as a potential alternate."
WB for Tyler Herro
"I thought Tyler Herro was going to get sucked into Miami celebrity life and slowly decline into obscurity. I am happy to report that he is one of those ""train every day"" guys and I couldn't have been more wrong about him. Get it boiii"
Tyler Herro was a punchline on here all last season to the point you couldn't even really discuss his play because the haters were so rabid and now most people have flipped completely and consider him a 6MOY candidate.
Tyler Herro should be in the convo too
I have a new conversation: Which one has a cuter smile? Ja Morany or Tyler Herro
Then Tyler Herro hides the glizzy in his shorts and pops him
Tyler herro
Tyler Herro is officially in the same conversation as Ja Morant
Jimmy Butler gave Tyler Herro depression

"This reminds me of the time when this happened during a Sixers game the year Jimmy Butler was there. Butler got a steal and the ball boy was mopping up sweat and couldn’t get out of the way, so Butler used the ball boy to set a pick on Marcus Smart and then passed it to Simmons for the easy dunk. Butler was impressed by the ballboy’s intangibles on offense and recruited him to come to Miami. That ball boy’s name? Tyler Herro."

Stephen A SHOCKED by Tyler Herro miracle shot
Probably literally that Tyler Herro song
All I saw on my social feeds was some stupid tyler herro passing it through the bucket from half court over and over.   This play was genuinely one of the most amazing things I've seen in an nba game in years. I went back in the live game like 6 times because I couldn't even make sense of how he did it.
is it just me or did the players all seems bigger and more jacked back then...I'm watching robinson and Rodman then I look over and I see Jalen Green and Tyler Herro skinny ass. I know they're younger tho but Robinson makes AD look like a baby. Just imagine most of the players on the court are Embiid sized
TYLER HERRO BALLING OUT FOR 3 MINUTES AND 15 SECONDS STRAIGHT
"Nope it's not Ashton Kutcher, it's Tyler Herro"
[TYLER HERRO IS THE NEXT MANU CONFIRMED](https://youtu.be/McsswoHgA6Y)
Jimmy Butler is a very fine player of the basketball and a modern day sex symbol. He is the perfect role model to help Tyler Herro learn how to become a very fine player of the basketball and a future sex symbol.
'Tyler Herro'
"Yes, with Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro going for a combined 100 to mark the greatest comeback ever for a team in the NBA since the last Pels game..."
I read Tyler Herro masturbation
"Tyler ""Russell Westbrook"" Herro"
"Well yea… this Harden is not good. He’s averaging (checks notes) 20 ppg, 9 asg. I mean that’s only good enough for 3rd in the league. That’s not even an efficient 20 ppg, he’s only shooting (checks notes) 39% from 3 with 7.5 attempts. Plus he only scored *24 pts* last night… why even show up. Man this guys is totally washed. They should trade for Ben Simmons or Tyler Herro."
"That's because Butler is injured no way they double Herro is Both Bam and Jimmy are on floor , also since Tyler play 30+ minutes they all share the floor more often than not"
"Tyler Herro is actually a great rebounder for his position, has been since day 1. Even with those short little arms he knows how to use his body to sheild the ball really well"

Tyler “I belong in the same conversation as Luka and Trae” Herro
"Tyler ""Mr. Steal Yo Rebound"" Herro"
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
"Do you still think Barrett is better than Herro? Tyler been in the starting lineup playing against starters and played very well against some good teams. It’s ok to be wrong but I’ll check back at season end, lol"
I believe you meant to spell lose.  But I’m actually proud of the leap he has made this year. I still don’t think he’s better than those players but you can definitely put his name beside them.  Also my most recent post on Reddit is a Tyler Herro 3 pointer just before quarter 1 ended.

This man ain’t gonna get love for a while, it’s all about Ice Trae and Luka Magic rn"
Him and Tyler Herro should be the all star starters ⭐🔥
Even if we never win with Jimmy if we can hold on to Bam and Herro for a long time we’re going to be in absolute great hands. Tyler being put in positions to lead the team now is going to be great for his development.
Before the season Tyler Herro said put some respect on his name and this sub called him delusional. Put some respect on that mans name

"MIP or 6th man award but Tyler Herro is leaving with something, lol"
"Jokic although clearly one of the most talented and playing phenomenal ball right now will never get any recognition because he isn’t marketable.

"Tyler ""Don't Call Me ""Tyler ""Luka Doncic"" Herro"" Herro""."
Tyler “Luka “Trae Young” Doncic” Herro
TYLER HERRO
"I think the song being named after him is sort of a symptom rather than a cause but I see what you’re saying. I would say someone like Jordan Clarkson (also spent time in a massive market) kills guys off the bench, is a microwave scorer, but doesn’t have people fawning over him in the same way that Tyler does. He is still well known, but the media attention isn’t there.   It’s hard to quantify this stuff because there is no control group: in order to have irrefutable proof, we would need to compare against a universe where Tyler Herro is black. But the next best thing we can do is observe how our culture discusses white and black players.  Tyler, Luka, Jokic, even Caruso. In my observation, there is extra hype around them (even if they are generationally talented) compared to some of their black counterparts."
"Is it crazy to think that a society that favors white men might favor white athletes?  If you want a good example, look no further than Tyler Herro. But people aren’t really interested in a good faith discussion about this."
- Gary Trent Jr  - LaMelo Ball  - Evan Mobley  - Montrezl Harrell  - Cole Anthony  - Richuan Holmes   - Grayson Allen  - Tyler Herro   - Dejounte Murray  - Jonas Valanciunas
"I obviously understand the argument here that it was a bad idea to trade Harden to save $4mil, but did anyone at the time really think he was going to be a league MVP and all-time great? I was only in high school when the trade happened so I didn’t quite have the NBA knowledge I have now, but sounds like it would be the present-day equivalent of trading Tyler Herro for draft picks and cap relief. Yeah, almost definitely a bad idea, but how many people are expecting Tyler Herro to win an MVP?"
"So Player B, you definitely always take Tyler Herro over Kobe."
I mean on pure accounting stats alone I would take the Tyler Herro season (I have no idea who it’s being compared to tho)
player A is kobe bryant  player b is tyler herro  checkmate libsharts
Moving forward I'd probably say Coby. Sounds like they're going to throw him into a Jordan Clarkson/Tyler Herro role.   White's a known product at this point and I think he is what he is.
So Tyler Herro is now white chocolate

Tyler Herro is a jumpshooter
"I think it's a 3 guard, small ball unit with;  Jalen Brunson Tyler Herro Alex Caruso Cam Reddish Precious Achiuwa (now that he's coming off the bench)   Most of these guys could start on many teams and have shown that. They also play as closers frequently.   As a Spurs fan I had to stop myself from putting Devin Vassell in there for either Brunson or Caruso (although he might play his way in soon at this rate)."
I don’t think I’ve ever fucking seen Kyle Lowry or Tyler Herro miss a shot. Ever.
"Honestly I'd still put Tyler herro above Murray. But herro won't win it cause he'll win 6moy. Right now Miles and Ja are the undisputed front runners, then there a gap."
This is James Harden and Tyler Herro all over again
"Tyler Herro: 15/5/3 on 54% TS to 21/5/4 on 56%TS  Og Anunoby: 16/5/2 on 61%TS to 20/6/3 on 52%TS (Not really an improvement)  Dejounte Murray: 16/7/5 on 51%TS to 18/8/8 on 50% TS  Jordan Poole: 12/2/2 on 58%TS to 18/3/3 on 55%TS  Ja Morant: 19/4/7 on 54%TS to 27/6/7 on 57%TS   Miles Bridges: 13/6/2 on 63%TS to 22/7/4 on 55%TS (Significant efficiency drop)  &amp;#x200B;  Really just do not understand how anyone can be writing off Ja for this award. He has the biggest scoring jump (outside of Bridges) and other than Herro, is the only other candidate who has improve his efficiency while doing so. Considering how hugely different the counting stats are, I still give an edge to Miles Bridges, but Ja is second to me, with Herro and Poole right there."
Tyler Herro? 😱
"Expect it at this point. Someone who really shouldn't pops off for 20-30 on us. (See Jalen Brunson, Doug McDermott, rookie season Tyler Herro, Jeff Green, Mo Wagner, etc)."
Yeah show UD attempting to catch that lob from Tyler Herro and stumbling out of bounds like an 80 year old. Embarrassing.
"After watching Tyler Herro hitting the mitts, his boxing coach would be lucky to score nosebleeds"
Everyone is just forgetting about Tyler Herro.
Tyler Herro is a fucking hooper. I was laughing my ass off in disbelief at the shots he was making.
Thank you for letting us have Avery. His defense on Tyler Herro was immense to end the game last night.
It’s cause he’s guarded by Tyler Herro
"I think the more notable addition than Lowry is a really, really good Tyler Herro but continue to bend over backwards for Lowry. I’m not saying he shouldn’t play games. It’s just that at this point in his career he isn’t suited as a starter or one of the top 15 pg’s in the league."

Tyler Herro will retire as a top 5 SG all-time.
Tyler Herro :(
I am starting to think drafting:  &amp;#x200B;  * OJ Mayo over Westbrook   * Rubio over Curry * Wesley Johnson over Paul George * Derek Williams over Kawhi * Shabazz Muhammad over Giannis * Kris Dunn over Jamal Murray * Jarret Culver over Tyler Herro      was a mistake...
"Siakim is 26 and just put up 22, 6 and 3 against a top rated defense. Don't let the bubble and this shortened off-season fool you, he's a great second option and an ok first option plus there not going to have to worry about him leaving for a few years. Lowery will probably take a massive pay cut and toss in like 5 picks (2 first and 3 second) then it's waaay more then what anybody else is offering. I mean who else could give a better trade package? Philly would be stupid to trade a 24 year old Ben Simmons and you guys aren't going to trade Joel so other then those 2 guys, who else you got to offer? And if you really think the Rockets are going to give up James Harden for Tyler Herro instead of Pascal Siakim AND Lower plus picks then your insane."

I think that could be a reasonable take. They could just have an emotional attachment to Tyler Herro. Saying you like Tyler Herro more than Harden doesn't necessarily mean you think Herro is better as a player than Harden

"I think Curry is better but if you said Harden was I wouldn't think that makes you a hater. That's a reasonable take.   Now if you were telling me Tyler Herro is better than Curry, well, yeah I'm going to have to say you're a hater."
Tyler Herro and maybe Duncan Robinson lol
Tyler herro
Kevin Huerter is the white Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro not of drinking age yet and out there balling on New Years Day lol. Not hungover at all
No... A lot of non-point guards score in a very on-ball manner. KD is one such player. Grab the ball at the top of the 3pt line and let him cook. CJ McCollum is another example. Tyler Herro isn't like that. He catches the ball and makes his attack immediately upon the catch or he passes it off. He needs the ball delivered to him in spots he's comfortable playmaking from.
you put tyler herro in a list of best shooting guards in the east lmfao.
"Because there’s a little bit of sport that is exploiting cheese moves. I’m not the best 2K player and I don’t exactly know the in’s and out’s well enough to set up complicated off ball sets. But I can run a Collin Sexton PnR with the occasional kick out to Tyler Herro with some decent 3&amp;D players and win a chip on 2K. Not gonna lie, it’s not the most exciting way to play, but there’s enough variation and enough of a challenge that it takes a bit of problem solving and throws up the odd highlight play that I keep going back.  You’ve got the Harden iso, Steph Curry off ball sets and Lebron’s drive and kick are cheese moves that formed the basis of successful teams offense."
"Way to use a 4 game sample size. Mpj wasn’t as important for the nuggets as Tyler herro was for the heat. Other than dragic, herro was used to generate his own offense more often than not. Mpj was getting catch and shoot 3s from gravity from jokic and Murray. Again I don’t care about size because they play different positions. I don’t think mo bamba is better than Colin sexton because he gets more rebounds. Also completely disregarded the playmaking advantage because it’s embarrassing the disparity in that area. Herro shows high upside as a future playmaker while mpj has shown no signs of being a willing passer. I think the fact herro averaged more minutes is a credit to him and how easily he fits into a system and doesn’t rub coaches or teammates the wrong way. The 30 point games are cool and all in the regular season but in the playoffs herro showed out while mpj was mostly a role player. If you want to say a team can value mpj upside more for his size and scoring then sure but it’s disingenuous to act like herro is not in the conversation as a highly valuable young prospect."
"Mpj averaged 9 points last season and averaged 40% from 3 on extremely low attempts. Herro averaged 13 points shooting 39% from 3 with high attempts. Only reason people hate Tyler herro now is because of the trade talks with him and harden but objectively speaking herro is a fantastic young prospect.  He’s easily a better passer than mpj and I expect that to continue considering his comments during the playoffs. Herro also had a massive 37 point bomb in the ecf, mpj hasn’t shown a performance like that at all. Only reason people downvoting is the herro hate is at an all time high rn because of laker fans and people that think heat fans won’t trade herro for harden straight up which is not what they’re arguing.   Any counterpoints would be appreciated and I don’t really count height as one"
Nobody loves Tyler Herro more than Heat fans.  My god.  Most overrated player in the league
Tyler herro
"&gt;his comments were kind of ridiculous.  The parts about thinking his season were over, and that ""something always happens"" were true enough.  But the idea that Embiid has ever been close to a championship is utter nonsense, nevermind doing so ""every time""  The man is 27 years old, and has played in just over 2/3rds as many playoff wins as Tyler Herro.  10 playoff wins in his career to-date.  Does he not remember getting swept in the first round last year?"
Yeah I actually really like Tyler herro. It was a joke
Wtf cares about Tyler Herro
- If we like the player = Mamba Mentality.  - If we don't like the player = Hero Ball.  - If it's Tyler Herro = Herro Ball.
If I was super petty like a lot of Heat fans were towards RJ I’d point out how Tyler Herro was 1-9 but I’m not so I won’t
"Idk, there are some great AA athletes out there like LeBron James, Blake Griffin, and Tyler Herro, not sure if they'll all be out of the job!  It'll be great to see some more African talent in the league though - tons of untapped potential, same as China and India IMO.  Have a good day!"
https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/heat-tyler-herro-personal-life-report/1jwqtn38y3z8y1sm3sjdq19ii9  Stfu lol search it it’s all over google
"Jordan Poole will be viewed as a better player than Tyler Herro by the end of next year.  He’s going to keep getting better and be a higher scorer.  Ive thought it since the draft  but He got drafted by the best team and system to develop his game/skill set, and that team has pretty damn good leaders to learn from and better your game.    Not even trying to knock Hero, I just think Poole has more potential and he’s starting to realize it."
"I know this year has been disappointing for anyone who liked Tyler Herro, both performance and dedication wise, but c'mon man."
"Valanciunas was 26 when you traded him, very much a refined product entering his prime and ready for a new contract that year. Tyler Herro is 21 years old and under team control for 6 more years."
"Man Dumars is always slept on, nephews on here have ranked Tyler Herro above him lmao, respect to you for shouting him out. Prob best perimeter defender in history, only guy to shut down Jordan"
"I made a video two weeks ago about 4 sophmores I was rooting for. Namely, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brandon Clarke, Tyler Herro, and Naz Reid. My vides  have been getting removed from the team subs for lack of karma but I thought some people in here might enjoy it. Please let me know if you have any comments or criticism.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gPh9UEiFXs"
After last year's playoffs I can't imagine rooting against Tyler Herro.
"and fuck Tyler Herro, too."
Lol. Both are great  I think Donte’s shots will fall soon enough but his defence is what’s been insane for us. Dude is crucial on that end and is playing huge minutes as a starter while Tyler Herro is barely touching the floor.
Tyler herro pays like 20k a year for a personal chef or nutritionist. He's only a second year player. Many guys pay for things that are not thots
I think Tyler Herro is going to make some noise over his career
Tyler Herro is trash compared to Tatum
Gus be like Landry Shamet is a better asset than Tyler Herro
"Miami needs another star. Getting to the finals last year was a fluke. They are good, but not title material. What a massive mistake to not trade for Harden because you wanted to keep Tyler Herro, a Fischer-Price version of Steph Curry."
I had one last year in the Finals where Tyler Herro took a completely unnecessary 3 with time expiring in a game the Lakers already had won to cover the spread
"Draymond Green, Tyler Herro.   No other superstar rn really trash talks other than Luka so I can't really give an example there, Draymond is the closest rn"
Remember when Crowder went unconscious for a few games helping the Heat make the NBA finals and therefore deluding their fans to the point of not wanting to give up Tyler Herro for James Harden?
"And some people said Tyler Herro is untouchable for James Harden last year. Dumbass minority opinions exist everywhere, stop assuming that’s how every Celtic fan thinks lmao"
west coast Tyler Herro making a characteristic first play on the court
I just don't buy that story-  A 76-year old Pat Riley not trading for the league MVP in his prime because he didn't want to give up Tyler Herro.
but Tyler Herro is too valuable /s
"I mean, he’s certainly not the main piece, I’ll say that much. If you think someone like the Wiz are trading Bradley Beal for a package built around Tyler Herro you’re dreaming.   He’s a an okay scorer (pretty good 3-pt shooter but below average inside the arc), average rebounder and passer, and below average defender. He also has average at best physical tools. Again, he’s not valueless, but he’s not a centerpiece of any deal for a star."
"The culture shit, and also the macho bs image Jimmy tries to project so hard to the point it's cringeworthy. Some heat fans became insufferable after last season's bubble ~~fluke~~ success, for example that Tyler Herro smirk. He had the hot hand at the right time, that's it, and people made it sound like he's some big shot."
They wouldn’t give up Tyler Herro for Lowry so I’m not sure how keen he is on signing with a first round exit that undervalued him
Not sure what you mean?  Getting jimmy and their bubble run was kind of enjoyable.  I like tyler herro as well.  Why does that make me a new fan?
People have been slandering the heat since before dragic tried to injure jrue.  Tyler herro slander is probably behind maybe Simmons slander and jaylen brown slander in terms of best players to slander on this sub.
No way Tyler Herro is the main prospect in a kawhi trade though
Lol Heat fans wouldn't trade Tyler Herro for James Harden so it'll take them a while
"Kawhi will make the decision for them. If he wants out, then they will blow it up, if not, they will re-tool.   If Dallas beats them, I predict Kawhi gets dealt in some sign and trade to Miami involving Tyler Herro and Paul George goes to the Warriors for Wiseman, Wiggins, and picks."
All you have to do is look at Tyler Herro
"Look what he did between the Heatles and now. If you take out Butler throwing a temper tantrum to force his way to Miami, his track record isn’t stellar. Now, you obviously can’t just ignore a move he made, I’ll give you that, but he’s done more than enough to offset that.  Whiteside contract. Meyers Leonard contract. Igoudala contract. Tyler Johnson contract. Kelly O contract. James Johnson contract. Dion Waiters contract. Hell, he even picked Oladipo over Harden, because getting rid of Herro was deemed too much.   It’s not all sunshine and daisies. A lot of luck went in to them making the Finals run last year."
Didn’t Tyler Herro start bit was completely ass? Hence why they decided to put him back on the benvh
Don’t feel bad. Heat players and fans were so cocky all year “just wait until the playoffs”  Turns out they really were bubble frauds and Tyler Herro was Kuzma of the east
If anyone on the Heat is getting a pass it’s Jimmy. r/Heat has been coming down on Bam these last two games but Jimmy has been the worst player on the floor not named Tyler Herro this series.
But Tyler Herro is untouchable and no front office is dumb enough to include him for a 35 old PG
"To be fair, if I was a Jack Harlow fan who knew nothing about basketball, I'd probably think Tyler Herro was a superstar."
Tyler Herro playoffs last year: 16/5/3 on 55 TS%.  Tyler Herro this regular season: 15/5/3 on 54 TS%.
Tyler Herro was pretty good in the regular season last year.
Tyler Herro has been shit outside of bubble. I'm calling him bubble boy until he can prove he can do the same thing outside of bubble
Some slight Norris Cole type vibes with Tyler Herro....
"I guess people are finally realizing that Miami was one of the biggest flukes to ever happen in the playoffs so people are going at Jimmy.  They massively overperformed while the Bucks underperformed and Giannis got injured, then they got to play an injured Boston team and barely scraped by thanks to a massive overperformance by Tyler Herro.  Miami was probably the 4th best team in the East last year, but got to the NBA Finals due to injuries and a ridiculous overperformance, there's a reason why they got spanked by the Lakers despite Jimmy's heroics, they were never good enough to be there in the first place."
Does Tyler Herro = Jeremy Lin?
[Make a slick comment and see what that brings] (https://genius.com/Jack-harlow-tyler-herro-lyrics)
See Tyler Herro.... :(
 The lakers could do that because the only other ballhandler was rookie tyler herro.
Every since that Jack Hallow song Tyler Herro has been bad.
Tyler “my name is Flynn” Herro
Tyler “Gnarl” Herro
Best team in the league before the bubble. Funny how that works 🧐🧐  Tyler herro? Butler averaging 40 a game? Paul George having one of his worst career stretches ever? And lakers/heat fans deny the flukiness constantly
"Right here, bud lol. Honestly, if Bam doesn’t start to at least *look* like he gives a shit, MIL might just sweep the series. He’s a massive part of the offense and he’s been terrible. Tyler Herro effectively ceasing to exist hasn’t helped either lol. If we end up getting bounced early then at least beat the Nets lol"
"fringe all star? Calm down, I think RJ is gonna be a future all star and also I think Herro is gonna perform well next season and can be a future perennial all star (You just dont score 37 points which is 2nd behind magic if you are not good). RJ got to work on his game during the offseason while Tyler didn't becuz of the shortened off season. At the moment RJ is better, but we can get a better analysis next year."
"It does speak how overrated Tyler Herro is lol. 4 pts in 18 mins, yikes. You can bring up the injury excuse becuz he was balling before the playoffs started and looked healthy."
Tyler Herro bout to get amazon prime to Singapore.
You mean Tyler “Untouchable” Herro
At a high school game against Tyler Herro we chanted “pay your taxes” because word got out his dad was a tax evader
Oh no that would be Tyler Herro
98 points 🥶  40/29/69 splits 😈  Out rebounded 👀  Out passed 🔥  Tyler herro 4 points 🥵  Refused harden trade 😳
98 points 🥶  40/29/69 splits 😈  Out rebounded 👀  Out passed 🔥  Tyler herro 4 points 🥵
TyLeR hErRo is better than RJ
Is Tyler Herro really part of their big 3?i thought it was Dragic or maybe even Robinson.
Tyler Herro wannabe
"One fluke playoff run turned Jimmy Butler into a superstar, Bam Adebayo into a top 5 center and Tyler Herro into the next Devin Booker"
[Tyler Herro when he's not in the bubble:](https://i.gyazo.com/353819a6ab3ac7437157c2c8970aeea4.png)
Didn’t he dislocate rondos arm too?  Heat culture has consistently been based on trying to injure the other team.   Really just a classless franchise with no future (outside of future below average starter Tyler herro).
Bubble legend Tyler Herro was out scored by Jordan Nwora lmao
What the hell happened to Tyler Herro? Remember when he was off limits for the James Harden trade lol
These are the moments you keep Tyler Herro for.
Naz Reid or Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro really went from being in James Harden trade rumors to playing garbage minutes.
Are the Heat still glad to not have traded Tyler Herro for Harden?
HERE COMES TYLER HERRO!!!
Tyler Herro sucks. He was so overrated last year
He doesn’t even look that jacked?  [Nothing compared to Tyler Herro](https://i.redd.it/c1h3wjd4ff261.jpg)
Wtf are you winning with Tyler Herro? If an organization like Miami is shopping him that should tell you all you need to know
I’m not on this “Tyler Herro is overrated” wave that a lot of people seem to be on but this comment makes it seem like He’s somehow better than Collin Sexton and that’s just not true.   His defense is below average and so is his passing those aren’t things you can attach to Herro as if he brings those skills to the table at an elite or even very good level
"Lebron James is not injured. He played in every game. How is he injured? if we call people who are not %100 injured than every season has asterisks.   Even last year, heat had a line up of butler, crowder, duncan robinson, tyler herro and that nazi dude (literally can't remember his name) was on the court against the Lakers and LeBron said 'this was the hardest championship ever' and the nba nation didn't even blinked."
Tyler “The Black Luke Kennard’ Herro
"PG Steph  SG Tyler Herro  SF Kevin Durant  PF Giannis A.  C Rudy Gobert   Bench: Ben Simmons, Jae Crowder, Montrezl Harrell"
Miami has no picks and their best asset is Tyler Herro I think the cavs will look elsewhere
Tyler Herro may as well start shopping for property on Lake Erie then
"individual bubble stats have an asterisk imo and we shouldn’t act like any record set there should hold. we have to be honest and understand some of these guys like tyler herro are not that good, but the championship win is just as legit as any other win"
"Ayton, Luka, Trae, JJJ, Tyler Herro, and who else?"
There could be a sign and trade for Tyler Herro. Add salary filler like Andre Igodula and the trade should go through.
Does anyone else get the slight feeling that K'Von is this year's Tyler Herro
Huerter is this year’s Tyler Herro
Eh looking back there's not really anybody in that range that moves the needle much.  Maybe they get PJ Washington or Tyler Herro but what does that really do for them?
$40 mil for 4 years of Tyler Herro sounds like a good deal to me
Would you rather give $40-$50 million to THT or Tyler Herro? Bc I kinda cringe at the thought of the Heat giving that to Herro.
"Reggie. I’m tired of Tyler Herro being our “scoring punch”. I would much rather have Reggie Jackson out on the floor in crunch time than him. Cam Payne, as good as he is, is somewhat redundant with our team. The Heat have shot creators, but not shot makers."
"That's how the playoffs have to go. Superstars can be superstars, but without the other role players stepping up, teams become lost causes. Looking at the Nets with Joe Harris, or the Heat with Tyler Herro."
"Does it make him racist?  For that time period he wasn’t wrong. Socio-economic factors and culture were highly divided by race at that time.  Nowadays it’s a lot closer. Like Tyler Herro isn’t Larry Bird ‘White’. We also have a lot of mixed race players today, and even more mixed culture players."
Tyler Herro and it’s not even close. Dumb ass heat fans were saying they wouldn’t do harden for Herro straight up
"The meme of the guy who can’t decide which button to push, but it’s the Miami Heat and they can’t decide between “trading for Dame” and “thinking that Tyler Herro is a sleeper super star”"
"&gt;Strengths: defense, high motor players, strength  &gt;Tyler Herro  what"
u soundin like a hater ngl   and i think tyler herro is some mid but like. damn man cuz he made a facial expression??
"I don’t hate Tyler Herro, just think he is painfully corny"
"Lol my favorite dude had a Tyler Herro jersey on, and his friend with a Luka jersey. They just started chaos for everyone, it was fun."
"76ers w simmons, maxey, thybulle and/or milton. simmons has lowered trade value now but it will give trailblazers the defense they need.  nets for irving since it's reported they may trade him.  heat for tyler herro and/or duncan plus some picks."
There weren't much better offers out there. We see how Ben Simmons and Tyler Herro are panning out lol.
Obviously Tyler Herro for Dame and a first.
What’s he going to trade? A Cuban sandwich and Tyler herro?  Ben simmons is on his way to the blazers. Hopefully he develops a shot there like how fultz discovered middys in Orlando.
"Warriors can add in Paschall and then that allows them to match salary to get Covington back in the trade too. Covington doesn’t have too much value after being exposed in Houston / Portland, but maybe Kerr can pull something more out of him, and it gives them someone to replace Wiggins in the rotation.   I think this is the best package for Portland. I think Simmons / Ingram packages would be shortsighted and they should focus on a more longterm rebuild and get some top draft picks as you develop Wiseman, the Warriors picks, and whatever you get for CJ (Tyler Herro and Precious Achiuwa?)"
"&gt;DA has a solid midrange, is one of the best rebounders in the league, has great court vision for a big, one of the better hookshots in the league, does well against most guards on the perimeter, defends the paint as well as any other center, is good at staying out of foul trouble, and doesn't take plays off. Meanwhile, Herro can shoot the ball, and when that shot isn't falling, he's a detriment to the team.  He has all of that but he barely attempts any shoots that aren't pointblank at the rim.    &gt;I'm done with this one. The fact that I have to defend Ayton&gt;Tyler Herro in terms of talent, effectiveness, and potential just says to me that you're either trolling or just a remarkably dense homer (and I don't think it's the former).   I never said that Herro was better than Ayton I was just comparing the circumstances. You can't say the way Herro was playing last summer wasn't a great showing for a rookie like you can't say that the way Ayton is playing now isn't also really great but you also can't take a biased 12 game samplesize and determine a player rankings based on that.  If we went by last years playoffs Jimmy Butler was a top 5 player in the NBA and if we went by this playoffs Jimmy Butler is a bottom 100 player in the NBA  &gt;Oh no, a team's sub hyped up their guy. What a crime. I'm talking about here, in the land of multiple fanbases where opinions aren't as uniform as team subs. Most of the people I see putting Ayton above KAT are not Suns flairs.  I mean Suns fans are the first one's to jump in and say how there is a conversation about DA being better than KAT, I can link you all the instances of them doing that if you want. But I have watched both of them and the difference between them is a chasm (otherwise every center in the nba could shoot and score like KAT...)."

In parting, I hope KAT and the Wolves can make a playoff push next season. I like KAT and D'Lo, and was really sad to see Rubio go from the Suns."
"&gt;Not really, no. I think you're trying really hard to push some sort of ""gotcha"" moment when you're comparing a roleplayer with one particular talent to a multifaceted player who can help his team win games even if he's having an off night.   How was Tyler Herro a roleplayer last playoffs? He even scored 37 in the ECF. And how is DA a multifaceted player? He rolls to the basket and defends.  &gt;Ayton has 100% stepped it up these playoffs, I'm not disputing that, but anybody who has watched Ayton play throughout the season is not surprised by what he's doing. The reason you're getting so many people saying he's better than KAT right now (which from what I've seen, isn't even predominantly Suns fans) is because for a lot of people, this is their first time watching Ayton play more than a game or two a season and they're seeing in real time what he can do.  You literally had multiple threads on /r/suns about the subject and they are the first one to say that. If KAT doesn't average 30 on Ayton I'd be inclined to agree."
"Tyler Herro also can't defend a stop sign, so when his shot is off, he's worthless.  When Ayton's shot is off (which doesn't happen much since he's generally playing at the rim), he's still the anchor of a top 5-10 defense. On top of that, Ayton is clearly just a much better player than Herro."
Okay but Tyler Herro was also playing out of his mind in the bubble and here we are next season back to Earth.
3 posts by this guy.  Two about Ben Simmons being worse than Cameron Payne and Tyler Herro.  Now one where KAT is better than Embiid.
but would Miami trade Tyler Herro for him
Nah it’s the hawks and Heurter is this year Tyler herro
Clippers need Tyler Herro he built different 💯💯😈
Tyler Herro
People on this subreddit really are amazing. Even if we ignore the players contracts and salary cap Tyler Herro is just straight up not better than Ben Simmons. Also why would the Heat want to surround Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler with even less spacing lol?
Kevin Love - idk any white player with braids (even Tyler Herro) would totally surprise me
"Boston lost to Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson because Spoelstra is so much better than Brad Stevens and Jaylen Brown was and still is the worst defender in the NBA. Credit to the Heat but Tatum deserved better from his team, we shouldn't have lost that series."
"Trade idea:   Raptors get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Marvin Bagley  Kings get:   * OG Anunoby  * Tyler Herro  * Precious Achiuwa  * Rodney Hood (filler)  * 2022, 2024, 2026 Raptors 1sts  * 2024, 2026, 2028 Heat 1sts  Let's say the Raptors draft Suggs. They will have a lot of cap space so let's say they sign John Collins or Richaun Holmes. Then they run something like Suggs/Fred/Butler/Siakam/Collins. That's a good playoff team.   Heat pay up to move on from their aging core to get one of the top young players in the game. Fox is a beast, averaging 25/4/7 last season. Plus they get a reclamation project in Bagley, who still has potential. A Fox/Bam duo could be built around for the next decade.  Kings get a a quality young wing, a promising young point guard, a promising young big man, and six 1sts to continue their rebuild.  They can go forward with Haliburton/Hield/Anunoby/Barnes/???, with Herro/(Ninth Pick)/Precious off the bench. That's a solid young core."
"&gt; career TS% from a guy who has recently become a star is more than laughable. But you know that, you also know why volume and TS is more impressive than just TS … (I hope)  You’re welcome to look at his efficiency since he became a star.  2014/15 - 22.9 ppg on 56.2 TS%  2016/17 - 22.7 ppg on 52.8 TS%  2017/18 - 15.8 ppg on 55.7 TS%  2018/19 - 19.4 ppg on 56.4 TS%  2019/20 - 22.2 ppg on 61.6 TS%  2020/21 - 14.5 ppg 39.4 TS%  Keep in mind that league average TS% was lower back in 2014 then it is now. He’s really only had 2 “inefficient” runs. 2016/17 and 2020/21. The rest are either average, above average or elite.  &gt; average efficiency? Sure. He also regularly DIPS in efficiency even when he could shoot.  This is true for most players. When the playoffs come around defences tighten up and efficiency goes down.  &gt; Jesus Christ. Tatum came off an injury that clearly affected him and wasn’t playing well at first. Regardless, my entire POINT isn’t about their respective percentages in the regular season, it’s about how they can elevate to scoring heights in the playoff. Tatums volume is more sustainable because he can SHOOT the basketball.  But the elevate part isn’t true though. Tatum’s efficiency either dips or remains the same literally every season of his career.  2017/18 - 58.6 TS% (RS) to 57.8 TS% (PS)  2018/19 - 54.7 TS% (RS) to 53 TS% (PS)  2019/20 - 56.7 TS% (RS) to 56.3 TS% (PS)  2020/21 - 57.6 TS% (RS) to 57.7 TS% (PS)  Don’t get me wrong, the fact that he maintains those averages pretty consistently is incredibly impressive. To say he *elevates* them in the postseason is just straight up not true. Which is fine, the list of players who’s efficiency actually goes up in the playoffs is very very short.   &gt;Jimmy whose efficiency dips in the playoffs anyways, has now forgotten how to shoot. Why is that significant? Because now as a player he depends on getting to the line to bolster his efficiency. In the playoffs, it becomes easier for elite defensive teams to hone in on that much more than they can a 3 level scorer like Tatum with elite 3 point creation.  I mean, not really. He was incredibly efficient last postseason with no jumpshot. It’s only this season that he’s really been inefficient.  &gt;1.) the attention he received was MUCH different than what he’s going to get going further. The HeT aren’t a surprised team anymore.   This is the most ridiculous made up “reason” I’ve ever seen for a player playing well. Teams know who Butler is. Nobody was game planning for fucking Tyler Herro last season lmao  &gt;That Bucks series was not just Jimmy not playing well, it was a textbook example of a team shutting down a star. Which is infinitely much harder for a player like Tatum.  It’s marginally harder, not “infinitely”. You’re speaking solely in exaggerations."
"&gt; you’re 23 your ceiling is pretty much the sky  Not if you're Tyler Herro, his ceiling was the bubble"
Tyler Herro is this years Terrance Mann and Reggie Jackson. Performing well for their teams and playing well. Trae Young is inspiring kids and the younger generation. I’m not saying he’s the next MJ but he’s for sure the next “demi-god” for Atlanta
"Yeah he's definitely all over the place right now, but I do think we have to see how much he stays in the national spotlight next season before we label him definitively arrived as a superstar.  I mean, this time last year Tyler Herro was a household name. Obviously those two aren't even on the same level of potential superstardom, but I just don't think one playoffs ensures you've arrived. You've gotta sustain it."

Tyler Herro for Lonnie Walker and a week of hanging out with the Coyote
"""Tyler Herro has shown that he can perform at the highest level in the playoffs in his rookie season. So let's trade him and his extremely cap-friendly contract after one bad year, when his value is nice and low.""   Does this guy think the Heat is run by r/nba?"
He's no Tyler Herro I'll give you that
Calling it now. This is another Tyler Herro situation. Overhyped potential because of a few playoff games.
Good guy Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro to the cavs
"Up to speed on what? He's not looking for survivors, he's not providing first aid, the dude is just dropping of food and water for victims of a tragedy. Who cares who drops that stuff off. Only people who need to find a reason to shit on someone. As a self proclaimed Tyler Herro hater this is not something to shit on him for. Unless he's got that dumb ass ""snarl"" on his face while he's handing out stuff."
Tyler herro &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 😤
"I read that as ""Tyler Herro arrived offloading police out of a truck"" and my heart skipped a beat!"
Tyler Herro redemption arc begins
Plus a pretty great end to their rookie year and starting during the all star game and averaging 29/10 their sophomore year.  This isn’t Tyler Herro or Bubble Murray.
"You’re right, Tyler Herro got the same treatment last year"
Tyler Herro vs Kevin Huerter you say?
Tyler Herro?
Kevin Huerter really is a likeable Tyler Herro without a punchable face.
Tyler Herro put up 16/4  Trae is putting up 30/10
Comparing Bubble Tyler Herro to Trae is an insult tbh
No not even close. All star? Yeah. Superstar? No.   Is Tyler Herro a superstar because he performed well and made it to the finals?  Give Trae a few more years of performance like this and I'd be on board.

"&gt;There’s 4 teams left playing. This shit is gonna happen every year in the playoffs, so get used to it. It just happens to be occurring with a player you don’t like now   It's not that I don't like DA but he's clearly not at a level you present him at. Same as last season with Tyler Herro he had an amazing playoffs and dropped back to a level that he really was."
"Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn, and Duncan Robinson would help Philly I feel like. Duncan starts and have Tyler run the backcourt for the bench?"
We are all Tyler Herro. We are all from Tropoje
All of them Tyler Herro
"First Tyler Herro, then Kevin Huerter, now Caruso with ""Hood tendencies pt 3"" lol"
"Lmao, the moment when Tyler Herro became Tyrone Herro"
Is there any evidence of this? Or are we assuming he's going through something personal because he's performing worse?  Do we assume the same for Tyler Herro and Dennis Schroeder?
Terance Mann is this playoffs' Tyler Herro.
"Alright, fair enough. I don't even consider Herro a bad playoff performer myself, I just think it's a little too early to act like it's ridiculous to take Kevin Huerter over Tyler Herro if we're gonna use one good playoff performance as a judgment, because Huerter's been good in this postseason too and it's his first one, just like with Herro last year. Herro's good playoffs is better than Huerter's so far, but Huerter is doing far more than expected, too. He's a huge reason the Hawks are in the ECF, and it's hard to rank carrying your team through a game 7 versus something like dropping 37 to go up 3-2."
"Herro was Tyler this playoffs, and Tyrone last playoffs."
"&gt;Are people seriously pretending they’d rather have guys like Dennis Schroeder, Tyler Herro, and Colin Sexton  We would be in the ECF if we had Sexton or Shroeder. Because they actually have to be accounted for offensively. I would trade Ben for Sexton without hesitation."
"Let’s be real. The idea that dozens of his peers have leapfrogged him is ridiculous.  Would you rather have Kemba Walker than Simmons? Murray? Derozan?   I’ll agree that his value has taken a hit but he’s still all-nba defense.   And to your point, he is more of a regular season guy…but so what? If this is the best he is and ever will be…that’s still damn good and not worse than 30-32 players in the NBA.   I think the thought of him being the #2 piece on a title team has lost its luster a bit…but the third best player on a title team? Are people seriously pretending they’d rather have guys like Dennis Schroeder, Tyler Herro, and Colin Sexton? Sure they can sometimes put it in the whole but that’s about where it begins and ends.  Ben might not be what we all thought he could be, but what he is, is still a borderline all-star talent even if you have to take him out for hack-a-Ben situations. Which really just means you need a secondary ball-handler in crunch time. His defense is elite. As is his passing and rebounding. If he could develop even a below average jumper and just be more aggressive he would easily be flirting with all-nba lists again, but if he doesn’t who cares? Way worse players than Ben Simmons have made max money."
"All Jimmy Butler, maybe Bam too, then all Tyler Herro"
Better defender than Tyler Herro
"Duncan Robinson is the real spacer in our offense, not Tyler Herro"
We famously lost out on Tyler Herro because of a coin flip. He was going to be our pick.
100% agree he needs more credit. Never see his name floating up its always Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro  Even Bam needs more credit
I’d definitely act like Harden or Tyler Herro or Maybe just banging IG thots left and right.
"But you said few guys used the midrange and it’s pretty clear that’s not the case. An assortment of guys is relying on the midrange to score more than Booker is.  Guys these playoffs averaging more midrange attempts than restricted area attempts include Embiid, Middleton, Westbrook, Randle, Tatum, CP3, Butler, CJ, Kyrie, Dragic, MPJ, Melo, Bogdan, Ish, Hunter, Marcus Morris, Gallinari and a whole lot of others  More midrange than three include: KD, Embiid, Westbrook, Butler, CP3, Rose, AD, Ish, Lou Williams, Tyler Herro, Tyrese Maxey, and Jabari Parker among others.  It’s just not accurate that Booker is one of the few players with a midrange game."
Lmao right I forgot Tyler herro can get u any superstar
"My list is different  Contracts matter. Several of these guys are negative value assets, so it doesn't matter that Tyler Herro isn't worth a lot, if you trade him you'll still get an asset back. While you'd have to give something up to get rid of Kemba  My list:  1. CJ 2. Simmons 3. Harris 4. Herro (this might be low) 5. Porzingis 6.  Kemba  Schroder is a free agent, there's nothing to trade (unless sign and trade, but we can't know that contract)"
"The only 2 people that have the tenacity, and are willing to give 200% to win games were Embiid and Butler, of course butter soft Simmons could not handle that. Very good play by the 76ers FO, next year Butler made the finals hahaha. Tyler herro is now the Simmons of heat let's see how they adress it."
The Tyler herro trade was never real cause the heat just didn't have enough assets to make the trade. However the ben simmons trade was very real but didn't happen. Somehow this sub doesn't talk about that tho cause they don't despise simmons like they do herro...for some reason
And so he decided to stick with notoriously hard worker *Checks Notes* Tyler Herro?
"At this point, what is the best package anyone could get for Simmons?  Even at his peak, they were never getting Harden.  With the teams that are out now, who would want him?    Gobert-Kristaps-Simmons/Harris-CJ McCollum, Tyler Herro are the players that may be shipped off."
Idk if Embiid exhibits heat culture. Tyler Herro is what Miami needs
"Fucking Herro lmao, they didn't wanna give up Tyler Herro. That is insane."
"&gt; A trade that didn't happen... Meaning he wasn't good enough to get that player. &gt;  &gt;   We don't know why the trade didn't go through, so this isn't entirely accurate.  &gt;Going by this hypothetical, Simmons has less value than Tyler Herro, who was too promising to even be put into a trade offer.  The difference is the Heat were clowned for thinking Herro was too good for a trade package for Harden, so that was bad decision making on their part. The Sixers weren't clowned for attempting to get Harden via Simmons.  &gt;Also worth pointing out that the Rockets were rumored to have tried to call around for Simmons offers at the time and could only get protected FRPs from Sacramento... So definitely less potential value than Brooklyn's unprotected ones.  Yeah if this actually happened than my point is moot. But I doubt we'll ever get true confirmation."

"The solution for Morey - sell high on Embiid by sending him to Miami in a 3-team deal and surround Simmons with more shooters to maximize Simmons desire to pass up open dunks for open three-pointers.   Here's the deal: We send Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Oladipo, and our 2025 FRP to Philly because mOrE ShOoTeRs! OKC unlocks protections on our 2023 FRP and we send them our 2028 FRP. We all know how Presti loves him those FRPs! OKC also sends Kemba Walker to Miami, we'll take that bad boy's contract on!   Philly can run a starting lineup of Simmons, Curry, Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, and Danny Green, with Maxey, Thybulle, and Victor Oladipo off the bench for some added defense. Just imagine how many assists Ben would get per game!"
people said you cant trade Tyler Herro for Harden too
Tyler Herro wants to be him so bad
Idk man. Is he better than Steven Adams? Eric Bledsoe? Tyler Herro? Seems like a stretch to me.
they really had tyler herro ranked 59 and demar ranked 82........ insane
Tyler Herro already greater than Harden so I’d put him at numba one.
Tyler Herro and KPJ
"Jimmy has always had top 10 advanced stats, but the Pistons team around Billups is also way better than Miami around Butler. Tyler Herro had couple games where he popped off, but he was nowhere near the player Richard Hamilton or Rasheed Wallace were.   Even this season, its showing that all the Miami role players just really aren't that good. Miami has mostly been a two man show between Butler and Bam. Herro has not been good, Robinson's shooting has been a little down compared to last year (he's still been good though). Crowder is gone. Dragic has been hurt and not as good. But Jimmy has still been great (even better than last regular season), and has carried Bulls and Timberwolves to the playoffs before. It wasn't just the bubble.  I don't think he's top 10, but he shouldn't be any lower than 12, maybe 13 considered how well Paul George has played this season."
"Hey Jayson! Somewhat of a random question, but do you have any advice for Tyler Herro this season? I feel like both of you came off similar rookie seasons and are/were going through similar struggles as a 2nd year pro."
Tyler Herro
Most people realize there was a 0% chance the Rockets were trading Harden for Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson.
Tyler Herro and Kyle Kuzma. Casuals either overrate or underrate them a ton
Tyler Herro
Gotta justify not trading Tyler Herro for him somehow
I remember all the delusional heat fans telling me Tyler Herro was better last year. As if a rookie season determines anything lol.
"OK but Tyler Herro had a great bubble performance, RJ could never!"
"they contended in a once in a generation basketball event which clearly benefitted some heat players in unsustainable ways lol  Tyler Herro is not the guy he was in the bubble. Hell dragic isnt even that guy. A lot of guys did way better in the bubble in an unsustainable way  the heat hentai fucked the east last year in the bubble, they were contenders  i do not think they currently are this season, and need roster changes to get anywhere back to the bubble level"
&gt;Tyler Herro is also not playing as good as last year although I always thought he was a little overrated.
"Dude is gonna die on the sword of Tyler Herro.  Pat Riley really screwed it this year. I think the heat just aren’t sure if they’re a rebuilding team around Herro and Bam, or a contending team around Dragic and Butler so they signed Oladipo instead of Kyle Lowry and didn’t trade herro for James Harden. That was honestly so stupid, and our front office traded Luka."
Tyler Herro is one of the most overrated and decently known players
"1. John Stockton 2. Tyler Herro 3. Rick Barry 4. Kevin Love 5. Nikola Jokic  Hard working, lunch pail type of guys who are always first in last out. Not the flashiest players, but constant performers."
I don’t care what the situation is. You don’t lose to a hawks team missing Trae Young and Clint Capela if you’re a playoff contender. Also give more minutes to Iggy putting up a goose egg than Tyler Herro.
Kevin huerter is who Tyler Herro wants to be

Tyler Herro
Celtics will win the championship this year   Tyler Herro is a poor mans kyle Kuzma and Jimmy Butler doesn’t have a great work ethic he just has a bad sleep schedule.  Order restored  Also Bam... fuck it I can’t even make something up about Bam. He’s dope.
"&gt; Not sure about the rest of the team  I saw someone point out Marcus Smart is shooting more 3s, more efficiently than Tyler Herro, so not great I'd assume.  He's having a down year."
Tyler Herro
I’m glad we didn’t trade for Tyler Herro cause he is someone who definitely would’ve accidentally dropped that
Tyler Herro   Jimmy Butler    Ben Simmons   Zion Williamson    Pascal Siakam
You’re forgetting Tyler herro
"So JR Smith, Javale McGhee, and all the Lakers benchwarmers can do all their crazy celebrations throughout the series but when Tyler Herro does a celebration after hitting the dagger it’s crossing the line?"
Repost but I'm going to repost my comment and say that RJ Barrett is better than Tyler Herro
Oh god incoming Tyler Herro hate for no reason
If you are Kyle Kuzma or Tyler Herro - you should be humble. If you are Joel Embiid or Kevin Durant or anybody of this caliber - you shouldn't.
Tyler herro in the hall of fame yet?
“Every young player” not just tyler herro. Yall angry we didnt give up our farm that helped us reach the finals lmao.
All that fame powered up Tyler Herro.
What the fuck did the Spurs do to Tyler Herro?
Tyler Herro told this sub to suck his dick
Tyler Herro definitely heard all of that negative talk about him lol
Tyler Herro with a -129 +/- ranking this season
"I think he has; how many guys taken after Garland would you take over him? The only ones with a case are Coby White, Rui Hachimura, Cam Johnson, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro, Chuma Okeke, Nickeil Alexander Walker, Matisse Thybulle, Brandon Clarke, and Lu Dort. I'd personally take Garland over all those guys except maybe Dort."
MVP Like Me ft. Tyler Herro
"Tyler Herro was snarling down two games in the finals, imagine him with a ring"
if you're buying weed off someone that looks like tyler herro... brother u might be smoking mid
But I still disagree with your point on tyler herro
How is that relevant to Tyler Herro?
"""Tyler Herro is famous and he is slumping.""  There, summarized the garbage article."
See Tyler Herro for reference
"If I’m layin in bed with my girl, I’m not gonna have Tyler Herro on my mind.  But if we are talking about a player that has constantly throughout their careers been compared to Herro, a large portion of that being Heat fans, what is so wrong about bringing that up if I’m a Knicks fan?   For the second part, I literally said “he definitely has a future” which pretty clearly implied I was admitting I was wrong at the time. Romeo also has a future, but obviously he hasn’t shown as much as Herro. I said I was really hoping the Heat drafted him because of those reports and it was common knowledge if he fell to us we would take him.  It’s pretty obvious to literally everyone, except for apparently you, that I was admitting I was wrong about him. I told you I didn’t like a certain part of your comment and explained why, then moved on from that and talked about the other point, complimenting the player you currently feel the need to suck off.   Just hold the L and delete the comments my man."
"""Rent free is dumb no one is thinking about this dude at night""  \*proceeds to write a paragraph about why nobody is thinking about him in a thread where he was randomly brought up\*  &gt;I’m pretty sure I remember really hoping the Heat drafted him because he looked awful in that NCAA tournament “run”  I'm sure you're ecstatic with having Romeo Langford who was drafted 1 pick after him and has 101 career points in 2 seasons.  Bonus: [Report: Celtics were ‘very much enamored’ with Tyler Herro, whom Heat took one pick before Boston](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/09/23/report-celtics-were-very-much-enamored-with-tyler-herro-whom-heat-took-one-pick-before-boston/)  [Tyler Herro says his 2019 NBA draft suit is at his parent's house, ""It's probably too small for me now. It was already tight."" He reflected on Instagram Live that he thought he was going a pick later to the Celtics.](https://twitter.com/IraHeatBeat/status/1328838481670524929)"
And Tyler Herro
"I can't believe Tyler Herro said this, smh the fame is really getting to him"
Making troll accounts to hate on Tyler herro lmfao. Like imagine actually being mad about something Tyler herro did a year ago in your day to day life
Tyler Herro and Jimmy Butler in shambles.
"&gt; Tyler herro after trade deadline* and before the last 4 games  That's 8 of 58 games my man, if you cherrypicked any harder you could retire on the profits of your cherry farm"
"The rust belt of America was cumming for him non stop for the entire year like Linsanity. Tyler Herro is like the UFC's Stipe Miocic. Anyone who was a long shot and worked his ass off to achieve great success. That's basically the modern American dream, and if that manifests in someone that ""looks like me"" you know they're gonna get fans. Stipe, Herro, Pacquiao, Obama, and so on."
"You say ""change everything"" but there's literally nothing to change. There's no rules that say it has to be done one way or another. The voters could decide to award Tyler Herro tomorrow and they wouldn't be breaking any rules.   Not to get too philosophical, but Thomas Jefferson once wrote to James Madison that he thought every generation should write its own Constitution because it will have its own way of doing things and its own values, and it shouldn't be trapped by the thinking of the past. I tend to agree. In fact, Jokic being the #4 seed would have been far too low not too long ago."
Tyler Herro: Never stop never stopping.
Rumor has it Tyler herro did it which explains the report from earlier that the heat are worried about him
"Tyler Herro - 15/5/3   42% FG   33% 3%   81% FT  Ja Morant -  19/3/7  44% FG   27% 3%  74% FT  Both are 52% TS  Yet Morant is considered a superstar in the making and deserves praise for every little thing he does, but Herro needs to be criticized all year long on every play he makes."
&gt; Houston’s asking price from Miami in a James Harden trade: &gt;  .. &gt; &gt; Tyler Herro  &gt; Duncan Robinson  &gt; Precious Achiuwa  &gt; Kendrick Nunn  &gt; Salary Filler  &gt; Two 1st-Round Picks  &gt; 4 Pick Swaps &gt;  ..  &gt; Miami was not interested  That is so worth James Harden for 2 fucking years guaranteed lmao. You get to keep Bam and get an instant big 3.
Imagine caping this hard on the internet for Tyler Herro. You've done it. I'm convinced this article is complete slander.
Tyler herro after trade deadline* and before the last 4 games : 19.3 ppg 41% 3pfg%  Heat playing through a schedule of 8 games in 12 days with multiple back to backs. Entire team looks fatigued.   Before his 3 injuries earlier in the season he was also averaging 18 ppg giving good minutes.   Everybody shows up when hes having bad games but never when hes playing well
"tyler herro is huge on social media, especially among white kids."
Its also a reminder that player value flactuates pretty quickly. Just last offseason there was a real debate on whether you would rather have Tyler Herro or the number 1 pick in the 2020 draft
"Define “good.” You said he’s “pure ass.” Going by BPM (worse than Kuz), here are some players this year that are crystal-grade ass:  Schröder  RJ Barrett  PJ Washington  KCP  Seth Curry  Darius Garland  Tyler Herro  Gary Trent JR  Lou Williams  Ricky Rubio  Lu Dort  Ant Edwards  Dillon Brooks"
Maybe and I say this very carefully maybe Tyler Herro.
Tyler Herro is more than an NBA player  He’s more than a celebrity  And he’s more than a sandwich
I just can't believe that's true. James Harden in a wheelchair will most likely be better than prime Tyler Herro. There's just no way Riley turned down teaming up Harden and Butler for Chet Hanks.
"&gt;Offtopic but are people really into her? Like I don't find her body type appealing at all.   Clearly, Tyler is into her. You don't have to find her body type appealing -- she appeals to Herro and the millions who follow her on social media. No one says you have to find her attractive, but why are you questioning the ppl who do?"
"&gt;I'm sure his ""untouchable"" status in James Harden trade talks helped with that perception  [Miami reportedly open to James Harden trade; Tyler Herro not untouchable](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/12/miami-reportedly-open-to-james-harden-trade-tyler-herro-not-untouchable/) \- from 27 year Miami Herald veteran writer Barry Jackson who regularly breaks Heat news and is extremely reliable.  Sorry to break up the circlejerk but nobody ever even reported that the Heat wouldn't trade Herro for Harden."
"When Jack Harlow dropped the Tyler Herro video, I knew he was going to be a bust."
Tyler Herro is like a Disney Channel version of Steph Curry.
"Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson and Oladipo can play the best basketball of their lives and the Nets would still win in 4-5 games lmao"
"I think a lot of it depends on the play of Tyler Herro, Victor Oladipo and to an extent, Duncan Robinson.   We know Jimmy is going to get it done on both ends, we know bam is going to get it done on both ends (guarding one of the 3 superstars every possession), and we know Dragic can boost the offense.   But Herro, his offense is needed to help match the Nets offense. He can’t be streaky, he needs to be consistent. Same for VO. I’m sure his defense will be fine, but he needs to get buckets.   Another X factor could be a guy like Kendrick Nunn, but the Heat seem to lean towards Dragic and Herro when it matters.    So, with that being said; if Herro and VO play well; Heat in 7   If not; Nets in 6"
Tyler Herro in shambles
No Tyler Herro is though
"Uhhh, what? Bam is one of the best two way centers in the league, and he's only 23 lol.  He's not a selfish player, nor does he take a lot of shots. Most MIA fans wish he was more aggressive. Dude takes 12.9 FGA on 57/25/81 shooting splits... To put that into perspective Tyler Herro takes 13.1 FGA 43/33/82 shooting splits...  I mean... Who'd you rather have taking more shots?   19/9/5 isn't showing much? Come on fam, Bam is literally the NBA comparison that I hope Timelord becomes."
It was Tyler my bad. I wish there were like 3 or 4 seconds added to this clip to show Kyrie waving Brown off but this is it.   https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=520&amp;GameID=0022000863&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Herro%2025%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20(9%20PTS)%20(Adebayo%204%20AST)&amp;sct=plot
"Man Tyler Herro looked so bad. I only watched the last quarter, but everytime he got the ball their offense just died."
tyler herro really started hesitating on scoring opportunities and started stinkin’ up the joint RIGHT after
Tyler herro and Duncan Robinson have the most punchable faces in the history of the NBA
There were dudes this past off-season calling Tyler Herro better than him lol.
Tyler Herro is average
"PG- IT SG- JJ Redick SF-Norm Powell PF-Ilyosova(I think that’s right?) C- Thomas Bryant bench PG-Chris Clemons SG-Tyler Herro SF-Caris LaVert PF-Gary Clark C-Luke Kornet I had one goal, no defense. Pretty sure this team could score 200 and give up 200 points."
"* Prime DRose wasn't all that * Ben Simmons created himself a DPOY campaign by talking and people are buying it * KG was better than Dirk (shouldn't be a debate but it is) * Tyler Herro is the most overrated player in the NBA * KAT can be a 1st option on a championship quality team (media repeatedly mentioning that he should be a 3rd or 2nd option at best for the wolves to contend, but prior to this season, it was consensus that he was better than Book?)"
You’re acting like keeping an All star two-way guard under contract for 5 years that averages like 25 is the same thing as keeping Tyler freaking Herro lmfaooo
softest player on that team is Tyler Herro tbh
"He literally couldn’t that’s the worst part, rookies over performing in the playoffs is like when college players ball out in March madness. They become just insanely overrated. Basically Tyler Herro Tyrian Thomas’d the Heat"
"Chill with the Tyler Herro stuff, He's going through a sophomore slump off of a short off-season. Next season should really tell us if he's about all the hype."
Neither will be a superstar so it’s irrelevant lol.   Tyler “untouchable” Herro will always be hilarious though
Tyler “Culture” Herro
tyler herro hasnt played up to expectations but jimmys been great? idk how either of them are big headed?
What about Tyler Herro?
"It's Greg Sylvander, and he has no credibility at all. He's a heat fan with twitter followers who makes guesses and calls them reports and has never broken news. And the report about Herro  [was denied](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/12/miami-reportedly-open-to-james-harden-trade-tyler-herro-not-untouchable/) by the most reliable South Florida reporter (Barry Jackson, Miami Herald) 2 days after Sylvander's fake report.  Sylvander and the ""organization"" he works for (5 reasons sports) have been caught lying about multiple other things this year, including:   Lamarcus Aldridge to Miami being a done deal (via Sylvander),   Oladipo not getting traded to Miami (via Sylvander, ""reported"" 5 minutes before he was traded).   Kyle Lowry to Miami being a done deal,   And most notably, they also made up the report that Jimmy Butler [declined an all star game invitation](https://heatnation.com/rumors/report-jimmy-butler-was-chosen-to-be-all-star-but-he-refused-to-attend-game-without-bam-adebayo/) because Bam didn't make it, which the league put out a statement [denying](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/nba_denies_that_jimmy_butler_rejected_all_star_invite/s1_13132_34242260)  The Heat had 0 first round picks available to trade, they were never getting Harden. This report about Herro/Harden never made sense, what would the offer have even been? Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson and 2 2nd round picks for Harden?"
[You mean this face?](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tyler+Herro+snarl&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enCA776CA776&amp;oq=Tyler+Herro+snarl&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i19l5.6213j0j4&amp;hl=en-US&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8#imgrc=5DJzLh09TPPH0M)
"Whether you would accept the trade or not is a fair argument, but the notion that they didn’t trade for Harden JUST to keep Tyler Herro is preposterous"
But Tyler Herro could be anything! He could even turn into prime James Harden!
"Fucking idiots, who cares what Tyler Herro could turn into you get prime JAMES HARDEN right now"
"Difference is they schemed for Harden, Tyler Herro was an afterthought in the Lakers minds😂"
"If Tyler Herro becomes James Harden, I will tattoo Ty-Ty on my butt."
Tyler Herro and Gordon Hayward.
Imagine saying that Tyler Herro is better lol
A decent amount of heat fans didn’t wanna trade tyler herro for him
Tyler herro could do this in his sleep
Tyler herro
"""They got lucky with the clippers collapse"" no one said they were ""lucky"" in the Miami series. Learn to read. The fact that they lost two games to a team whose second best player was Tyler Herro or Duncan Robinson doesn't scream dominance to me.  In game 6 Goran could barely walk and Bam was severely limited.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Clippers collapse showcased Nuggets ability and Clipper’s deficiencies, did you see Lakers gentlemen sweeping the nuggets after? You even see Nuggets balling this season as well, that was no fluke.   The nuggets are the 5'th seed in the west? Like what are you talking about. Maybe you should listen to Skip some more at least he seems to have the facts right even if he twist them horribly."
"That and Tyler Herro and Tyrese Maxley were too valuable, lol."
Rj Barrett and Tyler Herro
"Right lol if it was Duncan Robinson or Tyler Herro, you think Miami would remove him from their introductory video? Not a chance  The league chooses to set an example when they can afford to. I am not complaining because I don't really care but let's not be naive and think that they are the paragon of social justice"
I would rather have him on my team than Tyler Herro.
Tyler Herro too probably
Duncan Robinson was shooting 44.8% from three on 8.4 attempts per game pre-bubble. He shot 40.0% from three on 7.3 attempts per game through the Eastern Conference playoffs.  Tyler Herro is currently playing about the same as he was in the Eastern Conference playoffs.  Dragic has always been good.  You're acting like random scrubs played way above their heads and have since crashed back down to the earth.
NBA fans: Superteam bad! Rings invalid! It's unfair  NBA fans: Giannis pls come to Miami with Jimmy Butler (Top 10 player superstar who carried the finals) and Tyler Herro (future GOAT)
"And lest we forget 'Hood Tendencies' Herro, I'ma mention him real quick. Tyler Herro."
"Haslemberg to Herro:  ""I am not in danger, Tyler. I am the danger!"""
I really can't think of many from Milwaukee or even Wisconsin. Tyler Herro or Wes Matthews? Tyrese Haliburton?  EDIT: It's gotta be Latrell Sprewell
"Tyler Herro, AKA Baby Goat, is actually a baby."
"He was the most attractive Heat player. :(  Oh well, we still got Tyler Herro and Goran Dragic and Duncan Robinson."
I remember watching Tyler Herro not being able to give the ball up fast enough whenever he saw Jrue in his way early in the season. The fear was obvious.
Loool it was Tyler Herro from deep 🤣
TyLEr hErrO is better dude. Jack Harlow made a song about him. RJ is a bum and can't shoot.
Meyers Leonard is as good as gone... Jack Harlow AKA Tyler Herro will probably have to carry the Heat back to the Finals
Tyler “hood tendencies” herro grew up in one of the richest suburbs of Milwaukee. Nothing hood about him
"Tyler ""hood tendencies"" herro would never."
"You arent trading duncan robinson or tyler herro for a dude who averages 4ppg, even if he plays good defense"
"I defintely saw that as well. I think people took it like that just because the nets were doing it.  I also kinda agree with the other guy. The sixers had Ben Simmons, the Heat had Tyler Herro/Duncan Robinson, and best player the rockets got was an expiring oladipo. Like, not even one good young player came back from the harden trade."
Rockets definitely have buyers remorse after getting all those 30th overall Nets picks for Harden. Now they’re trying to get Tyler Herro or Duncan Robinson for PJ Tucker to try to get some of the stuff from the trade they should have pursued.
"""Ok the Heat won't give us Tyler Herro in the package for James Harden""  ""Have we tried offering him for PJ Tucker""?"
"I really don't get the Tyler Herro projections of him potentially being an all-nba guy (which Booker is close to now)  I think his ceiling is more like a Lou Williams-type player.. a great 4th option, butttt probably shouldn't be higher than that. He's not a good enough shooter/shot-creator/passer to be a first or second option in most starting lineups."
"Well he does hang around with a lot of black guys and Tyler herro so he probably hears the n word often  Listens to it  Oh, fuck him"
I feel like Tyler Herro is the leader of this Heat team due to his association with Katya Henry. Thoughts or comments?
do players like you and Tyler Herro feel the pressure when people say the reason for the Heat's troubles are guys like you two not taking a big enough leap this season?
"This is so disrespectful to Tyler Herro. When all said and done Herro will be the 4th best SG of all time, even above Dwyane Wade"
"I meant in terms of having an already strong same-conference contender get even stronger because they refused to give up Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson and some low 1sts."
Only one ball bro. Harden isn't good for locker room culture. Not worth trading Tyler Herro for

if you think tyler herro is hot then you should not be allowed within 5000 feet of a middle school
Tyler Herro is a 🪣
this right here is exactly why people started hating on tyler herro
"Tyler ""The Manwich"" Herro"
good point. a taller and skinnier tyler herro then
"Tyler Herro wasn't their second best player lol, that's just a meme  Dragic was much better"
"Guys like Kevin Love, Tyler Herro, Jokic, Doncic, Porzingis. Class acts"
Finals Winner: Heat  Finals MVP: Jimmy Butler  MVP: Jimmy Butler   DPOY: Bam Adebayo  ROY: Micah Potter  MIP: Tyler Herro
1. Darius Garland 2. Jaren Jackson Jr 3. KPJ 4. Tyler Herro 5. Rui Hachimura 6. James Wiseman  7. Bol Bol
Tyler Herro
I think Jordan Poole or Tyler Herro will get most improved player of the year award.
"What's your re-draft to include all 3 of them in the top 7? I think there's a pretty clear top 5 in Zion, Ja, RJ, Hunter and Garland, and then there's only two spots left for:  * Keldon Johnson  * Jordan Poole  * Kevin Porter Jr  * Rui Hachimura  * Tyler Herro  * PJ Washington  * Matisse Thybulle"
I’m kindof happy that Tyler Herro didn’t receive a vote. Hopefully that puts a chip on his shoulder.
Lol. It’s obviously Tyler herro
"the key for him and tyler herro will be if they can get to the rim well...you only can be so good being great tough shot makers at their size...i actually think poole might be a tad bigger than herro which will help him potentially...CJ is almost as good as it gets (besides the ATG player in this category, who are all likely bigger than CJ) in this realm so CJ is a great comp"
Jordan Poole redeems the city of Milwaukee for producing Tyler Herro.
Tyler herro and Drummond are fuckin trash tht is mid and cam thomas won't get minutes in the playoffs and poole is probably just a role player
You gotta love recency bias.   All NBA first team  Tyler Herro  Jordan Poole  THT  Cam Thomas  Andre Drummond
tyler herro&gt;
Tyler Herro only missed 3 of his 12 shots tonight I think he could have a comeback year
"Pre season legends THT, Andre Drummond, Tyler Herro, and Cameron Thomas"
Look at box scores around the league today. Everybody sucked except for Tyler Herro.
Tyler Herro is the classiest player in the league right now except Luka is classier
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"This is why I think y’all will be super dangerous this year with having an actual off-season to rest. People joked about Tyler Herro being a bubble fluke, but imagine after your first NBA season getting all the way to the finals and then getting only 2.5 months off. A real off-season of development for him and the pieces y’all brought in, gonna be a really good season for y’all I feel"
"The Heat. I think Jimmy Butler, Tyler Herro and Kyle Lowery would be endlessly entertaining and getting a look at ""Heat Culture"" could be interesting."
Tyler Herro in the Bubble Playoffs
"There was a thread yesterday about who has better potential going forward, Kendrick Nunn(26) or Tyler Herro(21). Easy to say, some people have no idea those two have this big of an age difference."
"People always relate Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro as Miami's ""young shooters"" but Duncan Robinson is 27, having only been in the league one year longer than Herro."
Tyler Herro
I still say the best thing to do is to hate trade him to Miami.   I can just see it now. Jimmy and Tyler Herro playing dodgeball with Simmons in the middle while Riley just looks on from the bleachers.
"Tyler Herros ceiling is an elite 6th man like a Jordan Clarkson. As for Kendrick Nunn he was a starter for most of the 20-21 season and would of won roty if he didn’t get covid (he finished 2nd in voting) I can see him being the better player potentially, he was also more consistent and more aggressive then Herro,and I think he’d have the better career starting with winning a chip (or 2) with Lebron in LA"
Let's not forget Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro singlehandedly took the 2020 Lakers to 6 games
"Kyle Lowry, Duncan Robinson, Oladipo, Jimmy Butler, Bam, Tyler Herro, PJ tucker.   What a squad"
"Personally, I think Coach Tyler Herro would be hilarious"
"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
"Lmao at least we MADE it to the finals. The tyler Herro obsession is so painfully obvious with you guys. He was snarlin’ all over yah ass 😂. Jayson Tanus is a straight scrub, and him getting blocked by Bam proved it. Enjoy another few decades of playoff irrelevance. You guys so trash your head coach Pete Buttigieg had to retreat into hiding in the front office. Lmaooo"
my guy you handed the Lakers the W with your old ass team made of glass &amp; tissue paper. now the entire league has Tyler herro downloaded &amp; you still wanna talk shit?
Tyler Herro is destined to get a full sleeve tattoo. Maybe even both arms. Only then will he truly break out. Until that offseason where shows up camp completely inked up he will never reach his peak.
who tf has slept on Tyler Herro 😂😂😂 foh one of the most hyped young players that got love from everyone
"I have zero expectations as to what Tyler Herro is going to talk about on media day. I didn't see his answer in context or even hear him speak it verbally. I just talked a mild amount of shit in a Reddit comment after seeing a quote that looked corny in print, because I was sitting in the back of an Uber and I was bored. I now intend to forget forever that he ever even said it, and it's certainly not anything I will ever hold against him   Reddit is just noise and I'm part of the problem"
"I just don't see him getting the minutes. He averaged 17 ppg in 34 mpg last year. He will be turning 36 years old and competing for minutes with Tyler Herro, Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo and then a slew of rotation guards.   Last year Butler played 34 mpg, Oladipo was at 28 mpg (recovering from injury so possibly expect an increase in mpg this year), Herro averaged around 31 mpg, and Vincent and Strus were around 13 mpg each in bench roles. Assuming he fills the Goran Dragic role (26 mpg) I'd be shocked if he averaged 15+ ppg. Even if he got more mpg, Miami has a lot of scoring options, I just don't see Lowry needing to score all that much.   Last year only 2 players averaged 15+ ppg at age 35+, they were LeBron James and Chris Paul. Lowry is great but he's obviously a tier or two below LeBron and Paul. Paul played 32 mpg last year and was also an All Star and All NBA 2nd team the past two years. Lowry as good as he is, is still a ways behind Chris Paul."
Is that true about wingspan growing as  you get taller?  Im just saying because I know people that have negative wingspans compared to their height. Like I saw a guy on Reddit say he was 6’9 with a 6’3 wingspan. Also Tyler herro is 6’5 with a 6’3 wingspan. Im not sure how wingspan and growing  height  work just saying some unique examples.
Tyler herro is enraged because he is the most recent self-proclaimed bucket from Kentucky
"""Bucket"" is the most annoying piece of NBA vernacular in the past few years, especially when everyone from Tyler Herro to rookies started getting the label"
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."
Trying to make Tyler Herro the primary ballhandler early last season.  So many turnovers..
"Yeah and that's stupid as hell. Tyler Herro is another example. He didn't have superstar potential, for various reasons (lack of elite athleticism/defense, some playmaking but mainly a pure sg, can't get a lot of points at the rim, etc), he just was lucky enough to be a really good rookie on a team wo made the finals. If you tought he had it, your fault. This season he really didn't regress. His shooting was a bit worse but I tought he improved his defense and playmaking. But just because he's a young socialite (not a bad thing) he's someone who doesn't focus on basketball.  **The original young socialite** is a totally different story, he deserves a lot of the slander"
"All young socialites get disrespected  Tyler Herro, Ben Simmons, and Kyle Kuzma are like 1st team disrespect"
"Nikeil Alexander Walker, Killian Hayes, Deangelo Russell (people know he’s good but he’s been passed around a lot because no one thinks they can win with him), Cam Reddish, Tyler Herro, Colin Sexton, Markelle Fultz."
Tyler Herro once he gets traded to a rebuilding team
"Trading to get Danny Green or Ingram back, maybe Tyler Herro."
"This question kind of reminds me of the Duncan Robinson vs Tyler Herro question last year (so after the finals). I think Maxey has the higher potential to become a multi-talented player in the league but exactly how productive his wider skillset will be is unknown atm. There have been many players exploding for a big scoring game and great showings, after all they're NBA players. Even end-of-bench guys are capable of scoring great numbers on singular nights, it's the consistency that decides your role in the league.  With that in mind I think Matisse Thybulle is set to be a vital piece on contending, championship-ready teams for his entire career. He literally only needs a solid catch and shoot 3 to be one of the best roleplayers in the league. His value is evident and a league that focusses on Superstars plus their sidekicks Matisse low demand on-ball is actually an advantage since your best player will hold the ball most of the time anyways if you're on an elite team. Those teams Matisse will enhance greatly with his concentrated skillset, a real x-factor type player poised for a long career in the league.   Right now I have doubts that Maxey will improve to the extent that his larger array of ""pretty good"" skills across the board will be of more use than Thybulle's isolated generational defensive talent if we're talking about teams that are in serious talks for a ring any given year. On a bad to average team you'd want Maxey but once you reach the top tier franchises an elite specialist will become better and better as they are ceiling raisers for teams that have great players for any demanded skillset already."
"Yep they’re not really taught any financial literacy, and they’re also famous so there’s yes men and fans everywhere. Look at Tyler Herro. He’s so absorbed with the fame signing autographs and he just knocked up his insta model gf, and he’s only made like $1.2mil."
Kevin huerter &gt; Tyler herro
That we shouldn’t trade Tyler herro for James harden lmao
Tyler Herro
"&gt; haliburton going through his ""rookie season kuzma"" or ""playoffs tyler herro"" on this sub, i see..  And Simmons is going through his ""I just shit my pants on the biggest stage in basketball and am now very publically forcing my way off my team"" stage, which is why his trade value is lower than Haliburton's."
"Hmmm so you literally have a set of morris twins and going to the 6 man which is Tyler Herro, you'll receive Joe Harris. Harris and Duncan are trouble."
yeahhh im sure you think that now lmao. Woud you have said that of the Tyler Herro 1 day after 2020 finals? Hell nah
"haliburton going through his ""rookie season kuzma"" or  ""playoffs tyler herro"" on this sub, i see... untouchable players"
"RJ Barrett will be a top 20 player, Tyler Herro will make an all-star team"
Trade him straight up for Tyler Herro.
Fuck dragic and fuck Jimmy butler and fuck Tyler herro and fuck Duncan robinson
Na g you just butt hurt. Tyler Herro is a boy. You probably thought you guys were going back to the final. Then next minute got bounce in the 1st round. Take the L
Tyler Herro is a boy. The fuck you talking about. You just sound like a butt hurt Jimmy Butler fan
"I thought everyone was saying that was tyler herro, with all that Tyrone Herro stuff."
I think he means Jack Harlow’s song called Tyler Herro. It was actually a pretty big hit
"Tyler ""Bubble Boy"" Herro"
"The right move is to trade Jimmy Butler to the Warriors for Wiggins, Wiseman, Minnesota pick, Warriors pick, and then shake them down for a future Warriors pick too.  The Heat have to ask themselves, can they build a better team than the Bucks or Nets in the next 2 years? If the answer is no, then move Jimmy, because once Jimmy starts getting to around 35-years old, he will start declining.   Something being overlooked is Jimmy is going to be a free agent next year. If he has another All NBA season you can expect him to opt out and secure one last big max deal. If his teammates are still poor next year outside of Bam, he might just leave Miami and they get nothing back.   Miami doesn’t have great options to improve the roster.  Because Bam took the extension instead of waiting, they only have around $25 million in cap space, well short of Kawhi’s max which will start at $39.2 million. This creates an awkward situation when it comes to acquiring him. Moving on from him, there other move is bringing in Kyle Lowry, at 35-years old, who could fall off a cliff any year, or being in someone like Lonzo or Markannen, and hope they don’t just steal your money.  They only can trade their 2028 draft pick and Tyler Herro has lost most of his trade value. There just aren’t good opportunities to upgrade the roster significantly to get on the Bucks / Nets levels, so they should move on from Jimmy’s timeline and move to Bam’s.  It’s unfortunate because Jimmy fits well with the franchise, but it’s the right move. The Heat should celebrate the two years and retire his Jersey for the contribution to the franchise, but it’s in both parties best interests for a breakup.  As for Jimmy, the Heat wouldn’t be doing him wrong. I’m sure he will be happy to get to compete for a championship with Curry and get to play with his friends from the 2016 Olympic team."
“We dont need harden. We have tyler herro”
Bryn Forbes is the new Tyler Herro and Tyler Herro is the new Bryn Forbes
"He got completely shut down, but his team didn't step up either for most of the series. It was a bad season and terrible series, Bucks are really good but I'm not ready to call it quits on this Miami team.  I was saying even last season that it was a perfect storm for them to make the finals and they aren't some truly great team...but they are definitely better than what we saw this season.   Plus when Jimmy came the plan was always to make a huge push this upcoming free agency. Tyler Herro hype got out of control, but Jimmy and Iggy were really impressed by his work ethic. I think both those guys' opinion holds weight with things like that and I'm excited to see if Tyler lives up to it this off season and makes the necessary improvements to his game."
"I mean, that’s still true. Tyler Herro is 21, way too early to give up on him"
Harden was under utilized on okc Duncan Robinson is going to be 28 next season and Tyler herro would rather just use the nba to make endorsement money
Never go full Tyler Herro
That’s literally tyler herro this playoffs with a better shooting % LOL
No James Harden trade because of Tyler Herro 🤧🤧🤧
Duncan Robinson played well game 1 then spent the rest of the series getting worked by Middleton all the time.  Tyler Herro was getting run with the garbage time crew...
"Uhh, yeah? Exactly? That is exactly what he should have done when he was being floated Harden and Lowry and said no because Tyler Herro had a couple good games in the bubble. Miami has crazy overvalued those two."
Jack Harlow and Tyler Herro name two more cringe people
Tyler Herro tricked y’all into thinking he was good!
"That's Tyler ""Bucket"" Herro to you"
how could you be so Tyler Herro
"The fact of the matter is Tyler Herro has the potential to become a key piece to a championship team, perhaps as important as somebody like Kyle Lowry is with the Raptors! - Jack Harlow"
The regression of Tyler Herro was massive and played a big factor to this series.
James Harden is nice but he's no Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro. Those two can be anything. They can even be the next James Harden.
Jack Harlow rethinking that time he spent making the Tyler Herro track now. Lmao
"*Finally, the last minute of the game*, thought Jimmy Butler as he received a quick inbound from his trusty big, Bam Adebayo. *This is where I excel.*      Jimmy dribbled down the court and glanced around at the mass of Heat fans cheering his name. He smirked and reached towards a small sack tied around his waist by a simple string. He dug his hand into the plump pouch and grab a hand full of its contents.      *South Beach sand.* He takes it everywhere he goes. Jimmy, while dribbling, brought the sand to his nose and wafed the smell. Ah yes! That smell! He could sense the gulf shore breeze in each granule. It was the perfect smell to remind him of his destiny, to be one with Heat culture. He dreamt of this moment.       He ritualistically blew the sand out of his palm and all over the NBA court; the crowd went **wild**. Jimmy then began squaring up his defender, Giannis Antetokounmpo from the Milwaukee Bucks. Giannis was a large man, that was certainly the case, but Giannis lacked one critical factor.      *Tyler Herro.* Jimmy quickened his moves. Right, left, right, left. Giannis had no chance. Butler approached the 3-point line and whipped the ball over to Herro, ready at the corner for the 3.       Routine catch-and-shoot from one of the bubble’s biggest breakout stars, Herro collected the pass with style and immediately jumped for the release. He flicked his iced wrist; tiny South Beach sand grains sprinkled out from underneath his fingernails.      *An S-tier release*, noticed Jimmy Butler. He gazed as the ball achieved a beautiful arc over the Bucks’ defense. Jimmy turned and began his shift to defense. *Herro had too much drip to miss--*      Clank!      Jimmy spun around to see that the ball had smacked the front of the rim and was hurtling toward him. He nabbed the ball, eyeing the shot clock. 14 seconds. They were down by 1. He squared up Giannis again. The sand he had previously blown onto the court was now crunching underneath his shoes. *Down to the wire*.   Sure, It was surprising to see that Herro had missed, but it didn’t matter anyway. The Heat just needed to bring Jimmy to the playoffs. They needn’t worry. He’ll handle the rest.      He darted towards the basket, worming his way around Giannis. Bucks’ center Brook Lopez slid into the lane. Jimmy juked outside, spun, and jumped. A mid-range attempt.      *I’m stupidly locked in.*      \[Game Ended. Milwaukee Bucks Defeat Miami Heat 4-0 in series sweep\]"
"Hot take:  Tyler Herro has elite skills.  Tyler Herro's on the wrong timeline for Butler.  Objectively speaking, they should have traded Herro if winning around Butler was paramount."
Damn can’t believe heat got swept. Do y’all think this will wake up Tyler herro or was he just a one and done type player.

The shoes were alright but they would literally look the same if the materials were fake, so the fact he requested to use real animal fur lets me know what an entitled asshole he is."
Everyone needs to chill on the Tyler Herro slander. It was Pat Riley and the Heat FO who made the decision not to make the potential trades for James Harden and Kyle Lowry
"Last year they had the untradeable Tyler ""*Better than MJ*"" Herro"
"Why do people think Tyler herro was what prevented harden from coming here, there was literally no shot he came to Miami"
It's only the people who don't actually watch or read up on basketball who keep mentioning this bountiful gift of Harden for Tyler herro and a couple Cuban sandwiches
Tyler Herro
The white Tyler herro
"These playoffs, Austin Rivers *is* better then Tyler Herro though"
Tyler herro bad
"dude, there is absolutely no shot that the Heat could’ve gotten Harden for a package centered around Tyler Herro and that narrative really needs to stop. I’m not even a heat fan either"
I think the Raptors won the Kyle Lowry/Tyler Herro trade
if tyler herro doesn't become jaylen brown level at bare minimum the trades that miami passed up on are gonna look not too great. people make fun of Boston for not trading Brown for paul george or butler so what are they gonna say about HERRO?
"“Tyler Herro, Guitar Hero, Super Hero, Hogan Hero... don’t matter, Bucks in fo’ “"
"Tyler Herro, Guitar Hero, Big Hero 6, idgaf, you gotta be willing to include the kitchen sink for Harden."
"It said ""Warrior Effect"" so Tyler Herro to the Warriors??"
Dude Harden doesn’t fit Heat culture like Tyler Herro bro you wouldn’t understand he’s just built different 😤.  /s
Jimmy Butler or Tyler Herro? Whose the bigger bubble fraud?
"The lighter version of Tyler Herro aka James Harden only had 40 last night, no big deal."
Tyler “Untouchable” Herro.
Yeah last season he had Bubble Tyler Herro
TYLER HERRO?! More like Tyler... Chump.

Tyler Herro 🤡🤡🤡
I forgot Tyler Herro was on the court.  Legit thought that was Dragic.
Never forget that Heats fans didn’t wanna trade Tyler Herro for James Harden because his ceiling was too high lol
"Bryan Forbes, what Tyler Herro aspires to be."
Maybe if the heat stadium play that Jack Harlow song it would wake up Tyler herro
I wanted Tyler Herro at the trade deadline but holy fuck he is so frustrating to watch

What is Tyler herro good at?
Tyler Herro bubble fraud
"Jimmy ""Bubble God"" Butler has been missing, Tyler ""Better than Harden"" Herro and Bam ""Giannis Stopper"" Adebayo has been doing good though"

"Tyler ""Better than Harden"" Herro has been doing good"
"Wisconsin is full of beer, and you don't throw beer in the trash can because Tyler Herro is too young to drink; therefore, Wisconsin isn't a trash can."

"You said “This isn’t about if Oladipo is better than KO...” but the post asked what is your favorite trade? Bud, my comment was *completely* about Oladipo being better than KO, otherwise why would that be my favorite trade?   What is funny to me, Neph, is that you didn’t answer the question (have you ever watched a full game of Oladipo on the pacers) even after I asked you three times 😂😂  What do you do in response? You look up all of Oladipo’s bad stats to try to “win” the argument. But you forgot what the argument was. As a young franchise with new players like Tyler Herro, Kendrick nunn, and bam adebayo, would you rather have KO or Oladipo?  The fact that you have yet to answer my original question completely defeats any argument you make because you keep dodging the question. I appreciate you trying, but I’m not gonna lie, after three comments, I am completely disregarding any basketball opinion you have.   It’s obvious you are a bit younger so all I will say is to keep your NBA opinions on Reddit, otherwise you will get made fun of when you spew dumb shit like this 🤣🤣😘"
ya ur right tyler herro is a superstar
No deal w/o Tyler Herro in it
Tyler Herro 🔥🔥🔥
Tyler Herro after Danny wanted him in that spot and the Heat snatched him hurt bad. Not that we would've stood a chance in the finals
"Damn since you put it that way head to head. Yeah, they are very very similar. Damn it seems like experiment 2.0 for Riley with Herro, since the one with Tyler didn't work out. Don't know about the Heat, heard on Jalen&amp;Jacoby that Kawhi might sign with the Heat this offseason. Maybe Butler, Kawhi, Bam might actually get them over the hump in the east?"
"Julius Randle, Tyler Herro, Bam Adebayo...are there any other Bubble Frauds I’m missing?"
Julius “Jimmy Butler” “Tyler Herro” Randle
It's scary how similar they are. I used this year for herro and Tyler 3rd season when he had breakout year.   https://stathead.com/tiny/07zPU
Shoutout Tj Warren and Tyler herro
"Yup, I don't what Riley was thinking when he gave Tyler Johnson that big contract? Herro I know can shoot and it's just like what KCP is going through right now, but man in order to earn that big first contract you have to keep that in the back of your mind."
"I have Miles Bridges as my #1, and Tyler herro is probably #2."
More games to come but right now I have Tyler Herro as number 1.
This Curry guy looks good in the Tyler Herro role.

As Tyler herro said “you can’t just compare me with white players”
Tyler Herro and the Heat are smart. I wish more guys would be open to taking that 6th man role. It's such a important role for playoff teams. You really need a bucket in those 2nd units. You're going to get more touches and more freedom under that role.
Tyler Herro would unironically invest in that
"yeah I think so  and they just maybe don't have the personnel for it  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K5zL86LaU0&amp;t=120s  heres another one where you have their center WCS up on the free throw line not affecting anything on this play, tyler herro just cuts in and embarrasses them.  everybody's watching the ball nobody is paying attention to herro.   luka in the low post doing nothing really  like the closest defenders to the rim here are the point guard, shooting guard and undersized small forward tim hardaway Jr"
"I’ll make this short: Tyler Herro isn’t and most likely will never be as good as either Luka or Trae.  However, his mentality and opinion that he is a peer to these great players is part of why he’s balling out now. No one needs to tell him to shoot the open shot (Lookin at you, Duncan)"
"Jesus Christ, it's ~~Jason Bourne~~ Tyler Herro..."
na somebody put the clip of Chuck being totally and utterly wrong about Tyler Herro
"I feel like that’s the move. Lowry still playing a lot because we want more than one ball handler on the floor and him and Herro take up that role for stretches with Jimmy and Bam sitting. When/if/hopefully Dipo comes back and is like 70% of the player he was, there’s a shot he take sup the load with Tyler in the second half"
"I love telling /r/nba I told you so.   I defended the Harden trade, I defended the sophomore slump, I defended the ""Im in the conversation"" chat.   Just rub these Tyler Herro #'s all over my body."

"Tyler Herro takes 5% of his shots within 3ft.  Embiid takes 16% of his shots from within 3ft (which is a career low, down from an average of 28%).  Herro takes 3 ft/game.  Embiid takes 10 ft/game.  You think these statistical profiles are identical.  Listen to yourself."

do u think the heat get like 3 all stars or do u think tyler herro takes one of bam or butlers spot

And that man's name? Tyler Herro
"Imagine starting the game with your 5 best players against the Heat. Now your Starters need rest and so does the Heat. But fucking Tyler Herro, Victor Oladipo and a Morris twin enter the game against your 15ppg bench."
"Its 7 games dude, it really doesn't matter at all.  Why not just ""Tyler Herro is averaging 22ppg/4ast/5.5reb on 45/39/85 shooting splits in 7 games this season. What a great start!""  That is far more impressive than some dubious nba record no one cares about.  Like some guy will see him in the streets in miami and be like ""woah hey everyone its the guy who was a 6th man for 7 games and scored the most points for a 6th man in 7 whole nba games"""
"I can't believe this narrative is still going on. Obviously Tyler Herro wasn't the deciding factor between us getting James Harden or not. They wanted literally every asset and piece of our bench that we had, we wouldn't have had a team if we did the trade.   Do you really think Pat Riley wouldn't have made that deal if it was just about Herro? As if guys on reddit know more than one of the best coaches/GM of all time lol."
Tyler Herro looks so good after having his first real offseason
"If you actually still think Pat Riley had the choice to trade for James Harden and didn't over Tyler Herro, I have a bridge to sell you. And I think Herro is an All-Star this season."
Is Tyler Herro in the same conversation as Luka and Trae?

Tyler Herro better than Luka unfortunately + ratio

Tyler Herro is a good young role player comparing himself to good young stars which is what you would expect of any nba player
"This Tyler Herro convo sounds like the ""can Klay be a #1 option on a contender"".  Doesn't mean Herro isn't valuable."
Yeah I doubt Chuck is a real big Tyler Herro fan lol
Fun fact Tyler Herro is 10th in the league in defensive win shares lol
Yall better apologize to Tyler Herro

Tyler Herro the next MJ
"you're joking..of course Mitch gets traded for prime Kareem. If you posted right now in the Knicks subreddit ""hey for some reason Denver wants to trade Jokic for Mitchell Robinson"" no shit every single person is going to say yes  a Tyler Herro for Lowry trade is one that Toronto wins, same goes when trading RJ Barrett for prime Jordan or Zach Lavine"
Meanwhile Tyler Herro actually played significant and meaningful minutes in the Finals...
I think Tyler Herro being hyped for his playoff bubble performance hurts his MIP chances. People overrate his past so they don't truly recognize his growth.     Also it looks to be a crowded field early.
"Your points are understandable. In response, He may have spoken his feelings after one game but that's not a reflection of just this game only. For the last couple seasons, Celtics fans have been complaining about playmaking on offense, play calling on offense and personnel. And on nights it works, it's not an issue and everyone's happy and when it doesn't, people get rightfully mad about it. The team is the same general makeup with a few subtractions and additions and when the same problems as usual come up, the same frustrations will too.  1. From a playmaking perspective, everyone we've had so far in the last 3 years is fine, passable but not terrific. This includes Kyrie, Kemba, the Jays and everyone else. Hayward was generally excluded from this as our best passer along with Horford but Horford left and Hayward was never fit. They Jays have improved on this aspect, yes, but not enough. When they struggle to get a shot, as you can see often from whenever Aaron Nesmith or Pritchard got the ball last year, or even lobs to Rob Williams, the pass is just a bit off. Enough that they can't go straight up and shoot it off the passes.  2. Play calling/offense. It's a lot of isos or 2 man screen game if any. It's a lot of your turn, my turn kind of offense and when it works, it's great. I'll throw it back to something Brad hammered home in our NBA finals year without kyrie. Paint touches. It's something from the eye test, no numbers to prove, to me that has decreased a by some amount. We worked hard that year to get it to Horford inside so we can get the ball outside more. And that has gone down as the Jays have gotten more involved with the offense. We still do run some cool stuff to run those kind of looks with Al now and at times with Rob Williams last season. We couldn't with Tristan Thompson with his stone hands and not as much with Kanter due to him being better off trying to score when he gets the ball. We can't really do that with Grant Williams because when he's at center, he's not in the pain often, as we play a 5 out of sorts. And when Tatum posts up, he's looking for one thing only and it's not to pass it out. We can definitely get better with that with our current personnel and we should but there needs to be gradual changes in that too.  3. Personnel. He's not always the problem. And its absolutely too soon to dislike it. Watching Josh Richardson has been pain so far. Some more Nesmith would be nice but I imagine he's not playing a lot for a reason. I'll choose to believe in Ime for now. We haven't had an out and out shooter for a while. None comes to mind. Could've been Tyler herro but Miami got to him in the draft first. And he's since shown to be more than that anyways. Wasn't Carson Edwards. Isn't Nesmith quite yet. So the who are they passing to criticism is fair, but obviously if trying to be solo offense isn't working and is costing us wins, then fucking pass even if they suck.   We suck at rebounding this season so far. Getting progressively worse every year. 21st in the league this season, 14th last season, 11th and 10th the 2 seasons before that.  Etc. Could go on. Don't want to be too much of a downer.   TL:DR Basically, things could be better. Smart isn't only frustrated about this game only and he isn't necessarily wrong either. And it isn't solely the Jays at fault. But it's fixable, and hopefully will be asap. I would rather be celebrate than bitching."
"Because people are putting money on it, this is literally just the betting odds. Pretty sure bookies aren't going to say 'No, sorry, we can't take your bet on Tyler Herro winning MIP - it's only been six games it's too irresponsible.'"
"Certified Celtic Slayer, Tyler Herro."
the celtics haven’t been the same since tyler herro fucked them over
"It tears me apart to be a fan of both, i started watching miami cause of jimmy but those fuckers just had to grow on me, tyler herro is insane so far this year"
Yep. The moment I lost hope in the Jays was when Tyler Herro took a dump on them in the Playoffs.
"I also came to say Tyler herro, although miles bridges has also been ballin"
Just came to say Tyler Herro
"Tyler Herro is a beast, that said though Luka will get back into it, not worried."
Luka is as good as Tyler Herro this year
"Obviously hindsight is 20/20 but those Sacramento and Memphis picks had a lot more speculative value than actual. They were one pick away from Tyler Herro and when you look at who was drafted afterwards no real candidate steps out.  That being said, we can totally shit on Ainge for taking Grant Williams over Matisse Thybulle (see above post for that whole debacle)"
Buying a Tyler Herro jersey is basically part of the initiation
"Romeo’s pick at 14 was a SAC/MIA tiebreaker coin flip away from becoming the 13th pick, which would’ve been Tyler Herro instead.  I will never not think about this when Romeo Langford’s name is mentioned.  (he was also the pick Philly traded us with Tatum’s 3rd pick in exchange for Fultz at 1)"
Tyler Herro would like to have a word
Tyler Herro probably
Tyler Herro
Also drive Tyler Herro into the middle of nowhere.
Luka doing his best to include Tyler herro in the conversation this year.
I think Melo could become a 6MOY candidate if he keeps playing like has. Only thing stopping him from winning is probably tyler herro
"I feel like he's a mid level number one option, higher level 2 guy.   I feel like he would pair with a guy Tyler herro well.   Tyler isn't a true ball handler, but can playmake."
There’s more than this but Tyler Herro &amp; Desmond Bane
"Herro plays 4th quarters so we ignore the other 3?   And we count stats at larger sample sizes because its more indicative of their actually play vs a 6 game sample size. If we just count numbers and use your logic of using a 6 game sample size they Tyler Herro is better than James Harden since he has a higher DBPM, higher ppg, higher fg%, higher 3p%, and higher ts%"
nah man duncan robinson and tyler herro are top 20 defenders now /s
"&gt; -Jimmy Butler currently leads the league in Defensive Win Shares, followed closely by Bam Adebayo at No. 4. Tyler Herro (17), Kyle Lowry (18) and Duncan Robinson (19) all sit within the Top 20.  - Jimmy Butler currently leads the league in Defensive Points Saved at +21.59. Bam Adebayo is No. 6 at +8.81.  These are literally just stats that look at team defensive rating and mostly assign credit based on minutes played  Defensive Win Shares is not even a useful stat OVER MULTI-SEASON STRETCHES. Absolutely kills me when people use it for like 6 games lol"
"The year is 2065, the heat in a blowout victory bring off Tyler herro III for udonis haslem with 20 seconds left, gets ejected"
Got offered Tyler Herro for Carmelo Anthony. 😎
Tyler Herro is not going under any kind of radar. Every good game he has this season has gotten so much attention
"Tyler herro made that ""I'm in the same conversation as Luka, Trae, Tatum"" comment, got clowned for it and said ye aight watch this"
Tyler Herro would like a word
Dejounte Murray close to averaging a Triple Double (17.5/8.5/8.8). Tyler Herro averaging 22z
Tyler Herro is 6'5 with a 6'3 wingspan and Jimmy is 6'7 with a 6'8 wingspan and Jimmy has a way better defensive IQ than Tyler.
"Man, you wasted my time for something I already could see. Tyler Herro has made the leap this year as far as PPG and Barrett is tracking nearly identical FT, FG, Assist as last year. For Barrett to be a bigger player he doesn’t average much more rebounds than Herro which is shocking to add."
"He's more along on the defensive end than Tyler Herro is what I'm saying. I'm not going to get into comparing him to other players, just Tyler Herro."
It's pronounced Tyler Herro
Tyler herro looks like a 15 year old in a NBA player frame
Hello? 911? Tyler Herro is trying to beat me up.
But also because Heat fans are fuckin obnoxious about Tyler Herro. Duncan Robinson? He doesn’t get the same weird kind of love so I take no umbrage lol
Wait what's wrong with being a Tyler Herro fan? He's playing really well this year...
"Heat pretend to be hardcore but have Morris playing dirty, kyle Lowry flopping everywhere, Tyler herro snarling while down 3-1 in a series, and Butler making everything about him that might be biggest collection of soft I've seen in quite some time. Bam is cool though"

I’ll make a business decision like Tyler Herro
"The Morris Brothers have always been bitches imo, of course Jokic is going to do that he's real as fuck.  I love that *tyler herro heat player* walks up to him like he's going to do aaaaaanything also haha"

"Oh no, Ben Simmons is about to pull a Tyler Herro on us."
His peer like Tyler herro?
"Tyler Herro saying he should be in the same category as Luka ,Trae , etc."
NBA finalist Tyler Herro
I respect the Tyler Herro pick too. He was second for me after Jordan Poole. Herro averaged 25 throughout the first three pre season games and we all know what happens if he gets more possessions per game. He’s truly a bucket and could score in a variety of ways from the mid range. He’s got an elite floater too which always helps freeze defenders. I could see Herro being in the convo for 6th man.
"After preseason I will go with Tyler Herro.  With bias, as a Heat fan"
Tyler Herro albinism confirmed?

So he wants to be in the same conversation as Tyler Herro?
Yeah and Tyler Herro looked like a top 5 player in the league in the bubble.
lol Tyler Herro is more of a Kuzma then even a Ja; let alone Luka and Trae.
"When I see Luka play, I immediately think to myself ""man, this guy's just as good as Tyler Herro""."
"Tyler Herro is all like... ""see how I'm in the conversation!"""
"Hey now, Tyler herro and Duncan Robinson are corner stones. You turn down that trade ten times out of ten."
Tyler herro is obviously violating the nba drug policy.
I love learning new things in the depths of some Tyler Herro shitposting
"Same conversation like, “I’ll trade Luka for Tyler Herro and 5 first round draft picks”"
I mean we have 0 idea what a Tyler Herro given the keys to a franchise like those other stars would look like. Who knows? Might be a different story once Tyler grows more as an NBA player and Jimmy/Lowry are on their full way to retirement. Could definitely see Herro/Bam be a great centerpiece for an organization like Miami if he continues to get better. Sophomore slump happens to a lot guys but typically 3rd year is where you see marked improvement. Just give it time and we'll make a decision on it later  But even so there's levels to this Luka / Trae / Ja / Herro and there's a good drop off between each tier in my opinion.
"Yeah, if the conversation is, ""Which players are way, way better than Tyler Herro"""
"*Luka, Trae, Ja and Tyler Herro walk into a bar...*"
" I heard that Tyler Herro gets dressed just like Luka and Tre, so this could be also true"
"He just turned himself into a league laughingstock with that remark, like I get having confidence in yourself, but that kind of comment is just going to be meme'd to death every time he plays like Tyler Herro."
"I went to school with Tyler Herro, he was a freshman when I was a senior"
"He is if the conversation starts with; “which young players are way better than Tyler Herro, like ones he is not even close to?”"
The amount of people around here that didn't want their team to trade for Harden last year is far too high. Tyler Herro was apparently too high a price...
"""Who all was drafted in 2018 and 2019?""   ""Oh, you know... Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Ja Morant...""   ""Tyler Herro?""   ""Uh, yeah... him too.."""
1. Luka  2. Trae  3. Tyler Herro  4. Everyone else
I don’t think ‘Tyler Herro didn’t peak in his rookie year’ is a bad take and I have no issue with dying on that hill.
Jordan Poole &gt; Tyler Herro
"“There’s Tyler Herro once again getting beat off the dribble by Trae, Luka, etc”"
"Watch out. This sub fawns over hEaT cUlTuRe. You’ll get banned if you say anything negative about them, like how since Lebron left, in 7 years they were only able to attract one star free agent (butler). This despite having no state tax and beautiful water. And hEaT cUltUre.   Or how they made terrible contracts with whiteside and tyler johnson, to have to trade them for peanuts to get out of them.   Or how they disrespected their most iconic player to the point he was willing to go to Chicago to get away.   Or how they continue to pay a man who hasn’t been able to contribute as a player in over 5 years to warm the bench instead of making him a coach. And this same man, who has barely started for the team, will have his jersey retired.   Or how they retired the number 23 for Jordan, you know, a player who’s never played for them.   Or how they refused to trade for JAMES HARDEN because the rockets wanted TYLER HERRO.   hEaT cUlTuRe tHo"
"And that's Tyler Herro and Tyler Herro's mom, respectively."
"Or ""Tyler Herro is nowhere near as good as Doncic, Young or Morant"""
Lmao literally nobody in the NBA cares if you or I or *anyone* who is not a professional basketball player/coach/manager thinks that Tyler Herro doesn’t know basketball as much as he should 🤣
Tyler Herro redemption arc
Alexa play Tyler Herro by Jack Harlow
I think there's a far leap from Joe Blow at YMCA insisting he could be on the Lakers to Tyler Herro saying he's part of the young up-and comers and can be an all-star in the league one day
"Casual nba fan that knows nothing. I know the other 3 pretty well, I have no clue who Tyler Herro is"
Tyler Herro is the black version of Wayne Brady
"High: Was a fan of these players before they got drafted and often wondered why they werent picked a bit higher.   Dwyane Wade, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins, Deandre Jordan, Andre Iguodala, Danny Granger, Paul George, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, 	   Domantas Sabonis, Tyler Herro, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tyrese Haliburton.   &amp;#x200B;  Wrong: I thought these players would be pretty good before the draft.  Marcus Williams, Ben McLemore, Rodney Stuckey, Chris Douglas-Roberts, Earl Clark, Wesley Johnson, Kévin Séraphin, Andrew Nicholson, Nerlens Noel, Rashad Vaughn, Justin Patton, Wendell Carter Jr., Goga Bitadze.'Too soon, but I was high on Jalen Smith, Zeke Nnaji."
Guess I’m a Tyler Herro fan now.
"I agree.  Part of jordans coolness was the long shorts.  He changed the fasion of the league.  That and the shoes.  The leader in shoes the last decade has been lebron.  I don’t know who is responsible for bringing back short shorts.  First I remember is kent bazemore.  Now rugrats shorts are popular, maybe thats tyler herro, idk."
Tyler Herro. Vax hero!
Because a singular post season shouldn’t determine your entire perception of a player.  It’s why people were insisting Tyler Herro was an overpay for James fucking Harden lol.
I want to hate Tyler Herro for going to UK but he just always makes me like him more. Dude's a straight shooter with upper management written all over him.
1. Edwards - finished the 2nd half of last season strong and has a coach that can utilise him properly  2. Tyler Herro - he had a down year last year after all the bubble hype and will have a bounce back year playing with his new teammate Kyle Lowry  3. SGA - has the green light on a poor Thunder roster   4. Mo Bamba - has showed a lot of promise in the preseason so far   5. Miles Bridges - will take another step and get great looks playing with Lamelo  6. Michael Porter Jr - he showed what he can do after Murray went down and he became the second option behind Jokic
"""huh...this tyler herro isn't so bad ...yet"""
After all the craziness we are seeing I guess Tyler Herro is my new favorite player now.
Tyler truly is a Herro
Tyler truly is a Herro
"I mean, Tyler Herro is definitely up there in terms of r/nba 's punching bags but he's not number 1."
I hate a lot of Tyler Herro stuff but I like this.
YA HEAA THAT BOYS?   CANCEL THAT CANCELLATION. GET YA TYLER HERRO JERSEYS HEAAAAA
"What???? Y'all either didn't make the playoffs or lost in the first round of a weak Eastern conference 5 of the last 7 years. You made it to the mickey mouse championship off of a freak Tyler Herro performance and got wrecked by a Lakers team that couldn't shoot threes. Successful franchise, sure. Best franchise? Not even fucking close."
"Meanwhile, the comments on their pro-vaxx social media posts are all along the lines of 'who's paying you to do this?'. 'tyler herro has been compromised' etc."
Wow I’ve really been wondering what Tyler Herro has had to say during these times....Jesus Christ
"I see Tyler Herro, I upvote."
Do I like Tyler Herro now?
"What the fuck, I love Tyler Herro now"
"Quotes from Tyler Herro saying “my family is vaccinated, I think it’s good,” are not necessary IMO"
Tyler Herro vs RJ Barret is back on the menu!
Even Tyler Herro's ceiling is lower than Bubble Tyler Herro
"Trae wins mvp  Jrue holiday wins DPOY  Tyler Herro (as much as I can’t stand him, he’s just balling right now) wins 6MOTY  Kyrie never gets vaccinated and bucks somehow beats them in a very close game 7 which causes Kyrie to get traded and then he retires.   Bucks vs Nuggets in finals"
Westbrook experiment ends with him getting traded or at the back of the rotation  Tyler Herro 6th man of the year  Miami Heat NYK for the ECF   Nets 1st round playoff exit   CP3 traded for Simmons and it some how involves Ayton and Tobias Harris
Bubble Tyler Herro
Grayson Allen literally was a starter on a playoff team averaging 16 PPG on incredible efficiency when getting minutes lol. He’s literally better than Tyler Herro.   Lowry is proven to be dogshit in the playoffs.
"Everyone hates him but Tyler Herro is gonna be in the running for 6moty, he had a predictable sophomore slump after a short turn around and a lot of health and covid problems last year. But dude can put up 25+ any night"
What’s up Tyler Herro?
i wish i was steph curry or tyler herro

I didn't say anything about Tyler Herro.

"We need to reclaim this as a ""You just lost to"" meme. If we are the bubble Guppies then what does that make the teams that dont beat us?   Real talk though our team got to those finals because of many factors coming together. If I were to name a few, Duncans breakout shooting year, Tyler and (to a lesser extent purhaps )Kendricks amazing Rookie campaigns. Bam making a major leap to All-Star level Center, and Jimmy turning on god mode.  Another big part was Goran Dragics elite scoring and playmaking abilities. Last season the limited offseason took its toll on the players both physically and mentally and I think one of the most notable ones was Goran. Of course he wasnt the only one, what woth general decreased effort, herros struggles in his sophmore season, losing Crowder, ect.   But now that we have Lowry, We have regained the missing skills Goran contributed and more as Kyle also is an amazing defender and his outlets seem to really drive our teams pace.   We also got a guy with elite defense at the 4 which was what crowder brought us 2 seasons back and was another key element we were missing last year. Arizais a great defender of course and did his best but didnt have the strength we needed at the 4 position.  And Tyler Herro has effectively reclaimed the high volume scoring 6th mam spot that him amd dragic gave us in the19-20 season.  Dedmon and Morris are solid backups at the big man positions and im very glad we got them and the end of bench huys like Martin, Vincent, Yurtseven, give is great histle when they get thier chances.   Oberall this team has been exciting and its too early to get our hopes up too much but whay weve seen is very impressive and that makes it hard not to get our hopes up."
"I said his way before the season started and when I read about the rule change, Trae is gonna have a really hard time putting up those numbers every night. His ppg have gone down his TOs have gone up and now that defenses are allowed to actually play him he is gonna be much less effective. I’m sorry but Trae is the worst fouls baiter in the NBA and unless he shoots the lights out he will be just an above average scorer like Tyler Herro"
"He killin my multi-bet for him to win most improved and patty to win 6MOY..   Tyler Herro looks like he'll get both tho.  Edit: Herro averaging 7 rebs, damn son."
"With 6MOY candidate Tyler Herro, absolutely."
Tyler Herro is legit a 6MOTY front runner right now
Trae just carried his team to the ECF  Tyler Herro has played 5 good games  It's not even a discussion bro
Tyler Herro not looking so crazy saying he was in the same convo as Luka and Trae so far this year?
Bro I can’t believe you haven’t seen people hating. The Tyler Herro stans have been out in full force after he started out hot this season.
Imagine this were Tyler herro or thybulle this would be a much bigger story
Tyler herro.
"Yeah they couldn’t get open and were taking contested jumpers. Last year we also had Nunn and dragic to at least drive and her bam and jimmy open we don’t anymore, so when Lowry goes down we start bum ass Gabe Vincent. Watch the fucking games he’s insanely valuable that herro buzzer beater only happened because of Lowry, if you watched you’d see Lowry yelling at Tyler to stay in the back court with him. If you watch these games you’d see Lowry all the time doing this and setting up our offense which is why it was so bad when he was out. You can say poor shooting which it was but you’re leaving out the context that jimmy and bam were constantly shooting jumpers."

"Tyler herro also looks like a real hard worker. Always making the hustle plays, playing the ""right"" way. Kyle lowry now, very athletic, some may even say, genetically athletic."
Strange 🤔 I always had the impression that Duncan Robinson was very intelligent. A true cerebral player. Now Tyler Herro on the other hand…
"His stats look like shit, but that's largely because  A) he's mainly just creating tons of chaos on the offensive end through touchdown passes that end up being hockey assists once more pieces come up-court  B) defensive stats (aside from BPG/SPG) aren't really found in the box score  There's something to be said about how Miami's starting 5 defensive scheme can now reliably switch **everything** because of how good Lowry is on defense. Not like, Jrue Holiday good, but he's able to keep up on the perimeter, guard guards in the post (he even guarded Miles Bridges in the post tonight on multiple occasions and was a reliable defender there) and has the IQ to communicate with our other 3 defensive stalwarts in Jimmy/Bam/PJ.   He's also somehow managed to, in short order, impart wisdom onto Tyler Herro and turn him into a reliable bench playmaker of sorts. It's **wizardry**. If 3yr/$75m is what it costs to get this much value and nearly nothing in the box score, I'm completely for it."
Tyler Herro 6MOTY is gonna make me so much money 😂😂. I am Lakers fan but man do i want Tyler herro to have 50 point games against us.
Tyler Herro is the type of guy to take a screenshot of all the hate comments on his insta and read it before every game for motivation.
"this heat defense + kyle lowry getting into rhythm on offense will be a serious contender to make it out of the east. i’m not sure they aren’t already a real contender man, they made us look like kids at times. Bam is legit, Jimmy is legit, Tyler herro killed us. I will say, the hornets 2 years ago or even last year would have absolutely just given up. glad to see the team actually have some fight up until the end. GG Heat, y’all earned that."
Tyler Herro is my dad.
I'm being offered 5x what I put in to cashout my 6MOTY Tyler Herro bet
Tyler Herro is a fucking bucket
tyler herro
Apologize to Tyler Herro
Warriors have the best seating. Miami has the best bench player in Tyler Herro. Knicks have the best bench mob.
tyler herro cant finish at the rim
Wait is Tyler herro actually that guy wtf
"I don't mind them waiting until the trade deadline, but they better actually buy him out if they don't get the ransom they are demanding.  Last trade deadline, Raptor's fans delusionally thought they deserved Tyler Herro for Lowry who was obviously going to leave in free agency for free."
"As much as I love Tyler, they won't. Tyler will be in a 6th man role this year. Duncan needs to be in the starting lineup as an off ball player and he also provides more spacing than Tyler Herro. If Duncan is not on the line up Max Strus will probably be in, as Herro still needs to save energy to be the primary ball handler + scorer on the second unit  Just look at the defence when he goes for a DHO, they're doubling with a hand up and also pulling jerseys so he won't get a shot off lol"
Tyler herro is playing better then Harden this year (off the bench)
I got ALL the Tyler Herro receipts saved on this sub. Y’all fucked
"Because it’s the Heat AND a Tyler Herro highlight, this will not make it to the front page."
"Tyler Herro has very quickly turned into an elite pick and role operator. Doesn’t get flustered, won’t turn it over too often and usually either finds a nice look for himself or a teammate. Very McCollum-like."
you didn't trade for JAMES HARDEN because of tyler fucking herro   don't talk to lakers fan about overrated assets.
I’ve watched KPJ for years it’s why my opinion on him is so so he hasn’t changed much over the course of years. Same reason he dropped we behind Tyler in draft rankings is the same reason Herro stills performs better to this day.
"Do you think him sleeping on a couch or only eating canned soup impacted Tyler Herro? If Haslem were 15 years younger, do you think doing that would've made him play better?"
"Thought I was going to retire the name “Swaggerless Tyler Herro” after the playoffs, but I guess not."
"Michael Beasley bar none, Tyler  Herro fans are doing their best effort but I won’t let them this time."
"A lot of people are looking good defensively due to low sample size.  Min 25 possessions (DeAndre hunter has defended 46) DeAndre hunter is 51st out of 224 players in PPP. Compared to DeAndre hunters .739 ppp, number one is Luke Kennard at .226 ppp on 31 possessions. Poeltl is 199th at 1.095. Tyler herro, Duncan Robinson and demar derozan all in top 20 lowest PPP. Harden 25th. It's just crazy rn."
White 12 year olds boys who wear shooting sleeves to school ruined Tyler Herro
Terrance “Tyler “Kyle kuzma” herro” mann
Is Kevin Huerter this year’s Tyler Herro or is he better?
Where’s Tyler Herro
What's the bet he's the new Tyler Herro?
Had to switch to the flair but:  Ben Simmons is undoubtedly the most overrated player I’ve ever seen and I root for a team with Tyler Herro on it
Tyler Herro don't got a $200 million contract
Tyler herro
Kevin huerter is who Tyler Herro thinks he is
Is this new ginger kid new Tyler Herro?
Huerter looking like a Bubble Tyler Herro out there
Trae young or Tyler herro heat fans?
Wait when did Tyler herro start playing for the 76ers
Yeah I feel like I'd be so much more bitter if D'Antoni and Morey weren't gone and it wasn't obvious it was time for a rebuild anyways.  Also it's so hard not to be defensive when you see these nonsense Tyler Herro &gt;&gt; Harden hot takes at the start of the season.
"His arms are not short, his wingspan is 6’8  You must be thinking of Tyler Herro who’s also 13th pick of the draft who has a 6’3 wingspan  Booker and Herro at same height 6’5"
Are any of those players you listed  1 and done prospects? Tyler Herro may act hip but he is very much white.
"I think it’s safe to say at this point, Giannis Ugo Antetokounmpo &gt; Tyler Herro"
"Forced how? KD and Kyrie were free agents. Harden definitely forced his way ""out* of Houston but didn't demand to go to Brooklyn. Houston's owner refused to deal with Philly and Miami was dumb enough to value Tyler Herro over James Harden."
Tyler Herro sighs in relief.
Tyler Herro&gt; Frauden
In the first round against Miami when guarded by Tyler Herro.
Spo sold us on Tyler Herro ffs
"Never forget after last year's bubble a Twitter poll had the majority of 10,000+ people picking Tyler Herro over Paul George. One of the worst opinions I have ever heard was sort of mainstream among NBA fans."
Bruh we did this with Tyler Herro last season
So did Tyler herro
tyler herro 2.0?
Tyler Herro vibes
"Who would you rather have, Tyler Herro or Terrance Mann?"
Mann is this year's Tyler Herro
More like the next Tyler Herro tbh

"""Look at me, I am Tyler Herro now"""
Surry play Tyler Herro
trae young is what the heat think tyler herro is
It's aite man at least you guys still got future FMVP tyler herro.
"Okay fair - I think I just got caught because the con you listed for Donte was 'not good' and Tyler just got 'arms too small'. For what it's worth Donte's 3-point shot has made big leaps each season (.265/.336/.379) and he has Jrue as a mentor so I only see his defense getting even better.   I think in terms of value as a starter it's roster dependent - if you've already got a variety of good scoring options (like the Bucks, or Brooklyn) then Donte is a worthwhile starter where Herro is not, if that's not the case then I can see the other argument though I definitely think that Herro's better offense is dramatically overstated. Feels like a lot of people are counting on a post-season performance from Herro that happened in unusual circumstances and has yet to be replicated. Herro regressed where Donte never did, and the latter has picked up a genuinely impressive ability to hunt rebounds (especially offensive rebounds) in the latter half of the season."
"&gt; Donte is an okay team defender and a below-average shooter  I'd argue that Donte is far better than an 'okay' team defender, but if he is then what does that make Herro? On shooting the difference between them is a career difference of 0.01 TS%, with the same difference this season - so again, if Donte is a below-average shooter, what does that make Herro? *Yes* he popped off in last years playoffs, but that's not been replicated.  &gt; on a team that already tried replacing him before being rejected at the last minute by the league.  The choice isn't Donte or Bogdanovic, it's Donte or Herro.  &gt; If he wasn't on a stacked team surrounded by all-stars, he wouldn't be starting.  We had one all-star appearance on the team this year, which Miami would've matched had Jimmy Butler not been injured at the start of the season. Ignoring that though, if Tyler Herro is on the Bucks instead of Donte is he starting? If he is then this isn't much of an argument, if he's not then it says Donte's better. The question isn't 'Is Donte a good starter' it's a 'Would you rather X or Y'."
"Harden made a bunch of 2nd string Nets player go on an 8 win streak by beating teams like  Clippers,Lakers,Suns etc.  People just don't realize how much attention he receives on defense plus how amazingly underrated his playmaking ability is because he knows how to exploit that.Heat fans really screwed NBA fans out of a Harden vs Giannis series. That's the real upsetting news, not how incompetent their FO is for keeping Tyler Herro.   EDIT: To answer your question. That Miami team is winning a chip with Harden, Butler and Bam."
"Have you watched much of either of their games? For honesty I've only seen Tyler Herro when he's played against the Bucks but stats don't support Herro being a better passer.  Per 36 numbers favour Donte hugely, negligible difference on points per FGA (1.16 vs 1.14), negligible difference on assists (4.1 vs 4.0) while Donte gets more rebounds (7.5 vs 6.0), more steals (1.4 vs 0.8) and less turnovers (1.8 vs 2.2). Donte is also a great defender, and the fact that Herro is a little better scorer is kinda moot given how many extra possessions Donte generates for his team.  Again, not seen that many Herro games and it'd be unfair to judge only based on the ones I have given that those have been the playoffs. But to trade off a far better defensive performance, extra team possessions for... 0.01% better TS% at a higher volume? I don't see it."
Tyler Herro would be lucky to average 14PPG in China.
"The Heat didn't want to move for him because they wanted to hold onto Tyler Herro LMAOOOO  If you can get Harden and it doesn't cost you another top 5 guy or young top 10 guy, why the hell wouldn't you do it??"
"I don’t think they’ll move Tyler herro, and I think everyone’s overreacting because that’s what Reddit does. Regardless, Riley is not about to move a player he valued highly when the player’s market is at an all time low. He’s not leaving."
"A lot easier to play more minutes guarding Tyler "" Can't find the Ocean"" Herro than Kyrie..."
"Simply put, Jimmy is not having a good series. Jrue Holiday has been the difference… as Bledsoe isn’t there to give the heat some possessions off this time around.  I hate the direction this team took letting Kelly, Bradley, Crowder (started last postseason) go and putting too much value in Tyler Herro. He should’ve been a part of a Harden, Beal, or even a Vucevic type offer this season.  Oladipo would’ve made a little difference on offense, but Bucks traded the assets necessary and it shows."
I think having Lebron and AD makes it easier to recover on the court as opposed to having Tyler Herro and Bam who are two young guys who've just faced the first situation of being expected to play at an all star level in the NBA.
"It's Pat Riley's fault for thinking Tyler ""Snarl Boy"" Herro is better than James Harden lol"
The heat did not turn down a trade for James harden. This is false. There is absolutely no way Pat Riley turns down Harden if he’s available he has a long track record of trading everyone on the team for a star in their prime if available.  This is the narrative that was put out because a deal was not reached.  Obviously the rockets were after 1st round picks (just look at the package they went with) and the heat had exactly 0 first round picks is why the deal didn’t get done. Not because the heat thought Tyler herro was better than James harden.
tfw you make precious achuiwa and tyler herro untouchable for harden and lowry trades
Imagine not wanting to trade Tyler Herro for Harden lmao
"He balled out in the bubble but did they seriously want to keep Tyler Herro over James Harden?! Harden on the heat would’ve made them favourites, that’s an amazing trio.   Sixers wanting to keep Simmons made sense but Heat.. what is you doing"
"Tyler Herro - He had a good playoff run whilst being young, gets a lot of hype. Scorers naturally get more hype too. People were high on him but now kinda regret it seeing as how he slowed down a bit this year.  Jayson Tatum - Compared to Jaylen, he came out first, jaylen's kinda living in his shadow. BI plays for the pels, he'd probably get a lot more hype if he was somehow still on the Lakers. Jayson also has big games and people remember those more.  Ben Simmons - Generational talent that could be much better if he somehow learned to shoot better, there's nothing wrong with people saying he's good but at the same time he could be much better if he could shoot which has impacted their playoff run  Andre Drummond - AKA Big penguin. He plays on the Lakers, obviously backlash is going to be a little more overblown. But i mean he clogs the lane when both the stars play, he's meh when he comes to stopping the PnR the Suns run. He also has like 0 offence and bricks when its not a dunk or a layup under the bucket."
"So what you're saying is...   Tyler Herro is the next Michael Jordan.  Ben Simmons is garbage.  Jayson Tatum is the greatest of all time and he's only 19.  Drummond is Drummond.    In all seriousness, all I'm saying is some of these players get too much love while others get too much hate. Maybe it's justified and I'm just not really seeing why..."

Tyler Herro can no longer be Austin Rivers with Instagram followers. Too disrespectful to Rivers.
Tyler Herro of the West.
I know it was reported but I still don't believe that the Heat let Tyler Herro hold up a Harden trade
"I really hope there isn’t any truth to them not going after James Harden, because they didn’t want to trade Tyler Herro. Then, I would feel *very* bad for them."
"He might have a shot if Tyler ""Snarl Boy"" Herro and Bam ""Giannis Stopper"" Adebayo shows up"
"Riley did the same thing a couple of years ago. The team overachieves and so he chugs the kool-aid, ends up making stupid decisions like paying James Johnson, Dion Waiters, Tyler Johnson, Whiteside, etc. and then they fall down to earth.  Dude didnt even entertain a Herro trade for Harden even tho his best player is 31."
"Jesus christ im done with this.   You're either deliberately trolling or genuinely know nothing about the subject.  Robinson and Nunn having played in the G league does not mean we'd be able to replace their value with another G league player. Iggy is still good for the Heat in his role, and yeah, Precious is the worst player of the trade but he's still a decent young asset. There's also Tyler Herro and Kelly Olynyk.  Having actual NBA quality players on your roster is important, having a team stacked at the top supported by trash isnt winning anything.   This is my last comment in reply to you"
It’s more believable than when Tyler Herro did it
Devin “Tyler Herro” Booker
"Bucks Heat. I mean, yeah, theyre both gonna be sweeps but at least Tatum is trying and Robert Williams makes me jealous as a Nets fan. And theyre down a huge piece, so its understandable why we”re bonking the Celtics. What the fuck is the Heats excuse?  Also, as an aside, if this sweep happens, the Tyler Herro Harden poll is gonna be the best part about the Heats season lmao"
Tyler “Devin Booker” Herro
&gt;Tyler Herro is a goldfish in a bag pat riley's kid bought at disneyland
He’s LA Tyler herro
Tyler Herro
Kyle Kuzma doing his best Tyler Herro impression
Imagine not trading tyler herro for james harden
"Do you remember Tyler ""who is MJ?"" Herro last playoffs LMFAO"
"Tyler ""Triple Single"" Herro"
"Tyler ""wouldn't trade him for Harden, anyway - Heat fans"" Herro"
"Tyler ""wouldn't trade for Lowry"" Herro"
"Yea y’all could’ve. They wanted Tyler herro, Duncan Robinson, precious, nun, 2 1sts, 4 pick swaps and considering what they got from Brooklyn y’all probably could’ve negotiated and gave way less if you didn’t make Tyler herro untouchable"
Heat Culture is refusing to trade Tyler Herro for James Harden.   Sure Harden is better at everything but he just isn't a fit. You wouldn't understand. It's a culture thing
"Tyler ""Not the Hero"" Herro"
heat didnt want to trade bubble boy jr aka tyler herro
"Clips for sure, I really didn’t expect the Heat this year to be better than last year, what have they done for me to expect better results? All I see as an outsider is a team who didn’t keep guys who were very helpful in the playoffs (Crowder, Olynyk who put up 24 points in game 2 and 17 in game 3 of last year’s finals) while not really adding anything other than dudes like Dewayne Dedmon. If Tyler Herro had a breakout year this would be different in my mind, but nah I didn’t expect the Heat to beat a top 3 seed without a ton of luck."
Tyler”wouldn’t trade for Harden” Herro
Tyler “Untouchable” Herro
HERE COMES ~~AUSTIN RIVERS~~ TYLER HERRO
I’m still trying to remember who Tyler Herro was
Tyler Herro is Austin Rivers with Instagram followers.
"Would you want Jordan Poole or Tyler Herro at this point, ignore my flair"
Tyler Herro massively overrated
Imagine owning a Tyler Herro jersey
If Tyler Herro is the reason a James Harden trade wasn’t completed then someone in the Heat organization has to fall on that sword
Tyler Herro out here in garbage time grinding away in an attempt to preserve his bubble legacy
Finally! Tyler Herro vs Jeff Teague!
I'm calling it rn. Jordan Nwora is going to outscore Tyler Herro in this series.
The Tyler Herro slander is going to be delicious.
"The Heat had players to trade, the Nets did not. Tyler Herro is worth more than all the late first rounders the Nets gave up"
Member Tyler Herro?  *snarl*
Adam Sandler to play Tyler Herro in Bubble Boy 2
Imagine not trading Tyler Fucking Herro for James Fucking Harden
does tyler herro contribute anything to this team?
Tyler Herro sucks man. He had one decent season and it all went to his head. He's gotta figure it out next season or he'll be gone in a flash
Tyler Herro feeling dangerous again tonight with 7 points.
Lowry way better than Tyler herro
Should have traded Tyler herro for Lowry
"Tyler ""Harden/Lowry isn't worth trading me"" Herro with 7 pts through 3 quarters."
The Heat were too attached to Tyler Herro. If you can get James Harden you fucking get him
so tyler herro getting traded this offseason or nah
Bro Tyler Herro trying to protect shooting % in a playoff game. Dude is a bitch.
"Tyler Herro, superhero, guitar hero, don't matter... Bucks in 4"
"&gt;No one talks shit about Miami   Bro WHAT? Have you even been on this sub the last few days? We're the bubble boys, Jimmy isn't even top 20, Tyler Herro is the worst player in the NBA, and Bam is a role player according to this sub. Get the absolute fuck out of here with that victim bullshit. Miami has been getting *shredded* on here."
"""we will not include tyler herro in any trade discussions""  lmao!!"
But Tyler herro is untouchable.... lol.....
* The rest of the conference got better. * They lost high level role players in Kelly Olynyk and Jae Crowder. * Goran Dragic declined because of old age/his finals injury. * Iguodala declined because of old age. * Tyler Herro declined because he didn't work on his game/body properly this summer. * Bam? * Budenholzer finally realized he could put Giannis on Butler.   They had a +3.0 net rating last year (7th in the league) and a -0.2 net rating this season (16th in the league). This team just isn't that good outside of Jimmy/Bam/Robinson.
"We got worse. Jae Crowder was a huge contributor for us last season, and Tyler Herro has slumped. Dragic got older and cant put up the same 20ppg. Anyone thinking this is the same team that made the finals isnt paying attention."
"Those Tyler Herro Autographed Rookie Cards that people were buying up are going to plummet in value after this season, yikes."
tyler herro and jimmer freddette gonna make a killer backcourt in china
Heat culture is great. Tyler Herro untradable.
Tyler Herro? More like Big HECKIN Zero
"“Tyler Herro just got something different about him man, future goat”"
Ask Tyler Herro
From Tyler Herro to Tyler Zerro   From Bam Adebayo to Bum Adebayo   Who else next?
"Pat Riley doesnt get enough shit for his roster building/decision making. Year after year of giving the bank out to guys like james johnson, tyler johnson, dion waiters, hassan whiteside etc.... not giving up herro for harden. But butler went to them and bailed them out and their success last season all of their misses are/were forgotten. Honestly if the team wasnt in Miami they might still be a lottery team"
"This is my first season watching basketball, how did the Heat get stuck with someone as bad as Tyler Herro? Didnt they make the finals last year?"
“What happened to Tyler Herro” is a very common question these days.
Tyler herro the most overrated player man  yall got tricked  bubble ass player
Lmao those Tyler Herro post bubble hype posts are going to be legendary
"Tyler Herro? What happened? Right now is a key moment for him to step up for the Heat.  &amp;#x200B;  Milwuakee looking solid, improved from last year for sure."
"what happened to Tyler ""wouldn't trade him for Harden - Heat fans"" Herro?"
"Tyler Herro has “No Work, No Check” tattooed on his chest lol"
I feel like Tyler Herro has to win for player that thinks they are better than they are. Top 3 at least.  Anyone else come to mind?
Tyler Herro 4/20?  That snarl cursed him.
Well at least the Heat have a budding superstar Tyler Herro to build around for the future instead of an aging vet like James Harden
"&gt;When Harden was available via trade, Heat were reportedly interested in Harden, and the Rockets asked for Robinson, Achiuwa, Nunn, salary filler, 2FRP, 4 pick swaps and... Tyler Herro. Since the Heat were able to reach the Finals last year with Herro playing a pivotal role, they were unwilling to part with the young bubble star, and proceeded to bank on Herro &amp; the other young guys instead of getting Harden (of the greatest offensive players in history). This was wishful thinking. Herro will likely be in his prime when Butler is out of his.   That trade is literally impossible lmao. We don't have 2 FRPs to trade. So either that offer got immediately turned down because it literally couldn't happen or it wasn't true to begin with."
"What a dud, playoff Jimmy is nowhere to be found and Tyler Herro is a one hit wonder"
Damn Tyler Herro really peaked at 21 lol
"Clippers need to give up Kawhi, PG, Beverly, and 3 first round picks for the value of one Tyler Herro.   Don’t see it happening"
tyler herro gives off oj mayo/brandon jennings vibes. see you in china!
Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson are missing in action.
"I'm 73% sure that Jimmy and Herro had a spit roast and touched tips, which Tyler hasn't mentally recovered from."
So the RJ Barrett Tyler Herro debate can officially be put to bed right? It’s clear RJ is at least one tier above Herro
"Tyler herro just has a ton of people that hate him for whatever reason lol. Guaruntee that OP knew this shit was misleading but just felt like getting some herro hate going. I mean, he's played decently since the ASB overall (at least that's what I thought), so I guess this type of thread was overdue.   Btw, did you know that the heat wouldn't trade Tyler herro for James Harden straight up???^not ^true ^but ^who ^cares ^lol"
"Tyler ""3rd pick in redraft"" Herro"
God help any team with Tyler Herro as their star player
"Bro they know 99% of people wont bother checking. Just look at the recent Tyler Herro ""Revenge Tour"" thread. Anyone who took 1 minute out of their time would see that the reporter brought it up and Tyler just agreed with him in a humble way."
But think of his potential; Tyler Herro could be *anything!*  Even James Harden!
"If Tyler Herro thinks he is a guy with a ceiling of a bad defending role player, sure."
Kevin Huerter is what everyone thinks Tyler Herro is
"Believe me, I would love to shit on Tyler Herro and his stupid ass snarling face rn, but this post is an awful misrepresentation of the linked video. Herro barely claims anything, it's just a generic post-game and the interviewer is the one pushing the ""Revenge Tour"" thing  Fuck you OP"
He forgot Tyler Herro
Did Tyler Herro shit his pants as bad as the box score suggests?
Tyler herro is too SOFT and KAT slept with his MOM
Every game that Tyler Herro plays I get more pissed about Game 4 of the East Finals
I think Tyler Herro is over hated.
Hated on by this sub? I'll take Tyler Herro for $1000 Alex.
"And then he has Tyler Herro around him and he’s like, ‘Pull that video up.’ And then Herro goes and pulls it up!"
"There were multiple games there where Tyler Herro or Bam Adebayo were the best players on their teams. More times than not honestly. They got to the finals off team basketball, Jimmy wasn’t carrying them there on his back like Tatum and Brown were."
what about Tyler - Herro
"&gt;Lol, your team chose Tyler Herro over James Harden  How to expose yourself as a casual 101"
"Lol, your team chose Tyler Herro over James Harden, it’s going to be so satisfying seeing your team possibly miss the playoffs this year and go back to being shit"
"Tyler ""better than Harden"" Herro  &gt;!/s!&lt;"
"Tyler ""better than Tatum"" Herro"
Tyler Herro is the worst player to ever have a hit song made about them
“Tyler Herro misses the easiest shot in his entire heat career” LMAOOO they really flamed him for that
"Tyler Herro  Asking a rookie to be the best player on a championship team is way too unrealistic, not even MJ or Lebron could do that"
"The main question was about why people picked Tyler Herro over Russell now, so I don't know why you're comparing their seasons at age 20, AND even mentioning contracts. The ESPN fact was just to show about disrespected Dlo is.  Why were people viewing Herro as a better player than Russell? Do YOU think Herro is a better player than Russell?"
Tyler Herro should be bolded.
That one Tyler Herro spot tho. Funny how that worked out
"Heat sweep the Bucks behind Tyler Herro averaging a quintuple triple, Adam Silver forces Milwaukee to buy out Giannis' contract and trade away all their draft picks up until the year 3000 for cash considerations, and Jason Kidd is named Bucks coach for kife"
"THT is mot a better player than MPJ, Tyler Herro, Cam Johnson, RJ Barrett, De’andre Hunter, Brandon Clark, Kendrick Nunn, Terence Davis, PJ Washington, or Thybulle. And that’s just from the top of my head.    He’s a good player, but thinking that he’s top 3 in that draft class is absurd homerism."
Stop being delusional. Its ridiculous that you would put THT in the same sentence as Zion. If he wasnt on the Lakers I doubt you would even talk about him. Also Tyler Herro is a rookie and had a good stretch in the playoffs.
"Tyler Herro will be much better next season because he'll realize how much he let the fame get to his head.   Either that or he'll continue to plateau (possibly regress) and be out the league in 5 years.  His personality says the latter, but Im going with the former. Its close tho."
BuT tYlEr HeRrO
"man, plays of Tyler Herro gonna be way down. Jack Harlow might have to take it off the set list"
"Tyler Herro: 1/5 for 2 pts. Duncan Robinson: 0/3 for 0 pts. But hey, Harden is worse."
*Heat Culture* could use some James Harden right about now  Wait wtf am I talking about. They have Tyler Herro he’s even better ^/s
Bubble fluke was right. And Tyler herro is bubble boy he's ass you can't change my mind.
Miami fans really defended keeping tyler herro over getting james harden lol.
Has anyone drank their own bathwater more than Tyler Herro? They gotta put a tighter leash on this dude.
Tyler Herro is so overated
ur right the bubble was definitely legit. that’s why TJ warren and tyler herro are superstars now
Wtf happened to Tyler Herro
Who was Tyler Herro supposed to become?
Why would they regret not trading Tyler herro for one of the best scorers in NBA history!?
Pat Riley wishes he could go back in time to that Harden and Tyler Herro trade
"[Magic Johnson]: The Miami Heat need to play better! Specifically, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Trevor Ariza, Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, Goran Dragic, Udonis Haslem, Coach Spo, Pat Riley, their fans"
Tyler Herro
Tyler Herro. I still think he’ll be a good player but I know a lot of people were expecting him to be a lot better this season
him and tyler herro doing awkward kings of dade county ads
"no because they have to focus on Harden, KD, and Kyrie instead of Jimmy Butler, Bam and Tyler Herro"
He's no Tyler Herro tho. 😎
