That’s possible. Like Leandro Bolmaro... one year more at ACB league ... Garuba it’s really good player. It’s depends on...
"I agree with you to an extent but I also think it depends. Like Point guards have the steepest learning curve but Center's still have to call out coverages and learn defense and stuff. I think the rankings of positional NBA transition difficulty go    1. Point guards and Primary creators (Killian Hayes, Leandro Bolmaro)   2. Centers and defensive bigs (Wiseman, Mobley, Isaiah Jackson)   3. Off the bounce scorers (Cam Thomas, Tyler Herro)   4. Plug n' play wings ( Devin Vassell, Moses Moody)"
You haven't seen everything yet. Leandro Bolmaro gonna take it to a whole new level.
"I believe they do. ANT, KAT, DLo, and Jaden McDaniels are the future of this organization. Couple that with Beasley, a proven 20 PPG scorer who can either be a lethal 6th man or a trade piece for an athletic defensively sound rim protector, and Leandro Bolmaro, our third first rounder this last year who shows promise, and you have something there. Not to mention Finch has show real promise as a savvy X’s and O’s guy who’s got a good coaching background and a capacity for leadership."
"Facu Campazzo in Denver. Tortu Deck in OKC. Leandro Bolmaro drafted by the Wolves. Flor Chagas drafted by the Indiana Fever, the first Argentine woman in WNBA history.  And now Luca to the Knicks. What a great year this has been for Argentina basketball :D"
Let me introduce you Leandro Bolmaro.
dont forget barca also has 2021-2022 NBA ROY and MVP leandro bolmaro
"You forgot Jaden McDaniels, Leandro Bolmaro, and our savior who will lead us to the promised land, Naz Reid."
"lots of promise but that's Minne in a nutshell;   between Jmac, JMac, Ant, D Lo, KAT, then you add DBook, and even Leandro Bolmaro looking crispy over in EU   so starting five would maybe look like, DLo, Book, Ant, JMac, and KAT, and in the east it seems you want your best defenders to be SF/PF wouldn't hurt to find one or two guards and a paint defender for KAT relief"
"Just by virtue of coming back healthier I think the Wolves should see a decent jump next year.   If we keep the pick, even better! That said we started 2 rookies for most of the year in Ant and Jaden and there’s also talk that Leandro Bolmaro could come over next season."
"It doesn't make Minny look good, but the element of luck for you to land him.  He was supposedly not interested in Minnesota, and he didn't try out with us.  Jonny Flynn had a great Tournament run (also remember we had an insanely incompetent GM in David Kahn, who was someone who wanted to make a splash, and thought Rubio was that splash).    We also had our GM/Coach DIE on us shortly after drafting KAT.  Who knows what Flip could have done with Wiggins/LaVine/Towns  Absolutely agree with you on the last part.  How can we as a fan base trust anything any management does after something like that, though!  We've been pretty lucky with Rosas gnabbing Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels, and Leandro Bolmaro in this years draft.  I truly think we as a roster currently constructed without those players would have been doomed.  Now we got to make sure we build with these 3 at the forefront.  I am a Minny fan that doesn't think KAT is a first option yet, and probably will never be."
Any chance Leandro bolmaro will see some game time ?
Leandro Bolmaro
Three team trade: Minnesota/Toronto/Philly  Minnesota receives Ben Simmons Toronto receives Ricky Rubio and 2020 first rounder Leandro Bolmaro and perhaps a future first  Philly receives Kyle Lowry and picks/filler.  Obviously trade needs to balance with other players added for salary matching reasons but Philly gets local boy with championship pedigree who is win now and fits with Embiid. Toronto get Ricky on an expiring who they can flip again and a top Argentinian who played for Barcelona last season and should fit into the Raptors international roster. Minnesota can put Simmons together with KAT and have Coach Finch make music between them. You still have Dlo in the back court and Ant-man scoring all over the place.
"Well, he’s obviously not Luka Doncic. The thing about Euroleague is that young guys do not often get playing time. It’s not a feeder for the NBA: These teams have plenty of grown ass men, former NBA players, etc who will get playing time over promising young players.  There was a very in-depth analysis on him here:  https://www.canishoopus.com/2021/6/24/22530528/what-could-leandro-bolmaro-be-timberwolves-2021-nba-draft   He’s a good and extremely aggressive defender. Good size and general athleticism. He’s got promise as a Jack of all trades forward who can shoot, playmake and defend at a quality NBA level."
1. Bring Leandro Bolmaro over 2. Re-sign Vanderbilt 3. Trade for Myles Turner 4. Trade for Marvin Bagley
guys it's okay we don't have our pick we have LEANDRO BOLMARO coming over! get hyped! (thanks for him btw)
Drafted 3 rookies last year one was a draft and stash in Leandro Bolmaro his biggest weakness was his shot now he shoots 40%  from 3 in the euro league we knew this could happen so we drafted him just incase
Its cool we got Leandro Bolmaro coming from the euro league drafted him last year
"i'd love to see d'lo and dinwiddie play together again, but we really don't need morw guards tbh.  we have d'lo, rubio, beasley, ant, jaylen nowell, jordan mclaughlin, and then leandro bolmaro seems like he's coming over from barca for next season"
"Minnesota is not giving up KAT or Ant in any deal for at least 2 more seasons. It only works if Portland is ready to go in a full on rebuild with picks. The ""stars"" of the deal for Portland would be Jaden McDaniels and probably Leandro Bolmaro, then probably Malik Beasley and Juancho and whatever else to make the numbers work. From there, they'd get a metric ton of picks and I'm sure they could demand one of the better prospects from the 76ers as well. The team giving away the best player almost never wins, unfortunately."
"So since Usman is allowed to come over now, does that mean Leandro Bolmaro is coming too?"
Leandro Bolmaro
Leandro Bolmaro fam. Remember the name. We next.
"&gt; Blazers get: (from Minny) Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, LeAndro Bolmaro   LMAO."
"The Wolves top 3 players (KAT, D-Lo, Ant) are better than the Kings top 3 players (Fox, Barnes, Haliburton).   The Kings have better back-end starters. Holmes, Hield, and Mitchell are better than McDaniels, Beasley, and Naz Reid.   The Wolves bench has Taurean Prince, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Josh Okogie, Jake Layman, and Leandro Bolmaro.   The Kings bench has Tristan Thompson, Marvin Bagley, Mo Harkless, Terence Davis, Jahmi'us Ramsey, and Neemias Queta.   The Wolves have the better bench.   The Wolves head coach is Chris Finch. The Kings head coach is Luke Walton.   The Wolves have the better head coach.   Based on this, the Wolves are more likely to be successful this season."
"Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, and Leandro Bolmaro vs some guy, who y’all got?"
But he does exist. His name is Leandro Bolmaro.
"wolves sub collectively has a crush on our draft-and-stash rookie from last year Leandro Bolmaro. His best attributes are his smile and his can-do attitude, but he's also a tenacious defender who has a sweet handle and pass game and can knock down a 3. He was also named the ""Most Spectacular Player"" in the Spanish ACB league. (The award is essentially if the person who had the most espn top 10 plays was given an award for it)"
"DENVER: Marquese Chriss, Bam Adebayo, Troy Brown Jr., Leandro Bolmaro; other 1st rounders would be Guerschon Yabusele and Caris LeVert"
He's second behind Leandro Bolmaro.
Him and Leandro Bolmaro 1a and 1b imho
"Leandro Bolmaro,"
Leandro Bolmaro is playing meaningful minutes for my basketball team. I'm in heaven
"Timberwolves - early observation would be they have potential to compete with anybody if their 3s fall, they pass the rock to get the open man, and most importantly they play intense team defense - Pat Bev has surprised me for the better, his presence has definitely made an impact with the defense and mentality of the team - Bev is awesome just gritty, shit talking, playing hard as anyone could, love the guy; Prince has been alright when the 3s fall, shot seems to be inconsistent; Bolmaro has potential and I like him, hard to get playing time outside of garbage time in blowouts, killed it in his first game for the Iowa Wolves showing he belongs in the league - Bolmaro is looking the best out of the rookies we got right now; MW3 saw a bit of playing time in a blowout other than that has been on the bench or in Iowa with Leandro  - Finch is a boss, total 180 from Ryan Saunders. If any team wants a supreme tank commander give Ryan a call"
